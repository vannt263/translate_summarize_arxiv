    "the carnot engine plays a crucial role in the foundations of thermodynamics .",
    "however , it can not be realized in practice since its output power is infinitesimally small due to its reversibility .",
    "real thermal engines can not work as slowly as carnot engines to preserve equilibrium and must lose energy during the working cycles due to various reasons .",
    "this makes the efficiency of real thermal engines below that of an ideal carnot engine . to optimize the thermal engines in the real world ,",
    "a lof of `` realistic '' models have been established and studied in the literature@xcite .",
    "one of the most practical problem associated with the optimization of real heat engines is its efficiency at maximum power .",
    "this problem was firstly studied by curzon and ahlborn in 1975@xcite . for carnot - like heat engines",
    ", the authors assumed that the temperature differences between the heat reservoirs and working substance are finite and fixed , thus the two heat transferring processes are not reversible anymore , while the adiabatic expansion and compression processes are still reversible . under these assumptions",
    ", they derived the well - known ca efficiency @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs with which the working substance is in contact . though the ca formula has a good agreement with measured efficiencies of some thermal plants , this model still has some intrinsic drawbacks . on one hand ,",
    "it gives neither an exact nor constraint result for the efficiency as pointed out by ref.@xcite . on the other hand , in real world",
    "situations the temperature differences between the working medium and heat reservoirs are not constant and the heat transferring process could be governed by some more general physical laws which can incorporate temperature changing during heat transferring processes .    in our previous work on classical engines@xcite",
    ", we have seen that the heat transfer law plays a crucial role on the efficiency at maximum power problem . for carnot engines , the time periods for which the adiabatic expansion and compression processes last are usually negligibly short , while those of the two isothermal heat transferring processes are infinitely long , therefore carnot engines have zero output power . in real world situations",
    ", the isothermal heat transferring processes must last for a finite period of time and obey specific heat transferring laws .",
    "in ref.@xcite , we studied a thermal engine model for which newton s cooling law is obeyed during the heat transferring processes , and derived the upper and lower bounds for the efficiency at maximum power in the long and short contact time limits respectively . by considering the heat transferring processes during which the temperature of the working medium is close to or far from isothermal , and adjusting the ratio between the heat capacities of the heating and cooling stages ,",
    "the model can simulate different types of engines including but not limited to carnot engines .",
    "the studies of classical thermal engines can be generalized to their quantum counterparts .",
    "recently , different models of quantum thermal engines are extensively studied in the literature@xcite .",
    "the efficiency of a quantum thermal engine at maximum power has also been studied in ref.@xcite , where the quantum thermal engine is based on the model discussed in ref.@xcite , in which the quantum thermal engine is composed of particles confined in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) infinite potential well , and the wall of the well can expand to perform work .",
    "the derived efficiency at maximum power is a universal number .",
    "following the same spirit , we try to generalize our previous work to the quantum world . for simplicity and without losing generality , the working substance in our model of thermal engines",
    "is a two - level quantum system@xcite , which can be chosen as the lowest two levels of a 1d infinite quantum well or a 1d harmonic oscillator . unlike the discussion in ref.@xcite , the temperature rather than average energy",
    "is used to describe the thermal equilibrium state as in ref.@xcite .",
    "what is important here is that the heat transferring process between the working substance and the heat reservoir is described by einstein s theory of radiation .",
    "this can be thought as the quantum version of the model discussed in ref.@xcite in some way . for simplicity",
    ", we denote this kind of quantum thermal engine by `` quantum einstein engine '' .",
    "we are interested in the efficiency and its bounds at maximum power .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first study the quantum thermal engine of which the constituent particles of the working substance obey the m.b.(maxwell - boltzmann ) distribution .",
    "this will shed light on our successive studies on the other two models .",
    "for this model , we derive the heat transferring law based on einstein s theory of radiation , and give the formulas of the heat transfer and entropy production . as in ref.@xcite , we study the efficiency at maximum power and its bounds in the long and short contact time limits .",
    "we also study quantum engines for which f.d.(fermi - dirac ) and b.e.(bose - einstein ) distributions are applied .",
    "the working substance of our quantum thermal engine is assumed to be a two - level quantum system with energy levels @xmath3 ( low ) and @xmath4 ( high ) .",
    "the energy difference of the two levels is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the planck s constant .",
    "the particle numbers at low and high energy levels are @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , and the fixed total particle number is given by @xmath9 . for simplicity",
    ", we first consider the case that the constituent particles of the quantum system satisfy m.b .",
    "distribution at equilibrium states .",
    "assume the initial temperature of the system is @xmath10 , then the initial particle distributions are @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant . in our model of quantum thermal engine , the heat reservoir can be thought of as a black - body source with temperature @xmath14 .",
    "when the working substance or the two - level quantum system is `` in contact with '' a black - body source , the heat is transferred by the photon emission and absorbtion .",

    "we have used the fact @xmath46 .",
    "generically , the energy levels of the quantum working substance during the heating and cooling stages are different since the engine must expand to perform work between the two stages .",
    "we assume that the frequencies associated with the heating and cooling stages are @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , and the initial and final inverse temperatures are @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 respectively .",

    "the cycles of the quantum engine are as follows .",
    "1)the system absorbs heat @xmath60 from the hot reservoir during the time period @xmath61 .",

    "thewidth \" of the harmonic potential expands while its spring constant  shrinks \" from @xmath64 to @xmath65 in its parameter space . 3)the system releases heat @xmath66 at the cold reservoir during the time period @xmath67 .",
    "4)the system returns to its original size and temperature and the working medium returns to its original state .      when the contact time is long enough , the working substance can exchange heat sufficiently with the reservoirs . in this limit , @xmath68 is large , and we assume the final inverse temperatures for the two stages are @xmath69 and @xmath70 . hence the heat transfers during the two stages are @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 . to the leading order of @xmath29 , the constraint @xmath74 gives @xmath75 of which the solution is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",

    ". the quantum engine , either quantum - well type or harmonic - oscillator type , must expand to perform work after absorbing heat at hot reservoir .",
    "hence its size must increase afterwards . for a quantum - well type engine ,",

    "distribution ) . here",
    "we still adopt the same convention for the parameters as in the last section .",
    "for each level of the quantum system , the particle numbers of the initial state are given by @xmath123 similar to what we have done in the last section , the distribution function @xmath124 is introduced .",
    "thus the initial number distributions are @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
