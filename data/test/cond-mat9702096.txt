    "the equilibrium shape of a crystal surface undergoes a roughening transition from a rough high temperature phase to a smooth low temperature phase as the temperature is decreased @xcite . above the roughening transition @xmath0 , the height fluctuations grow logarithmically with the dimension of the system @xmath1 and below the transition the height is smooth and is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the non - equilibrium counterpart , the growth mechanism of such crystals , provides more insights about the roughening transition @xcite .",
    "it is found that for @xmath2 the growth is non - activated in nature whereas for @xmath3 , the growth is essentially by nucleation of droplets and the growth velocity is exponentially slow in the inverse of the force . for an infinitesimal force @xmath4 , the mobility which is the ratio of the growth velocity and @xmath4 vanishes with a jump from a finite value at the transition . with a finite force",
    "the transition is blurred .",
    "the flat phase is destroyed over large length scale and eventually becomes rough . in this case a continuous decrease of the mobility is observed as the temperature is lowered @xcite .    an interesting development in this direction",
    "is the inclusion of the disorder of the underlying substrate @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the growing surface shows a new transition which is the super roughening transition at temperature @xmath5 . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the height fluctuation is the same as the high temperature phase of the usual roughening transition but for @xmath7 the surface is rougher than the thermal phase .",
    "there is a controversy regarding the roughness of this super rough phase @xcite though a recent numerical treatment @xcite favors the size dependence of the roughness as @xmath8 .",
    "a dynamical renormalization group treatment @xcite shows that for @xmath6 the effect of the disorder essentially vanishes over large length scales and the scaling properties of the surface are the same as that of a surface growing on a pure substrate , in the rough phase .",
    "the linear response mobility in this super roughening transition vanishes continuously , unlike a jump in the case of the roughening transition , as @xmath5 is approached from the high temperature phase . for @xmath7",
    "there is a temperature dependent dynamical exponent and a nonlinear response of the system to an external force .",
    "the connection between these roughening and super roughening transitions has been elucidated furthermore by a renormalization group treatment of the growth on a substrate with a correlated disorder @xcite .",
    "the roughening transition turns into a super roughening transition as the correlation of the disorder decays sufficiently fast . by tuning the power law of the long range correlation of the disorder it is possible to go from the pure to the short range disorder limit .",
    "such growth problems for crystals need to take into account the periodicity perpendicular to the crystal surface and is usually incorporated in the growth equation by a periodic pinning potential . the low temperature , flat phase in the roughening transition is due to the relevance of this pinning potential .    the nonequilibrium growth problem is complicated .",
    "one has to take into account a relevant nonlinear term that appears due to the lateral growth of an oblique surface @xcite .",
    "one of the major consequences of this kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) nonlinearity is a power law ( not logarithmic ) growth of height fluctuations . in the context of the nonequilibrium situation of a crystal surface",
    ", it has been argued that with a finite force such a nonlinear term is generated by the interplay of the force and this pinning potential @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the surface might then be determined by the nonlinearity which can destroy the roughening transition .",
    "a rough phase can appear even at low temperature .",
    "if one starts with a nonlinear term , the lateral growth and the pinning potential combinedly lead to a phase factor in the pinning potential @xcite .",
    "this phase factor is also renormalized as one looks at the system over larger length scales .",
    "the renormalization of the phase factor makes the identification of the phases a nontrivial problem .",
    "the disorder substrate case is also not well understood .",
    "previous analysis in this direction with a short range correlation of the disorder of the lattice showed that in the presence of the nonlinearity a small driving force is relevant and the asymptotic properties are essentially governed by the nonlinear term since the finite velocity leads to a smearing of the pinning potential @xcite . a numerical investigation on the other hand showed a generation of a quenched random mobility @xcite and hence a new universality class .",
    "the latter has been attributed essentially to the effect of a finite lattice cutoff .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question of a large scale description of the dynamics of a growing surface in the presence of a disorder on the underlying lattice and a kpz type nonlinearity discussed before .",
    "we consider a very general form of the disorder correlation . in view of the conflicting scenario mentioned above our analysis",
    "is based on a renormalization group technique that involves a finite lattice cutoff .",
    "a standard way of describing such a growth phenomena is to start from the equation of motion for the height @xmath9 at time @xmath10 and at coordinate @xmath11 in the two dimensional plane .",
    "as mentioned before the lattice structure orthogonal to the crystal surface is respected through the inclusion of a periodic potential .",
    "the equation of motion we need to study is therefore the usual sine - gordon equation @xcite subjected to a constant driving force @xmath4 @xmath12 + { \\overline{\\lambda}}/2(\\nabla \\phi)^2+f+r({\\bf r},t ) \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 denotes the stiffness of the surface , @xmath14 is the microscopic mobility , @xmath15 is the strength of the pinning potential . here",
    "@xmath16 represents the strength of the nonlinearity that allows a lateral growth of the surface and @xmath17 represents the thermal noise at temperature @xmath18 with a short range correlation given by @xmath19 in the presence of a random substrate we expect that the minima of the periodic potential will be randomly shifted and this is incorporated in this equation through a quenched random variable @xmath20 .",
    "we consider here a general form of the correlation associated with this random phase shift @xmath20 , as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and the overbar denotes average over the disorder . at this point we do not specify the functional form of @xmath23 but later we concentrate on @xmath24 .",

    "various limiting forms of this equations which have been studied are as follows .",
    "( i ) the most well studied limit is @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the pure equilibrium growth that shows a roughening transition is obtained with @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the width of the growing surface is conventionally described by the following scaling @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the roughening exponent and @xmath31 is the dynamical exponent . above the roughening transition ,",
    "the width scales as @xmath32 $ ] , which implies @xmath33 . in the low temperature",
    "flat phase @xmath34 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "( iii ) the nonequilibrium situation of this pure problem is described by equation [ eq2 ] with @xmath35 , with or without @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "( iv ) the short range correlated disorder on the substrate follows from @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this shows the continuous super roughening transition .",
    "( v ) a long range correlated disorder with @xmath37 and @xmath38 shows the interpolation between the roughening and super roughening transition @xcite .",
    "another interesting limit , @xmath39 and a quenched noise @xmath40 was used to study the dynamics of driven interface in a disordered medium @xcite .    in a renormalization group ( rg )",
    "approach the system is looked at longer length scales by integrating out the effects of small scale fluctuations .",
    "when the system is rescaled to the original scale , the effect of the small scale fluctuations goes into the renormalization of the various parameters of the problem .",
    "the effective coupling constant observed at a certain length scale is then given by the rg recursion relations . in this approach , in all the above cases except ( ii ) with @xmath41 , @xmath42 has been found not to be renormalized .",
    "the important new feature that arises in our case is the renormalization of the nonlinearity due to the nonlocal property of the correlator .",
    "we obtain a surprising result that this nonlinearity decays initially with the length scale for @xmath43 .",
    "however the possible generation of a force and its relevance can cause a truncation of this decay of the nonlinearity and the growth asymptotically becomes kpz like . in order to treat the long range correlation in general",
    ", we use the functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach where the renormalization of the correlation function @xmath44 and its effect on the other parameters are studied .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to the description of the effective generating functional . in section",
    "iii we derive the functional renormalization group flow equation with necessary diagrams .",
    "at this point we might add that our approach is simpler than the dimensional regularization approach of ref @xcite .",

    "this violation of fdt has previously been argued in the dynamics of random phase sine gordon model @xcite .",
    "the diagrams corresponding to the correlation and response functions are presented in fig 1 along with the other two vertices @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 denote the fields at @xmath69 .",

    "the nonlocality of the correlator requires a more general treatment presented in the appendix .",
    "there is a possible new renormalization of the pinning potential due to the nonlinearity .",
    "a straightforward diagrammatic expansion would produce two loop diagrams @xcite as shown on the left sides of fig 2b and fig2c.to include the effect of these in our rg scheme , we have to involve new vertices whose one loop contribution would be equivalent to the effect of original diagrams .",

    ", we recover the equations of ref .",
    "the recursion relation for the correlator of the form @xmath109 for large @xmath110 , implies that @xmath25 remains unchanged under renormalization , as has been observed in ref .",
    "it is only the amplitude @xmath111 that is renormalized .",
    "it is also apparent from eq [ eq12d ] , that for @xmath108 the relevance or irrelevance of @xmath44 is determined by the value of @xmath112 , that plays the role of temperature . for a perfect crystal with @xmath113 , @xmath114 determines the roughening transition whereas for short range disorder , @xmath36 , this boundary is at @xmath115  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath116 the flow equation shows that @xmath42 is invariant under renormalization .",
    "this is in agreement with ref @xcite .",
    "for any other short range form of @xmath44 ( e.g. exponentially decaying @xmath44 ) , it is possible to see from eq [ new ] , that the width of the correlation defined as @xmath117 vanishes as one approaches @xmath118 .",
    "interestingly , for a long range form of @xmath44 as mentioned above the integral converges for @xmath119 .",
    "this @xmath120 is the borderline for the roughening and super roughening transition@xcite .",

    "@xcite , namely that the large scale behavior of the growing surface is kpz like and the super roughening transition is lost . with a power law correlation of the disorder , this short range limit",
    "is achieved when @xmath119 .",
    "let us now consider @xmath121 .",
    "note that the integral over @xmath110 in the flow equation for @xmath42 is the same as that in the flow equation for @xmath88 .",
    "therefore with @xmath122 , this integral is positive as long as @xmath123 as in ref @xcite . as a consequence of this",
    "the nonlinearity decreases with the length scale .",
    "this is quite an astonishing feature arising due to the nonlocality of the correlator .",
    "recall that the @xmath42 term occurs to take into account the lateral growth of the surface .",
    "our result suggests that at least at the initial stage , the lateral growth of the evolving surface is inhibited by the long distance correlation of the quenched substrate disorder .",
    "the effect of this decrease of @xmath42 implies that the super roughening transition is unaffected up to the length scale below which our treatment with a @xmath124 is valid .",
    "if we stop at this leading order of the flow equations , then from @xcite , we can argue that for @xmath125 one would observe roughening transition .",
    "there is , however , a possibility of generation of a driving force due to the nonlinearity @xmath42 as given in the recursion relation [ eq12 g ] .",
    "the growth of this force with the length scale requires a non perturbative treatment of the force @xcite ( explained below ) and the decay of the nonlinearity is eventually prevented .",
    "the relevant length scale at which this crossover takes place , can be obtained by solving the coupled differential equation with and without the force term . also note that , to this order , the flow of @xmath42 and @xmath88 , under renormalization , has an invariance @xmath126 , the physical origin of which is not clear to us .",
    "let us consider a finite force case . according to reference @xcite a finite force for a perfect crystal ( @xmath127 ) implies a rough surface with the height fluctuations having a power law scaling with the length . to treat a finite force we redefine the height as @xmath128 where @xmath4 is the external force .",
    "this implies a replacement of the disorder part of the action as @xmath129\\ ] ] the next step is the splitting of cosine into a product of sine and cosine terms .",
    "most crucial is the renormalization of @xmath42 which follows from the possible contraction of the term @xmath130\\sin[(t - t')f]$ ] .",
    "this leads to the flow equation for @xmath42 analogous to that in the reference @xcite .",
    "we do not go into further details of the calculation since the procedure for extracting this term is similar to the details given in the appendices .",
    "the connection with reference @xcite can also be understood in our approach . there",
    "the equation of motion contains a random force .",

    "@xcite , appears through a new vertex @xmath104 of eq .",
    "[ gama1 ] again as a first term in the expansion of the periodic function .",
    "the random part of the kpz nonlinearity is not present in our work but it will obviously be generated in higher order of @xmath42 contributions . in other words , the terms that have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite are naturally generated or present as the leading order terms in our functional renormalization scheme with a finite cut off , though they do not occur in the dimensional regularization scheme of ref .",
    "we have treated the periodic function completely .",
    "it is clear from section iii that our renormalization is crucially dependent on the periodic function , and in fact , truncation to first order of the cosine will never lead to any renormalization of @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , the finite force scheme is also dependent on the periodic function .",
    "we are therefore not sure whether the leading order terms in the expansion of the cosine function of eqs .",
    "[ eq8 ] and [ gama1 ] can capture the whole effect , especially the question of a new universality class . to address this question one has to go to higher orders in rg .",
    "this remains to be done .",
    "in this paper we investigated the super roughening transition in presence of a nonlinearity supporting a lateral growth of the surface .",
    "the disorder is considered to have a long range correlation as discussed after eq [ eq3 ] . a functional renormalization group analysis using a finite momentum cutoff leads to flow equations for the parameters of the growing surface described by eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] and [ eq8 ] , and a flow equation for the disorder correlation .",
    "these equations ( [ eq12a]-[eq12 g ] ) predict the macroscopic properties of the surface .",

    "the lateral growth governed by the nonlinear term with coefficient @xmath42 is initially suppressed due to the long range disorder correlation .",
    "this is apparent from equation [ eq12f ] .",
    "therefore at least at the initial stage one might expect to see that the super roughening transition remains unaffected . over a large length scale",
    "a finite force can ultimately lead to a rough surface and destroy the transition .",
    "this requires a treatment of a finite force as discussed in section iv . in our analysis , we have taken a finite cutoff and have shown that the terms that have been predicted from numerical lattice simulations are really generated though our analysis envisages a more general term .",

    "the combined expression leads to the recursion relation for @xmath104 in eq .",
    "[ eq12e ] .",
    "the new vertex @xmath104 is completely the effect of renormalization .",
    "we notice that the possible one loop diagrams which contribute to the renormalization of the nonlinearity @xmath42 in the case of nonlocal correlator are those shown in fig 3 .",
    "there are other possible diagrams that could lead to a contribution in the renormalization of the nonlinearity .",
    "but we note that they cancel altogether . for example the diagrams shown in fig 6 .",
    "the expression corresponding to the diagrams in figure 3a is @xmath147 after the integration over the shell momentum @xmath148 we obtain @xmath149 furthermore the integration over the frequency leads to the final contribution of fig 3a as @xmath150 similarly the expression corresponding to fig 3b is @xmath151 after performing the integration over the momentum shell and the frequency , we get , @xmath152 an use of the relation @xmath153 and subsequent integration over @xmath10 leads to the following expression @xmath154 @xmath155 combining the contributions of fig 3a and fig 3b with appropriate symmetry factor we arrive at the recursion relation for @xmath42 .",

    "this is because , interestingly , the other two diagrams in fig 6a2 and 6b2 lead to the same contribution but _ with opposite sign _ , thereby canceling the contribution of figs 6a1 and 6b1 .",
