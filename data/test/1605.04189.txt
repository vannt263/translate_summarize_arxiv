    "it follows that the motion of the centre of mass and the particle rotation are connected to each other , and when the particle has spin the orbits will differ from geodesics of a spinless massive particle .",

    "orbital angular momentum at infinity @xmath104 can also be introduced as @xmath106 , see @xcite .    in the paper",
    "@xcite we present formulae for a small - spin linear corrections for @xmath43 , @xmath51 and @xmath107 at circular orbit with a given radius @xmath36 .",
    "it can be seen that for @xmath108 the total angular momentum equals to @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is total angular momentum for non - spinning particle . in spinless case",
    "it consists of orbital angular momentum part only , therefore @xmath111 .",
    "this justifies the introduction of orbital momentum at infinity just as difference between @xmath51 and @xmath11 .    for circular orbits at finite radius ( in particular , isco )",
    "orbital angular momentum can not be defined by such simple way @xcite . but using test body approximation @xmath103 allows us to use term corotation and counterrotation as terms for orbital motion .",
    "if we use tentatively the orbital angular momentum in the form @xmath106 for isco , we will get for the schwarzschild case : @xmath112 we see from ( [ l - orb ] ) and ( [ schw ] ) that increasing of positive @xmath94 leads to increasing of @xmath69 and decreasing of orbital angular momentum @xmath113 . at the same time the total angular momentum becomes bigger but",
    "it happens only due to increasing of its spin part .",
    "let us denote efficiency @xmath114 as the fraction of the rest mass energy that can be released in making the transition from rest at infinity to the innermost stable circular orbit @xcite , in our units it is given by @xmath115 note that in our notations @xmath43 is energy per unit particle rest mass .",
    "in other words the efficiency is the binding energy @xmath116 at isco per unit mass .",
    "the efficiency shows how much energy can be released by radiation during the accretion process . for the schwarzschild black hole and non - spinning test particle the efficiency equals to 0.057 , and it reaches maximum for the extreme kerr black hole  0.42 @xcite , @xcite .    in the case of spinning test particles we can easily calculate the efficiency with using of expressions for @xmath70 presented in ( [ schw ] ) , ( [ kerr - delta ] ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig - binding - energy ] .    for the schwarzschild black hole ( see ( [ schw ] ) ) the efficiency is : @xmath117 for extreme kerr black hole in case of orbital corotation ( see ( [ kerr - co ] ) ) , the efficiency is : @xmath118 it means that in case when particle spin is parallel to the total angular momentum of particle and the black hole spins , the efficiency can be larger than 42 % .",
