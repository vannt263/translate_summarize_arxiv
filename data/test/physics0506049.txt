    "paradoxes provide good opportunities to learn and teach physics .",
    "the long - standing paradox about the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a uniformly accelerated charge has received considerable attention .",
    "eminent figures such as pauli , born , sommerfeld , schott , von laue , and many others have contributed to this debate with different answers.@xcite the relevant questions we consider are : does a uniformly accelerated charge actually radiate ? in a constant gravitational field should free - falling observers detect any radiation emitted by free - falling charges ? is the equivalence principle valid for such situations ?",
    "if the answer to the first question is affirmative , a free - falling charge will radiate according to an observer at rest , because in a constant gravitational field , any particle should move with uniform acceleration .",
    "however , an observer falling freely with the charge would observe it at rest and no radiation at all .",
    "how can this answer be compatible with an affirmative answer to the first question ? moreover ,",
    "if the equivalence principle is assumed to be valid , we would conclude that a charged particle at rest on a table should radiate , because for free - falling inertial observers the particle is accelerating . to explain this puzzle",
    ", we need to recognize that the concept of radiation has no absolute meaning , and that it depends both on the radiation field and the state of motion of the observer.@xcite this dependence is the main conclusion of a celebrated and long debate , exhaustively presented in the recent series of papers by eriksen and grn,@xcite where the reader can find relevant references .",
    "inertial observers have no doubts about the answer to the first question .",
    "they will answer it affirmatively by using special relativity and maxwell s equations , as it is done in classical electrodynamics texts ( see , for example , ref .   whose conventions we adopt ) .",
    "nevertheless , comoving observers , that is , accelerated observers with respect to whom the charge is at rest , will not detect any radiation because the radiation field is confined to a spacetime region beyond a horizon that they can not access.@xcite as we will see , uniformly accelerated observers are able , in principle , to detect electromagnetic radiation from an inertial charge .",
    "these observations are enough to solve the paradoxes posed by the three questions .",
    "the last two conclusions are obtained by considering maxwell s equations for noninertial observers .",
    "we will show that we can conclude that comoving observers have no access to the radiation field of a uniformly accelerated charge .",
    "the concept of a horizon emerges naturally in this context .",
    "our approach is inspired by the recent analysis of this problem by gupta and padmanabhan@xcite whose result is much stronger .",
    "they show how to calculate the radiation field for an arbitrarily moving charge by solving maxwell s equations in the ( noninertial ) reference frame where the charge is at rest , and then transforming the electromagnetic field to the inertial reference frame by exploiting the tensorial character of maxwell s equations . as stressed in ref .",
    ", this is a remarkable result because the spatial and time dependences of the radiation field in the inertial frame have to be converted into the geometrical properties of the background metric of the reference frame where the charge is static .",
    "we take the converse approach here and will show that it is simple to conclude that the electromagnetic field generated by a uniformly accelerated charge is observed by a comoving observer as a purely electrostatic field .",
    "the speed of light @xmath0 is the maximum speed that a physical body can attain .",
    "thus the uniformly accelerated motion of a particle should have @xmath1 as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the proper time as measured by a comoving clock.@xcite it is easy to deduce that a particle moving with constant proper acceleration @xmath4 along the @xmath5 direction has a hyperbolic worldline given by the curve @xmath6 :    [ hyper ] @xmath7    there is no loss of generality if the motion is restricted to the @xmath5 direction .",

    "consider the point @xmath12 .",
    "its past light - cone intersects the hyperbolic trajectory . indeed , a large part of the trajectory ( @xmath13 ) is entirely contained inside its past light - cone , implying that the point @xmath12 could be causally influenced by signals emitted by the particle for @xmath14 ; no signal emitted for @xmath15 will influence @xmath12 , because the points of the trajectory with @xmath16 are not contained in the past light - cone of @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , a signal emitted in the space time @xmath12 will affect only the region corresponding to its future light - cone , implying that no signal emitted in @xmath12 will reach the particle moving according to eq .  .",
    "the line @xmath17 acts as a _ future event horizon _ for regions i and iv , or , equivalently , a _",
    "past event horizon _ for regions ii and iii .",
    "no signal emitted in regions ii or iii will reach regions i and iv , although signals emitted in i or iv can cross the line and enter into regions ii and iii .",
    "analogously , the line @xmath18 is a future event horizon for regions iii and iv , or a past event horizon for i and ii .    because the hyperbolic trajectory is entirely contained in region i , the lines @xmath17 and @xmath18 act , respectively , as the future and past horizons for a particle under uniformly accelerated motion .",

    "the main conclusion of ref .",
    "is that , even though radiation components are present in both regions , only observations performed in region ii ( and , perhaps , also on the boundary @xmath17 between regions i and ii ) would allow us to detect unambiguously the radiation emitted by the charge .",
    "this conclusion implies that the comoving observer would not detect any radiation at all , because region ii is inaccessible to uniformly accelerated observers.@xcite although this conclusion is correct , its logical derivation is involved and not intuitive .",
    "two regions of spacetime which have qualitatively distinct behavior for the radiation field according to inertial observers are identified and , then , it is shown that the comoving observers have access only to the region where inertial observers are not able to detect any radiation field.@xcite however , this conclusion does not directly imply that the comoving observers can not detect the radiation because , as we have discussed , the detection of radiation has no absolute meaning because the detection depends both on the radiation field and the state of motion of the observer .",
    "we can show directly that a comoving observer will observe the fields in eq .",
    "( [ ex ] ) as a static electric field .",
    "the reference frame of a uniformly accelerated observer corresponds to the rindler spacetime,@xcite which in our case is spanned by the coordinates @xmath45 defined by    [ rindler ] @xmath46    with @xmath47 .",
    "the particle under the hyperbolic motion ( [ hyper ] ) in the rindler reference frame is at rest at @xmath48 , and its proper time is measured by @xmath3 . in these coordinates the spacetime interval is given by @xmath49 note that the coordinates defined by eq .",
    "( [ rindler ] ) cover only region i of the original minkowski spacetime .",
    "because static observers ( @xmath50 is a constant ) correspond to uniformly accelerating observers in the original minkowski spacetime , their velocity in the inertial frame will approach @xmath0 as @xmath51 , implying that no signal coming from region ii will ever reach them ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned , the line @xmath17 behaves as an event horizon , and no signal emitted in regions ii or iii can escape into regions i and iv .",
    "the coordinate transformation ( [ rindler ] ) can be used to obtain the solution of maxwell s equations ( [ hom ] ) and ( [ nhom ] ) for the rindler spacetime with a charge @xmath28 at rest in @xmath48 .",
    "recall that the electromagnetic field @xmath37 is a tensor and hence under a coordinate transformation @xmath52 it transforms as@xcite @xmath53 because maxwell s equations ( [ hom ] ) and ( [ nhom ] ) are covariant under general coordinate transformations , @xmath54 will be a solution for the coordinate system @xmath55 if @xmath37 is a solution of eqs .",
    "( [ hom ] ) and ( [ nhom ] ) in the coordinate system @xmath56 .",
    "the magnetic components of @xmath54 are given by    [ tra ] @xmath57    strictly speaking , we need to be careful about the interpretation of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 as the components of the magnetic field as observed in the rindler reference frame .",

    "( [ nhom ] ) that the remaining nonvanishing components of the electromagnetic field are static , that is , @xmath69 , so that there is no radiation field in region i , the rindler reference frame .",
    "this result answers our question .",
    "a comoving observer will not detect any radiation from a uniformly accelerated charge .",
    "the comoving observer can receive signals only from regions i and iv .",
    "the field emitted by the accelerated charge does not reach region iv , and in region i , it is interpreted by the comoving observer as a static field .",
    "we note that essentially the same argument was used by rohrlich to show that in a static homogeneous gravitational field , static observers do not detect any radiation from static charges.@xcite    the situation is qualitatively different beyond the horizon in region ii .",
    "although uniformly accelerated observers will never receive any information from region ii , they can affect this region .",
    "the coordinate system ( [ rindler ] ) can be extended to include region ii by considering @xmath70 and    [ milne ] @xmath71    the metric ( [ rind ] ) and the expressions ( [ rr ] ) , valid for region i , also hold in region ii , but with a crucial difference due to the change of sign of the metric components : in region ii , @xmath50 instead of @xmath3 plays the role of a time parameter .",
    "thus the metric ( [ rind ] ) is not static in region ii .",
    "the magnetic components of @xmath54 in region ii can be obtained from transformations such as eq .",

    "the physics of the rindler space is sufficiently subtle to deserve some extra remarks .",
    "trajectories with constant @xmath50 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) correspond to uniformly accelerated trajectories in the inertial frame , but with _ distinct _ accelerations .",
    "the trajectory ( [ hyper ] ) corresponds to the static worldline @xmath48 in the rindler frame . from the inertial frame point of view",
    ", the true comoving observer should correspond also to @xmath48 , because any other static rindler observer would be in relative motion according to the inertial frame point of view with respect to the charge following eq .",
    "( [ hyper ] ) .",
    "our results show that the electromagnetic field of the uniformly accelerated charge is realized as a purely electrostatic field everywhere in the rindler frame , implying that even observers with @xmath74 , for which the charge is indeed accelerating when observed from the inertial point of view , would not detect the emitted radiation .",
    "this observation , which anticipates an intriguing quantum result described by matsas,@xcite reinforces the role played by the horizon , the unique property that the trajectories of these distinct observers have in common .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] )    the discussion can be considerably enriched by the introductions of quantum mechanical concepts . the classical radiation emitted by the accelerated charge in the inertial frame",
    "consists of a large number of real photons , which due to some subtle quantum effects can not be detected by comoving observers.@xcite to illustrate the novelties brought by quantum mechanics , consider in the minkowski space a uniformly accelerated observer following a trajectory such as that in eq .",
    "( [ hyper ] ) and a charge at rest at the origin .",
    "the worldline for this charge is the @xmath75 axis , and it is restricted to regions ii and iv .",
    "the solution of maxwell equations in the inertial frame is the static coulomb field @xmath76 which spreads over all four regions of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in region",
    "i , where a uniformly accelerated observer can detect any field coming from the charge , the static coulomb field will be measured by such observers as a time - depending electromagnetic field with components @xmath77 the fields ( [ el ] ) are solutions of the ( vacuum ) maxwell equations in region i as seen by uniformly accelerated observers .",
    "these fields have radiative components , although it is not so easy in this case to identify the terms dropping off as @xmath43.@xcite note that the accelerated observers are completely unaware of the charge fate in region ii .",
    "because they can detect only the contributions coming from regions i and iv , they will never discover what eventually happens to the charge in region ii if it , for instance , accelerates or even if it vanishes .",
    "an analysis of this problem based on quantum field theory , however , demands that the trajectory of the charge be entirely inside region i. is it possible to conclude something in this case ? astonishing the answer is yes.@xcite in the rindler reference frame static trajectories with @xmath78 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) correspond to uniformly accelerated trajectories in the inertial frame , restricted by construction to region i , but with proper acceleration @xmath79 .",
    "thus , they correspond to inertial trajectories !",
    "now we can answer the question of whether uniformly accelerated observers could detect any photon emitted by these specific inertial charges , and the answer is no.@xcite    the detection of radiation is not the only paradox involving accelerated charges .",
    "another very interesting paradox is related to the radiation reaction force .",
    "as we discussed , an inertial observer detects the radiation emitted by a uniformly accelerated charge .",
    "he / she can even calculate the ( nonvanishing ) total radiated power .",
