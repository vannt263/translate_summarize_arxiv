    "the ginzburg - landau model ( gl ) has been introduced almost half a century ago @xcite as a phenomenological model for superfluidity and superconductivity . in its one component order parameter version",
    "it has been used with remarkable success as a statistical mechanics model for the critical phenomena of systems lying in the same universality class as the ising model @xcite . in its @xmath3 component version coupled to abelian gauge fields it has been used as a model for superconductivity and liquid crystals @xcite . however , in this last situation the @xmath4-expansion , which works very well in the non - gauged version , seems to be insufficient to describe unambiguously the critical properties of the model @xcite . only in the large @xmath3 limit",
    "the @xmath4-expansion gives consistent results @xcite .",
    "the trouble is the absence of a second order ( infrared stable ) fixed point in the flow diagram .",
    "this result is physically correct only in the extreme type i regime @xmath5 ( here @xmath6 is the quartic scalar self - coupling and @xmath7 is the charge ) , where we expect a weak first order phase transition .",
    "this regime is also well described by the fluctuation corrected mean field analysis of halperin _ et al .",
    "the weak first order transition has been probed experimentally in certain classes of liquid crystals , where essentially the same gl model holds @xcite . for the extreme type ii region",
    "( @xmath8 ) , a second order fixed point is expected .",
    "indeed , this result follows from numerical studies performed in a lattice dual gl model @xcite .",
    "therefore , the prediction of a first order transition even in the type ii regime seems to be an artifact of the @xmath4-expansion .",
    "more recent works support also this point of view @xcite .",
    "also , it has been shown that the renormalization group ( rg ) in a fixed dimension approach is more appropriate @xcite .",
    "the flow diagram in the @xmath9 plane exhibits in general four fixed points : gaussian and superfluid ( or xy ) , both uncharged , and the tricritical and superconducting which are charged fixed points .",
    "the gaussian fixed point is trivial and describes the mean field critical behavior of a @xmath10 model ( we shall work with @xmath11 ) .",
    "the superfluid fixed point describes the @xmath12-transition in @xmath13 and lies in the same class of universality as the xy model .",
    "the tricritical fixed point is over a line , called tricritical line , which separates the regions of first and second order phase transition .",
    "this fixed point is attractive along the tricritical line but repulsive in the direction nearly parallel to the @xmath6-axis . finally , the superconducting fixed point is a charged infrared stable fixed point and describes a second order superconducting phase transition .",
    "@xcite obtained this flow diagram using wilson s rg @xcite in a non - perturbative version called _ exact renormalization group _ @xcite .",
    "they used the background field formalism to control gauge invariance which is in principle violated due to the presence of the cutoff ( further discussions on this subtle point in wilson s rg can be found in refs.@xcite ) .",
    "this flow diagram has been also obtained by herbut and tesanovic @xcite using a simpler method .",
    "they performed a 1-loop calculation in a fixed dimension approach .    recently",
    "a flow diagram with qualitatively the same structure has been also obtained for a gl model with a topological chern - simons ( cs ) term by malbouisson _",
    "their analysis was performed using wilson s rg in perturbative form , which is not manifestly gauge invariant due to the cutoffed integrals . due to the presence of a cs term , an intrinsically three dimensional object ,",
    "their calculations were performed in @xmath14 and @xmath11 , resulting therefore in an uncontrolled approximation since there is no small parameter as @xmath4 or @xmath15 .",
    "the same type of model has been considered earlier by kleinert and schakel @xcite using a different scaling .",
    "they performed a 1-loop calculation of critical exponents .",
    "however , their scaling did not allows for a consistent zero cs mass limit since feynman graphs were evaluated at zero external momenta .",
    "the reason comes from the graph shown in fig.1 .",
    "when evaluated at zero external momenta this graph gives zero due to the structure of the cs gauge field propagator . on the other hand , in the same scaling",
    "this graph is infrared divergent if no cs mass is included in the action .",
    "thus , it is not legitimate to perform the zero cs mass limit in the scaling considered in @xcite as observed by the authors themselves .",
    "there are many other rg studies of bosonic cs models in the literature but the @xmath16 term is almost always absent @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a term is crucial in order to obtain the flow diagram of ref .",
    "moreover , it is desirable to recover the usual gl model in the limit of zero cs mass .    in this paper",
    "we consider further the topological model of refs .",
    "@xcite , performing the calculation at the critical point @xcite .",
    "we consider two different approximations . in a first step ( section ii )",
    "we perform a 1-loop calculation of the rg functions assuming that the same scale holds for both the order parameter and the gauge field . in this context",
    "we find the following main features : ( 1 ) for the cs coupling smaller than a certain critical value there are no charged fixed points ; ( 2 ) there exists a interval of cs couplings such that two charged fixed points are found , corresponding respectively to the tricritical and second order ( infrared stable ) fixed points . in this interval",
    "it is possible to find respectable values for the @xmath0 exponent but not for the @xmath17 exponent , eventually violating the scaling relations ; ( 3 ) for larger cs coupling , outside the interval mentioned in ( 2 ) , the region of first order behavior is lost since the tricritical fixed point assumes an unphysical value .",
    "the second step ( section iii ) consists in improving upon the 1-loop result of section ii by distinguishing the scales of the order parameter and the gauge field . in this approximation",
    "we follow an idea of herbut and tesanovic in order to relate both scales and obtain in this way the rg flow . in this case",
    "we have the tricritical and second order fixed points even in the limit of zero cs coupling , consistent with the fixed point structure of the conventional gl model .",
    "however , once again the tricritical fixed point becomes unphysical for the cs coupling larger than a certain critical value . in this case",
    "we obtain that all the critical exponents have respectable physical values .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 exponent as a function of the topological coupling does not deviate very much from @xmath1 scaling . finally , in section iv we discuss our results and the possible applications .",
    "our starting point is the following action :    @xmath18+s_{gf},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the subindex @xmath19 denotes bare quantities .",
    "the above action is a standard gl model with a cs term added .",
    "@xmath20 is the gauge fixing term which is given by    @xmath21    with @xmath22 being the bare gauge fixing parameter .",
    "the bare propagator for the gauge field is given by    @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 .",
    "now we write the renormalized action as a sum of @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the same as @xmath27 with the bare quantities replaced by renormalized ones ( in our notation it corresponds to drop the zeroes ) .",
    "@xmath28 is the counterterm part which is given by    @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the renormalized fields are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we shall perform our calculations at the critical point and therefore @xmath32 .",
    "also , we choose @xmath33 in such a way as to cancels the tadpole graphs .",
    "the renormalization conditions for the renormalized vertex functions are given by    @xmath34\\right|_{k^2=p^2}=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\mu},\\\\ \\left.\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k^2}\\left[p_{l}^{ij}(k ) \\gamma^{(2)}_{a , ji}\\right]\\right|_{k^2=p^2}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha},\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k^2}\\left(\\epsilon_{ijk}k_{k}\\gamma^{(2)}_{a , ji}(k ) \\right)\\left.\\right|_{k^2=p^2}&=&-2\\theta,\\\\ \\gamma_{\\psi}^{(4)}(k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},k_{4})|_{s.p.}&=&up,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is a dimensionless coupling and s.p .",
    "denotes the symmetrical point which we take as being given by    @xmath35    @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the transverse and longitudinal projections given respectively by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "note that in the above renormalization conditions the gauge coupling and the scalar coupling are fixed at the same momentum scale .",
    "the renormalized couplings will depend on the momentum scale @xmath40 and the beta functions are defined through derivatives of the couplings with respect to @xmath41 . note that in order to preserve the @xmath10 symmetry of the four point function , we must consider the feynman graphs with all the external momenta incoming at the vertices .",
    "if we proceed otherwise , that is , if we choose a convention which two external lines are incoming while the other two are outcoming , then the corresponding four point function is not symmetric when using the above symmetrical point .",
    "this is easily seen by performing a 1-loop calculation in the uncharged model with @xmath42 symmetry .",
    "the resulting four point function @xmath43 ( the subindices are color indices ) _ is not _",
    "proportional to the @xmath42 symmetric tensor @xmath44 if the graphs are not evaluated with the convention that all the external momenta are incoming .",
    "the ward identies imply the exact relations @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the charge renormalization .",
    "let us define the following dimensionless gauge couplings , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the flow equations are given up to 1-loop order by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the anomalous dimension for the scalar field defined by    @xmath55    while @xmath56 is the anomalous dimension for the gauge field which is defined by    @xmath57    @xmath58 is a function of @xmath59 which will be written later , together with the explicit expressions of the corresponding anomalous dimensions . before doing this , let us discuss some important points concerning the general structure of the above flow equations .",
    "first , we note that @xmath56 does not appear in the flow equations for the couplings @xmath60 , @xmath59 and @xmath6 .",
    "this is because the flow equation for @xmath61 is given up to 1-loop order by    @xmath62    thus , the flow diagram is completely determined by the couplings @xmath60 , @xmath59 and @xmath6 .",
    "this means that we do not need to know the expression of @xmath56 .",
    "another important point concerns the renormalization of @xmath63 .",
    "it is a known fact in topological field theory that the cs mass does not renormalize at all orders in perturbation theory and for the model we are considering it can be verified by explicit calculation up to 2-loops @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which implies eq.([t ] ) .    the most important point concerning the above flow equations is related to the gauge dependence .",
    "it can be shown that the beta function for the gauge couplings are gauge independent in a minimal subtraction scheme @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath54 is gauge dependent .",
    "when @xmath54 is evaluated at the fixed point it gives the @xmath17 exponent .",
    "note that exponents for the superconducting transition should be evaluated at the infrared stable charged fixed point , if we assume that it exists . at the superconducting fixed point",
    "we must have @xmath66 .",
    "this means that the fixed point value of @xmath67 must be @xmath68 , the landau gauge . since at the neighborhood of the superconducting fixed point @xmath67 flows to the landau gauge , critical exponents",
    "are evaluated for @xmath68 and we shall fix it from the very beginning , as is customary in the literature .",
    "the explicit analytical expressions of @xmath54 and @xmath58 are given by    @xmath69,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath70    the function @xmath58 and the anomalous dimension @xmath17 have well defined limits as @xmath71 , which correspond to the limit of the conventional gl model . as @xmath71 ,",
    "we find @xmath72 as @xmath71 while @xmath73 .",
    "the opposite limit , @xmath74 , leads to the expected decoupling of the gauge and scalar degrees of freedom since both @xmath17 and @xmath58 tend to zero in this limit . the @xmath75 term in eq.([u ] ) comes from the graph shown in fig.1 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , this graph is zero when @xmath76 . in the scaling considered in this paper",
    "this graph survives since @xmath77 and we can recover the @xmath71 limit .",
    "the charged fixed points are given by @xmath78 , @xmath79 arbitrary and    @xmath80,\\ ] ]    where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we have that @xmath83 is real only for @xmath84 , which corresponds to the condition for the existence of charged fixed points in our model .",
    "the flow diagram is shown in fig.2 for @xmath85 .",
    "the left charged fixed point , coresponding to @xmath86 , is the so called tricritical fixed point .",
    "the tricritical fixed point is attractive over a line intercepting the origin called the tricritical line .",
    "the tricritical line separates the regions of first and second order phase transitions .",
    "the right charged fixed point , corresponding to @xmath87 , is infrared attractive and describes the physics of second order phase transitions in superconductors .",
    "note also in the flow diagram the gaussian and the @xmath1 fixed points .",
    "another interesting point is that there exists another critical value of @xmath79 , @xmath88 , such that for @xmath89 the tricritical fixed point is in the region of the plane @xmath90 defined by @xmath91 . in this region the tricritical fixed point lost its physical meaning .",
    "it results that the only charged fixed point is the infrared one .",
    "consequently , for @xmath89 only second order behavior seems to be possible .",
    "let us evaluate the critical exponents for the superconducting transition in function of @xmath92 .",
    "it is sufficient to evaluate @xmath17 and @xmath0 since the other exponents are obtained from these ones via scaling relations .",
    "@xmath17 is given simply by evaluating @xmath54 at the fixed point .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath0 , however , is more involved . in the critical theory",
    "this exponent is evaluated by considering a @xmath93 insertion in the two point function .",
    "thus , we must compute the 1-particle irreducible function @xmath94 subjected to the renormalization condition :    @xmath95    which will determine the renormalization constant of @xmath93 , denoted by @xmath96 . as usual @xcite",
    ", the @xmath0 exponent is given by the fixed point value of the rg function @xmath97 defined by    @xmath98    we find :    @xmath99,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath100    at 1-loop order we obtain    @xmath101    the fig.3 shows a plot of the exponent @xmath0 as a function of @xmath79 . note that the plot is made for @xmath102 which corresponds to the region where charged fixed points should exist .",
    "we observe that as @xmath79 increases the value of @xmath0 tends asymptotically to @xmath103 , which corresponds approximately to the xy value for the pure scalar model in the 1-loop approximation at fixed dimension .",
    "this is an expected result since for @xmath74 the gauge modes decouple from the scalar modes .",
    "this result can be verified directly from the above rg functions by expanding for @xmath59 large .    in recent years",
    "it has been stablished that the @xmath0 exponent for the ( non - topological ) superconducting transition is given by @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "thus , we are tempted to search for what value of @xmath79 we have @xmath105 .",
    "one obtains that @xmath106 for @xmath107 . this is smaller than @xmath108 and we have still the region of first order transition in the flow diagram .",
    "unfortunately , a pathological behavior arises for this value of @xmath79 .",
    "the trouble comes from the @xmath17 exponent .",
    "indeed , we have that @xmath109 while we know from the scaling relations that the condition @xmath110 must be fulfilled .",
    "this result is probably an artifact of our 1-loop perturbation theory .",
    "another related problem is that the above results fail in describing a flow diagram with charged fixed points in the limit @xmath71 . in this limit",
    "our flow diagram resembles to that one obtained by halperin _",
    "_ in the seventies @xcite and , as mentioned in the introduction , their result is an artifact of the @xmath4-expansion .",
    "therefore , we should improve our perturbation theory in order to bypass all these difficulties .",
    "as we have said in the last section , the beta functions for the topological gl model have a well defined @xmath71 limit .",
    "however , we have seen that in this limit no charged fixed points exist .",
    "moreover , the @xmath17 exponent could attain unphysical values which violate the scaling relations .",
    "the trouble is that there are in fact two fundamental lenght scales in this problem , namely , the correlation lenght @xmath111 and the magnetic field penetration depth , @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath111 is related to the scaling of the scalar field while @xmath12 is related to the scaling of the gauge field .",
    "thus , in principle , the renormalization conditions for the gauge coupling should be fixed at a different point of the scalar coupling .",
    "since there is a relation between the lenghts @xmath111 and @xmath12 , we must have also a relation between the corresponding renormalization points .",
    "we develop this more general point of view by using a simple method suggested recently by herbut and tesanovic @xcite .",
    "it consists in fixing the renormalization condition eq.(6 ) at the point given by @xmath112 , @xmath113 giving in this way the ratio between the two scales of the problem .",
    "if we use the same reasoning here we obtain the following beta functions in the @xmath71 limit :    @xmath114    where @xmath115 .",
    "note that we have not exactly the same beta functions as in ref .",
    "this is due to the fact that we used the convention that all external momenta are incoming at the vertices .",
    "our choice is more usual in the field theoretical literature and has the advantage that corresponding crossed graphs have the same value at the symmetrical point .",
    "however , these differences in the conventions does not change appreciably the physical results like the values of the critical exponents .",
    "the value of @xmath113 can be fixed by demanding that , if charged fixed points do exist , it should happen at the same critical scale . at 1-loop",
    "this is equivalent to demanding that the ginzburg parameter @xmath116 should be invariant along the rg trajectory connecting the origin and the tricritical fixed point @xcite .",
    "we choose the tricritical fixed point because there are good numerical estimates of @xmath117 available @xcite .",
    "if @xmath118 denotes the value of @xmath117 at the tricritical fixed point we obtain that c is determined by the following equation :    @xmath119    we take @xmath120 which is the value obtained from montecarlo calculations @xcite .",
    "thus , eq.([c ] ) gives @xmath121 .",
    "for this value of @xmath113 we have the flow diagram shown in fig.4 for the non - topological model .",
    "5 shows the detail of the region near the tricritical line which is not well seen in fig .",
    "the rg function @xmath97 in the @xmath71 limit is given by    @xmath122\\ ] ]    we have the following result for the critical exponents :    @xmath123    a result in good agreement with the expected @xmath1 behavior . in ref .",
    "@xcite the value @xmath124 was obtained by using a @xmath113 corresponding to @xmath125 which is determined from the lattice dual model @xcite .",
    "however , they obtained @xmath126 for @xmath127 .",
    "it is possible to improve this value obtained in ref.@xcite by using directly eq.([nu ] ) without expanding it , to obtain the better value @xmath106 , in close agreement with our result @xcite .",
    "this @xmath1 value has also be obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention that non - perturbative rg calculations by bergerhoff _",
    "@xcite gives @xmath124 in a certain approximation corresponding to a truncation of the average action ( the legendre transform of the wilsonian effective action ) at @xmath128 .",
    "truncation at @xmath129 gives the improved result @xmath130 .",
    "let us come back now to the case of non - vanishing @xmath59 .",
    "since the @xmath59 coupling is associated to the gauge degrees of freedom its momentum scale should be rescaled by @xmath113 .",
    "thus , in addition to eqs.([u ] ) and ( [ ff ] ) we have    @xmath131    we keep the same value of @xmath113 in order to preserve the features of the @xmath71 limit .",
    "now we have charged fixed points even when @xmath132 and therefore there is no @xmath133 . on the other hand , we have still @xmath134 .",
    "we verified that @xmath108 is the same as before , that is , @xmath88 .",
    "this means that for @xmath135 we have only second order behavior . in fig .",
    "6 we show the flow diagram for @xmath85 with the detail of the tricritical region shown in fig . 7 . in fig .",
    "8 we plot the exponent @xmath0 as a function of @xmath79 in the improved 1-loop calculation .",
    "note that the shape of the plot is qualitatively the same as in fig.3 .",
    "the main difference is that the vertical scale is compressed and the most remarkable feature is the fact that @xmath0 is now much less sensible to the value of @xmath79 , showing only a small deviation from the @xmath1 scaling .",
    "for instance , the exponents @xmath0 and @xmath17 for @xmath85 are given by    @xmath136    of course , we have still the same @xmath74 limit with exponents @xmath137 and @xmath138 , corresponding to the decoupled situation .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to initiate a careful study of a topological gl model from the point of view of critical phenomena . for this reason we have concentrated the efforts on the rg flow and the evaluation of critical exponents .",
    "the results show that the topological coupling is a good control parameter with respect to the fixed point structure .",
    "for instance , we have seen that the region of first order transition is crunched as the topological coupling is increased and eventually the type i behavior is lost .",
    "an interesting point is that the @xmath0 exponent does not fluctuate very much around the @xmath1 value .    besides superconductivity",
    ", the topological gl model may be useful in other physical contexts .",
    "for example , it can be applied in the study of soft materials like the chiral liquid crystals @xcite . in this case the gauge field should be thought as a director field and the cs term is used in order to introduce the chirality for the constituting molecules .",
    "another interesting problem is the physics of the chiral spin state .",
    "this state arises when one considers the hamiltonian for the heisenberg antiferromagnet whose spins interact not only through nearest neighbors interaction , but also through a next - nearest neighbor one @xcite .",
    "the next - nearest neighbor interaction frustrate the nel state and generates a mean field solution corresponding to a disordered spin state .",
    "the most stable configuration corresponds to the so called chiral spin state .",
    "the continuum effective theory is obtained by computing the fluctuations around such a mean field ground state and it contains a dynamically generated gauge field .",
    "the gauge sector of the effective action is identical to that one of the topological gl model . in this case",
    "the gauge couplings are given in terms of mean field parameters of the original model ( for details see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "finally , we hope that this work will contribute to improve the understanding of gl models .",
