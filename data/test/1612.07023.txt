    "modular values appearing in quantum - gate type interactions @xcite are the counterparts of weak values for unitary operators .",

    "we demonstrate how the quantum three - box paradox with a particle that seems to be in two boxes at the same time , can be equivalent to alice and bob s measurement experiment involving classical particles that seem to be entangled in two non - classical ways at the same time .",

    "we will show that each couple with the corresponding normalization factor determines one of the three symmetric two - level states , @xmath214 , @xmath216 and @xmath215 of bob s measurement basis .",

    "the angle between the vectors of each pair is equivalent , but different from @xmath8 , and symmetric with respect to the @xmath241-axis .",
    "consequently , the structure formed on the bloch sphere by the measurement basis of the three - box experiment corresponds to the symmetry group @xmath242 .",
    "this symmetry allows to introduce the local rotation operation @xmath243 under which the three - box basis is left invariant . by considering the pre- and postselected vectors on the bloch sphere , we deduce additionally that the final postselected state is the mirror image of the initial preselected state with respect to @xmath241-axis , and vice versa , with @xmath244 .",
