    "the almost undisrupted flow of data potentially useful for cosmological model selection and parameter fitting provides day by day a clearer picture of the evolution of the universe , which according to a wide consensus seems to be currently accelerating .",
    "yet it is uncertain how strong the conclusions of these sorts of investigation are , as there are not only statistical uncertainties to worry about , but possible theoretical biasing in the tests used .",
    "this being the situation , the community is eager to be able to devise new tests and/or improve the understanding of the shortcomings of the existing ones towards refining them .",
    "the underlying hope is that , at least from a phenomenological perspective , cosmologists will eventually be able to tell with high precision how fast the universe is expanding at present , how long this speed up has lasted , and how the acceleration rate has changed over the recent past .",
    "recently simon et al .",
    "@xcite have published hubble function @xmath0 data extracted from differential ages of passively evolving galaxies .",
    "the use of these data to constrain the background evolution of the universe is interesting for several reasons .",
    "first , it can be used together with other cosmological tests in order to get useful consistency checks or tighter constraints on models .",
    "second , in contrast to standard candle luminosity distances or standard ruler angular diameter distances , the hubble function is not integrated over .",
    "this will allow , mostly in the future , when the systematic errors associated with the cluster physics have been reduced , to get cleaner constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "the same data have also been recently used in @xcite to constrain several cosmological models . in this paper",
    "we use them in combination with the latest sne ia set compiled by davis et al . @xcite and the cmb shift parameter as calculated by wang and mukherjee @xcite from wmap 3 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other works , we have chosen not to use the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) data because , as pointed out in @xcite , there is a level of uncertainty in the use of the measure @xmath1 given in @xcite to test non - lcdm models .",
    "we have chosen to put constraints on 6 different cosmological models that show late - time acceleration ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for all of them we have assumed flat space , consistent with the inflationary prediction that the curvature density parameter @xmath2 @xcite and with the results obtained by cmb experiments @xcite .",
    "three of the models are dark energy models while in the remaining three models the acceleration arises from or is modified by a five - dimensional modification of gravity motivated by extra dimensional physics .",
    "one also can group these models by pairs according to the number of parameters apart from @xmath3 .",
    "lcdm and dgp @xcite have only one parameter , i.e. the matter density parameter .",
    "qcdm , i.e. dark energy parametrized as a perfect fluid with a constant equation of state , and ldgp , a non self - accelerating solution for the dgp action @xcite , add to the matter density one further parameter : the equation of state and the crossover scale ( i.e. the scale at which the 5-dimensional behaviour becomes effective ) , respectively .",
    "the last two models chosen are the chevalier - polarski - linder parametrization @xcite ( which contains two parameters characterizing the evolution of the equation of state ) and the qdgp model @xcite , a phenomenological extension of the ldgp model , where the cosmological constant is replaced by a dark energy fluid with a constant equation of state .",
    "similar analyses of a subset of these models using recent datasets partially overlapping with ours have been done in @xcite and our work may be complementary to that .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ models ] we outline the models to be investigated and the corresponding forms of @xmath0 .",
    "then , in sec",
    ". [ obs ] we give details of the three datasets considered , and we explain how they can be used to constrain the background of cosmological models .",
    "after that , in sec .",
    "[ estsec ] we review the concepts and techniques we resort to in our statistical analysis of the data .",
    "finally , we present our results and conclusions in sec .",
    "[ rescon ] ( accompanied by some additional statistical information and considerations about the effective equations of state in the different models in the appendices ) .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite , extracting information about the properties of dark energy from a reconstruction of @xmath0 is not in principle problematic from the mathematical perspective , but it is hard in practice because one only has at hand a discrete set of noisy data ( for several redshifts ) from which one wishes to infer information valid for all redshift values within a given interval . the various approaches to confronting models with data are based on deriving the luminosity distance @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite or @xmath0 @xcite .    here we will use the second approach and compare to observations six cosmological models altogether : the models can be grouped in pairs according to the number of parameters ( one , two or three ) ; in addition each pair will contain one general relativistic dark energy model and one model inspired by extradimensional modifications to gravity .      in general , if we consider a general relativistic model of dark energy with an equation of state that depends on the redshift , @xmath5 , the expression for @xmath6 obeys @xmath7,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where one assumes that in addition to dark energy the universe contains dust ( dark matter and baryons ) .",
    "the lcdm model corresponds to the choice @xmath8 , i.e. dark energy is a cosmological constant @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath10 and the free parameter of the model is @xmath11 .",
    "lcdm is consistent with all data , but there is a theoretical problem in explaining the observed value of @xmath9 .",
    "the dark gravity model inspired by the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneoworld model @xcite was given by deffayet @xcite , and it represents a simple alternative to the standard lcdm cosmology , with the same number of parameters .    in this model the late universe self - accelerates , not because of dark energy , which is absent , but rather due to an infrared modification of gravity .",
    "explicitly one has @xmath12    one can define an effective dark energy equation of state @xmath13 by imposing @xmath14 along with @xmath15 to obtain , implicitly @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and explicitly @xmath18 for this scenario one can see that @xmath19 , so the final asymptotic state is a de sitter model .",
    "this model arises from the simplest generalization of lcdm , which consists in taking a constant value of @xmath20 different , in general , from @xmath21 , so one gets @xmath22 despite its simplicity , this model can prove useful , as a preference for this parametrization over the lcdm case will provide support for the evolutionary nature of dark energy .",
    "this model represents the non self - accelerating branch of dgp ( the two separate branches of dgp arise from the two possible ways to embed the 4d brane universe in the 5d spacetime ; see also @xcite for further explanation ) . to generate acceleration a cosmological constant",
    "is needed .",
    "there are two main features of this model .",
    "one is the screening effect on @xmath9 due to the presence of the extra dimension , that allows for a higher value of the cosmological constant .",
    "the other is the possibility of having effective phantom behaviour without any phantom field and any of the associated instabilities .",
    "in addition , this model does not have ghosts , unlike the self - accelerating dgp .",
    "the evolution of the model is governed by the relation @xmath23 where on the one hand @xmath24 for the requirement of flatness ( see @xcite ) , and on the other hand the parameter @xmath25 is related to the crossover scale which signals the transition from the general relativistic to the modified gravity regime ( see again @xcite for details ) .",
    "observational constraints on this particular model using sn , cmb shift and bao data were studied in @xcite , where it was found that statistically the best fit corresponded to the lcdm limit of the model .",
    "the same procedure to obtain @xmath13 that we mentioned in the dgp model applies here , so one will have , from eq .",
    "( [ weff ] ) , @xmath26[\\sqrt{\\omega_{r_c}}+e(z)]}.\\ ] ]      this is a widely used ansatz , which generalizes qcdm to allow for evolution in the dark energy equation of state , as required by most realistic scalar field models .",
    "( it was first discussed in @xcite , and reintroduced independently in @xcite . )",
    "explicitly it corresponds to @xmath27 and therefore    @xmath28    among its desirable features two stand out : first , this parametrization of dark energy remains finite at large redshifts , and second , the physical interpretation of the model is simple as the parameter @xmath29 is a measure of the scalar field potential slow roll factor @xmath30 in the case of quintessence @xcite .",
    "this model , introduced in @xcite , is a generalization of ldgp where the cosmological constant is replaced by dark energy with a constant equation of state @xmath31 , in general different from @xmath21 , that represents a new parameter of the model .",
    "the modified 4d friedman equation has the following form : @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "clearly , in this case too one can make use of eq .",
    "( [ weff ] ) to derive @xmath13 : @xmath34[\\omega_w ( z)-2e(z)\\sqrt{\\omega_{r_c}}]}.\\ ] ]",
    "the hubble parameter depends on the differential age of the universe in terms of redshift , specifically @xmath35 thus , measuring @xmath36 allows us to determine @xmath0 .",
    "as described first in @xcite and in @xcite , it is possible to use absolute ages of passively evolving galaxies to compute values of @xmath36 .",
    "the galaxy spectral data used by @xcite come from the gemini deep deep survey @xcite and archival data @xcite . in broad terms , the authors of these references bin together galaxies with a redshift separation which is small enough so that the galaxies in the bin have roughly the same age ; then , they calculate age differences between bins which have a small age difference which is at the same time larger than the error in the age itself @xcite .",
    "the outcome of this process is a set of 9 values of the hubble parameter versus redshift ( see table [ tab h ] ) .",
    "a particularly nice feature of this test is that differential ages are less sensitive to systematic errors than absolute ages @xcite .",
    ".h(z ) data from @xcite ( in units of @xmath37 ) [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ odds ]    in this paper we have performed parameter estimation and model selection for a set of flat frw cosmological models which could be suitable to explain the observed current acceleration .",
    "half of the models stem from the assumption of a dark energy component in the universe , whereas the other half is made by models motivated by extra dimensions and that include a gravitational component of the observed expansion acceleration .",
    "we analyze data coming from ( most recent ) snia luminosity , cmb shift and @xmath0 measurements . even though most of our statistical treatment fits into the bayesian approach , for completeness we also report results on some frequentist estimators .",
    "our results are consistent with partially overlapping work ( e.g. @xcite ) done previously using different combinations of observations .",
    "one may think a priori the dominant source of error to be the @xmath0 data , as the percentage errors range from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , whereas for the sn data the lowest percentage error is @xmath40 and the highest is @xmath41 on the one hand , and for the cmb shift single datum we have a percentage error of @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the @xmath43 construction from the @xmath0 data does not involve any integration , there might be a restraint in the propagation of errors coming from them .",
    "we are inclined to think this is actually the case as the size of errors in our study are comparable with those obtained in other works .    in the light of our results",
    "we conclude , first of all , that the frequentist estimator @xmath44 significantly disfavours the dgp model over all the other models considered .",
    "we compute the probability of getting values of the @xmath43 not farther from the minimum than the minimum @xmath43 for all other models , as defined in @xcite and we get a probability @xmath45 .",
    "consistently we arrive at the same conclusion using bayes evidence . on the other hand ,",
    "if we compare lcdm with all the other models , it turns out that from the frequentist perspective it is as good as qcdm , whereas for ldgp , cpl and qdgp one gets exactly the same value @xmath44 , a value which turns out to be just slightly larger than the one for lcdm . in conclusion , the frequentist analysis yields the result that lcdm is just marginally preferred over all the rest of the models , except for dgp which is clearly the least likely model of all six .    regarding the bayesian analysis , the reader can decide whether to qualify our results using the adjectives in jeffrey s scale or just stick to the objectivity of the numbers giving us the odds of the different models against the others , but at least in the case of dgp versus lcdm we dare to say it is difficult not to be carried by the impression that it is rather disfavored .",
    "finally , our results on credible limits point us in the direction that this combination of data sets constrain very poorly models with two `` dark energy '' parameters , so parameter constraints on cpl and qdgp seem not to be tight enough .",

    "in this appendix we present the plots of the probability densities of the six different models considered . as explained above @xmath46 will represent the probability density obtained by marginalization over all the parameters of the model except for the parameter @xmath47 . for the models with more than one parameter we also plot the likelihood contours associated to 68 , 95 and 99@xmath48 probability . for the models with 3 parameters we have fixed @xmath11 to be @xmath49 .",

    "for the sake of illustration , we represent the best fits @xmath5 for the cpl model and @xmath50 for the dgp and ldgp models .",
    "we do not present the plots for the lcdm and qcdm models as the corresponding plots are basically stripes of constant width as they correspond to non - dynamical dark energy . for every best fit we include in the plot an estimation of error propagation based on the assumption of no error correlation . as in our parameter constraints",
    ", we have various sources of complication . on the one hand , as in some models ( cpl , for instance ) we have found slight departures from gaussianity , we can not use the standard error propagation formula , in addition the errors found are large in the case of some parameters also we put forward a modification of the standard formula in order to account for non - gaussianities and large errors . assuming our constraints in a generic cosmological parameter @xmath47",
    "are reported in the form @xmath51 , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 being positive quantities .",
    "we can give an estimate of the error in a quantity @xmath54 derived from various such parameters by taking for the upper error the quantity @xmath55 and for the lower error the quantity @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58    so , we have proposed an estimation of error based on finite differences ; nevertheless , one can be more refined if errors are small , i.e. @xmath59 and @xmath60 , because then one can write @xmath61 and @xmath62      in fig .",
    "( [ wplots ] ) we depict the best fit equation of state parameter along with error stripes for the models with more than one parameter .",
    "a few points are worth mentioning regarding the ldgp and qdgp models so as to clarify the peculiarity of the result .",
    "first of all , one must keep in mind for both cases we have found the best fit to correspond to their lcdm limit , which translates into an exactly constant equation of state parameter . on the other hand , the ldgp may look even stranger , as no upper error stripe appears in its plot .",
    "the reason for this is well grounded analytically , as the ldgp model does not have the ability to cross the phantom divide @xcite , so @xmath13 can not be error - propagated across that barrier .",
    "our plot just gives a graphical account of that analytical imposibility .",

    "<S> recently @xmath0 data obtained from differential ages of galaxies have been proposed as a new geometrical probe of dark energy . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we use those data , combined with other background tests ( cmb shift and snia data ) , to constrain a set of general relativistic dark energy models together with some other models motivated by extra dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis rests mostly on bayesian statistics , and we conclude that lcdm is at least substantially favoured , and that extradimensional models are less favoured than general relativistic ones . </S>"
