    "in the present work we investigated the coupling of a quantum system with a gaussian white noise . for a dipole coupling , i.e. proportional to the position of the quantum system , the noise can be integrated explicitly using functional methods . in this way",
    ", one avoids the time consuming construction of statistical significant ensembles to follow the evolution of the wave function .",
    "the integration over the gaussian white noise introduces a new average which can be performed before or after the integration over the dynamical variables .",
    "then , for any correlation function @xmath140 the integration over the random field can be perform either after computing @xmath141 for a given realisation of the @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath142 where @xmath143 stands for the expectation value @xmath144 for a given @xmath4 field , or perform first the integration over the random fields and define an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian to compute @xmath145 in terms of @xmath22 .",
    "the interplay between the two different kinds of averages allow to describe the fluctuation - dissipation characteristics that are typically associated with a complex quantum system .    for the latter type of averages",
    ", the integration replaces the original hamiltonian by a new non - hermitian effective hamiltonian @xmath22 .",
    "as argued before and shown explicitly for the noisy quantum oscillator , the dynamics associated to @xmath22 is dissipative and localised , i.e. @xmath2 vanishes for sufficient large times or for sufficient large @xmath146 .",
    "this exponential damping in time and space is a general property associated with the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath22 .",
    "for example in  @xcite , by solving an equivalent stochastic schrdinger equation , the authors observed an exponential decay in the long time behaviour of the spin correlation functions .",
    "although we have considered a particular type of coupling between a quantum system and the gaussian white noise , the procedure can be generalised beyond the dipole coupling .",
    "for example , for @xmath147 , where @xmath148 represents a general operator , the integration considered here generates the following effective hamiltonian @xmath149 .",
    "this class of hamiltonian includes , for example , the case of the nonlinear schrdinger equation subject to random noise used to describe the evolution of bose - einstein condensates , i.e. the gross  pitaevskii equation , to investigate nonlinear photonics , langmuir waves in plasmas among other systems  see e.g.  @xcite and references there in .",
    "furthermore , besides the linear coupling in @xmath1 , the functional integration can also be performed exactly up to quadratic terms @xmath150 , where @xmath151 and @xmath152 represent possible quantum operators . in this case",
    ", the new effective hamiltonian reads @xmath153 .    as a final remark , we would like to show that the above procedure can be extended to include many - body interactions in a particle independent approach to a system of identical particles . for",
    "a system of identical particles one should consider a single white noise which should be coupled to @xmath154 .",
    "the total hamiltonian reads @xmath155 where @xmath54 is the hamiltonian for the many - particle system with zero noise .",
    "it follows that the new effective hamiltonian is given by @xmath156 with the new non - hermitian interaction being proportional to the square of the position of the center of mass of the identical particle system .",
    "this non - hermitian operator is responsible for the damping in time of the many - body system and also by its localisation in space .",
    "the non - hermitian interaction , namely the dissipative force , drives the many - particle system to collapse to its center of mass position for sufficiently large times , however the contribution from the fluctuation has to be accounted , and it will soften this sharp behaviour with a gain contribution as opposed to the losses from dissipation .    in summary , we propose a general method to describe the dynamics of quantum systems coupled to a gaussian white noise and that takes into account the dissipative and fluctuations aspects of a noisy quantum system . the dissipative aspect of the quantum evolution can be found by integrating directly the random fields in the definition of the partition function of the theory .",
    "this procedure establishes a mapping between quantum systems driven by white noise and non - hermitian dissipative hamiltonians , associated with losses , namely probability flows from the explicit degrees of freedom to the implicit ones simulated by the noisy field .",
    "the exact integration and the use of @xmath22 avoid the statistical sampling to compute the evolution of the amplitude of the quantum state . on the other hand ,",
    "the contributions from the fluctuations can be accessed by computing the time evolution of the density matrix and averaging over the stochastic field after .",
    "that gives two terms to the density evolution : one follows from the non - hermitian hamiltonian dynamics with dissipation and corresponding losses and another one associated with a gain contribution from the fluctuations induced by the coupling of the quantum system to the white noise .",
    "the method was formulated in configuration space but , in principle , it can be translated into any other representation or applied to spin systems as those used in quantum computing .    for a dipole coupling to the white noise ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian is the complex frequency harmonic oscillator , with an analytical evolution operator .",
    "it leads to space and time localisation , a common feature of noisy quantum systems . in this case",
    ", the current reproduces the same pattern as observed when one uses stochastic methods  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the complex frequency naturally gives a width to the oscillator states which become resonant states .",
    "the effective quantum hamiltonian @xmath22 can be used to describe several many - body physical phenomena , such as stochastic resonances and bose - einstein condensation , and , in particular , the complex frequency harmonic oscillator can provide the starting point for a more general approach to the dynamics of such type of systems under the stochastic dipole interaction .",
    "so far only the losses are accounted explicitly by our example . to complete the picture the gain contribution to the density matrix",
    "should be computed , that task is beyond the present work and we leave it for a future investigation .",
