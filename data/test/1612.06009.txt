    "in general relativity , the vaidya solution @xcite is a nonstatic generalization of the schwarzschild geometry and has some unique features .",
    "it describes the geometry of unpolarized radiation , represented by a null fluid emerging from a spherically symmetric source @xcite .",
    "therefore , the vaidya metric may model back - reaction effects for evaporating black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "glass and krisch @xcite extended the vaidya geometry to include both a radiation fluid and a string fluid ( see also @xcite by same authors ) by allowing the mass to be a function of both retarded time and distance along the outgoing null geodesics .",
    "the collapse of the null fluid described by the vaidya solution in the flat minkowski space has been studied by dadhich and ghosh @xcite .",
    "they first obtained the analogue of the vaidya line - element on the brane for studying the collapse of the null fluid in a flat minkowski cavity on the brane , the back reaction of the bulk on the brane , favouring formation of a bh against naked singularity ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the end state of collapse of the null radiation with a string fluid was considered by govinder and govender @xcite .",
    "they also investigated the collapse of ricci - flat metrics and showed that the presence of a string fluid could lead to the appearance of locally naked singularity for null fluids .",
    "mcclure et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed cosmological versions of vaidya s radiating stellar exterior .",
    "they found a two - fluid solution that consists of a null fluid and an imperfect fluid which contains an inhomogeneous dark energy ( de ) component with negative energy density for the spacetimes of an accelerating cosmological reference frame .",
    "baccetti et al .",
    "@xcite assumed an early onset of bh evaporation and investigated its consequences for the simple system of a collapsing uniform thin shell , with an outgoing vaidya metric outside @xcite and minkowski metric inside .",
    "they obtained the equation of motion of the collapsing shell by means of the junction conditions on metric and the extrinsic curvature .",
    "the bh evaporation in conformal gravity was studied by bambi et al . @xcite .",
    "since massless particles are naturally conformally invariant , the simplest model of gravitational collapse in conformal gravity is given by the collapse of a thin shell of radiation with vaidya s space outside the shell and conformally - flat inside .",
    "they chose the radiation stress tensor to be that of a null dust ( see @xcite , where the authors generalized the vaidya solution in de rham - gabadadze - tolley massive gravity .",
    "our motivation in this paper is too look for a null fluid with nonzero radial pressure as the source of the vaidya geometry .",
    "sec.2 introduces the imperfect fluid stress tensor and studies its structure and the kinematical properties of a timelike congruence of observers . in sec.3",
    "one calculates the total energy flow through a @xmath6 surface and its relation with the brown - york energy @xmath7 .",
    "a modified regular form of the vaidya metric is introduced in sec.4 and its properties are investigated .",
    "the modified quasilocal energy @xmath7 is analyzed in sec.5 , both as a function of @xmath4 and as a function of mass @xmath8 of the object , a celestial body or a bh .",
    "we conclude with some general remarks in sec.6 .    throughout the paper we use geometrical units @xmath9 , unless otherwise specified .",
    "vaidya @xcite solved einstein s equations for a spherically - symmetric radiative body with the stress tensor of radiation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a null vector directed radially and @xmath2 is defined as the energy density of radiation measured locally by an observer with 4-velocity field @xmath12 , so that @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the line - element can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is schwarzschild time coordinate , @xmath17 is the tortoise coordinate and @xmath18 is the advanced ingoing time coordinate .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is the mass of the radiating spherically - symmetric object and @xmath19 stands for the metric of the unit two - sphere .",
    "we consider only the region @xmath20 for ( 2.1 ) , to avoid the signature flip at the horizon .",
    "it is valid for both ordinary celestial objects and for bhs .",
    "the geometry ( 2.1 ) is generated by the energy - momentum tensor given above , with only one nonzero component @xmath21 and zero trace , where @xmath22 .",
    "in other words , it corresponds to a null fluid with no pressures , i.e. , a null dust .",
    "that interpretation originates from the fact that the tensor @xmath23 resembles the stress tensor for a perfect fluid @xmath24 when @xmath25 .",
    "we remind that li et al .",
    "@xcite have not specified what is the 4-velocity @xmath12 , namely , what are its components .",
    "we consider now a different interpretation of the source of the vaidya metric and take the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to an imperfect fluid with energy flux @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the radial pressure , @xmath28 are the transversal ( tangential ) pressures , @xmath29 is the energy flux 4-vector and @xmath30 is a unit spacelike vector orthogonal to @xmath12 .",
    "we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we look now for the expression of the quantities @xmath33 for ( 2.2 ) and ( 2.3 ) to represent the same stress tensor .",
    "let us take a velocity vector field of the form ( for simplicity we replaced @xmath5 with @xmath8 ) @xmath34 i.e. an observer sitting at @xmath6 from ( 2.5 ) and the properties of @xmath30 , we find that @xmath35 as we previously specified , the mixed stress tensor which generates ( 2.1 ) has only one nonzero component : @xmath21 .",
    "defining , as obvious , the energy density of the null fluid as @xmath36 , it is an easy task to obtain @xmath37 where @xmath38 has been used . keeping in mind that @xmath39 , the expression for @xmath28 results immediately from ( 2.4 ) : @xmath40 , so that the fluid has no tangential pressures .",
    "the trace of ( 2.4 ) yields @xmath41 whence @xmath42 .",
    "hence , the null fluid has a nonzero radial pressure .",
    "from here we find that the isotropic pressure is @xmath43 , as for incoherent radiation .",
    "the current is obtained from ( 2.4 ) as @xmath44 which gives us @xmath45 and @xmath46 , as it should be for a null fluid .",
    "having now the physical parameters entering ( 2.4 ) , we may compare @xmath47 from ( 2.4 ) with that from ( 2.2 ) , to obtain @xmath48 whence @xmath49 with the help of @xmath50 from ( 2.5 ) , we get the components of the acceleration 4-vector of the congruence @xmath51 the proper acceleration reads @xmath52 and the scalar expansion is given by @xmath53 let us discuss briefly the energy conditions fulfilled by the stress tensor ( 2.4 ) .",
    "we consider our source of the vaidya solution is better than the standard one , where the radial pressure does not appear .",
    "it is hidden by the null vector @xmath54 which in our interpretation is a difference between a timelike vector @xmath12 and a spacelike vector @xmath30 , orthogonal to @xmath12 . the standard interpretation as a null dust",
    "is introduced by a formal analogy with a perfect fluid with no pressures .",
    "we conjectured a general expression ( 2.4 ) of the source and imposed it to be traceless and to have one nonzero component only , i.e. @xmath55 , for to be in accordance with the standard solution .",
    "we have used the choice @xmath20 , otherwise @xmath18 becomes a spacelike coordinate .    with @xmath3 ( we are working with ingoing radiation ) , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 is obtained when @xmath58 , namely in the static situation ) . in other words ,",
    "the wec is obeyed .",
    "same is valid for the other energy conditions : nec , sec and dec .",
    "being null , the fluid observes the condition @xmath59 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath2 is divergent at the origin and at the evolutionary hypersurface @xmath60 ( the apparent horizon ) , because of the nonstatic character of the spacetime . , where @xmath61 is the areal radius .",
    "one obtains @xmath62 , or @xmath60 we could have also used the method from @xcite ( the vanishing of the scalar expansion on the null vector field along null geodesics ) .",
    "] we shall see later how the divergence at @xmath63 could be removed .",
    "the currents @xmath64 and @xmath65 from ( 2.10 ) are inward directed because @xmath3 and are also divergent on the horizon .",
    "as far as the acceleration of the congruence is concerned , we notice that the invariant acceleration from ( 2.14 ) becomes the standard schwarzschild counterpart when @xmath58 .",
    "having now the components of the stress tensor and the basic physical quantities associated to it , our next task is to compute the total energy flow measured by an observer laying at @xmath6 @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are given by ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) , respectively . to find @xmath69 we remove the @xmath4-line and @xmath4- column in @xmath70 and obtain @xmath71 . with @xmath21 , eq .",
    "( 3.1 ) yields @xmath72 where @xmath4 is fixed and @xmath8 is the variable of integration .",
    "one obtains @xmath73 with @xmath74 a constant of integration ( w.r.t .",
    "@xmath8 ) .",
    "it may be determined by imposing that @xmath75 when @xmath8 vanishes , so that @xmath76 .",
    "hence @xmath77 a plot of @xmath78 versus @xmath8 , at constant @xmath4 , is depicted in fig.1 .",
    "one notes that the derivative @xmath79 diverges at @xmath80 .",
    "( 3.4 ) , taken as a function of @xmath4 , resembles the quasilocal energy ( qle ) for a schwarzschild bh @xcite .",
    "an observation is in order here : lundgren et al .",
    "plotted @xmath81 even for @xmath82 .",
    "however , we have to keep in mind that @xmath4 becomes timelike in that region and to cover both regions ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) in the same plot seems to be inappropriate .    due to the square root from ( 3.4 ) , the derivative @xmath79 is infinite at the horizon , which is like the infinite value of @xmath84 from the lundgren et al .",
    "we also observe that the derivation of the qle @xmath85 by the authors of @xcite remains valid even when the mass of the object is time - dependent , as in our situation , because the expressions of the connection coefficients that we need are @xcite @xmath86 as in the static case .",
    "therefore , the extrinsic curvature of the two - boundary preserves its value .",
    "it is clear from ( 2.1 ) that we must impose @xmath87 since at @xmath60 a signature flip takes place and @xmath18 becomes a spacelike coordinate . in addition , being nonstatic , the metric ( 2.1 ) has no a timelike killing vector and so an event horizon can not be obtained . in that case",
    "an apparent horizon is more appropriate . to extend the metric ( 2.1 ) beyond the evolutionary surface @xmath60 we introduce an exponential factor in the metric , rendering the stress tensor regular at the origin",
    "therefore , we propose the geometry @xmath88 with @xmath89",
    ". the above line - element may be obtained by a similar manner as that for ( 2.1 ) .",
    "we begin with the regularized schwarzschild spacetime @xcite @xmath90 and move to the eddington - finkelstein coordinates with @xmath91 that will give @xmath92 the above recipe works also when @xmath93 , even though @xmath94 can not be obtained explicitely as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
    "we showed in @xcite that , for @xmath95 from ( 4.1 ) is nonnegative for any @xmath96 and vanishes at @xmath97 .",
    "we check now the positivity of @xmath98 for any @xmath99 , with @xmath6 .",
    "we have @xmath100 which is vanishing at @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , @xmath103 is nonnegative for any positive @xmath8 . a plot of @xmath103 against @xmath8 , for constant @xmath4 is given in fig.2 in addition , @xmath103 tends to unity at @xmath104 and when @xmath105 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath103 on @xmath8 is similar with that of @xmath106 at constant @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath107 , for any @xmath4 and @xmath8 .    as far as the components of @xmath12 and @xmath30 in the geometry ( 4.1 ) is concerned , they will have the same structure as those from ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) , excepting the square root which is @xmath108 .",
    "we obtain now the following expressions for @xmath2 and @xmath27 , using same arguments as those from sec.2 @xmath109 and @xmath110 the transversal pressures are @xmath111 which does not depend on @xmath112 .",
    "the energy flux 4-vector has the nonzero components @xmath113 with @xmath114 one observes that the trace @xmath115 is always negative .",
    "therefore , we have no longer a null fluid but an anisotropic fluid with energy flux .",
    "in the static case ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath2 and @xmath27 acquire the corresponding values from @xcite , which are regular in the whole spacetime .",
    "compared to ( 2.7 ) , they are vanishing at the origin .",
    "the conclusion is that the exponential factor from the line - element ( 4.1 ) renders @xmath2 and @xmath27 finite only at the origin of coordinates , but not at the apparent horizon @xmath116 , due to the variable mass @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the nonstatic character of the metric ( 4.1 ) leads to a nonvanishing scalar expansion of the congruence @xmath117 which diverges at @xmath116 , is negative for @xmath118 , positive for @xmath119 and vanishes when @xmath120 .",
    "to find the expression of the total energy @xmath7 crossing a surface of constant @xmath4 , we follow up the same prescription from the beginning of sec.3 . we obtain now @xmath121 and",
    "@xmath122 therefore @xmath123 which gives us @xmath124 we get finally @xmath125 where the same boundary conditions have been applied , as per ( 3.4 ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath78 seems to have the same mathematical structure as that from ( 3.4 ) , though the integrands were very different .",
    "that gives us the opportunity to consider the same physical meaning as in sec.3 : @xmath78 represents the brown - york energy enclosed by a @xmath6 hypersurface .",
    "let us first study the behaviour of @xmath7 from ( 5.5 ) w.r.t .",
    "@xmath4 , taking @xmath126 we observe that @xmath127 when @xmath128 , as expected , and is vanishing at @xmath63 .",
    "we might , of course , calculate @xmath81 directly , following the recipe from @xcite @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 is the induced metric on the two boundary @xmath132 .",
    "@xmath133 in ( 5.6 ) is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of @xmath132 and @xmath134 corresponds to the vacuum ( i.e. , when @xmath104 ) .",
    "but the connection coefficients ( 3.5 ) are also valid for the spacetime ( 4.1 ) so that the expression ( 5.5 ) emerges .    a more detailed investigation of the function @xmath81 needs the derivative @xmath135 .",
    "we look now for the extremal of @xmath81 , if any . from @xmath136 and after one squaring , we arrive at @xmath137 which is a transcendental equation .",
    "we show that ( 5.8 ) has a unique solution . a new variable @xmath138 yields",
    "@xmath139 one observes that the two curves ( the straight line from the r.h.s . and the exponential ) have the same tangent at @xmath140 where the two functions are equal . in conclusion , @xmath116 is the single solution of ( 5.8 ) .",
    "nevertheless , at @xmath141 is not extremal because the denominator is vanishing there . taking the limit of the derivative when @xmath142 , one obtains the value @xmath143 when @xmath118 and @xmath144 for @xmath119 .",
    "we see that , at the apparent horizon @xmath145 is , however , finite , contrary to its infinite value from@xcite ( see authors comments above their eq.18 ) .",
    "we have also @xmath146 . in fig.3",
    "is depicted the qle in terms of @xmath4 , both inside and outside the horizon .",
    "let us take now a look at the function @xmath78 , at constant @xmath4 , given by ( 5.5 ) .",
    "one notes in passing that @xmath78 is undetermined as we do not have the expression of @xmath5 .",
    "our procedure gives no indication of how to determine it .",
    "as in the previous section , one must solve the equation @xmath147 , to find the extremal values of @xmath78 , if any . from ( 5.5 ) we have @xmath148 therefore , @xmath78 grows from zero at @xmath104 to @xmath4 at @xmath101 in the region @xmath149 and drops from @xmath4 to zero at infinity in the region @xmath150 , for a given @xmath4 .",
    "the derivative ( 5.10 ) is not defined at @xmath101 where both the numerator and denominator vanish .",
    "therefore , we have to compute the side limits at that point , which gives the values @xmath151 for @xmath149 and @xmath152 for @xmath150 .",
    "fig.4 shows the dependence of @xmath78 on @xmath8 . in other words",
    ", @xmath78 is not differentiable at @xmath101 but , nevertheless , both side limits are finite . in addition , there is an inflexion point at @xmath153 .",
    "consequently , @xmath78 is always positive , vanishes at @xmath104 and acquires its maximum value when our observer is located at the horizon .",
    "the properties of the vaidya solution of einstein s equations with a null fluid as source are investigated in this paper .",
    "in contrast with the standard vaidya solution , our fluid has a nonzero radial pressure , equal to the energy density . in our region of interest (",
    "@xmath20),all energy conditions for the stress tensor are satisfied . due to vanishing tangential pressures , the equation of state of the fluid is @xmath0 , in agreement with that of null radiation .",
    "the total energy flow crossing a @xmath154 hypersurface turns out to represent the brown - york quasilocal energy .",
