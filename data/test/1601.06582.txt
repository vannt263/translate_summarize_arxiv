    "liquid crystalline order is ubiquitous in biological materials @xcite and many properties of these systems can be analyzed in terms of the standard landau - de gennes approach @xcite , without particularly worrying about e.g. the polymer nature of the main - chain polymer nematogens .",
    "nevertheless , it was recognized a while ago , that the landau - de gennes approach needs to be modified specifically to take into account the polymer nature , i.e. the microscopic connectivity of the underlying mesogens @xcite .",
    "this connectivity leads to a coupling between the positional and orientational order of the polymer molecules .",
    "the ensuing  continuity equation \" derived to take into account this specificity of the polymer mesophase materials was shown to matter fundamentally for a consistent description of macroscopic properties of these systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , recently we showed that depending on the nature and the symmetry of the mesophase order , this  continuity equation \" might not be the only condition that the coarse grained description of polymer nematics needs to satisfy .",
    "in fact , its generalized form in terms of a vectorial conservation law @xcite suffices for polar nematic order , while in the more usual quadrupolar nematic order case a different , tensorial conservation law has to be included in the landau - de gennes description @xcite .",
    "discovering a new form of the conservation law , stemming from the microscopic connectivity of the constitutive nematogen molecules , naturally leads to questions , such as which form of the conservation law is the correct one , how are they related , when is the use of one preferred to the other one and how important is their implementation for the proper description of polymer nematics . in this note",
    "we address and resolve all these fundamental questions for future applications .",
    "in fact , we show that the two conservation laws are not equivalent , are irreducible and in general lead to different consequences specifically stemming from the presence of the backfolding configurations of the polymer chains , or in an extreme case , to the presence of localized hairpins and/or kinks which should be in particular relevant in the description of confined dna mesophases , where such local defects or elastic energy non - linearities have been implicated recently @xcite .    in what follows , extending our previous analysis @xcite , we thus propose a new , generalized conservation law for the main - chain polymer nematics that _ consistently incorporates _ both the vectorial as well as the tensorial conservation laws . moreover , and in particular , this includes also a well - grounded interpretation of the recently derived tensorial conservation law that has been so far elusive .",
    "we also indicate to what extent and in which cases applying the vectorial constraint to nematic director of the main - chain polymer is invalidated , even in the case of perfectly rigid chains , and leads to fundamentally wrong conclusions .",
    "in addition we show that the two constituent conservation laws are manifest in the two extreme cases of flexible and inflexible chains , respectively .",
    "the present analysis is also relevant to ascertain the detectability of the two constraints , whether to pinpoint the observable differences between them or the novel features of their joint implementation , for which a detailed simulation approach , on which we recently embarked , seems at present to be our best guide @xcite .",
    "on the macroscopic level , the microscopic connectivity of monomers into the chain of a main - chain polymer nematic shows up as a constraint linking director deformations and density variations . since its formulation ,",
    "the accepted form of this constraint has been @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the surface density of polymer chains perforating the plane perpendicular to the nematic director @xmath2 , while @xmath3 and @xmath4 are volume densities of the beginnings and endings of chains , respectively .",
    "this constraint has been used in connection with the nematic director , i.e. , the principal axis of the nematic order tensor @xmath5 , describing quadrupolar orientational ordering @xcite .    including the modulus of the orientational ordering",

    "this purely geometric ( kinematic ) continuity condition , just like the vectorial analogue eq .",

    "( [ tensorial ] ) is however not the complete story  it is a necessary but , in general , not the only condition the tensorial configuration must satisfy .",
    "namely , since quadrupolar order is insensitive to chain backfolding , the tensorial constraint eq .",
    "( [ tensorial ] ) is not at all affected by the flexibility of the chain .",
    "therefore , in order to describe the chain rigidity ( semi - flexibility ) , the tensorial constraint requires the backup of the tighter vectorial constraint eq .",

    "indeed we will show that inflexible chains ( no chain backfolding ) should follow closely the vectorial conservation eq .",
    "( [ vectorial ] ) for the nematic director ( which can be defined as a vector in this limit ) , and that flexible chains with strong backfolding , and therefore necessarily with a vanishing local mesoscopic polar order of chain tangents , should satisfy the tensorial conservation eq .",
    "( [ tensorial ] ) .",
    "the aim here is thus to shed light on the connection between the vectorial and the tensorial conservation laws and to elaborate on the correct application of both conservation laws to the general case of semi - flexible chains , which should include the limits of inflexible and flexible chains as special cases .",
    "the vectorial conservation law has been standardly used for the nematic director , and vice versa , the constraint linking density variations and nematic director deformations has been implemented exclusively in terms of the vectorial conservation law . however , in principle , this is problematic .",
    "the vectorial conservation law is the continuity equation for the polymer current density , which is a vectorial quantity . as such , strictly speaking it can not be expressed in terms of a quantity with quadrupolar symmetry like the nematic director . in this section",
    "we present the underlying argument that nevertheless enables the use of the vectorial conservation law also for the nonpolar nematic director .",
    "the basis of this argument is the interpretation of chain hairpins ( point - like @xmath18 turns ) as effective chain ends .",
    "this viewpoint dates back to odijk @xcite and is also reflected in subsequent stat - mech results @xcite . here",
    "we articulate it for general backfoldings , in a way that rigorously connects with the macroscopic vectorial conservation law eq .",
    "( [ vectorial ] ) .    in a system of chains that does not exhibit macroscopic polar order ( the chains themselves can be either apolar or polar ) , one can not define a vectorial order parameter . if a polar orientational order is nevertheless defined in a local mesoscopic volume by an arbitrary convention of the chain directions ( e.g. such as to maximize the so - defined local polar order ) , it will decay away from this point with a finite characteristic length ( represented by the global persistence length @xcite ) depending on the density of hairpins or the extent of chain backfolding in general .",
    "this decay length is not necessarily small and may be comparable to other length scales in the system including the system size .",
    "it distinguishes between ensembles of stiff vs. flexible chains and is therefore a physical reality  not in terms of orientational order ( which for apolar phases and , by definition , for apolar chains is insensitive to the extent of backfolding ) , but in terms of the chain backfolding configurational degrees of freedom .    following the arguments presented by odijk , the density of top and bottom hairpins @xcite should enter the vectorial conservation law as a source term , similar to the density of chain heads and tails in eq .",
    "( [ vectorial ] ) . but",
    "how can one consistently apply the vectorial conservation law if the polar orientational order can not be defined ?",
    "one can circumvent the inherent destruction of polar orientational order due to chain backfolding , by introducing virtual ( imaginary ) cuts in every chain as soon and each time it gets _ backfolded _ with respect to the nematic director , fig .",

    "every cut generates a @xmath21 chain sink and a @xmath22 chain source that coincide and thus add to zero .",
    "such cuts are therefore purely imaginary and have no observable effect . however , now one can , without any physical change , reverse all the segments between those virtual cuts that have @xmath23 , thereby also swapping the sources and sinks of these segments , fig .",

    "the previous coinciding sources and sinks we now generated @xmath24 sources and @xmath25 sinks , separated in the directions upstream and downstream with respect to @xmath19 , respectively , and in particular , we created a nonvanishing macroscopic polar order @xmath26 of chain tangents  the _ recovered polar order _ ",

    "as soon as the density of backfoldings increases , however , @xmath32 is lowered and eventually vanishes in the strong backfolding limit @xmath56 .",
    "to recapitulate , the recovered polar order is insensitive to the degree of chain backfolding and is thus a well - defined quantity .",
    "the strength of the vectorial constraint for the recovered polar order , however decreases with increasing degree of chain backfolding .",
    "moreover , in the limit of strong backfolding , this constraint vanishes completely .",
    "the strength of the vectorial constraint for the recovered polar order thus depends on the density of backfoldings ( besides the density of chain heads / tails ) and vice versa , in the continuum description the semi - flexibility of the polymer chain is controlled exactly and exclusively by the strength of this constraint .    in the light of this section ,",
    "the vectorial conservation law can thus be , perfectly rigorously , applied also to apolar nematic ordering .",
    "however , this is the conservation law for the recovered polar order and not for the quadrupolar order .",

    "the vectorial and tensorial conservation laws for main - chain polymer nematogens are not in general equivalent nor are they interchangeable . in fact",
    ", using the vectorial conservation law for the usual quadrupolar nematic order as described in section [ sec : recovered_polar ] is incomplete and generally inaccurate , except in the limit of perfect orientational ordering .",
    "there exist in general two major reasons why the tensorial conservation law must be taken into account in addition to the vectorial conservation law for the recovered polar order :    1 .   in the strong backfolding limit",
    ", the vectorial constraint for the recovered polar order vanishes as we have seen , thereby completely decoupling density variations and director deformations . due to the tensorial conservation law , however , another , although looser ( second order in the gradient ) constraint remains also in the strong backfolding limit ( vanishing global persistence length ) of ideally flexible chains .",
    "quadrupolar nematic order is described by the nematic @xmath5-tensor , i.e. , it is captured by averaging a tensorial quantity , not a vectorial one as in the case of the recovered polar order .",
    "the tensorial description comprises more degrees of freedom , which is reflected among others also in the fact that the sources of the tensorial conservation law ( the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tensorial ] ) ) besides the volume density of chain ends comprise also the direction of their tangents .",
    "as we have shown , only in the limit of perfect orientational order ( where the chains are perfectly aligned , all backfoldings are hairpins and there is no other directions involved ) both conservation laws are equivalent .    we propose that the generalized conservation law for semiflexible main - chain polymer nematics with usual quadrupolar ( tensorial ) nematic ordering should build on both , the vectorial as well as the tensorial conservation laws , implemented in the effective free energy via the penalty potentials . if the ordered phase is also polar , then the vectorial conservation law directly holds for its polar order .",
    "if , however , the quadrupolar order of this polar phase is included in the modeling ( e.g. if a measurement probes the quadrupolar order of the polar phase rather than its polar order ) , the generalized conservation law for the quadrupolar order applies to it in principle , notwithstanding the concurrent existence of the polar order .",
    "since in this case the backfolding is weak , there is little difference whether the actual or the recovered polar order enters the generalized conservation law for the quadrupolar order , but in principle it _ should be _ the recovered polar order .    the present analysis of the two continuity constraints , identifying the extent of polymer chain backfolding as the determinant of their relative importance , also suggests a possible method to detect and/or manipulate their strength .",
    "namely , in the case of dna , where sharp local kinks can be induced by the addition of certain dna binding proteins , an interesting new way to actually observe and control the role of the tensorial continuity constraint might be accessible by following the ordering of the chains in the solution and/or by monitoring the observable defects on adsorption of dna kinking proteins .",
    "this path is feasible and worth pursuing on the level of simulations as well as experiments .",
