    "almost all of us have already met someone far from home , who turns out to share a friend with us .",
    "milgram first put this social phenomenon on a firm basis , finding that any two individuals are separated , on average , by six acquaintances @xcite . furthermore , our society is composed of groups within which , if individual a is acquainted with persons b and c , then b is likely to know c. in the language of social networks , this means that the individuals a , b and c are arranged on a triangle .",
    "these two facts tell us that in the social universe , global distances are small , and local interconnectedness , i.e.  _ clustering _ , is high . a network that possesses both of these topological properties",
    "is called a _",
    "small world_. in order to find a model that accounts for both of these properties , one could choose a regular lattice whose nodes are indeed locally highly interconnected .",
    "but since global distances are large in this type of network , it is an ineligible candidate for a small world model . in a random graph @xcite , that is a set of nodes ( e.g.  laid out on a virtual circle ) with connections between them established at random ,",
    "a link is more likely to point to a far away node than to one close by .",
    "( here we refer to the distance on the virtual circle s circumference . ) as a consequence , the presence of the very many long - range links account for the desired global property , but the degree of clustering is low . watts and strogatz combined these two insights and proposed a model that interpolates between a regular lattice and a random graph , thus capturing both the global and local topological properties mentioned above @xcite .",
    "but the small world property is not merely exhibited by social networks . yet ,",
    "through the increased availability of data , it was found that the simultaneous occurence of high local _ and _ global interconnectedness is prominent to a much wider class of systems , notably the internet @xcite , the world wide web @xcite , metabolic networks @xcite and food webs @xcite .",
    "in addition to the small world property , there is another important fact when it comes to characterizing the topology of a complex network : not all the nodes have the same number of edges .",
    "the corresponding measure is the _ degree distribution _",
    "@xmath0 which gives the probability that a randomly chosen node has degree @xmath1 , that is @xmath1 edges . for most of the just mentioned examples ,",
    "this distribution was found to be @xmath2 , @xmath3 , implying the absence of a characteristic ( degree ) scale , hence the name _ scale - free _ network .",
    "this emergence of scaling can be understood , for example , in terms of _ growing _ networks .",
    "starting from a small core graph , at each time step a node is added together with a certain number of edges that are connected to existing nodes , the latter being chosen _ preferentially _ , that is a link is more likely established to a high degree node @xcite .",
    "this fat - tailed degree distribution implies the presence of _ hubs _ ( high degree nodes ) which hold together the network and play a crucial role in issues such as robustness or fragility @xcite .",
    "this explosion of research activity in the field of complex networks has also shed new light on epidemic spreading since the latter can be regarded as a dynamical process occuring on a complex network : a computer virus spreads on the internet , and hiv ( as a biological example ) propagates on top of the web of human sexual contacts .",
    "also these two examples fall into the category of scale - free networks @xcite , and it is this topological property that accounts for the absence of a finite epidemic threshold in the corresponding spreading phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the degree distribution is only a first way to characterize the degree related topology of a complex network .",
    "indeed , by analyzing scientific collaboration networks , researchers working with many others ( high degree nodes ) tend to collaborate with other `` hubs '' .",
    "this means that there exist _ degree correlations _ , and the just mentioned property has been called _ assortative mixing _ , holding generally for social networks @xcite . on the other hand , in the internet ( at the autonomous system level ) , high degree nodes are more likely connected to low degree ones , thus exhibiting _ disassortative _ mixing .",
    "the influence of such degree correlations on the spreading of an epidemic was investigated in detail @xcite , finding that neither assortative nor disassortative scale - free networks exhibit a finite epidemic threshold @xcite .",
    "the insights about the role of these degree related topological properties in epidemic spreading have been gained at the mean - field level .    besides degree correlations , triangles are ubiquitous in complex networks as outlined in the first paragraph , and more generally , many loops of short length were found in these systems @xcite . motivated by watts and strogatz model @xcite which uses a regular lattice , i.e.  an ordered network possessing many loops , as starting point",
    ", we shall also use the concept of _ local ordering _ when referring to the loop structure of a complex network .",
    "more information can be extracted if the triangles are sorted according to the degrees of their corners , finding that mainly the low degree nodes account for the high level of clustering @xcite .",
    "this suggests the presence of interesting modular organizations , and similar results were obtained from an analysis of loops of length 4 @xcite .",
    "local ordering plays a crucial role in the function of a metabolic network ( with scale - free topology ) .",
    "indeed , the loop structure is much richer than in the scale - free model based on growth and preferential attachment @xcite .",
    "this work also investigates the number of triangles as a function of the system size for this model , a result which was generalized to loops up to length 5 , yielding robust scaling relations @xcite .",
    "obviously the presence of loops has an effect on the spreading behavior since , with respect to a treelike topology , there exist many more paths along which the virus can propagate .",
    "different strategies in order to gain insights about the role of local ordering properties have been proposed .",
    "an interpretation of how clustering influences the stationary spreading behavior was obtained by mapping the epidemic process onto bond percolation @xcite .",
    "another approach is to abandon the mean - field level and take into account spatial correlations which govern the epidemic dynamics .",
    "matsuda et al . first used the ordinary pair approximation in order to study a population dynamical problem @xcite .",
    "this approximation , as its name anticipates , accounts for pair correlations and lies at the basis of improved pair models @xcite which uncover the role of local ordering in a rather indirect way : clustering enters by making a number of assumptions about the open ( @xmath4 ) and closed ( @xmath5 ) triple correlations . in cluster approximations ,",
    "a time - dependent probability is assigned to each configuration of the fundamental cluster whose choice is guided by the network topology @xcite : for investigating the spreading dynamics on a triangular lattice one uses a triangle as fundamental cluster whereas the star is the appropriate choice for a random network .",
    "higher - order correlations are therefore embedded very explicitly .",
    "moreover the systematic improvability of this method makes it a powerful tool to study probabilistic systems .    in order to understand the role of local ordering properties",
    ", the exploration of temporal correlations seems to be an even more natural approach : for example within a two - step description , it matters whether the local topology is treelike or if loops of short length are present .",
    "the method is illustrated for the susceptible - infected - susceptible model ( see for example @xcite ) , homogeneous networks are used as starting point , and analytical estimates are obtained also for disordered graphs obeying @xmath6 , @xmath7 being arbitrary .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the adopted model consisting of the contact network as well as the local dynamics . in section iii",
    ", we introduce the formalism , from which the two - step description is derived . for completeness ,",
    "the necessary ingredients in order to arrive at the one - step site approximation , i.e.  the common mean - field level , are also shown .",
    "section iv explores the implications of the double - step approach for networks of degree 4 , the generalization to arbitrary degree is done in the following section .",
    "the major conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
    "the dynamical laws that describe the spreading of an infectious disease are determined by the contact structure which underlies the population .",
    "we therefore model the epidemic as a dynamical process on top of a given network that does not change in time .",
    "the nodes of the network represent individuals , and the links correspond to relationships between individuals along which an infective agent can propagate .",
    "since the aim of this paper is the investigation of the role of loops of short length , we adopt a rather simple epidemiological model where the individuals can be only in two possible states , namely infected ( i ) or susceptible ( s ) .",
    "because the nodes repeatedly run through the cycle susceptible @xmath8 infected @xmath8 susceptible , it is called sis model . in the physics community",
    ", it has recently been formulated as follows @xcite : a node susceptible to the disease gets infected with probability @xmath9 if it is connected to at least one infected nearest neighbor . on the other hand ,",
    "infected nodes recover spontaneously with probability @xmath10 .",
    "this version of the sis model is formally advantageous with respect to its conventional formulation , where infected nodes can infect neighboring susceptible vertices with probability @xmath9 @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "susceptible nodes become infected with probability @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the number of infected nearest neighbors . in this paper",
    ", we will use the former version . by rescaling the time unit",
    ", we can reduce the number of parameters to one : the time evolution is determined by the effective spreading rate @xmath13 , and the recovery rate is set to 1 .",
    "the quantitative details of the behavior of the system still depend on the choice of @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , the effect of the loops are of higher order in @xmath14 , such that their influence is not seen in the continuous - time limit ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "as long as @xmath16 , we set this quantity to 1 without lack of generality .",
    "the other model constituent concerns the underlying network . we shall not attempt to examine the combined effect of the degree distribution , degree correlations and the loop structure .",
    "while the role of these degree related connectivity patterns in epidemic spreading is rather well understood , little attention has been given to the effect of local ordering .",
    "that is why we focus on this topological property .",
    "we therefore use networks in which every node has the same number of nearest neighbors ( fixed degree ) .",
    "the adopted strategy is to start with strictly homogeneous graphs ( networks in which identical connectivity patterns are `` seen '' from every node ) differing in the detailed loop structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hom4_ex ] ) .",
    "this leads us to an understanding of the role of these distinct local ordering properties , even for networks that are nolonger strictly homogeneous but which still obey @xmath6 , k being the constant degree .    in the case @xmath17 , examples of purely homogeneous networks are the random homogeneous network ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hom4_ex]a ) constructed according to the molloy reed algorithm @xcite , the square lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hom4_ex]b ) , the kagom lattice ( usually used in condensed matter physics as this geometry represents one of the most frustrated antiferromagnetic systems , fig .",
    "[ fig : hom4_ex]c ) and a ring where nodes two units apart from each other are also directly connected ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hom4_ex]d ) . for the random network ,",
    "the homogeneity definition given above only holds approximately . while loops of short length do not occur in the limit of large network size",
    ", long ones of various lengths may exist .",
    "therefore different nodes may not `` see '' identical connectiviy patterns .",
    "also the cayley tree lacks completely in loops .",
    "but as the last generation of nodes has degree 1 , it does not fall into the class of homogeneous networks . indeed , since the number of nodes belonging to generation @xmath18 is @xmath19 , most of the nodes are even comprised within the last generation .",
    "clearly , all the networks depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hom4_ex ] are characterized by the degree distribution @xmath20 , but they differ in the way the second neighbors are arranged , that is the loop structure becomes richer going from ( a ) to ( d ) .",
    "while the random network has no short loops at all , the ones of length 4 are a fingerprint of the square lattice . in the kagom lattice ,",
    "every node is a corner of two distinct triangles .",
    "finally , in the ring of degree 4 , triangles and two different kinds of loops of length 4 are found , namely plaquettes ( as in the square lattice ) and the so - called primary quadrilaterals ( two adjacent triangles ) , see section ivb .    in order to study the epidemic process on disordered `` homogeneous '' topologies , we subject the networks in fig .  [",
    "fig : hom4_ex]b - d to the following rearrangement algorithm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rewir ] ) @xcite :    * choose randomly two links ( link 1 connecting node @xmath21 with @xmath22 and connection 2 linking vertex @xmath23 with @xmath24 ) that do not share a common node . *",
    "remove these two links and establish two new connections between @xmath21 and @xmath24 as well as @xmath23 and @xmath22 .",
    "repeating this rewiring procedure a certain number of times leads to locally varying numbers of loops while the degree distribution remains unaltered .",
    "in this section , we shall introduce the formalism that is used in order to describe the dynamics on top of the networks specified in the previous section . for completeness , we then derive the ( single - step ) mean - field approximation which could also be obtained heuristically . in the last paragraph",
    ", we derive a two - step description that allows us to gain insight about the loop structure in epidemic spreading .    on an exact level",
    ", we shall describe the epidemic dynamics by assigning a probabilty @xmath25 to each configuration @xmath26 at every instant of time @xmath27 .",
    "the vector @xmath26 contains the states @xmath28 of all the nodes @xmath29 of the network , @xmath28 being either 0 ( susceptible ) or 1 ( infected ) .",
    "the system probabilities satisfy at any time @xmath27 @xmath30 and evolve in time according to @xmath31 the transition matrix of the system @xmath32 is obtained from the matrix @xmath33 which shall denote the probability that the state of the arbitrary site @xmath34 changes from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , through @xmath37 n being the total number of nodes in the network .",
    "the matrix elements representing the probabilites for the possible events at the site @xmath34 are given by our version of the sis model , namely @xmath38 \\\\",

    "the factor @xmath41 is 1 if at least one @xmath42 and 0 otherwise .    before deriving our two - timestep description , we show how the conventional mean - field approximation is retrieved through this formalism . at that level ,",

    "the left hand side of the above equation corresponds to the probability that node @xmath48 is in state @xmath46 at time @xmath49 . with the ansatz ( [ equ : hom_mix ] ) ,",

    "[ fig : hom4_ex ] are treated identically at this level of description .",
    "the only topological property that determines the critical value of the effective spreading rate @xmath57 is the number of nearest neighbors @xmath7 .",
    "improvements upon the mean - field description can be obtained by taking into account spatial correlations .",
    "based on the ordinary pair approximation @xcite , the presence of triangles enters by establishing a number of hypotheses about the open and closed triple correlations @xcite .",
    "this approach therefore embeds this topological property in a rather implicit way . in cluster approximations @xcite , the local topology and",
    "its associated spatial correlations translate directly into the choice of the cluster and a set of probabilities for its possible configurations .",
    "another strategy that serves to incorporate local ordering properties is to take into account temporal correlations .",
    "thus by performing two timesteps exactly , we expect that the way the second neighbors are arranged , enters very naturally into the description .",
    "for example , the cases where two nearest neighbors of an arbitrary node are also directly connected ( presence of a triangle ) , where they are linked via a second neighbor ( giving rise to a loop of length 4 ) or where the only path goes through the original node ( treelike structure ) , lead to different results . in the remaining part of this section , we derive the general equation , special cases are then looked at within the following section .",

    ", an expectation value of a product of @xmath68 @xmath69-factors will be referred to as a term of @xmath68-th order although it is proportional to @xmath70 . as is illustrated in detail in the next section , every term of eq .",
    "( [ equ : exact2 ] ) corresponds to a subgraph of the graph composed of the nodes @xmath66 and whose links are according to the network under investigation .",
    "it can already be anticipated that the first term accounts for the degree distribution only , whereas the contributions of higher order will give insight about the role of the loop structure .",
    "in this section , we elaborate the implications of our two - step description , the analysis being restricted to the stationary state .    in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig : hom4_reg ] , we show the simulation results for the graphs introduced in section ii .",
    "the ring - type network exhibits the largest epidemic threshold . for both the square and kagom lattices ,",
    "the critical value is @xmath71 .",
    "we therefore anticipate that either four plaquettes or two triangles ( per node ) lead to the same effect in the regime of low prevalences .",
    "finally , the lowest epidemic threshold is found if the population is arranged on a homogeneous random network ( of degree 4 ) .",
    "the last result is very intuitive since in such a graph , global distances are small , making it more easy for a virus to spread .",
    "therefore , even if the effective spreading rate is rather low , a finite fraction of the population will be infected in the stationary state , hence the small value for the location of the onset of the epidemic . in summary , these results indicate that the poorer the loop structure , the lower the corresponding epidemic threshold .    in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : hom4_reg ] , the one - step and two - step site approximations are reported .",

    "( [ equ:1step_thr ] ) .",
    "all the networks in question are therefore treated identically , the loop structure being ignored at this level of description .",
    "yet , the two - step solutions [ eq .  ( [ equ:2steps ] ) ]",
    "are diverse for the different graphs . going from right to left ,",
    "the curves correspond to the ring , the square lattice , the kagom lattice and the molloy - reed network , that is they appear in the same sequence as at the level of simulation .",
    "furthermore , the curves corresponding to the kagom and square lattice also meet the @xmath74-axis at the same value of @xmath57 .",
    "these findings confirm our intuitive arguments given in the previous section .",
    "it has to be noted that the two - step estimates for the threshold values are still considerably inaccurate especially for the ring and lattices , but this just highlights the presence of higher - order spatiotemporal correlations .",
    "however , the important point is that the degeneracy associated to the one - step description disappers at the two - step level .",
    "we shall now evaluate all the terms of eq .",
    "( [ equ : exact2 ] ) for a locally treelike topology .",
    "[ fig : tree_sub ] shows the subgraphs representing the terms in eq .",
