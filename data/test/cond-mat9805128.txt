    "the berry phase  @xcite remains a fascinating subject with many consequences in a variety of physical systems  @xcite .",
    "some time ago we proposed  @xcite a number of scenarios in condensed matter settings where the berry phase manifests itself in the phase - coherent quantum dynamics of a particle carrying a spin and moving through orientationally inhomogeneous magnetic fields @xmath0 .",
    "such manifestations of the berry phase can occur , e.g. , in semiconductors or metals in the form of persistent currents  @xcite or oscillations of the magnetoconductance or universal conductance fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "as recognized early on@xcite , all these effects share the common feature that the orbital motion of the particle is modified by the berry phase in very much the same way as it is in well - known phase - coherent phenomena based on the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "the first experimental evidence for such a berry phase effect has been recently found in semiconductors  @xcite , in which a local effective magnetic field is produced via the rashba effect .    however , whereas aharonov - bohm effects occur regardless of the strength @xmath1 of the field , berry phase effects appear only in the adiabatic limit , i.e. , for sufficiently large magnetic fields .",
    "this limit requires that  roughly speaking  the typical orbital frequency of the particle carrying the spin through the field is much smaller than the precession frequency of the spin around the local field direction . in this limit",
    ", the spin will remain in its instantaneous eigenstate , i.e. , will continuously align itself along the _ local _ field direction @xmath0 as it moves through the magnetic field texture .",
    "if , in addition , the particle trajectory is closed , the spin will acquire a berry phase , which is purely geometric in character . as spin and orbital motion couple via the inhomogeneity of the field , the berry phase can ultimately enter the orbital part of the effective hamiltonian in the same way that the aharonov - bohm phase does .",
    "there seems to be general agreement that once the adiabatic limit is reached the results found previously  @xcite are correct .",
    "the central question then is : what is the proper criterion for the adiabatic regime ?",
    "again , there is no issue of contention in ballistic rings , e.g. , for which adiabaticity is reached when @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the bohr frequency ( to be defined below ) , and @xmath4 is the typical time it takes the particle to go around the ring once .",
    "this situation occurs , e.g. , in clean semiconductors .",
    "but what about diffusive systems , such as normal metal rings ?",
    "it is this question that we have previously addressed in great detail  @xcite and that has been recently reconsidered by van langen et al .",
    "@xcite , who claim to reach a rather pessimistic conclusion about the observability of the berry phase effect  in stark contrast to our findings  @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to show that the claim of van langen et al .",
    "@xcite is not correct . to this end , we first state the problem of adiabaticity in this section again and then provide in the following sections a general discussion on the issue of dephasing induced by inhomogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "this discussion is then followed by explicit examples that unambiguously demonstrate the observability of berry phase effects in diffusive systems of immediate experimental interest .    now , in the context of weak localization physics we have advanced detailed physical and technical arguments  @xcite that adiabaticity is reached more easily in diffusive than in ballistic systems ( all other parameters being equal ) .",
    "the physical explanation for this is simple : in diffusive motion around , say , a ring , the particle spends on the average much more time in a given region of field direction than it would do in purely ballistic motion .",
    "thus , there is more time for the spin to execute precessions around a given field direction , and thus the spin will have a higher probability of aligning itself along the local field direction than it would in purely ballistic motion . translating this picture into more concrete terms for an electron diffusing around a @xmath5-dimensional ring of circumference @xmath6 with static random disorder",
    ", adiabaticity is reached if the zeeman energy , @xmath7 , exceeds the thouless energy , @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the electron g - factor , @xmath10 is the bohr magneton , @xmath11 is the diffusion constant with @xmath12 being fermi velocity , @xmath13 is the elastic mean free time , and @xmath14 is the elastic mean free path . more generally , we can also allow for the case in which the field reorients @xmath15 times as the particle goes around once the ring . whereas the case of @xmath16 is physically realizable  @xcite , it seems very difficult to implement cases with @xmath17 experimentally . still , as the conclusions reached by van  langen et al .",
    "@xcite are crucially based on the case @xmath18 , we shall include this possibility , and the criterion for adiabaticity as found in ref .",
    "@xcite then reads @xmath19 here , the texture  dependent vector @xmath20 is some average of the direction of the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath21 accounts for non - uniformity in the direction of the magnetic field , and encodes the fact that the adiabatic approximation becomes exact , regardless of @xmath3 , in the limit of a homogeneous field , for which @xmath22 . in the following discussion",
    ", however , we shall  for the sake of simplicity ",
    "omit this factor , noting that its inclusion would render the criterion even less stringent )  @xcite .",
    "as in metals one typically has @xmath23 of the order of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we should have , for a ring of circumference @xmath27 , magnetic fields at least of the order of @xmath28  gauss to be within the adiabatic regime .",
    "note that without the diffusive factor , @xmath29 , the required fields would be too large to be attainable experimentally ( i.e. , on the order of @xmath30 ) .",
    "the regime of adiabaticity defined in eq .",
    "( [ adiabaticity ] ) follows from a detailed derivation of the cooperon and diffuson propagator based on weak localization techniques and an adiabatic approximation scheme  @xcite .",
    "this adiabatic approximation is performed in the path intgral representation for the cooperon ( diffuson ) .",
    "as emphasized in an analogous discussion of the imaginary - time propagator in the context of persistent currents  @xcite , the adiabatic approximation can contain additional angle - dependent terms that are different from the berry phase , and these terms can mask the berry phase in certain physical observables .",
    "( for an explicit example of such a case , see sec .",
    "vi  f of ref .",
    "the origin of this additonal term can be traced back to quantum fluctuations of the particle trajectory , which induce non - smooth variations of the magnetic field ( and thereby violate the smooth variation  assumption that underlies the adiabatic approximation)@xcite . an alternative way to express",
    "this point is to say that in certain cases the berry phase can be masked by dephasing effects  in very much the same way that the aharonov - bohm phase can become unobservable if dephasing influences become too large .",
    "such dephasing effects are difficult to calculate for a general texture , but can sometimes be obtained in special cases for which an exact solution is available ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and below ) . as suggested in ref .",
    ", it is possible to extend the exact solution for a propagator containing a single spin-1/2 particle  @xcite to the one containing two spin-1/2 particels .",
    "indeed , by following this suggestion van  langen et al .",
    "@xcite re - calculate the magnetoconductance for a cylindrically symmetrical texture , and claim to find deviations from our adiabatic solution  @xcite .",
    "( as we shall show , these deviations are only apparent.)van  langen et al .",
    "conclude from this observation that the exact solution does not contain the berry phase effect , and thus that the regime of adiabaticity , given in eq .",
    "( [ adiabaticity ] ) , is invalid .",
    "instead , adopting a suggestion made first by stern  @xcite , van  langen et al.@xcite claim that it is necessary for the much more stringent conditon , @xmath31 to be satisfied in diffusive systems before adiabaticity is reached , and thus before the berry phase effect can become observable in the magnetoconductance .",
    "it is specifically this claim that is incorrect . on the contrary",
    ", we will show that precisely our adiabaticity criterion , eq .",
    "( [ adiabaticity ] ) , is appropriate for diffusive systems , and that the observability or non - observability of the berry phase crucially depends on the choice of physical parameters [ in the adiabatic regime given by eq .",
    "( [ adiabaticity ] ) ] .",
    "indeed , van  langen et al.@xcite concentrate on the rather unphysical choice that the field winds five times around the ring ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) , and as dephasing effects grow strongly with @xmath15 ( as @xmath33 ; see below ) , it comes as little surprise that berry phase oscillations are not discernible in this extreme case .",
    "however , upon choosing @xmath16the physically most relevant case  not only do berry phase effects show up in the exact solution , but also they agree well with our previously - obtained adiabatic predictions .",
    "van langen et al.@xcite have studied the issue of adiabaticity also in terms of boltzmann equations . due to the coupling of the magnetic field to the orbital motion of the charged electron these boltzmann equations",
    "are valid in the diffusive regime defined by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "as @xmath35 and @xmath3 are typically of the same order of magnitude in metals , the regime @xmath36 studied by van  langen et al .",
    "lies _ outside _ the physical regime to which their boltzmann equations can legitimately be applied . still , even if we adopt their academic point of view and ignore such orbital effects ( i.e. set the electron charge to zero ) , the regime @xmath36 is problematic for an additional reason  @xcite . if @xmath36 , the zeeman rate @xmath3 is large compared to the elastic collision rate @xmath37 . in this case",
    "we expect the zeeman interaction to have a strong dephasing influence on the orbital motion ( for inhomogeneous fields ) , especially when @xmath38 , and the system lies outside the semiclassical regime in the sense of weak localization theory ( see , e.g. , secs .  4 and 10 of ref .   and",
    "this issue has not been discussed by van  langen et al .  in the context of their boltzmann equations .    finally , none of the effects discussed by van  langen et al .",
    "in terms of their boltzmann equation have been shown explicitly to be related to the berry phase . without such information at hand",
    "it is not possible to tell whether the effects they find are of dynamical ( non - phase - coherent ) or geometrical ( berry phase ) origin , as both of them can occur in an adiabatic approximation to the quantum dynamics .",
    "as we are interested in the berry phase effect associated with phase - coherence and occurring in physical observables , we shall not comment any further on the boltzmann equation approach of van  langen et al .",
    ", and instead shall concentrate on the magnetoconductance expressed in terms of the cooperon propagator  @xcite .    still , we do wish to point out that although we do not agree with the final conclusions reached by van  langen et al .",
    ", we have found their work stimulating , inasmuch as it has motivated us to clarify the issue of dephasing which , in turn , has allowed us to establish more concrete predictions about the range of observability of the berry phase in the magnetoconductance of diffusive metallic systems .",
    "we consider a quasi - one - dimensional ring of circumference @xmath6 , embedded in a magnetic field texture given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the location on the ring , @xmath41 is the tilt angle of the magnetic field , and @xmath42 is the winding of the magnetic field along the propagation direction .",
    "the magnitude @xmath1 and , in particular , the tilt angle @xmath41 are assumed to be constant . it is this special case that can be solved exactly ( as pointed out in ref .  ) along the same lines as discussed in ref .   for a single - spin propagator .",
    "van  langen et al .",
    "@xcite were the first to write down this solution explicitly for a two - spin propagator .",
    "the magnetoconductance resulting from weak localization corrections and in the presence of the field texture @xmath43 has been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and reads , @xmath44 where the effective ( non - hermitian ) hamiltonian @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( with @xmath48 ) are spin-1/2 pauli matrices , and where @xmath49 is the dimensionless adiabaticity parameter [ see eq .",
    "( [ adiabaticity ] ) ] .",
    "the factor @xmath50 is a damping constant expressed in terms of the dephasing length @xmath51 ( which is specified in more detail below ) .",
    "note that @xmath52 is introduced here in a phenomenological way with the particular _ ad hoc _ choice that it be a c - number and diagonal in spin space .",
    "we now evaluate @xmath53 explicitly , but instead of using the exact eigenstates , as was done by van  langen et al .",
    "@xcite , we use an alternative approach in terms of unitary gauge transformations , which has the virtue of making the emergence of the berry phase immediately transparent .",
    "for this purpose we define unitary transformations @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the form @xmath56 with the property that @xmath57 by noting that @xmath58 , we find @xmath59)^2 + i\\kappa\\ , ( \\sigma_{1z}-\\sigma_{2z } ) .",

    "note that two of the eigenvalues of @xmath70 are given by the ( geometric ) berry phase @xmath71 for an effectively integral spin @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath72 provides a source of dephasing that can mask the berry phase  and more generally the aharonov - bohm effect ( see , sec .",

    ", we have allowed for an aharonov - bohm flux @xmath80 , with @xmath81 being the flux quantum .",
    "the foregoing result is exact and is seen to be identical to the one obtained by van  langen et al .",
    "@xcite ( for their choice @xmath82 ) . however , our alternative derivation has led us to a form in which the berry phase contribution is made manifest in the terms of the form @xmath83 .",
    "next we go over to the adiabatic limit , defined here by @xmath84 , which , for @xmath16 , is equivalent to @xmath85 [ see eq .",
    "( [ adiabaticity ] ) ] .",
    "( below , in sec .  [ observability ] , we give explicit numerical values of @xmath86 for which adiabaticity is reached . )   in this limit we may drop the terms independent of @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ moscexact ] ) ( this is justified as terms with large @xmath69 give a negligible contribution to @xmath53 ) .",

    "note that the berry phase @xmath89 couples to the momentum like the aharonov - bohm phase does , i.e. , via @xmath90 .",
    "we note that the remaining @xmath41-dependence can not be accounted for by this type of coupling to the momentum .",
    "we particularly emphasize that ( apart from the flux appearing in @xmath79 ) the adiabatic limit of the magnetoconductance @xmath91 is independent of the field amplitude @xmath1 ; thus , increasing the field further , say up to @xmath92 ( cf .",
    "( [ schrott ] ) ) , has no effect .",
    "it is now instructive to compare eq .",
    "( [ moscadiabatic ] ) with the one previously derived  @xcite for arbitrary textures and in the adiabatic approximation scheme for the berry phase .",
    "the latter result reads @xmath93[\\gamma'+(m+\\alpha f\\cos\\eta)^2]}\\,\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , again , @xmath79 , and @xmath94 , and where we have used some identities to facilitate comparison .",
    "note that in general @xmath95 ( see below ) .",
    "the virtue of @xmath96 is that it is valid for arbitrary field textures ( with the appropriate berry phase  @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus important to understand its relation to the special but exactly solvable case .",
    "now , by comparing @xmath96 with @xmath91 we see that the two expressions have the same structure with respect to the berry phase , @xmath97 , but differ in additional @xmath41- and @xmath15-dependent terms .",
    "( from now on we put the aharonov - bohm flux @xmath98 to zero but shall return to nonzero flux later . )   particularly important is the additional term in the denominator of @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath99 ( the physical origin of such additional terms is discussed below in sec.[physical ] ) .",
    "it is this term that acts as a _ dephasing source _ for certain tilt angles and windings @xmath15 by suppressing the  resonance peaks \" that would occur at integral values of the berry phase @xmath89 ( for small enough @xmath100 ) . for @xmath17 the suppression due to",
    "this term is so strong that all resonances except the ones at @xmath101 become masked , i.e. , these resonances due to the berry phase are no longer visible in graphs of @xmath91 versus @xmath41 , whereas they do show up in @xmath96 _ provided _ one chooses @xmath100 to be independent of the tilt angle @xmath41 ( and sufficiently small ) .",
    "it is this _ ad hoc _",
    "choice for @xmath15 and @xmath100 that has been adopted by van  langen et al .",
    "in particular , they choose @xmath18 and a constant @xmath102 . as in this case @xmath96 and @xmath91 behave differently for @xmath103 ( see fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , van  langen et al.@xcite conclude that @xmath91 is not showing adiabatic behavior and , thus , that our criterion for adiabaticity , eq .",
    "( [ adiabaticity ] ) , is not correct .",
    "however , this conclusion of van  langen et al .  is premature .",
    "there are two main reasons for this : first , they have ignored the issue of dephasing induced by the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field , and connected to this , second , the issue of the self - consistency of the semiclassical approximation on which the derivation of the cooperon propagator rests .",
    "we now discuss these issues in turn , and then present physical examples to illustrate the general discussion .",
    "the _ ad hoc _ choice by van  langen et al .",
    "@xcite of putting @xmath103 and choosing them to be independent of @xmath41 means that @xmath91 and @xmath96 do _ not _ describe the same physical situation .",
    "this is so for the following reason .",
    "first we note again that the dephasing parameters @xmath104 are  put in by hand \" into the cooperon to account for dephasing in a phenomenological way ( this is just dictated by the complexity of the involved many - body problem and by our inability to address this issue in a more systematic way in general ) . in the derivation of @xmath96 dephasing due to the field is only taken into account _ a posteriori _ in terms of a phenomenological parameter @xmath100 , while the exact solution , eq .  ( [ moscexact ] ) ,",
    "not only includes the berry phase but simultaneously also those dephasing effects that are caused by the field through the zeeman coupling . the remaining dephasing effects in @xmath53 or @xmath91",
    "are then included via the phenomenological parameter @xmath52 .",
    "obviously , @xmath52 and @xmath100 are in general different for the same physical situation .",
    "next , it is a well - known fact in the context of weak - localization phenomena  @xcite that dephasing in general depends on the magnetic field @xmath43 penetrating the sample ( as we must allow for there to be any zeeman interaction at all ) .",
    "most importantly , @xmath100 not only depends , in general , on the magnitude @xmath1 of the field but also on its tilt angle @xmath41 that the field makes with the @xmath105-axis perpendicular to the ring plane .",
    "( this is already so even without zeeman terms , see , e.g. , sec .  2 of ref .",
    "there can be little surprise that the angle dependence becomes even more pronounced in the presence of our inhomogeneous zeeman interaction ) .",
    "the various dephasing effects are accounted for phenomenologically in terms of dephasing lengths  @xcite , @xmath106 , where the dephasing length @xmath107 contains all field - independent contributions , such as the one coming from inelastic collisons of the diffusing electron with , say , phonons , @xmath108 , where the dephasing time @xmath109 is some inelastic scattering time .",
    "the magnetic length @xmath110 contains all effects coming from the field penetrating the sample .",
    "if now @xmath111 for some field configurations , we no longer expect to see phase - coherence in general . as a matter of fact , in sec .",
    "iv of ref .",
    "we have estimated the upper bound of the dephasing length ( due to the inhomogeneous zeeman interaction ) in metallic films to be given by the characteristic field - reorientation length @xmath112 .",
    "this estimate follows from the observation that quantum corrections begin to be eliminated when the largest phase - coherent paths enclose roughly one quantum of berry flux . for the symmetric texture considered here we find @xmath113 . obviously , for certain tilt - angles and for @xmath38 this upper bound on the dephasing length quickly becomes smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "translated into a dephasing parameter @xmath114 , this estimate reads @xmath115 i.e. , we see that the dephasing becomes explicitly @xmath41-dependent and grows like @xmath33 .    thus , it is by no means surprising that the exact solution confirms this general expectation , in the sense that explicit dephasing terms are present in @xmath53 that are field - dependent and which can become so large , for _ particular _ field inhomogeneities , that they completely suppress the resonances in the magnetoconductance , eq .",
    "( [ moscexact ] ) , with respect to the berry phase  @xcite , no matter how large @xmath116 is .",
    "of course , as implied by above discussion leading to eq .",
    "( [ estimate ] ) , such a dephasing effect must also be accounted for explicitly in @xmath96 , eq .",
    "( [ mosclsg ] ) , by an appropriate choice for the phenomenological damping parameter @xmath100 .",
    "in particular , in view of the estimate given in eq .  ( [ estimate ] ) , it is reasonable to make the ansatz @xmath117  @xcite .",
    "then , choosing the dephasing parameter of @xmath91 to be constant ( i.e. @xmath41-independent ) and much smaller than unity , say @xmath118 , we see that the qualitative discrepancy between @xmath96 and @xmath91 disappears : both expressions show no resonances ( away from @xmath119 ) .",
    "( we note that as @xmath52 and @xmath100 are introduced phenomenologically anyway , there is no need to get quantitative agreement , and it suffices to find the same qualitative suppression of the resonances for @xmath17 in both @xmath96 and @xmath91 . we shall not be making any further use of this ansatz for @xmath100 . )",
    "the suppression of the cooperon due to homogeneous fields is standard  @xcite ; the discussion above shows that additional dephasing is induced by the field inhomogeneity .",
    "the advantage of having the exact solution for @xmath53 , eq .",
    "( [ moscexact ] ) , at hand is that we can now calculate the field - dependence of such dephasing terms explicitly ; this allows us to make more precise statements than before  @xcite about the regime in which one can expect to observe consequences of the berry phase ( see sec .",
    "[ observability ] below ) .",
    "the magnetoconductance correction @xmath53 is expressed in terms of the cooperon propagator .",
    "the derivation of the cooperon is , in turn , performed within the _",
    "semiclassical limit_. in particular , this means that  back - reaction effects \" , i.e. , non - phase - coherent dynamical effects of the field - dependent zeeman term on the _ orbital motion _ are assumed to be negligibly small throughout .",
    "this is a fundamental assumption in weak - localization theory  @xcite , and it was explicitly adopted in our derivation of the cooperon and of @xmath96 , too .",
    "( this is emphasized , e.g. , in app .",
    "a of ref .  .",
    ")   evidently , dephasing effects such as the ones discussed in the previous subsection are nothing but such back - reaction effects .",
    "thus , if dephasing becomes so large ( as turns out to be the case in the adiabatic limit and for @xmath17 ) that phase - coherence is completely suppressed in the orbital part , the semiclassical approximation breaks down and the self - consistency of the entire treatment is lost  @xcite . consequently , the expressions for the magnetoconductance are no longer reliable in the case of complete dephasing , and no weight should be put on conclusions drawn under such circumstances .",
    "obviously , semiclassical and adiabatic approximations are interconnected issues , in the sense that the semiclassical approximation might break down in the adiabatic limit and for certain field configurations .",
    "in other words , adiabaticity alone is not a sufficient criterion for the observability of berry phase effects , in addition the system must be in the mesoscopic regime characterized by phase - coherence .    to summarize our conclusions so far",
    ", we have seen that our adiabaticity criterion , eq .",
    "( [ adiabaticity ] ) , is sufficient for reaching the adiabatic limit involving the berry phase [ cf .",
    "( [ moscadiabatic ] ) and ( [ mosclsg ] ) ] .",
    "however , the criterion does not guarantee ( and this was never claimed ) that the berry phase will be observable under all circumstances . as a matter of fact",
    ", it can happen that the phase - coherence , which is necessary for observing such quantum phase phenomena , can be destroyed by a variety of dephasing sources , in particular also by magnetic fields penetrating the sample .",
    "if dephasing becomes so strong in the adiabatic regime that quantum phase effects of the orbital motion get completely washed out , the semiclassical approximation underlying the derivation of the cooperon breaks down and results based on it ( such as @xmath53 ) are no longer reliable .",
    "it is precisely the issues discussed in the last two subsections that have not been taken into consideration by van  langen et al .",
    "@xcite . in the light of our discussion",
    "it should now be clear that the only conclusion one can draw from the observation made by van  langen et al .",
    "( namely the non - observability of berry phase effects for @xmath18 within our semiclassical theory ) is that field textures with @xmath17 suppress phase - coherence very efficiently , and thus such extreme textures can not serve as a general test case for the existence of the berry phase and the associated adiabaticity regime  at least not within the semiclassical regime to which our results , eqs .",
    "( [ moscexact])-([mosclsg ] ) , are confined .      up to now",
    "we have mainly concentrated on regimes where @xmath17 .",
    "such regimes , however , are of little experimental interest ( quite apart from the difficulty of how to produce them ) since the berry phase effect would be masked by the strong dephasing effect of the field . the situation , however , is entirely different for the case where the magnetic field winds only once around the ring , i.e. when @xmath16 ( such field textures can be produced experimentally  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , we shall see now that for @xmath16 the dephasing is sufficiently small and the berry phase has observable consequences within an experimentally accessible regime .",
    "we shall illustrate this with two specific examples : first we discuss resonances in the magnetoconductance due to the berry phase ( for vanishing aharonov - bohm flux @xmath98 ) ; then we discuss phase shifts in the aharonov - bohm oscillations induced by the berry phase .",

    "finally , we note that when the tilt angle @xmath41 is varied , then typically there will be a concommittant change of the aharonov - bohm flux @xmath98 .",

    "thus , such fields would have a negligible effect on the inhomogeneous field required for adiabaticity , except if @xmath41 is very close to @xmath138 .",
    "a further experimentally interesting scenario is that of the _ phase shift _ in the aharonov - bohm oscillation induced by the berry phase . in particular , this effect is most pronounced for half - integral berry phases , @xmath139 ( i.e. , @xmath140 or @xmath141 ) , for which we expect [ see eqs .",
    "( [ moscadiabatic ] ) and ( [ mosclsg ] ) ] to get a phase shift in the aharonov - bohm oscillation of the magnetoconductance by the flux value @xmath142 ( i.e. , by one quarter of the flux quantum @xmath143 ) .",
    "note that in this case the sign of the oscillation slope ( e.g. at @xmath120 ) gets reversed with respect to the case without berry phase .",
    "this sign - reversal is reminiscent of similar effects induced by spin - orbit scattering  @xcite ; it is actually not unexpected , as the zeeman term induces an effective spin - orbit coupling due to the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this phase shift is shown in figs .",
    "2a and 2b , which show @xmath144 as function of the aharonov - bohm flux @xmath98 for berry phases @xmath145 and @xmath142 , both in the adiabatic limit ( i.e. , @xmath123 ) and with the choice @xmath146 ( i.e. , @xmath147 ) . for the sake of comparison , in fig .",
    "2d we also show a non - adiabatic case , @xmath148 , for which the phase shift is absent .",
    "the phase shift remains discernible down to about @xmath149 before disappearing .",

    "the amplitude at @xmath123 increases about by 20  percent upon increasing the field to @xmath150 .    to obtain realistic estimates for some physical parameters we now concentrate on a au ring and use the material parameters recently determined by mohanty et al.@xcite ( see sample au-@xmath151 in their table  i ) .",
    "the relevant values are : @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( at a temperature of @xmath154 ) , which give for the dephasing length @xmath155 .",

    "( [ mosclsg ] ) , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "to get roughly the same amplitudes as in @xmath53 we must account for the @xmath41dependent dephasing in @xmath160 . to this end",
    "we choose an effective @xmath161 ( for @xmath162 ) and @xmath163 ( for @xmath140 .",
    "this phenomenological choice is not vital for the qualitative behavior of @xmath160 , but it does allow us to estimate an effective dephasing length @xmath164 , as we now explain .",
    "first we note that the ( peak - to - peak ) amplitude of the magnetoconductance @xmath53 for @xmath165 is considerably reduced ( by about a factor of @xmath166 ) with respect to that for @xmath145 .",
    "as is clear by now , this is due to the @xmath41dependent dephasing terms .",
    "now , without such dephasing the aharonov - bohm amplitudes for @xmath145 and @xmath165 would be equal [ see , e.g. , eq .  ( [ mosclsg ] ) with a @xmath100 that is @xmath41-independent ] . thus , the reduction of the aharonov - bohm amplitude at @xmath140 ( relative to that at @xmath167 ) serves as a quantitative measure of the @xmath41-dependent dephasing .",
    "expressed in terms of an effective dephasing length , @xmath168 , we find @xmath169 m , for the particular values chosen above ( i.e. , @xmath170 , and @xmath157 ) .",
    "this dephasing length should be compared with above value @xmath171 ( corresponding to @xmath146 and @xmath157 ) .    finally , there is also the usual ( spin - independent ) dephasing arising from the field @xmath172 penetrating a ring of finite width @xmath173 . on the one hand , we need a sufficiently large field so as to reach adiabaticity , and on the other hand such a field can induce dephasing . thus , to satisfy these conflicting requirements in an optimal way we should consider rings with a width @xmath173 as small as possible . to get a rough estimate for such a width ,",
    "we take for the field @xmath174 and insert this into the standard formula  @xcite , @xmath175 .",
    "we now require that this dephasing length should not become ( much ) smaller than @xmath107 , so we choose @xmath176 . on the other hand ,",
    "the field required for adiabaticity is about @xmath177 , and together with @xmath178 and @xmath140 this corresponds to a ring width @xmath173 of the order of @xmath179 .",
    "note that as the effective dephasing length is obtained via @xmath180 , the dephasing effect due to @xmath172 penetrating the sample increases @xmath52 by a factor of two ( i.e. , @xmath181 ) . as is seen from fig .  2 , the cases @xmath146 and @xmath181 behave in the same way , i.e. , with phase shift , but the amplitude of @xmath53 for @xmath140 and @xmath181 is now reduced by a factor of @xmath182 compared with @xmath53 for @xmath167 and @xmath146 .",
    "( note that for @xmath167 the magnetic field for the aharonov - bohm oscillations can be chosen to be very small , so that @xmath183 dominates over @xmath184 and thus @xmath146 . )   finally , we note that the field component @xmath174 gives rise to an aharonov - bohm phase @xmath185 that is , in general , not equal to @xmath186 ( with @xmath187 integral ) .",
    "therefore , this offset flux @xmath188 must be accounted for in order to assign the above phase shift unambiguously to the berry phase @xmath165 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath157 , we need @xmath189 in order to generate one flux quantum @xmath81 through the ring .",
    "now consider @xmath140 , and , say , @xmath177 , i.e. , @xmath190 . to compensate the off - set @xmath188 , we need to increase @xmath172 by , say , @xmath191 to @xmath192 , in which case @xmath193 becomes an integer ( @xmath194 ) .    the amplitude - reduction mentioned above demands sufficient experimental resolution , which we now estimate . for the parameter values given above for an au ring and for @xmath140 ,",
    "we find ( cf .  fig .",
    "2c ) that the peak - to - peak amplitude of @xmath53 is about @xmath195 for an effective @xmath181 .",
    "the relative ratio , @xmath196 , thus becomes of the order of @xmath197 for a ring resistance @xmath198 of the order of @xmath199 m ) ohms  @xcite , and @xmath200 m . such sensitivity , as well as all the parameters estimated above , appear to be within present - day experimental reach .",
    "further scenarios for the berry phases in transport can be easily worked out ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "it should be obvious by now that the explicit agreement between @xmath53 in the adiabatic limit and @xmath96 unambiguously demonstrates ( and reinforces the general points made in the previous subsections ) that the adiabaticity criterion , eq .",
    "( [ adiabaticity ] ) , is sufficient for the existence of the berry phase and that , moreover , there exist physical regimes where this berry phase can be observed in magnetoconductance oscillations ( and other quantities ) .",
    "by contrast , the far more stringent criterion eq .",
    "( [ schrott ] ) is certainly not necessary , and therefore sets unwarranted demands on experimental searches for berry phase effects .",
    "we now briefly return to the issue of the source of dephasing in the hamiltonian @xmath201 given in eq .",
    "( [ hfinal ] ) , as well as its physical interpretation . for this purpose",
    "we assume from the outset that we are in the adiabatic regime , @xmath202 , and simply retain the leading contributions when finding the inverse of @xmath203 .",
    "this allows us to identify those terms in the hamiltonian @xmath45 that are responsible for the dephasing .    from the matrix representation  ( [ matrixh ] ) of @xmath201 it is straightforward to see that only those matrix elements are important in the adiabatic limit that are simultaneously either diagonal or off - diagonal in both spin subspaces .",
    "no other matrix elements contribute at the leading order , @xmath204 , for the determinant or sub - determinants of @xmath203 that are necessary to calculate the inverse .",
    "thus we can replace @xmath201 by the matrix @xmath205 and we see that it is only the term @xmath206 in @xmath201 that causes dephasing and leads to those @xmath41-dependent terms in @xmath91 that are absent in @xmath96 ( apart from the differences in @xmath52 and @xmath100 ) .",
    "now , the first term , @xmath207 , has already been identified in the discussion of the exact solution ( for @xmath16 ) for a propagator containing only a single spin-1/2  @xcite . in a general path - integral approach , this term has been interpreted as a consequence of quantum fluctuations : the particle trajectory fluctuates around its classical path and these fluctuations in turn lead to a fluctuating local magnetic field .",
    "such fluctuations , however , violate the standard assumption underlying the adiabatic approximation that the field should vary smoothly as a function of its parameters ( in the present case the parameter is given by the position @xmath208 of the particle on the ring ) .",
    "we have pointed out previously ( see sec .",
    "vi  f in ref .  )",
    "that this term might lead to deviations from the adiabatic approximation , which is valid only for smooth variations .",
    "the second term , @xmath209 , is new , and describes an effective spin - spin interaction induced by the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field ( i.e. , in the cooperon , the path and its time - reversed partner are interacting with each other via their respective spins ) .",
    "this interaction between spin 1 and spin 2 is transmitted via the orbital motion , and in this sense involves a back - reaction of the zeeman term on the orbital motion . however , as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ semiclassical ] , such back reactions that act to suppress the phase - coherence are consistently assumed to be negligible in our semiclassical treatment .",
    "thus , in ref .   we have performed the adiabatic approximation on the propagators for the path and for its time - reversed partner separately and independently , and all possible dephasing effects are included phenomenologically in terms of @xmath100 at the end .",
    "this finally explains the apparent discrepancy between @xmath96 and @xmath91 .",
    "however , as shown in previous sections , this discrepancy vanishes when allowing for @xmath41-dependent dephasing terms @xmath100 in @xmath96 .",
    "by using the exact solution for the cooperon we have shown that the berry phase leads to observable effects in the magnetoconductance oscillation within the adiabatic regime defined by eq .",
    "( [ adiabaticity ] ) .",
    "this is in full agreement with our previous findings  @xcite , and in contrast to the claim made by van  langen et al .",
    "we have pointed out the role of dephasing and emphasized its angle- and winding - dependence .",
    "we have illustrated the general discussion with explicit examples which reinforce our optimistic outlook for the experimental search of the berry phase in diffusive metallic samples .",
    "we wish to acknowledge discussions with s.  van  langen and y.  lyanda - geller .",

    ", we should also allow for the possibility that higher orbital momentum states @xmath69 will contribute to adiabatic behavior ( on the scale given by the thouless energy ) by multiplying the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ adiabaticity ] ) by some momentum average @xmath210 ( see the analogous discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xmath210 can be quite complicated , as it depends in principle on all parameters occurring in the hamiltonian describing the physical situation at hand .",
    "however , typically it turns out that only the lowest few momentum states contribute to physical quantities ( provided the damping is sufficiently small ) ; thus , we will ignore such refinements here and simply put @xmath211 .",
    "we have checked the validity of this approximation ( i.e. @xmath211 ) with the exact solution for the magnetoconductance by testing out when the adiabatic limit is fully reached in the various parameter regimes , and found it to be a reasonable approximation in the present situation ( and for @xmath52 not exceeding @xmath212 ) .",
    "note that the complete berry phase is usually defined as @xmath213 , with @xmath214 the spin value and for constant tilt angle ( cf .",
    "ref .  ) . for two spin-1/2 particles",
    "the total spin @xmath214 is integral .",
    "the berry phase is then equivalent to @xmath215 ( with @xmath216 ) [ see , e.g. , eq .  ( [ mosclsg ] ) ] and we shall simply refer to @xmath89 as the berry phase .",
    "in particular , @xmath145 and @xmath217 are equivalent in their effect , but they belong to different field configurations .      note that the aharonov - bohm resonances in @xmath53 are also suppressed by the @xmath41-dependent dephasing terms , in general , but more gradually than the berry phase resonances , some of which disappear entirely as soon as @xmath17 .",
    "this is related to the fact that the berry phase itself depends on @xmath41 whereas the aharonov - bohm phase does not .",
    "the additional factor of @xmath218 in @xmath219 is intended to provide a phenomenological account of the smaller period with respect to the berry phase in the cooperon resulting from the interference of the path with its time - reversed partner .",
    "for instance , when @xmath162 , one can easily convince oneself that the fluctuations in the individual berry fluxes of spin 1 and spin 2 must exactly cancel each other as the trajectories that the spins describe on the unit sphere in spin space are related by time reversal symmetry .",
    "thus , the dephasing must be reduced at @xmath162 . while certainly plausible , this argument is only of suggestive value , as it ignores the effective interaction between the paths ( see sec .  ) .",
    "also , we ignore for the moment the fact that for @xmath17 such large @xmath52 s actually violate the self - consistency of the semiclassical approximation ( see sec .",
    "[ semiclassical ] ) .",
    "note that if the suppression of phase coherence is only _ partial _ , the treatment is of course still self - consistent within the semiclassical regime .",
    "this is , e.g. , the case for @xmath16 and @xmath140 , for which the berry phase is still visible albeit with a reduced amplitude ( see sec .  ) .",
    "we mention that the presence of magnetic impurities can help bring the adiabatic limit to lower fields . without going into a detailed analysis",
    ", it seems plausible to assume that even for small fields ( say , on the order of tens of gauss ) the magnetic moments of typical impurities will align along the local magnetic field direction ( temperatures should be smaller than the zeeman splitting energy , typically in the sub - kelvin range ) after some relaxation time ( typically on the order of @xmath220 ) .",
    "these magnetic impurities will produce short - ranged local fields that couples via the exchange interaction to the electrons passing by , and thus impart information about the field inhomogeneity on to the electron spin ."
