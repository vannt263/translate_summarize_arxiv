    "for global quotients there is a by now standard approach to constructing stringy products via first pulling back and then pushing forward @xcite . we will call this construction the pull  push , which stands for pull after pushing .",
    "however , going back to @xcite we have used a mechanism that first pushes forward and then pulls back to construct and classify @xmath1frobenius algebra structures . in the same spirit",
    "we call this the push  pull  read push after pulling .",
    "this approach has been very successful for singularities @xcite and for special cases of the group , for instance @xmath2 , see @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that one is left with solving an algebraic co - cycle equation . in many cases",
    "this cocycle is unique up to normalized discrete torsion @xcite .",
    "in fact as we argued in @xcite this mechanism must work if the twisted sectors are cyclic modules over the untwisted sector .",
    "surprisingly a similar technique to ours was used in @xcite where the authors passed to the derham chains and used formal fractional thom forms to study the product .",
    "the goal of this paper is to consolidate these various results :    first , in  [ cyclicsection ] , we show that in the case of cyclic twisted sectors both approaches exist for all the geometric functors considered in @xcite .",
    "this means that our reconstruction program of @xcite ( see also @xcite for a short detailed version ) has a solution .",
    "it actually then has at least discrete torsion many @xcite .",
    "the key in this situation is the existence of sections of the pull ",
    "back maps which allow us to prove the relevant theorems using only the projection formula .",
    "next , in  [ derhamsection ] , we show that in the derham setting , all the elements of the previous study hold up to homotopy , that is up to exact forms . hence we can provide a rigorous setting using thom push  forwards and pull  backs for general global quotients .    in the general setting",
    ", see  [ formalsection ] , there are some obstacles towards a rigorous calculus of pushing forward and then pulling back .",
    "we can make a lot of headway using the excess intersection formula .",
    "but then we have to deal with formal fractional euler classes .",
    "there are two types of these classes .",
    "the first are formal euler classes of negative bundles , to be precise the @xmath3 multiples of the normal bundles of the fixed point sets considered to live in @xmath4theory .",
    "we can make sense of these as formally defining sections and in the situations above these sections coincide with the ones we constructed .",
    "the second type of formal class is that of the fractional euler class of positive , but fractional classes in rational @xmath4theory .",
    "this type of class poses less of a problem and can be treated by adjoining roots to the various rings .",
    "one main result of the formal and rigorous calculations is that in the different situations the classes @xmath5 appearing in the definition of the obstruction bundle produce a co  cycle in the sense of @xcite that is trivialized by them .",
    "this paper came into existence due to the continued interest and questions of yongbin ruan , whom we thank very much .",
    "it also owes a lot to the `` workshop on quantum cohomology of stacks '' at the ihp in feb .",
    "2007 , where these results were first formulated explicitly and presented .",
    "we wish to thank the organizers for the wonderful conference and stimulating atmosphere .",
    "last but not least we also wish to thank takashi kimura for valuable conversations .",
    "will use at least coefficients in @xmath6 if nothing else is stated . for some applications such as derham forms we will use @xmath7 coefficients .",
    "all statements remain valid when passing to @xmath8 .",
    "we will work in the same setup as in the global part of @xcite .",
    "that is we simultaneously treat two flavors of geometry , algebraic and differential . for the latter ,",
    "we consider a stably almost complex manifold @xmath9 with the action of a finite group @xmath1 such that the stably almost complex bundle is @xmath1 equivariant . while for the former @xmath9",
    "is taken to be a smooth projective variety .    in both situations for @xmath10",
    "we denote the fixed point set of @xmath11 by @xmath12 and let @xmath13 be the inertia variety .",
    "we let @xmath14 be any of the functors @xmath15 , that is cohomology , grothendieck @xmath16 , chow ring or topological @xmath4theory with @xmath17 coefficients , and define @xmath18 _",
    "additively_.    we furthermore set @xmath19    notice that on bundles @xmath20 is multiplicative . for general @xmath4theory elements we set @xmath21",

    "we let @xmath40 be the fixed point set of @xmath11 and for a triple @xmath41 such that @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 is the identity of @xmath1 ) we let @xmath44 be the common fixed point set , that is the set fixed under the subgroup generated by them .    in this situation ,",
    "recall the following definitions . fix @xmath39",
    "let @xmath45 be its order .",
    "furthermore let @xmath46 be the sub  bundle of @xmath47 on which @xmath11 acts with character @xmath48 , then @xmath49 notice this formula is invariant under stabilization .",
    "we also wish to point out that using the identification @xmath50 @xmath51 where for an embedding @xmath52 we will use the notation @xmath53 for the normal bundle .",
    "recall from @xcite that in such a situation there is a product on @xmath54 which is given by    @xmath55    where the obstruction bundle @xmath56 can be defined by @xmath57 and the @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the inclusions .",
    "notice , that as it is written @xmath60 only has to be an element of k - theory with rational coefficients , but is actually indeed represented by a bundle @xcite .",
    "the first appearance of a push  pull formula was given in @xcite in terms of a moduli space of maps .",
    "the product was for the @xmath1 invariants , that is for the @xmath32 of the inertia orbifold and is known as chen  ruan cohomology .",
    "in @xcite the obstruction bundle was given using galois covers establishing a product for @xmath32 on the inertia variety level , i.e.  a @xmath1frobenius algebra as defined in @xcite , which is commonly referred to as the fantechi ",

    "the multiplication on the chow ring @xmath31 for the inertia stack was defined in @xcite .",
    "the representation of the obstruction bundle in terms of the @xmath61 and hence the passing to the differentiable setting as well as the two flavors of @xmath4theory stem from @xcite .",
    "the following is the key diagram :    @xmath62    here we used the notation of @xcite , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the inclusion , @xmath65 is the involution which sends the component @xmath12 to @xmath66 using the identity map and @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "this is short hand notation for the general notation of the inclusion maps @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "notice that each @xmath72 is an @xmath71 module in two ways which coincide .",
    "first via the nave product and pull back , i.e.  @xmath73 and secondly via the stringy multiplication @xmath74 . now using ( [ normaleq ] )",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath75",
    "the way the product is defined in ( [ proddefeq ] ) is via first pulling back and then pushing forward using the maps @xmath76 .",
    "the aim of this section is to establish rigorous arguments , that one can also first push  forward and then pull back while using the maps @xmath77 .",
    "this can be done rigorously using sections and the projection formula .",
    "we apply this technique in the current paragraph which treats the cyclic case and in  [ derhamsection ] which is devoted to the derham setting .",
    "we can realize the ( re)construction program of @xcite in two different situations .",
    "first , for any functor @xmath28 as above provided there are sections to the pull  back maps @xmath78 and secondly in a derham setting , where these sections exist on the level of forms .",
