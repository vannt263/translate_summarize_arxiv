    "the understanding of the qcd phase diagram has become one of the most interesting issues in the physics of strong interactions .",
    "such phase diagram is relevant to phenomena in the early universe , in the interior of neutron stars and in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "already in the seventies it was suggested that there should be two distinct phases : a low temperature and density phase in which quarks and gluons are confined within hadrons and chiral symmetry is broken , and a high temperature and density phase ( the so - called quark - gluon plasma ) in which these particles are deconfined and chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "although the possible existence of other phases ( e.g. the color superconducting phase ) was also suggested quite long ago@xcite , this two - phase structure became the standard picture of the qcd phase diagram for more than two decades . in recent years , however , it has been established that at low temperatures and medium densities several other phases might appear ( see e.g. ref.@xcite for recent reviews ) . in particular , for the case of two light flavors it has been shown that there should be a non - negligible region in the qcd phase diagram where strongly interacting matter is a color superconductor ( 2sc phase)@xcite . unfortunately , due to difficulties in dealing with finite chemical potential , ab initio calculations ( as e.g. lattice qcd ) are not yet able to provide a detailed knowledge of the qcd phase diagram@xcite .",
    "thus , most theoretical approaches are based on the use of effective models of qcd . among them",
    ", the nambu - jona - lasinio model@xcite is one of the most popular . in this model",
    "the quark fields interact via local four point vertices which are subject to chiral symmetry .",
    "if such interaction is strong enough , chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken at zero temperature and density , and pseudoscalar goldstone bosons appear .",
    "it has been shown by many authors that when the temperature and/or density increase , the chiral symmetry is restored@xcite . when effective quark - quark interactions are added to the effective lagrangian other phases also appear@xcite . as an improvement on the local njl model ,",
    "some covariant nonlocal extensions have been studied in the last few years@xcite .",
    "nonlocality arises naturally in the context of several successful approaches to low - energy quark dynamics as , for example , the instanton liquid model@xcite and the schwinger - dyson resummation techniques@xcite .",
    "it has been also argued that nonlocal covariant extensions of the njl model have several advantages over the local scheme .",
    "several studies@xcite have shown that these nonlocal models provide a satisfactory description of the hadron properties at zero temperature and density .",
    "recently@xcite , the characteristics of the chiral phase transition have been investigated within this kind of models .",
    "the aim of the present work is to extend such studies to the case in which a superconducting phase can appear .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model and formalism .",
    "our results for some specific nonlocal regulators are presented in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we analyze the dependence of our results on the strength of the diquark correlations . finally , in sec .",
    "v we give our conclusions .",
    "let us begin by stating the euclidean action for the nonlocal chiral quark model in the case of two light flavors and @xmath5 isospin symmetry . for the purpose of the present study it is enough to only consider interactions in the scalar quark - antiquark and quark - quark channels .",
    "thus , one has @xmath6 ^ 2 - \\frac{h}{2}\\ \\left [ \\bar q(x ) \\",
    "i \\gamma_5 \\tau_2 \\lambda_2 \\ q_c(x ) \\right ] \\left [ \\bar q_c(x ) \\",
    "i \\gamma_5 \\tau_2 \\lambda_2 \\ q(x ) \\right ] \\right\\ } \\ , \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the current quark mass and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are pauli and gell - mann matrices corresponding to the flavor and color groups , respectively .",
    "the delocalized quark fields @xmath10 are defined in terms of the quark fields @xmath11 as @xmath12 where the function @xmath13 is a nonlocal regulator .",
    "it can be translated into momentum space , @xmath14 lorentz invariance implies that @xmath15 can only be a function of @xmath16 .",
    "hence we will use for the fourier transform of the regulator the form @xmath17 from now on .",
    "in addition , in eq.([action ] ) we have used @xmath18    the partition function for the model is defined as @xmath19 where the euclidean action at finite temperature @xmath20 and chemical potential @xmath21 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) by going to momentum space and performing the replacement @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the matsubara frequencies corresponding to fermionic modes , @xmath24 . as in ref.@xcite",
    "we are assuming here that the quark interactions only depend on the temperature and chemical potential through the argument of the regulators .",
    "to proceed it is convenient to perform a standard bosonization of the theory .",
    "thus , we introduce the sigma meson field @xmath25 and the scalar diquark field @xmath26 and integrate out the quark fields . in what follows",
    "we will work within the mean field approximation ( mfa ) , in which these bosonic fields are expanded around their vacuum expectation values @xmath27 and @xmath28 and the corresponding fluctuations neglected . within this approximation and employing the nambu - gorkov formalism , the mean field thermodynamical potential per unit volume reads @xmath29 \\label{z}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 stands for the trace over the dirac , flavor , color and nambu - gorkov bispinor indexes .",
    "the inverse propagator @xmath31 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "after some straightforward algebra @xmath35 can be more explicitly expressed as @xmath36 \\right\\ } \\label{omega}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath37 for finite values of the current quark mass , @xmath35 turns out to be divergent .",
    "the regularization procedure used here amounts to define @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the regularized expression for the thermodynamical potential of a free fermion gas , @xmath40 .",
    "\\label{freeomegareg}\\ ] ] the mean field values @xmath41 and @xmath28 are obtained from the coupled pair of gap equations @xmath42 the explicit form of these equations is @xmath43 , \\label{gapeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , in addition to the definitions given in eq.([def1 ] ) , we have used @xmath44 it should be noticed that , in general , there might be regions for which there are more than one solution for each value of @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in such regions we identify the stable solution by requiring it to be an overall minimum of the potential .    given the thermodynamic potential the expressions for all other relevant quantities can be easily derived . for each flavor the quark - antiquark condensate @xmath45 and the quark density @xmath46",
    "are given by @xmath47 in the case of the quark - quark condensate an extra source term @xmath48 has to be added to the effective action .",
    "it is easy to see that this leads to a thermodynamic potential @xmath49 which has the form given in eq.([omega ] ) but where @xmath50 has been replaced by @xmath51 .",
    "then , we get @xmath52 finally , a magnitud which is important to determine the characteristic of the chiral phase transition is the chiral susceptibility @xmath53 . it can be calculated as @xmath54",
    "in this section we concentrate on the numerical results obtained for two different regulators often used in the literature : the gaussian regulator and the lorentzian regulator . in each case",
    "we have considered @xmath55 , @xmath7 and @xmath56 as input parameters fixed so as to reproduce the phenomenological values of the chiral condensate , pion mass and pion decay constant at vanishing temperature and densities@xcite .",
    "moreover , we have set @xmath57 as implied by , for example , oge interactions @xcite .",
    "the dependence of our results on this ratio will be discussed in the following section .      in this case",
    "the regulator is given by @xmath58 where @xmath56 plays the role of a cut - off parameter .",
    "we have considered two different sets of parameters .",
    "set i corresponds to @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 while set ii to @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "although for both sets the zero temperature and density properties mentioned above are well reproduced , in the case of set i the quark propagator has no purely real poles while for set ii it does .",
    "thus , following ref.@xcite , set i might be interpreted as a confining one , since quarks can not materialize on - shell in minkowski space",
    ".    the mean field values @xmath41 and @xmath28 as a function of @xmath21 and @xmath20 are obtained by numerically solving eqs.([gapeq ] ) .",
    "the corresponding results as a function of @xmath21 for various values of @xmath20 are displayed in fig.[unos ] , where left panels correspond to set i while right ones to set ii .",
    "it can be seen that , for small values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( full lines in fig.[unos ] ) , the system is in the chiral phase for which @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "if we increase @xmath21 keeping @xmath20 fixed , at some critical value of @xmath21 there is sudden drop of @xmath67 and a simultaneous sudden increase in @xmath68 so that we get into the 2sc phase characterized by @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in particular",
    ", the values of the diquark gap at the critical chemical potential and @xmath71 can be found in table 1 .",
    "if we repeat the process with a higher value of @xmath20 something similar happens until we reach the  triple point \" ( 3p ) . for temperatures slightly higher than @xmath72 ( dashed lines in fig.[unos ] )",
    "the sudden drop in @xmath67 and the increase @xmath68 start to happen at two different values of @xmath21 . between these values of @xmath21",
    "we have @xmath69 and @xmath66 .",
    "moreover there is no discontinuity in the behavior of @xmath68 as a function of @xmath21 . for temperatures above the  end point \" ( ep ) the discontinuity in @xmath67 also disappears ( dotted lines in fig.[unos ] ) . finally for temperatures above the critical temperature for @xmath73 , @xmath74",
    ", we get @xmath75 for all values of @xmath21 . in the region",
    "corresponding to the crossover the transition point is defined by the point at which the chiral susceptibility @xmath53 has a maximum .",
    "the positions of the different critical points are summarized in table 1 .",
    "also shown in fig.[unos ] are the corresponding quiral @xmath76 and diquark @xmath77 condensates .",
    "their behavior is quite similar to those of the mean field values @xmath41 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the fact that the chiral condensate approaches some positive value for large values of @xmath21 is due to the substraction scheme used to regularize the thermodynamical potential , eq.([omegareg ] ) .",
    "in fact , it is not difficult to see that for finite values of @xmath7 the regularized free thermodynamical potential @xmath39 , eq.([freeomegareg ] ) , has such behavior .",
    "the corresponding phase diagrams are displayed in fig.[dos ] .",
    "again left panels correspond to set i and right ones to set ii . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper panels correspond to the phase diagrams in the @xmath0 plane and the lower ones to the diagrams in the @xmath78 plane , where the nuclear matter density @xmath79 . in all the cases",
    "we have indicated with full lines the first order transition lines , with dashed lines the second order transition lines and with dotted lines the lines corresponding to the crossover between the chiral phase and the weakly interacting quark phase .",
    "as it is clear from the @xmath0 phase diagrams , at the triple point the three phases can coexist .",
    "it is interesting to remark that for values of the chemical potential below @xmath80 the transition line ( both the first order and crossover sections ) coincides exactly with that obtained in the absence of diquark correlations ( @xmath81 ) . on the other hand",
    ", for @xmath82 the first order transition line is different from that obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "this is more clearly seen in the corresponding @xmath78 diagrams .",
    "there we have indicated with dash - dotted line the first order transition line corresponding to @xmath81 . as we observed the existence of diquark correlations increases the size of the mixed phase",
    ". note that for @xmath83 such mixed phase is composed by the chiral and 2sc phases while for @xmath84 it is a mixture of the chiral and the free quark gas phases .    as for the comparison between the results of set",
    "i and ii , we see that they are qualitatively very similar , with only small quantitative differences in the position of the critical points .",
    "the lorentzian regulator we have considered has the form @xmath85 the input parameters are @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "once again , we have solved the gap equations for different values of the temperature and chemical potential .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the mean field values and condensates is very similar to that found using the gaussian regulator ( fig.[unos ] ) and , thus , will not be explicitly shown .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to note that , as shown in table 1 , in this case the @xmath71 diquark gap at the critical chemical potential @xmath89 is somewhat smaller .",
    "the corresponding phase diagrams in the @xmath0 and @xmath78 planes are displayed in fig.[tres ] . as in the previous cases ,",
    "we observe the existence of an  end point \" , at which the first order chiral phase transition line becomes a crossover line , and a triple point at which the three phases co - exist .",
    "the position of these points , which are quite similar to those of the gaussian regulator set ii , are given in table 1 .",
    "in the previous section we have assumed @xmath90 as favored by various effective models of quark - quark interactions . however , this value is subject to rather large uncertainties .",
    "in fact , so far there is no strong phenomenological constrain on the ratio @xmath91 .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to explore the consequences of varying @xmath91 in the range @xmath92 .",
    "larger values of this ratio are quite unlikely to be realized in qcd and might lead to color symmetry breaking in the vacuum . since the results obtained above for different regulators are qualitatively very similar in what follows we will only consider the gaussian regulator with the set of parameters set ii .    for values of @xmath91 in the range @xmath93 the resulting phase diagrams look qualitatively similar to the one displayed in fig.[dos ] , although the details ( in particular the position of the critical points , see below ) do depend on @xmath91 . for @xmath94",
    "there is a qualitative change since the triple point ceases to exist . in this case , even at very low temperatures , as we increase @xmath21 at some point we find a first order phase transition between the chiral phase and the free quark gas phase . for values slightly above this critical @xmath21",
    "we have @xmath95 .",
    "if we continue to increase @xmath21 we find a second order phase transition between the free quark gas phase and the 2sc phase .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 phase diagram is shown in the upper panel of fig.[cinco ] .",
    "note that in this phase diagram the transition line between the chiral and the free quark gas phases ( both its crossover and first order sections ) coincides exactly to the one obtained for @xmath81 .",
    "for @xmath96 the situation is again qualitatively different , since in such range the triple point and the end point merge together .",
    "in fact , as @xmath91 comes closer from below to @xmath97 the first order transition line that connects the 3p and the ep becomes shorter and shorter and at this particular value it disappears .",
    "moreover , for @xmath96 there is small region at low temperatures at which both @xmath41 and @xmath28 take non - vanishing values .",
    "this region is separated from the chiral phase by a second order transition line and from the 2sc for a first order transition line .",
    "this situation is illustrated in the lower panel of fig.[cinco ] where the @xmath0 phase diagram for @xmath98 is shown .",
    "the possible existence of this type of phase was already noticed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the behavior of the critical points as function of @xmath91 is displayed in fig.[seis ] . in the upper panel",
    "we show the position of critical chemical potential @xmath99 at @xmath71 .",
    "the full line indicates the first order @xmath99 while the dashed line the second order one . in the range",
    "@xmath93 we have only a first order @xmath99 . for values below such @xmath99",
    "the system is in the chiral phase while for values above is in the 2sc . for values",
    "@xmath94 we have that the second order @xmath99 , i.e. the point at which the second order transition line that separates the 2sc and free quark gas phases meets the @xmath21-axis in the @xmath0 phase diagram , grows rather fast as @xmath91 decreases , signaling the almost disappearance of the 2sc phase for very small values of the diquark coupling constant . for @xmath96",
    "a second order @xmath99 appears again , but now _ below _ the first order @xmath99 .",
    "thus , between these two critical chemical potentials we have @xmath100 _ and _ @xmath101 . in the lower panel",
    "we display the position of the triple and end points as functions of @xmath91 .",
    "note that the temperature scale is given to the right while the chemical potential scale is given to the left . for values of @xmath94 only the the ep exists .",
    "its positions remains independent of the diquark coupling constant up to @xmath97 where it meets the 3p , that appears at @xmath102 and which position in temperature ( chemical potential ) increases ( decreases ) as @xmath91 increases . for values of @xmath96",
    "both critical points transform into a single one which position in temperature ( chemical potential ) increases ( decreases ) as @xmath91 increases .",
    "in this work we have studied the finite temperature and chemical potential behavior of @xmath103 chiral quark models with nonlocal covariant separable interactions in both the scalar quark - antiquark and quark - quark channels . in our numerical calculations",
    "we have considered two types of regulators : the gaussian regulator and the lorentzian regulator . in all these cases",
    "we have set the model parameters so as to reproduce the empirical values of the pion mass and decay constant and to get a chiral quark condensate in reasonable agreement to that determined from lattice gauge theory or qcd sum rules . as for the ratio between quark - quark and quark - antiquark interactions @xmath91",
    "which is not well constrained by phenomenology , we have in principle adopted the standard value @xmath90 which follows from some models of the qcd interactions .",
    "we find that in all cases the phase diagram is quite similar .",
    "in particular , we obtain that for two light flavors there are always two critical points : a  triple point \" at which the second order transition line separating the 2sc and normal phases meets the first order transition line which separate the chiral and 2sc phases at low temperatures ; an  end point \" which appears at higher temperatures and at which the first order transition line becomes a crossover line .",
    "of course , there is also a critical temperature @xmath104 above which the chiral condensate always vanishes .",
    "as displayed in table 1 the values of @xmath104 are in the range @xmath105 mev , that is somewhat below the values obtained in modern lattice simulations which suggest @xmath106  mev@xcite . with this in mind",
    "we note that our predictions for the positions of the triple and end points are very similar for all the cases considered . perhaps , the only noticeable difference between the different cases is the prediction for the @xmath71 diquark gap at the critical chemical potential , where we find values that range from 114 to 182 mev .",
    "these values are larger than those obtained within models with instantaneous interactions @xcite . it should be noticed ( see fig.[unos ] ) that in the present case the diquark gap also registers a stronger increase with @xmath21 after the phase transition .",
    "this leads to rather large values of the gap for chemical potentials of the order of 400 mev , above which strange degrees of freedom have to be taken into account .",
    "consequently , for such values of @xmath21 , we also get larger values ( 100 - 120 mev ) for the critical temperature needed to go to the free quark gas phase , as it can be easily seen comparing our phase diagrams with those obtained in e.g. the njl model@xcite .",
    "in the final part of this work we have explored the consequences of varying @xmath91 in the range @xmath92 .",
    "given the similarity of the results obtained for the two regulators mentioned above we have considered here only the gaussian regulator with the set of parameters set ii .",
    "we found that for @xmath94 there is no triple point .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath96 the triple and end point merge and a phase where both the chiral and diquark condensates are non - negligible appears .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the value @xmath97 is quite close to the standard one @xmath107 used in most model calculations .",
    "thus , it would be important to sort out possible phenomenological consequences of having quark matter with a phase diagram in which the 3p and ep coincide .    in this work",
    "we have neglected the strangeness degrees of freedom . to go beyond the values of chemical potential",
    "considered here and , thus , study for example the color flavor locked phase in the context of models with non local interactions their effect have to be included .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
