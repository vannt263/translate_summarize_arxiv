    "the multiple production of particles in high energy collisions received a lot of attention during many years . a renewal interest in this topic originated recently with the beginning of operation of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "among first results obtained at the lhc were multiplicity measurements in proton - proton collisions .",
    "the cms , alice , and atlas collaborations provided valuable and precise data on multiplicity distributions ( md ) of the charged hadrons in the new super high energy domain .",
    "the study of multiparticle production can give important information about parton processes and transitions of the colored partons to the colorless hadrons .",
    "the complex phenomena that influence md are however very hard to describe in detail , because we can not formulate the multiparton process in terms of its qcd theory .",
    "most of the particles which contribute to the multiplicity buildup are soft particles and a perturbative approximation is inapplicable here .",
    "second , hadronization should be somehow taken into account which is far of being understood properly .",
    "the natural and probably most economical approach is to look for empirical relations and regularities .    the study of particle production as a function of multiplicity has revealed a very popular koba - nielsen - olesen ( kno ) scaling @xcite . in @xmath0 collisions ,",
    "the scaling in the full phase - space holds up to the highest energy of the cern intersecting storage rings ( isr ) but it is clearly violated @xcite in the energy region of the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) collider and beyond .",
    "the strong violation of kno scaling was observed also at the energy @xmath3  tev in the limited pseudorapidity intervals @xmath4 though for small pseudorapidity windows @xmath5 the scaling is approximately valid @xcite .",
    "a related phenomenon is the so - called negative binomial regularity , which is the occurrence of the negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) in different interactions over a wide range of the collision energies .",
    "the ua5 collaboration showed that md in the non - single - diffractive ( nsd ) @xmath0 collisions can be described by nbd up to the energy @xmath6  gev both in the full phase - space @xcite and in symmetric pseudorapidity windows @xcite .",
    "analysis of data on md measured by the alice collaboration indicates @xcite that nbd describes the data in the small pseudorapidity window @xmath7 up to the energy @xmath8  gev . besides @xmath0 collisions ,",
    "nbd has been applied to various systems including @xmath1 annihilations .",
    "much effort has been made to explain the negative binomial form of md observed in many situations , however , its physical origin has not been fully understood @xcite .",
    "the shape of md of particles produced in hadron - hadron collisions at high energies is quite different .",
    "the full phase - space data on charged particle multiplicities obtained from the nsd events in @xmath9 collisions at @xmath10  gev @xcite indicated that besides kno , the negative binomial regularity is violated as well .",
    "the measurements of md at the energy @xmath11  gev by the e735 collaboration @xcite at the fermilab tevatron showed even stronger deviation of data from nbd .",
    "though with large mutual discrepancies at high multiplicities , both data demonstrate a narrow peak at the maximum and some structure around @xmath12 . despite its correct qualitative behaviour ,",
    "the single nbd is not sufficient to describe the experimental data .",
    "a systematic study of the complex form of md was performed in the framework of two component model @xcite and its three component modification @xcite .",
    "there exist also other approaches to explanation of the observed features of particle production at high energies ( for a review see ref .",
    "new interest in this field is motivated by the recent results of the multiplicity measurements in @xmath2 collisions at the lhc .",
    "the data obtained by the cms @xcite , alice @xcite , and atlas @xcite collaborations show similar structure in md of charged particles produced in the limited windows in pseudorapidity .",
    "the measurements allow to study evolution of the distinct peak at maximum and the broad shoulder at large @xmath13 both with the collision energy and pseudorapidity .",
    "in this paper we propose an alternative phenomenological approach to the description of md in @xmath0 and @xmath14 collisions . using the same concept for hadron and lepton interactions , we try to account for the structure in data which emerges in the @xmath0 interactions at high energies .",
    "the proposed four parametric representation of md is motivated by a scenario of the parton cascading .",
    "the considerations behind are based on a premise that dynamics of the particle production as manifested on the level of multiplicities can be described in terms of a stochastic cascading with specific types of the underlying processes .",
    "the construction includes the processes of parton immigration and absorption together with two and three parton incremental and decremental recombination .",
    "the recombination processes are assumed in the final stage of the parton evolution during the color neutralization .",
    "the transition to the colorless hadrons is considered in a stationary regime at breakdown of the confinement and onset of hadronization .",
    "the number of particles created in high energy collisions varies from event to event .",
    "the distributions of probabilities @xmath15 of occurrence of the multiplicity @xmath13 provide sensitive means to probe dynamics of the interaction . besides general characteristics of particle production the distributions contain information about multiparticle correlations in an integrated form .",
    "the correlations of the final particles reflect features of hadronization mechanism and properties of the qcd parton evolution just before hadronization .",
    "the data on md of charged particles from the high energy @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions allow us to study the processes underlying the multiple production and its correlation structure within a phenomenological framework of parton cascading .",
    "the extraction of information on these processes requires the elementary charge conservation to be taken into account . in our approach",
    "we investigate and exploit md of charged particle pairs and characterize it by a recurrence relation between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this assumes connection between the collisions of multiplicities @xmath17 with @xmath17 collisions of multiplicity @xmath13 which can be written in the form @xmath18 the class of md defined by expression of this type has been considered with a view to stimulated emission and cascading in ref .",
    "the independent emission of particles represented by poisson distribution is characterized by @xmath19 .",
    "the constancy of @xmath20 means that creation of an additional particle is independent of number of other particles .",
    "the stimulated emission of identical bosons obeying bose - einstein statistics follows geometric distribution for which one has @xmath21 .",
    "this means that emission probability of a boson is enhanced by a factor @xmath17 when @xmath13 bosons are already present in the system .",
    "both examples are special cases of nbd given by the formula @xmath22 the distribution depends on two parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 for which the recurrence relation ( [ eq : r1 ] ) is given by the linear dependence @xmath25 for fixed @xmath26 , the poisson distribution is recovered with @xmath27 .",
    "the geometric distribution corresponds to @xmath28 .",
    "chew et al .",
    "proposed @xcite a generalization of nbd which gives good description of md of charged particles in @xmath14 annihilation @xcite .",
    "the generalized multiplicity distribution ( gmd ) has the form @xmath29 the distribution is function of three parameters @xmath30 , @xmath24 , and @xmath31 .",
    "the expression for @xmath20 in this case reads @xmath32 the formula for gmd reduces to the expression for nbd , when @xmath33 . for @xmath34",
    ", gmd becomes furry - yule distribution ( fyd ) proposed by hwa and lam @xcite .",
    "the mentioned distributions are fully determined by the functional form of @xmath20 together with the general normalization condition to unity .",
    "the normalization is guaranteed for @xmath35 by the linear dependence of @xmath20 at large multiplicities with @xmath36 . in the parton cascade picture of multiple production",
    "the parameters of these distributions can be related with the rate constants of branching processes in the evolution equations for probabilities .",
    "0.8 cm      in a high energy collision with the creation of a multiparticle state the dynamics of the system can be simulated as a parton cascading associated with quark and gluon interactions during the interaction time .",
    "the corresponding parton cascade processes inspired by the elementary perturbative qcd are of three types : a/ parton - parton collisions , b/ branching processes such as quark bremsstrahlung , gluon self interaction or gluon splitting , c/ fusion processes e.g. gluon annihilation on a quark . practically all qcd - based models of many - body production involve some form of cascading .",
    "the stochastico - physical picture of the multiplicity evolution can be described by kolmogorov - chapman differential - difference ( dd ) rate equations @xcite for the probability @xmath37 .",
    "the continuous parameter @xmath38 is usually interpreted as an ordering parameter , qcd evolution parameter , or time .",
    "the rate equations were applied to hadron physics many years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite . soon afterwards",
    ", the properties of md were studied by solving dd equations in terms of parton cascading by number of people @xcite . in particular , all possible qcd vertices were taken into account in ref .",
    "@xcite . stationary regime in birth and death processes with recombination ( confluence ) of two ( @xmath39 ) and three ( @xmath40 ) gluons has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we point out and exploit somewhat different strategy .",
    "we try to establish minimal number of such processes in the cascade picture of particle production which could account for both the general character of md and its complex structure observed at high energies . a successful description of experimental data requires essential features of the cascade evolution to be introduced into the phenomenology .",
    "we attempt to estimate those features which mostly influence the building structure of md at high energies .",
    "this involves processes of parton recombinations at the end of the cascade just near breakdown of the confinement .",
    "the last phase of the parton evolution is considered to have large impact on the form of md of the produced hadrons .",
    "we suppose that in the final stage there exists some kind of a stationary regime which occurs at the transition between parton and hadron degrees of freedom . in this regime",
    ", soft partons intensively exchange their momenta to reach an `` momenta uniformity '' before their conversion into observable particles @xcite .    in order to introduce features of parton recombination into a multiplicity description ,",
    "we consider a stationary regime of dd equations of kolmogorov - chapman type .",
    "hereafter we refer to the partons as objects which cascade in `` time '' and regard the terms particle and parton as interchangeable .",
    "the binary parton - parton scatterings do not change the number of particles during the system evolution but can influence neutralization or screening of the color flow .",
    "they can act as supporting processes which initiate branching or fusion of the nearby partons .",
    "such connection represents multiparton interactions contributing to a change of the particle number by one .",
    "the simplest interactions of this type are recombinations of two or three particles . here",
    "we consider the process of two parton incremental recombination ( @xmath41 ) together with three parton incremental ( @xmath42 ) and three parton decremental ( @xmath43 ) recombination processes .",
    "the confluence of two and three partons , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , is supposed to be negligible with respect to other recombination processes at the end of the cascade . together with the particle production that depends on particles already produced , we consider independent immigration ( @xmath44 ) and absorption ( @xmath45 ) as another source of partons influenced by bulk properties of the system created in the collision .",
    "the accumulated energy is transformed into partons in this manner , or on the contrary a parton can be melted and absorbed by the expanding system again . in the case of independence of each cascade process , the corresponding dd evolution equations for the probability @xmath37 read @xmath46 the coefficients @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the corresponding rates for the processes @xmath44 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "similar parameters for degradation of the particle number in the processes @xmath45 and @xmath43 are denoted as @xmath50 and @xmath51 . using the definition of the generating function @xmath52 we rewrite the system of dd equations ( [ eq : r6 ] ) in terms of @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding stationary solution @xmath54 satisfies the third order differential equation @xmath55 a regular solution of this equation is proportional to the generalized hypergeometric function @xmath56 the complex constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 are given in terms of the real parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the ratio ( [ eq : r1 ] ) is given as follows @xmath59 this recurrence relation together with the normalization condition for @xmath15 fully determines the formula for md which we refer to as the generalized hypergeometric distribution ( ghd ) .",
    "the distribution depends on four parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 which are ratios of the rate constants for the corresponding cascade processes .    in the next section",
    "we exploit ghd to describe md of the charged particles produced in @xmath0 and @xmath14 interactions . the formula ( [ eq : r10 ] )",
    "has various limits applicable for both reactions at different energies and phase space regions .",
    "if @xmath64 and @xmath65 simultaneously , ghd reduces to nbd . in that case",
    "@xmath20 is given by ( [ eq : r3 ] ) with the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "on the contrary , if @xmath47 and @xmath50 are both large enough relative to other parameters , a poisson - like peak appears in md at small @xmath13 for which @xmath68 .",
    "there exists a region where ghd can be narrower than poisson distribution .",
    "this happens at low energies where the rate constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 are small or even vanish .",
    "the statistics of the charged particle md is governed by the requirements of conservation laws in each collision . due to the global charge conservation , there are only even multiplicities when dealing with experimental data in the full phase - space . on the other hand",
    "the charge conservation can not be satisfied by the stochastic processes which are independent of the charge .",
    "in particular , ghd , as defined for all non - negative integer values of @xmath13 , can not directly represent the full phase - space data on multiplicities which are always even .",
    "there are two main conceptions how to tackle the problem .",
    "according to the often used procedure @xcite , the probabilities for only even integers @xmath13 are taken from a theoretical distribution , then are renormalized and compared to the measured values of @xmath15 .",
    "the second approach assumes to deal with md of particle pairs and compare it to a theoretical distribution for all values of @xmath13 .",
    "both methods give different values of the parameters entering the distribution and differ also in capability of description of experimental data . here",
    "we use the second method and apply ghd and nbd ( for comparison ) to the distribution of particle pairs .",
    "we have analysed experimental data on md of charged particles produced in the non - single - diffractive ( nsd ) @xmath0 collisions in the full phase - space .",
    "the analysis was performed with the high energy data measured by the e735 collaboration @xcite at @xmath69 , 1000 , 546 , and 300  gev , by the ua5 collaboration @xcite at @xmath70 and 200  gev , and by the abcdhw collaboration @xcite at @xmath71 , 53 , 45 , and 30  gev .",
    "the study includes also the fnal fixed target data @xcite at @xmath72 , 23.8 , 19.7 , and 13.8  gev corrected for diffraction cross sections @xcite , the serpukhov data at @xmath73  gev @xcite with diffraction corrections @xcite and the low energy cern data @xcite measured by the bhm collaboration at @xmath74 and 4.9  gev .",
    "the results of the analysis with the cern - minuit program are shown in table i and in figs . 1 - 2 .",
    "as can be seen from table i , the description of md of particle pairs by nbd is in most cases unsatisfactory including the data from isr and lower energies .",
    "though md of the charged particles can be approximated by nbd up to the energy @xmath75  gev pretty well , nbd is not able to account fully for the narrower distribution of the particle pairs . at the energies lower than @xmath76",
    "gev , the distribution becomes even narrower than poisson distribution .",
    "this corresponds to negative values of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath77 , meaning that nbd transforms to a binomial one ."
