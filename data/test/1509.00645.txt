    "with the rapid growth in demand for higher data rates , wireless technology is shifting towards the systems with multiple antennas .",
    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems in wireless communications provide significant improvements in wireless link reliability and the achievable capacity @xcite .",
    "recently , the systems with large number of antennas ( tens to hundreds of antennas ) called as _ large - mimo _ systems are getting increased attention @xcite because they provide additional multiplexing and diversity gains . using spatial multiplexing in mimo systems ,",
    "multiple data streams can be transmitted simultaneously from different transmit antennas . however , the detection of these data streams at the receiver end is challenging . to achieve minimum bit error rate ( ber ) performance in mimo systems , an exhaustive search over all the possible transmit vectors",
    "is required .",
    "this is called as the maximum likelihood ( ml ) search for symbol vector detection in mimo systems . however , as the number of antennas grow , the number of possible transmit vectors also increases exponentially and thus the ml search becomes computationally impractical .",
    "sphere decoder , a well known mimo detector achieves near ml performance but is practical only up to limited number of dimensions @xcite .",
    "+ the traditional mimo detection techniques involve linear detection such as zero forcing ( zf ) detector and minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) detector .",
    "these detectors use linear transformation of the received vector in order to estimate the transmitted symbol vector .",
    "comparatively the mmse detector is superior over zf detector in terms of ber performance , but still their performance is far inferior compared to the ml performance .",
    "another type of detection involve non - linear detectors such as vertical bell labs layered space time architecture ( v - blast ) @xcite which utilizes ordered sic for symbol vector detection .",
    "some of the other mimo detection technique involve ant colony optimization based mimo detection @xcite , message passing based algorithm @xcite , channel hardening based algorithm @xcite , and lattice reduction aided mimo detection @xcite .",
    "as an alternative , in this study we employ sic based detection technique for mimo detection problem . + sic based mimo detection is a well known detection technique where symbols are detected sequentially @xcite . in sic , after detecting each symbol , its interference is canceled from the received vector in order to improve the instantaneous signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) for the remaining symbols .",
    "it is also known as layered detection where in each layer , one symbol is detected .",
    "however , it suffers from error propagation which occur due to wrong decisions in early stages of the algorithm @xcite . for improving the performance of sic , a well known technique known as v - blast @xcite technique",
    "is used which performs the following steps : ( 1 ) snr based ordering in the detection sequence , ( 2 ) using zf or mmse for nulling the interference among the data streams and ( 3 ) detecting a symbol and canceling its interference i.e. sic .",
    "further , to mitigate the effect of error propagation , one of the available algorithms in the literature include multi - branch sic ( mb - sic ) algorithm @xcite where the concept of multiple branch ( mb ) processing is utilized .",
    "each branch of mb - sic differs in ordering of the detection sequence thus resulting in a higher detection diversity over the conventional sic . recently , a multiple feedback ( mf ) strategy is proposed in @xcite for sic based mimo detection .",
    "multiple feedback sic ( mf - sic ) algorithm proposed in @xcite is based on the concept of shadow are constraint ( sac ) where if the decision fall in the shadow region ( unreliability region ) then multiple constellation points are used in the decision feedback loop . the best symbol from the multiple symbols used in the decision feedback",
    "is selected using the ml criteria .",
    "+ in this article , we propose an improved multiple feedback successive interference cancellation ( imf - sic ) for symbol vector detection in mimo spatial multiplexing systems . in mf - sic , once a decision falls into the shadow region , conventional sic is used to find the best one symbol for the corresponding layer .",
    "however , it may happen that while computing the best symbol for a given layer , multiple decisions from the subsequent layers fall into the shadow region .",
    "this condition is not checked in mf - sic which sometimes results in error propagation and limits the ber performance . in improved mf - sic ( imf - sic )",
    ", we overcome this limitation by checking the shadow region criteria recursively rather than using the conventional sic for searching the best candidate symbol .",
    "this results in significant reduction in error propagation and thus the ber performance can be improved . also , we propose an ordered imf - sic ( oimf - sic ) algorithm where we employ the log likelihood ratio ( llr ) based dynamic ordering in the detection sequence @xcite . by the term",
    "dynamic ordering we mean that after every successful decision about a symbol , the ordering of the detection sequence is updated based on new llr values . in oimf - sic , same ordering pattern is followed even for searching the best symbol when a decision is found unreliable .",
    "simulation results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the conventional sic and the mf - sic based detection methods , and that they achieve a near ml performance .",
    "+ rest of the article is organized as follows . in sect .",

    "we consider a point to point spatially multiplexed mimo link with @xmath0 transmit antennas and @xmath1 receive antennas . in spatial multiplexing",
    ", each antenna transmits a different information symbol @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4^t$ ] be the @xmath5 dimensional transmit vector , @xmath6^t$ ] denote the transpose of a matrix .",
    "each entry @xmath2 of the transmit vector @xmath7 is taken from a signal constellation @xmath8 , for example @xmath9 for 4-qam signaling .",
    "the channel over which the symbol vector @xmath7 is transmitted is assumed to be a rayleigh distributed flat fading channel .",
    "let us consider an @xmath10 complex channel matrix @xmath11 with its elements @xmath12 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) as complex normal with mean 0 and variance 1 i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "the received symbol vector @xmath16 , after demodulation and matched filtering can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with its element @xmath19 for @xmath13 as i.i.d .",

    "the channel state information ( csi ) is assumed to be perfectly known at the receiver but is unknown at the transmitter .",
    "the ml solution for a given received vector @xmath16 and a known channel matrix @xmath11 can be found as @xmath28 ml detection ( mld ) requires an exhaustive search over @xmath29 possible transmit symbol vectors where @xmath30 is cardinality of the constellation set @xmath8 .",
    "this search grows exponentially with increase in the modulation order ( @xmath30 ) or increase in the number of transmit antennas ( @xmath0 ) or both .",
    "in this section , we discuss some of the traditional mimo detection techniques such as linear detection techniques which involve zero forcing ( zf ) based mimo detection and minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) based mimo detection , and nonlinear detection techniques such as sic based mimo detection .      in zf based mimo detection , a linear transformation matrix @xmath31 is used in such a way that it removes the effect due to the channel impairments on the received vector @xmath16 i.e. @xmath32 which is the pseudo inverse of channel matrix @xmath11 .",

    "the computational complexity of zf receiver is very less , however the ber performance is far inferior to the ml performance .",
    "the main drawback of zf based mimo detection is the problem of noise enhancement which degrades its performance .",

    "thus it achieves better ber performance over zf but still the performance of mmse receiver is inferior as compared to the ml performance .",
    "one more drawback is that the mmse solution needs knowledge of the noise variance @xmath24 .      in sic based mimo detection ,",
    "the symbols transmitted from different transmit antennas are detected in a sequential manner .",
    "after detecting a symbol for a particular transmit antenna , its interference is canceled from the received vector in order to reduce the interference between different data streams at the receiver .",

    "the conventional sic suffers from the problem of error propagation which degrades the ber performance . as a solution to mitigate the effect of error propagation , mf strategy has been proposed in @xcite for sic based mimo detection .",
