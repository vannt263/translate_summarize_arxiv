    "the charge of weak polyacids and polybases is determined by the probability of each functional group to dissociate and expose a charged residue .",
    "this probability depends on a chemical equilibrium which can be tuned by varying the ph of the solution .",
    "in contrast to dilute solutions of monoacids or monobases , in weak polyelectrolytes ( pes ) each functional group is influenced by all other groups along the polymer , via their mutual electrostatic interaction . as a result of the repulsion between charged groups ,",
    "even strong pes become weak at low salt concentrations . furthermore , when two or more polymers interact with each other , their degree of ionization is modified , compared to their isolated state , and depends on parameters such as the distance between the polymers and their relative spatial configuration . due to the many - body nature of this problem , and the long range of the electrostatic interactions , an exact solution for the average charge as function of ph is generally not known .    in this paper",
    "we consider stiff pes , where there is no coupling between the dissociation degree of freedom and the polymer conformation ( for treatment of such coupling in flexible pes see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider first a single pe in salt solution and discuss some of the approximations commonly used to characterize its charge regulation .",
    "it was previously shown that a uniform mean field approach can not adequately describe charge regulation when the coupling between charges along the polymer is strong @xcite . in these cases",
    "ionizable groups dissociate in a two - step process , characterized by a plateau in the charge _ vs. _ ph curve .",
    "this process results from a spatially inhomogeneous charging pattern and is not predicted by a uniform mean field approach .",
    "we introduce a mean field theory with explicit symmetry breaking between two sublattices .",
    "such an approximation is shown to be semi - quantitatively accurate and performs better than previous calculations where the range of interactions is restricted @xcite , as we demonstrate by comparison with exact enumeration over all configurations for finite chain lengths .    in the second part of the paper",
    "we apply our non - uniform mean - field scheme to the interaction of two stiff pes . we restrict ourselves to the simple case of polymers aligned parallel to each other and",
    "calculate the average charging and free energy as function of their distance .",
    "our model reveals some of the intricate effects that can occur in interacting weak pes . in a broader context , these interactions are of interest in the formation of pe multilayers , composed of alternating layers of positively and negatively charged polymers @xcite . in particular weak polyacids and polybases can be used to form multilayers @xcite . in this case properties such as",
    "the layer thickness and density depend strongly on the dissociation degree of the functional groups , and can be tuned sensitively by varying the ph of the solution @xcite .",
    "the free energy for a weak pe , immersed in an aqueous ionic solution , can be written as follows : @xmath0 the hamiltonian @xmath1 is given by : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the position of the @xmath4th monomer and @xmath5 can be either zero ( for an uncharged monomer ) or one ( charged monomer ) . the sum in eq .",

    "the main reason for resorting to linear theory is that only at that level can the complicated problem of spatially inhomogeneous charge distributions on the pe backbone be calculated .",
    "one justification is that weak polyelectrolytes as studied in this paper are typically not strongly charged , so that non - linear effects are less important than for strong polyelectrolytes , as will be discussed in more detail in the concluding section .    for the following calculations ,",

    "we will assume that the polymer is long compared to the debye length .",
    "however , it is important to realize that for shorter polymers the average degree of dissociation depends on the polymer length . in order to demonstrate this point",

    "note that the combination @xmath75 , which determines the solution without symmetry breaking , is smaller in the nn case than in full interaction case . on the other hand the combination @xmath55 , which affects the symmetry breaking ( see eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) ) , is larger in the nn case .    in fig .",
    "2 we compare the nn predictions ( dashed lines and open symbols ) with those obtained using the full long - range interaction ( solid lines and filled symbols ) , for two different values of the debye length .",
    "the symbols show exact enumeration results , obtained using periodic boundary conditions and are thus representative of an infinitely long system , while the lines show mean - field results . for both values of the debye length",
    "there are significant deviations between the nn result and the full interaction .",

    "the charged units are located in side groups , rather than being close to the polymer axis .",
    "this raises the question whether an interaction much larger than the usual debye - hckel interaction will occur even if the charges are displaced from the axis . within the simple cylindrical model presented above",
    ", this question can be addressed by calculating the electrostatic interaction between two monomers as a function of @xmath104 .",
    "such a calculation is shown if fig .  5 , for four different values of the screening length @xmath61 .",
    "the monomers are separated by a distance of @xmath96 , while the polymer radius is taken as @xmath94 , as in fig  4 . in all four cases",
    "a very large decrease of @xmath15 occurs with increase of @xmath104 toward the cylinder boundary , @xmath105 . for large @xmath106",
    "this result is not surprising , since the cylinder becomes similar to a planar interface , separating an aqueous ionic solution and a low dielectric medium .",
    "near such an interface the electrostatic interaction is equal to twice the screened electrostatic interaction in water @xcite . for large cylinder radius @xmath107",
    "we have checked that eq .",
    "( [ psicyl ] ) indeed yields this result . in fig .",
    "5 the cylinder radius is not large compared to the debye length and the interaction close to the cylinder boundary is even smaller than in the planar limit . the screened interaction in water is shown for comparison using dashed lines .",
    "the above analysis demonstrates that actual electrostatic interactions between near - by monomers depend strongly on the spatial organization of the pe .",
    "these interactions probably can not be estimated reliably using simplified models such as the cylindrical one presented above . the detailed polymer structure , as well as other effects such as the discreteness of the solvent , must be taken into account .",
    "although the comparison with exact enumeration demonstrates that a two - sublattice model is useful , one may ask to what extent the separation into two sublattices has a physical significance . in order to discuss this question we note that within the plateau region of the titration curve there is typically a strong anti - correlation between even and odd monomers . in order to understand this anti - correlation one may think of the ground state of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ znew ] ) , concentrating first on the special case @xmath39 .",

    "the long range order of the ground state is not preserved within the exact theory at any finite temperature , due to the entropy associated with domain boundaries in a one dimensional system @xcite .",

    "results are shown for three different ph values : in the top plot ph = 7 , corresponding to @xmath39 .",
    "the correlation function has a staggered form which persists over the full length of the pe .",
    "nevertheless it is clear that there is no true long range order because the ( anti ) correlation decreases slightly with monomer separation . in the middle plot , where the ph is equal to 9",
    ", the correlation has a shorter range , persisting only up to a distance of about 8 sites from the center monomer .",
    "note that a ph value of 9 is approximately at the right edge of the plateau region seen in fig .",
    "4(a ) . with further increase of ph",
    "the correlation length continues to decrease and at ph = 13.5 ( bottom plot ) there is almost no correlation even between adjacent monomers .",
    "this ph value is close to the transition point that is found in the two - sublattice model , beyond which there is no symmetry breaking between the two sublattices . in summary ,",
    "6 demonstrates that the two - sublattice approximation captures an essential physical property of the dissociation pattern that is absent in the uniform mean field approach , namely a strong anti - correlation between even and odd sites .    in principle ,",
    "a periodicity other than two may be included in the formulation of the mean field equations , and could lead , for certain parameters , to a lower free energy than the two - fold periodicity . in such cases",
    "a plateau would be expected in the titration curve at an average degree of dissociation other than one half .",
    "comparison with the exact enumeration and with typical experimental results indicates that such additional symmetry breaking into structures with more than two sublattices does not occur within the physical parameters considered in this work .",
    "in the second part of this work , where we will look at the interaction between two weak polyelectrolytes , we will employ simple debye - hckel interactions , as well as the interaction within a cylindrical dielectric cavity with @xmath112 , which constitute the two extreme cases . in both cases",

    "we can expect a stronger interaction between the polymers for small @xmath113 .",
    "this will lead to an increase of the average charging at somewhat larger values of @xmath113 than in fig .",
    "the main result in the first part of this work concerns a generalization of the standard mean - field theory of charge regulation in weak pes .",
    "the polymer is divided into two sublattices , allowing explicitly for correlations between these sublattices to be taken into account .",
    "similar models have been studied in the past in the context of ising - like models . in the ising model ,",
    "interactions are usually assumed to be short - ranged .",
    "if only interactions between neighboring monomers are considered , the partition function can be calculated exactly . for pes",
    "the main advantage of using a mean - field approximation is that it allows long - range electrostatic interactions to be taken into account .",
    "simultaneously , one expects mean - field methods to gain in accuracy as the range of interactions increases .",
    "our main result is that a mean - field approach with separation into two sublattices is adequate within a wide range of model parameters . in particular",
    "it succeeds in the case of large inter - monomer interactions , where a uniform mean - field theory fails , while also taking into account long range interactions , which may still play an important role .",
    "a motivation for the use of a nearest - neighbor approximation was recently suggested in ref .",
    "it was pointed out that a low dielectric constant of the polymer backbone can lead to strong enhancement of the coupling between close - by monomers .",
    "we show that even within the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the nearest neighbor approximation needs improvement for large values of the debye length , because of the contribution of interactions between non - neighboring monomers . on the other hand ,",
    "a mean - field approximation with two sublattices is semi - quantitatively accurate .",
    "we also demonstrate that effects due to the dielectric discontinuity between the pe interior and the aqueous solvent depend sensitively on the location of the charged groups within the low - dielectric cavity ; this is quite relevant , since for most experimental pe architectures , the charged groups are not located centrally but are displaced towards the aqueous interface .",
    "the linearized debye - hckel theory is used in this work to evaluate the interaction between monomers .",
    "this , of course , is only an approximation , whereas in principle the full non - linear response of the ionic solution must be taken into account .",
    "use of debye - hckel interactions is justified as long as the electrostatic potential is small compared to the thermal energy .",
    "hence this approximation is probably reasonably accurate in the plateau region , where the average charge along the polymer is small . far away from the plateau , and for highly charged pes",
    ", one needs to go beyond debye - hckel theory , using the non - linear poisson - boltzmann theory .",
    "the great advantage of using pairwise interactions is that they allow tractable , analytic solutions to be obtained .",
    "in contrast , the nonlinear distribution of ions can not be calculated analytically even near a uniformly charged cylinder immersed in a salt solution , let alone an inhomogeneously charged pe . in light of this situation we believe that the results presented in this work provide a useful qualitative treatment of charge regulation even for the case of highly charged pes , although they may be quantitatively modified by charge renormalization due to nonlinear effects close to the pe @xcite .    in the second part of this work we studied the interaction between a polyacid and a polybase , using a mean - field approximation .",
    "this interaction leads to an increase of the average charging in both polymers as they approach each other .",
    "in addition , the interaction energy between a weak polyacid and a weak polybase is stronger than expected in the absence of distance - dependent charge regulation .",
    "this means that the effect of charge regulation may be important for the building of stable multilayers , since it allows to simultaneously decrease the repulsion between similarly charged weak pes ( since the charge regulation in this case decreases the charge strength ) but also leads to strongly bound polyacid - polybase pairs . for close - by polymers",
    "the electrostatic energy is dominated by interactions between neighboring monomers , and the free energy depends only weakly on the debye screening length @xmath61 . on the other hand at large separation between the polymers both the average degree of dissociation and the free energy typically vary strongly with @xmath61 .",
    "the characteristic distance where interactions between the polymers can affect their degree of dissociation is the debye screening length .",
    "however , when there is a plateau in the charge _ vs. _ ph curve of a single pe , the degree of dissociation may remain close to @xmath168 even at small separations compared to @xmath61 . in these cases a sharp increase in the average dissociation can occur close to contact .",
    "the increase of charging when weak polyacids and weak polybases come into contact could in principle be observed using infra - red spectroscopy in multilayers .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that in such highly concentrated systems the oppositely charged groups will get very close to each other and form salt bridges .",
