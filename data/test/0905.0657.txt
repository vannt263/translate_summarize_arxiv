    "given some radiation field , a prediction can be made about the outcome of an experiment where a suitable detector is placed at some position @xmath0 and probes the radiation field for some time @xmath1 .",
    "even when the radiation field is known as precisely as possible , there is still a finite uncertainty in the outcome .",
    "this statement can also be formulated in the inverse way : it is not possible to build an apparatus that provides a `` better '' ( = more defined ) illumination at the point @xmath0 than this limit .",
    "we will demonstrate in this paper that the uncertainty of the photocount , quantified by its variance , depends on both the number of modes , including the energy distribution among the modes , and on the spectral properties and quantum correlations of the radiation field .",
    "another contribution to the uncertainty will appear if the radiation field is known at the source but the mode structure is then perturbed in some uncontrolled way before it reaches the location of the detector .",
    "the latter effect is frequently referred to as static speckle  @xcite named after the pattern it creates on a camera .",
    "the opposing term `` dynamic speckle '' unfortunately is used to denote two completely different concepts in the literature .",
    "frequently it refers to a static speckle pattern that is changing over time because the source of the perturbation is moving  @xcite but in this paper we refer to `` dynamic laser speckle ''  @xcite  an effect that is due to the quantum dynamics of the radiation field .",
    "quantum effects are most prominent on small length scales .",
    "modern optical lithography operates precisely in this regime , printing structures smaller than the wavelength of the light with a precision of a few nanometres  @xcite . to this end",
    ", photo resists have been developed that are more sensitive to changes of the light intensity than most technical sensors , thereby acting as efficient ( albeit unintentional ) detectors for uncertainties of the photocount . later in this paper",
    "we will show that the effects of multi - mode multi - frequency radiation are most pronounced neither at the limit of large or short times but in the intermediate regime .",
    "recent studies have confirmed that this is precisely the regime used in modern optical lithography  @xcite .",
    "classically a radiation field is described by its electric field @xmath2 as function of position @xmath3 and time @xmath4 . in a quantum treatment , the electric field @xmath5",
    "is replaced by a suitable operator . in both treatments ,",
    "the electric field is not a perfectly determined quantity , and the maximum knowledge possible is contained in the mutual - coherence function  @xcite @xmath6 we restrict ourselves to stationary fields such that @xmath7 does not depend on @xmath8 and @xmath9 but only on the time - difference @xmath10 .",

    "we assume that the frequency spectrum is small enough such that @xmath15 is independent of @xmath16 .",
    "whenever the frequency spectrum is equal to the natural linewidth of the light source , i.e. , the spectrum is due to the finite lifetime of some excited light - emitting medium such as in a laser , this assumption is always fulfilled . for other light sources ,",
    "this assumption can sometimes be problematic for cavity - like systems but for open system or in a waveguide geometry , this is less of an issue .",
    "if the condition that @xmath15 is independent of @xmath16 , should be violated , one can split the mode into several discrete modes ( one for each frequency interval in which the shape of the mode can assumed to be constant ) and the remainder of this paper be applied nonetheless . the electric field",

    ".  [ secstaticspeckle ] , random - matrix theory allows a compact and exact treatment of this problem .",
    "the resulting `` static speckle '' becomes the smaller the more modes of the radiation field are excited , and the more uniform the energy distribution among the modes is .",
    "depending on the `` size '' of the radiation field , there is thus a minimum amount of static speckle , which is computed in sec .",

    "[ secstatickorrelation ] we extend this question to computing the most likely amount of static speckle .",

    "while in `` general '' electrodynamics the electric field @xmath2 can be probed directly , this is not possible in the realm of optics as @xmath2 changes too quickly in time and space to allow a direct measurement .",
    "rather , the radiation field is probed by means of photodetection , i.e. , by absorbing photons inside some device and counting the number of photons absorbed .",
    "this principle applies to technical machines as well as to the human eye or to photo resists .    on small length and time scales , quantum effects become important . for this reason , and",

    "the optical phase space is spanned by position and spatial frequency , informally called @xmath88-vector , and the radiation field is completely described by the ( pseudo)-density function @xmath89 known as the wigner function . any radiation field then occupies a certain volume in phase space . unfortunately , there is no good mathematical metric to actually measure or at least define such a volume .    in experimental and technological areas of optics , in contrast , the volume of phase space occupied is well - defined and is referred to as etendue .",
    "the energy density @xmath90 of the light , given as a function of position and angle , is assumed to be larger than zero only inside a finite and well - defined region .",
    "this allows for an easy and direct definition of the etendue of the radiation field .",
    "etendue is an important quantity since , at least within geometrical optics , it can only be changed by vignetting the radiation field .",
    "the etendue supplied by some radiation field incident on some optical apparatus should thus be no larger than the etendue that this apparatus can accept .    convolving the wigner function @xmath89 with a small kernel , its size given by an uncertainty - relation  @xcite , yields @xmath90 when the relation @xmath91 between angle and @xmath88-vector is utilised .",
    "thus on first sight it might seem that the relation between microscopic and macroscopic definition would be straight - forward .",
    "the essential difference is that @xmath89 has no finite support whereas @xmath90 is assumed to have .",
    "it can be shown that due to the uncertainty principle , every mode @xmath18 needs to have infinite tails in at least either real space ( position ) or @xmath88-space ( angle )  @xcite , and this is reflected in @xmath89 .",
    "of course , also @xmath90 has the same infinite tails but in the macroscopic world , the function values inside those tails drop down so quickly that they are `` assumed '' to be zero once they are so low that they have become irrelevant for practical purposes .",
    "we thus need a definition for phase space volume that is based on a microscopic radiation field but reduces to the macroscopic etendue for `` large '' radiation fields . for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "the relevant way of quantifying phase space volume is by the number of modes that can be fit into it .",
    "we will tackle the problem in the opposite way : we pick a certain number of `` sensible '' base functions and compute all possible radiation fields that can be formed from them .",
    "we will then identify for the intensity profiles @xmath92 as function of position and @xmath93 as a function of direction the properties that allow to deduce the number of base functions used .    to have shorter mathematical expressions , we will express directions in terms of the @xmath88-vector instead of the angle @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore we make two assumptions .",
    "first , we restrict ourselves to one spatial dimension but the extension is straight - forward and becomes trivial when the radiation field factorises in its spatial dimensions .",
    "second , we assume that the intensity distribution @xmath95 factorises into a spatial term @xmath96 and an angular term @xmath97 . since the etendue accepted by practically any real - life apparatus factorises , these assumptions do not limit the applicability of this approach .",
    "we start with @xmath98 orthonormal base functions @xmath99 ,",
    "the orthogonality is essential since this prevents the base functions from being too similar and thus collapsing into a very small volume of phase space .",
    "furthermore , all modes of the radiation field have to be mutually orthogonal anyhow as they are eigenfunctions of a hermitian operator , cf .  eq .  ( [ eqgamma2 ] )",

    "the cross - correlator thus correctly quantifies if @xmath18 and @xmath155 are stronger correlated than in a random configuration , and the overlap integral @xmath271 is directly related to the static speckle pattern .    when a photodetector sums over @xmath84 pulses , the variance @xmath272 of the integrated photocount follows from the variances @xmath273 of the @xmath88-th pulse , given by eq .",

    "drawback of this approach is that this set then usually has to be overcomplete , hence it has more elements than there had been modes , and not all its elements are mutually orthogonal .",
    "for example , two gaussian beams have an overlap that decreases exponentially with separation but is always larger than zero .",
    "two plane waves restricted to a finite interval have an overlap that decreases exponentially with the angle between the two waves but is always finite .",
    "depending on the way that this expansion is done , some coherence information might be lost , namely when doing the expansion such that only the time - averaged intensities at all field - points are matched , and each @xmath18 is then assigned an intensity @xmath28 .",
    "this might sound like a bad approximation but effectively amounts to using the assumptions from sec .",
    "[ secstatickorrelation ] . inserting the @xmath28 into eq .",
    "( [ eqtemp2exakt ] ) would yield a low static speckle contrast since the number of @xmath28 s is large .",

    "( [ eqvarmehrere ] ) where every term is evaluated for a single function @xmath18 , and the nonorthogonality of the @xmath18 implies that the cross - correlation terms are large .",
    "this is as expected since introducing additional functions @xmath18 to describe the same system should not change its computed properties .",
    "the purpose of this paper has been to give a consistent and concise description of multi - frequency and multi - mode effects on photodetection on a quantum level trying to avoid the use of uncontrolled approximations .",
    "its focus lies on exactness , not on ease of presentation or application to some particular device .",
    "it thus complements previous work , for example by joseph w. goodman or the group around christer rydberg  @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ seczeitunschaerfe ] we derived how the uncertainty of the photocount depends on the measurement time and the temporal coherence function . among others , it was shown that a description via the coherence time of the radiation is insufficient to arrive at an exact result .",
    "similarly , in sec .  [ secstaticspeckle ] not only previously - known approximations of the static speckle contrast were retrieved , namely an inverse square - root law with the effective number of modes , but in addition also effects of finite etendue accepted by the `` mixing device '' or of noncoherent , e.g. thermal , radiation followed from the chosen mathematical formalism without additional effort .    some of the results of this paper can be explained , albeit only on a qualitative level , by the `` brick wall '' model : the radiation field is like a brick wall ( horizontally : time , vertically : position ) , and only bricks in the same column or row can cause interference effects . counting the fraction of such bricks",
    "gives an intuitive explanation of the scaling of dynamic and static speckle contrast upon changing system parameters .",
    "if this is sufficient , the methods and results presented in this paper are a bit of an overkill .",
    "if , on the other hand , exact agreement between predication and performance of some device is essential , this paper offers the advantage of giving results using only well - defined input parameters , thus not relying on effective parameters that need to be tuned until the desired result is retrieved .",
    "main function of any theory is to predict whether some device or experimental setup will work as expected and/or required . for state - of - the - art technological applications , the performance might improve by about @xmath277 from one generation of a device or setup to the next  but rarely more .",
    "to predict if something actually is an improvement , the error due to approximations thus has to be much smaller this number . as an example , fig .",
    "[ figkurvenformen ] gives an indication of the error made when using the coherence time instead of the exact shape of the frequency spectrum .",
    "if improvement of dynamic speckle is a topic , one should thus use the exact formulae and refrain from approximations .    depending on the desired application , either the present paper or one of the previous works by other authors",
    "will thus be more appropriate .",
    "furthermore , we restrict us to universal problems .",
    "for example , we study in sec .",
    "[ secstaticspeckle ] only the variance of the photocount , hence the contrast of the dark and bright `` spots '' in the plane of the detector , but not their spatial correlations , i.e. , the size of these spots .",
    "reason is that , while the contrast is universal , the size of the spots is not and depends on the setup .",
    "the book of goodman  @xcite is to a large extend devoted to studying this question ( on the classical level ) for a large number of setups of technological or scientific importance .    in sec .",
    "[ seczeitunschaerfe ] the uncertainty of the photocount for known radiation field has been computed , yielding in addition to the well - known shot noise term two terms depending on the frequency spectrum and on the photon correlations of the radiation source , respectively .",
    "the importance of the frequency spectrum is obvious , in particular in view of the two examples presented in this paper . for the importance of the effects of noncoherent",
    "radiation , the situation is less clear . for traditional thermal light sources",
    ", the necessary information can be found in this paper ; for traditional lasers , the emitted radiation is coherent , and the question becomes trivial . for modern light sources , such as excimer lasers  @xcite that are increasingly used for high - power applications ,",
    "insufficient data is available .",
    "technological advances are fast , and no good characterisation of the photon correlations for modern devices seems to have been published . since this contribution to the noise inevitably becomes the dominant term once the measurement time is sufficiently long , this lack of knowledge is an actual issue .",
    "the static speckle , computed in sec .",
    "[ secstaticspeckle ] , depends on the number of excited modes of the radiation field ( and the energy distribution among them ) but , in addition , also on the number of modes that could in principle be excited .",
    "this is closely related to the concept of etendue , cf .",
    "[ secetendue ] .",
    "even though etendue is a very basic quantity , its microscopic definition does not seem to have been addressed before .",
    "the relation presented between number of basis function and macroscopic etendue has application beyond this paper as any modelling of a radiation field  for the purpose of simulation or for an analytic study  needs to start with a given number of modes , and knowing this number a priori makes this process much more efficient .    while the applicability of the relation between etendue and maximum number of modes is obvious , this is less the case for sec .",
    "[ secstatickorrelation ] discussing the relation between etendue and average effective number of modes .",
    "we demonstrated that this average is identical to the actual number for almost all radiation fields .",
    "however , that is `` only '' a statistical statement : it assumes that all possible radiation fields with given etendue are equally likely , and it is still allowed that a few cases ( albeit of measure zero ) deviate strongly .",
    "different light sources have different properties , and for any technological application , one will choose the most appropriate light source . selecting a single - mode laser that operates in a high - order hermite - gauss mode",
    "would give the most extreme disagreement between the actual number of modes ( = one ) and the prediction from sec .",
    "[ secstatickorrelation ] .",
    "the results from this section can thus only be applied when the choice for a particular light source does not adversely impair the freedom of the mode structure of the generated light field ."
