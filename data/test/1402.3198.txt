    "enriching microdata with spatial information opens up numerous additional approaches for analysis . in the area of epidemiology",
    ", this insight goes back at least to the middle of the 19th century when john snow identified a contaminated water pump in london as the source of a cholera outbreak by linking the cases of mortality to their location and visualising these locations and the positions of surrounding water pumps on a map  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", spatial analysis techniques have become increasingly attractive in the social sciences as well  @xcite .",
    "however , when personal microdata containing sensitive information ( e.g. , gathered in a survey or health study ) are published for research purposes , the anonymity of the individuals has to be guaranteed .",
    "it has been pointed out in  @xcite that _ location is often one of the critical pieces of information for a successful re - identification attack_. therefore , usually only microdata that contain spatial information in an aggregated form are released , which restricts the choice of applicable techniques for analysis drastically .",
    "in particular , distance calculations that are based on aggregated data become difficult and imprecise  @xcite , especially for entities that are closely related .",
    "since many data mining techniques and methods in spatial analysis require accurate distance computations , it is necessary to investigate the extent to which additionally published ( approximate ) inter - record distances influence the risk of identity disclosure and how a possible non - acceptable increase of this risk can be prevented .",
    "our work presented in this article provides a novel approach for tackling these questions .",
    "we introduce a flexible natural graph model for microdata with known inter - record distances .",
    "the search for a maximum common subgraph between two such graph models is interpreted as a novel kind of linkage attack on such microdata .",
    "we discuss the relative merits of our method in comparison to the usual linkage attacks on the basis of a small - scale example ( example  [ example : poets ] in section  [ sec : linkage_attack ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in the special case of geographical distances , it is shown that , on the basis of simulated data , a non - negligible risk of identity disclosure exists if @xmath0-distributed gaussian noise is added to the input coordinates for too small values of @xmath1 . for larger values of @xmath1 ( which lead to sufficiently anonymised data ) , however , the data become nearly useless for further analysis .",
    "these results reflect a trade - off between data utility and disclosure risk through the proposed attack .      in section [ sec : background ] , we refer to related work .",
    "the preparatory work is given in section [ sec : graph_model ] as well as a graph model for microdata in a metric space which forms the basis of the graph theoretic linkage attack introduced in section [ sec : linkage_attack ] . in section [ sec : experimental_results ] , this attack is evaluated by means of a simulation study .",
    "we conclude and discuss the possible directions for future research in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "as already indicated in the introductory section above , the original motivation for the work presented in this article stems back to the wish to also make the wide variety of distance - based methods ( e.g. from spatial statistics ) applicable for microdata that are published for scientific purposes .",
    "since it is intuitively compelling that naive release of the exact distances between individuals can increase the risk of deanonymisation , the interest question , however , is how might the knowledge of approximate distances change the risk of identity disclosure , i.e. the chance of a data snooper attempting to identify some of the entities .",
    "in general , the analysis of such deanonymisation attacks on microdata and the development of tools for their anonymisation is a central topic of _ statistical disclosure control _",
    "it is universally acknowledged that a necessary but insufficient first step during the process of anonymisation consists in the removal of all attributes that can be used to identify an individual entity unambiguously ( this step is usually referred to as _ deidentification _ ) .",
    "such attributes ( e.g. , ` social insurance number ` ) are called _",
    "( direct ) identifiers _ , in contrast to _ quasi - identifiers _ , which do not have the power to nullify an individual s anonymity on their own , a distinction which has to be ascribed to dalenius  @xcite .    by using a combination of quasi - identifiers , however , it might be possible to assign an entity from the underlying population to a specific record of a published microdata file unambigously .",
    "for example , in  @xcite it was shown that based on 1990 us census data , 87% of the population of the united states are uniquely determined by their values with respect to the quasi - identifier set \\{`5-digit zip code ` , ` gender ` , ` date of birth`}. this fact motivates a mode of attack that is commonly referred to as _ linkage attack _",
    "@xcite : in this scenario , it is assumed that a data snooper has access to an external auxiliary microdata file ( called _ identification file _ ) containing both direct identifiers and quasi - identifiers as attributes . by making use of the quasi - identifiers , the snooper attempts to identify entities by linking records from the identification file to records from the published microdata file ( termed _ target file _ ) .",
    "a real - life example of linkage via quasi - identifiers is due to sweeney  @xcite : she was able to detect the record corresponding to the governor of massachusetts in a published health data file by linkage with a publicly obtainable voter registration list .",
    "even though theoretical results on linkage attacks were recently obtained in  @xcite , the concept of @xmath2-anonymity had already been proposed as a remedy against linkage attacks in  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of @xmath2-anonymity is to modify the records in the released microdata such that every record coincides with at least @xmath3 other records with respect to the quasi - identifiers .",
    "for this reason , an unambiguous linkage between the identification and target file will not be possible . the graph theoretic linkage attack introduced in section [ sec : linkage_attack ]",
    "contains the classical linkage attack via quasi - identifiers as a subroutine , however , it provides a way to resolve at least some of the ambiguous matches .",
    "several papers on _ privacy preserving data mining _ have already discussed privacy issues with respect to the distance - preserving transformations of microdata . however , in these articles it is generally assumed that the considered distances can be directly calculated from the microdata , whereas our focus is on microdata enriched with supplementary distances between the entities that can not be calculated from the microdata itself .",
    "moreover , in most cases only specific kinds of distances have been considered ( e.g. , @xmath4-distance in  @xcite or the euclidean ( i.e. @xmath5- ) distance in  @xcite ) .    in contrast , the attack proposed in this paper can be applied to any kind of distance function ( notwithstanding that the special case of spatial distances motivated our research and is exclusively referred to in our examples ) .",
    "furthermore , a distance - preserving technique for the anonymisation of binary vectors is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to our approach , in that article the distance information alone is not assumed to increase the risk of identity disclosure .",
    "there is a vast literature on the problem of identity disclosure when dealing with spatially referenced data .",
    "the opportunities and challenges with regard to spatial data in the context of social sciences are discussed in great detail in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "articles  @xcite and  @xcite give illustrative examples of how naive publishing of spatially referenced data can lead to a violation of anonymity : in both cases , the respective authors were able to reconstruct many of the original addresses successfully from published low resolution maps . a currently flourishing branch of research deals with anonymisation techniques for datasets containing mobility traces of individuals  @xcite ( e.g. , obtained via mobile phone tracking ) .",
    "this topic is usually referred to as _ location privacy _  @xcite .    in this article , however , we consider the deanonymisation risk that arises from the knowledge of the ( approximate ) distances between fixed spatial points assigned to the entities in a microdata table .",
    "various methods for the anonymisation of geographic point data ( not necessarily taking additional covariates into consideration as in our case ) have been discussed under the term of _ geographical masks_. @xcite and  @xcite provide comprehensive outlines of the existing methods .",
    "a noteworthy method is due to wieland et al .",
    "@xcite , who developed a method based on linear programming that moves each point in the dataset as little as possible under a given quantitative risk of re - identification . however , the aim of nearly all proposed anonymisation techniques for spatially referenced data consists in distorting the spatial distribution with respect to the underlying geographical area as little as possible , whereas attempts predominantly focusing on the preservation of distances have not yet been discussed in the context of spatial data .",
    "it appears to be obvious that neglecting the underlying geographical area might yield more accurate results regarding distance calculations .",
    "the use of a graph model in this article might suggest a strong connection between our approach and the methods discussed in the area of _ social network anonymisation _  @xcite . however , we model the microdata with known inter - record distances using a complete graph with vertex labels and edge weights , which is a very specific model in contrast to the more general graph models commonly used in social network analysis .",
    "indeed , the graphs modelling social networks are usually a long way off from being complete and their edges are not usually weighted .",
    "for example , in  @xcite the underlying graph model considers discrete edge labels instead of real valued weights only .",
    "furthermore , active attacks ( consisting in the addition of nodes to the published network by an intruder ) as in  @xcite do not seem to be sensible when investigating the risk of identity disclosure for published microdata . however , the active attack proposed in  @xcite is related to the one in this paper because it also makes use of graph algorithmic building blocks .",
    "it consists in the detection of a subgraph in a larger graph , whereas the attack in this paper is based on finding the common subgraphs of two different graphs .      to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this paper is the first one to make use of a graph model for a microdata file and the distances between its records .",
    "finding a matching between two such graph models constitutes the basic principle of the graph theoretic linkage attack proposed in this article and is an often considered problem in the _ pattern recognition _ field and its various areas of application ( see  @xcite as a source providing an extensive outline ) .",
    "fundamental to our presentation is the article by levi  @xcite , which motivates to transform the problem of finding the ( maximum ) common subgraphs of two graphs into a ( maximum ) clique detection problem , and its adaption in  @xcite where the original approach by levi has been relaxed in order to deal with approximate common subgraphs as well .",
    "this transformation to the maximum clique detection problem is of particular interest due to its various fields of application ( e.g. biochemistry  @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of finding a maximum clique in a graph is known to be np - hard  @xcite and a great deal of attention has been paid to the development of techniques for solving this problem either exactly or at least approximately  @xcite . for the simulation study in section",
    "[ sec : experimental_results ] of this paper , we made use of the maximum clique detection algorithm introduced by konc and janei in  @xcite .",
    "exploring the limits of our approach in view of its scalability towards very large files is postponed to future research .",
    "a metric space is a pair @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a set and @xmath8 is a ( distance ) function @xmath9 satisfying the following three conditions : ( i ) @xmath10 and @xmath11 whenever @xmath12 , ( ii ) @xmath13 and ( iii ) @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the deduplicated microdata table @xmath15 at hand contains information with respect to an attribute set @xmath16 about @xmath17 entities from an underlying population .",
    "the fact that the distances between the entities of @xmath15 are known can be modelled in mathematical terms by means of a function @xmath18:=\\{1,\\ldots , n_t\\ } \\to ( x , d)$ ] , @xmath19 which maps the @xmath20th record / entity of @xmath15 to a point @xmath21 in a metric space @xmath7 such that the distance between records @xmath20 and @xmath22 of @xmath15 is equal to @xmath23 . the distances between all the entities can then be stored in the @xmath24 distance matrix @xmath25 .",
    "such a pair @xmath26 is hereafter referred to as _ microdata in a metric space_.    note that we did not state any assumptions on the function @xmath27 such as injectivity or surjectivity .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath28 $ ] itself becomes a metric space by the pullback of @xmath8 via @xmath27 if and only if @xmath27 is injective ( see page 81 in  @xcite ) .",
    "in general , @xmath28 $ ] becomes a pseudometric space only . from our point of view , this flexibility regarding @xmath27 is intended as the records of a microdata table often only form a pseudometric instead of a metric space , which is illustrated by the following example : consider microdata about individuals which have been gathered in a scientific survey . if two respondents share a common residence , the geographical distance between these respondents will be equal to zero and thus the set of respondents with the related distances between them forms a pseudometric space only .",
    "thus , the distance matrix @xmath29 is not assumed to be a proper distance matrix , i.e. zeroes outside the diagonal are permitted .",
    "given a set @xmath30 , we denote the set of its two - element subsets by @xmath31 ^ 2 $ ] .",

    "the existence of an edge between @xmath37 and @xmath38 will sometimes be denoted by @xmath40 as a shorthand .",
    "a graph is called _ complete _ if any two of its vertices are adjacent .",

    "if @xmath44 ^ 2 \\cap e$ ] holds , the graph @xmath45 is called an _ induced subgraph _ of @xmath36 or we say that the subset @xmath46 of vertices induces @xmath45 in @xmath36 which is denoted by @xmath47 $ ] . a subset of the vertex set @xmath33 is a _ clique _ if the subgraph induced by these vertices is complete . a clique containing @xmath2 elements",
    "is termed a @xmath2__-clique__. a clique is _ maximal _ if it is not contained in a larger clique .",
    "a clique is _ maximum _ if there is no other clique containing more vertices .",
    "clearly , a maximum clique is always maximal , but generally not vice versa .",
    "the notion of a vertex - labelled and edge - weighted graph is of fundamental importance to the graph model for microdata in a metric space introduced below .",
    "this notion is just a special case of the more general notion of an _ attributed graph _ which is frequently used in the pattern recognition community  @xcite .",

    "let @xmath26 be microdata in a metric space and @xmath53 the number of records in @xmath15 as above .",

    "obviously , it would be easy to widen this model , e.g. by introducing directed edges , if this were necessary for a specific application .",

    "@xmath1 would have to be chosen large enough to guarantee at least some degree of anonymity , that useful analyses based on the distances would become difficult . for this reason , the development of distance modification techniques that guarantee a certain degree of anonymity , and make it possible to also conduct useful analyses on the anonymised data , will be an important aspect of future research .    .",
    "the threshold parameter @xmath78 was chosen equal to @xmath84.,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    note that in our specific example , the snooper would primarily attempt to achieve a high precision : in the case of geographic distances , a point is uniquely determined by the exact distances to three other points . if the snooper could deanonymise at least three entities successfully , exploiting this fact would be a good starting point to identify even more individuals . for arbitrary metric spaces ,",
    "such a relationship does not hold in general , albeit the successful deanonymisation of some entities would also alleviate a snooper s work in this more general case .",
    "obviously , for distance modification techniques other than perturbation of the input coordinates , a snooper will have to modify the graph theoretical linkage attack , especially the definition of @xmath82 .",
    "however , due to kerckhoffs principle , it has to be assumed that the snooper at least knows the distance modification technique used by the holder of the target file and exploits this knowledge in the precise construction of the attack .",
    "for instance , if noise is not added to the input coordinates before computing the distance matrix but rather to the distance matrix itself ( a technique discussed in  @xcite ) , the attack has to be slightly adapted . in this case , when defining the relation @xmath82 the quantiles of the noise distribution can be used directly , thereby making the empirical study on distance deviations originating from perturbation of the input coordinates unnecessary .",
    "moreover , in this specific case it might be reasonable to further modify the attack by relaxing the ( relatively strong ) notion of a maximum clique to the less restrictive notion of a maximum quasi - clique , a relaxation which has been successfully applied in  @xcite for the purpose of protein classification . in a similar way",
    ", our attack can be adapted to many other anonymisation techniques and thus provides a useful and flexible tool for the analysis of methods for distance - preserving anonymisation .",
    "in this article , we have introduced a novel graph theoretic linkage attack on microdata with additionally published ( approximate ) inter - record distances . in the special case of spatial distances , we have demonstrated  on the basis of our test data  that the release of distances increases the risk of identity disclosure unreasonably even if geographical coordinates have been perturbed by random gaussian noise before the distances are calculated .",
    "furthermore , we showed that augmenting the standard deviation of the added random noise will gradually lead to a sufficient level of anonymity , but also make the perturbed distances useless for further analysis .",
    "therefore , the development and analysis of anonymisation techniques for microdata in a metric space that guarantee a certain degree of anonymity but distort the distances as little as possible ( particularly with regard to the applicability of data mining techniques ) will be an important aspect of future research .",
    "this research has been supported by a grant from the german research foundation ( dfg ) to rainer schnell .",
