    "the emerging field of optomechanics concerns with the study of the mechanical effects of light on mesoscopic and macroscopic mechanical oscillators .",
    "this phenomenon has been realized in the optomechanical systems consisting of an optical cavity with a movable end - mirror or with a membrane - in - the middle .",
    "the radiation pressure exerted by the light inside the optical cavity couples the moving mirror or the membrane which acts as a mechanical oscillator to the optical field .",
    "this optomechanical coupling has been employed for a wide range of applications such as the cavity cooling of microlevers and nanomechanical resonators to their quantum mechanical ground state @xcite , producing high precision detectors for measuring weak forces and small displacements and also providing a good approach for fundamental studies of the transition between the quantum and the classical world @xcite .",
    "on the other hand an alternative path to the studies of cavity optomechanics has been provided experimentally by systems consisting of ultracold atomic ensembles trapped in optical cavities @xcite where the excitation of a collective mode of the cold gas plays the role of the vibrational mode of the mirror .",
    "the standing electromagnetic wave inside the cavity forms a periodic potential , the so - called optical lattice , in which the cold atoms exhibit phenomena typical of solid state physics like the formation of energy bands and bloch oscillations @xcite .    in such systems with high finesse cavities",
    "the atom - light interaction is enhanced because the atoms are collectively coupled to the same optical mode .",
    "besides , in the dispersive regime where the laser pump is far detuned from the atomic resonance the excited electronic state of the atoms can be adiabatically eliminated and consequently the only degrees of freedom of atoms will be their mechanical motions @xcite . for low photon numbers when the optical grating produced by the intracavity optical field is very shallow , one can approximately restrict the dynamics to the first two motional modes @xcite . in more recent theoretical investigations @xcite",
    "it has been shown that the simple two - mode model of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) can be improved by considering higher motional modes .    in spite of similarities between the two kinds of optomechanical systems ( with a moving mirror and with a bec ) ,",
    "there are some essential differences between them .",
    "firstly , in contrast to the moving mirror of the optomechanical sytems which is placed in the harmonic potential of its spring , the excitation modes of the bec are not based on the presence of such an external harmonic potential @xcite .",
    "secondly , their parameters are realized in different regimes ; the frequency of the excitation mode of the bec , i.e. , recoil frequency , is well below the dipole coupling strength while the oscillation frequency of a moving mirror is of the same order of magnitude as the coupling strength @xcite . on the other hand in addition to pumping the cavity from one of the end mirrors , in the cavities equipped with atomic gas it is also possible to pump the atoms from the side of the cavity@xcite .",
    "one of the most important characteristics of the many - body systems is the two - body collision which can affect the properties of the system . so in order to study the dynamics of a bec gas in a realistic experimental situation",
    ", it is necessary to take it into account . in the optomechanical systems containing the atomic gas",
    "there are two kinds of atom - atom interactions which are the origins of the system nonlinearities .",
    "firstly , due to the atom - photon interaction the potential acting on the condensate depends in a highly nonlocal and nonlinear way on the condensate itself which leads to the long range atomic interaction mediated by the cavity field @xcite . on the other hand",
    "there is an intrinsic nonlinearity due to the s - wave scattering which can take place at arbitrary momentum values and causes a broadening of the atomic momentum distribution @xcite due to the intraband transitions and also can scatter atoms to the other bands ( interband transitions)@xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is another kind of nonlinearitiy due to the finiteness of the particle number of the system which can be neglected in the thermodynamic limit where the total number of atoms is very large @xcite .    in this work , we are going to extend the two - mode model considering the effects of atom - atom interaction for a one - dimensional bec in an optical cavity .",
    "we consider the system in the low photon regime but will not restrict our treatment to the weak atom - atom interaction .",
    "in fact the atomic collisions can populate several nonzero quasimomenta of the energy bands ( intraband transition ) and can also cause the atoms to be scattered to the other bands ( interband transitions ) . in order to have a simplified optomechanical model we take into account just the lowest nozero quasimomenta in the first brillouin zone .",
    "we show that in the bogoliubov approximation the atom - atom interaction not only shifts the energies of the excited modes but also play the role of an oprtical parametric amplifier ( opa ) for the bogoliubov side mode which can affect its normal - mode splitting behaviour @xcite . on the other hand due to the atomic collisions the resonance frequency of the cavity",
    "is shifted which leads to the decrease of the number of cavity photons and the depletion of the bogoliubov mode .",
    "these results are in good agreement with those obtained by the numerical solutions of the full description of gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec . ii we will first give a thorough theoretical description of the many - body system under consideration and then derive a simplified optomechanical model . in sec .",
    "iii the quantum langevin equations ( qles ) are derived and linearized around the semiclassical steady state . in sec .",
    "iv we study the mean - field solutions and fluctuations of the system and in sec .",
    "v we derive the spectrum of the bogoliubov mode and investigate the normal mode splitting ( nms ) .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarised in sec .",
    "and the decay rate is @xmath0.,width=3 ]    we are going to study a gas of @xmath1 ultracold bosonic two - level atoms with mass @xmath2 and transition frequency @xmath3 inside the optical lattice of a single - mode , high - finesse fabry - perot cavity with length @xmath4 .",
    "the cavity is driven at rate @xmath5 through one of its mirrors by a laser with frequency @xmath6 , and wavenumber @xmath7 .",
    "we assume the bec is confined in a cylindrically symmetric trap with a transverse trapping frequency @xmath8 and negligible longitudinal confinement along the @xmath9 direction ( fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) . in this way we can describe the dynamics within an effective one - dimensional model by quantizing the atomic motional degree of freedom along the @xmath9 axis only .      in the dispersive regime where the laser pump is far detuned from the atomic resonance ( @xmath10 exceeds the atomic linewidth @xmath11 by orders of magnitude ) ,",
    "the excited electronic state of the atoms can be adiabatically eliminated and spontaneous emission can be neglected @xcite . in the frame rotating at the pump frequency , the many - body hamiltonian reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the annihilation operator for a cavity photon and @xmath14 is the cavity - pump detuning .",
    "@xmath15 is the single - particle hamiltonian of an atom inside the optical lattice of the cavity and @xmath16 is the atom - atom interaction that are respectively given by    [ hamil1 ] @xmath17    here @xmath18 is the optical lattice barrier height per photon and represents the atomic backaction on the field , @xmath19 is the vacuum rabi frequency , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the two - body s - wave scattering length @xcite . the second term in the hamiltonian of eq.([hamil1]a ) is a periodic potential of period @xmath22 .",
    "it is well - known that the eigenfunctions of a particle inside a periodic potential are the bloch functions @xmath23 with eigenvalues @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the bloch band index and @xmath26 $ ] is the quasimomentum of the particle @xcite . if there are @xmath27 periods inside the cavity , then @xmath28 .",
    "using the born - von karman periodic boundary condition @xmath29 and based on the bloch theorem , @xmath30 it is deduced that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 . in this way the quasimomentum @xmath33 in the first brillouin zone can be written in terms of optical wave number , i.e. , @xmath34 where @xmath35 . now using the bloch theorem ,",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath36 can be written as @xmath37 here @xmath38 is a periodic function with the optical lattice period @xmath39 and reads @xmath40 by substituting eq.([u ] ) into eq.([bloch2 ] ) , the eigenfunctions of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath15 is obtained as @xmath41    the second quantized atomic wave field @xmath42 can be expanded as a fourier series in terms of the bloch functions , i.e. , @xmath43 here @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for the atomic field that annihilates ( creates ) a particle in a state determined with the bloch band index @xmath25 and quasimomentum @xmath33 . by using this expansion",
    "the hamitlonian of the system is diagonalized and one can investigate the bloch band structure of the condensate @xcite .",
    "however , the fourier coefficients @xmath46 can only be determined numerically and there is no closed form for the bloch functions . instead , by substituting eq.([blochf ] ) into eq.([psi ] ) one can obtain a fourier expansion of the atomic field in therms of plane waves @xmath47 in the derivation of eq.([psi2 ] ) we have done a bogoliubov transformation @xmath48 where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is the atomic field operator that annihilates ( creates ) a particle in a state determined with the band index @xmath51 and quasimomentum @xmath33 .    by substituting eq.([psi2 ] ) into eq.([h1 ] ) the hamiltonian of the systems can be written as @xmath52 in these sums @xmath53 , @xmath35 , and @xmath54 are the energy eigenvalues in which @xmath55 is the recoil energy .",
    "as seen , the field expansion of eq.([psi2 ] ) can no longer diagonalize the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "in fact that part of hamiltonian which corresponds to the atom - photon interaction remains nondiagonal . due to the interaction with",
    "the optical filed , the atoms are scattered to the nearest bands ( @xmath56 ) while their quasimomentum ( @xmath57 ) remains unchanged .      since the optical potential is symmetric with respect to the origin , the hamiltonian of the system has the parity symmetry .",
    "so if the sytem starts from a homogeneous bec , only the cosine parts of the exponential functions in eq.([psi2 ] ) are excited because of the parity conservation . in the limit of weak photon - atom coupling ,",
    "when either the photon number inside the cavity or @xmath58 is small , the lowest bands @xmath59 can be excited by fluctuations resulting from the atom - light interaction @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the s - wave scattering populates fluctuations with arbitrary @xmath51 and @xmath57 @xcite . in a very simplified optomechanical model",
    "one can consider the scattering from @xmath60 to @xmath61 in the lowest band @xmath62 . in this way the atomic field operator ( eq.([psi2 ] ) ) can be truncated as @xmath63 where we have done the following bogoliubov transformations    @xmath64    in the case that the system does not have parity symmetry , for example when the bec is inside a ring cavity , one should also consider sine modes with annihilation operators @xmath65 which in our model have been set aside @xcite . by substituting the atomic field operator , eq.([opaf ] ) , into the hamiltonian of eq.([h1 ] ) , one can arrive at the following hamiltonian @xmath66 where    [ ac aa ] @xmath67    the first two terms in eq.([opa ] ) denote the cavity and the pump hamiltonians .",
    "the third term is the energy of the side - modes @xmath68 and @xmath69 which is just the third term in eq.([h2 ] ) with energy eigenvalues @xmath70 given by eq.([epsilon ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath71 denotes the atom - photon interaction and @xmath16 is the atom - atom interaction .",
    "furthermore , @xmath72 is the s - wave scattering frequency and @xmath73 is the waist of the optical potential .",
    "this hamiltonian can be further simplified since for weak optical fields and large @xmath74 the depletion of the initial condensate remains weak .",
    "so we can use the bogoliubov approximation and treat the zero - momentum mode classically , i.e. , @xmath75 @xcite . in this way",
    "eqs.([opa ] ) reduce to the following forms    [ hb ] @xmath76    here @xmath77 is the effective stark - shifted detuning . as seen from the hamiltonian of eq.([hb]b ) there are two kinds of optomechanical coupling .",
    "the first term of eq.([hb]b ) is the linear radiation pressure which couples the side mode @xmath68 to the optical field with the optomechanical coupling constant @xmath78 while the second term is the nonlinear optomechanical coupling of the two side modes @xmath68 and @xmath69 with the optical field . in the atom - atom interaction hamiltonian @xmath16",
    "we have disregarded all terms proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "the influence of s - wave scattering has partly appeared as a shift in the side modes energies ( the third and fourth tems in eq.([subhb ] ) ) . since @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the density of atoms , it is apparent that the energy shits obtained here is the same as that of bogoliubov theory @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the role of @xmath16 in eq.([hb ] ) for the bogoliubov side modes is very similar to that of an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) in an optomechanical system with the nonlinear gain parameter @xmath82 @xcite . in sec .",
    "v we will show how this parameter can affect the nms behaviour of the coupled bogoliubov mode and the cavity field .",
    "the dynamics of the optomechanical system described by eqs.([hb ] ) is fully characterized by the following set of nonlinear qles , written in the frame rotating at the input laser frequency ,    [ nql ] @xmath83-\\eta+\\xi,\\\\ \\dot{c}_{10}&=&-(i\\omega_{10}+\\gamma)c_{10}-i\\frac{\\sqrt{2n}}{4}u_{0}a^{\\dagger}a-\\frac{iu_{0}}{2}a^{\\dagger}a c_{10}\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{i}{2}\\omega_{sw}c^{\\dagger}_{10}+f_{10},\\\\ \\dot{c}_{01}&=&-(i\\omega_{01}+\\gamma)c_{01}-\\frac{iu_{0}}{2}a^{\\dagger}a c_{01}-\\frac{i}{2}\\omega_{sw}c^{\\dagger}_{01}+f_{01},\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath84 and @xmath85 . here",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath11 characterize the dissipation of the cavity field and collective density excitations of the bec , respectively .",
    "the cavity - field quantum vacuum fluctuation @xmath86 satisfies the markovian correlation functions , i.e. , @xmath87 , @xmath88 with the average thermal photon number @xmath89 which is nearly zero at optical frequencies @xcite . besides , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the thermal noise inputs for the two side modes of bec which also satisfy the same markovian correlation functions as those of the optical noise .",
    "the noise sources are assumed uncorrelated for the different modes of both the matter and light fields .",
    "now we are going to study the weak excitations of the condensate from its ground state .",
    "such excitations include small deviations of both the atomic wave function and the optical field from their respective stationary states .",
    "so we decompose each operator in eqs.([nql ] ) as the sum of its steady - state value and a small fluctuation . by substituting @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 into eqs.([nql ] ) one can obtain a set of nonlinear algebraic equations for the steady - state values ,    [ ss ] @xmath95    where we have assumed @xmath96 and @xmath97 are real numbers @xcite and @xmath98 is the effective detuning , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "eq.([ss]c ) shows that the mean value of the mode @xmath69 is zero .",
    "it is the consequence of the fact that the ground state of the translationally invariant system is also invariant under discrete translation @xcite . on the other hand , the linearized qles for the fluctuating operators take the followinf forms    [ flc ] @xmath101    where @xmath102 is the effective atom - photon coupling parameter . by defining the quadrature fluctuations    [ flc ] @xmath103    with @xmath104 ,",

    "it is due to the fact that in the qles , eqs.([nql]c ) , there is no standard radiation pressure coupling between the side mode @xmath69 and the optical field .",
    "instead , it is coupled to the radiation field via the nonlinear term , @xmath112 which is as small as @xmath113 of the radiation pressure term , and is deleted during the linearization process ( because the mean field value of this mode , @xmath114 , is zero ) . in this way the side mode @xmath69 acts as a medium level in the dynamics .      in order to study the stationary properties of the system",
    "it is enough to focus our attention on the subspace spanned by the optical mode and the side mode @xmath68 .",
    "it means that we can consider only the upper block of the drift matrix of eq.([a ] ) .",

    "however , due to the atomic collisions the bogoliubov side mode @xmath68 is depleted to other modes i.e. , the mean value @xmath97 decreases .",

    "as it was mentioned above , an increase in atom - atom interaction shifts the resonance of the cavity which reduces the number of photons of the cavity and also causes the depletion of the bogoliubov mode.this reduction in the mean values of photons and atoms leads to a reduction in the effective atom - photon coupling ( fig.[fig : fig3](b ) ) which causes the entanglement of atoms and photons to decrease .",

    "[ fig : fig6](a ) and [ fig : fig7](a ) we have plotted the normalized effective bogoliubov mechanical frequency @xmath195 versus the normalized frequency @xmath179 for two values of cavity damping rates @xmath183 ( fig.[fig : fig6 ] ( a ) ) and @xmath184 ( fig.[fig : fig7 ] ( a ) ) , and for two different values of @xmath180 ( thin line ) and @xmath181 ( thick line ) . as is seen from both figures , a higher two - body interaction makes the condensate more robust and the bogoliubov frequency of the condensate does not significantly deviate from @xmath191 .",
    "besides , a decrease in the damping rate of cavity causes the appearance of the peaks in the curves .    in figs.[fig : fig6](b ) and [ fig : fig7](b ) the normalized effective bogoliubov mechanical damping @xmath178 has been plotted versus the normalized frequency @xmath179 for two values of cavity damping rates @xmath183 ( fig.[fig : fig6 ] ( b ) ) and @xmath184 ( fig.[fig : fig7 ] ( b ) ) . in the case of fig.[fig : fig6](b ) where the damping rate of the cavity is nearly equal to the effective atom - photon coupling constant @xmath196 , the effective damping rate @xmath176 is much lower compared to the case of fig.[fig : fig7](b ) where @xmath197 .",
    "it means that the stronger atom - photon coupling , the higher atom loss and hence the higher value of the effective damping .",
    "an experimental observation of this phenomenon of light induced back - action heating and consequent loss of atoms has been reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was also found that the atom loss rate is increased near the resonance . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of atomic collisions on the effective damping rate has been demonstrated in figs.[fig : fig6](b ) and [ fig : fig7](b ) which show that a stronger atom - atom interaction causes the effective damping rate to be increased near the resonance points .",
    "therefore increasing the rate of atomic collisions can help us in cooling of the bogoliubov mode of the bec by the radiation pressure .",
    "finally , we are going to investigate the influence of atomic collisions on the phenomenon of nms in the power spectrum of bogoliubov displacement operator .",
    "the nms is associated with the mixing between the fluctuation of the cavity field around the steady state and the fluctuations of the condensate ( bogoliubov mode ) around the mean field .",
    "the origin of the fluctuations of the cavity field is the beat of the pump photons with the photons scattered from the condensate atoms .",
    "the phenomenon of nms is observable whenever the energy exchange between the two interacting modes takes place on a time scale faster than the decoherence of each mode .    in figs.[fig :",
    "fig6](c ) and [ fig : fig7](c ) we have shown the normalized power spectrum of the displacement operator of the bogoliubov mode @xmath198 versus the normalized frequency @xmath179 for two values of cavity damping rate @xmath183 ( fig.[fig : fig6 ] ( c ) ) and @xmath184 ( fig.[fig : fig7 ] ( c ) ) , and for two values of @xmath180 ( thin line ) and @xmath181 ( thick line ) . in the case of fig.[fig : fig6](c ) where the damping rate of the cavity is nearly equal to the effective coupling constant of atoms and photons @xmath196 , there is no splitting in the power spectrum ( neither for @xmath199 nor for @xmath200 ) while in fig.[fig : fig7](c ) where @xmath197 the nms is appeared for @xmath201 so in order to observe nms firstly the system should be in the strong coupling regime where the atom - photon coupling is larger than the decay rates of photons an atoms .",
    "when this condition is fulfilled , the nms can be observable with increasing atom - atom interaction .",
    "normal mode splitting of a system of large number of atoms coupled to a ring cavity has been observed experimentally in the strong cooperative coupling regime @xcite .",
    "the splitting of the normal mode has been observed by increasing the number of atoms which leads to the increase in the s - wave scattering frequency .",
    "in conclusion , we have done a theoretical investigation on the optomechanical properties of a one - dimensional bose - einstein condensate inside a driven optical cavity considering the effects of atomic collisions . due to the dispersive atom - photon interaction the atoms develop a band structure in the optical lattice of the cavity . in the limit of weak photon - atom coupling",
    "the lowest bands @xmath59 can be excited by fluctuations due to the atom - light interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the atomic collisions scatter the atoms to the higher band and also populate states with non zero quasimomentum .",
    "it has been shown that there is a nonlinear optomechanical coupling between the nonzero quasimomentum states with the optical field proportional to @xmath113 which can be disregarded in the bogoliubov approximation where the number of atoms in the bec mode is very large .",
    "therefore , there is no radiation pressure coupling between the atomic modes with nonzero quasimomentom and the cavity field in the bogoliubov approximation .    in this way we have obtained a simplified optomechanical model where the bogoliubov side mode @xmath68 is coupled to the optical field through the radiation pressure term and the atom - atom interaction hamiltonian behaves like an opa for the bogoliubov mode with the non - linear gain parameter @xmath82 .",
    "it has been shown that in the strong coupling regime where the effective atom - photon coupling is greater than the cavity damping rate , an increase in the s - wave scattering frequency would lead to the nms in the power spectrum of the bogoliubov mode .",
    "furthermore , the atom - atom interaction causes the depletion of the bogoliubov mode and also shifts the cavity resonance frequency which leads to a decrease in the mean number of cavity photons .",
    "besides , it decreases fluctuations in the number of photons and atoms .",
    "hence the decrease in the cavity output provides a direct measure of the atom - atom interaction within the condensate . on the other hand ,",
    "a stronger atomic collision rate causes a decrease in the effective atom - photon coupling which leads to a decrease in the entanglement between the bogoliubv mode and the optical field .",
