    "one of the succinct semi - classical approaches for investigating the quantum nature of gravity is via black hole thermodynamics in ads spacetime which is dual to that of a field theory in one dimension fewer @xcite . besides , an interesting development in the black holes studies comes from the fact that black holes are akin to thermodynamical system which can be essentially described by the laws of thermodynamics re - expressed in terms of properties of black holes @xcite .",
    "scientific researches in the black hole physics have presented a very deep and fundamental relationship between quantum gravity , holography and thermodynamics . among these researches ,",
    "the special interest is attracted by ads black holes because some of them lead to the very interesting phenomenon called hawking - page phase transition @xcite .",
    "phase transition plays an important role in order to explore thermodynamical properties of a system near the critical point .",
    "usually , phase transitions are denoted by a discontinuity of a state space variable , specially heat capacity @xcite .    motivated by large applications of the geometrical concept of thermodynamics in the black hole phase transition , in this paper , we investigate strengths and shortcomings of different approaches toward the matter .",
    "first attempt was done by weinhold @xcite which introduced a metric on the space of equilibrium states where its components are given as the hessian of the internal energy .",
    "then , ruppeiner introduced a metric which is defined as the negative hessian of entropy with respect to the internal energy and other extensive quantities of a thermodynamical system @xcite .",
    "it was shown that these two metrics are conformally equivalent to each other where the temperature is the conformal factor @xcite . recently ,",
    "quevedo @xcite proposed a legendre invariant metric , in which solved some of problems in weinhold / ruppeiner methods .",
    "the basic motivation for considering the geometrothermodynamics comes from the fact that this formalism describes in an invariant way the thermodynamic properties of a given thermodynamical system in terms of geometric structures .",
    "although extracting phase transition in terms of curvature singularity is the main reason to consider the geometrical approach in thermodynamics , there are several examples in which the curvature singularities of the known metrics ( weinhold and ruppeiner metrics and their legendre transformations ) are not located at the phase transition points and they have number of singularities in which are before / after the phase transition points @xcite .    in this paper , in order to solve the mentioned problems , we introduce a metric where its curvature singularities are , exactly , located at the phase transition points .",
    "as we see later , this effective metric has different structure from the other known metrics .",
    "for this claim , we consider the black hole solutions with born - infeld ( bi ) and maxwell sources in three and four dimensions and investigate phase transitions in various geometrothermodynamical methods .",
    "in order to investigate the local stability of a black hole , one can use various methods related to different ensembles . in principle thermal stability can be carried out in the grand canonical ensemble by finding the determinant of the hessian matrix of @xmath0 with respect to its extensive variables @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "for static charged black holes , we usually regard the mass @xmath2 as a function of the entropy @xmath3 and the charge @xmath4 .",
    "the number of thermodynamic variables depends on the ensemble that is used .",
    "the most well known approach for studying phase transition is in the context of canonical ensemble , hence the heat capacity of systems .",
    "depending on the number of extensive parameters , the behavior of hessian matrix is highly sensitive @xcite and therefore most of physicists prefer to work in canonical ensemble . in this ensemble ,",
    "the positivity of the heat capacity is sufficient to ensure thermal stability .",
    "in addition the system is considered to be in fixed charged and the heat capacity has the following form @xmath5where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are regular functions .",
    "now we regard two different types of phase transitions . in type one ,",
    "the changes in signature of the heat capacity is representing a phase transition .",
    "in other words , the roots of the heat capacity in this case are representing phase transition points which means one should solve @xmath8 .",
    "phase transition concerning to the divergency of the heat capacity is denoted by type two .",
    "it means the singular points of the heat capacity are representing the phase transitions .",
    "thus , we should consider @xmath9 to obtain the phase transition of type two .    in order to have a fitting geometrical approach for studying phase transitions , the thermodynamical ricci scalar ( trs ) must",
    "diverges in the mentioned both types of phase transitions . in what follows ,",
    "we present a brief review study of several geometrical approaches with their shortcomings , and then , we propose a new effective metric concerning this issue .",
    "in weinhold method , one is considering appropriate extensive parameters such as entropy , electric charge and angular momentum , and their related intensive quantities such as temperature , electric potential and angular velocity with the mass of the black holes as a potential .",
    "the weinhold metric is given by @xcite @xmath10where @xmath11 and also @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes other extensive variables of the system .",
    "considering a static charged black hole , one can find the following expression for the denominator of weinhold ricci scalar @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 and for consistency ( with respect to the heat capacity results ) , the roots of the eq .",
    "( [ denwein ] ) should coincide with two types of the mentioned phase transitions in the heat capacity .",
    "it is easy to find that due to the structure of the eq .",
    "( [ denwein ] ) , only in special case @xmath17 and nonzero @xmath18 , the divergence points of the heat capacity coincide with divergencies of the weinhold ricci scalar . in order to obtain consistent results for the type one phase transition",
    ", the following fine tuning must be hold @xmath19    regarding various case studies and calculating @xmath2 and its derivatives , we should note that eq .",
    "( [ ftw ] ) is not always satisfied .",
    "in addition , it is evident that for the case of @xmath20 , there will be extra divergencies for @xmath21 which are not related to any phase transition of the heat capacity .",
    "therefore , the structure of this part of denominator is in a way that may present extra divergencies that do not coincide with any type of phase transition points of the heat capacity .",
    "the ruppeiner metric is defined as @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it was proved that weinhold and ruppeiner metrics are related to each other by a legendre transformation @xcite",
    "@xmath25    applying this transformation , one can find the following relation for the denominator of the ricci scalar for this case @xmath26    this equation shows that the phase transitions of the heat capacity coincide with the singularities of ruppeiner ricci scalar only when @xmath27 and nonzero @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , regarding type one phase transitions , one finds due to existence of the @xmath28 and the fact that @xmath29 , the roots of the heat capacity and some of the divergence points of ruppeiner ricci scalar coincide . on the other hand",
    ", there may be some divergence points of @xmath30 that do not coincide with phase transition points .",
    "these extra phase transition points are originated from the zeroes of @xmath31 . as we mentioned before , in the case of @xmath27 , type two phase transitions of the heat capacity ( @xmath9 ) are covered by divergencies of the ricci scalar of the ruppeiner metric .",
    "but in this case , we encounter with extra divergencies related to the roots of @xmath32 which are not related to any phase transition of the heat capacity . in addition ,",
    "in the case of nonzero @xmath33 , the possible real roots of @xmath34 lead to the same extra divergencies , which were observed in weinhold metric .",
    "in order to remove the failures of the weinhold and ruppeiner metrics , quevedo proposed a new thermodynamical metric .",
    "the quevedo metric can be written as @xcite @xmath35 where the ( conformal ) function @xmath36 has one of the following forms @xmath37    in order to obtain the curvature singularity of the quevedo metric , we calculate the ricci scalar . although calculation of the ricci scalar is straightforward , analytically calculated results are too large .",
    "so , for the sake of brevity we do not write the long equations of the ricci scalar ; instead , we can use numerical analysis and some plots to investigate the ricci scalar s behavior .",
    "in addition , since we are looking for the divergence points of the ricci scalars , we can study the denominator of the ricci scalars with the following explicit forms @xmath38@xmath39    due to @xmath40 being in the denominator of both quevedo ricci scalars , the divergencies of the heat capacity and quevedo ricci scalars coincide . regarding type one phase transition ,",
    "although the roots of the heat capacity and divergencies of the quevedo ricci scalar of case ii coincide , for case i this coincidence takes place only for vanishing @xmath41 ( which is in general a nonzero function ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention the fact that there exists an additional function @xmath42 , and its roots provides extra singular points for both cases of quevedo ricci scalars .",
    "although @xmath41 and @xmath43 are independent from each other , generally , for a nonzero @xmath41 in the case i , it may be possible to set @xmath44 for special choices of free parameters .",
    "in this situation , one finds another divergence point which may not coincide with any phase transition points of the heat capacity .",
    "in order to avoid extra singular points in trs which do not coincide with phase transitions of any type , and also to ensure all divergencies of the trs coincide with phase transition points of the both types , we introduce the following new thermodynamical metric @xmath45    it is worthwhile to mention that the new thermodynamical metric is defined the same as the quevedo metric with different conformal function . in new metric , we have considered the total mass as thermodynamical potential with entropy and electric charge as extensive parameters . in order to find the geometrical behavior of new thermodynamical metric",
    ", we calculate the ricci scalar .",
    "it is a straightforward calculation to show that the numerator and the denominator of trs for this new metric is , respectively , @xmath46sm_{qq}^{2}m_{s}m_{sqq}-9s^{2}m_{qqq}^{2}m_{s}^{2}m_{ss}^{2 }   \\notag \\\\ & & + 4\\left [ \\frac{1}{4}m_{sq}m_{ss}+m_{s}m_{ssq}\\right ] s^{2}m_{qq}m_{s}m_{qqq}+\\left [ s^{2}m_{s}^{2}m_{ssq}-s^{2}m_{sq}m_{ss}m_{s}m_{ssq}\\right .",

    "smooth function is often used technically to mean a function that has derivatives of all orders everywhere in its domain .",
    "therefore , one may take into account that @xmath2 has regular derivatives of all orders with respect to the extensive parameters @xcite .",
    "taking into account the regular numerator of trs in eq .",
    "( [ numnew ] ) with the denominator of trs , eq .",
    "( [ dennew ] ) , we ensure that all the phase transition points of the type one and two coincide with divergencies of the mentioned trs and there is no extra term that may provide extra divergencies .    we should note that , in general , the derivatives of all orders of @xmath2 ( such as @xmath18 , @xmath40 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and so on ) are independent from each other .",
    "in addition , we should mention that for the case of vanishing @xmath43 or @xmath40 , the numerator of trs has nonzero value , but denominator of trs vanishes . in the case of @xmath51 , although it is clear that both numerator and denominator vanish , the denominator approaches zero faster than the numerator .",
    "therefore , one concludes that when @xmath43 and/or @xmath40 go to zero , trs diverges .    in order to elaborate the efficiency of the newly proposed metric and shortcomings of the previously proposed metrics , we study two cases of the bi black holes in three and four dimensions .",

    "it was seen that the behavior of trs for divergence points related to two types of the phase transition is different .",

    "recently , it was seen and proposed that different constants ( such as cosmological constant , bi nonlinearity parameter , gauss - bonnet parameter , newton constant and etc . ) may vary and have contribution to thermodynamical structure of the system @xcite .",
    "in other words , in case of black holes , the total mass of the black hole is a function of these parameters as extensive parameters",
    ". it will be interesting to reconsider these constants as thermodynamical variables and modify trs of the mentioned geometrothermodynamical methods .",
    "although this modification changes trs of various methods , it does not cause inconsistent results for new generalized metric .    the approach that we introduced in this paper enable one to map the divergence points of its trs with phase transition points without any concern regarding contribution of other terms and extra divergence points .",
    "this method may also be employed to study phase transition of other non gravitating systems .",

    "<S> next , we introduce a new metric to solve these problems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the denominator of the ricci scalar of the new metric contains terms which coincide with different types of phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we elaborate the effectiveness of the new metric and shortcomings of the previous metrics with some examples . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find a characteristic behavior of the new thermodynamical ricci scalar which enables one to distinguish two types of phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we generalize the new metric for the cases of more than two extensive parameters and show that in these cases the divergencies of thermodynamical ricci scalar coincide with phase transition points of the heat capacity . </S>"
