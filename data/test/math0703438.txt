    "recently there has been a considerable interest in trying to obtain atomic decompositions of the space @xmath6 .",
    "these decompositions are usually obtained in terms of frames generated by a family of functions translated on a regular grid , and dilated by powers of a dilation matrix .",
    "the uniformity of the grid and the structure of the dilations can be exploited to obtain very sharp results . for irregular grids and unstructured dilations or",
    "if dilations are replaced by other transformations the situation is more complex and requires different techniques .",
    "one method is to use the regular case and try to obtain perturbations of the grid that preserve the frame structure .",
    "another possibility is to obtain irregular samples of the continuous transform , that have the required properties .    in this article",
    "we study frame decompositions of the space @xmath4 using translations of a family of functions on irregular grids , and arbitrary dilations , and we even replace dilations by other transformations .",
    "our approach is different and very general , allowing quite general constructions .",
    "we prove the existence of smooth time - frequency frame atoms in several variables .",
    "the setting includes as particular cases , wavelet frames on irregular lattices and with a set of dilations or transformations that do not have a group structure .",
    "another particular case are non - harmonic gabor frames with non - uniform covering of the euclidean space .",
    "it also leads to new constructions of wavelet and gabor frames with regular lattice translates .",
    "one of the nice features of the proposed method is that it unifies different atomic decompositions .",
    "for the case of regular lattices guido weiss and his group @xcite developed a very fundamental program to characterize a large class of decompositions of @xmath4 through certain equations that the generators must satisfy .",
    "this is an important attempt to unify gabor and wavelets decompositions .",

    "we want to stress here that our constructions are much more general , allowing for example a different invertible ( not necessarily expansive ) matrix @xmath15 for each @xmath16 for the case of orthogonal wavelets , yang wang @xcite has recently considered wavelet sets associated with arbitrary families of invertible matrices and irregular sets of translates .",
    "he gave conditions for the existence of such wavelet sets and related them to spectral pairs .",

    "the approach in this article can be considered in the spirit of the classic construction in 1 dimension of smooth regular tight frames done by daubechies , grossmann and meyer in @xcite .",
    "they found , for the case of uniform lattices , general conditions on a compactly supported smooth function @xmath17 , in order that it generates a tight gabor frame of @xmath18 . in the affine case they found necessary and sufficient conditions for a band limited function in order that it generates a smooth wavelet frame .",
