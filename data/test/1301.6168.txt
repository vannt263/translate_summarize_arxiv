    "the study of the formation , composition , mass and kinematics of galaxy halos are among the most active areas of modern astrophysical research . the formation of galaxy halos are now widely believed to be due to hierarchical structure formation ( e.g. , freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) where galaxies are produced by the combination of a monolithic collapse ( eggen et al .  1962 ) and the accretion of galactic fragments ( searle and zinn 1978 ) . for the halo of the milky way",
    ", all aspects of the halo can probed by studying the nature of the remnants of disrupted dwarf galaxies .",
    "numerous tidal streams and dwarf galaxies have been discovered within the galactic halo in the last 20 years ( e.g. , ibata et al .",
    "1994 ; ibata et al .  2001 ; vivas et al .  2001 ; grillmair 2006 ; newberg et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the most well - studied of these is the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( sgr , ibata et al .",
    "1994 ) and its associated tidal stream .",
    "the sgr streams have been traced on large scales using blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars ( newberg et al . 2003 ) , m - giants ( majewski et al .",
    "2003 ) , and main - sequence turn off ( msto ) stars ( e.g. , belokurov et al .",
    "2006 ; koposov et al .",
    "the sgr system has also been studied using rr lyrae ( rrl , vivas & zinn 2006 ; miceli et al .",
    "2008 ; sesar et al .",
    "2010 ) . other halo streams and structures discovered recently include a virgo stellar stream ( vss ; vivas & zinn 2006 ; vivas et al .",
    "2008 ) , a virgo overdensity ( vod , newberg et al . 2002",
    "; newberg et al .",
    "2007 ) , an overdensity in pisces ( sesar et al .  2007 ; kollmeier et al .",
    "2009 ) and a monoceros stream ( newberg et al . 2002 ; majewski et al .",
    "additionally , a cetus stream has been discovered in the south ( newberg et al .",
    "2009 ; koposov et al .",
    "2012 ) and also evidence for an overdensity dubbed the hercules - aquila cloud ( belokurov et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "although the sgr stream system has been the focus of much study , since the structure is extends completely around the galaxy , it is yet to be fully mapped in velocity , metallicity and distance .",
    "furthermore , the cause of the bifurcation in sgr stream stars discovered by belokurov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is yet to be explained .",
    "additionally , newberg et al .  ( 2003 ) proposed the existence of a stream of stars associated with the sgr dwarf galaxy at galactocentric distances of @xmath3 .",
    "these authors photometrically identified candidate bhb stars in sdss data and found evidence for an overdensity of stars with @xmath4 .",
    "this overdensity was found using sdss data covering @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "newberg et al .  ( 2003 ) attributed this feature to a trailing arm of the sgr stream , yet also noted a possible link to the globular cluster ngc  2419 .",
    "their analysis showed evidence for a feature visible across @xmath7 along the sgr plane .",
    "newberg et al .  ( 2007 ) continued this work and found additional evidence for what they called the sgr trailing tail using bhb candidates selected from sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ; alderman - mccarthy et al .",
    "more recently , ruhland et al .  ( 2011 ) found additional evidence for this overdensity using candidate bhb stars selected from the larger sdss dr7 dataset .",
    "as with newberg et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2007 ) , these authors found a stream of bhb candidates to be located at heliocentric distances of 60 - 80 kpc with @xmath8 significance . within their analysis the feature was seen to span @xmath9 of the sky in the region @xmath10 .",
    "ruhland et al .",
    "( 2011 ) also compared this extended stream with five sets of published numerical simulations of the sgr stream .",
    "they found that none were able to explain the existence of sgr stream stars in the location observed .",
    "current evidence for an outer sgr stream / tidal - tail remains based purely on photometrically selected bhb stars .",
    "as demonstrated by sirko et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and ruhland et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , it is not possible to select a 100% pure set of bhb stars using sdss photometry alone .",
    "depending on the colour cuts used one has to accept varying levels of contamination blue straggler ( bs ) stars which far out number bhb stars at the greatest detection completeness . with strict colour cuts , that remove a large fraction of the bhb stars ,",
    "the level of bs star contamination can be reduced to 30% ( ruhland et al .",
    "however , to retain a large number of bhb stars , a 50% or greater contamination level must be accepted ( brown et al .  2005 ; bell et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "in contrast to photometric selection , it is possible to select bhb stars with much less contamination by combining colour selection with high s / n spectra because bhb stars have significantly lower surface gravity than the bs stars ( yanny et al .",
    "the sdss segue - i and segue - ii projects ( yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) undertook spectroscopy of @xmath0 300,000 star with an aim to identifying bhb stars and trace galactic halo structure .",
    "however , while radial velocities are available for stars to @xmath11 ( yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) , the s / n required to accurately measure @xmath12 limits the survey to bhb stars with @xmath13 ( @xmath14 kpc ) .",
    "almost all of the bhb candidates discovered by newberg et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2007 ) and ruhland et al .",
    "( 2011 ) are beyond this limit and do not have measurements of @xmath12 to confirm their nature .",
    "additionally , while the sdss segue surveys cover @xmath15 , the fields cover a patchwork over the northern sky , rather than just the sgr stream region where this feature is located .    like bhb stars ,",
    "rrl stars also exist on horizontal branch ( hb ) . however , unlike bhb stars , rrl exhibit a significant level of intrinsic photometric variability . based on their characteristic variability rrl",
    "can be cleanly separated from other stars .",
    "type - ab rrl stars ( rrab ) have absolute magnitudes of @xmath16 with uncertainties of 6% ( catelan et al .",
    "this makes them excellent distance indicators .",
    "although , significant numbers of repeated observations are required to provide accurate average magnitudes .    to date , a few tens of thousands of rrl are known in dense regions near the galactic bulge and in the magellanic clouds due to microlensing surveys ( soszyski et al .",
    "2009 , pietrukowicz et al .",
    "recently we discovered @xmath0 10,000 rrab over a large fraction of the sky ( drake et al .",
    "2013 ; dr13 ) . however ,",
    "even with the dr13 rrab s most of the galactic halo remains unexplored at heliocentric distances @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    "we outline our search , discovery , and calibration of rrl at distances up to 100 kpc and beyond .",
    "we will compare our discoveries with results from past surveys and undertake an analysis of the distant hb stars uncovered .",
    "the catalina sky survey began in 2004 and uses three telescopes to cover the sky between declination @xmath18 and @xmath19 in order to discover near earth objects ( neos ) and potential hazardous asteroids ( larson et al .",
    "the three telescopes are each considered sub - surveys .",
    "these consist of the catalina schmidt survey ( css ) , the mount lemmon survey ( mls ) and the siding spring survey ( sss ) .",
    "in addition to avoiding high declinations , the galactic plane region is avoided by between 10 and 15 degrees due to reduced source recovery in crowded stellar regions .",
    "all of the survey images are taken in sequences of four observations separated by ten minutes , and all the observations are unfiltered to maximize throughput .",
    "photometry is carried out using the aperture photometry program sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "all the catalina data is also analyzed for transient sources by the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts , drake et al .",
    "2009 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "2011 ) .    in paper - i ( dr13 ) , we concentrated on analyzing rrab data from the css sub - survey . in this paper",
    "we mainly work with data observed by the mls 1.5 m telescope .",
    "this data predominately covers ecliptic latitudes @xmath20 . for this telescope each image from the @xmath21 catalina ccd camera covers 1.1 @xmath22 on the sky .",
    "observations are taken 21 nights per lunation avoiding bright time .",
    "typical exposures of 30 seconds to reach @xmath23 . in total , the mls source catalog consists of 155 million sources .",
    "as noted in dr13 , the mls data has the same photometric sensitivity as the css data since all observations are taken unfiltered with the same type of ccd camera .",
    "all images are processed with the same software . from dr13 , the colour transformation from catalina photometric system @xmath24 magnitudes to johnson @xmath25",
    "is given by :    @xmath26    the average b - v colour of rrl is about 0.3 mag with stars varying between about 0.1 and 0.5 as they pulsate ( e.g. , clube et al .",
    "1969 ; stepien 1972 ; cacciari et al . 1987",
    "; layden 1997 ; nemec 2004 ) .",
    "as the mls data has no colour information , we adopt the average values in our analysis .",
    "this gives rise to an maximum uncertainty of @xmath27 mags in the @xmath25 magnitudes . combining this with the photometric uncertainty",
    ", we expect a colour - based dispersion of @xmath28 mags in our rrl photometry .      to find rrl candidates we follow the analysis undertaken in dr13 .",
    "that is , we first selected variable sources using a welch - stetson variability index @xmath29 ( welch & stetson 1993 ) .",
    "3.1 million mls sources were selected as variable candidates using @xmath30 .",
    "all sources were processed for periodicity using the lomb - scargle ( ls , lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ) periodograms . in total @xmath31 thousand sources",
    "were found to exhibit significant periodicity with a false alarm probability @xmath32",
    ". however , the bulk of these detections are due to the systematic sampling of the data and occur at integer day frequencies .    here , as with dr13 , we are primarily interested in rrab s since they have well known magnitudes and characteristic light curves that are not easily mistaken for other periodic variables . after excluding the period aliases near 0.5 and 1 day , 3087 of the objects found to have periods between 0.34 and 1.4 days .",
    "this period region was deliberately chosen to be broader than the rrab range in order to include sources found by the ls technique at aliases of their true periods .",
    "as with the css sources of dr13 , each of the rrab candidate was run through the afd software ( torreabla et al .",
    "2012 ) to select the best period from among the best 15 given by the ls and aov software ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1989 ) .",
    "briefly , this process involves fourier fitting and iteratively rejecting bad data to determine the best period based on reduced @xmath33 values .",
    "non - rrab sources are rejected using the m - test statistic ( kinemuchi et al ,  2006 ; equation 8) , as well as the fourier fit order .",
    "this initial selection resulted in the detection of 1125 rrab candidates .      upon reviewing the light curves of the rrab candidates we discovered a number of faint rrab in the mls data with @xmath34 .",
    "such rrl were found to be mainly concentrated in the gemini constellation . in figure",
    "[ mlsrrab ] , we plot the phased light curves of eight of these faint stars .",

    ", we discovered that our detection sensitivity was @xmath35 for rrab s with @xmath36 .    to improve our completeness",
    "we investigated the light curves of mls sources with sdss spectroscopic types a0 and f5 that had @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , we used sdss photometry to select stars with the same colour range as the rrab stars that we had discovered .",
    "these stars were matched with mls sources at lower variability and periodicity thresholds ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) to select rrab candidates .",
    "to better constrain the variability , we combined the mls photometry with shallower css data .",
    "likewise , we searched the css data for additional faint rrab candidates by selecting objects with rrab colours in sdss photometry . furthermore , since our analysis in dr13 showed that @xmath40 of rrab s were missed because the selection based on ls periods , we reprocessed the css and mls photometry using the aov period - finding software .",
    "we inspected the light curve of each rrl candidate to assess variability and then carried out period finding for all the new variable candidates . in total , approximately six thousand additional sources were searched .",
    "each of the new sources exhibiting some sign of periodicity were searched for improved periods using our fourier - fitting afd process . in a number of cases the rrl",
    "were found to exhibit blazhko phase and amplitude variations ( blazhko 1907 ) .",
    "in total the additional searches yielded an 219 extra mls rrl and 2051 css rrab s .",

    ". brighter foreground field rrab s are likely to have higher metallicities .",
    "the mls rrab s should have a similar metallicity distribution to the larger sample of css sources discovered in dr13 .",

    "like the mls survey , the sekbo survey covered a band within @xmath58 of the ecliptic .",

    "in contrast , the mls rrab candidates are observed unfiltered and have an average of 130 observations ( sampling ranges from 42 to 342 measurements ) .",
    "we matched the mls rrab with the sekbo rrl candidates and found only 103 matches .",
    "however , this is not unexpected since the sampling of mls is highly concentrated within few degrees of the ecliptic with few observations having been taken near the @xmath59 limit .",
