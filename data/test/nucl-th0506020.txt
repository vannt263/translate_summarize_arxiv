    "due to the lack of eta beams , the @xmath0-nucleon/@xmath0-nucleus interaction is still not as clear as that of the pion - nucleon / pion - nucleus and kaon - nucleon / kaon - nucleus . since the @xmath0-nucleus quasi - bound states were first predicted by haider and liu @xcite and li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , when it was realized that the @xmath0-nucleon interaction is attractive , the study of the @xmath0-nucleus bound states has been one of the focuses in nuclear physics @xcite .",
