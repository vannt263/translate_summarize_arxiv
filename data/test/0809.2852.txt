    "the recent rekindled interest in scalar fields , describing spin-0 particles , in the relativistic theory of gravitation stems from their potential role in solving some of the outstanding issues in cosmology .",
    "two such issues are related to the accelerated expansion of the universe : one during its earlier evolution associated with very high energy scales and another during the much later period of evolution ( more precisely at the present epoch ) with much lower energy scale . in both the cases ,",
    "a slowly varying energy density of a scalar field @xmath0 can mimick an effective cosmological constant .",
    "this in turn can result in the violation of the strong energy condition causing accelerated expansion .",
    "the most widely studied scalar fields in cosmology are minimally coupled i.e the contribution from the scalar field can be separated from gravity ( the ricci scalar @xmath1 to be precise ) and other matter fields in the action . in such realistic scalar field models describing an accelerated expansion of the universe , one requires a potential @xmath2 for the scalar field which drives the acceleration .",
    "this scalar field which is responsible for the early time accelerated expansion of the universe , is called the inflaton .",
    "there are a large number of investigations regarding the role of scalar fields in inflationary cosmology and subsequently its role in creating the initial fluctuations in the universe .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein for this purpose .",
    "on the other hand , the discovery of the late time acceleration of the universe around the end of last century , is one of the most puzzling and daunting phenomena in recent times .",
    "first discovered by two different groups around 1999@xcite , by observing supernova type ia explosions which are quite abundant in our universe , it has subsequently been confirmed by more recent supernova type - ia observations by different groups@xcite and indirectly confirmed by cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) observations@xcite and also observing the galaxy clustering by large scale redshift surveys@xcite .    to explain such phenomena , one needs to add an extra component in the energy budget of the universe , which has a large negative pressure and also dominates over all other components e.g. non - relativistic matter , radiation etc .",
    "this missing component is termed as `` dark energy '' in the literature .",
    "one optimistic choice for this dark energy can be a minimally coupled scalar field slowly rolling down its considerably flat potential @xcite .",
    "such a scalar field is also known as `` quintessence''@xcite .",
    "it is similar to the inflaton field mentioned above , but evolving in a much lower energy scale . to make the evolution of these scalar fields independent of the initial conditions , a particular class of models known as `` tracker quintessence models ''",
    "has been proposed @xcite , where a late time accelerating regime can be reached from a variety of initial conditions making these models more appealing .",
    "these type of scalar fields have both scaling as well as attractor property .",
    "they mimic the background matter component at early times and its late time attractor phase is accelerating which can also be stable @xcite .",
    "tracker quintessence models with different types potential have been widely studied in recent times and their observational signatures have also been explored ( see @xcite for a nice review ) .",
    "although minimally coupled scalar field models are interesting possibilities in modelling dark energy , one needs to do some degree of fine tuning involving the parameters of the potential .",
    "scalar tensor theories are generalization of the minimally coupled scalar field theories in a sense that here the scalar field is non - minimally coupled with the gravity sector of the action i.e with the ricci scalar @xmath1 . in these theories ,",
    "the scalar field participates in the gravitational interaction , unlike its counterpart in the minimally coupled case where it behaves as a non gravitational source like any other matter field .",
    "such a scalar partner for gravity which has a tensorial nature in general , can naturally arise in attempts at quantizing gravity or its unification with other fundamental forces in nature .",
    "superstring theory is one such possibility where one encounters dilaton field which is non minimally coupled with the gravity sector .",
    "the reason that this non minimally coupled scalar field theory is one of the most natural alternatives to general relativity ( gr ) is also due to the fact that these theories respect most of the symmetries in gr like local lorentz invariance , energy - momentum conservation etc .",
    "although a long range scalar field as a gravitational field was first introduced by jordan@xcite , this kind of non minimally coupled scalar field actually attracted the attention of the researchers when brans and dicke invoked such a field in order to incorporate the mach s principle in general theory of relativity@xcite .",
    "brans - dicke ( bd ) theory , where the scalar field is directly coupled to the ricci scalar , has the merit of producing results which can be compared with the corresponding gr results against observations@xcite .",
    "a further important virtue of bd theory is that it is believed to produce the gr in a particular limit(see @xcite for a different result ) .",
    "the possibility of having late time acceleration of the universe with a non minimally coupled scalar field ( _ a.k.a _ scalar tensor theories ) has also been explored in great detail@xcite .",
    "scaling attractor solutions with non minimally coupled scalar fields have been studied with both exponential and power law potentials@xcite .",
    "faraoni @xcitehas also studied with a non minimal coupling term @xmath3 with different scalar field potentials for the late time acceleration .",
    "bertolo _ et al._@xcite , bertolami _",
    "et al._@xcite , ritis _",
    "et al._@xcite have found tracking solutions in scalar tensor theories with different types of potential . in another work ,",
    "sen and seshadri@xcite have obtained suitable scalar field potential to obtain power law acceleration of the universe .",
    "saini _ et al._@xcite and boisseau _ et al._@xcite have reconstructed the potential for a non minimally coupled scalar field from the luminosity - redshift relation available from the observations .",
    "attempts have also been made to obtain an accelerating universe at present by introducing a coupling between the normal matter field and the brans - dicke field in a generalised scalar tensor theory@xcite .",
    "but the form of coupling chosen was ad - hoc and did not follow from any fundamental theory .",
    "non - minimally coupled scalar field theories giving rise to the late time acceleration of the universe have been confronted with observational results like cmb anisotropies or growth of matter perturbations@xcite .    in recent years , an alternative possibility of having an effective scalar field theory governed by a lagrangian containing a non canonical kinetic term @xmath4 where @xmath5 has been proposed .",
    "one of the most studied forms for @xmath6 is @xmath7 .",
    "this form for the lagrangian is called the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) form .",
    "such a model can lead to late time acceleration of the universe and popularly called `` k - essence '' in literature @xcite .",
    "this field can also give rise to inflation in early universe and is called `` k - inflation''@xcite .",
    "this type of field can naturally arise in string theory@xcite and can be very interesting in cosmological context@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we have considered non minimally coupled scalar fields having a non canonical kinetic term of dbi form .",
    "we have investigated both the early time evolution of the universe when it is dominated only by the scalar field , as well as its late time evolution when it is sourced by both matter field and scalar field .",
    "we have studied under what condition one can obtain an inflationary phase at the early times as well as an accelerating phase at late times .",
    "we have also studied the attractor properties of the solutions .",
    "we should mention that such a model was earlier considered by @xcite and @xcite in the context of slow - roll inflation .",
    "the action for a scalar tensor theory where a scalar field having a standard canonical kinetic term is non minimally coupled with the gravity sector is given by @xcite    @xmath8    here @xmath9 denotes the gravitational coupling constant , @xmath1 is the ricci scalar , @xmath10 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are dimensionless .",
    "@xmath12 has to be positive for graviton to carry positive energy .",
    "we now modify the action assuming the kinetic term for the scalar field @xmath0 of dbi form .",
    "taking care of all dimensional and dimensionless quantities , one can now rewrite the action as    @xmath14.\\ ] ]    here we have introduced two parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 to make the action dimensionally correct .",
    "@xmath15 has the dimension of @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath16 has the dimension of @xmath17^{-2}$ ] .",
    "varying the action ( 2 ) with respect to the metric tensor , one gets the field equation as :    @xmath18\\nonumber\\\\   & + & { ( f(\\phi))_{,\\nu ; \\mu}\\over{f(\\phi ) } } -{g_{\\mu\\nu}\\box f(\\phi)\\over{f(\\phi)}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above equations are written in so called `` jordon frame '' .",
    "however , it is much simpler to tackle the system of equations in `` einstein frame '' where one can break the coupling between the scalar field @xmath0 and the ricci scalar @xmath1 .",
    "this can be achieved through a conformal transformation of the form @xmath19 . in this einstein frame",
    ", the action ( 2 ) becomes @xmath20;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath21 .",
    "the action is identical with that for a minimally coupled tachyon field @xmath0 with a potential @xmath22 except for * the extra @xmath23 term which arises due to the non - minimal coupling*. we should point out that for a scalar field with canonical kinetic term , the action in the einstein frame is exactly similar to the corresponding case in minimally coupled theory except the changed form of the potential which we discuss in the next paragraph .",
    "but otherwise the form of the action is exactly the same .",
    "but with a non canonical kinetic term , in the einstein frame , one extra term gets generated . in other words ,",
    "this type of non minimal coupling that we consider here , always generates a correction to @xmath24 which are of the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 when transformed to the einstein frame .",
    "this is a new feature for non minimally coupled k - essence field and can play important role in cosmological models .",
    "one point of caution is that , these models are only stable under quantum corrections as long as the non - minimal coupling term @xmath12 and its variation is small.for this minimally coupled case , the dbi form of the kinetic term is protected under the five dimensional lorentz invariance .",
    "if this extra term that appears in the minimally coupled einstein frame , is large , then this symmetry is strongly broken and will effect significant correction in @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "another interesting feature is that even though one starts with a constant potential @xmath27 in the original jordon frame , in the einstein frame it becomes @xmath28 .",
    "this is similar to `` extended inflation '' scenario@xcite , where the constant potential for the inflaton field in its false vacuum state , gets modified to exponential potential due to the conformal transformation .",
    "this results much slower power law inflation for the universe solving some of the problems present in the original guth s model of inflation@xcite .",
    "although this model has its own problem , non minimal coupling and subsequent conformal transformation play a crucial role for the initial success of this model .",
    "next we assume a homogeneous and isotropic universe described by a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime .",
    "it is given by the spacetime metric @xmath29\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is scale factor of the universe .",
    "one also has to assume the form for @xmath12 for further calculations .",
    "one of the most studied forms in the literature is @xmath31 which is also called the brans - dicke ( bd ) form@xcite .",
    "the original motivation for the bd theory was to implement the mach principle in relativistic theory of gravity .",
    "this was done by promoting the newton s constant to the role of a dynamical field determined by the environment .",
    "later on , it was shown that the low energy limit of the bosonic string theory is indeed similar to the bd theory for some particular parameter value@xcite . moreover",

    "we have also assumed @xmath35 .",
    "one can further redefine the scalar field to have a more simpler equation .",

    "we first investigate whether the solution for this system of equations is sensitive to the initial condition .",

    "it always has a late time attractor .",
    "this feature is crucial in order to have a reliable inflationary model whose predictions should not depend on the initial conditions .",
    "= 3.2truein    next we show the behaviour of the hubble parameter @xmath51 for different values of the parameter @xmath50 in figure 3 .",
    "one can see for all the cases , it starts with an inflationary era ( showing @xmath51 = constant ) and then exits from this inflationary phase .",
    "the time of exit depends on the parameter @xmath50 in a sense that lower values of @xmath50 causes the exit at later time .",
    "so one can tune the parameter @xmath50 to get sufficient number of e - folding to solve the horizon or flatness problem .",
    "next we consider the potential @xmath52 in the action ( 2 ) .",

    "similar to the constant potential case , described above , one can study the variation of the hubble parameter with time .",

    "the duration for which this rapid expansion lasts , depends on the parameter @xmath16 with lower values of @xmath16 results larger duration for inflation .",

    "hence for this potential @xmath16 plays a crucial role for the attractor solution . as we mention before that we have assumed @xmath59 for this case . but with higher values of @xmath15 one can get attractor behaviour with smaller @xmath16 .",

    "in this section we consider the late time solution for the universe where it is dominated by a non - relativistic matter together with a non canonical scalar field which is non minimally coupled with the gravity sector .",
    "we call it `` non minimal k - essence ''",
    ".    there are different approaches for adding matter in scalar tensor theories .",
    "this is because of the ambiguity of representing the physical space - time structure : whether it belongs to the jordan frame or to einstein frame .",
    "and this ambiguity has an elaborate representation in the literature dealing with scalar tensor theories @xcite . choosing a physical frame is utmost important for theoretical investigations .",
    "also the physical metric should be singled out for the pure gravity only vacuum case and subsequently the matter field should be added . in a detail study ,",
    "magnano and sokolowski@xcite have argued in favour of einstein frame as a physical frame in scalar tensor theories .",
    "they showed that if a lagrangian in scalar tensor theory admits a flat space as a stable solution , then it is always equivalent to a scalar field with potential minimally coupled to conformally transformed metric .",
    "then any matter should be minimally coupled with the transformed metric and not with the scalar field .",
    "but this does not apply to theories where the coupling between the matter field and scalar field already exists in more fundamental theory . as an example , in string theory , the four dimensional effective action contains a number bosonic fields which couple both with the metric and the dilaton .",

    "we have also transformed our equations in einstein frame and they take the form ( assuming @xmath62 ) : @xmath63    = 3.2truein    where @xmath64 is the energy density in the einstein frame . the field @xmath39 and",

    "this is usual for the case where one incorporates matter in the jordan frame . in figure 9",
    "we show the behaviour of the hubble parameter @xmath51 as function of time for different values of the @xmath50 parameter .",

    "we have showed the behaviour of the energy densities for the matter and scalar field in figure 11 for @xmath68 .",
    "it shows that although matter dominates the energy budget at early time , but eventually the scalar field takes over and starts dominating .",
    "next we add matter in the einstein frame i.e we consider the physical metric for pure gravity for vacuum in einstein frame and then add matter in it .",
    "the action now becomes : @xmath20 + s_{matter}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we write the field equations in this case and they take the form ( assuming @xmath31 ) : @xmath69    the field @xmath39 and the constant @xmath50 are defined in section ii .",

    "but one needs to have low @xmath50 to get the acceleration , in comparison to the previous case where we add matter in jordan frame .",
    "we also study the phase portrait in @xmath46 plane in figure 13 .",
    "it also shows the attractor behaviour . in this case the range for @xmath50 for which one gets the attractor property is wider than the previous one .",
    "the behaviours of the two energy densities are also shown in figure 14 . in this case also , although the matter dominates in the early time , the scalar field starts dominating in the late time resulting acceleration .",
    "in this work , we have considered a k - field having dbi - type kinetic term , which is non minimally coupled with gravity .",
    "the coupling term is of bd type i.e @xmath31 in the action .",

    "our main aim is to check , whether it is possible to have a epoch of accelerated expansion either in early time or in late time .",
    "our results show that with proper choice of parameters , it is possible to have both inflation and late time acceleration in this model .",
    "more over we have shown that these solutions show attractor property in a sense that they do not depend on the initial conditions . for the inflation case ,",
    "we have considered both the constant potential and potential inspired from the bsft theories , in our original action in jordan frame .",
    "but in the einstein frame , where we study the solutions , the potentials get modified .",
    "moreover the r.h.s of the field equations ( eqns 10 and 11 ) , contains an extra term which is due to the non minimal coupling .",
    "this term is completely new and does not occur in the corresponding minimally coupled case",
    ". it can play an important role specially for models where one can have a fast roll inflationary phase .",
    "as our results show , this model can have interesting cosmological implications .",
    "we have shown that the model allows an inflationary phase .",
    "one has to now apply it to a more realistic inflationary scenario ( so called slow - roll model ) , and study the implications , e.g. whether it allows sufficient e - folding , what is the power spectrum for this k - field and whether that matches with the observations .",
    "scalar field with dbi type kinetic term minimally coupled with gravity has already been considered for possible inflaton field@xcite .",

    "we have shown that the model also allows a late time accelerating phase , when the universe is sourced by matter together with the k - field .",
    "one has to now make a detailed study regarding the observational aspects of this model .    to summarise , non - minimally coupled k - field is an attractive model for cosmological purpose for both inflation and late time accelerating universe .",
