    "while it has been generally accepted for quite some time that upon approaching the glass transition the liquid s dynamics become increasingly heterogeneous @xcite , theoretical descriptions of various four - point correlation functions which quantify dynamic heterogeneity have been scarce @xcite .",
    "it has been only in the last few years that a number of different theoretical approaches to this problem appeared @xcite . according to one of these approaches @xcite , the divergent part of a four - point dynamic density correlation function , integrated over the whole space , can be expressed in terms of so - called three - point susceptibilities .",
    "these susceptibilities are defined as the derivatives of the usual two - point correlation function , _",
    "i.e. _ the intermediate scattering function , with respect to the densities of the conserved quantities . in the case of a colloidal system",
    "there is only one conserved quantity , the number of particles and thus there is only one susceptibility , the density derivative of the intermediate scattering function .",
    "the first goal of this note is to derive the equation of motion for this susceptibility within the mode - coupling approximation @xcite and to present numerical solutions of this equation .",
    "not surprisingly , the equation of motion for the the density derivative of the intermediate scattering function is essentially identical to that for the long - wave vector limit of the three - point susceptibility introduced by biroli _",
    "the latter susceptibility was defined as the derivative of the intermediate scattering function with respect to an external , inhomogeneous potential .",
    "it should be noted that while most theoretical approaches consider the full ( _ i.e. _ _ collective _ ) four - point dynamic density correlation function , in computer simulations usually the self part of this function is monitored @xcite .",
    "for this reason , while discussing the wave vector dependence of dynamic heterogeneities , berthier _ et al .",

    "@xcite the density derivative of the self - intermediate scattering function was calculated by solving the mode - coupling equation of motion for this function at different densities and then performing a numerical differentiation . numerical solution of the equation of motion for the density derivative of the self - intermediate scattering function allows us to investigate the wave vector at which , according to berthier _",
