    "starting from the 2007 crisis , one of the most striking features of today s financial environment is represented by the segmentation of interest rate markets . more specifically , while the pre - crisis interest rate market was well described by a _ single _",
    "yield curve and interbank xibor rates associated to different tenors were simply determined by no - arbitrage relations , nowadays the market is segmented in the sense that distinct yield curves are constructed from market instruments that depend on a specific tenor , thus giving rise to _ multiple _ yield curves .",
    "the credit and liquidity risks existing in the interbank market , which were perceived as negligible before the crisis , are at the origin of this phenomenon .",
    "this is also reflected by the emergence of spreads between ois rates and xibor rates as well as between xibor rates associated to different tenors .    in this paper",
    ", we propose the most general tractable approach based on affine processes to model multiple yield curves . in our view",
    ", it should be understood as _ the affine framework _ for this modeling purpose and not as a specific model class , such as the affine libor models considered in @xcite .",
    "we provide a unifying affine methodology within which all interest rate modeling approaches , i.e. , ( i ) short rate , ( ii ) libor market , and ( iii ) heath - jarrow - morton modeling , can be consolidated . on the one hand",
    ", this allows us to embed in our framework all affine multiple curve models proposed so far in the literature . on the other hand , the approach allows for novel developments , for instance multiple curve short rate models based on wishart processes as well as interest rate models under alternative numraires .",
    "moreover , the generality of the setting does not preclude tractability and appealing practical features , as will be made precise below .",
    "we model a general numraire process and , inspired by our previous work @xcite , _ multiplicative spreads _ between ( normalized ) spot xibor rates and ( normalized ) simply compounded ois rates . besides being directly observable from market quotes ,",
    "multiplicative spreads represent the most convenient modeling quantity in an affine setting and admit a natural interpretation in terms of forward exchange premia .",
    "we consider a general interest rate market where ois zero - coupon bonds and fra contracts are traded , for a finite set of tenors and for all maturities , and assume the existence of a numraire - martingale measure couple , thus ensuring absence of arbitrage in a sense precisely specified below .",
    "we then model the logarithm of the multiplicative spreads and of the numraire process as affine functions of an underlying affine process . in the special case where the numraire is chosen as the ois bank account",
    ", our framework can be regarded as the natural extension of classical affine short rate models to the multi - curve setting . in the special case where the numraire is chosen to be the ois bond with terminal maturity",
    ", we can recover an extension of the affine libor market model of @xcite .",
    "the proposed framework fully exploits the analytical tractability of affine processes and exhibits several desirable modeling features .",
    "indeed , besides its generality , it allows for    * an automatic fit to the initially observed term structures of ois bond prices and spreads ; * a transparent characterization of order relations between spreads associated to different tenors ; * efficient valuation formulae for caplets and swaptions in a multi - curve setting .",
    "the driving affine process is allowed to take values in a general convex state space .",
    "in particular , we analyze a specification based on wishart processes and we derive a novel closed - form formula for the price of a caplet , expressed in terms of the distribution function of weighted sums of independent non - central chi - square - distributed random variables . beyond that",
    ", we test the empirical performance of two simple specifications of our setup and show that they achieve a satisfactory fit to market data .    referring to the introductory section of @xcite and to the monographies @xcite for a more detailed overview of the relevant literature ,",
    "we mention here that affine processes have been used to model multiple yield curves in @xcite by adopting a short rate approach and , more recently , in @xcite by extending the affine libor model originally introduced in @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the flexibility of our approach is highlighted by the fact that , to the best of our knowledge , all existing affine multi - curve models can be recovered as special cases of our framework .",
    "for this reason , the present work structurally differs from papers on specific affine modeling approaches , as previously considered in the literature . beyond that",
    ", it also provides a broad class of tractable specifications of the abstract hjm approach based on general it semimartingales proposed in @xcite for arbitrage - free modeling of the term structures of ois bonds and multiplicative spreads .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : intro2 ] starts by introducing the main market rates and multiplicative spreads and then presents an abstract approach to the arbitrage - free modeling of a general multi - curve interest rate market . in section  [ affinespecification ] , we develop a general framework driven by affine processes as well as possible specifications based on a short rate approach .",
    "moreover , we relate our setup to several affine multi - curve models recently proposed in the literature . in section  [ sec : aff_pricing ] , we derive general semi - closed valuation formulae for caplets and an approximate formula for the price of a swaption .",
    "section  [ sec : wishart ] contains a detailed analysis of a tractable specification based on wishart processes , deriving an analytical pricing formula for caplets .",
    "section  [ sec : aff_examples ] presents the calibration results for two specifications of the framework .",
    "finally , appendix  [ sec : gen_pricing ] presents general pricing formulae in terms of the quantities used in our framework and appendix  [ app : proof_prop ] contains the proof of proposition  [ prop : bonds_spreads ] .",
    "the underlying quantities of most interest rate products are represented by xibor rates .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the xibor rate prevailing at date @xmath1 for the time interval @xmath2 $ ] , where the tenor @xmath3 is typically one day ( 1d ) , one week ( 1w ) , or several months ( 1 m , 2 m , 3 m , 6 m or 12 m ) . referring to (",
    "* chapter 1 ) for a more detailed presentation of post - crisis interest rate markets , we just mention that xibor rates are reference rates determined by a panel of primary financial institutions for unsecured lending and are not based on actual transactions . in the post - crisis fixed income market , xibor rates associated to different tenors started to exhibit distinct behaviors , leading for instance to non - negligible basis spreads ( see appendix a.1 ) . in this paper",
    ", we shall consider xibor rates for a generic set of tenors @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , for some @xmath6 .",
    "the reference rates for overnight borrowing ( i.e. , for the shortest tenor of 1d ) correspond to the eonia ( euro overnight index average ) rate in the eurozone and to the federal funds rate in the us market . unlike xibor rates , the eonia and the federal funds rates are determined on the basis of actual overnight transactions in the interbank market by a panel of banks ( in the case of the eonia rate , this is the same panel determining the euribor rate ) .",
    "overnight rates represent the underlying of overnight indexed swaps ( ois ) , whose market swap rates are referred to as ois rates ( see appendix  [ sec : noopt ] ) , typically considered as the best proxy for risk - free rates in market practice . by bootstrapping techniques ( see  @xcite ) , ois rates allow to recover the ois term structure @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the price at date @xmath1 of an ois zero - coupon bond with maturity @xmath9 .",
    "we define the simply compounded ( risk - free ) ois spot rate by @xmath10 for @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , note that the right - hand side of the above formula corresponds to the pre - crisis textbook definition of xibor rate .",
    "our main modeling quantities are the following _ spot multiplicative spreads _ : @xmath11 corresponding to multiplicative spreads between ( normalized ) xibor rates and ( normalized ) simply compounded ois spot rates .",
    "the multiplicative spreads @xmath12 can be directly inferred from the quoted xibor and ois rates .",
    "indeed , the numerator of is determined by the xibor rate quoted on the market , while the quantity appearing in the denominator can be bootstrapped from quoted ois rates , as mentioned above . in the post - crisis environment , the quantities @xmath12",
    "are usually greater than one and increasing with respect to the tenor s length @xmath13 . neglecting liquidity issues ,",
    "this is related to the fact that xibor rates embed the risk that the average credit quality of the banks included in the xibor panel deteriorates over the term of the loan , while ois rates reflect the average credit quality of a newly refreshed xibor panel ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "as will be shown below , a key feature of our modeling framework is the facility of generating multiplicative spreads satisfying such requirements .    in comparison to additive spreads ( as considered for instance in @xcite ) , multiplicative spreads admit a natural economic interpretation in a multiple curve setting and , as shown in the following sections , represent a convenient modeling quantity in relation with affine processes . referring to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix b ) for full details , xibor rates can be associated with artificial risky bond prices @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 , for @xmath16",
    ". if risky bonds are interpreted as bonds of a foreign economy , with @xmath14 representing the price ( in units of the foreign currency ) of a foreign zero - coupon bond , and ois bonds are interpreted as domestic bonds , then the quantity @xmath12 corresponds to the _ forward exchange premium _ between the domestic and the foreign economy over the period @xmath17 $ ] . in this sense",
    ", the multiplicative spread @xmath12 can be regarded as a market expectation ( at date @xmath1 ) of the riskiness of the xibor panel over the period @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "related foreign exchange analogies have been proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let us now make precise the financial market considered in this paper . among all financial contracts written on xibor rates , forward rate agreements ( fra )",
    "can be rightfully considered as the basic building blocks , due to the simplicity of their payoff and to the fact that all linear interest rate derivatives ( such as interest rate swaps and basis swaps ) can be represented as portfolios of fras . as usually done in the literature ,",
    "we consider standard `` textbook '' fras , in contrast to the cash - settled fras traded in the market ( compare with  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 1.3 ) ) . while the payoff of market fras is non - linear , the discrepancy between the two versions of fras is typically negligible for practical purposes , as documented in  @xcite .    motivated by the above observation",
    ", we shall consider a general financial market consisting of the following families of _ basic traded assets _ , with @xmath18 denoting a fixed time horizon :    * ois zero - coupon bonds for all maturities @xmath19 $ ] ; * fra contracts for all maturities @xmath19 $ ] and for all tenors @xmath4 .",
    "note that , differently from the pre - crisis single - curve setting , fra contracts have to be considered on top of ois bonds since they can not be perfectly replicated by the latter any longer , due to the discrepancy between xibor rates @xmath20 and simply compounded ois rates @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , ois bonds play a particularly important role in collateralized transactions . indeed , the collateral rate adopted in collateralized transactions in interest rate markets is typically specified as the ois short rate and , hence , ois bonds represent the natural discount factors for the valuation of interest rate products ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) ) .",

    "we say that a fra contract written at @xmath1 is _ fair _ if its rate @xmath27 is set equal to @xmath26 , i.e. , if the price of the fra contract at the inception date @xmath1 is zero . extending definition of the spot multiplicative spread , we define ( forward ) _ multiplicative spreads _",

    "* appendix b ) for the interpretation of the forward multiplicative spread @xmath29 in terms of the foreign exchange analogy introduced at the end of section [ sec : rates ] .",
    "a first and fundamental issue is the absence of arbitrage in the financial market composed by the basic traded assets introduced above . to this end",

    "definition  [ def : couple ] is in the spirit of  @xcite , where the authors consider term structure models generated by a numraire - martingale measure couple in the above sense .",
    "note that we do not assume that @xmath37 is a traded asset and it can therefore be interpreted as a state - price density process when @xmath39 corresponds to the physical probability measure ( compare with  @xcite ) .    in the present paper , we shall work under the following standing assumption .",
    "[ ass : couple ] there exists a numraire - martingale measure couple @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , assumption [ ass : couple ] suffices to exclude the existence of arbitrage profits , in the sense of _ no asymptotic free lunch with vanishing risk _",

    "while this choice of @xmath36 will be considered in detail in section [ sec : short_rate ] , we want to point out that our framework is not limited to this specification and allows to consider several alternative settings , depending on the choice of the numraire - martingale measure couple ( see section [ sec : aff_model ] below ) . for the moment",
    ", we just think of the couple @xmath36 in abstract and general terms .",
    "assumption [ ass : couple ] implies that the arbitrage - free price of every basic traded asset can be computed by taking the conditional @xmath33-expectation of its @xmath37-discounted payoff , similarly as in the classical risk - neutral valuation paradigm is the ois bank account and @xmath33 the corresponding martingale measure , as considered in remark [ rem : ois_num ] , computing the price of a derivative by taking the conditional @xmath33-expectation of its @xmath37-discounted payoff corresponds to computing its _ clean price _ ,",
