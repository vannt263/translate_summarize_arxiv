    "relativistic heavy ion collision experiments at the bnl - ags ( au(10.7  agev)+au ) and at the cern - sps ( pb(160  agev)+pb ) have yielded a large variety of fascinating data .",
    "various observables like the strong @xmath2 suppression , enhanced yield of intermediate mass dilepton pairs , enhanced ( anti-)hyperon yields , the creation of antimatter clusters and strong transverse flow seem to indicate the formation of very dense and highly excited matter @xcite . since these observables are connected in a non - trivial way it is a tempting task for theoreticians to model high energy heavy ion collisions in a consistent way and simultaneously predict this wide range of observables from a few hundred mev up to several thousand gev per nucleon at lhc .",
    "bear in mind , however , that up to now there is no unique theoretical description of the underlying hadron@xmath3hadron interactions , with their vastly different characteristics at different incident energies and in different kinematic intervals .",
    "perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) can be applied to describe hard processes , i.e. processes with large four - momentum , @xmath4 , transfer .",
    "but pqcd is formally inappropriate for the description of the soft interactions because of the absence of the large @xmath5scale .",
    "therefore , low@xmath6 collisions are described in terms of phenomenological models .",
    "early on , multiple production of secondaries in relativistic hadronic collisions has been described within the hydrodynamic approach @xcite . then regge theory @xcite and",
    "multiperipheral models have been developed to understand the phenomenology of the soft interactions .",
    "they avoid the difficulties attributed to the statistical models .",
    "an inconvenient point of this approach is the large number of free parameters , which have to be fixed by comparison to experiment .",
    "subsequently , various qcd - motivated quark@xmath3parton models have been introduced .",
    "consequently , a vast variety of models for hadronic- and nuclear collisions have been developed .",
    "they may be subdivided into macroscopic ( statistical and hydrodynamical ) models @xcite and microscopic ( string- , transport- , cascade- , etc . )",
    "models like , e.g. urqmd @xcite , which is applied in the present paper , fritiof @xcite , venus@xcite , qgsm @xcite , rqmd @xcite and others @xcite including the parton cascade approach @xcite . in the hydrodynamical ( thermal ) model",
    "one assumes local ( global ) equilibrium - the dynamics is characterized by the equation of state employed .",
    "the microscopic models describe subsequent individual hadron@xmath3hadron collisions .    for low and intermediate energies",
    "hadron@xmath3hadron and nucleus@xmath3nucleus collisions are described in terms of the interactions between hadrons and their excited states , resonances , i.e. on the ( quasi-)particle level . at high energies the quark and gluon degrees of freedom can not be neglected .",
    "then the concept of color string excitations is introduced with their subsequent fragmentation into hadrons . in lead@xmath3on@xmath3lead collisions at the full",
    "sps energy one finds in the urqmd model that the ten most frequent hadron@xmath3hadron collision types namely , @xmath7 ( in decreasing order of frequency ) describe only 50% of the total h - h collisions .",
    "the inclusion of an additional 120 h - h collision types allows modeling up to 90% of the collisions predicted in the urqmd model , while several thousand different h - h combinations are needed to cover more than 99% of the total number of h - h collisions .",
    "since only a few of these cross sections are measured , one relies heavily on extrapolations ( and transformation , e.g. via the detailed balance principle ) of known processes .",
    "therefore , here we want to present and analyze the detailed elementary h - h input used in the transport model urqmd .",
    "the h - h predictions are a necessary basis for our understanding of the dynamics of the complex heavy ion reactions .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : a brief description of the basic principles of the urqmd model is given in sec .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] presents urqmd - results of the different h - h cross - sections for different reactions and a comparison with the available experimental data .",
    "the additive quark model ( aqm ) is used to calculate unknown cross - sections .",
    "urqmd is the first microscopic model which attempts to include the color coherent phenomena .",
    "the implications of the effects of color opacity and color transparency in the model are discussed .",
    "the treatment of the formation and decay of resonances and strings is described in detail in sec .",
    "the importance of finite size effects in the fragmentation of strings is demonstrated .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] discusses the generation of the transverse momentum of particles in the model . in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] several predictions of observables for elementary channels are presented , which are especially interesting for the upcoming proton - proton run of the na49 collaboration .",
    "finally , a summary and conclusions are given .",
    "the urqmd - model @xcite is a microscopic transport theory based on the covariant propagation of all hadrons on classical trajectories in combination with stochastic binary scatterings , color string formation and resonance decay .",
    "it represents a monte carlo solution of a large set of coupled partial integro - differential equations for the time evolution of the various phase space densities @xmath8 of particle species @xmath9 etc . , which non - relativistically assumes the boltzmann form : + + = st f_i(x , p ) , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the position and momentum of the particle , respectively , and @xmath12 denotes the collision ( or rather source- ) term of these particle species , which are connected to any other particle species @xmath13 .    the exchange of electric and baryonic charge , strangeness and four momentum in the @xmath14-channel is considered for baryon - baryon ( bb ) collisions at low energies , while meson - baryon ( mb ) and meson - meson ( mm ) interactions are treated via the formation and decay of resonances , i.e. the @xmath15-channel reactions .",
    "@xmath14-channel reactions for mb and mm collisions are taken into account from @xmath16  gev on increasing to the only mb , mm interaction type above @xmath17  gev . for nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    "the soft binary and ternary interactions between nucleons can be described by the real part of the in - medium g - matrix , which is approximated by a non - relativistic density - dependent skyrme potential of the form v^sk = t_1 _ i j ( x_i - x_j ) + t_2 _ i j k ( x_i - x_j ) ( x_j - x_k ) , where @xmath18 denotes the coordinate variable in the quantum phase space . the first term simulates the attractive potential of the nn - interaction , and the second one yields the saturation .",
    "in addition , yukawa and coulomb potentials are implemented in the model .",
    "the potentials allow to calculate the equation of state of the interacting many body system , as long as it is dominated by nucleons .",
    "note that these potential interactions are only used in the model for baryons / nucleons with relative momenta @xmath19 of less than 2@xmath20gev/@xmath21 .",
    "for the hadronic collisions discussed here , the potential interactions are omitted .",
    "further details of the application of the urqmd model to heavy - ion reactions may be found in @xcite .",
    "this framework allows to bridge with one concise model the entire available range of energies from the sis energy region ( @xmath22gev ) to the rhic energy ( @xmath23gev ) . at the highest energies",
    ", a huge number of different particle species can be produced .",
    "the model should allow for subsequent rescatterings .",
    "the collision term in the urqmd model includes more than fifty baryon species and five meson nonetts ( 45 mesons ) .",
    "the baryons and baryon resonances included in the urqmd are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",

    "extremely heavy meson resonances ( @xmath28  gev ) are not explicitly implemented , however they may be important when investigating , e.g. the dynamics of @xmath29 correlations in future experiments .    all particles can be produced in hadron - hadron collisions and can interact further with each other .",
    "the different decay channels all nucleon- , @xmath30- and hyperon - resonances up to 2.25@xmath20gev/@xmath31 mass as well as the meson ( e.g. k@xmath32 ) decays etc . are implemented . at higher energies",
    "we take advantage of the hadron universality and use a string model for the decay of intermediate states .",
    "the cross - sections of various hadronic processes as well as the formation and fragmentation of the strings are discussed in the subsequent chapters .",
    "a basic input into the microscopic transport models are the particle species and -energy dependent cross - sections of hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "the total cross - sections are interpreted geometrically .",
    "a collision between two hadrons will occur if @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the impact parameter of the hadrons and the total cross - section of the two hadrons , respectively . in the urqmd model the total cross - section @xmath35 depends on the isospins of colliding particles , their flavor and the c.m .",
    "however , partial cross - sections are then used to calculate the relative weights for the different channels .",
    "only a small fraction of all possible hadronic cross - sections has been measured . in the following sections , we compare the urqmd cross - sections with experimental data .",
    "if no data are available , the additive quark model and detailed balance arguments are used to extrapolate such unknown observables .      the total bb cross - section of the reaction @xmath36 has the general form _ tot^bb ( ) ( 2s_d + 1 ) ( 2s_e + 1 ) |m|^2 , with the spins of the particles , @xmath37 , momenta of the pairs of particles , @xmath38 , in the two - particle rest frame , and the matrix element @xmath39 . the matrix element @xmath39",

    "energy .",
    "if high quality experimental data on the respective cross section exists , a phenomenological fit to the respective data is by far the most accurate approach for implementing the cross section .",
    "otherwise , we have to rely on simplified assumption for the matrix element and employ general symmetries , like the principle of detailed balance ( see section  [ res_sec ] ) .",
    "let us start by investigating the total cross - section of proton - proton collisions from a beam momentum of 0.1@xmath20gev/@xmath21 up to @xmath40gev/@xmath21 as shown in fig .",

    "note that the steep rise in the data below 300@xmath20mev/@xmath21 is due to soft coulomb interaction of the protons and is taken care of via the potential interaction .",
    "the structure in the @xmath41 cross - section is mainly due to the inelastic channels which are shown in fig .",

    "here we use only the elastic channel and the @xmath14-channel excitation of both particles . the cross section at very high energies is given by the cern - hera parametrization as shown in table [ tab2 ] .      due to the fact that the experimental preparation of meson beams and targets is restricted to @xmath75 s and k s ,",

    "the picture changes drastically : the produced particles dominate the reactions , while the incoming nucleons have dropped to a 15% admixture in particle density and multiplicity @xcite .    to describe the total meson - meson reaction cross - sections , we make use of the additive quark model ( see below ) and the principle of detailed balance , which assumes the reversibility of the particle interactions .    fig .",
