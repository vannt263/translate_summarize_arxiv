    "over the past ten years , large ( supersymmetric ) extra dimensions have been subject to an increased attention , providing a simple framework for new cosmological ideas .",
    "motivated by scenarios such as the randall - sundrum model @xcite , physics in the presence of one extra dimension has been extensively analyzed and represents an interesting framework in which effects from the higher dimension can be understood .",
    "nevertheless , just as the dynamics of domain walls in a four - dimensional spacetime is in many ways very different to that of a cosmic string or point particle , the behavior of gravity near codimension - one branes is not representative of that around higher codimensional objects .",
    "models with two large extra dimensions , on the other hand , are capable of tracking some of the more interesting features of higher codimension objects , without introducing complications associated with higher - codimension branes .",
    "six - dimensional ( super)gravity is therefore a choice framework for the study of higher - dimensional effects , and presents remarkable features of its own .",
    "solutions of six - dimensional gravity , have been found in refs .",
    "@xcite , cosmological solutions in @xcite , and the stability of these models has been studied in @xcite . in six - dimensional supergravity , for instance , not only would the hierarchy problem be resolved if these dimensions had a submillimeter size @xcite , but if supersymmetry remained unbroken in the bulk at energies much lower that on the brane , the casimir energy could also be of the same order of magnitude as the observed four - dimensional cosmological constant , @xcite .",
    "another property of codimension - two objects relevant to the cosmological constant problem is their capacity of preserving a flat minkowski induced geometry in the presence of any tension , @xcite .",
    "codimension - two branes in the context of six - dimensional ( super)gravity can therefore provide potential resolutions of two of the most embarrassing problems of current particle physics and cosmology , namely the hierarchy and cosmological constant problems in scenarios where the weinberg s argument has different imports , @xcite . nevertheless , these models are faced with one great obstacle , the necessity of regularizing the brane before any question can be addressed , @xcite .",
    "distributional sources of matter on codimension - two and higher branes are indeed only well - defined as regularized objects , and one can therefore wonder whether any regularization - independent statement can even be made . from a field theory perspective , one expects the low - energy theory on such a brane to be independent of any high - energy regularization scheme , yet as of today , no regularization - invariant scheme has been proposed to study the effective theory on such branes .",
    "the only known work in this direction has been developed by goldberger and wise in 2001 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where it is pointed out that a field living on a six - dimensional flat spacetime will typically present a pathological behavior if coupling terms were to be introduced on a codimension - two surface .",
    "this pathology can however be removed by appropriate renormalization of the coupling constants . in this paper",
    ", we propose a direct extension to ref .",
    "@xcite , where we analyze couplings between bulk fields , free to live in the entire six dimensions , and brane fields , which are confined to codimension - two branes .",
    "the couplings between the two fields induce pathologies for both fields which can be absorbed by appropriate renormalization .",
    "similar ideas have been proposed as being useful for understanding black hole physics @xcite , post - newtonian corrections @xcite and brane localized kinetic terms @xcite .    in what follows , we first review in section [ sectionii ] the problems arising when dealing with distributional sources on codimension - two branes , the regularization schemes that have been proposed in the literature as well as different sources of confusion which we clarify .",
    "we then explain the philosophy of our approach and discuss the main consequences .",
    "our strategy is applied in section [ section free theory ] , where a scalar field toy - model is considered . in particular",
    ", we analyze couplings between a bulk and a brane scalar field and discuss the renormalization procedure using two different techniques .",
    "the first one makes use of a conical cap to regularize the brane , while the other removes the divergences directly in the propagators .",
    "both methods give rise to the same renormalization group ( rg ) flows .",
    "this analysis is then extended to all possible relevant and marginal couplings in section [ sectioninteractions ] , where the three and four - point functions are computed as well as the loop diagrams . using these couplings",
    ", we also demonstrate that the theory is renormalizable . the second part of this paper is then dedicated to the physical implications . in section [ section em ] ,",
    "we show how the same prescription remains valid when considering the more physical example of interactions between gravity and electromagnetism and finally explores the implications for localized kinetic terms on the brane which are relevant for models such as the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) in section [ section kinetic terms ] .",
    "we show how to make sense of kinetic couplings on the brane and deduce that only fixed functions of the kinetic terms are allowed by the renormalization procedure . after concluding in section [ section conclusion ]",
    ", we consider all possible local counterterms in appendix [ appendix ct ] and argue that no such counterterms can simultaneously absorb the bulk field divergences both in the bulk and on the brane , in complete agreement with our procedure .",
    "using the rg flows obtained for the brane couplings , we finish in appendix  [ appendix generalcase ] by computing the arbitrary @xmath0-point function at all order in loops , and prove that it remains finite in the thin - brane limit , hence justifying that the theory is renormalizable against codimension - two divergences .",
    "in 1987 , geroch & traschen showed that strings and point particles do not belong to the class of metrics whose curvatures are well defined as distributions , @xcite . in their analysis , they considered a string in @xmath1-dimensions to be regularized as a cylinder of radius @xmath2 carrying energy density @xmath3 .",
    "the profile of the gravitational potential @xmath4 is obtained by solving poisson s equation @xmath5 , where @xmath3 vanishes outside the cylinder .",
    "although well - defined when the cylinder has a finite width @xmath2 , it turns out that the gravitational potential @xmath4 is not locally integrable in the thin - brane limit @xmath6 and so strings ( and point particles ) are not permitted as sources in @xmath1-dimensions , unless they are pure tension strings .",
    "issues arising from smoothing out codimension - two branes are also discussed in @xcite .    despite the amount of attention branes",
    "have recently received , mainly motivated by string theory , the situation is unfortunately no different for those objects whose intrinsic codimension is equal or greater to two . from the string theory point of view ,",
    "progress in these areas has mainly been achieved by neglecting the backreaction of such objects , treating them as test particles , the so - called probe - brane approximation . from a cosmological point view",
    ", however , such a procedure would miss some of their most important features and is hence not always satisfying . instead",
    ", much effort has been invested in specific regularizations of the theory , such as models arising from abelian - higgs theory , @xcite , thick brane regularizations , @xcite , capped branes , @xcite , intersecting branes , @xcite , codimension - two branes confined on codimension - one objects @xcite , etc ...    in all of these examples , if the extra dimensions are compact or if an einstein - hilbert term is confined on the brane , one recovers four - dimensional gravity for the zero mode .",
    "however a logarithmic divergence appears in the first kaluza - klein mode as soon as the regularization mechanism is removed ( or the thin - brane limit is taken ) . understanding the significance of this divergence and the consequences for an observer on the brane represents the main objective of this paper .",
    "bulk fields away from a defect should be insensitive to the regularization procedure , but evaluating them on the defect itself requires knowledge of the internal structure of the defect .",
    "the philosophy of this paper is therefore to accept the presence of divergences in the thin - brane limit for bulk fields when evaluated on a codimension - two defect but to ensure that these divergences do not propagate into matter fields confined on the defect .",
    "we will show the validity of an effective field theory for such fields and present how observables on the brane remain finite after appropriate renormalization of the coupling constants .      following the analysis of goldberger and wise @xcite , the brane - to - brane feynman propagator for a massless scalar field living in six - dimensional flat space - time with a conical singularity of deficit angle @xmath7 at @xmath8",
    "is given by [ b - b prop ] d_k(0 ; 0)=-_0^ = - , where @xmath9 is the four - dimensional momentum along the brane direction , ( see eq .   for more details . )",
    "the brane - brane propagator is therefore divergent in the thin - brane limit for which the cutoff @xmath10 is sent to infinity ( or for large physical scale . ) in real space , on the other hand , the free propagator is finite outside the coincidence limit , and the presence of the logarithmic divergence in four - dimensional momentum space is merely a consequence to the fact that the gravitational potential of six - dimensional gravity behaves as @xmath11 in real space .",
    "more precisely , one can express the free brane - to - brane bulk propagator in real space as d(0,x;0,x)&= & _ 0^ + & = & _ 0^ = , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent directions tangent to the codimension - two brane and the two - point function is evaluated at @xmath8 along the normal direction . when the integral over the brane momentum @xmath9 is performed before that over the bulk momentum @xmath14",
    ", the two - point function is finite everywhere .",
    "nevertheless , as soon as a source is considered at @xmath8 , the logarithmic behavior of the brane - brane two - point function in momentum space becomes relevant .",
    "this will be seen more concretely in what follows .",
    "we present here two general sources of confusion that usually appear when discovering these logarithmic divergences :    * the first one is related to the nature of the divergence , and the order of magnitude at which it arises . any codimension - two object arises from an underlying theory ( abelian - higgs field theory , string theory or any other underlying theory ) which will naturally provide a regularization mechanism for the brane",
    ". we could hence argue that the notion of thin - brane limit is not physical and one should not be concerned about any thin - brane divergences .",
    "yet , such a argument would be going against the principles of effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "even though the brane is expected to be regularized at some scale ( the string scale ) , we expect from eft that the low - energy physics is independent of the high - energy regularization mechanism .",
    "in other words , one should not need to understand the physics at string scale in order to understand and make predictions about the low - energy physics . *",
    "faced with this realization , one can hope that introducing brane localized counterterms should remove the logarithmic divergence present in without effecting the bulk propagator .",
    "unfortunately such an approach is too naive in this context , since brane - localized counterterms will not only affect the brane - brane propagator @xmath15 but also the brane - bulk @xmath16 and bulk - bulk propagators @xmath17 which were previously finite .",
    "any attempt to absorb the logarithmic divergence of the brane - brane propagator into brane localized counterterms will then automatically result in the introduction of further divergences .",
    "this argument is made more explicit in appendix [ appendix ct ] , where we consider the most general set of local counterterms ( that remain quadratic in the scalar field ) both in the bulk and on the brane , and show explicitly that no such counterterms will allow the propagator to be finite everywhere .",
    "in the philosophy we will follow , we will thus not attempt to make the bulk field propagator finite everywhere but will rather explore the consequences for observers on the brane .      in a conical space - time , the propagator diverges at the tip of the cone .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the consequences for a scalar field living on the tip and coupled to a bulk field .",
    "we expect physically that    1 .",
    "bulk fields evaluated away from the brane should not depend on the regularization mechanism and thus be finite in the thin - brane limit .",
    "bulk fields evaluated on the brane itself are sensitive to the regularization procedure , since the position at which they are evaluated , the position of the brane , is dependent of the regularization .",
    "therefore we do not require bulk fields evaluated on the brane ( at @xmath8 ) to be finite in the thin - brane limit .",
    "brane fields , should have a well defined low - energy theory independent of the brane regularization . as long as the energy scales probed by an observer on the brane are much lower than that of the cutoff theory ,",
    "the physics we will observe should be independent of the regularization , and hence finite in the thin - brane limit .    in this paper",
    ", we will follow this philosophy carefully .",
    "the case of bulk fields with brane couplings was considered in @xcite .",
    "we here extend this analysis to matter fields confined to the brane and draw conclusions for brane observers .",
    "in this section we compute the propagator for scalar fields confined to a codimension - two brane and coupled with a bulk scalar field .",
    "we work in a six - dimensional flat space - time with a conical singularity located at @xmath8 : s^2=x^x^+r^2 + r^2 ^2 , with @xmath18 , and where @xmath19 is the deficit angle ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "a three - dimensional brane is located at the tip of the cone and @xmath21 represents the coordinates along the brane direction .",
    "we use the notation @xmath22 ; @xmath23 ; + @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "this scalar field toy - model represents a good framework for the study of effective theories on codimension - two branes .",
    "the theory is composed of two coupled scalar fields , namely    * the scalar field @xmath26 which symbolizes the bulk fields ( gravity , dilaton , gauge field ... ) and thus lives in six dimensions , * the brane field @xmath27 which symbolizes the matter fields living on the brane ( standard model ) and thus confined to a four - dimensional space - time .",
    "the action for this system can thus be taken to be of the form [ freeaction ] s=-^6 x @xmath28 $ ] , where for simplicity we have assumed the field @xmath26 to be massless in the bulk , but further extensions will be considered in section [ sectioninteractions ] .",
    "the coupling between the bulk and brane fields is symbolized by the term @xmath29 ( which can be set to zero ) .",
    "higher interactions will be considered in section [ sectioninteractions ] .    to make contact with previous works in the literature",
    ", we first consider a specific thick - brane regularization mechanism , and show how the coupling constants can be renormalized in order for the theory to remain finite in the thin - brane limit .",
    "we then explore the renormalization mechanism in a more systematic way by analyzing the different classical two - point functions before turning to interactions and one - loop corrections in the following section .",
    "we point out that both methods will give rise to the same tree - level renomalized couplings .      as a warm up",
    ", we follow a standard technique used in the literature to confine matter fields on a codimension - two brane , namely a thick - brane regularization in which the brane is no longer located at @xmath8 , but rather at @xmath30 .",

    "the action is regularized by [ regaction ] s=-^4 xr r & ( & 12 ( _ r ) ^2 + 12 ( _ ) ^2 + & & + ) , where for simplicity we omit for now any angular dependance .",
    "this leads to the following equations of motions : & & -_r(r (r))+k^2 = -@xmath32(r- ) + & & ( r- ) , [ bdycond ] @xmath33 being the eigenvalue of the four - dimensional dalembertian @xmath34 .",

    "one can solve for the bulk scalar field separately in the conical cap ( for @xmath36 ) and within the bulk ( @xmath37 ) .",

    "for the bulk scalar field to be well - defined in the thin - brane limit , we require @xmath46 to remain finite when probing large physical scales @xmath49 .",
    "this will only be possible if the logarithmic divergence is reabsorbed into one of the coupling constants @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",

    "the point of the renormalization is to make sense of the bulk field away from the tip , however at the tip itself the bulk field diverges logarithmically as explained in section [ sectionii ] which is consistent with our philosophy .",
