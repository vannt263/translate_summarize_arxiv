    "the objective of this investigation is to study three - dimensional ( 3d ) flows of viscous incompressible fluids which are constructed to exhibit extreme growth of enstrophy .",
    "it is motivated by the question whether the solutions to the 3d incompressible navier - stokes system on unbounded or periodic domains corresponding to smooth initial data may develop a singularity in finite time @xcite . by formation of a `` singularity '' we mean",
    "the situation when some norms of the solution corresponding to smooth initial data have become unbounded after a finite time .",
    "this so - called `` blow - up problem '' is one of the key open questions in mathematical fluid mechanics and , in fact , its importance for mathematics in general has been recognized by the clay mathematics institute as one of its `` millennium problems '' @xcite .",
    "questions concerning global - in - time existence of smooth solutions remain open also for a number of other flow models including the 3d euler equations @xcite and some of the `` active scalar '' equations @xcite .    while the blow - up problem is fundamentally a question in mathematical analysis , a lot of computational studies",
    "have been carried out since the mid-90s in order to shed light on the hydrodynamic mechanisms which might lead to singularity formation in finite time .",
    "given that such flows evolving near the edge of regularity involve formation of very small flow structures , these computations typically require the use of state - of - the - art computational resources available at a given time .",
    "the computational studies focused on the possibility of finite - time blow - up in the 3d navier - stokes and/or euler system include @xcite , all of which considered problems defined on domains periodic in all three dimensions .",
    "recent investigations by @xcite focused on the time evolution of vorticity moments and compared it with the predictions derived from analysis based on rigorous bounds .",
    "we also mention the studies by @xcite and @xcite , along with the references found therein , in which various complexified forms of the euler equation were investigated .",
    "the idea of this approach is that , since the solutions to complexified equations have singularities in the complex plane , singularity formation in the real - valued problem is manifested by the collapse of the complex - plane singularities onto the real axis .",
    "overall , the outcome of these investigations is rather inconclusive : while for the navier - stokes flows most of recent computations do not offer support for finite - time blow - up , the evidence appears split in the case of the euler system . in particular , the recent studies by @xcite and @xcite hinted at the possibility of singularity formation in finite time . in this connection we also mention the recent investigations by @xcite in which blow - up was observed in axisymmetric euler flows in a bounded ( tubular ) domain .",
    "a common feature of all of the aforementioned investigations was that the initial data for the navier - stokes or euler system was chosen in an ad - hoc manner , based on some heuristic arguments .",
    "on the other hand , in the present study we pursue a fundamentally different approach , proposed originally by @xcite and employed also by @xcite for a range of related problems , in which the initial data leading to the most singular behaviour is sought systematically via solution of a suitable variational optimization problem .",
    "we carefully analyze the time evolution induced by the extreme vortex states first identified by @xcite and compare it to the time evolution corresponding to a number of other candidate initial conditions considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the taylor - green vortex , studied in the context of the blow - up problem by @xcite , is in fact a particular member of the family of extreme vortex states maximizing the instantaneous rate of enstrophy production in the limit of vanishing enstrophy .",
    "in addition , based on these findings , we identify the set of initial data , parameterized by its energy and enstrophy , for which one can a priori guarantee global - in - time existence of smooth solutions .",
    "this result therefore offers a physically appealing interpretation of an `` abstract '' mathematical theorem concerning global existence of classical solutions corresponding to `` small '' initial data @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that , in order to establish a direct link with the results of the mathematical analysis discussed below , in our investigation we follow a rather different strategy than in most of the studies referenced above . while these earlier studies relied on data from a relatively small number of simulations performed at a high ( at the given time ) resolution , in the present investigation we explore a broad range of cases , each of which is however computed at a more moderate resolution ( or , equivalently , reynolds number ) . with such an approach to the use of available computational resources , we are able to reveal trends resulting from the variation of parameters which otherwise would be hard to detect .",
    "systematic computations conducted in this way thus allow us to probe the sharpness of the mathematical analysis relevant to the problem .",
    "the question of regularity of solution to the navier - stokes system is usually addressed using `` energy '' methods which rely on finding upper bounds ( with respect to time ) on certain quantities of interest , typically taken as suitable sobolev norms of the solution .",
    "a key intermediate step is obtaining bounds on the rate of growth of the quantity of interest , a problem which can be studied with ode methods . while for the navier - stokes system",
    "different norms of the velocity gradient or vorticity can be used to study the regularity of solutions , the use of enstrophy @xmath5 ( see equation ) is privileged by the well - known result of @xcite , where it was established that if the uniform bound @xmath6 holds , then the regularity of the solution @xmath7 is guaranteed up to time @xmath8 ( to be precise , the solution remains in a suitable gevrey class ) . from the computational point of view , the enstrophy @xmath9 is thus a convenient indicator of the regularity of solutions , because in the light of , singularity formation must manifest itself by the enstrophy becoming infinite .",
    "while characterization of the maximum possible finite - time growth of enstrophy in the 3d navier - stokes flows is the ultimate objective of this research program , analogous questions can also be posed in the context of more tractable problems involving the one - dimensional ( 1d ) burgers equation and the two - dimensional ( 2d ) navier - stokes equation .",
    "although global - in - time existence of the classical ( smooth ) solutions is well known for both these problems @xcite , questions concerning the sharpness of the corresponding estimates for the instantaneous and finite - time growth of various quantities are relevant , because these estimates are obtained using essentially the same methods as employed to derive their 3d counterparts .",
    "since in 2d flows on unbounded or periodic domains the enstrophy may not increase ( @xmath10 ) , the relevant quantity in this case is the palinstrophy @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the vorticity ( which reduces to a pseudo - scalar in 2d ) .",
    "different questions concerning sharpness of estimates addressed in our research program are summarized together with the results obtained to date in table [ tab : estimates ] .",
    "we remark that the best finite - time estimate for the 1d burgers equation was found _ not _ to be sharp using the initial data obtained from both the instantaneous and the finite - time variational optimization problems @xcite . on the other hand , in 2d the bounds on both the _ instantaneous _ and _ finite - time _ growth of palinstrophy were found to be sharp and , somewhat surprisingly , both estimates were realized by the same family of incompressible vector fields parameterized by energy @xmath13 and palinstrophy @xmath14 , obtained as the solution of an _ instantaneous _ optimization problem @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that while the estimate for the instantaneous rate of growth of palinstrophy @xmath15 ( see table [ tab : estimates ] ) was found to be sharp with respect to variations in palinstrophy , the estimate is in fact not sharp with respect to the prefactor @xmath16 @xcite , with the correct prefactor being of the form @xmath17 .",
    "we add that what distinguishes the 2d problem , in regard to both the instantaneous and finite - time bounds , is that the rhs of these bounds are expressed in terms of two quantities , namely , energy @xmath13 and enstrophy @xmath5 , in contrast to the enstrophy alone appearing in the 1d and 3d estimates . as a result ,",
    "the 2d instantaneous optimization problem had to be solved subject to _ two _ constraints .    in the present investigation we advance the research program summarized in table [ tab : estimates ] by assessing to what extent the finite - time growth of enstrophy predicted by the analytic estimates and can be actually realized by flow evolution starting from different initial conditions , including the extreme vortex states found by @xcite to saturate the instantaneous estimate .",
    "the key finding is that , at least for the range of modest enstrophy values we considered , the growth of enstrophy corresponding to this initial data , which has the form of two colliding axisymmetric vortex rings , is rapidly depleted and there is no indication of singularity formation in finite time .",
    "thus , should finite - time singularity be possible in the navier - stokes system , it is unlikely to result from initial conditions instantaneously maximizing the rate of growth of enstrophy .",
    "we also provide a comprehensive characterization of the extreme vortex states which realize estimate together with the resulting flow evolutions .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in the next section we present analytic estimates on the instantaneous and finite - time growth of enstrophy in 3d flows . in  [ sec:3d_instopt ]",
    "we formulate the variational optimization problems which will be solved to find the vortex states with the largest rate of enstrophy production and in ",
    "[ sec:3d_instopt_e0to0 ] we provide an asymptotic representation for these optimal states in the limit of vanishing enstrophy . in  [ sec:3d_instopt_e ] we present numerically computed extreme vortex states corresponding to intermediate and large enstrophy values , while in  [ sec : timeevolution ] we analyze the temporal evolution corresponding to different initial data in order to compare it with the predictions of estimates and .",
    "our findings are discussed in  [ sec : discuss ] , whereas conclusions and outlook are deferred to ",

    "the fluid density @xmath33 is assumed to be constant and equal to unity ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the relevant properties of solutions to system can be studied using energy methods , with the energy @xmath35 and its rate of growth given by @xmath36 where `` @xmath37 '' means `` equal to by definition '' .",
    "the enstrophy @xmath38 and its rate of growth are given by @xmath39 for incompressible flows with periodic boundary conditions we also have the following identity @xcite @xmath40 hence , combining  , the energy and enstrophy satisfy the system of ordinary differential equations    @xmath41    a standard approach at this point is to try to upper - bound @xmath2 and using standard techniques of functional analysis it is possible to obtain the following well - known estimate in terms of @xmath13 and @xmath5 @xcite @xmath42 for @xmath43 an absolute constant .",
    "a related estimate expressed entirely in terms of the enstrophy @xmath5 is given by @xmath44 by simply integrating the differential inequality in with respect to time we obtain the finite - time bound @xmath45 which clearly becomes infinite at time @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "thus , based on estimate , it is not possible to establish the boundedness of the enstrophy @xmath47 globally in time and hence the regularity of solutions .",
    "therefore , the question about the finite - time singularity formation can be recast in terms of whether or not estimate can be saturated . by this",
    "we mean the existence of initial data with enstrophy @xmath48 such that the resulting time evolution realizes the largest growth of enstrophy @xmath47 allowed by the right - hand side ( rhs ) of estimate .",
    "a systematic search for such most singular initial data using variational optimization methods is the key theme of this study .",
    "although different notions of sharpness of an estimate can be defined , e.g. , sharpness with respect to constants or exponents in the case of estimates in the form of power laws , the precise notion of sharpness considered in this study is the following    [ def : notionsharpness ] given a parameter @xmath49 and maps @xmath50 , the estimate @xmath51 is declared sharp in the limit @xmath52 if and only if @xmath53    from this definition , the sharpness of estimates in the form @xmath54 for some @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be addressed in the limit @xmath57 by studying the adequacy of the exponent @xmath58 .    the question of sharpness of estimate was addressed in the seminal study by @xcite , see also @xcite , who constructed a family of divergence - free velocity fields saturating this estimate .",
    "more precisely , these vector fields were parameterized by their enstrophy and for sufficiently large values of @xmath5 the corresponding rate of growth @xmath1 was found to be proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , in agreement with definition [ def : notionsharpness ] , estimate was declared sharp up to a numerical prefactor .",
    "however , the sharpness of the instantaneous estimate alone does not allow us to conclude about the possibility of singularity formation , because for this situation to occur , a sufficiently large enstrophy growth rate would need to be sustained over a _ finite _ time window @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , assuming the instantaneous rate of growth of enstrophy in the form @xmath61 for some @xmath62 , any exponent @xmath63 will produce blow - up of @xmath47 in finite time if the rate of growth is sustained .",
    "the fact that there is no blow - up for @xmath64 follows from grnwall s lemma and the fact that one factor of @xmath5 in can be bounded in terms of the initial energy using as follows @xmath65 \\leq \\frac{1}{2\\nu } \\k(0 ) .",

    "we note , however , that since the rhs of this inequality can not be expressed entirely in terms of properties of the initial data , this is _ not _ in fact an a priori estimate .",
    "estimate also allows us to obtain a condition on the size of the initial data , given in terms of its energy @xmath67 and enstrophy @xmath68 , which guarantees that smooth solutions will exist globally in time , namely , @xmath69 from which it follows that @xmath70 thus , flows with energy and enstrophy satisfying inequality are guaranteed to be smooth for all time , in agreement with the regularity results available under the assumption of small initial data @xcite .",
    "sharpness of instantaneous estimate , in the sense of definition [ def : notionsharpness ] , can be probed by constructing a family of `` extreme vortex states '' @xmath71 which , for each @xmath72 , have prescribed enstrophy @xmath73 and produce the largest possible rate of growth of enstrophy @xmath74 . given the form of , the fields @xmath71 can be expected to exhibit ( at least piecewise ) smooth dependence on @xmath0 and we will refer to the mapping @xmath75 as a `` maximizing branch '' .",
    "thus , information about the sharpness of estimate can be deduced by analyzing the relation @xmath0 versus @xmath74 obtained for a possibly broad range of enstrophy values .",
    "a maximizing branch is constructed by finding , for different values of @xmath0 , the extreme vortex states @xmath71 as solutions of a variational optimization problem defined below .",
    "hereafter , @xmath76 will denote the sobolev space of functions with square - integrable second derivatives endowed with the inner product @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 are parameters with the meaning of length scales ( the reasons for introducing these parameters in the definition of the inner product will become clear below ) .",
    "the inner product in the space @xmath79 is obtained from by setting @xmath80 .",
    "the notation @xmath81 will refer to the sobolev space @xmath76 of functions with zero mean . for every fixed value @xmath0 of enstrophy we will look for a divergence - free vector field @xmath71 maximizing the objective function @xmath82 defined in .",
    "we thus have the following    [ pb : maxdedt_e ] given @xmath83 and the objective functional @xmath84 from equation , find @xmath85    which will be solved for enstrophy @xmath0 spanning a broad range of values .",
    "this approach was originally proposed and investigated by @xcite . in the present study",
    "we extend and generalize these results by first showing how other fields considered in the context of the blow - up problem for both the euler and navier - stokes system , namely the taylor - green vortex , also arise from variational problem [ pb : maxdedt_e ] .",
    "we then thoroughly analyze the time evolution corresponding to our extreme vortex states and compare it with the predictions of the finite - time estimates and . as discussed at the end of this section , some important aspects of our approach to solving problem [ pb : maxdedt_e ] are also quite different from the method adopted by @xcite .",
    "the smoothness requirement in the statement of problem [ pb : maxdedt_e ] ( @xmath86 ) follows from the definition of the objective functional @xmath84 in equation , where both the viscous term @xmath87 contain derivatives of order up to two .",
    "the constraint manifold @xmath88 can be interpreted as an intersection of the manifold ( a subspace ) @xmath89 of divergence - free fields and the manifold @xmath90 of fields with prescribed enstrophy @xmath0 .",

    "it ought to be emphasized here that the approach presented above in which the projections  and gradients  are obtained based on the infinite - dimensional ( continuous ) formulation to be discretized only at the final stage is fundamentally different from the method employed in the original study by @xcite in which the optimization problem was solved in a fully discrete setting ( the two approaches are referred to as `` optimize - then - discretize '' and `` discretize - then - optimize '' , respectively , cf .",

    "we see that the maximizers @xmath71 of problem [ pb : maxdedt_e ] are the only initial data which triggers growth of enstrophy for these values of the initial enstrophy and , as expected , this growth is larger for @xmath374 than for @xmath373 .",
    "the other initial condition which exhibits some tendency for growth when @xmath374 is the taylor - green vortex . in all cases",

    "it follows from estimate that @xmath378 pointwise in time .",
    "the hypothetical extreme event of a finite - time blow - up can be represented graphically by an intersection of the graph of @xmath379 with the horizontal line @xmath380 , which is also shown in figures [ fig : fg](a)(b ) .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath377 , representing the upper bound in estimate , is quite distinct in figures [ fig : fg](a ) and [ fig :",

    "in this section we provide some comments about the results reported in   [ sec:3d_instopt_e0to0 ] , [ sec:3d_instopt_e ] and [ sec : timeevolution ] .",
    "first , we need to mention that our gradient - based approach to the solution of optimization problem [ pb : maxdedt_e ] can only yield local maximizers and , due to nonconvexity of the problem , it is not possible to guarantee a priori that the maximizers found are global . to test for the possible presence of branches other than the ones found using the continuation approach described in  [ sec:3d_instopt ] , cf .",
    "algorithm [ alg : optimalg ] , we tried to find new maximizers by initializing the gradient iterations with different initial guesses @xmath113 .",
    "they were constructed as solenoidal vector fields with prescribed regularity and random structure , which was achieved by defining the fourier coefficients of @xmath113 as @xmath389 with the amplitude @xmath390 and the phases @xmath391 chosen as random numbers uniformly distributed in @xmath392 $ ] .",
    "however , in all such tests conducted for @xmath393 the gradient optimization algorithm would always converge to maximizers @xmath71 belonging to one of the branches discussed in ",
    "[ sec:3d_instopt_e ] ( modulo possible translations in the physical domain ) . while far from settling this issue definitely , these observations lend some credence to the conjecture that the branch identified in  [ sec:3d_instopt_e ]",
    "corresponds in fact to the global maximizers .",
    "these states appear identical to the maximizers found by @xcite and our search has also yielded two additional branches of locally maximizing fields , although we did not capture the lower branch reported by @xcite . however , since that branch does not appear connected to any state in the limit @xmath117 , we speculate that it might be an artifact of the `` discretize - then - optimize '' formulation used by @xcite , in contrast to the `` optimize - then - discretize '' approach employed in our study which provides a more direct control over the analytic properties of the maximizers .",
    "we add that the structure of the maximizing branches found here is in fact quite similar to what was discovered by @xcite in an analogous problem in 2d .",
    "since the 2d problem is more tractable from the computational point of view , in that case we were able to undertake a much more thorough search for other maximizers which did not however yield any solutions not associated with the main branches .",
    "the results reported in  [ sec:3d_instopt_e ] and  [ sec : timeevolution ] clearly exhibit two distinct behaviours , depending on whether or not global - in - time regularity can be guaranteed a priori based on estimates .",
    "these differences are manifested , for example , in the power laws evident in figures [ fig : scalinglaws_fixe ] and [ fig : emax_vse0_fixe ] , as well as in the different behaviours of the rhs of estimate with respect to time in figures [ fig : fg](a ) and [ fig : fg](b ) .",
    "however , for the initial data for which global - in - time regularity can not be ensured a priori there is no evidence of sustained growth of enstrophy strong enough to signal formation of singularity in finite time .",
    "indeed , in figure [ fig : emax_vse0_fixe](c ) one sees that the quantity @xmath394 behaves as @xmath395 , where @xmath396 , when @xmath0 increases , revealing no tendency to approach @xmath381 which is a necessary precursor of a singular behaviour ( cf .",
    "discussion in ",
    "[ sec : timeevolution ] ) . to further illustrate how the rate of growth of enstrophy achieved initially by the maximizers @xmath71",
    "is depleted in time , in figure [ fig : dedte ] we show the flow evolution corresponding to @xmath71 with @xmath374 as a trajectory in the coordinates @xmath397 . from the discussion in introduction we know that in order for the singularity to occur in finite time , the enstrophy must grow at least at a sustained rate @xmath398 for some @xmath63 .",
    "in other words , a `` blow - up trajectory '' will be realized only if the trajectory of the flow , expressed in @xmath399 coordinates , is contained in the region @xmath400 , for some positive constants @xmath401 and @xmath402 .",
    "for the flow corresponding to the instantaneous optimizers @xmath71 , the initial direction of a trajectory in @xmath399 coordinates is determined by the vector @xmath403 $ ] and , for initial conditions @xmath359 satisfying @xmath404 , it follows that @xmath405 since the optimal rate of growth is sustained only over a short interval of time , the trajectory of the flow in the @xmath406 coordinates approaches the region @xmath407 only tangentially following the direction of the lower bound @xmath408 , and remains outside @xmath407 for all subsequent times .",
    "this behaviour is clearly seen in the inset of figure [ fig : dedte ] .",
    "an interpretation of this behaviour can be proposed based on equation from which it is clear that the evolution of the flow energy is closely related to the growth of enstrophy . in particular ,",
    "if the initial energy @xmath67 is not sufficiently large , then its depletion due to the initial growth of enstrophy may render the flow incapable of sustaining this growth over a longer period of time .",
    "this is in fact what seems to be happening in the present problem as evidenced by the data shown in figure [ fig : k0e0 ] .",
    "we remark that , for a prescribed enstrophy @xmath68 , the flow energy can not be increased arbitrarily as it is upper - bounded by poincar s inequality @xmath409 .",
    "this behaviour can also be understood in terms of the geometry of the extreme vortex states @xmath71 .",
    "figure [ fig : ring ] shows a magnification of the pair of vortex rings corresponding to the optimal field @xmath71 with @xmath410 .",
    "it is observed that the vorticity field @xmath411 inside the vortex core has an azimuthal component only which exhibits no variation in the azimuthal direction .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath412 the vortex ring shrinks with respect to the domain @xmath182 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : scalinglaws_fixe](d ) ) and the field @xmath71 ultimately becomes axisymmetric ( i.e. , in this limit boundary effects vanish ) . at the same time , it is known that the 3d navier - stokes problem on an unbounded domain and with axisymmetric initial data is globally well posed @xcite , a results which is a consequence of the celebrated theorem due to @xcite .",
    "with @xmath374 in the coordinates @xmath406 . for comparison , in the inset",
    "the thin line represents the borderline growth at the rate @xmath413,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    .",
    "[ fig : dedte ]     with @xmath374 .",
    "the colour coding of the vortex lines is for identification purposes only.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we close this section by comparing the different power laws characterizing the maximizers @xmath71 and the corresponding flow evolutions with the results obtained in analogous studies of extreme behaviour in 1d and 2d ( see also table [ tab : estimates ] ) .",
    "first , we note that the finite - time growth of enstrophy @xmath414 in 3d , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : emax_vse0_fixe](a ) , exhibits the same dependence on the enstrophy @xmath0 of the instantaneously optimal initial data as in 1d , i.e. , is directly proportional to @xmath0 in both cases @xcite .",
    "this is also analogous to the maximum growth of palinstrophy @xmath14 in 2d which was found by @xcite to scale with the palinstrophy @xmath415 of the initial data , when the instantaneously optimal initial condition was computed subject to _ one _ constraint only ( on @xmath415 ) .",
    "when the instantaneously optimal initial data was determined subject to _ two _ constraints , on @xmath365 and @xmath415 , then the maximum finite - time growth of palinstrophy was found to scale with @xmath416 @xcite . on the other hand , the time @xmath385 when the maximum enstrophy is attained , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : emax_vse0_fixe](b ) , scales as @xmath417 , which should be contrasted with the scalings @xmath418 and @xmath419 found in the 1d and 2d cases , respectively .",
    "this implies that the time interval during which the extremal growth of enstrophy is sustained in 3d is shorter than the corresponding intervals in 1d and 2d .",
    "by constructing the initial data to exhibit the most extreme behaviour allowed for by the mathematically rigorous estimates , this study offers a fundamentally different perspective on the problem of searching for potentially singular solutions from most earlier investigations . indeed , while the corresponding flow evolutions did not reveal any evidence for finite - time singularity formation , the initial data obtained by maximizing @xmath1 produced a significantly larger growth of enstrophy in finite time than any other candidate initial conditions ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : initialconditions ] and figure [ fig : fvs_t_fixe ] ) . admittedly , this observation is limited to the initial data with @xmath420 , which corresponds to reynolds numbers @xmath421 lower than the reynolds numbers achieved in other studies concerned with the extreme behaviour in the navier - stokes flows @xcite .",
    "given that the definitions of the reynolds numbers applicable to the various flow configurations considered in these studies were not equivalent , it is rather difficult to make a precise comparison in terms of specific numerical values , but it is clear that the largest reynolds numbers attained in these investigations were at least an order of magnitude higher than used in the present study ; for euler flows such a comparison is obviously not possible at all .",
    "however , from the mathematical point of view , based on estimates  , there is no clear indication that a very large initial enstrophy @xmath0 ( or , equivalently , a high reynolds number ) should be a necessary condition for singularity formation in finite time .",
    "in fact , blow - up can not be a priori ruled out as soon as condition is violated , which happens for all initial data lying on the gray region of the phase space in figure [ fig : k0e0 ] .",
    "we remark that additional results were obtained ( not reported in this paper ) by studying the time evolution corresponding to the optimal initial data @xmath71 , but using smaller values of the viscosity coefficient @xmath422 , thereby artificially increasing the reynolds number at the price of making the initial data suboptimal .",
    "although these attempts did increase the amplification of enstrophy as compared to what was observed in figures [ fig : fg ] and [ fig : emax_vse0_fixe ] , no signature of finite - time singularity formation could be detected either .",
    "our study confirmed the earlier findings of @xcite about the sharpness of the instantaneous estimate .",
    "we also demonstrated that the finite - time estimate is saturated by the flow evolution corresponding to the optimal initial data @xmath71 , but only for short times , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : fg ] , which are not long enough to trigger a singular behaviour .    in  [ sec : discuss ] we speculated that a relatively small initial energy @xmath67 , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : rvse0_fixe_large](b ) , might be the property of the extreme vortex states @xmath71 preventing the resulting flow evolutions from sustaining a significant growth of enstrophy over long times .",
    "on the other hand , in introduction we showed that estimate need not be saturated for blow - up to occur in finite time and , in fact , sustained growth at the rate @xmath423 with any @xmath63 will also produce singularity in finite time .",
    "thus , another strategy to construct initial data which could lead to a more sustained growth of enstrophy in finite time might be to increase its kinetic energy by allowing for a smaller instantaneous rate of growth ( i.e. , with an exponent @xmath424 instead of @xmath425 ) .",
    "this can be achieved by prescribing an additional constraint in the formulation of the variational optimization problem , resulting in    [ pb : maxdedt_ke ] @xmath426    it differs from problem [ pb : maxdedt_e ] in that the maximizers are sought at the intersection of the original constraint manifold @xmath88 and the manifold defined by the condition @xmath427 , where @xmath428 is the prescribed energy . while computation of such maximizers is more complicated , robust techniques for the solution of optimization problems of this type have been developed and were successfully used in the 2d setting by @xcite .",
    "preliminary results obtained in the present setting by solving problem [ pb : maxdedt_ke ] for @xmath429 are indicated in figure [ fig : k0e0 ] , where we see that the flow evolutions starting from @xmath430 do not in fact produce a significant growth of enstrophy either .",
    "an alternative , and arguably more flexible approach , is to formulate this problem in terms of multiobjective optimization @xcite in which the objective function @xmath135 in problem [ pb : maxdedt_e ] would be replaced with @xmath431 where @xmath432 $ ] .",
    "solution of such a multiobjective optimization problem has the form of a `` pareto front '' parameterized by @xmath433 .",
    "clearly , the limits @xmath434 and @xmath435 correspond , respectively , to the extreme vortex states already found in  [ sec:3d_instopt_e0to0 ] and  [ sec:3d_instopt_e ] , and to the poincar limit .",
    "another interesting possibility is to replace the energy @xmath35 with the helicity @xmath436 in the multiobjective formulation , as this might allow one to obtain extreme vortex states with a more complicated topology ( i.e. , a certain degree of `` knottedness '' ) .",
    "we note that all the extreme vortex states found in the present study were `` unknotted '' , i.e. , were characterized by @xmath437 , as the vortex rings were in all cases disjoint ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : ring ] ) .    finally , another promising possibility to find initial data producing a larger growth of enstrophy is to solve a _",
    "finite - time _ optimization problem of the type already studied by @xcite in the context of the 1d burgers equation , namely    [ pb : maxde ] @xmath438    where @xmath439 is the length of the time interval of interest and @xmath359 the initial data for the navier - stokes system .",
    "in contrast to problems [ pb : maxdedt_e ] and [ pb : maxdedt_ke ] , solution of problem [ pb : maxde ] is more complicated as it involves flow evolution .",
    "it represents therefore a formidable computational task for the 3d navier - stokes system .",
    "however , it does appear within reach given the currently available computational resources and will be studied in the near future .",
