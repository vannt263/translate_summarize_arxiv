    "with the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc , an important step towards a complete identification of the structure of the mechanism of mass generation in the electroweak theory has been taken .",
    "however , it is clear that one needs suitable extensions of the current version of the standard model ( sm ) in order to solve some important theoretical and phenomenological issues which do not find an answer within the same model .",
    "these include , for instance , the absence of a mechanism which could account for the masses of the three generations of neutrinos , or the origin of its chiral nature as well as of the gauge charge assignments of the flavor sector . at theoretical level ,",
    "the latter are constrained only by the gauge symmetry together with the mechanism of cancelation of the gauge and of the gravitational anomalies , which provide significant restrictions on the possible interactions .",
    "+ analogously , the issue concerning the instability of the scalar potential of the sm under the perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) evolution up to the planck scale , which is another critical aspect of the same model , noticed long ago , has been exploited in the past @xcite to constrain the higgs mass , and it has been instrumental for later higgs searches , but it has also been viewed as one of its unappealing features . in this case , the basic motivation hinged on the belief that any approach which tries to connect the sm directly with the planck scale is probably untenable , as epitomised by the gauge - hierarchy problem . + with the recent lhc activity and the significant exclusion limits on the parameter space of possible supersymmetric models which have emerged from it , recurrent attempts to connect the sm with larger physical scales , particularly the planck scale , have resurfaced . in particular , the assumption of a _ big desert _ scenario , without any intermediate new physics , have forced many to reconsider the issue of its vacuum stability . in this framework ,",
    "finer inspections of the perturbative rg evolution of the sm scalar potential have become quite popular @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that although the sm scalar potential develops a new deeper minimum , the lifetime of the unstable electroweak vacuum is found to be much larger than the age of the universe .",
    "this feature , called metastability , taken at face value , suggests that the extrapolation of the sm up to the planck scale does not necessarily require the introduction of new physics .",
    "these issues have been and are widely debated also in cosmology @xcite , for a potential both at zero and at finite temperature .",
    "the role of these analyses has been to clarify , in view of the measured value of the higgs mass , if the sm stands solidly in a quantum field theory and cosmological context and , specifically , whether additional contributions to the running would resolve the issue related to its behavior .",
    "the study of the shape of the higgs effective potential @xmath2 , for large values of the higgs field , larger than the higgs vev @xmath3 @xmath4 , is critically important for coming to reasonable conclusions concerning the stability of the sm .",
    "if another minimum is found at @xmath5 , then the requirement of stability imposes that @xmath6 . in the opposite situation",
    ", the potential could be either completely unstable or metastable .",
    "+ as mentioned above , if @xmath7 , a metastable condition could be accepted as far as the tunnelling time @xmath8 for the transition from the false to the true vacuum of the higgs field is larger than the age of our universe @xmath9 . in the opposite case , with @xmath10 , one encounters a complete instability , which must be excluded .",
    "the rg analyses points to a metastable behavior which runs quite close to the region of instability in the parameter space @xcite .",
    "+ one of the unappealing issues of the sm potential lays in its critical dependence on the top quark @xmath11 and higgs @xmath12 masses .",
    "in fact , the effect of the fermions , and of the yukawa of the top quark in particular , on the rg evolution , is to drive the higgs quartic couplings @xmath13 towards negative values , upsetting the vacuum stability already at @xmath14 gev , but allowing for a long - lived vacuum . for this reason , in the pure sm scenario , precise measurements of the value of the top mass and the resolution of the ambiguities in the use of different renormalization schemes for its evaluation are important in order to lift the controversy @xcite @xcite . +",
    "this leaves open the possibility that new physics , around the electroweak scale and above , but below the planck scale @xmath15 , will drastically change this scenario , reducing such sensitivity or eliminating it all together @xcite . in these analyses ,",
    "the magnitude and the sign of the different contributions to the beta function @xmath16 of the higgs quartic coupling is crucial for a correct prediction .",
    "+ obviously , even simple modifications of the gauge structure of the sm , with the inclusion of one extra @xmath17 symmetry in the neutral currents sector allow to envision completely different scenarios where the issue of stability or of metastability finds alternative solutions .",
    "also in this case , though , the large yukawas of other heavy fermions play a similar role as the top quark , hinting that a complete solution of this issue involves the entire heavy flavor sector @xcite .",
    "+ the goal of our analysis , in this work , is to illustrate how the requirement of stability under the rg evolution of the parameters of the model is linked to the flavor sector of the same theory , as soon as we enlarge the scalar potential even in a minimal way .",
    "we will investigate this point rather thoroughly , by addressing the case of an extra @xmath0 symmetry , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the baryon and lepton numbers respectively , extending our previous one - loop analysis @xcite to two - loop level , and detailing many features which we have not discussed before .",
    "the model invokes a single extra higgs scalar ( the heavier higgs ) in the breaking of the extra abelian symmetry , beside the ordinary higgs doublet of the sm .",
    "several previous phenomenological analyses have addressed some of the salient features of this model , which is a front - runner in the hunting for a possible extra @xmath20 at the lhc @xcite .",
    "b - l is an anomaly - free and conserved symmetry of the sm , which plays an important role in grand unified theory ( gut s ) . + the current study is also characterized by the obvious inclusion in the rg running of the one - loop matching conditions at the electroweak scale , formerly considered by us only at tree - level .",
    "as we are going to show , these are essential in order to determine correctly the regions of stability of the potential .",
    "our equations also keep into account the effects due to the kinetic mixing of @xmath0 with the hypercharge . we have assumed for simplicity that the coupling @xmath21 which parameterizes the mixing is vanishing at the electroweak scale , and gets only generated radiatively in the upward running . for this reason ,",
    "our analysis is here focused on a _ pure _ b - l extra gauge structure at the electroweak scale .",
    "however , using our results , one can easily address different scenarios , under the assumption of a diagonal b - l and hypercharge ( @xmath22 ) symmetries at the gut scale , with a kinetic mixing induced by a reverse evolution from the gut scale towards the electroweak one .",
    "+ moreover , our work invokes a suitable mechanism of mass generation of the light neutrinos of the sm . as in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we consider a scenario based on a type - i seesaw realized with three heavy right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos which can be easily generalized to other mechanisms , such as to a type - ii , -iii , or to an inverse seesaw .",
    "+ concerning the specific charge assignments of the rh neutrinos , we rely on the general conditions of anomaly cancellation",
    ". the solutions of the corresponding equations depend significantly on the number of heavy rh neutrinos ( @xmath23 ) selected in the model , which in our case is one per generation , and we have opted for a symmetric charge assignment of the @xmath24 under @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , other solutions can be considered as well .",
    "+ in any case , the pattern that emerges from this analysis is quite insensitive to the gauge charges , while remaining quite sensitive to all the other parameters which characterize the potential and the fermion sector .",
    "as we are going to point out , these can be traded for the mass of the extra @xmath20 , @xmath25 , and its gauge coupling @xmath26 , the mixing angle @xmath27 of the two higgses , the mass of the heavy higgs @xmath28 and the masses of the rh neutrinos .",
    "the gauge symmetric extension that we consider has the same content of the sm augmented by a single extra @xmath29 factor , i.e. @xmath30 , with @xmath29 later identified with @xmath0 .",
    "the higgs sector includes one extra complex scalar @xmath31 , beside the higgs , @xmath32 , which will be discussed thoroughly in the next sections .",
    "+ in this section we briefly review the conditions imposed by the cancellation of the anomalies , which constrain significantly the @xmath29 charge assignments of the model . as already discussed in previous analysis @xcite , these conditions can be combined with extra requirements on the mass generation in the fermion sector , i.e. on the type of operators chosen in order to provide masses for the neutrinos . in general",
    ", these extra requirements may involve operators of mass dimension larger than four . in this context , the choice , for instance , of a type - i seesaw for the neutrino masses with three sm singlet right - handed neutrinos is , for sure , quite economical and carries the advantage of preserving the renormalizability of the model . + we assign generic charges @xmath33 for the left - handed ( lh ) quark and lepton doublets @xmath34 , and the charges @xmath35 for the right - handed ( rh ) @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 quarks and leptons",

    "the aforementioned analysis have been carried out in the minimal @xmath0 extension in which the mixing between the @xmath83 and the @xmath20 gauge bosons has been neglected . a more complete analysis of the kinetic mixing of this model , although quite constrained by electroweak precision data @xcite , and the possibility of exploring different charge assignments for the new abelian gauge symmetry",
    "are left to future studies .",
    "+ the rg analysis has been performed employing two - loop @xmath102 functions and one - loop matching relations on the initial conditions at the electroweak scale .",
    "we have shown that such higher - order corrections affect considerably the running of the couplings and , probably , should always be kept into account in any significant phenomenological analysis .",
    "they are essential for a consistent identification of the allowed regions in the parameter space of a given model , under the requirements of perturbativity and of vacuum stability .",
    "+ following this reasoning , one finds that a charge assignment of b - l type , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig.pertcoupgeneric ] and [ fig.pertcoup ] , can be characterized by a perturbative behaviour up to the planck scale .",
    "+ we have seen that the requirements of perturbativity and stability of the scalar potential constrain the masses of the heavy higgs and of the rh neutrinos quite significantly .",
    "the boundaries of the allowed region , for a given mass of the @xmath20 , depend on the values of the scalar mixing angle @xmath27 and of the abelian coupling @xmath26 .",
    "we have also verified that the transition from a region of stability to an unstable one can be quite abrupt , and may depend quite significantly on the mass of the rh neutrino , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ shadows ] . this feature can be ascribed to the evolution of the scalar coupling @xmath123 , and , in particular , to the yukawa ( @xmath101 ) of the rh neutrinos which affects their masses . as already mentioned above",
    ", the roles of @xmath101 and of @xmath115 , from this perspective , appear to be quite similar .",
    "finally , we have also investigated the impact of the kinetic mixing on the evolution of the @xmath195 symmetries .",
    "+ there are other aspects , not touched in this analysis , and that we leave to future studies , which concern the inclusion of this model into a specific unified theory .",
    "it is well know that multiple @xmath17 factors are often encountered in the breaking of a gut scenario , or in the construction of effective theories from string models @xcite so that it is natural to ask what a vacuum stability analysis can add in predictivity using the corresponding rge s . from our point of view",
    "its use in this context can be dual . without any prior knowledge of a particular breaking pattern ,",
    "the study of the instabilities of the scalar potential gives an indication of the validity of the @xmath196 gauge symmetry as a residual one , valid at low energy , before calling for a uv completion ( either of gut type or else ) .",
    "more significant theoretical constraints on the parameter space can instead be drawn when the model is embedded in a particular gut scenario . in this case",
    "the stability of the vacuum between the threshold scales of the intermediate breakings is a necessary condition for its consistency . from this perspective",
    ", our study clarifies that a heavy neutrino mass may challenge specific gut models .",
    "indeed , we have shown that the running of the corresponding yukawa couplings could spoil the perturbativity and the stability of the vacuum if a new threshold is not sufficiently near the tev scale .",
    "+ another important point concerns the role of a tev b - l scenario respect to the constraints that could be imposed by requiring a successful leptogenesis . analysis in this direction have been presented in @xcite .",
    "we have verified that also in the model that we have considered , the value of the baryon abundance @xmath197 , which depends on product of the cp - asymmetry of the heavy neutrinos decays ( @xmath198 ) and on the efficiency factor @xmath199 , can account for the current estimated value of @xmath200 .",
    "@xmath201 is temperature dependent and is calculated at the sphaleron freeze - out temperature @xmath199 .",
    "it is responsible for the amount of washout of the baryon asymmetry , which can be dangerously low when the condition @xmath202 is realized @xcite . always in a context of a very strong near - degeneracy of the heavy neutrinos , a pattern which can be completely encompassed by our choice of a scalar @xmath101",
    ", we have found regions , in the parameter space that we have analysed , which are compatible with leptogenesis .",
    "for instance , for a mass of the extra @xmath20 of 2.5 tev and a coupling @xmath157 , we have verified that the requirement of a maximal value of the cp - asymmetry parameter @xmath198 starts to allow leptogenesis ( @xmath203 ) if @xmath204 gev .",
    "meanwhile , less stringent values of @xmath198 , @xmath205 , are feasible if @xmath206 gev and @xmath207 tev respectively .",
    "we have found , as expected , that an increment of the strength of the @xmath20 coupling @xmath26 strongly disfavours the leptogenesis scenario , since it intensifies the washout of the asymmetry , for a 2.5 tev gauge boson .",
