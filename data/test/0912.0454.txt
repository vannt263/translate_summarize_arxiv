    "it has been realized since quite some time that several extensions of the standard model ( sm ) share similar signatures at the lhc , as , for example , that of jets , leptons , and missing transverse energy  @xcite .",
    "this is because such extensions typically have partners of the sm , with gauge quantum numbers equal to those of the sm particles  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric models , extra - dimensional ones , and little higgs models are indeed of this type . among them",
    ", supersymmetric models stand out because the partners have spins that differ by @xmath12 from those of the sm particles , whereas in the other extensions have the same spins .",
    "this has prompted several proposal of methods for determining the spin of heavy unstable particles  @xcite .",
    "thus , supersymmetric models are also the only ones , at least so far , in which there exist irreducible renormalizable interactions of four matter partners , of type @xmath13 .",
    "such interactions may , therefore , offer a new handle to discriminate supersymmetry ( susy ) from other extensions of the sm .",
    "the lhc being a hadronic machine , quartic couplings of sleptons , @xmath14 , contribute only to processes whose cross sections are suppressed by many powers of the electroweak couplings .",
    "the signals of quartic couplings of squarks , @xmath15 , may not be easily disentangled from those due to a pair of squarks .",
    "the first , simplest scrutiny of quartic couplings , therefore , may be that of couplings of two sleptons and two squarks @xmath16 . combined with the strong interaction vertices of squarks and gluons , these give rise , at the quantum level , to the effective couplings @xmath17 , and therefore to the gluon - initiated production of a pair of slepton .    since higgs bosons couple to both",
    ", a pair of fermions and a pair of scalars , reducible couplings of four sm partners , two quark partners and two lepton partners , can be built through the exchange of higgs bosons also in models in which the partner spins do not differ from those of the sm particles .",
    "thus , the gluon - fusion production of a pair of lepton partners is not a special feature of supersymmetric models .",
    "the possibility of discriminating susy through this type of studies strongly relies on the impact that the irreducible quartic couplings of supersymmetric models can have .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the one - loop process @xmath17 via quartic couplings , was never studied before .",
    "surprisingly , very little exists in the literature also about the same process induced by the exchange of a higgs boson , @xmath18 .",
    "it was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath19 , the lightest higgs bosons . since this has a mass clearly below the slepton - pair threshold , the cross section was found to be very small .",
    "the study of this process was put aside until the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite realized that the cross section could increase if @xmath20 is one of the two heavier neutral higgs bosons @xmath21 .",
    "neverheless , not much attention has been given to this proposal .",
    "although suppressed by a loop factor and by the coupling @xmath22 with respect to that of the standard drell - yan production @xmath23 , the gluon - fusion cross sections may be favoured by the fact that , at the lhc , gluon - initiated processes may dominate over the quark - initiated ones .",

    "the same spectrum gives a cross section up to @xmath210fb for the production of a pair of opposite - chirality @xmath4 s even for @xmath211 and chirality mixing terms in the @xmath4 sector practically negligible .",
    "notice with the same type of slepton spectrum , only same - chirality sleptons can be produced through the drell - yan production mechanism  @xcite .",
    "we have not given explicit values of the cross sections when chirality - mixing terms in the squarks and slepton sectors are nonvanishing , and for large values of @xmath53 , but we have argued why we expect the cross section to increase in this case , at least for sleptons still relatively light . a full - fledged analysis should be performed with more realistic squark spectra than those used here , which were devised to maximize the gluon - fusion cross sections from quartic - couplings . moreover , when @xmath53 is large , the tree - level process @xmath212 mediated by higgs boson exchange , should also be added , incoherently , to the previous processes , in order to give a correct assessment of the values that the gluon - initiated cross section can reach .",
    "this is because the @xmath207 quark is contained in the proton via a gluon and the @xmath213-initiated cross section is of the same order in @xmath22 than those studied here .",
    "finally , where the gluon - fusion mechanism of slepton production stands with respect to the drell  yan production depends also strongly on the role played by the qcd corrections to the two types of processes .",
    "higher - order qcd corrections should indeed be included , together with susy - qcd corrections .",
    "the qcd corrections for the gluon - fusion mechanism are as those for the production of higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "they are known to be large , more than the corrections that qcd induces in the case of the drell  yan production  @xcite .",
    "the susy - qcd corrections are also well known  @xcite . at large @xmath53 those to the higgs boson",
    "vertex may be well approximated  @xcite by the usual yukawa coupling corrections .",
    "it is widely believed that , if at all , sleptons will be discovered at the lhc through cascade decays .",
    "the production of a pair of sleptons , if kinematically allowed , will provide their direct mass measurement .",
    "not much more than this can be learned from the drell - yan production .",
    "the gluon - fusion production mechanism , in this respect is potentially much more interesting since it can provide valuable information about @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , and confirmations about the higgs spectrum .",
    "both mechanisms contribute to the pair production of sleptons , and the total cross section may be larger than previously thought , at least for resonant higgs exchange .",
    "more detailed studies on this subject are clearly needed .",
    "going back to the issue of quartic couplings , an extended gauge structure , for example with an anomalous u(1)@xmath40 in which the cancellation mechanism can be avoided , may help with their detection .",
    "it is however possible that the hadron collider environment is not the best suited for this purpose . the possibilities that a linear collider may offer in this respect should be explored .    in the case of its photon - collider option , for example , it is easy to find a situation that parallels very closely the one described here of a pair of sleptons , which , in spite of not being sensitive to strong interactions , can nevertheless couple at the one - loop level to a pair of gluons , thanks to their quartic couplings to squark pairs .",
    "the situation that immediately comes to mind is that of a pair of neutral scalars that can be coupled at the one - loop level to two photons thanks to their quartic couplings to a pair of charged scalars .",
    "if the two neutral particles are supersymmetric higgs bosons , the situation can actually be much better than that of slepton production discussed here .",
    "indeed , the cancellation mechanism above described , which does work if the charged particles exchanged in the loop are squarks , is violated when these scalars are sleptons .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the neutral components of the su(2)@xmath31 slepton doublets can not couple to photons .",
    "the production of a pair of supersymmetric higgs bosons in a photon collider was already considered in several papers  @xcite . the charged slepton contribution to the loop ,",
    "is mentioned only in ref .",
    "it is , however , difficult to understand from this analysis the relevance of this contribution .",
    "it may remain buried under possibly larger contributions , not only those due to the exchange of higgs bosons , but also those coming from box diagrams , that have no correspondent in our case of slepton production .",
    "a check of the relative size of all these contributions would probably be worthwhile .     + the authors thank e.  accomando , b.  allanach , k.  fujii , j.s .",
