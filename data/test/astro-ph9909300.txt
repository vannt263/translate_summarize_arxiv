    "when evaluating justification for new facilities , one may question whether and by how much the new technique is superior to already existing ones .",
    "we describe a general approach which leads to a quantitative answer , expressed as a relative figure of merit of two observational techniques .",
    "the approach is based on the comparison of the corresponding errors in the model parameters determination .",
    "the derived figure of merit can also be used in the closely related problem of optimization of complex observations , thus contributing in maximizing their scientific output .",
    "we illustrate the developed method by comparing the technique of optical long baseline interferometry to the classical spectroscopy , both used to find the parameters of the gaseous envelope around the p cyg star . for this first trial application",
    ", we use simulated data , obtained by solving the radiative transfer problem for grids of physical models of the envelope and then adding the photon noise .",
    "the chosen example of the interferometry vs spectroscopy comparison appears to be timely . indeed , in the recent years",
    ", interferometry has been undergoing a steady progress witnessed by publication of fringe visibilities for circumstellar envelopes of various types sometimes combined with a good spectral resolution ( mourard et al .",

    "@xcite ) . while this effort is fully justified , for the knowledge of the flux distribution on small angular scales can unveil important new features of astrophysical objects , it is also justified to wonder whether this effort is well payed for all classes of objects and for all kinds of physical problems . as a matter of fact , interferometric observations as compared to those at a single telescope are more complex , more expensive , more time consuming , and , when possible to compare , have a larger accumulated measurement error due to their complexity . furthermore , in the foreseeable future the instruments of this type will remain orders of magnitude less numerous and by all given reasons much less available for the community than single telescopes .",
    "thus , it makes sense to evaluate in quantitative terms what are the targets for which the interferometric instrumentation has the highest potential in terms of astrophysical information as compared to single telescopes .",
    "also , the optimization of interferometric observations may be a crucial aspect .",
    "indeed , the existing and forthcoming long baseline interferometers comprise only few individual apertures , covering a small set of spatial frequencies during one observing cycle . on the other hand , the information provided by observations can depend critically on spatial frequencies .",
    "certainly , in such a situation the scientific yield of the interferometric array could be greatly improved if thorough model calculations can indicate the configurations expected to be the most useful for determination of aimed physical parameters of the object .    not surprisingly , the relative figure of merit derived in the present article depends not only on the experimental techniques , but also on the chosen set of model parameters , reflecting the fact that the physical model makes a necessary part of the merit problem . however , in modern astronomy , designing and building instrumentation on the one hand , and modeling objects on the other hand , were pushed to such a level of sophistication that they are as a rule two distinct activities .",
    "the optimum use of interferometry needs a close collaboration of two communities .",
    "after these preliminary remarks , let us specify that in the present first trial application , our discussion will be limited to the comparison of observations with a two - aperture optical long baseline interferometer ( hereafter olbi ) and the classical single telescope spectroscopy ( hereafter shortly spectroscopy ) , both applied to study a circumstellar gaseous envelope formed by the wind of a massive star .",
    "the olbi observations are assumed to have the same spectral resolution as spectroscopy . the discussion will be further limited to spectral profiles and visibilities in the h@xmath1 line of the p  cyg envelope , allowing to use published high quality observations both in olbi and spectroscopic , and thus to provide a clear numerical illustration .    in our earlier attempts to solve the olbi vs spectroscopy merits problem ( burgin & chalabaev @xcite ; bourguine & chalabaev @xcite ) , we used qualitative comparison of observables , visibility and spectral profile , computed for a small number of envelope models .",
    "the results were ambiguous .",
    "analising them , we arrived to the firm conviction that meaningful conclusions can be obtained only if ( 1 ) intercomparison of different types of observations is performed using a clearly defined figure of merit , indicating how much information on the studied object is provided by various techniques , and ( 2 ) a sufficiently large ranges in the space of envelope model parameters are analyzed .    in the case of p",
    "cyg , the required number of computed models ( see sect .  [ results ] ) turned out to be @xmath2 .",
    "an efficient simplified envelope model code , computing the emergent spectral profile and visibilities for the h@xmath1 line , was developed and is described in sect .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "we considered only spherically symmetric outflow models , the choice which is justified in sect .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "we consider astrophysical observations and their interpretation in the framework of the theory of parameter estimation ( e.g. kendall & stuart @xcite ) .",
    "that is , the observed object is assumed to be exactly described by a fixed multiparametric physical model , the errors being solely those of the experimental measurements ( see however sect .  [ systerrs ] ) .",
    "any observable quantity is then a function of the vector of @xmath3 model parameters @xmath4 .",
    "an observation consists in finding the values of @xmath5 observables @xmath6 , where each observable @xmath7 is either measured directly or can be calculated in a model - independent way as a known function of directly measurable quantities .",
    "obviously , observations with instruments of different types provide observables of different number and nature .",
    "the @xmath8-th observable can be represented as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the `` theoretical '' value of corresponding observable in the absence of observational errors and @xmath11 is the random vector of observational errors , which is assumed here to be distributed normally .",
    "we consider the case when @xmath12 and the parameters @xmath13 could have been uniquely determined if the vector @xmath14 were known .",
    "we shall call the parameters to be determined the `` target parameters '' and denote a set of @xmath15 target parameters , or target set , as @xmath16 .",
    "it is possible that @xmath17 and the set @xmath16 is a proper subset of the set of all parameters of the model .",
    "the situation of this kind may arise for two reasons .",
    "first , a model parameter may be set to some a priori fixed value because , say , it has been measured earlier by entirely different methods .",
    "this reduces the dimension of the problem and computational difficulties , the general method remaining the same .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the set of @xmath19 fixed parameters , and @xmath20 be the value a priori assigned to a parameter @xmath21 .",
    "secondly , some of the unknown physical parameters may eventually be considered `` not interesting '' if their values are not relevant to the astrophysical problem under study .",
    "following the theory of parameter estimation , we will call them the `` nuisance '' parameters and denote the set of nuisance parameters , or `` nuisance set '' , as @xmath22 , their number being @xmath23 . as a rule",
    ", their influence can be separated in the error analysis only at the final stage of computations , for their values are to be calculated along with the values of target parameters .",
    "interpretation of an observation consists in calculating the vector @xmath24 that provides the best fit to the observed values .",
    "here @xmath25 is the index of the component of vector @xmath26 corresponding to the same model parameter as the @xmath8-th target parameter ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the precision of the values @xmath28 resulting from interpretation of the observations is characterized by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where for any random vector @xmath31 expressions @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote its mean and its covariance matrix respectively , and @xmath34    in what follows , we assume that @xmath35 is an unbiased estimate of @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath36 , and that the measurement errors are small enough , so that the error analysis can be performed using the linearized version of the least squares method .",
    "we additionally assume that all a priori fixed parameters are set to their true values ( see however [ systerrs ] ) , that is @xmath37 for any @xmath21 , then @xmath38 and statistical properties of errors in parameter determination are completely characterized by the covariance matrix of errors c = d.      according to kendall & stuart ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap.19 ) ) , the covariance matrix of errors c is related to @xmath14 and @xmath39 by the following expression : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the @xmath42 matrix with elements @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the vector of experimental errors defined in sect .",
    "[ general - theory ] .",
    "the natural scalar characteristics of the precision of parameter determination for a given set @xmath16 of target parameters is the following principal subdeterminant of the covariance matrix : @xmath46 geometrically , this subdeterminant is proportional to the hypervolume of the scattering ellipsoid in the space of target parameters .",
    "it depends not only on the physical model and errors of measurements , but also on the analytical form used for description of the model : two physically equivalent but mathematically different ( e.g. interrelated by a reversible substitution of variables ) analytical representations could yield entirely different values of @xmath47 .    however , a pair of observational methods can well be compared if one makes use of the ratio @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the subdeterminants calculated for the observation of the same object with instruments i and ii . this ratio depends only on the physical model used , and the obtained precision on the model parameters .",
    "we shall call the quantity @xmath51 , introduced by the eq .",
    "( [ rdef ] ) , the `` random error ratio '' , or the `` relative figure of merit '' .    if the instruments are of the same kind , and differ from each other only in precision , the value @xmath51 is merely the ratio of observational errors .",
    "if the instruments are of different kinds , providing observables of different nature and number , and the target set consists of only one model parameter , the value @xmath51 is merely the ratio of resulting random errors in the parameter determination .",
    "however , in the general case of instruments of arbitrary kinds and multiparametric models , no simple ratio of errors exists , and the evaluation of relative merits can be done only using the quantity @xmath52 defined by eq .",
    "( [ rdef ] ) .",
    "it allows to compare various observational techniques applied to objects described by various multiparametric models : equality @xmath53 means that the instrument i is better suited for determination of parameters from the target set than the instrument ii .",
    "the fact that the description of an object by a multiparametric physical model is only an approximation to the reality implies that we have to consider the robustness of the method , that is the stability of the results it yields with respect to deviations of the real situation from the model .",
    "the present framework offers a way to obtain certain quantitative characteristics of the robustness .",
    "indeed , let us consider a multiparametric model with @xmath54 . if @xmath55 for some @xmath21 then , in general , @xmath56 for @xmath57",
    "that is , in addition to random errors of observational origin , the result is biased by systematic errors due to inaccurate interpretation .",
    "the value of that bias characterizes the robustness of the method with respect to deviations of @xmath20 from its true value .    in the linear approximation , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the @xmath60 matrix with elements @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "a comprehensive study of systematic errors requires a joint analysis of individual elements of the matrix @xmath59 and uncertainties in model parameters from @xmath63 . in the present paper",
    ", we will develop a simplified approach providing semiquantitative indications concerning the relative robustness of different observational techniques .",
    "let us first define for each observational method under consideration the value @xmath64 when the estimates for target parameters are uncorrelated with estimates for parameters from @xmath63 , equality @xmath65 takes place : the method is robust ( with respect to deviations of specified form from the model ) .",
    "when such a correlation exists , @xmath66 exceeds unity ; the closer the correlation , the larger its value , eventually implying poor robustness of the method .",
    "further , to compare the robustness of methods i and ii with respect to inaccuracies in parameters from @xmath63 , we will define the `` robustness ratio @xmath67 '' as follows : @xmath68 where function @xmath69 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ rdef ] ) . note that once the values of @xmath70 , which are necessary for analysis of random errors , are found , comparison of robustness is straightforward .",
    "in this section we obtain the expressions for the elements of the covariance matrix @xmath71 in the form that can be directly used to compare the olbi and spectroscopy .",
    "first , the measurement errors have to be specified .",
    "for this first trial application , the only considered source of random errors is the photon noise .",
    "other sources of error , in particular those in olbi arising from atmospheric seeing and calibrations of the modulation transfer function ( see roddier & lna @xcite ; mourard et al .",
    "@xcite ) are important and has to be incorporated in a future work .",
    "also , the spectral coverage and the spectral resolution have to be specified .",
    "we assume that they are the same for both kinds of observations ; the covered spectral region is @xmath72 $ ] , the spectral resolution is sufficiently high , i.e. the monochromatic intensity received from each point of the observed object remains nearly constant across each spectral channel . in other words , we assume that @xmath73 , the width of the spectral channels , in terms of velocity is lesser than the thermal velocity of the emitting atoms . for the p  cyg type envelopes",
    "this corresponds to @xmath74 , which is easily satisfied with modern spectrographs .",
    "then one can formally consider the convenient limit case @xmath75 . in this case , the resulting covariance matrices tend to a limit which is independent of the spectral resolution ( cf .",
    "( [ cspec ] ) and ( [ colbi ] ) ) .",
    "the physical quantity provided by spectroscopy is the flux density as a function of wavelength . in terms of observables",

    "the random values @xmath78 are related to the physical parameters of the object by @xmath80 where @xmath81 @xmath82 is the monochromatic flux from the object at wavelength @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the width of @xmath8-th spectral channel , and @xmath85 is the measurement error due to the photon noise , with the variance given by @xmath86 finally the factor @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the instrument effective aperture and @xmath90 is the exposure time .",
    "hereafter we suppose that @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 pertain correspondingly to the spectrometer and interferometer .",

    "we consider the case of a two - aperture olbi with an adjustable baseline .",
    "the physical quantity eventually provided by olbi measurements is the fringe visibility v as a function of the baseline vector .",
    "the visibility v is equal to the real part of the complex degree of coherence , and therefore is the fourier transform of the brightness distribution in the focal plane by virtue of the van cittert - zernicke theorem ( e.g. mariotti @xcite , textbooks of perina @xcite , and goodman @xcite ) .",

    "the star p  cyg ( b1 iape ) is characterized by a high mass - loss rate and exhibits bright optical emission lines , formed in the dense and nearly fully ionized stellar wind .",
    "it belongs to the class of luminous blue variables , a short - living transition phase in the evolution of a massive star at the end of the hydrogen burning ( see e.g. humphreys & davidson @xcite , langer et al .",
    "@xcite , maeder @xcite ) .",
    "there were at least two strong reasons to choose p  cyg as the astrophysical object of the present study .",
    "first , this bright object , @xmath123 , is one of the best studied emission line stars .",
    "although in this first trial we use simulated data , it is important to note that for p  cyg there exists a rich literature providing not only high quality spectroscopic data ( e.g. scuderi et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but also interferometric data ( vakili et al .",
    "@xcite ) , as well as thorough theoretical analysis ( drew @xcite ; pauldrach & puls @xcite ) .",
    "this insures that the present work can be followed up by a practical application .",
    "secondly , it happens that in the growing list of outflows known to be non - spherical ( e.g. wolf , stahl , fullerton @xcite ) , that of p  cyg is an exception exhibiting spherical symmetry to a good degree of accuracy ( nota @xcite ) , becoming clumpy only on short time and small flux scales ( taylor et al .",
    "@xcite ; vakili et al .",
    "@xcite ; nota @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the assumption of spherical symmetry of the envelope , used in the present work , is realistic .",
    "let us remind that it allows to compute a model in a reasonable amount of time , and thus to explore a large domain of parametric space , which is a requirement for the evaluation results to be meaningful .    for the distance to the star @xmath124 , its radius @xmath125 and the effective temperature @xmath126 we adopted the following values : @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 ( lamers et al .",
    "@xcite ; pauldrach & puls @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum of the star was assumed to be blackbody .",
    "our study is limited to the hydrogen h@xmath1 line , which is the most prominent and the best studied feature in the spectrum of the star .",
    "the mass distribution within a spherically symmetric and stationary outflow is described by its mass loss rate @xmath130 and the outflow velocity @xmath131 , which we assume to depend on radial distance @xmath132 in the following way : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the terminal velocity of the wind , @xmath135 is velocity of the wind at the base of the photosphere , and @xmath1 is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the rate at which the velocity approachs its asymptotic value at large @xmath132 .",
    "the radial distance @xmath132 is measured in units of stellar radius @xmath125 , while @xmath130 , @xmath135 , @xmath134 , and @xmath1 are parameters of a model .    the temperature in the envelope is often assumed to be constant .",
    "however , as it was shown by drew ( @xcite ) , across the region of the h@xmath1 line formation @xmath136 the temperature in the envelope can vary by as much as 6000k .",
    "therefore , along with isothermal models , we also computed the emergent emission for non - isothermal models .    to keep a finite number of scalar parameters , the dependence of envelope temperature @xmath137 on radial distance is approximated in the following manner",

    "however , it would have a low accuracy if applied in the p  cyg case , for a noticeable fraction of h@xmath1 flux is emitted in the inner part of envelope , where the outflow velocity is comparable to that of sound .",
    "we adopted a mixed method computing the source function in the sobolev approximation , and then finding the emergent intensities by exact numerical solution of the transfer equation .",
    "as it was shown by hamann ( @xcite ) , the errors in line profiles computed in the original sobolev approximation come mainly from calculations of the emergent intensities , whereas the source function is accurate for a wide range of physical conditions .",
    "the choice of the model of the hydrogen atom was based on the fact that the regions of the envelope emitting the major fraction of the h@xmath1 flux are nearly completely ionized and opaque to lyman continuum and l@xmath1 , so that direct recombinations to and photoionizations from the ground level cancel out , and l@xmath1 is saturated ( drew @xcite ) .",
    "the populations of levels @xmath152 and @xmath153 are mainly defined by collisional and radiative transitions between these two levels , radiative ionizations due to stellar radiation , and radiative recombinations ( including indirect ) to the level @xmath153 .",
    "we therefore adopted the three - level + continuum model of hydrogen atom .",
    "the balance equations for @xmath154 and @xmath155 , the number densities of hydrogen atoms respectively at levels 2 and 3 , take then the following form : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the spontaneous emission coefficient , @xmath158 and @xmath159 are collisional excitation and de - excitation coefficients for the transition , @xmath160 and @xmath161 are respectively ionizations coefficients and recombination rates for the levels involved , and @xmath162 is the escape probability .",

    "in contrast to @xmath226 , the value @xmath228 is close to unity for all projected baseline lengths and combinations of sets @xmath238 and @xmath22 that we have studied .",
    "this signifies that for any projected baselength there exists a combination of model parameters for which interferometry practically do not provide reduction in error .",
    "it is interesting to notice that for target sets containing several parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ 3lmultyt ] ) , the influence of individual parameters on @xmath226 and @xmath228 to some extent averages out : @xmath226 is systematically higher , and @xmath228 is systematically lower than the corresponding values for individual parameters . for this reason ,",
    "when more than one model parameter is to be determined , interferometry at a single projected baselength is unlikely to yield overall gain in accuracy in excess of factor of two even at optimal baselines .",
    "we studied further the effect of increasing the number of sublayers @xmath239 , which permits to investigate the influence of fine details of the thermal structure of the envelope .",
    "this appears to be justified for drew ( @xcite ) showed that in certain cases this structure is quite complex , and gradient of @xmath240 varies strongly with radial distance .",
    "consequently , a model aiming to closely approximate the realistic envelope should be parameterized using a large @xmath239 ( see sect .",
    "[ stpars ] ) and hence requires computations on grids of high dimension @xmath197 .",
    "since the number of mesh points of the grid depends on @xmath197 exponentially , for computations based on such complex models ( grids 59 from table  [ grids ] ) the limited computer resources dictate sparser mesh points along each axis of the parameter space and a tuning of parameters controlling the computational process in such a way as to increase the speed of computation at the expense of precision .",
    "although numerically less precise than computations for simpler models , our results for more realistic grids indicate that the conclusions derived for low @xmath239 can be safely extrapolated for higher @xmath239 .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 5l1 + 7 ] showing the results for single - parameter target sets for grid  7 .    as it can be seen in figs .",
    "[ 3lmerr][5l1 + 7 ] and is confirmed by our other results not presented here , the distribution of optimal projected baseline lengths in the majority of cases has a maximum in the range 0.40.8 in dimensionless units . in some cases this maximum shifts to higher baseline lengths , but this occurs only for a very special choice of @xmath16 that correspond to measurements of wind temperature gradient at the distances of several stellar radii from the star with all other model parameters considered nuisance ( see e.g. bottom plots in figs .  [ 3l1 + 5 ] and [ 5l1 + 7 ] ) .",
    "thus , the aforementioned range , corresponding to 4590  m in linear scale , can be recommended as the optimal choice for interferometric observations aimed at determination of global characteristics of the p  cyg wind .    the typical dependence of the robustness ratio + @xmath241 on the baseline length and the set of fixed parameters for a model with adjustable thermal structure is shown in fig .",

    "thus , our results indicate that if the baseline length and the model used for interpretation are chosen in such a way as to reduce random errors , olbi appears also able to reduce the systematic errors .",
    "using the theory of model parameter determination , we developed a general method which permits a quantitative comparison of observational techniques and optimization of complex observations through the relative figure of merit , defined as a generalization of the ratio of random errors of model parameters .",
    "the method was applied to compare the outcome of olbi and classical spectroscopic observations , both used to determine the parameters of the outflow of the p  cyg star .",

    "the olbi and spectroscopic measurements errors were simulated assuming that the only source of errors is the counting statistics , i.e. we considered a nearly - ideal interferometer .",
    "other main assumptions and simplifications of the present work were as follows : ( 1 ) the p  cyg wind is stationary and spherically symmetric ; ( 2 ) the only olbi observable considered here is the visibility modulus ; ( 3 ) only the hydrogen h@xmath1 line is considered .",
    "the main conclusions of the present work are as follows :    1 .",
    "a meaningful evaluation of the olbi vs spectroscopy relative figure of merit requires exploration of large domain of the model parametric space ( about @xmath0 points computed in the present work ) .",
    "2 .   if the p  cyg outflow can be accurately described by a simple model of a stationary spherically symmetric isothermal envelope , then the use of interferometry does not substantially reduce the random error in the model parameter determination .",
    "3 .   if the p  cyg outflow requires more complex models , e.g. with a priori unknown dependence of the envelope temperature on radial distance , use of a nearly - ideal interferometer can reduce errors in model parameters by an order of magnitude as compared to the spectrometer of the same collecting power and noise level .",
    "the study of the relative robustness , i.e. the stability of the obtained model parameter determination with respect to systematic biases in the model , indicates that when the olbi and the physical model reduce random errors , they also tend to reduce the systematic error .",
    "the optimal projected baseline lengths for observation of p  cyg with a nearly ideal interferometer lie in the range 4590 m. 6 .",
    "if several model parameters are to be determined simultaneously , the olbi observations at a single projected baseline can not provide a substantial error reduction .",
