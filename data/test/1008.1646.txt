    "the large - order behavior of a perturbative expansion in gauge theories is inevitably dominated by the factorial growth of renormalon diagrams [ 1 - 4 ] . in the case of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the coefficients of perturbative expansions in the qcd coupling @xmath1 can increase dramatically even at low orders .",
    "this fact , together with the apparent freedom in the choice of renormalization scheme and renormalization scales , limits the predictive power of perturbative calculations , even in applications involving large momentum transfers , where @xmath1 is effectively small .",
    "a number of theoretical approaches have been developed to reorganize the perturbative expansions in an effort to improve the predictability of the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "for example , optimized scale and scheme choices have been proposed , such as the method of effective charges ( ech ) [ 5 ] , the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) [ 6 ] , and the brodsky - lepage - mackenize ( blm ) scale - setting prescription [ 7 ] and its generalizations [ 8 - 20 ] . in ref.[4 ] , the resummation of the formally divergent renormalon series and the parametrization of related higher - twist power - suppressed contributions has been given .",
    "in general , a factorially divergent renormalon series arises when one integrates over the logarithmically running coupling @xmath2 in a loop diagram .",
    "such contributions do not occur in conformally invariant theories which have a constant coupling .",
    "of course , in the physical theory , the qcd coupling does run .    among the fundamental predictions of qcd are asymptotic scaling laws for large - angle exclusive processes [ 21 - 28 ] .",
    "qcd counting rules were formalized in refs.[22,23 ] .",
    "these reactions probe hadronic constituents at large relative momenta , or equivalently , the hadronic wave function at short distances .",
    "in particular , the meson wave function determines the leading higher - twist contribution to meson production at high @xmath0 .",
    "the hadronic wave functions in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom play an important role in the quantum chromodynamics predictions for hadronic processes . in the perturbative qcd theory ,",
    "the hadronic distribution amplitudes and structure functions which enter exclusive and inclusive processes via the factorization theorems at high momentum transfers can be determined by the hadronic wave functions , and therefore they are the underlying links between hadronic phenomena in qcd at large ( nonperturbative ) and small distances ( perturbative ) .",
    "if the hadronic wave functions were accurately known , then we could calculate the hadronic distribution amplitude and structure functions for exclusive and inclusive processes in qcd .",
    "the study of hadron production at large transverse momenta in hadronic interactions is a valuable testing ground of the perturbative regime of qcd , providing information on both the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the proton , and the parton - to - hadron fragmentation functions ( ffs)[29 ] .",
    "the frozen coupling constant approach can be applied for investigation , not only for exclusive processes , but also for the calculation of higher - twist contributions to some inclusive processes , for example as large -@xmath3 meson photoproduction [ 30 ] , two - jet+meson production in the electron - positron annihilation [ 31 ] . in the frozen coupling constant approach",
    "was used refs.[30,31 ] for calculation of integrals , such as @xmath4 according to ref.[7 ] , in pqcd calculations , the argument @xmath5 of the running coupling constant should be taken equal to the square of the momentum transfer of a hard gluon in a corresponding feynman diagram , in both the renormalization and factorization scale . but defined in this way , @xmath6 suffers from infrared singularities .",
    "for example in ref.[32 ] , @xmath5 equals to @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the subprocess s mandelstam invariants . therefore , in the soft regions",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 , the integrals in ( 1.1 ) diverge and we need some regularization methods of @xmath13 in these regions for their calculation . in ref.[33 ] , the authors investigated the phenomenology of infrared renormalons in inclusive processes .",
    "the dispersive approach has been devised to extend properly modified perturbation theory calculations towards the low - energy region [ 34 ] .",
    "connections between power corrections for the three deep inelastic scattering sum rules have also been explored in ref.[35 ] .",
    "investigation of the infrared renormalon effects in various inclusive and exclusive processes is one of the most important and interesting problems in the perturbative qcd .",
    "it is known that infrared renormalons are responsible for factorial growth of coefficients in perturbative series for the physical quantities .",
    "but , these divergent series can be resummed by means of the borel transformation [ 1 ] and the principal value prescription [ 36 ] , and effects of infrared renormalons can be taken into account by a scale - setting procedure @xmath14 at the one - loop order results .",
    "technically , all - order resummation of infrared renormalons corresponds to the calculation of the one - loop feynman diagrams with the running coupling constant @xmath15 at the vertices or , alternatively , to calculation of the same diagrams with nonzero gluon mass .",
    "studies of infrared renormalon problems have also opened new prospects for evaluation of power - suppressed corrections to processes characteristics [ 37 ] .",
    "power corrections can also be obtained by means of the landau - pole free expression for the qcd coupling constant .",
    "the most simple and elaborated variant of the dispersive approach , the shirkov and solovtsov analytic perturbation theory , was formulated in ref.[38 ] .    by taking these points into account",
    ", it may be argued that the analysis of the next - to - leading order higher - twist effects on the dependence of the pion wave function in pion production at proton - proton collisions by the running coupling approach , are significant from both theoretical and experimental[39 ] points of view .    in this work",
    "we apply the running coupling approach[40 ] in order to compute the effects of the infrared renormalons on the meson production in proton - proton collisions in next - to - leading order .",
    "this approach was also employed previously[41,42 ] to calculate the inclusive meson production in proton - proton and photon - photon collisions . the running coupling method in next - to - leading order pion and kaon electromagnetic form factor was computed in [ 43 ] .    as we know ,",
    "power - suppressed contributions to exclusive processes in qcd , which are commonly referred to as higher - twist corrections .",
    "the higher - twist approximation describes the multiple scattering of a parton as power corrections to the leading - twist cross section .",
    "we will show that higher - twist terms contribute substantially to the inclusive meson cross section at moderate transverse momenta .",
    "in addition , we shall demonstrate that higher - twist reactions necessarily dominate in the kinematic limit where the transverse momentum approaches the phase - spase boundary .",
    "a precise measurement of the inclusive charged pion production cross section at @xmath16 and @xmath17 is important for the proton - proton collisions program at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at the brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "another important aspect of this study is the choice of the meson model wave functions . in this respect ,",
    "the contribution of the higher - twist feynman diagrams to a pion production cross section in proton - proton collisions is been computed by using various pion wave functions .",
    "also , higher - twist contributions which are calculated by the running coupling constant and frozen coupling constant approaches are been estimated and compared to each other . within this context",
    ", this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[ht ] , we provide formulas for the calculation of the contribution of the high twist diagrams . in sec .",
    "[ ir ] we present formulas and an analysis of the next - to - leading order higher - twist effects on the dependence of the pion wave function by the running coupling constant approach . in sec .",
    "[ lt ] , we provide formulas for the calculation of the contribution of the leading - twist diagrams . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we give the numerical results for the cross section and discuss the dependence of the cross section on the pion wave functions .",
    "we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "the higher - twist feynman diagrams , which describe the subprocess @xmath18 for the pion production in the proton - proton collision are shown in fig.1 . in the higher - twist diagrams , the pion of a proton quark is directly observed .",
    "their @xmath19 power suppression is caused by a hard gluon exchange between pion constituents .",
    "the amplitude for this subprocess can be found by means of the brodsky - lepage formula [ 27 ] :    @xmath20    in eq.(2.1 ) , @xmath21 is the sum of the graphs contributing to the hard - scattering part of the subprocess .",
    "the hard - scattering part for the subprocess under consideration is @xmath22 , where a quark and antiquark form a pseudoscalar , color - singlet state @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the pion wave function , i.e. , the probability amplitude for finding the valence @xmath25 fock state in the meson carry fractions @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 . remarkably , this factorization is gauge invariant and only requires that the momentum transfers in @xmath21 be large compared to the intrinsic mass scales of qcd . since the distribution amplitude and the hard - scattering amplitude are defined without reference to the perturbation theory , the factorization is valid to leading order in @xmath29 , independent of the convergence of perturbative expansions .",
    "the hard - scattering amplitude @xmath21 can be calculated in perturbation theory and represented as a series in the qcd running coupling constant @xmath30 .",
    "the function @xmath31 is intrinsically nonperturbative , but its evolution can be calculated perturbatively . in our calculation",
    ", we have neglected the pion and the proton masses . turning to extracting the contributions of the higher - twist subprocesses",
    ", there are many kinds of leading - twist subprocesses in @xmath32 collisions as the background of the higher - twist subprocess @xmath33 , such as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 etc .",
    "the contributions from these leading - twist subprocesses strongly depend on some phenomenological factors , for example , quark and gluon distribution functions in the proton and fragmentation functions of various constituents , etc .",
    "most of these factors have not been well determined , neither theoretically nor experimentally .",
    "thus they cause very large uncertainty in the computation of the cross section of process @xmath37 . in general ,",
    "the magnitude of this uncertainty is much larger than the sum of all the higher - twist contributions , so it is very difficult to extract the higher - twist contributions .",
    "the production of a hadron at large transverse momentum , @xmath0 , in a hadronic collisions is conventionally analyzed within the framework of perturbative qcd by convoluting the leading - twist @xmath38 hard subprocess cross sections with evolved structure and fragmentation functions .",
    "the most important discriminant of the twist of a perturbative qcd subprocess in a hard hadronic collision is the scaling of the inclusive invariant cross section [ 22 - 25,44 ] ,    @xmath39    at fixed @xmath40 and center - of - mass angle @xmath41 .",
    "as we know in the original parton model [ 45 ] the power fall - off is simply @xmath42 since the @xmath43 subprocess amplitude for point - like partons is scale invariant , and there is no dimensional parameter as in a conformal theory .",
    "the detected hadron @xmath44 can be produced directly in the hard subprocess reaction as in an exclusive reaction , then such direct higher - twist processes can give a significant contribution since there is no suppression from jet fragmentation at large momentum fraction carried by the hadron , @xmath45 , and the trigger hadron is produced without any waste of energy[44 ] .",
    "the mandelstam invariant variables for subprocesses @xmath18 are defined as @xmath46    in our calculation , we have also neglected the quark masses . we have aimed to calculate the pion production cross section and to fix the differences due to the use of various pion model functions . we have used five different wave functions : the asymptotic wave function ( asy ) , the chernyak - zhitnitsky wave function [ 28,46 ] , the cleo wave function [ 47 ] , the braun - filyanov pion wave functions [ 48 ] and the bakulev - mikhailov - stefanis pion wave function [ 49 ] .",
    "it should be noted that the wave functions of pions also are developed in refs.[50 - 52 ] by the dubna group :    @xmath47,\\ ] ] @xmath48,\\ ] ] @xmath49,\\ ] ] @xmath50,\\ ] ] @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the pion decay constant .",
    "here , we have denoted by @xmath55 , the longitudinal fractional momentum carried by the quark within the meson .",
    "then , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the pion wave function is symmetric under the replacement @xmath58 .",
    "several important nonperturbative tools have been developed which allow specific predictions for the hadronic wave functions directly from theory and experiments . the qcd sum - rule technique and lattice gauge theory",
    "provide constraints on the moments of the hadronic distribution amplitude .",
    "however , the correct pion wave function is still an open problem in qcd .",
    "it is known that the pion wave function can be expanded over the eigenfunctions of the one - loop brodsky - lepage equation , _",

    "this substitution calculation of integral ( 2.10 ) becomes easy .",
    "hence , the effective cross section obtained after substitution of the integral ( 2.10 ) into the expression ( 2.9 ) is referred as the frozen coupling effective cross section .",
    "we will denote the higher - twist cross section obtained using the frozen coupling constant approximation by @xmath96 .",
    "we have extracted the following higher - twist subprocesses contributing to the two covariant cross sections in eq.(2.11 ) @xmath97 by charge conjugation invariance , we also have @xmath98",
    "in this section , we shall calculate the integral ( 2.10 ) using the running coupling constant method and also discuss the problem of normalization of the higher - twist process cross section in the context of the same approach .    as is seen from ( 2.10 ) , in general , one has to take into account not only the dependence of @xmath99 on the scale @xmath100 , but also an evolution of @xmath101 with @xmath100 .",
    "the meson wave function evolves in accordance with a bethe - salpeter - type equation .",

    "in this section , we discuss the numerical results for next - to - leading order higher - twist effects with higher - twist contributions calculated in the context of the running coupling and frozen coupling approaches on the dependence of the chosen meson wave functions in the process @xmath205 . in the calculations , we use the asymptotic wave function @xmath206 , the chernyak - zhitnitsky @xmath207 , the cleo pion wave function [ 41 ] , the braun - filyanov pion wave functions [ 42 ] , and the bakulev - mikhailov - stefanis pion wave function [ 43 ] . for the higher - twist subprocess , we take @xmath208 and we have extracted the following four higher - twist subprocesses contributing to @xmath209 cross sections : @xmath210 @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 contributing to cross sections . for the dominant leading - twist subprocess for the pion production , we take the quark - antiquark annihilation @xmath188 , in which the @xmath189 meson is indirectly emitted from the gluon and quark - gluon fusion , @xmath214 , with subsequent fragmentation of the final quark into a meson , @xmath215 .",
    "as an example for the quark distribution function inside the proton , the mrst2003c package [ 56 ] has been used . the higher twist subprocesses probe the meson wave functions over a large range of @xmath61 squared momentum transfer , carried by the gluon .",
    "therefore , in the diagram given in fig.1 we take @xmath216 , @xmath103 , which we have obtained directly from the higher - twist subprocesses diagrams .",
    "the same @xmath61 has been used as an argument of @xmath30 in the calculation of each diagram .",
    "the results of our numerical calculations are plotted in figs.2 - 15 .",
    "first of all , it is very interesting to compare the resummed higher - twist cross sections with the ones obtained in the framework of the frozen coupling approach . in figs.2 - 4",
    "we show the dependence of next - to - leading order higher - twist cross sections @xmath217 calculated in the context of the running coupling constant approach and the ratios @xmath218/@xmath219 , @xmath217/@xmath220 as a function of the pion transverse momentum @xmath3 for different pion wave functions at @xmath221 .",
    "it is seen that the values of cross sections @xmath217 , and ratios for fixed @xmath222 and @xmath223 depend on the choice of the pion wave function .",
    "as seen from fig.2 the next - to - leading order higher - twist differential cross section is monotically decreasing with an increase in the transverse momentum of the pion . in figs.3 - 5",
    ", we show the dependence of the ratios @xmath218/@xmath219 , @xmath217/@xmath220 , @xmath217/@xmath224 as a function of the pion transverse momentum @xmath3 for different pion wave functions . here",

    "next - to - leading order higher - twist cross section calculated in the context of the running coupling method is suppressed by about 1 - 2 orders of magnitude relative to the leading - twist cross section , but in the region @xmath227 is comparable with the cross section of leading - twist . in figs.6 - 8 , we have depicted next - to - leading order higher - twist cross sections@xmath217 , ratios @xmath228 , @xmath229 as a function of the rapidity @xmath222 of the pion at @xmath16 and @xmath230 . at @xmath16 and @xmath230 ,",
    "the pion rapidity lies in the region @xmath231 .",

    "the next - to - leading order higher - twist cross section @xmath217 , is suppressed by about 1 - 2 order of magnitude relative to the leading - twist cross section . in the region ( @xmath233 )",
    ", the ratio for all wave functions increase with an increase of the @xmath222 rapidity of the pion and has a maximum approximately at the point @xmath234 .",
    "besides that , the ratio decreases with an increase in the @xmath222 rapidity of the pion . as is seen from figs.7 - 8 , the ratio @xmath235 very sensitive to the choice of the meson wave functions .",
    "but , as seen from fig.8 , the ratio @xmath217/@xmath224 for all wave functions has a minimum approximately at the point @xmath234 .",
    "also , the distinction between @xmath236 with @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 have been calculated .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath16 , @xmath221 , the distinction between @xmath236 with @xmath241(i = cleo , cz , bf , bms ) as a function of the pion transverse momentum @xmath3 is shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "thus , the distinction between @xmath236 and @xmath242 is maximum at @xmath243 , with @xmath244 at @xmath245 but the distinction between @xmath236 with @xmath246 is minimum at @xmath245 , with @xmath244 at @xmath243 and increase with an increase in @xmath0 .",
    "such a behavior of @xmath235 may be explained by reducing all moments of the pion model wave functions to those of @xmath159 for high @xmath61 .",
    "also , we have calculated the distinction between @xmath236 with @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 as a function of the rapidity @xmath222 of the pion .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath247 , @xmath248 the distinction between @xmath236 with @xmath241(i = cleo , cz , bf , bms ) as a function of the rapidity @xmath222 of the pion is presented in table [ table2 ] .",
    "we have also carried out comparative calculations in the center - of - mass energy @xmath17 .",
    "the results of our numerical calculations in the center - of - mass energies @xmath249 are plotted in figs.9 - 15 .",
    "analysis of our calculations at the center - of - mass energies @xmath16 and @xmath17 , show that with the increase in beam energy values of the cross sections , ratio @xmath250 , and contributions of next - to - leading order higher - twist to the cross section decrease by about 1 - 2 order .",
    "therefore the experimental investigation of higher - twist effects include renormalon effects conveniently in low energy .",
    "on the other hand , the higher - twist corrections and ratios @xmath235 a very sensitive to the choice of the pion wave function . analysis of our calculations at the center - of - mass energies @xmath16 and @xmath17 , show that values of the next - to - leading order cross sections decrease by about @xmath251 percent of magnitude relative to the leading - order cross sections .",
    "also , the distinction between @xmath236 with @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 have been calculated .",

    "thus , the distinction between @xmath236 with @xmath241,(i= cleo , bf , ) is maximum at @xmath252 , with @xmath244 at @xmath253 , but the distinction between @xmath236 with @xmath238 , @xmath237 , @xmath239 is minimum at @xmath253 , with @xmath244 at @xmath254 and increase with an increase in @xmath0 .",

    "meson appears in the range of @xmath259 .",
    "therefore , higher - twist cross section obtained in our paper should be observable at rhic",
    "in this work we have calculated the inclusive meson production via higher - twist mechanism and obtained the expressions for the subprocess @xmath260 cross section for mesons with symmetric wave functions . for calculation of the next - to - leading order cross section",
    "we have applied the running coupling constant method and revealed infrared renormalon poles in the cross section expression .",
    "infrared renormalon induced divergences have been regularized by the means of the principal value prescripton and the resummed expression ( the borel sum ) for the next - to - leading order higher - twist cross section has been found . in the resummed higher - twist cross section",
    "differs considerably from that found using the frozen coupling approach , some regions .",
    "also we have demonstrated that next - to - leading order higher - twist contributions to meson production cross section in the proton - proton collisions have important phenomenological consequences .",
    "our investigation enables us to conclude that the higher - twist pion production cross section in the proton - proton collisions depends on the form of the pion model wave functions and may be used for their study .",
    "analysis of our calculations shows that the magnitude of next - to - leading order cross sections calculated in the running coupling approach in some regions is larger than the leading - twist cross sections in 1 - 2 order .",
    "further investigations are needed in order to clarify the role of high twist effects in this process .",
    "we have demonstrated that the resummed result depends on the pion model wave functions used in calculations .",
    "the proton - proton collisions provide us with a new opportunity to probe a proton s internal structure .",
    "in particular , meson production in proton - proton collisions takes into account infrared renormalon effects : this opens a window toward new types of parton distributions which can not be measured by the deep inelastic lepton - proton scatterings . finally , we discuss the phenomenological consequences of possible higher - twist contributions to meson production in proton - proton collisions in next - to - leading order at rhic .",
    "future rhic measurements will provide further tests of the dynamics of large @xmath0 hadron production beyond leading twist .",
