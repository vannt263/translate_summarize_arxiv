    "however , a real planet will sometimes produce a dramatically time - variable infrared signal in response to several variables , as was recently demonstrated by @xcite . for planets on eccentric orbits",
    ", the observed signal will vary due to the star - planet distance , as well as rapid changes in our viewing angle to the planet .",
    "the latter is sensitive to the pseudo - synchronous rotation rate near periastron for planets on eccentric orbits .",
    "also , there is the finite radiative response time , wherein the planet s atmosphere does not heat or cool instantaneously in response to variable stellar irradiation .",
    "finally , a vigorous hydrodynamics is expected to re - distribute the heating by stellar irradiation .",
    "a full treatment of time - dependent radiative transfer coupled to nonlinear hydrodynamics is beyond the current state of the art . in this paper , we concentrate on the effect of time - dependent radiative transfer in isolation from the re - distribution of heat by dynamics .",
    "there are two motivations for investigating time - dependent radiative effects in relative isolation , coupled only to the changing rotational aspect geometry .",
    "first , we want to know the time scales for the exoplanet atmosphere to respond as a function of orbit eccentricity and depth in the atmosphere .",
    "second , a comparison of our calculations to _ spitzer _ time series data for eccentric planets might in principle inform us of the degree to which the observations are affected by dynamics , i.e. , can simple time - dependent radiative transfer and changing aspect geometry account for most of the observations , or do hydrodynamic effects become dominant on a short time - scale ? planets on eccentric orbits receive a highly varying flux from their stars . even in the case of one of the mildest eccentric planets wasp-10 b , with an eccentricity of 0.057",
    "@xcite this represents a variation @xmath0  25% in the received flux between periastron and apastron .",
    "our model takes into account the time - variable stellar irradiance impinging on the atmosphere of these planets .    in section  [ model ] , we present our time - dependent model calculation and assumptions . in section  [ planets ] , we will point out some aspects of the eccentric exoplanets .",
    "we will focus our study on the two transiting planets that have the largest eccentricities : hd  80606b ( @xmath1 ) and hd  17156b ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "a summary of the results and a conclusion will be presented in section  [ discuss ] .",

    "<S> we present a time - dependent radiative model for the atmosphere of extrasolar planets that takes into account the eccentricity of their orbit . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the modulation of stellar irradiation by the varying planet - star distance , the pseudo - synchronous rotation of the planets may play a significant role . </S>",
    "<S> we include both of these time - dependent effects when modeling the planetary thermal structure . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the thermal structure , and spectral characteristics for time - dependent stellar heating for two highly eccentric planets . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss observational aspects for those planets suitable for _ spitzer _ measurements , and investigate the role of the rotation rate . </S>"
