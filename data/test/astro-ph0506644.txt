    "the classical t  tauri star tw  hya , an apparently single star of mass 0.8  m@xmath3 , has become the focus of considerable attention because of its proximity ( 56 pc ) , and because it retains a remarkable face - on circumstellar disk of radius 225 au visible in scattered light @xcite and in thermal emission from dust and trace molecules @xcite .",
    "the dust in the tw  hya disk , like the dust in disks around many younger stars , has long been known to show evidence for size evolution from a primordial interstellar distribution . at optical and near - infrared wavelengths",
    ", the tw  hya disk appears almost spectrally gray @xcite , indicative of grain growth from sub - micron sizes in the upper layers of the disk . at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths ,",
    "the spectral slope indicates a shallow dependence of the particle mass opacity on wavelength , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 . for the tw  hya disk ,",
    "well resolved images of thermal dust emission confirm that optical depth effects do not affect the determination of the spectral slope @xcite . for compact spherical particles of size @xmath6 , @xmath7 , while for particles of size @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "in realistic astrophysical mixtures , @xmath10 also partly depends on grain composition , structure , and topology , though the particle size generally dominates , especially for common silicates @xcite .",
    "the shallow submillimeter spectral slope found for observations of tw  hya has been robustly interpreted as evidence for particle growth to sizes of order 1 millimeter or more @xcite .",
    "since the particle size probed by observation is comparable to wavelength , detection of dust emission at centimeter wavelengths has the potential to reveal the development and location of larger `` pebbles '' within disks .",
    "two problems have historically thwarted this goal @xcite : ( 1 ) the opacity per unit mass decreases for larger particles and the resulting emission is weak , and ( 2 ) the centimeter wavelength emission of younger ( @xmath11 myr old ) stars is often dominated by hot plasma in the system , either gyrosynchrotron emission associated with chromospheric activity , or thermal bremsstralung emission from partially ionized winds . for tw  hya ,",
    "the close distance and the advanced age mitigate these problems .",
    "we present new observations of tw  hya at centimeter wavelengths using the very large array ( vla ) that convincingly argue for emission from a population of large dust particles in the disk .",
    "we used the vla in late 2001 and early 2002 to observe tw  hya at @xmath12=3.5 cm at approximately bi - weekly intervals over 8 epochs in the d configuration ( 2001.732 , 2001.770 , 2001.808 , 2001.847 , 2001.885 , 2001.923 , 2001.956 , 2001.999 ) , which provided @xmath13 ( 450  au ) maximum resolution , and at 7 epochs in the a configuration ( 2002.047 , 2002.088 , 2002.140 , 2002.186 , 2002.252 , 2002.340 , 2002.381 ) , which provided considerably higher @xmath2 ( 15 au ) resolution .",
    "the typical rms noise in the images obtained from each of these short observations was @xmath14jy .",
    "in addition , we observed tw  hya at @xmath12=6  cm in the dnc configuration in 2001 september 24 , with beam size @xmath15 and rms noise 70 @xmath16jy , to provide supplemental spectral index information .",
    "the aips software was used for calibration and imaging of each vla data set following standard procedures .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the absolute flux scales at these wavelengths is less than 10% .",
    "a previous vla 3.5 cm @xmath17 upper limit of 84 @xmath16jy @xcite for tw  hya compared to a subsequent detection at @xmath18  @xmath16jy indicated that the emission at this wavelength was variable @xcite .",
    "this apparent variability , together with the discovery that tw  hya is a source of strong x - rays , suggested that the emission was due to hot gas resulting from stellar magnetic activity , which is known to produce variations at radio wavelengths of an order of magnitude or more on timescales of hours to months to years @xcite .",
    "our initial impetus to monitor the tw  hya 3.5  cm emission at frequent intervals was to investigate the variability , and to determine if the radio flux reached sufficient levels to be amenable to very long baseline interferometry .",
    "figure  [ fig : xband_time ] shows the tw  hya d configuration 3.5 cm measurements as a function of time .",
    "no variations from the 260 @xmath16jy mean were observed within the @xmath14jy rms uncertainties at each epoch . by contrast , a second radio source within the field of view with flux comparable to tw  hya , presumably a background active galactic nucleus , showed variations by more than a factor of two during this period .",
    "the surprising lack of variability for the tw  hya radio emission prompted us to check the previously reported upper limit .",
    "a re - analysis of these data from 1991 january 30 in the vla archive shows that the noise was significantly higher than reported , and excision of bad data results in a detection of tw  hya at the @xmath19jy level .",
    "the early observations that were thought to indicate variability in fact are compatible with all of the subsequent ( constant ) measurements .",
    "the a configuration 3.5 cm tw  hya observations spatially resolve the emission region . because the brightness distribution is strongly centrally peaked and falls off steeply with radius ,",
    "this is best illustrated by examination of the interferometer data in the visibility domain .",
    "figure  [ fig : xband_resolved ] shows the real part of the 3.5 cm visibility as a function of baseline length , annularly averaged in bins of 88 k@xmath12 width , combining data from all of the observed epochs to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the falloff in visibility at longer baselines is the signature that the emission is spatially resolved .",
    "the lack of time variability , together with spatial extent orders of magnitude larger than a stellar radius , provide strong constraints on the emission mechanism .",
    "in particular , chromospheric activity expected to arise from transient magnetic features comparable in extent to the star is not responsible for the 3.5  cm emission .",
    "more detailed x - ray data bolster this conclusion . observations of the x - ray spectrum with xmm - newton @xcite and chandra @xcite indicate electron densities two orders of magnitude higher than typically found in stellar coronae .",
    "in addition , the x - ray emitting material appears to be depleted of grain - forming elements like mg and si .",
    "the x - ray emission is more likely the result of accretion shocks at the star / disk interface .",
    "any radio emission from such accretion shocks would be on such small size scales that spatial extent would not be resolved by the vla observations .",
    "an ionized wind does not present a viable explanation for the 3.5 cm emission , either . while there is evidence for small amounts of ionized gas in the tw  hya system provided by optical spectroscopy of e.g. h@xmath20 emission @xcite , there are no indications from direct imaging of a wind in the form of an optical jet , as found in younger stars with higher disk accretion rates .",
    "a persuasive scaling argument against significant wind emission has been made previously from tw  hya s low inferred accretion rate of @xmath21  m@xmath3  yr@xmath22 , which suggests a low mass outflow rate , and therefore a 3.5 cm flux more than an order of magnitude lower than observed @xcite .",
    "the new vla observations provide two additional arguments against a wind origin for the emission .",
    "first , the @xmath17 upper limit at 6  cm constrains the spectral spectral index from 6 to 3.5 cm to be @xmath23 , which is incompatible with the nearly flat value of optically thin ionized gas , and steeper than typically found for the winds from young stars @xcite .",
    "second , and more important , the peak brightness temperature at 3.5 cm in the resolved data is only @xmath1  k , which is compatible with ionized gas only if the optical depth or filling factor of optically thick emission is very low , unlike any known ionized jet from a pre - main - sequence star .    dust emission naturally accounts for all of the properties of the 3.5 cm emission : ( 1 ) lack of time variability , ( 2 ) large spatial extent , ( 3 ) low brightness at high spatial resolution , and ( 4 ) the spectral index constraint .",
    "we conclude that the 3.5  cm emission from tw  hya is strongly dominated by thermal emission from dust particles in the disk surrounding the star .",
    "the full spectrum of tw  hya from the infrared through the millimeter , has been matched very well by a self - consistent irradiated accretion disk model that assumes standard optical properties for a mix of spherical particle constituents and a single - power power law size distribution @xcite .",
    "this model does not fit the observations at 3.5 cm , however .",
    "the dashed curve in figure  [ fig : twhya_spectrum ] shows that this previous model falls short of the observations at 3.5 cm by a factor of a few , which is much larger than the observational uncertainty .",
    "the basic reason is that many more grains that emit efficiently at centimeter wavelengths must be included in order to raise the level of dust emission at long wavelengths .",
    "a disk model that includes a plausible population of large grains can match the data . for illustration , we assume a simple model that contains two grain populations : ( 1 ) small grains with a size distribution ( as a function of particle radius @xmath24 ) @xmath25 between minimum and maximum sizes @xmath26 @xmath16 m and @xmath27 @xmath16 m , and ( 2 ) larger `` pebbles '' with size distribution @xmath28 , between minimum and maximum sizes @xmath29 mm and @xmath30 mm . the small grains , which contain only 0.1% of the particle mass in the disk , are needed to regulate the irradiated disk structure and to explain the infrared spectrum , including the silicate feature near 10  @xmath16 m @xcite .",
    "the solid curve in figure  [ fig : twhya_spectrum ] shows that the model with large grains boosts the long wavelength emission to match the observed flux density .",
    "the same model also matches very well the observed brightness distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : xband_resolved ] shows the fourier transform of the brightness distribution derived from this model as a solid curve , and the model follows the falloff in the visibilities .",
    "note that the large grains that account for the 3.5 cm emission must be present to radii of at least 10 s of au to match the observed brightness distribution .",
    "the disk mass in this model is 0.1  m@xmath3 , assuming a standard dust - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "this disk mass lies below the limit beyond which gravitational instabilities are expected to set in .",
    "the parameters in this simple model are clearly not unique . the strictly bimodal and discontinuous particle size distribution used in this disk model",
    "is meant to be illustrative of grain growth and settling , and to capture the essential behavior of more sophisticated treatments that result in small grains floating above a dense layer in the mid - plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the detailed situation is complex , with faster particle growth in the inner disk , and competition between growth , settling and turbulence , at all disk radii .",
    "the new observations , which show elevated emission from dust at 3.5  cm and a _ change _ in the spectral slope of the dust emission from submillimeter to centimeter wavelengths , are difficult to explain unless substantial particle evolution has occurred throughout the disk . future observations with higher signal - to - noise at high resolution hold the promise to map the spectral index of the dust emission in the disk and locate regions of changing grain properties .",
    "independent of the details of the disk model , the detection of dust emission at centimeter wavelengths provides a strong indications that an early phase of the planet building process is underway in the tw  hya disk .",
    "the inference of a @xmath31  au radius inner hole in dust disk from the mid - infrared spectral energy distribution has previously given rise to the suggestion that a planet may be present in the tw  hya system @xcite .",
    "in this context , it is interesting to consider that changes in dust properties may affect the timescale for planet formation .",
    "a key result in recent studies of giant planet formation by core accretion is the extraordinary sensitivity of the time of onset of a rapid gas accretion phase to assumptions of disk surface density and dust opacities ; for example , @xcite show that decreasing dust opacity can reduce the formation time of gas giant planets by more than a factor of two from the canonical 8  myr of older models @xcite .",
    "this shorter giant planet formation timescale is more comfortably consistent with estimates for the age of the tw  hya system .",
    "it would be extremely interesting if other classical t tauri stars showed invariate centimeter emission with spectral properties indicative of dust emission like tw hya .",
    "unfortunately , existing vla surveys of the large sample of sources associated with the most nearby dark clouds detect only younger class i objects or transition objects with high accretion rates that drive radio and optical jets , like hl tau and dg tau @xcite , and weak - lined t tauri stars with stellar activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for classical t tauri stars ,",
    "the upper limits at 6 cm are generally 160 - 300 @xmath16jy .",
    "a few sources have comparable or better limits at 3.5  cm , e.g. do tau @xmath32 @xmath16jy @xcite and dl tau and gg tau @xmath33 @xmath16jy @xcite . if tw hya were at 140  pc , then it would be among the stronger dust disks at millimeter wavelengths , but its 3.5 cm emission of only @xmath34  @xmath16jy would lie well below the existing detection limits for sources at that distance .",
    "more sensitive observations at a range of centimeter wavelengths are needed to determine what fraction , if any , of the disks around classical t tauri stars show evidence for extreme grain growth like that inferred for tw hya .",
    "the detection of dust emission at centimeter wavelengths from the tw  hya disk provides direct evidence for much larger particles than have been detected before in a nebula like the one from which the solar system is thought to have emerged .",
    "this first observation points the way to a new field of investigation .",
    "next generation radio telescopes , in particular the the square kilometer array @xcite , will have a combination of sensitivity and angular resolution sufficient to image in detail the distribution of large dust particles emitting at centimeter wavelengths in the disks around hundreds of young stars in nearby dark clouds and beyond ."
