    "the term riemann problem usually refers to an initial value formulation for a hyperbolic set of partial differential equations where initial data consist of two constant states separated by the discontinuity in the form of a plane surface .",
    "although more than 150 years have passed since the publication of riemann s original paper @xcite , the significance of the riemann problem in relativistic hydrodynamics has been truly recognized only recently ( see @xcite for an introduction ) .",
    "in this paper we are concerned with the general case of the riemann problem in relativistic hydrodynamics , where the fluid is allowed to move with the velocity tangent to the initial discontinuity . in newtonian hydrodynamics",
    "such solutions are not qualitatively different from those where the gas flows only in the direction normal to this surface . in the relativistic case , however , all velocities couple through lorentz factors , and the resulting wave pattern of the solution depends on the velocities tangent to the initial discontinuity .",
    "relativistic solutions of the riemann problem with non - vanishing tangential velocities were first obtained numerically by pons , mart and mller in 2000 for the perfect gas equation of state @xcite . some solutions for other equations of state",
    "were also computed in @xcite , and an analytic solution for the ultrarelativistic equation of state was presented by pitka and the author in @xcite .",
    "solutions of this type are usually used in order to construct and test three dimensional hydrodynamical codes . however in 2002 aloy and rezzolla discovered a hydrodynamical boosting mechanism accelerating gas in relativistic astrophysical jets to large lorentz factors @xcite .",
    "the analysis of this mechanism was based on solutions of the relativistic hydrodynamical riemann problem with non - zero velocities tangent to the initial discontinuity .",
    "it is thus clear that the role of this class of riemann problems is not restricted to numerical methods .",
    "this paper is devoted to three dimensional numerical studies of corrugation instabilities occurring in solutions of the riemann problem with non - zero tangent velocities both for ultrarelativistic and perfect gas equations of state .",
    "such instabilities , mainly of the kelvin  helmholtz type , were suggested e.g.  in @xcite . since solutions of",
    "the hydrodynamical riemann problem usually consist of different elementary waves : rarefaction and shock waves , a contact discontinuity and some constant states , the question of their stability is a little bit subtle .",
    "it makes sense to ask whether all parts of the solution become unstable or not .",
    "an instability of the region around a contact discontinuity does not have to imply that the surface of a shock wave present in the solution has to be unstable .",
    "also , when performing studies of the stability of solutions , one has to decide on a certain notion of stability , and the final answer may depend on this choice .",
    "we will address these issues in sec .",
    "v of this paper .",
    "we restrict ourselves to problems with moderately relativistic fluid velocities ( @xmath0 ) , and concentrate on solutions characterized by different wave patterns , i.e. , with two shock waves , two rarefaction waves or a shock and a rarefaction wave respectively .",
    "the question of stability of solutions with ultrarelativistic speeds is still open .",
    "there exist many numerical codes solving equations of relativistic hydrodynamics for the perfect gas equation of state , or for general equations of state where the pressure can be expressed in terms of the rest - mass density and the specific internal energy .",
    "the case with ultrarelativistic equation of state is different in this respect ; it basically requires a new formulation of the numerical scheme .",
    "such a numerical code has been written for the purpose of this work and will also be described here .",
    "the order of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we collect all basic equations necessary to explain our approach .",
    "iii discusses the structure of exact solutions of the riemann problem in relativistic hydrodynamics . in sec .",
    "iv we describe new elements of numerical methods used in this paper .",
    "v contains numerical results on the stability of the riemann problem in relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "a short summary can be found in sec .",
    "conservation of the energy and the momentum in relativistic hydrodynamics can be expressed as @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the pressure , @xmath5 the energy density , @xmath6 denote components of the four - velocity of the fluid , and @xmath7 are the components of the minkowski metric . in the above formulae greek indices range from 0 to 3 and the convention with @xmath8 is assumed .",
    "if the equation of state is in the barotropic form @xmath9 , the above equations constitute a complete set of equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "the ultrarelativistic equation of state of the form @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being a constant ( the local speed of sound ) is a good example here .",
    "more generally one introduces the rest - mass density @xmath12 , so that the continuity equation @xmath13 is satisfied , and the equation of state is expressed in terms of the rest - mass density @xmath12 and the specific internal energy @xmath14 , defined as @xmath15 .",
    "this is the case of the perfect gas equation of state : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a constant .",
    "in such a case the complete set of equations of hydrodynamics consists of four eqs .",
    "( [ energy_momentum_cons ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ rest_mass_cons ] ) .    for the purpose of evolutionary problems , it is convenient to rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ energy_momentum_cons ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ rest_mass_cons ] ) in the form , where the derivatives with respect to time and space are separated explicitly .",
    "we introduce the lorentz factor @xmath18 and components of the three - velocity @xmath19 .",
    "( [ energy_momentum_cons ] ) can be now written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 denotes the kronecker s delta .",
    "the set of eqs .",
    "( [ energy_momentum_cons ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ rest_mass_cons ] ) can be also expressed in the form of eq .",
    "( [ u_and_f ] ) . to this end , it is customary to introduce the specific enthalpy @xmath24 .",
    "vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 must be now 5-dimensional , namely @xmath27 and @xmath28    in this paper we will refer to eqs .",
    "( [ u_and_f ] ) with @xmath25 and @xmath26 given by ( [ u_ultra ] ) and ( [ f_ultra ] ) and the ultra - relativistic equation of state as to system i. eqs .",
    "( [ u_and_f ] ) with @xmath25 and @xmath26 defined as in ( [ u_perfect ] ) and ( [ f_perfect ] ) and the perfect gas equation of state will be called system ii .",
    "solutions of the riemann problem for system i were obtained by smoller and temple for the case without velocities tangent to the initial discontinuity in @xcite .",
    "solutions valid for arbitrary velocities ( also tangent to the discontinuity ) were presented by pitka and the author in @xcite .",
    "analogous solutions for system ii were first calculated by mart and mller for the case without tangential velocities @xcite and promoted later to the case with non - zero tangential velocities by pons , mart and mller in @xcite .    in order to describe these solutions briefly , we will introduce cartesian coordinates @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and assume that the initial discontinuity , dividing two initial states @xmath32 and @xmath33 , is a plane given by @xmath34 . here",
    ", traditionally , @xmath32 refers to the `` left '' state , i.e. , for @xmath35 ; @xmath33 refers to the``right '' one , that is for @xmath36 . in this case solutions of the riemann problem",
    "are self - similar : they depend on @xmath29 and time @xmath37 through a single variable @xmath38 , and they are independent of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    in all cases solutions can be constructed from self - similar elementary waves : a smooth part ",
    "the so - called rarefaction wave @xmath39 and two possible discontinuities , i.e. , a shock wave @xmath40 and the contact discontinuity @xmath41 .",
    "all three kinds of elementary waves can be separated by some constant intermediate states @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that the initial state @xmath44 decays into one of the following possible wave patterns : @xmath45 where the arrows refer to the direction in which the waves move with respect to each other ( it is customary to refer to these waves as to left and right - moving ) . by the contact discontinuity",
    "we understand a surface across which the pressure and the normal component of the velocity are continuous , while other quantities , like tangent components of the velocity or , in case of system ii , the rest - mass density and the specific internal energy , can exhibit a jump .",
    "accordingly , the pressure @xmath4 and @xmath29 components of the velocity @xmath46 have to be equal in both intermediate states @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "since it is possible to compute the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath46 behind the left and right moving waves ( either a shock or a rarefaction wave ) in terms of the state in front of the wave ( @xmath32 or @xmath33 depending on the direction of propagation of the wave ) , we can compute the values of @xmath4 and @xmath46 in both intermediate states from the condition that these values have to be the same for both right and left moving waves .",
    "this calculation identifies the particular type of both waves .",
    "next , it is possible to compute the speeds of propagation of discontinuities and of the front and the tail of the rarefaction wave ( if present ) . at this stage",
    "computing all other details of the solution is straightforward .",
    "a precise description of this procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "the code used to investigate the instabilities occurring in the solutions of the riemann problem is based on a godunov type , high resolution shock capturing scheme ( for a textbook exposition see @xcite ) .",
    "the construction of the code is similar to that described in @xcite , and a preliminary version has been presented in @xcite .    the temporal evolution of conserved quantities is implemented according to a variant of method of lines .",
    "the space is discretised into cells ( zones ) labeled by indices @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 in cartesian directions @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively . in the following @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 will denote coordinates of the center of the zone labeled by @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "dimensions of the zone will be given by @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "positions of the interfaces between zones will be denoted in the usual fashion , where symbol @xmath56 refers to the @xmath29 coordinate of the interface between zones labeled by @xmath47 and @xmath57 , and positions of the interfaces in directions @xmath30 and @xmath31 are denoted in the analogous way .",
    "the time derivative of cell - averaged values of @xmath25 is computed according to the following formula @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote numerical fluxes defined at the interfaces between adjacent cells .",
    "values of @xmath65 are advanced in time using the standard fourth or second order runge ",
    "kutta method , i.e. , either as @xmath66 where @xmath67 or according to @xmath68 here the upper index @xmath12 numbers subsequent time steps of size @xmath69 .    clearly , the key problem is to compute the values of numerical fluxes @xmath70 . in @xcite",
    "we have presented preliminary tests obtained by using relativistic harten , van leer , lax , einfeldt ( hlle ) formulae for system i ( for the description of the hlle solver see @xcite ) . here",
    "we go a little bit further and employ a modified version of a flux formula introduced originally by donat and marquina @xcite and used in @xcite .",
    "suppose we want to compute a numerical flux at the interface between two riemann states @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 be the eigenvalues , left eigenvectors and right eigenvectors of the jacobian @xmath76 respectively .",
    "moreover , subscripts @xmath32 and @xmath33 will refer to the values obtained for the left and right states @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "numerical fluxes @xmath77 are computed as @xmath78    the values of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 should be computed analytically .",
    "they are given in @xcite for system ii , and have to be computed separately for system i. it can be noted , however , that the precise knowledge of all these terms is not necessary .",
    "the only required quantities are the eigenvalues @xmath73 and all vectors @xmath79 .    in general ,",
    "for a barotropic fluid with @xmath9 and @xmath80 the eigenvalues of @xmath76 are @xmath81 @xmath82 the eigenvalue @xmath83 is twofold degenerate .",
    "the expression for @xmath84 can be also written as @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "if @xmath87 is the only component of the velocity then @xmath88 .",
    "the remaining formulae will be given for @xmath89 .",
    "expressions for @xmath90 and @xmath91 can be easily obtained from the symmetry .",
    "( there is also no reason to treat jacobians @xmath92 separately in the code .",
    "it is enough to implement formulae for @xmath93 ; other fluxes can be computed by swapping the order of velocities and conserved momenta . )",
    "let us introduce the square of the tangential velocity @xmath94 , and define a bunch of auxiliary quantities : @xmath95 in these terms @xmath96 and @xmath97    systems i and ii differ also in the numerical procedure used to recover primitive hydrodynamical quantities like @xmath12 , @xmath4 , @xmath87 from the conserved ones .",
    "for the perfect gas equation of state such a recovery is performed by means of a newton  raphson scheme .",
    "for the ultrarelativistic equation of state primitive values can obtained from @xmath98 analytically .",
    "the last , key ingredient of the code is the reconstruction procedure used to obtain the states @xmath71 and @xmath72 based on the values of @xmath25 from the neighboring zones . for the results presented here we have used the convex essentially non oscillatory ( ceno ) reconstruction procedure presented in @xcite and applied to the relativistic hydrodynamics by @xcite",
    ".    the general rules of the method can be found in @xcite",
    ". here we will only give final formulae .",

    "let us define @xmath101 @xmath102 and @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 denotes the minmod function , i.e. , @xmath107 next , we introduce a linear function @xmath108 and three quadratic polynomials @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",

    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 flows with some nonzero tangent velocity @xmath161 , different at both sides of the contact discontinuity . we have checked that in the absence of the tangent velocity no instability around the contact discontinuity develops .",
    "the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz character of the instability can be seen on fig .",
    "[ prob_f_2d ] , presenting once again the evolution of problem ( f ) . here , we have decided to show the distribution of the rest - mass density @xmath12 on two dimensional @xmath139 cross sections through the grid . in this case",
    "the two intermediate states @xmath42 and @xmath43 have different densities and we can observe a standard kelvin ",
    "helmholtz wave picture .",
    "the tubes of lower density can be identified with regions trapped under crests of the waves .    in the same fashion fig .",
    "[ vely_f_2d ] shows the two dimensional plots of the @xmath161 component of the velocity for problem ( f ) , i.e. , for the same data as those presented on fig .",

    "[ normsa][norms_inf2 ] show the time evolution of norms ( [ norms ] ) for solutions ( a)(f ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath157 and @xmath158 norms for those problems is depicted on figs .",
    "[ normsa][normsf ] . in both norms",
    "there is a short phase of a rapid growth of the perturbation followed by either a decrease of its size ( @xmath158 norm ) or a very slow growth ( @xmath157 norm ) . for completeness @xmath159 norms for problems ( a)(f )",
    "are shown on figs .",
    "[ norms_inf ] and [ norms_inf2 ] .",
    "also this norm increases at early stages of evolution , and starts to oscillate around some constant value for later times .",
    "judging from those results , one can say that the fast exponential growth of instabilities , usually obtained in a linearized calculation for the non relativistic kelvin  helmholtz instability , is only limited to a very short early phase of evolution .",
    "later , nonlinear effects become dominant , and the growth of perturbations is stalled .",
    "we have performed a series of three dimensional numerical studies of the corrugation stability of the riemann problem in relativistic hydrodynamics with non - zero velocities tangent to the surface of the initial discontinuity .",
    "we specialized to two equations of state : the ultrarelativistic one and that of perfect gas . in both cases",
    "a modern high resolution shock capturing godunov type numerical scheme was employed .",
    "the conserved hydrodynamical quantities were evolved in time within the framework of method of lines , using a standard fourth order runge  kutta algorithm .",
    "numerical fluxes were based on the work of donat and marquina @xcite .",
    "the required spectral decomposition of the jacobians appearing in the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics was taken from @xcite for the perfect gas equation of state ; it was computed separately for the general barotropic case ( ultrarelativistic equation of state , in particular ) , and the results are presented in this paper .",
    "the ceno reconstruction procedure was adapted from @xcite .",
    "we have focused on mildly relativistic solutions resulting with different possible wave patterns , i.e. , solutions with two shock waves , two rarefaction waves , or a combination of a shock wave and a rarefaction wave . in all cases",
    "both rarefaction and shock waves behaved in a stable way in the sense that their shapes were becoming flattened with time .",
    "helmholtz type instabilities were observed to develop only around the contact discontinuity , forming a turbulent region with characteristic rarefaction `` tubes '' .",
    "this behavior is essentially the same for the perfect gas equation of state and for the ultrarelativistic one .",
    "slightly more turbulent instabilities develop in the case of perfect gas equation of state , what can be observed both on the three dimensional plots of solutions and in the evolution of norms measuring the size of the perturbation .",
    "the behavior of perturbed solutions with ultrarelativistic velocities tangent to the initial discontinuity remains an open question .",
    "we believe that these results can be helpful in understanding more complex phenomena occurring , for instance , during propagation of relativistic astrophysical jets .",
    "the evolution of the so - called turbulent cocoon @xcite could be compared with our results concerning the riemann problem alone . since the behavior of turbulent flows depends on dimensionality , and in particular it is different in two and three spatial dimensions , a fair comparison would require three dimensional simulations of jets ( see @xcite for an example )",
    ".    solutions of the relativistic riemann problems are also applied in the modelling of heavy ion collisions during the so - called hydrodynamical phase ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our results should be of interest here .",
