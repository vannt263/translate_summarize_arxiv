    "trapped ultra - cold atoms have become model systems of choice for simulating physical effects from condensed matter  @xcite to cosmology  @xcite . the recently achieved ability to create synthetic vector potentials  @xcite acting on neutral atoms",
    "has increased the versatility of the atomic - physics simulation toolkit even further .",
    "it is now possible to simulate magnetic fields by inducing spatially varying @xmath0 ( i.e. , scalar ) gauge potentials  @xcite , and pseudo - spin splittings can be created in spinor gases  @xcite using spatially constant vector potentials having a ( possibly non - abelian ) matrix structure .",
    "these advances have stimulated a host of theoretical works studying , e.g. , the effect of uniform @xmath1 gauge potentials on the behavior of quantum particles subject to uniform ordinary magnetic fields  @xcite , or proposing the use of staggered effective spin - dependent magnetic fields in optical lattices  @xcite to simulate a new class of materials called topological insulators  @xcite that exhibit the quantum spin hall effect  @xcite . very recently , the non - quantized intrinsic spin hall effect  @xcite has been realized experimentally in a quantum gas  @xcite , and the authors of this paper outline the way forward to reaching conditions where the quantum spin hall effect could be observed .",
    "furthermore , newly demonstrated methods to simulate strong - enough magnetic fields to probe ultra - cold atom gases in the ordinary quantum - hall regime  @xcite are expected to be adaptable for the purpose of generating spin - dependent quantizing magnetic fields  @xcite , which opens up another avenue towards the exploration of quantum - spin - hall physics .",
    "part of the motivation for our present theoretical work arises from these rapid developments of experimental capabilities .",
    "the ordinary quantum hall ( qh ) effect  @xcite occurs because particles confined to move in two spatial dimensions and subject to a strong perpendicular magnetic field develop incompressibilities at integer , and certain fractional , values of the landau - level filling factor  @xcite .",
    "while the landau quantization of single - particle energies is the origin of the integer qh effect , incompressibility at fractional filling factors is caused by the discrete spectrum of interaction energies for two particles occupying states from the same landau level  @xcite . in the conceptually simplest realization of the quantum _",
    "spin _ hall ( qsh ) effect  @xcite , particles exhibit an integer qh effect due to a spin - dependent perpendicular magnetic field that points in opposite directions for the two opposite - spin components .",
    "it seems then quite straightforward to conjecture  @xcite that a fractional version of the qsh effect should exist that mirrors features of the ordinary fractional qh effect in multi - component systems  @xcite . following this line of thought ,",
    "some previous discussions of a putative fractional qsh physics  @xcite have been based on an _ ad hoc _ adaptation of trial wave functions first proposed in ref .",
    "however , unless only particles with the same spin interact , such an approach is fraught with difficulty  @xcite .",
    "here we revisit the question of how a fractional qsh effect can arise in an interacting ( pseudo-)spin-1/2 system that experiences a spin - dependent quantizing magnetic field .",
    "in particular , we elucidate the effect of interactions between particles having opposite spin .",
    "we find that such inter - species interactions significantly alter the expected qsh physics , but they also open up new opportunities for tailoring the properties of quantum many - particle states .",
    "our study is complementary to recent investigations of fractional qsh phases  @xcite that arise in materials with exotic topological band structures  @xcite or strained graphene  @xcite .",
