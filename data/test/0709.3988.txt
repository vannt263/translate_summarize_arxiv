    "modern cosmology faces two outstanding challenges , namely the existence and nature of dark energy and dark matter .",
    "many theories have been put forward to address both issues : for dark matter , several candidates are available , such as weak - interacting particles ( wimps ) arising from extensions to the standard model ( _ e.g. _ axions , neutralinos ) , _ etc . _ ; for dark energy , `` quintessence '' models consider the slow - roll of a scalar field @xcite , amongst other candidates ; others suggest that the averaging of inhomogeneities at a cosmological scale may yield an effective scalar field , thus accounting for the dark energy component of the universe @xcite .",
    "a possible unification of both `` dark '' components has also been suggested , resorting to a scalar field model @xcite or an exotic equation of state , as featured by the so - called modified chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "a different approach assumes that no extra energy content is needed and that the fundamental laws and tenets of gravitation may be incomplete , perhaps just a low - energy approximation ; as a consequence , modifications of the friedmann equation to include higher order terms in the energy density @xmath0 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) have been proposed or , at a more fundamental level , changes to the action functional .",
    "a rather straight forward approach lies in replacing the linear scalar curvature term in the einstein - hilbert action by a function of the scalar curvature , @xmath1 ; alternatively , one could resort to other scalar invariants of the theory @xcite .",
    "this has led to some success in replicating the accelerated expansion of the universe , while comparison with its evolution throughout the different ages has yielded some constraints and exclusions to the form of @xmath1 ; perhaps the most well - known proposal of this type is the starobinsky inflationary model , where a quadratic term in the curvature is added to the usual linear form ( plus cosmological constant ) , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "solar system tests could also bring further insight , mostly arising from the parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) metric coefficients derived from this extension of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "however , some disagreement exists in the community , with some arguing that no changes are predicted at a post - newtonian level ( see _ e_.g . @xcite and references therein ) ; amongst other considerations , this mostly stems from an approach based either in the more usual metric affine connection ( that is , where the affine connection is taken _ a priori _ as depending on the metric ) , or in the so - called palatini approach @xcite ( where both the metric and the affine connection are taken as independent variables ) . as an example of a clear phenomenological consequence of this extension of gr , it has been shown that @xmath3 theories yield a gravitational potential which displays an increasing , repulsive contribution , added to the newtonian term @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding the significant literature on these @xmath1 models , few steps have been taken to address another interesting possibility : not only that the curvature is non - trivial in the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , but also that the coupling between matter and geometry is not minimum ; indeed , these are only implicitly related in the action functional , since one expects that covariantly invariant terms in @xmath4 should be constructed by contraction with the metric ( _ e.g. _ the kinetic term of a real scalar field , @xmath5 ) .",
    "a non - minimum coupling would imply that geometric quantities ( such as the scalar invariants ) would explicitly show in the action ; asides from theoretical elegance , this could have deep phenomenological implications : indeed , in regions where the curvature is high ( which , in gr , are related to regions of high energy density or pressure ) , the implications of such theory could deviate considerably from those predicted by einstein s theory @xcite .",
    "related proposals have been put forward previously to address the problem of the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite and the existence of a cosmological constant @xcite .    in this sense ,",
    "the immediate question , posed in the title of this work , is : what are the implications for the behaviour of matter under such conditions ?",
    "some work has been put forward concerning this issue , namely changes to geodetic behaviour @xcite , the possibility of modelling dark matter @xcite and the violation of the highly constrained equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most important consequence of the mentioned studies is that energy may no longer be covariantly conserved , that is , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter ; this occurs because , due to the presence of extra terms in the equations of motion , the bianchi identities no longer imply in the covariant conservation of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this work addresses what we believe is the natural proving ground for a non - minimally coupled gravity model : regions where the density may be high enough , to evidence some deviation from gr , although moderate enough so that effects are still perturbative  a star .",
    "the results rely upon and expand the methodology followed by the authors in previous studies @xcite .",
    "this paper is divided in the following sections : first , we present the model upon which the subsequent work is based ; then , we develop the equations of motion , aiming at the modified tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation , with due care taken regarding the validity of the newtonian regime and resulting modified hydrostatic equilibrium equation ; afterwards , we insert the polytropic equation of state into the latter , and compute the necessary observables ; a numerical session follows , where profiles and bounds are computed for the relevant quantities ; finally , a discussion of our results is presented .",
    "following the discussion of the previous section , one postulates the following action for the theory @xcite ,    s = d^4 x [ action ]    where @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) are arbitrary functions of the scalar curvature @xmath10 , @xmath4 is the lagrangian density of matter and @xmath11 is the metric determinant . for convenience",
    ", the contribution of the non - minimum coupling of @xmath12 is gauged through the coupling constant @xmath13 ( which has dimensions @xmath14 = [ f_2]^{-1}$ ] ) .",
    "the standard einstein - hilbert action is recovered by taking @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the cosmological constant ( from now on , one works in a unit system where @xmath19 ) .",

    "( [ ee ] ) , it is clear that a full treatment of the equations of motion is unattainable unless some specific form for @xmath26 and @xmath27 is provided .",
    "furthermore , the presence of both the pure curvature and non - minimum coupling , respectively , still constitutes a daunting analytical challenge ; hence , and since one is mainly interested in the relevance of the effects within a high curvature and pressure medium , where @xmath12 should overwhelm the modification of the pure curvature term , @xmath28 ( neglecting the contribution of the cosmological constant ) , it appears sensible to discard the latter ; a treatment of the standard @xmath1 scenario with @xmath15 may be found in ref .",

    "hence , one can not extend the perturbational approach to the full range of the star , and should instead deal with the full differential equation for the perturbed @xmath132 .    in order to circumvent this issue ,",
    "recall that there is a pronounced deviation between the predictions of the polytropic model and the realistic standard solar model , for @xmath165 ; this reflects the crossing from the radiative zone , where the @xmath128 polytrope is a good approximation for the sun , and the convection zone , where this approach fails .",
