    "during the past several years considerable interest has been shown in exploring localized nonlinear waves in the variable coefficient nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation and its generalizations @xcite .",
    "the motivation comes from the fact that nls equation and its variants appear in several branches / topics of physics , including nonlinear optics @xcite and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , etc . focusing our attention on becs alone",
    ", it is well known that the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation governs the evolution of macroscopic wave function at ultra low temperatures @xcite . in particular , for cigar shaped becs , it has been shown that the gp equation can be reduced to the 1d variable coefficient nls equation @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the condensate wave function , @xmath2 is the dimensionless normalized time , @xmath3 is the dimensionless normalized coordinate in the axial direction , @xmath4 represents the effective scattering length and @xmath5 is the axial trap frequency .",
    "a simple and straightforward way of exploring the localized / periodic structures of ( [ eq:1d - gp ] ) is by transforming it into a constant coefficient nls equation through a suitable transformation . from the known solutions of the latter equation",
    "the solutions of the former equation can be identified . using this procedure a class of solutions , in particular various localized solutions , have been identified for the model ( [ eq:1d - gp ] ) , including soliton , breather , and rogue wave ( rw ) solutions . in order to appreciate the relevance of the above type of localized structures for eq .",

    "the intensity profile of the soliton is shown in fig . [ figa](a ) .",
    "the typical form of the envelope soliton is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a complex constant , @xmath9/2+\\eta_{1i}^{(0)}$ ] and @xmath10 . here",

    "this solution is also called a general breather ( gb ) since it is periodic both in space and in time .",
    "two important special cases are the following : ( i ) when @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the gb solution corresponds to an akhmediev breather ( ab ) which is periodic in space and localized in time .",
    "( ii ) if we take @xmath29 and @xmath30 , ( [ nls2 ] ) becomes a ma breather ( mb ) which is periodic in time only and localized in space .",

    "( [ nls2 ] ) reduces to the following form , @xmath37 very often the above localized nonlinear wave is described as a wave that  appears from nowhere and disappears without a trace \" @xcite as shown in fig . [ figa](c ) .",
    "it was first observed in the area of oceanography @xcite and is traditionally defined as a wave whose wave - height ( the distance from trough to crest ) is more than twice the significant wave height ( swh ) . the latter is generally defined as the average wave height among one third of highest waves in a given time series @xcite .",
    "further , it has also been explained that the above structure ( [ nls3 ] ) arises due to a modulation instability ( mi ) @xcite of the plane wave solution of the constant coefficient nls equation .",
    "very recently higher - order rws ( hrws ) which correspond to the higher - order rational solutions of the nls equation ( [ nls ] ) have been deduced @xcite .",
    "the explicit expressions for the second and third - order rws of the nls equation are given in appendix a. these hrws have higher amplitudes than the first - order rw .",
    "the rws have also been observed experimentally in physical systems such as water wave tank @xcite , capillary waves @xcite and nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "several theoretical studies on the dynamics of rws in nonlinear fiber optics @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , laser - plasma interactions @xcite , and even econophysics @xcite , described by scalar nls equation , have been made in recent times .",
    "now , as mentioned in the beginning , the dynamics of a cigar shaped bec at absolute zero temperature is usually described by the mean - field gp equation ( [ eq:1d - gp ] ) , which is a generalized form of the ubiquitous constant coefficient nls equation ( [ nls ] ) , for the wave function of the condensate . since the nls equation ( [ nls ] )",
    "admits breather and rw solutions , it is natural to expect that rws and breathers may also be found in bec systems as well . in this context",
    ", the rws can correspond to a sudden increase of peaks in the condensate clouds similar to the nature of high peaks in the open sea , while breathers are generalizations of the rws .",
    "the formative mechanism for the matter rws in becs is the accumulation of energy and atoms towards its central part and their spreading out to a constant density background .",
    "the formation of matter breather is the periodic exchange of atoms between the profile and the plane wave background . from an experimental point of view",
    ", the existence of rw and breather structures in a bec system can be effectively controlled by tuning the nonlinear interaction between atoms by feshbach resonance technique @xcite and modulating the trapping frequency of the external potential .",
    "it will therefore be of great interest to study the characteristics and/or controlling of structures of rws and breathers due to their localization both in space and in time in bec experiments .",
    "past explorations of gp equation in becs have paved the way for important developments in manipulating coherent matter waves for application , including atom interferometry @xcite , coherent atom transport @xcite and quantum information processing or quantum computation @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of high significance to study the dynamics of rws and breather profiles of the gp equation ( [ eq:1d - gp ] ) .",
    "however only few attempts have been made to identify and analyze the rws and breather solutions of ( [ eq:1d - gp ] ) @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "neither higher - order rw solutions ( with certain free parameters ) nor higher order breather solutions of ( [ eq:1d - gp ] ) have been taken up for study .",
    "motivated by these observations , in this work , we construct the aforementioned localized and periodic solutions of ( [ eq:1d - gp ] ) . besides constructing these two families of solutions",
    "we also investigate how to manipulate the rws and breathers through the effective scattering length and the strength of trap parameter .",
    "having stated the motivation we now proceed to construct a transformation that transforms eq .",

    "we consider each one of the cases separately and substitute them in ( [ a7 ] ) along with the rw and breather solutions of ( [ nls ] ) .",
    "we then analyze in detail how the nature of the rw and breather structures get modified by the above two functions @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "our analysis shows that the amplitude parameter @xmath52 plays a vital role in the formation of rw , and the trap frequency and the effective scattering length modify the structure of the rw and breather profiles , allowing one the possibility of manipulating the rws and breathers in specific ways .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we construct rw solutions for time - independent and time - dependent traps and study their characteristics in detail . to the best of our knowledge , for the first time in the literature , we observe that the second- and third - order rws transform to first - order rw - like structures when we tune a parameter which appears in the harmonic traps ( time - independent and time - dependent traps ) . in sec .",
    "iii , we also construct rw solutions with free parameters which allow us to split the symmetric form solution into a multi - peaked solution for ( [ eq:1d - gp ] ) and investigate how these rw structures get modified in the plane wave background by increasing the strength of the trap . in sec .",

    "v , we present a summary of the results and our conclusions .",
    "to begin with , we consider the case in which the trap frequency is a constant , that is @xmath42 = constant = @xmath53 .",
    "a time - independent trap frequency implies that the frequency does not change with time and space .",
    "we then consider the trap frequency to be time - dependent and investigate the associated rw solutions .",
