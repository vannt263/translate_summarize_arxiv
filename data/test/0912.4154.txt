    "a lattice vacancy can be described by a very large on - site energy in the tight - binding model @xcite . due to the translational invariance of a perfect agnr in the @xmath11 axis , we only have to consider the effect of position of the vacancy along the @xmath12 axis . here",

    "it is this non - bonding state that gives rise to the zero conductance at @xmath20 , as shown in fig .",
    "when the energy deviates from zero , ldos on a sublattice becomes finite , which opens possible hopping paths for electrons to cross the vacancy region , and thus provides finite conductance .",

    "the wave functions at the three nearest neighbors of the atom @xmath7 should satisfy the relation@xmath31 at zero energy , this implies @xmath32        without lost of generality , we take agnr with width @xmath13 with a vacancy on the b sublattice , as shown by fig .",

    "we can immediately get @xmath34 . then from @xmath35 , due to the node of wave function of agnr , and @xmath34 , we can deduce @xmath36 . in a similar way we can show that all the atoms of sublattice b have zero ldos .",
    "it is easy to see that the same discussion applies for the vacancy at any positions of @xmath37 of the agnr .",
    "the appearance of such non - bonding state is closely related with the topological structure of graphene .",
    "a single vacancy can not induce such non - bonding state for the square lattice , as shown by fig .",

    "we have also investigated zb s with different heights ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 for gnc with wider agnr @xmath53 ) and found that a zb with three successive sites in a sequence is enough to induce localized edge state , consistent with previous works @xcite .",
    "the localized edge state is suppressed by the introduction of a single vacancy at the zb b1 and b2 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ g7](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "next we study how the localized edge states affect the transport behaviors by comparing the conductance spectrums of the three gncs shown in fig .  g7 . as shown in figs .",

    "therefore , the localized state at the zb is responsible for the suppression of conductance to zero at @xmath20 .",
