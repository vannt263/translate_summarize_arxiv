    "perovskite materials are of considerable interest both for fundamental reasons and for their many actual and potential technological applications .",
    "the great fascination of the cubic perovskite structure is that it can readily display a variety of structural phase transitions , ranging from non - polar antiferrodistortive ( afd ) to ferroelectric ( fe ) and antiferroelectric ( afe ) in nature.@xcite the competition between these different instabilities evidently plays itself out in a variety of ways , depending on the chemical species involved , leading to the unusual variety and richness of the observed structural phase diagrams . for example , as temperature is reduced , batio@xmath0 undergoes a series of fe phase transitions , while srtio@xmath0 has a single afd transition .",
    "more extreme examples are nanbo@xmath0 and bazro@xmath0 ; the former has a series of six transitions , while the latter stays cubic down to zero temperature .",
    "another appealing property of these cubic perovskites is that all of the structural phase transitions involve only small distortions from the ideal cubic structure , the typical distortion being less than 5% of the lattice constant .",
    "this simplifies the theoretical treatment considerably .",
    "the ample experimental data on these compounds also provide many insights and opportunities for checking the accuracy of theoretical calculations .",
    "it is no wonder that there have been many theoretical attempts to study these compounds .",
    "previous phenomenological model hamiltonian approaches@xcite have largely been limited by oversimplification and ambiguities in interpretation of experiment , while empirical @xcite and non - empirical pair - potential methods @xcite have not offered high enough accuracy .",
    "recently , advances in density - functional techniques have made possible first - principles investigations of such perovskite compounds .",
    "such calculations have proven capable of providing accurate structural properties and fe distortions for perovskites at zero temperature.@xcite    recently , a thermodynamic theory based upon such first - principles calculations was developed to study the finite - temperature properties of batio@xmath1@xcite and predicted the correct transition sequence and fairly accurate transition temperatures .",
    "this thermodynamic approach involves three steps : ( i ) constructing an effective hamiltonian to describe the important degrees of freedom of the system ; ( ii ) determining all the parameters of this effective hamiltonian from high - accuracy _ ab - initio _ lda calculations ; and ( iii ) performing monte carlo simulations to determine the phase transformation behavior of the resulting system .",
    "a similar approach was also successfully applied to pbtio@xmath0 by rabe and waghmare.@xcite    the construction of the effective hamiltonian is carried out in view of the special structure properties of cubic perovskite compounds . at higher temperature , the cubic perovskite compounds abo@xmath0 have a simple cubic structure with o atoms at the face centers and metal atoms a and b at the cube corner and body center , respectively .",
    "the two most common instabilities result from the softening of either a polar zone - center phonon mode , leading to a fe phase , or the softening of a non - polar zone - boundary mode involving rotations of oxygen octahedra , leading to an afd phase .",
    "( in some cases a zone - boundary polar mode may also occur , leading to an afe phase . ) in our previous thermodynamic theory for batio@xmath0 , we assumed fe and strain distortions would be the only important degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "in other words , all other distortions are assumed to be much higher in energy .",
    "this is true for batio@xmath0 , but not true for cubic perovskites in general . as shown in our recent first - principle calculations,@xcite most cubic perovskite compounds may also undergo afd transitions . to study these compounds , we need to extend our theory to include afd distortions among the low - energy distortions .",
    "this extended theory would also allow us to study the interaction between fe and afd instabilities .",
    "however , because the afd distortion is a zone - boundary distortion without a clear corresponding zone - center mode , the extension is not trivial .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we go through the detailed procedure for the construction of the effective hamiltonian with the afd distortion included . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe our first - principles calculations and the determination of the expansion parameters for the three compounds srtio@xmath0 , catio@xmath0 , and nanbo@xmath0 . in sec .",
    "iv , we report our calculated transition temperatures , phase sequences , and order parameters for those three compounds . we also identify the differences between the correlation functions of the fe and afd local modes in srtio@xmath0 . sec .",
    "v concludes the paper .",
    "in our previous development,@xcite we argued that the total energy of a cubic perovskite can be well approximated by a low - order taylor expansion over all the relevant low - energy distortions , specifically fe distortions and strain .",
    "the fe distortions are represented by local modes , whose arrangement will reproduce the fe soft phonon modes throughout the brillouin zone ( bz ) . to extend the theory",
    "to include the afd distortions , we need to construct a new set of local modes to represent the lowest afd modes over the whole bz , or at least over the portion of the bz where the energy change due to the afd distortions is either negative , or positive but small .",
    "the afd mode typically has the lowest energy at the zone - boundary r ( 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.5)@xmath2 and m [ ( 0.5 , 0.5 , 0)@xmath2 , etc . ] points , while near the zone center @xmath3 the energy is very high .",
    "so it is necessary to choose local modes that will accurately reproduce the potentially soft modes in the vicinity of the r and m points .",
    "the rotation of an isolated oxygen octahedron can be represented by a pseudovector passing through its center .",
    "assuming the origin of coordinates at the center of the octahedron , a pseudovector with polarization @xmath4 involves displacements @xmath5 for oxygen atoms at ( @xmath6/2,0,0 ) and displacements @xmath7 for atoms at ( 0,@xmath8/2,0 ) . here",
    "@xmath9 is the lattice constant of the ideal cubic perovskite . in the case of the abo@xmath0 perovskite crystal",
    ", we can represent octahedral rotation using pseudovectors sitting on the center of each octahedron , i.e. , on the b atoms .",
    "however , neighboring octahedra share oxygen atoms , so that some continuity conditions would have to be imposed if we were to insist that the displacement of a given oxygen be consistently described by both neighboring pseudovectors . with such constraints",
    "the neighboring pseudovectors would no longer be independent of one another , leading to potential problems in the implementation of the monte carlo simulations .",
    "to avoid such problems , we simply construct a set of `` virtual '' pseudovectors @xmath10 which are independent of each other , and let the actual oxygen displacements be the superposition of the displacements that would result from these . to be precise , let @xmath11 denote the pseudovector centered on the b atom of unit cell @xmath12 ( position vector @xmath13 ) , so that each oxygen atom is shared by two pseudovectors .",
    "the physical displacement of the oxygen atom shared by @xmath10 and @xmath14 is then given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the afd soft modes of interest at r and m are then easily represented by the corresponding pattern of pseudovectors .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath18 reproduces one of the m - point modes polarized along @xmath4 .",
    "( here , @xmath19 , etc . )",
    "other possible choices of the pattern of pseudovectors correspond to other modes which are probably higher in energy , but possibly still relevant for some materials .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath20 corresponds to an x - point mode that can be regarded as either of afd character polarized along @xmath21 , or of afe character polarized along @xmath4 . finally , note that choosing @xmath22 constant ( @xmath3-point arrangement ) gives rise to no displacements whatever .    in view of this last point , it is important realize that the @xmath23 themselves do not have direct physical meaning ; only differences between adjacent @xmath10 s are physical",
    ". adding a constant to all @xmath10 s will not change the physical configuration of the system .",
    "so any physical distortions can be mapped to infinitely many pseudovector arrangements , but any pseudovector arrangement only corresponds to one specific physical distortion . because only the pseudovector differences between sites have physical meaning ,",
    "the hamiltonian should be expanded in terms of these differences , not the pseudovectors themselves . using this approach",
    ", we reduce the number of degrees of freedom associated with oxygen displacements perpendicular to the o  b bonds from six to three , and raise the symmetry of the system considerably . as a result",
    ", the taylor expansion is significantly simplified .",
    "the two other low - energy distortions , the fe and elastic distortions , are treated as in ref .. briefly , for each unit cell of the abo@xmath0 perovskite structure , we define a fe local - mode centered on the b site , and a displacement local mode centered on the a site .",
    "the former is chosen in such a way that a uniform superposition of fe local modes reproduces the soft to mode obtained by diagonalizing the force - constant matrix at the brillouin zone center .",
    "the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the vector amplitudes of the fe and translational local modes , respectively , in the @xmath12th unit cell .",
    "( note the difference in notation between ref . and",
    "this paper.@xcite ) inhomogeneous strains @xmath26 are expressed in terms of differences between @xmath25 in neighboring cells , and we add six extra degrees of freedom to describe the homogeneous strain .",
    "thus , the total energy @xmath27 depends on the set of variables \\{@xmath28 } and the homogeneous strain , and is expanded in a taylor series in terms of these quantities .",
    "the expansion terms can be divided into four kinds , those involving the fe local modes @xmath29 alone , the afd modes @xmath23 alone , the strain variable @xmath25 alone , and the coupling between them , @xmath30 the part of the energy involving the fe local modes alone , @xmath31 , contains the on - site self energy , dipole - dipole interactions , and short - range residual interactions .",

    "ii.f of ref ..    it remains to present here the energy terms involving solely the afd local modes @xmath10 and those representing the coupling of the @xmath10 to the @xmath29 and @xmath25 .",
    "their expressions are presented in the following .",
    "the afd local modes @xmath10 are nonpolar and involve no dipole moment , so long - range dipole - dipole interactions need not be considered , unlike for fe local modes . recalling that only the differences of the @xmath10 between neighboring sites are physical , it is not appropriate to separate energy contributions into on - site and inter - site interactions , as we did for the @xmath33.@xcite instead , we separate the interaction into harmonic and higher - order contributions , @xmath34 in principle , all the afd energy terms should be expanded in terms of the @xmath35 expressed through eq .",
    "( [ ro ] ) . for intersite interactions",
    ", this would become very complicated because of the low crystal symmetry at the o sites .",
    "however , for harmonic terms , the expression can be simplified by expansion in terms of the @xmath10 directly with certain conditions enforced . in this case",
    ", we can write @xmath36 here , @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote cartesian components , and @xmath39 is a function of @xmath40 and should decay very fast with increasing @xmath41 .",
    "we need to impose conditions on the @xmath42 reflecting the fact that the dependence of the energy on the @xmath10 is only through differences between neighboring sites [ eq .",
    "( [ ro ] ) ] .",
    "the appropriate conditions are @xmath43 where the sum is over sites @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",
    "this reflects the fact that if we make a change @xmath46 for all the pseudovectors in an @xmath47-@xmath48 plane at a distance of @xmath49 unit cells away from the site @xmath12 , the resulting the `` force '' on the pseudovector on site @xmath12 should vanish .",

    "a later quantum path - integral mc simulation revealed that quantum fluctuations suppress the fe phases entirely , and reduce the afd phase transition temperature to 110k.@xcite this gives excellent agreement with experiment , which reveals a single afd phase transition at 105k,@xcite and no unambiguous phase transition ( but the presence of `` quantum paraelectric '' behavior @xcite ) at low temperature .",
    "our calculated pressure - temperature phase diagram showed that the fe and afd instabilities have opposite trends with pressure , and fe and afd instabilities tend to suppress each other .",
    "we have performed some further simulations to investigate the behavior of the afd and fe local modes , and in particular the nature of the intersite correlations for fe and afd local modes in the cubic phase but just above the phase transition temperature .",
    "the m - point afd modes do not appear to be important for srtio@xmath0 , so we focus on the two vector order parameters @xmath117 and @xmath122 associated with the zone - center fe modes and the zone - corner afd modes . since the order parameters are vectors , the correlation functions are second - rank tensors .",
    "these can be calculated from our simulations as @xmath123 where the average is taken over all the sites @xmath124 in the mc simulation cell and over all mc sweeps @xmath125 . here",
    "the @xmath126 denote the components of the fe or afd order parameters [ @xmath127 for fe , @xmath128 for afd , where @xmath129 .",
    "we can get a good picture of the nature of the correlation by investigating the diagonal elements ( @xmath130 ) only .",
    "since the three cartesian directions are equivalent , it suffices to present @xmath131 .    in fig .",
    "[ corr](a ) , we show the calculated afd correlation function @xmath132 in the two planes @xmath47-@xmath90 and @xmath47-@xmath48 for srtio@xmath0 at t=150k , in the cubic phase but just above the afd phase transition temperature of 130k .",
    "we find that the correlations are quite strong in @xmath47-@xmath48 plane , with a correlation length of about three lattice constants . along the @xmath90 direction ,",
    "even the nearest - neighbor vectors are almost completely uncorrelated .",
    "thus , the shape of the `` equal correlation surface '' for afd local modes is disc - like .",
    "this is easy to understand on the basis of the rum picture.@xcite since the afd local modes involve a rotation of oxygen octahedra , and any distortion of the oxygen octahedra involves a large energy cost ( as shown by the large magnitude of @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 ) , the afd octahedral rotations about @xmath4 correlate strongly in the @xmath47-@xmath48 direction . on the other hand , the rigidness of the octahedra does not impose any relation between @xmath90-polarized afd modes in different @xmath90 planes ( as reflected in the very small @xmath136 ) .",
    "thus , the pancake - like correlation naturally results .",
    "[ corr](b ) shows the corresponding fe correlation function @xmath137 for srtio@xmath0 at t=150k ( the fe phase transition occurs at 70k ) .",
    "its behavior is just the reverse of the afd modes , being strong along the @xmath90 direction and weak in the @xmath47-@xmath48 plane , and resulting in a needle - shaped `` equal correlation surface . ''",
    "this behavior is a direct consequence of the anomalously large mode effective charges in the cubic perovskite compounds@xcite which strongly suppress the longitudinal fe fluctuations and leads to the strong correlation of @xmath138 in the @xmath90 direction . on the other hand ,",
    "the transverse fe modes can easily go soft , resulting in a short correlation length for @xmath138 in the @xmath47-@xmath48 plane .",
    "the above picture of the correlation functions for afd and fe local modes are presumably quite general for the cubic perovskite compounds . for the fe modes",
    ", we decided to repeat the calculations for the case of batio@xmath0 , where the afd instability does not intervene .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ corr](c ) the correlation function calculated in the cubic phase at t=320k , about 20k above the fe phase transition temperature .",
    "we can see the behavior of the correlations is again needle - like and even more pronounced than for srtio@xmath0 , presumably because we are closer to the fe transition temperature .",
    "( an elongated supercell was used to accomodate the correlations in this case . )",
    "= 3.0 in    as was done for the fe modes in batio@xmath0,@xcite it is revealing to compute the equilibrium distribution of one cartesian component of the afd order parameter @xmath122 in the cubic phase just above the phase transition temperature in srtio@xmath0 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ sr_dos ] , where it can be seen that the distribution looks approximately maxwellian .",
    "this is indicative of a transition having a character much closer to the displacive than to the order - disorder limit .",
    "catio@xmath0 is one of the more complicated perovskites .",
    "experimentally , it is found to have two stable phases , an orthorhombic phase at lower @xmath139 and a cubic phase above @xmath140k.@xcite some recent experiments suggest that the transition is to a highly disordered cubic phase.@xcite the room - temperature orthorhombic phase has a very complicated structure with a 20-atom unit cell .",
    "the displacements of all the atoms away from their idea positions have been determined in ref .  .",
    "the refined structure as a function of temperature has also been determined recently using x - ray diffraction.@xcite this complicated structure can be decomposed into a simultaneous freezing in of three afd modes : an r - point mode polarized along ( 1@xmath1410 ) with rotation angle 0.20 ( angles in radians ) , an m - point mode polarized along ( 001 ) with rotation angle 0.14 , and an x - point mode polarized along ( 1@xmath1410 ) .",
    "the x - point mode involves not only the rotation of oxygen octahedra , but also an associated displacement of ca atoms .",
    "the ratio of o and ca displacement is about @xmath142 and the oxygen octahedral rotation angle is only about 0.03 .",
    "for such a complicated structure , even a complete first - principles determination of its @xmath143 structure would be very difficult .",
    "however , we can arrive at a partial understanding of this structure as follows .",
    "our calculations show that the reference cubic structure is unstable towards either the r - point or the m - point afd mode individually ( negative @xmath144 ) , whereas it is _ stable _ with respect to the x - point mode individually ( positive @xmath144 , no double - well behavior ) .",
    "in fact , the x - point mode involves a strong distortion of the oxygen octahedron , and thus is far from soft .",
    "however , the symmetry of the crystal is such that if both the r - point and m - point afd mode distortions are already simultaneously present , then the ca and o atoms experience forces in the pattern of the x - point mode , as a result of the cubic anharmonic interactions discussed in sec .",
    "thus , under these conditions the crystal would necessarily acquire some x - point mode distortion .",
    "we therefor conclude that the appearance of the x - point mode distortion must be the result of the third - order coupling between r- , m- , and x - point afd modes .",
    "this is a major reason why we chose to include the third - order coupling in our model hamiltonian .",
    "the strain coupling is expected to be important in the determination of the actual magnitude of the x - mode distortion , complicating the problem and making a complete quantitative lda determination of the x - mode amplitude difficult .",
    "= 3.0 in    to obtain the phase transition sequence , we start the mc simulation at a high temperature ( @xmath145k ) and equilibrate the system for 10,000 mc sweeps .",
    "an isotropic pressure @xmath146gpa is imposed to restore the experimental lattice constant , and all the subsequent simulations are done under this pressure . the temperature is reduced in small steps ( as small as 10k around the transition temperature ) with 30,000 mc sweeps at each @xmath139 to ensure equilibration .",
    "the order parameters are accumulated over the last 20,000 mc sweeps , after checking that they do not vary significantly over this period . in our simulation",
    ", we find that except for the r - point afd order parameters @xmath122 , all other fe or afd order parameters are zero throughout the simulation .",
    "so the only phase transition we observe is associated with @xmath122 .",
    "[ corr](a ) shows the calculated order parameters @xmath147 as a function of temperature .",
    "( what we actually plot are the averaged maximum , intermediate , and minimum absolute values of the order - parameter components . ) at high temperature ( @xmath148k ) the system is in the cubic structure , where all the components are zero .",
    "the material goes through a phase transition at 1750k , where all three order parameter components increase simultaneously .",
    "our phase transition temperature is close to the experimentally measured 1530k , but we obtain the wrong low - temperature structure .",
    "ours is rhombohedral with a 10-atom cell , instead of orthorhombic with a 20-atom cell as observed experimentally .",
    "the difference between our theoretical result and experiment is not quite as dramatic as it might seem .",
    "both the structure and the structural energy are very similar for the r - point and the m - point afd mode polarized along ( 001 ) .",
    "note that in the observed structure , the amplitude of the m - point mode is about @xmath149 times the the amplitude of the r - point mode polarized in the ( 1@xmath1410 ) direction .",
    "thus , we can say that the main difference between our calculated structure and the observed one is that one component of the r - point afd mode is replaced by an m - point mode in the observed structure . as argued above , the additional presence of the x mode",
    "is just a result of third - order anharmonic coupling .",
    "in fact , we find that if we artificially increase the third - order coupling constant @xmath102 by a factor of 5 , we recover the experimental @xmath143 structure in our mc simulations .",
    "clearly , the fact that the structure is strongly affected by relatively weak anharmonic intersite interactions makes the determination of the correct low - temperature phase very difficult in catio@xmath0 .",
    "it is possible that a more careful treatment of the cubic intersite interactions ( for example , an independent determination of the coupling constants associated with all three of the cubic anharmonic invariants discussed in sec .",
    "ii.b , or three - site or further - neighbor terms ) might bring a better agreement with experiment , although one should not rule out the possibility that neglect of quantum fluctuations@xcite or intrinsic limitations of the lda might be at fault .      experimentally , nanbo@xmath0 is probably the most complex cubic perovskite known .",
    "the high - temperature phase is the simple prototype cubic structure as in the other cubic perovskites .",
    "below 910k , a whole series of structural phase transitions has been found and at least six more phases have been identified .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the compound first goes through a cubic  tetragonal transition at 910k with freezing in of @xmath150 modes polarized along one axis .",
    "there are then three orthorhombic phases present in the temperature range 845638k , the most complicated having a unit cell containing 24 nanbo@xmath0 formula units .",
    "all of these phases can be regarded as given by rigid rotations of oxygen octahedra , accompanied by small induced x - point distortions . from 638k down to at least 170k , nanbo@xmath0 is antiferroelectric with an orthorhombic unit cell containing eight formula units . at even lower temperature ,",
    "the crystal has been reported to transform into either a rhombohedral @xcite or monoclinic@xcite structure .",
    "the complexity of the structural phase - transition sequence suggests the presence of several competing structural instabilities with very similar free energies . in principle , all the distortions involved in the observed structures of nanbo@xmath0 are included in our model .",
    "however , it is not realistic to expect that the calculated structural energies and free energies will be in exactly the right order , given the complexity of the problem and the level of accuracy of current first - principles based approaches .",
    "nevertheless , we believe a first - principles study of nanbo@xmath0 is still important in identifying the most prominent distortions , as well as for demonstrating the limitations of such approaches .",
    "the determination of the structure is done using mc simulations on a cubic @xmath151 simulation supercell .",
    "an isotropic pressure @xmath152gpa is imposed to restore the experimental lattice constant , and all the subsequent simulations are done under this pressure .",
    "we start the simulation at very high temperature and equilibrate .",
    "the temperature is reduced in small steps ranging from 10k to 50k depending on proximity to a phase transition . at each temperature step , at least 40,000 mc sweeps are used to ensure that equilibrium is reached .",
    "the order parameters are accumulated over the last 30,000 mc sweeps .",
    "the calculated averages of order parameters @xmath153 and @xmath117 are shown in fig .",
    "[ corr](b ) as a function of temperature .",
    "all other modes are found to be zero throughout the simulation . as was the case for catio@xmath0 ,",
    "the averaged maximum , intermediate , and minimum absolute - value components are plotted . at high temperature ( @xmath154k ) , the system is in the cubic structure with all the order - parameter components close to zero .",
    "as @xmath139 decreases to about 700k , one afd component increases rapidly and becomes significantly non - zero , and the structure transforms from cubic to tetragonal . with further decrease of temperature ,",
    "a second component became non - zero , indicating the occurrence of an orthorhombic phase .",
    "below 560k , a third afd component grows and the structure becomes rhombohedral . at very low temperature ( below 50k ) , the simulation also apparently shows a sequence of three ferroelectric transitions , and the compound ends up in a rhombohedral ferroelectric structure at very low temperature .",
    "our first cubic  tetragonal phase transition compares favorably with experiment ; we obtain the correct structure and underestimate the transition temperature by only @xmath15520% . in the orthorhombic phase , however , the calculated structure is much simpler than the observed one .",
    "only one orthorhombic phase seems to occur in our simulation .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ corr](b ) shows signs of fluctuations occurring in the vicinity of this phase ( these fluctuations persist even if the number of mc sweeps is increased significantly ) .",
    "this indicates that the orthorhombic phase is not very stable , and may involve a mixing of different phases .",
    "moreover , the transitions do not appear very distinct in fig .",
    "[ corr](b ) as a result of finite - size broadening , so increasing the lattice size may help to resolve the different phases . however , the computational load increases rapidly with increasing lattice size , and it becomes impractical to carry out simulations at much larger size .",
    "our inability to get the correct afe phase at room temperature is probably the most significant failure of our approach .",
    "our zero - temperature structure is ferroelectric , but since the fe phases occur only at such low temperatures , it is likely that quantum fluctuations would need to be included to determine the actual low - temperature structure.@xcite",
    "in this and previous studies , we perform a series of _ ab initio _ studies of the thermodynamic properties of perovskite compounds . without introducing any adjustable parameters , we have calculated structural transition sequences , transition temperatures , phase diagrams , and other thermodynamic properties based on first - principles calculations . for compounds with simple phase transitions , like batio@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0",
    ", our calculated thermodynamic properties agree very well with experiment observations . for more complicated compounds like catio@xmath0 and nanbo@xmath0",
    ", our results are less satisfying .",
    "there are two major sources of errors , the inaccuracy of lda calculations and the imperfection of our models .",
    "our lda calculations have been carefully performed to avoid possible errors , and convergence has been carefully tested . as for the intrinsic accuracy of lda ,",
    "our calculated structural parameters and energies are within a few percent of experimental values .",
    "although this is the usual high accuracy observed generally for the lda , it is unfortunately not enough for truly accurate determination of the thermodynamic properties of perovskites .",
    "for example , it is embarrassing that we are forced to choose between carrying out the calculations at the theoretical equilibrium lattice constant or the experimental lattice constant ( negative fictitious pressure ) ; this choice can affect phase transition temperature by @xmath155100% .",
    "we regard this as being the most important probable source of error in our calculations .",
    "it is also possible to improve our model hamiltonian .",
    "for example , our restricted assumption for the form of the third - order intersite interactions may be lifted , resulting in a significantly more complicated model hamiltonian .",
    "also , other higher - order terms can be included in the hamiltonian .",
    "it would also be possible to include more degrees of freedom per cell , or include eigenvector information from more k - points of the brillouin zone when defining the local - mode vectors , to treat other phonon excitations more accurately.@xcite however , in view of the current accuracy of first - principles calculations , we are not sure that these modifications would dramatically improve our results .    finally , we emphasize that all of the mc simulations reported here treat the atomic motion purely classically .",
    "as mentioned above , we have recently reported results of quantum path - integral mc simulations showing that quantum fluctuations of the atomic coordinates ( i.e. , zero - point motion ) can shift transition temperatures by tens of degrees , and in some cases even eliminate delicate phases.@xcite certainly this remains an important avenue of investigation for catio@xmath0 and nanbo@xmath0 , but we nevertheless think it unlikely that inclusion of quantum fluctuations would immediately resolve the discrepancies with the experimental phase diagrams for these compounds .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have extended our previous first - principles theory for perovskite ferroelectric phase transitions to treat also antiferrodistortive transitions .",
