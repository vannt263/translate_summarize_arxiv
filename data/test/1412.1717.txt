    "a random univariate polynomial is a univariate polynomial whose coefficients are picked from a random distribution . studying the roots of random polynomials is a classic problem in mathematics due to its numerous applications in many areas of mathematics and engineering , e.g. , random matrix theory , hydrology , meteorology , aerodynamics , and structural engineering  @xcite .",
    "other situations also lead to solving random polynomials including solving polynomials where coefficients are subject to random noise ; the solutions of differential equations with random coefficients ; problems in spectral theory of random matrices ; polynomial regression ; and the development computer algebra methods  @xcite .",
    "recently , more applications have emerged from theoretical physics , especially in statistical physics , e.g. ,  @xcite , quantum mechanics , e.g. ,  @xcite , and string theory , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the roots of certain random polynomials are also related to minimizing the energy of charged particles on a sphere  @xcite , i.e. , smale s 7th problem  @xcite .",
    "formally , a random polynomial is given as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the degree of the polynomial and the coefficients @xmath3 are random numbers picked from a distribution .",
    "the fundamental theorem of algebra yields that the number of complex roots of @xmath4 is @xmath2 , counting multiplicity .",
    "since writing the exact roots of @xmath4 as a general algebraic expression of the coefficients @xmath5 for @xmath6 is not possible in general , due to the abel - ruffini theorem , we use numerical root - finding methods .",
    "there are numerous numerical methods available to find roots of univariate polynomials with floating point coefficients , e.g. , companion matrices , the aberth method , and the jenkins - traub method .",
    "all of these methods work well in certain cases ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive review ) .",
    "there are also several symbolic methods to solve polynomials with rational coefficients , but the random polynomials under consideration will generally not have rational coefficients .    approximating",
    "the roots of univariate polynomials with moderate degrees starts becoming an increasingly difficult task .",
    "however , in theory , numerical approximation methods typically have complexity around @xmath7 , but have the disadvantage of yielding only approximated results .",
    "this introduces the need to define what we actually consider a `` good approximation '' of a polynomial root .",
    "`` good '' numerical methods often are backward - stable , that is , the results obtained at the end are exact results of a slightly perturbed input . unfortunately , for ill - conditioned problems , even if they are posed in an exact setting , this might not be enough to provide bounds on the quality of the result .",
    "smale defined `` good enough '' as being in the quadratic convergence zone of newton s method for an exact root of the polynomial so that the exact root can be efficiently approximated to arbitrary accuracy .",
    "a point in such a quadratic convergence zone is called an _ approximate root _ and smale showed how to certify using only data computed at the test point that it was an indeed an approximate root via @xmath0-theory .",
    "an implementation of @xmath0-theory is provided in alphacertified  @xcite .",
    "other results of this kind also exist in the literature , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "other certification techniques are available for the univariate case , which , as we will see , can lead to better inclusion results . in this paper , we compare @xmath0-theory with a global approach used in the mpsolve package @xcite .",
    "the mpsolve package implements an efficient multiprecision univariate polynomial solver which our tests show is efficient and effective at solving polynomials even as the degree increases .",
    "the main inclusion result , originally proved in the paper by tilli @xcite , roughly states that if the distance of an approximation from the root is less than @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a constant depending on the separation of the roots , then newton s method converges quadratically from the start .",
    "the constant @xmath9 can be easily computed or bounded without computing the roots by means of gerschgorin s theorem applied to a particular companion matrix .",
    "one may view this as a global method since @xmath9 depends on all of the roots whereas @xmath0-theory is a local method .",
    "since we are focusing on random polynomials where , with probability @xmath10 , @xmath4 has @xmath2 distinct roots , the global root separation bound will be positive .",
    "thus , this global method is applicable for the problems under consideration .",
    "the output of the software mpsolve is well - suited for this random context : it can deliver good approximations using multiprecision arithmetic ( given exact input , it obtains the roots to an arbitrary number of digits ) , can guarantee the inclusion radii , and can certify if a root is real . in this way , we were able to solve large samples of random polynomials and to certifiably count the number of real roots .    for concrete problems ,",
    "we work with two different sets of random polynomials : coefficients are independently picked from the gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance one , and from the standard cauchy distribution . since the gaussian case is well studied with many analytical results available , we use this as our benchmark system .",
    "the cauchy case is relatively under - studied and , except for the mean number of real roots , analytical results are usually not available .",
    "hence , our numerical results for the cauchy case can provide much needed input for potentially leading to new analytical results .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . section  [ sec : numerical_methods ] describes numerical methods under consideration for approximating roots of univariate polynomials as well as discusses two certification methods .",
    "we also pictorially show the certifiable regions of a simple and exactly solvable polynomial equation .",
    "section  [ sec : numerical_set_up ] describes our setup for solving and certifying the roots of random polynomials .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] highlights some differences between the two certification methods , especially as the degree increases , and provides numerical results for various quantities associated to random polynomials .",
    "one common approach for solving univariate polynomial equations is to use the companion matrix .",
    "this method is widely used in mathematical software such as matlab . after describing the companion matrix method",
    ", we summarize smale s @xmath0-theory followed by the certification approach based on gerschgorin s theorem used in mpsolve .",
    "the global nature of certification based on gerschgorin s theorem generally provides larger certification regions due to exploiting more information about the roots than the local @xmath0-theory approach .",
    "this section ends with certification methods for detecting real roots .",
    "suppose that for @xmath4 presented in , the leading coefficient @xmath11 is nonzero , i.e. , @xmath4 is a univariate polynomial of degree  @xmath2 .",
    "one can find the roots of @xmath4 by computing the eigenvalues of the companion matrix : @xmath12 since @xmath4 is the characteristic polynomial of @xmath13 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath13 can be computed , for example , using the qr algorithm as implemented in lapack @xcite .",
    "the roots ( ) command in matlab uses this companion matrix method .      due to conditioning of @xmath13 , the approximations of the roots of @xmath4 computed by , for example",
    ", lapack or matlab , using double precision may not be in a quadratic convergence zone of newton s method .",
    "one way to certify they are indeed in a quadratic convergence zone is to use @xmath0-theory .",
    "although the approach works for more general situations , we focus on univariate polynomials @xmath4 of degree @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the first derivative of @xmath4 and @xmath15 be the @xmath16 derivative .",
    "a newton iteration of @xmath4 starting at @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 clearly , if @xmath19 , then @xmath20 if and only if @xmath21 .    newton s method relies upon repeatedly applying newton iterations . for simplicity",
    ", the @xmath16 newton iteration will be denoted @xmath22    after defining the notion of an approximate root , we state a theorem which can be used to certify that a point is indeed an approximate root without _ a priori _ knowledge about the exact root .",
    "a point @xmath17 is an _ approximate root _ of @xmath4 with associated root @xmath23 if , for each @xmath24 , @xmath25 that is , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is in the quadratic convergence basin of @xmath23 for @xmath4 .",

    ".    given two approximate roots @xmath31 and @xmath32 , they must have distinct associated roots , via the triangle inequality , if @xmath33 this and several other @xmath0-theoretic algorithms are implemented in the software package alphacertified @xcite which , among other things , has been recently used to certify solutions to multivariate problems arising in theoretical physics and chemistry @xcite .    in the present article , we take advantage of the fact that random polynomials of degree @xmath2 have , with probability @xmath10 , @xmath2 distinct complex roots .",
    "this means that if we find @xmath2 approximate roots with distinct associated roots , we have accounted for _ all _ of the roots .",
    "another way to certify a point is an approximate root of a univariate polynomial is the following global approach .",

    "the following combines theorem  [ thm : newtonisolation ] and lemma  [ lem : newtonradius ] to allow one to algorithmically verify that a given point is an approximate root given information about all of the roots .",

    "for @xmath38 , it follows immediately from that @xmath48 .",

    "it was observed in @xcite that @xmath0-theory can be used to certifiably decide the reality or nonreality of the associated root given an approximate root .",
    "this local certification test is based on the simple fact that a root of @xmath4 is real if and only if there is a real approximate root .",
    "corollary  [ cor : gerschgorin ] can be used to develop a global certification test as developed in the following which uses @xmath89 and @xmath90 to denote the real and imaginary part , respectively , of a number @xmath91 .",

    "hence , the conjugate of @xmath41 , namely @xmath99 , is also a root of @xmath4 .",
    "so , there must exists @xmath100 such that @xmath101 . observe that condition @xmath102 implies that every circle centered in @xmath103 , @xmath104 can not intersect the circle @xmath105 . in particular , this implies that the complex conjugate of @xmath41 can not be a root of @xmath4 , unless @xmath41 is a real root .    in the random setting",
    "where , with probability @xmath10 , the univariate polynomial @xmath4 of degree @xmath2 will have @xmath2 distinct roots , we are trying to yield a set of @xmath2 points consisting of approximate roots with distinct associated roots . when the roots have a large pairwise separation , numerical methods such as those implemented in mpsolve yield an effective tool for approximating such points .",
    "as the minimum of the pairwise distance decreases , one needs to use higher precision in order to yield approximations to separate the roots and achieve quadratic convergence of newton s method . in the limit",
    "when the minimum pairwise distance is zero , standard newton s method can only achieve linear convergence . in this case , for example , mpsolve can compute an approximation correct to @xmath62 digits , where the integer @xmath62 is selected by the user .      as a comparison of the two certification methods , we consider a `` wilkinson - type '' polynomial @xmath106 which has exact integer roots in order to compare numerical results .",

    "the white regions correspond to certifiable regions where the black points are approximations computed by the roots ( ) command in matlab and mpsolve , respectively .",
    "when using mpsolve , the roots are inside the certifiable regions while the roots ( ) command , probably due to the limitation of using double precision computations , obtained roots outside of some @xmath0-theoretic certifiable quadratic convergence basins .            in the rest of the figure",
    "the areas were filled with different colors based on the root to which the newton method converges if using that point as the starting  one .",
    "we can note how the regions obtained through mpsolve s certification procedure have a similar radius , while this is not true for alphacertified .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the uniformity of the constants involved in the first strategy .",

    "then , we use two numerical root - finding methods and two certification methods .    first , we approximate all of the roots using either the companion matrix method as implemented in matlab s roots ( ) command or using mpsolve",
    ".    to use @xmath0-theory to certify the roots , we compute a set of @xmath107 rational approximations @xmath108 of the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath109 such that , for each @xmath110 we have @xmath111 . with numerically estimated roots and rational coefficients in hand",
    ", we use alphacertified using @xmath112-bit floating point arithmetic to certify the approximated roots .",

    "as an alternative approach , we use the approach presented in section  [ subsec : mpsolve ] to obtain approximate solutions for the roots of a given polynomial .",
    "mpsolve provides a matlab interface which allows the user to request an arbitrary number of digits and certify the result .",
    "this approach is valuable because it alleviates the numerical ill - conditioning issues that may be encountered when solving high degree polynomials with ( possibly big ) integer coefficients . for these cases , the matlab s roots ( ) command , even if using a backward stable algorithm , can give very poor approximations of the roots . as a consequence ,",
    "it is possible that alphacertified may not be able to certify them due to large errors .",
    "this issue is solved by mpsolve using a global approach that is guaranteed to produce @xmath113 correct digits on the output ( and certify they are approximate solutions ) .",
    "a suitable level of floating point multiprecision will be used by mpsolve internally to achieve this , but it may be not necessary to expose this to matlab ( unless more than @xmath113 digits are required ) .",
    "this method is effective in our experiments . as an example",
    ", we solved @xmath114 random polynomials of degrees between @xmath115 and @xmath116 using mpsolve , which was able to certify all the roots and determine their reality . while in principle it may happen that a root can not be classified via theorem  [ thm : mpsolve_real_classification ] , this did not happen in our experiments .",
    "the following presents our results for the roots of random polynomials with coefficients taking indenpendent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "values from two distributions : the gaussian distribution with mean @xmath117 and variance @xmath10 which is one of the most extensively studied cases and can serve as our benchmark as many analytical results are available here , and the cauchy distribution for which only a handful of analytical results are available and hence our numerical results can provide valuable input to the theory .      while trying to approximate the roots , we wished to ensure that our numerical approximations were in the quadratic convergence zone of newton s method . in section  [ sec : numerical_methods ] , two different certification methods are discussed .",
    "the first , based on @xmath0-theory , which requires that @xmath118 , is a local certification approach in that it requires only data from one point .",
    "the second , based on gerschgorin s theorem , which requires that the newton correction is smaller than the relative distance between the roots divided by approximately @xmath119 , is a global certification approach in that it requires information about all roots simultaneously .",
    "the second approach can be reformulated in the same framework as @xmath0-theory if we replace @xmath120 with @xmath121 .",
    "one can now compare the mean value of @xmath122 at the roots of @xmath4 with @xmath123 with the smaller value leading to a larger  certification  region .",
    "if we assume that the distance of the roots is proportional to @xmath124 , which is a realistic expectation for random polynomials , then @xmath125 .",
    "experimentally , we have verified that @xmath120 in the @xmath0-theory has an exponential growth , as can be clearly seen in figure  [ fig : meangamma ] .",
    "this causes certification to be computationally prohibitive as @xmath2 increases .",
    "for example , using only double precision , figure  [ fig : meangamma ] suggests that degrees less than @xmath115 are feasible using double precision , but may be insufficient for degrees larger than @xmath115 due to large values of @xmath122 .     and @xmath126 constants for random cauchy polynomials with degree between @xmath127 and @xmath115 .",
    "]    it is important to note that the comparison between these two strategies is not fair since @xmath120 is directly computable given a single approximation while @xmath126 needs to be bounded using some kind of inclusion theorem since it relies on the ( unknown ) distance between roots of @xmath4 .",
    "however , our numerical results should provide valuable feedback when comparing the two certification procedures .",
    "in particular , our experiments showed that the usage of the second strategy , using a global approach , is much more effective for the cases under consideration .    in section  [ subsec : mpsolve ]",

    "we have performed a simulation on @xmath114 random polynomials to check the theoretical estimates in @xcite .",
    "the results can be seen in figure  [ fig : cauchy_gauss_mean_maxima ] .      with the same data obtained above we",
    "can also estimate the variance of the number of zeros , which is summarized in figure  [ fig : maxima_variance ] .",
    "we note that the analysis for the minima is totally symmetric .",
    "we now measure the minima for which @xmath156 . in a string theory set up ,",
    "such minima are called _",
    "de  sitter minima_. in this set up , @xmath151 evaluated at a minimum corresponds to the cosmological constant .",
    "since the observations have revealed that the cosmological constant is always positive definite , the search is then restricted to minima with @xmath156 .",
    "it is easy to see that in our case if @xmath157 and @xmath158 then by defining @xmath159 we have that @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "in particular this implies that the mean number of minima points where @xmath162 are bound to be equal to the mean number of minima points where @xmath151 is negative due to symmetry reasons .",
    "so we can expect that the number of positive minima will be half of the negative ones .",
    "the only question that we can ask is what can be said about the variance of this number .",
    "the results of this analysis are reported in figure  [ fig : variancepositivemaxima ] .",
    "similarly to the variance of positive roots , we see that the variance is slowly increasing with the degree and it is also slowly converging with the size  of  the  sample .          for multivariate random potentials ,",
    "an important physical quantity is the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix evaulated at the real stationary points .",
    "the distribution of the eigenvalues of random multivariate potentials is well studied in theoretical and statistical physics .",
    "it is shown that in certain cases the distribution follows wigner s semicircle law . here , for the univariate random potential case",
    ", we want to analyze the distribution of the evaluations of @xmath163 on the real roots . due to the very high oscillations of the value of @xmath163",
    "given the high degree of the polynomials , we were able to easily analyze only the case of degree @xmath115 .",
    "we decided to numerically estimate the distribution of @xmath164 instead of estimating @xmath163 to obtain a much more meaningful plot .",

    "finding roots of high - degree univariate polynomials with coefficients chosen from particular random distributions , though a very important task that is related to advances in many different areas of science , mathematics and engineering , is a highly nontrivial task .",
    "though there are several numerical root - finding methods available , the numerical approximates found by these methods may turn out to be in the linear or even worse in the chaotic convergence region of the nearby exact root . in this work , we attempted to find certified roots of such high - degree univariate polynomials .",
    "in particular , we used two different certification methods to certify if the numerical approximates are within the quadratic convergence region , namely based on smale s @xmath0-theory , a local method , and gerschgorin s theorem , a global method .",
    "we first find all the potential numerical approximates of a univariate polynomial using traditional methods such as the companion matrix method as implemented in matlab s roots ( ) command , or the multiprecision method implemented in mpsolve .",
    "then , we certify if the numerical approximates are certifiable in the above mentioned sense , using both the certification methods via alphacertified and mpsolve .",
    "we compared these methods based on the local conditioning constant @xmath122 from @xmath0-theory with @xmath123 arising from gerschgorin s theorem . in our experiment , the average of @xmath122 increases exponentially with the degree whereas @xmath123 increases polynomially in the degree .",
    "one advantage of smale s @xmath0-theory is that it is a local method .",
    "that is , it can be performed using data computed at one point .",
    "this allows for a quite independent and self - contained analysis of the method . on the other hand , relying on universal ,",
    "worst - case methods often causes the bounds to grow very fast .",
    "global methods , which are based on the minimum distance between the roots , can alleviate the fast growth at the expense of computing all of the roots .",
    "we emphasize that , given a high - degree polynomial , multiprecision computations may be needed to perform the computations .",
    "this is also true in cases where only floating point output ( @xmath113 digits ) is desired but , due to the ill - conditioning of the problem , an intermediate algorithm implemented in multiprecision might be able to obtain all the @xmath113 digits .      1",
    ".   the available theoretical results are easily verifiable experimentally , as we have shown , for example , in figure  [ fig : cauchy_gauss_mean ] for the expected value for the number of real roots ; 2 .",
    "there is some additional difficulties in the theoretical analysis of cauchy random polynomials given by the fact that the cauchy distribution does not have moments of any finite order , e.g. , it is not possible to apply maslova s theorem , but experimental results show that the variance of the number of real roots has a behaviour compatible with the maslova s estimate .",
