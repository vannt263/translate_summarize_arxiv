    "costas loop is a classical phase - locked loop ( pll ) based circuit for carrier recovery and signal demodulation @xcite .",
    "the pll is an automatic control system which is designed to generate an electrical signal ( voltage ) , the frequency of which is automatically tuned to the frequency of the input ( reference ) signal .",
    "various pll based circuits are widely used in modern telecommunications , computer architectures , electromechanical systems ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . nowadays among the applications of costas loop",
    "there are global positioning systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , wireless communication ( see , e. g. , @xcite ) and others ( @xcite ) .",
    "dynamic behavior of the pll and the costas loop has been described extensively in the literature @xcite , and a number of key parameters has been defined that describe its lock - in and lock - out characteristics . when the pll is initially out of lock ,",
    "two different types of acquisition processes can occur , either the so - called lock - in process or the so - called pull - in process .",
    "the first of those is a fast process , i.e. the acquisition takes place within at most one beat note of the difference between reference frequency @xmath0 and initial vco ( voltage controlled oscillator ) frequency @xmath1 , cf .",
    "figure  [ f1 - 1 ] for signal denotations .",
    "the frequency difference for which such a fast acquisition process takes place corresponds to the lock - in range @xmath2 , and the duration of the locking process is called lock time @xmath3 . when the difference between reference and vco frequency is larger than the lock - in range but less than the pull - in range @xmath4 , a slow acquisition process occurs .",
    "the time required to get acquisition is called pull - in time @xmath5 . in case of the pll",
    "all these acquisition parameters can be approximated by characteristic parameters of the pll , i.e. from natural frequency @xmath6 and damping factor @xmath7 .        to the authors knowledge",
    "such acquisition parameters have not been analytically derived for the different types of costas loops .",
    "it seems that most authors only described the static properties of the costas loop such as the derivation of the phase error in the locked state and the like .",
    "based on methods developed earlier for the pll , the authors could now derive similar expressions for all relevant acquisition parameters of the costas loop .",
    "this enables the designer to determine the lock - in and pull - in ranges , and to estimate the duration of the corresponding processes .",
    "because the systems considered are highly non linear , exact computation of such parameters is very difficult or even impossible .",
    "therefore it is necessary to introduce a number of simplifications .",
    "this implies that the obtained results are only approximations , in some cases rather crude approximations .",
    "as will be shown in the following sections there are different types of costas loops .",
    "the very first of these loops has been described by j. costas in 1956 @xcite and was primarily used to demodulate amplitude - modulated signals with suppressed carrier ( dsb - am ) .",
    "the same circuit was used later for the demodulation of bpsk signals ( binary phase shift keying ) @xcite . with the advent of qpsk ( quadrature phase shift keying )",
    "this costas loop was extended to demodulate qpsk signals as well .",
    "these two types of costas loop operated with real signals . in case of bpsk ,",
    "the input signal @xmath8 is a sine carrier that was phase modulated by a binary signal , i.e. @xmath9 where @xmath0 is the ( radian ) carrier frequency , and @xmath10 can have two different values , either @xmath11 or @xmath12 , or two arbitrary equal and opposite values @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 can be any value . in case of qpsk ,",
    "two quadrature carriers are modulated by two modulating signals , i.e.    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 can both have two equal and opposite values @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is obvious that in both cases the input signal is a real quantity . in the following these two types of costas loop",
    "will be referred to as `` conventional costas loops '' .",
    "much later , costas loops have been developed that operate not on real signals , but on pre - envelope signals @xcite .",
    "these types of costas loops will be referred to as `` modified costas loop '' in the following sections .",
    "the block diagram shown in figure  [ f1 - 2 ] explains how the pre - envelope signal is obtained .",
    "the real input signal @xmath8 is applied to the input of a hilbert transformer [ 2 ] , [ 5 ] .",
    "the output of the hilbert transformer @xmath19 is considered to be the imaginary part of the pre - envelope signal , i.e the pre - envelope signal is obtained from @xmath20 the costas loops operating with pre - envelope signals will be referred to as `` modified costas loops '' , cf .",
    "sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] .        because there are different types of costas loops",
    "the acquisition parameters must be derived separately for each of these types .",
    "this will be performed in the following sections . in order to see how good or bad the obtained approximations",
    ", we will develop simulink models for different types of costas loops and compare the results of the simulation with those predicted by theory .",
    "the operation of the costas loop is considered first in the locked state with zero phase difference ( see figure  [ costas_locked ] ) , hence the frequency of the carrier is identical with the frequency of the vco .        by the input signal @xmath8 is the product of a transferred binary data and the harmonic carrier @xmath21 with a high frequency @xmath22 . since the costas loop is considered to be locked , the vco orthogonal output signals are synchronized with the carrier ( i.e. there is no phase difference between these signals ) .",
    "the input signal is multiplied ( multiplier block ( @xmath23 ) ) by the corresponding vco signal on the upper branch and by the vco signal , shifted by @xmath24 , on the lower branch .",
    "therefore on the multipliers outputs one has @xmath25    consider the low - pass filters ( lpf ) operation .    [ as - twice - frequency ] signals components , whose frequency is about twice the carrier frequency , do not affect the synchronization of the loop ( since they are suppressed by the low - pass filters ) .",
    "[ as - lpf - initstate ] initial states of the low - pass filters do not affect the synchronization of the loop ( since for the properly designed filters , the impact of filter s initial state on its output decays exponentially with time ) .",
    "[ as - lpf - data ] the data signal @xmath10 does not affect the synchronization of the loop .    assumptions  [ as - twice - frequency],[as - lpf - initstate ] , and [ as - lpf - data ] together lead to the concept of so - called _ ideal low - pass filter _ , which completely eliminates all frequencies above the cutoff frequency ( assumption  [ as - twice - frequency ] ) while passing those below unchanged ( assumptions  [ as - lpf - initstate],[as - lpf - data ] ) . in the classic engineering theory of the costas loop",
    "it is assumed that the low - pass filters lpf are ideal low - pass filters .    since in figure",
    "[ costas_locked ] the loop is in lock , i.e. the transient process is over and the synchronization is achieved , by assumptions  [ as - twice - frequency],[as - lpf - initstate ] , and [ as - lpf - data ] for the outputs @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the low - pass filters lpf one has @xmath28 thus , the upper branch works as a demodulator and the lower branch works as a phase - locked loop .",
    "since after a transient process there is no phase difference , a control signal at the input of vco , which is used for vco frequency adjustment to the frequency of input carrier signal , has to be zero : @xmath29 . in the general case when the carrier frequency @xmath22 and a free - running frequency @xmath30 of the vco are different",
    ", after a transient processes the control signal at the input of vco has to be non - zero constant : @xmath31 , and a constant phase difference @xmath32 may remain .",
    "consider the costas loop before synchronization ( see figure  [ costas_before_sync ] ) . here",
    "the phase difference @xmath33 varies over time , because the loop has not yet acquired lock ( frequencies or phases of the carrier and vco are different ) .        in this case , using assumption  [ as - twice - frequency ] , the signals @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be approximated as @xmath36 approximations depend on the phase difference of signals , i.e. two multiplier blocks ( @xmath23 ) on the upper and lower branches operate as phase detectors .",
    "the obtained expressions with @xmath37 coincide with well - known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) phase detector characteristic of the classic pll with multiplier / mixer phase - detector for sinusoidal signals .    by assumptions",
    "[ as - lpf - initstate ] and [ as - lpf - data ] the low - pass filters outputs can be approximated as @xmath38 since @xmath39 , the input of the loop filter ( lf ) is @xmath40 such an approximation is called a _ phase detector characteristic of the costas loop_.    since an ideal low - pass filter is hardly realized , its use in the mathematical analysis requires additional justification .",
    "thus , the impact of the low - pass filters on the lock acquisition process must be studied rigorously .",
    "the relation between the input @xmath41 and the output @xmath42 of the loop filter has the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant matrix , the vector @xmath45 is the loop filter state , @xmath46 are constant vectors , h is a number .",
    "the filter transfer function has the form : @xmath47 the control signal @xmath42 is used to adjust the vco frequency to the frequency of the input carrier signal @xmath48 here @xmath30 is the free - running frequency of the vco and @xmath49 is the vco gain . the solution of with initial data @xmath50 ( the loop filter output for the initial state @xmath50 ) is as follows @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the impulse response of the loop filter and @xmath53 is the zero input response of the loop filter , i.e. when the input of the loop filter is zero .",
    "[ as - lf - initstate ] zero input response of loop filter @xmath54 does not affect the synchronization of the loop ( one of the reasons is that @xmath54 is an exponentially damped function for a stable matrix @xmath44 ) .",
    "consider a constant frequency of the input carrier : @xmath55 and introduce notation @xmath56 then assumption  [ as - lf - initstate ] allows one to obtain the classic mathematical model of pll - based circuit        in signal s phase space ( see figure  [ f2 - 1b ] ) : @xmath57    for the locked state a linear pll model can be derived , which is shown in figure  [ linear - pll ] .",
    "this model is useful for approximation of hold - in range .        in the locked state",
    "both reference and vco frequencies are approximately the same , hence the input of the lowpass filter is a very low frequency signal .",
    "therefore the lowpass filter can be ignored when setting up the linear model of the costas loop .",
    "the linear model is made up of three blocks , the phase detector pd , the loop filter lf and the vco . in digital costas",
    "loops the vco is replaced by a dco ( digital controlled oscillator ) .",
    "this will be discussed in later sections . for these building blocks",
    "the transfer functions are now defined as follows",
    ".    * phase detector ( pd ) .",
    "* in the locked state , the phase error @xmath58 is very small so by we can write @xmath59 with @xmath60 called phase detector gain .",
    "@xmath61    note that the uppercase symbols are laplace transforms of the corresponding lower case signals .",
    "* loop filter ( lf ) .",
    "* for the loop filter we choose a pi ( proportional + integral ) filter whose transfer function has the from @xmath62 this filter type is the preferred one because it offers superior performance compared with lead - lag or lag filters .",
    "* vco*. the transfer function of the vco is given by @xmath63 where @xmath49 is called vco gain .",
    "consider another non linear model of costas loop in figure  [ delay - costas ] ( delay model ) .",
    "here we use assumtions 13 ( initial states of filters are omitted , double - frequency terms are completely filtered by lpfs , and @xmath10 does nt affect synchronization ) and filters lpfs are replaced by the corresponding phase - delay blocks @xmath64 .",
    "outputs of low - pass filters are @xmath65 where @xmath66 then after multiplication of @xmath26 and @xmath27 we have @xmath67 and the output @xmath42 of the loop filter satisfies the following equations @xmath68 equations of costas loop in this case are @xmath69 for lpf transfer functions @xmath70 phase shift is equal to @xmath71 .",
    "therefore is equal to the following system @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "equation is hard to analyze both numerically and analytically , however this model is still useful . in the following discussion",
    "it is used to approximate pull - in range and pull - in time . for this purpose",
    "we need to simplify delay model shown in figure  [ delay - costas ] .",
    "consider block diagram in figure  [ f2 - 4a ] .",
    "the lowpass filters ( lpf ) used in both @xmath74 an @xmath75 branches are assumed to be first order filters having transfer function . as will be demonstrated later the corner frequency of these filters must be chosen such that the data signal i is recovered with sufficient accuracy , i.e. the corner frequency @xmath76 must be larger than the symbol rate .",
    "typically it is chosen twice the symbol rate , i.e. @xmath77 with @xmath78 symbol rate and @xmath79 .",
    "the output signal @xmath80 of the multiplier in the @xmath74 branch consists of two terms , one having the sum frequency @xmath81 and one having the difference frequency @xmath82 .",
    "because the sum frequency term will be suppressed by the lowpass filter , only the difference term is considered . the same holds true for signal @xmath83 in the @xmath75 branch .",
    "it will show up that the range of difference frequencies is markedly below the corner frequency @xmath76 of the lowpass filter .",
    "hence the filter gain will be nearly 1 for the frequencies of interest .",
    "as will also be shown later the phase at frequency @xmath84 can not be neglected .",
    "the lowpass filter is therefore represented as a delay block whose transfer function has the value @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the phase at frequency @xmath87 . the delayed signals @xmath88 and @xmath89 are now multiplied by the product block at the right in the block diagram .",
    "consequently the output signal @xmath41 of this block will have a frequency of @xmath90 .",
    "this signal is now applied to the input of the loop filter lf .",
    "its transfer function has been defined in ( [ loop - filter - tf ] ) .",
    "the corner frequency of this filter is @xmath91 .",
    "because the phase of the loop filter can not be neglected , it is represented as a delay block characterized by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the phase of the loop filter at frequency @xmath90 .",
    "the analysis of dynamic behavior becomes easier when the order of some blocks in figure  [ f2 - 4a ] is reversed ( see figure  [ f2 - 4b ] ) , i.e. when we put the multiplying block before the lowpass filter .",
    "because the frequency of signal @xmath41 in figure  [ f2 - 4a ] is twice the frequency of the signals @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the phase shift created by the lowpass filter at frequency @xmath90 is now twice the phase shift at frequency @xmath87 .",
    "the lpf is therefore represented here by a delay block having transfer function @xmath94 .",
    "we can simplify the block diagram even more by concatenating the lowpass filter and loop filter blocks .",
    "the resulting block delays the phase by @xmath95 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ f2 - 4c ] .",
    "the output signal @xmath42 of this delay block now modulates the frequency generated by the vco .        to compute pull - in time we need to consider costas loop model in figure  [ f2 - 1b ] with averaged signals of phase detector output @xmath96 and filter output @xmath97",
    "( see figure  [ f2 - 7 ] ) .",
    "the model is built from three blocks .",
    "the first of these is labeled `` phase - frequency detector '' .",
    "we have seen that in the locked state the output of the phase detector depends on the phase error @xmath58 . in the unlocked state ,",
    "however , the average phase detector output signal @xmath98 is a function of frequency difference as will be shown in next section ( eq .  ( [ 20 ] ) ) , hence it is justified to call that block `` phase - frequency detector '' . as we will recognize the pull - in process",
    "is a slow one , i.e. its frequency spectrum contains low frequencies only that are below the corner frequency @xmath99 of the loop filter , cf .",
    "( [ loop - filter - tf ] ) . the loop filter can therefore be modeled as a simple integrator with transfer function @xmath100 therefore @xmath101 the frequency @xmath1 of the vco output signal is defined as @xmath102 where @xmath30 is the free running frequency and @xmath49 is the vco gain .",
    "now we define the instantaneous frequency difference @xmath87 as @xmath103 substituting and ( [ 24 ] ) into ( [ 22 ] ) finally yields @xmath104      consider qpsk costas loop operation ( see figure  [ costas_after_sync ] ) for the sinusoidal carrier and vco in lock state for the same initial frequencies @xmath105 .        by , the input qpsk signal has the form @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the transmitted data , @xmath21 and @xmath108 are sinusoidal carriers , @xmath109  phase of input signal .",

    "<S> costas loop is a classical phase - locked loop ( pll ) based circuit for carrier recovery and signal demodulation . </S>",
    "<S> the pll is an automatic control system that adjusts the phase of a local signal to match the phase of the input reference signal . </S>",
    "<S> this tutorial is devoted to the dynamic analysis of the costas loop . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the acquisition process is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> acquisition is most conveniently described by a number of frequency and time parameters such as lock - in range , lock - in time , pull - in range , pull - in time , and hold - in range . while for the classical pll equations </S>",
    "<S> all these parameters have been derived ( many of them are approximations , some even crude approximations ) , this has not yet been carried out for the costas loop . </S>",
    "<S> it is the aim of this analysis to close this gap . </S>",
    "<S> the paper starts with an overview on mathematical and physical models ( exact and simplified ) of the different variants of the costas loop . </S>",
    "<S> then equations for the above mentioned key parameters are derived . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the lock - in range of the costas loop for the case where a lead - lag filter is used for the loop filter is analyzed .    </S>",
