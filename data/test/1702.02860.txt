    "disordered media may homogenize in various ways .",
    "for example , in a microscopically inhomogeneous material , the solution to the heat equation might satisfy a local limit theorem when viewed on larger scales .",
    "this might be on the entire space or within a bounded domain with certain boundary conditions . in bounded domains we can furthermore ask whether the solution to a poisson equation homogenizes as the domain s diameter , i.e. , the macroscopic scale , grows to infinity . or , alternatively",
    ", we can wonder whether the dirichlet spectrum of the associated laplace operator converges in some sense or whether the occupation time measures of the corresponding diffusion fulfill a large deviation principle .",
    "when we say that we let the macroscopic scale grow to infinity , this is always in comparison to a microscopic scale @xmath1 , which might tend to zero instead .",
    "although all these aspects of homogenization are _ a priori _ different , intuition suggests that they should somehow be related .",
    "especially if the associated laplace operator is self - adjoint , i.e. , it is the generator of a reversible random walk , then the homogenization of the poisson equation is strongly linked to spectral homogenization ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 11 ) ) .",
    "spectral homogenization in turn is linked to the validity of a large deviation principle for the occupation time measures of a random walk in bounded domains ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5 ) .",
    "it is therefore plausible that these aspects of homogenization should hold under similar conditions .    for self - adjoint laplace operators , a crucial condition for many kinds of asymptotic",
    "homogenization is ",
    "apart from ergodicity  the validity of a poincar inequality with an optimal constant independent of @xmath1 ( uniform poincar inequality ) . for spectral homogenization",
    "this is immediately evident since the optimal poincar constant is the inverse of the principal dirichlet eigenvalue of the laplacian ( see remark [ rem : optimality ] ) . in the situation of the present paper",
    ", we will see that the uniform poincar inequality is necessary and carries us quite far , although it is not completely sufficient for our results .",
    "however , it leads us to conditions that are optimal ( up to a critical case , see remark [ rem : optimality ] ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we examine a discrete disordered medium that belongs to a class of random conductance models on the lattice @xmath0 with stationary and ergodic conductances on nearest - neighbor and unbounded - range connections .",

    "case even almost sure @xcite ) that trapping structures as in figure [ fig : trap ] appear , which immediately contradict a uniform poincar inequality .",
    "in addition to poincar and sobolev inequalities , our proofs rely on stochastic two - scale convergence , an analytic method that is based on the ergodic theorem and was introduced in @xcite .    for the random conductance model with conductances",
    "@xmath11 $ ] ( @xmath12 ) restricted to nearest - neighbor connections , faggionato @xcite already used stochastic two - scale convergence in order to prove homogenization of the laplace operator with a spectral shift on the infinite connected component of @xmath0 .",
    "the spectral shift compensates for the lack of a poincar inequality .    as a consequence of the homogenization of the poisson equation on bounded domains , the homogenization of the top of the dirichlet spectrum follows by the methods of (",
    "* chapter 11 ) , see theorem [ thm : spectrum ] . for this result ,",
    "remark [ rem : optimality ] explains in which sense condition is sharp . for i.i.d .",
    "conductances even decides between a completely homogenizing phase , which we cover in this paper , and a completely localizing phase of the principal dirichlet eigenvector , which was studied in @xcite .",
    "we thus extend the results of faggionato @xcite and boivin and depauw @xcite .",
    "faggionato showed spectral homogenization in dimension @xmath13 under condition and @xmath7<\\infty$ ] , whereas boivin and depauw proved spectral homogenization for conductances that are uniformly bounded from above and away from zero ( uniform ellipticity ) .",
