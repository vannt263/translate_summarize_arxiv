    "supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) provide a natural explanation for dark matter .",
    "stability of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is ensured by a discrete symmetry , r - parity . due to the renormalization group evolution of the supersymmetric particle masses ,",
    "the lsp is naturally neutral and weakly interacting , and therefore has an annihilation cross section of the order of the one necessary for the lsp to become a good dark matter candidate .",
    "low energy supersymmetry also provides a possible solution to another outstanding problem of the standard model , namely the generation of the baryon - antibaryon asymmetry  @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , a solution to this problem by weak scale physics demands a light stop as well as non - vanishing cp - violating phases in the chargino ",
    "neutralino sector .",
    "such a light stop tends to push the lightest cp - even higgs mass to values below the current experimental bound @xcite , unless the heaviest stop mass is larger than about 10 tev .",
    "all other squarks and sleptons should also be heavy , in order to suppress the electron and neutron electric dipole moment contributions  @xcite .",
    "the required low energy theory that leads to an explanation of the origin of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry contains the sm particles , a light stop , and light electroweak gauginos and higgsinos , the latter being important for the generation of the cp - violating currents contributing to the baryon asymmetry , as well as a source of dark matter and a light higgs .",
    "although the scenario does not lead to a prediction for the non - sm higgs masses , large values of these masses , above a few 100 gev , provide a natural suppression of the two - loop contribution to the electron electric dipole moments and help in obtaining a sufficiently large value of the lightest cp - even higgs mass . for large cp - odd higgs boson masses",
    ", the lightest cp - even higgs will behave in a standard way , and therefore evidence of its presence may appear at the latest phase of the tevatron collider and should be observed in the next few years at the lhc . however , the effective couplings of the lightest higgs boson to gluons and photons are modified by a light stop @xcite , and the measurement of processes involving these couplings could provide evidence for strongly interacting new particles with relatively low mass .    more challenging is the direct search for a scalar top quark .",
    "acceptable values of the relic density for heavy cp - odd higgs bosons are naturally obtained in the stop ",
    "neutralino co - annihilation region , in which the neutralino - stop mass difference is of about a few tens of gev  @xcite . in this case , the three - body stop decay channel into @xmath0 boson , bottom quark and the lightest neutralino is kinematically closed , and the loop - induced two - body decay into a charm and a neutralino tends to be the dominant stop decay mode  @xcite .",
    "searches for a stop decaying into a charm plus missing energy at the tevatron collider rely on a sufficiently energetic charm quark , in order to trigger on these events .",
    "the charm transverse energy , in turn , is controlled by the mass difference of the stop and the neutralino . for mass differences below 40  gev",
    ", the tevatron has no sensitivity in stop searches  @xcite . for larger mass differences",
    ", however , the tevatron reach extends up to values well above the lep limit of 100 gev , allowing to explore stop masses up to 160  gev  @xcite .",
    "searches at the lhc in stop pair production are equally challenging .",
    "however , at the lhc the stop may be produced in decays of heavy gluinos .",
    "since the gluino is a majorana particle , it can decay into both a stop  antitop and top  antistop final states .",
    "pair production of gluinos may then lead to a pair of equal - sign top quarks plus two equal - sign stops .",
    "it has been shown that these events may be detected for gluino masses below 900  gev  @xcite .",
    "one would like to explore a method that would not depend so strongly on the assumption of a relatively light gluino , which is not required for either the generation of dark matter or the baryon asymmetry . in this article",
    "we propose such a method : stop particles at the lhc may be produced in association with a hard photon or a hard jet . in the co - annihilation region",
    ", there will be minimal hadronic activity associated with the stop decays and therefore this would effectively lead to events with a photon or a jet and missing energy .",
    "such a signature has been proposed , for instance , to explore extensions of the standard model by large extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out that the jet plus missing energy signature can also be useful to search for relatively light gluinos at the tevatron  @xcite . in this article",
    "we show that at the lhc these channels allow to test the whole region of stop and neutralino masses consistent with dark matter and electroweak baryogenesis ( ewbg ) that can not be covered by the tevatron searches .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sc : ewbg ] we present an overview of scenarios that accommodate a light stop .",
    "the following two sections [ sc : get ] and [ sc : jet ] are devoted to phenomenological studies of the photon plus missing energy and jet plus missing energy channels at the lhc . in section [ sc : tev ] we shortly comment about the relevance of these channels for the tevatron .",
    "section [ sc : glu ] compares our results to the reach for stops in gluino decays at the lhc .",
    "section [ sc : prop ] discusses some possibilities for identifying the stops from their decay characteristics at the lhc .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section [ sc : concl ] .",
    "although the particle content of minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model is well defined by symmetry principles , the exact spectrum depends strongly on the scale and nature of the mechanism that leads to the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "flavor physics puts strong constraints on the possible structure of supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "strong flavor changing neutral current effects may be naturally avoided if , at the messenger scale , at which supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the observable sector , the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are flavor independent . under these assumptions all squarks and sleptons with the same quantum numbers under the sm gauge group will acquire equal masses at the messenger scale .    the observable supersymmetric particle masses may be obtained by renormalization group evolution of the parameters at the messenger scale to the weak scale .",
    "there are different corrections appearing in this evolution  @xcite . on one hand , strong interaction effects , governed by the gluino mass ,",
    "drive the squark masses to larger values .",
    "there are also yukawa induced effects that push the third generation squark masses , in particular the stop masses , to smaller values .",
    "these yukawa effects are the same that drive the effective higgs mass parameter to negative values , inducing the breakdown of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "once the electroweak symmetry is broken , there is also a higgs induced mixing between the right - handed and left - handed stops , that pushes the lightest stop to small values . in general , in the scenarios with flavor independent scalar masses at the messenger scale , the lightest stop is the lightest squark , and the precise value of its mass depends on the scale of supersymmetry breaking , the gluino mass and the size of the stop mixing parameter .",
    "for relatively small values of the gluino mass and a large stop mixing mass parameter , the lightest stop can have masses of the order or smaller than the top quark mass @xcite . due to the renormalization group evolution",
    "such a light stop is dominantly the partner of the right - handed top quark , which also concurs with electroweak precision constraints .",
    "light stops may also appear in alternative solutions to the flavor problem ; since the strongest flavor physics constraints are associated with the first two generations , a simple solution is to let the first and second generation squark masses to be very large , while the stops remain light , in order to prevent large radiative corrections to the higgs mass parameter . in these `` more minimal supersymmetry '' scenarios",
    "@xcite , one considers that these conditions are fulfilled at the weak scale , independently of the gluino mass or the scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "observe , however , that unless there are additional interactions beyond the mssm , one of the stops needs to be heavier in order to prevent a higgs mass below the experimental bound @xcite .",
    "one can also consider a phenomenological scenario similar to split supersymmetry  @xcite , in which all superparticles which remain light are there for a reason  @xcite . in this case",
    ", a light stop would be necessary to induce a strongly first - order phase transition , necessary for electroweak baryogenesis , while light higgsinos and gauginos would be necessary to lead to a dark matter candidate , generate the necessary cp - violating currents and for the model to be consistent with the unification of gauge couplings at high scales .",
    "in all of the above scenarios , additional assumptions have to be made about the sfermion flavor structure to predict the width and branching ratios of the light stop . for this work",
    ", it is assumed that the two - body decay @xmath1 is enhanced by large logarithms from renormalization group evolution @xcite so that this decay channel becomes dominant and the stop decay length is too short to be observable .",
    "alternative scenarios where the partial width for @xmath2 is small lead to interesting signals from the competing four - body decay @xmath3 and displaced stop decays @xcite but will not be investigated further here .",
    "as explained in the previous section , we are interested in exploring stop production in the co - annihilation region , where the mass difference between the stop and the lightest supersymmetric particle , which we assume to be the neutralino @xmath5 , @xmath6 is of the order of a few tens of gev . in this region ,",
    "the visible decay products of the stop tend to be soft , and therefore difficult to observe at hadron colliders .",
    "however , the lack of hadronic activity in the stop decay products may be useful in searches for stops in other channels , for instance by looking at the recoil of stops against a hard photon or jet . in this section",
    ", we shall explore the possible production of a stop in association with a hard photon .",
    "since the stop decays into relatively soft jets and missing energy , the final state in the stop production channel may be taken as @xmath4 .",
    "we have therefore performed the simulation of the signal @xmath7 using comphep 4.4 @xcite , interfaced with pythia 6.4 @xcite through the cpyth toolkit 2.0.6 @xcite .",
    "pythia has been run with power showers and including stop fragmentation and hadronization @xcite before decay @xmath8 .",
    "the pythia output has been fed into the fast detector simulation pgs  @xcite , in order to simulate the most important detector effects .",
    "the @xmath4 signature has been considered previously for searches for large extra dimensions at the lhc @xcite .",
    "therefore we can use the published results for the evaluation of the standard model background at the lhc .",
    "our analysis is based on the sm background estimates by the cms collaboration in ref .",
    "the main physics background channels come from the production of weak gauge bosons , for instance , @xmath9 with @xmath10 , and @xmath11 where the electron is faking a photon .",
    "these channels may be calibrated from observations in other well measured production processes .",
    "for instance , @xmath9 with @xmath10 can be calibrated from @xmath9 with @xmath12 with a total error of 3% @xcite , using extrapolation from small @xmath13 to the signal region .    since all colored particles , including gluinos and other squarks , are considered to be heavy , with masses of about 1  tev or larger , the potentially large susy contributions to the background associated with color particle production are assumed to be negligible after applying the analysis cuts .",
    "the main irreducible susy background stems from the production of neutralinos with photons , which is , again , numerically small and can be neglected compared to the sm backgrounds .    in order to obtain a reliable estimate of the expected stop signal significance at the lhc",
    ", our analysis has been performed using similar cuts as the ones used in the cms study , ref .",

    "5 .   the photon has to be isolated .",
    "@xcite uses a likelihood method for photon isolation , but for simplicity we use the standard isolation criteria in pgs  @xcite .",
    "the impact of these details on the signal is small .    after applying these cuts",
    ", the remaining sm background is relatively small , about 2.5  fb , corresponding to 250 events for 100  fb@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the above cuts , however , also affect the signal rate , particularly for increasing values of @xmath20 due to the strong @xmath21 requirement established above .",
    "one could in principle optimize the cuts as a function of @xmath20 , but this would require a reevaluation of background , which is beyond the scope of this paper . since no cut optimization has been performed , the procedure we are applying serves therefore as a conservative estimate of the reach in the stop ",
    "neutralino mass parameter space .",
    "although the sm backgrounds are known including next - to - leading ( nlo ) qcd corrections , no such corrections are available for the @xmath22 process . in our analysis , we shall assume a k - factor of 1.4 , an estimate that comes from the calculation of the process @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "however , this value should be taken with caution since the veto of any hard real radiation jets due to our selection cuts could reduce the effective size of the radiative corrections , an effect that is partially but not precisely reproduced by the parton shower in pythia channel has sizable theoretical uncertainties .",
    "however , the jet@xmath24 channel , discussed in the next section , gives much better and more robust results . ] .",
    "after application of the cuts and the k - factor rescaling the signal event number for 100  fb@xmath19 is shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : photon_sig ] for various values of the stop and neutralino masses .",
    "._number of signal events in the @xmath4 channel for 100  fb@xmath19 and for various combinations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the numbers in the table have an intrinsic statistical uncertainty of a few events from the monte carlo error . _ [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : ctag ]    as mentioned above , charm tagging can be used to identify the flavor of the stop decay products . as an example",
    ", we have chosen the following sample parameter point : @xmath27 gev , @xmath28 gev .",
    "the signal can be detected with @xmath29 with 100 fb@xmath19 for this point , yielding 119 signal and 251 background events .",
    "if only light - flavor jets were present in the entire sample , the requirement of at least one charm - tagged jet with @xmath30 gev would reduce the event count to 23% . in reality , due to the charm jets coming from stop decays , 31.5% survive .",
    "this means that the presence of heavy flavor jets in the signal can be inferred experimentally with 2.9@xmath31 . with 300 fb@xmath19 , this improves to 5@xmath31 .",
    "[ fg : ctag ]    apart from allowing to determine the flavor of the stop decay product , charm tagging can also improve the stop discovery reach compared to the analysis in section  [ sc : get ] , where the decay products of the stops did not play any role in the signal selection . here",
    ", in addition to the cuts in section  [ sc : get ] , we demand at least one charm - tagged jet with @xmath32 gev , using the tagging efficiencies in tab .  [ tab : ctag ] . with this additional cut , we find that the region bounded by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fg : ctag ] becomes accessible in the @xmath4 channel . as evident from the figure , the discovery region",
    "is greatly extended compared to the results from section  [ sc : get ] .",
    "nevertheless , the treatment of charm tagging in this work is rather simple and rudimentary , since we are not using a full detector simulation .",
    "a detailed detector simulation is necessary to evaluate information about displaced vertices , impact parameters and tagged mesons . with a combination of all these variables",
    "more sophisticated charm tagging algorithms can be designed which could yield even better results than our analysis .",
    "once the charm jets are identified one could in principle use kinematical measurements to obtain information about the stop and neutralino masses , see for example ref .",
    "however , for the @xmath4 and jet@xmath24 channels such an analysis is very difficult due to the relatively small signal - to - background ratio and distortions stemming from the rejection of extra jets in the selection cuts . a conclusive statement about the measurability of the masses would require a detailed study with proper simulation of the backgrounds , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in this article , we have investigated the possible search for light stops in their production in association with hard photons or jets .",
    "light stops may naturally appear in many susy scenarios and are required to realize the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis in the mssm .",
    "these search channels are particularly useful in the case of small mass differences @xmath20 between the stop and the neutralino , for which the jets coming from the decay of the stops are relatively soft .",
    "such small mass differences enable the stop - neutralino co - annihilation process , yielding a dark matter density consistent with experimental observations .",
    "searches for pair of stops in two jets plus @xmath21 channels at the tevatron and the lhc require sufficiently hard jets in order to trigger on these events",
    ". for small mass differences between the stop and the neutralino these searches become therefore very challenging .",
    "the lack of hadronic activity in the stop decay products may be used as an advantage in processes in which the stops are produced in association with photons or jets , since effectively they can lead to final states with one hard photon or jet and missing energy . in this article , we have analyzed such processes .",
    "we showed that the photon plus @xmath21 channel may be used to explore most of the light stop co - annihilation region , but it becomes rapidly inefficient for relatively large mass differences @xmath20 , particularly due to the existence of large systematic errors .",
    "searches in the jet plus @xmath21 channel , instead , profit from larger production rates and lead to an extended coverage of the light stop  neutralino mass plane . these searches may be complemented with the tevatron searches , which become more efficient for larger values of @xmath20 .",
    "together , for an lhc luminosity of about 100  fb@xmath19 , they cover all of the parameter space consistent with electroweak baryogenesis , independent of the value of the gluino mass .",
    "since we have used existing experimental simulations for the background evaluation the selection cuts are not optimized for our signal process .",
    "an optimization of the cuts thus could further improve our results .",
    "we have also reanalyzed the possibility of looking for stops in events with a pair of like - sign top quarks proceeding from majorana gluino decays , and have confirmed the results of previous analyses which showed that for an lhc luminosity of 30 fb@xmath19 , these searches become efficient for gluino masses below about 900  gev .",
    "relatively light gluinos , with masses below about 1  tev , are required even for an lhc luminosity of about 300 fb@xmath19 .    in the searches described above the stop properties",
    "are not well identified in these processes .",
    "therefore , we have also analyzed the possibility of identifying stops , once an evidence of their presence in some of these processes has been observed , by identifying the associated charm jets and showed that this is possible for mass difference @xmath33 above about 10 gev .",
    "a determination of the stop and neutralino masses from the jet / photon plus @xmath21 channels seems very challenging . in the future ,",
    "a more detailed study with a realistic detector simulation should be performed to confirm our results .",

    "<S> low energy supersymmetric models provide a solution to the hierarchy problem and also have the necessary ingredients to solve two of the most outstanding issues in cosmology : the origin of the baryon asymmetry and the source of dark matter . in the mssm , weak scale generation of the baryon asymmetry may be achieved in the presence of light stops , with masses lower than about 130  gev . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , the proper dark matter density may be obtained in the stop  </S>",
    "<S> neutralino co - annihilation region , where the stop  neutralino mass difference is smaller than a few tens of gev . </S>",
    "<S> searches for scalar top quarks ( stops ) in pair production processes at the tevatron and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) become very challenging in this region of parameters . at the lhc , </S>",
    "<S> however , light stops proceeding from the decay of gluino pairs may be identified , provided the gluino mass is smaller than about 900  gev . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we propose an alternative method for stop searches in the co - annihilation region , based on the search for these particles in events with missing energy plus one hard photon or jet . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this method is quite efficient and , when complemented with ongoing tevatron searches , allows to probe stop masses up to about 160  gev , fully probing the region of parameters consistent with electroweak baryogenesis in the mssm . </S>"
