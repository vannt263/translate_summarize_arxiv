    "one might expect that at small times , corresponding to being within saddle structures , the self diffusion would be enhanced but at very small times self diffusion within saddles is smaller than for any other point in the flow .",
    "this slow behavior can be explained by the suppressed rms fluctuations within saddles resulting from a bias in the population statistics of @xmath84 .",
    "a similar argument explains the suppression of self diffusion within centers at early times .",
    "the expected enhancement in self - diffusion within saddles does not occur until times greater than @xmath182 s , where the earlier conditional lagrangian velocity correlation crosses the full lagrangian correlation function .",
    "the crossing time is where most of the trajectories have left the saddle .",
    "the conclusion , then , is that saddles enhance diffusion , but non - locally .",
    "only when the particle escapes the confines of the saddle structure and begins to surf the unstable manifold is the enhancement felt . at long times , about @xmath183 s , the trajectory begins to forget both the saddle and unstable manifold and the conditional statistics approach the full statistics .",

    "the solid line represents the unconditioned average.,width=336 ]    the self diffusion for particles beginning within centers behaves more intuitively .",
    "the suppression at small times was explained by bias in the statistics of @xmath84 . at intermediate times , smaller than the eddy rotation time",
    ", self - diffusion continues to be suppressed because the trajectories can not cross the center manifold and continue to circulate about the vortex .",
    "finally , at long times , as the centers dissolve , the conditional statistics approach the full statistics .",
    "overall , the effect of different initial conditions is not large , accounting for at most a factor of @xmath183 between centers and saddles .",
    "the results of conditioning the average @xmath163 upon the condition that a trajectory starts within a center or saddle at @xmath35 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : coherentrichardson ] . in these two - trajectory statistics the expected enhanced diffusion due to saddles is realized . from the earliest times to times as long as @xmath183 s there is an enhancement in the relative diffusion with a peak difference at about @xmath180 s. from sec .",
    "[ subsec : conditionalselfdiffusion ] recall that this earlier time is roughly the time it takes for the particles to leave the saddle structure .",
    "thus , for relative diffusion , in stark contrast to the self - diffusion presented before , saddles behave locally .",
    "once the maximum amount of enhancement occurs , the saddle statistics decay back to the full statistics as the particle pairs forget their origin within the saddle .",
    "the decay is slow most likely because some particle pairs initially straddle the stable manifold and thus exit the saddle on opposite sides and surf opposing unstable manifolds . at around @xmath183",
    "s , however , the statistics collapse back to the full statistics , much as in the case of self - diffusion , because the trajectories begin to forget their origins .",
    "two - particle lagrangian displacement @xmath163 for generated trajectories conditioned upon the type of structure the trajectory is within at time @xmath35 .",
    "the solid line represents the unconditioned average.,width=336 ]    the relative diffusion of particles within centers also behaves , more or less , as expected .",
    "the diffusion is suppressed at small times and slowly approaches the full statistics as the vortices are destroyed and the trapped trajectories are released to evolve in the background .",
    "one might be surprised that the trapping of vortices does not suppress the diffusion with respect to the full statistics more than the slight amount displayed here . to resolve this issue , consider the types of structures , other than saddles , that exist within the flow .",
    "whatever their form , for example jets , one expects that by definition @xmath84 is small , _",
    "i.e. _ , there are small velocity gradients .",
    "thus , in these regions , a pair of particles would evolve together , only separating quickly when they encounter a saddle .    to better visualize the implications of the above results on relative diffusion @xmath184 trajectories were generated from initial positions within a center region and within a saddle .",
    "the results of tracking these trajectories over time are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalarevolve ] .",
    "one can see from the figure that the initial spread for trajectories beginning within the saddles is far greater than for the corresponding center region .",
    "it should be stressed that only a few of the starting particles within the saddle account for this large spread , the majority continue to exist in the dense grouping of particles in the left of the image .",
    "this dense grouping weights statistics , such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalarevolve ] , so that they only echo a fraction of the magnitude of the spread .     the time evolution of an `` ink drop '' of generated particle tracks .",
    "the left column represents the behavior of an ink drop that initially seeds a center region .",
    "the right column is the same for a saddle region.,width=326 ]",
    "the lagrangian approach of particle diffusion was applied to the quasi-2d turbulence of a thin stratified layer .",
    "simultaneous cascades of enstrophy and energy develop although neither is strictly inertial despite larger reynolds number and smaller damping than in other stratified layer experiments @xcite .",
    "single particle diffusion follows the predictions of taylor at small times that @xmath185 and is consistent with the scaling of @xmath186 found from numerical simulations for times larger than the lagrangian velocity correlation time@xcite .",
    "the expected long - time behavior of diffusive scaling like @xmath187 is not observed owing to the finite size of the system . by separating the statistics based on the initial position within a topological saddle or center , one can understand the influence of these structures on particle diffusion .",
    "the overall effect is small with the maximum difference near @xmath188 where center dispersion is about half that of particles in the rest of the field .",
    "the behavior of two - particle separations is more complex , reflecting the competing effects of crossover between competing scalings at low to moderate reynolds number and of boundaries .",
    "the intermediate time behavior depends on the initial starting separation @xmath34 with decreasing slope for large @xmath34 .",
    "the existence of a richardson scaling range with @xmath189 is unresolved and will be presented in detail elsewhere . at short times",
    "the separation is sensitive to starting conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ , whether the initial mean position was within a saddle or center .",
    "as expected , separation increased more rapidly at small times when the particles started in a saddle and less rapidly when they were within a center .",
    "the most interesting observation for the separated statistics is the time scales at which the structures , in particular the saddles , have their greatest effect .",
    "for the two - point statistics the greatest effect of structures is felt at time scales for which the particle is within the structure .",
    "the single point statistics , on the other hand , are non - local , that is the structures greatest effect on these is at times when the particle has exited the structure .",
    "this difference might be explained by the existence of an unaccounted for structure , _",
    "e.g. _ a jet , which lurks on the outside of saddles . when a particle is advected out of the saddle , it is swept up in a jet and advected rapidly away from its starting point , which explains the enhanced self - diffusion at intermediate times .",
    "if two particles are advected into a jet they are carried along with little relative displacement , thus the two - point statistics are not enhanced .",
    "for this explanation to be compelling , the notion of a jet needs to be quantitatively defined .",
    "the potential for the lagrangian approach to the analysis of turbulence has barely been scratched by these preliminary studies .",
    "multiple - point particle tracking can be implemented easily and would provide a better measure of turbulence transfer processes .",
    "another approach would be to measure interscale transfer flux in the moving frame of a group of particles that form a particular topological structure , _",
    "e.g. _ , saddles or centers .",
    "one can compute the stretching fields of the flow to probe the mixing properties of the turbulent system @xcite .",
    "there are many more analysis ideas that follow along these lines and that take advantage of being able to measure the dynamics of fluid quantities moving with a fluid parcel .",
    "the opportunities are numerous and will help elucidate the mechanisms for turbulence and transport in 2d turbulence .",
    "further , the concepts and analysis that can be applied to 2d data will set the stage for similar applications to 3d data when it becomes available .",
