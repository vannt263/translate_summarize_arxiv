    "localization of a photonic mode by disorder in a statistically uniform and isotropic medium has been studied for more than two decades  @xcite , both in the optical and microwave spectral ranges . in this paper",
    "we propose and demonstrate a new mechanism for disorder induced strong three dimensional ( 3d ) localization of light .",
    "we achieved this in planar microcavities ( pmcs ) , containing a layer of strain - induced self - assembled quantum dots ( qds )  @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of light in the pmc plane is modified by the distributed bragg reflectors ( dbrs ) that trap the modes in perpendicular direction to the cavity plane .",
    "the qds constitute an active material which , under proper excitation , emits photons , due to recombination of qd confined excitons  @xcite .",
    "randomness in the qds in - plane position , composition and sizes produces fluctuations in the system s dielectric constant .",
    "this randomness provides the necessary `` attractive potential '' , which , together with the modified dispersion , brings about strong photon localization in the pmc plane .",
    "our novel mechanism differs from previous studies , since it provides genuine disorder - induced localization rather than leaky ( resonant ) modes  @xcite .",
    "it also differs from the `` transverse localization ''  @xcite , where the wave freely propagates in one direction while being trapped , by disorder , in the transverse direction  @xcite .",
    "we directly demonstrate the 3d localization of the photonic modes by measuring their photoluminescence ( pl ) intensity distribution .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize from the start that the comparatively small size of the excitation spot ( @xmath0 , or smaller ) plays a crucial role in the interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "the point is that _ in the absence of disorder _ the shape of the pl spectrum emerging from the cavity is quite sensitive to the size of the excitation spot . if the size is sufficiently small , the pl spectrum becomes very narrow , in marked difference with the broad shoulder predicted by the standard basic cavity physics. if there had been no disorder , the experimental conditions of our paper would have resulted in an extremely narrow pl peak .",
    "the significant broadening of the spectrum , as observed in our experiment , is due entirely to disorder .",
    "the broadening occurs both towards frequencies below and above the cavity frequency ( localized and resonant photonic modes , respectively ) .",
    "all this will be discussed in detail in the theoretical part of the paper .",
    "our sample was grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a [ 1,0,0 ] oriented gaas substrate .",
    "the sample consists of a pmc formed by a gaas one - wavelength resonator , sandwiched between dbrs made from 23(26 ) top ( bottom ) alternating gaas and alas quarter - wavelength - layer pairs . as an active material in the resonator s anti - node ,",
    "a single strain - induced self - assembled in@xmath1ga@xmath2as qds layer with average density of 5@xmath3 qds per @xmath4 is used  @xcite . the use of such composition results in large and asymmetric qds with typical lengths and widths of about 100 and 30 nm respectively , as can be seen in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : one]a .",
    "we used two methods to study the pmc .",
    "a ) a diffraction limited confocal optical scanning microscopy ( a @xmath560 objective with numerical aperture of 0.85 , obtaining spatial resolution of @xmath6 ) .",
    "b ) a near field scanning optical microscopy ( nsom- nanonics cryoview @xmath7 with spatial resolution of @xmath8 ) . by applying either method we measure the lateral distribution of the electromagnetic field above the sample surface .",
    "two modes of excitation were used . in the first",
    ", the excitation was focused to a diffraction limit by the collecting objective  @xcite . in the second ( the only one used for nsom ) , the excitation was focused at an oblique angle to a spot diameter of about 30 @xmath9 . due to the high energy used for the excitation ( 632.8 nm light of a hene laser ) the images produced by the two excitation modes were almost identical . in fig .",
    "[ fig : one]a we present pl spectrum ( upper , black solid line ) from a single point on the surface of the pmc sample together with a pl spectrum which was taken from the same sample ( lower , solid blue line ) after the upper dbr mirror was completely etched .",
    "the spectrally broad blue pl line is centered at 1.33 ev and has full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of approximately 10 mev .",
    "this spectral line results from s - shell electron - hole recombination within the inhomogeneous population of qds of various sizes and compositions .",
    "the radiative linewidth of a qd is @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "= .52    the rather symmetrical shape of the spectral line indicates that charge carriers are not distributed thermally between the qds .",
    "therefore , it is quite safe to assume that the spectrum accurately represents the actual energy distribution of the emission from individual qds .",
    "the spectrally sharp pl line in the figure is centered at 1.319 ev and has fwhm of 80 @xmath11ev .",
    "as we explain below , in a disorder free pmc this line width should have been about an order of magnitude narrower due to the finite excitation area and diffraction limited collection spot .",
    "the asymmetric spectral shape of the line and its actual linewidth which represents a q - factor of @xmath1215000 , in similarity to earlier measurements  @xcite , are due to the disorder in the dielectric constant as we quantitatively show below .    in the left inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : one]a we present on a semi logarithmic scale a spatially integrated ( ` far field ' ) pl spectrum from a 135@xmath9 wide @xmath13 long area on the sample s surface .",
    "the spectrum was obtained by summing up large number of individual pl spectra , each obtained from a diffraction limited areal spot .",
    "the dominating spectral feature is a large , asymmetrically broadened line around the energy of the pmc mode .",
    "the line decays exponentially towards lower energies with a characteristic energy of @xmath14 . towards higher energies the line decays with a characteristic energy of @xmath15 .",
    "the ratio between these characteristic energies agrees well with the prediction of our theoretical model for the disorder in the dielectric constant ( see below ) .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : one]b-[fig : one]d selective wavelength images of the scanned area are presented .",
    "the spectral domains which are used for each image are indicated by the green zones imposed on the far field spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : one]a . the image in fig .",
    "[ fig : one]b is obtained within a 0.5 mev energy window containing the pmc mode .",
    "it shows almost evenly distributed emission from the surface . in contrast , the image in fig .",
    "[ fig : one]c , which is obtained within a 0.5 mev window , 1 mev below the pmc mode , shows emission emerging from randomly distributed spots on the surface .",
    "likewise , the image in fig .",

    "[ fig : two ] we turn our attention to one of the low energy electromagnetic modes seen in fig .  [ fig : one]d . such localizing centers were observed in various mode energies and various locations on the sample surface . in the right panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : two]a-[fig : two]e , we display selective wavelength images obtained by scanning the aluminum coated fiber tip of our nsom microscope in tapping mode over the sample surface . the corresponding spectra in the left panels , are obtained from the brightest area pixels indicated by the + signs on the images . the green areas on the spectra indicate the spectral domains used for generating these images .",
    "these spectra and corresponding images reveal the following observations : four different localized photonic modes are observed at energies below that of the pmc mode . each mode is composed of two cross linearly polarized equally intense components ( not shown ) . the components are @xmath16 apart and the lower energy one is polarized along the [ 0,-1,1 ] direction  @xcite .",
    "the lowest energy mode is about 5 mev below the energy of the pmc mode .",
    "the in - plane spatial intensity distribution of this mode , as depicted by the image in fig .",
    "[ fig : two]a , is node - less , and has an elongated shape oriented along the [ 0,-1,1 ] crystallographic direction , along which the qds are also elongated ( see inset to fig .  [ fig : one ] ) .",
    "the mode dimensions are roughly 3@xmath52@xmath17 .",
    "the peak intensity is about 40 times stronger than that of the pmc mode .",
    "the next three images in fig .",
    "[ fig : two]b , c and d , present elongated spatial intensity distributions composed of one , two and three nodes , respectively .",
    "each mode s energy is @xmath121.5 - 2 mev higher than the energy of the preceding mode . the selective wavelength image in fig .",
    "[ fig : two]e is obtained at an energy window , which resides on the higher energy side of the pmc mode .",
    "it displays evenly distributed emission from everywhere except from the actual locus of the localized modes , where extended modes are forbidden .",
    "the magnitude and shape of the spot from which emission at this wavelength is missing is an estimate for the spatial extent of the region which localizes the optical modes .",
    "the region is comparable in shape and size to the most localized , lowest energy mode .",
    "the localized modes are insensitive to temperature and excitation density variations , hence they do not result from thermal or non - linear effects .",
    "the emission is linear with the excitation density between 1-@xmath18 watt/@xmath19 .",
    "increasing the temperature from 10 to 80k results in a small , rigid , red spectral shift , as expected from the temperature dependence of the material bandgap .",
    "since the sizes of the spots in fig .",
    "2b-2d significantly exceed the size of an individual qd , the only way to account for the experimental observations is to assume that each spot corresponds to a _ localized _ electromagnetic mode .",
    "therefore the low frequency tail of the pl spectrum in fig .",
    "1a should be interpreted as a tail of localized modes with energies below that of the pmc mode , @xmath20 , similar to the tail of localized electron states formed below the band - edge due to disorder  @xcite . to demonstrate how the presence of a cavity leads to the in - plane trapping ,",
    "we consider the scalar wave equation corresponding to the frequency @xmath21 : [ eq : one1 ] d^2dz^2 + ^2 _ + ^2 c^2 = 0 , where @xmath22 is a uniform dielectric constant inside the cavity , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the perturbation due to the randomly positioned qds that reside in a narrow layer , of width @xmath25 nm , in the middle of the cavity .",
    "let us emphasize that an individual qd is much too small to be able to trap a photon . actually , in the continuum description employed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : one1 ] ) individual qds are not resolved . what matters are the fluctuations in the areal density of the qds , which manifest themselves in fluctuations of the dielectric constant @xmath26 .",
    "since the electromagnetic modes are confined in the @xmath27-direction to a much shorter length than in the plane , the function @xmath28 can be factorized as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the cavity width , and @xmath31 satisfies the equation [ eq : two1 ] - c^2 ^2 _ - ^2 ( ) = - _ 0 ( _ c^2 - ^2 ) . in this equation",
    ", @xmath32 is the effective in - plane fluctuation of the dielectric constant obtained from @xmath33 by averaging over the @xmath27-distribution of the cavity mode intensity , namely , @xmath34 .",
    "the analogy between eq .",
    "( [ eq : two1 ] ) and the schrdinger equation makes it clear that , for positive @xmath35 , eq .  ( [ eq : two1 ] )",
    "admits localized solutions , with frequency @xmath21 smaller than the cavity frequency @xmath36 .",
    "thus , even a small enhancement in @xmath35 acts as an attractive potential localizing the mode laterally . to substantiate that this mechanism of trapping is relevant to our experimental observations ,",
    "we note that the spatial intensity distributions and the energies of the modes in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] are quite accurately fitted by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : two1 ] ) using a one dimensional parabolic model @xmath37 $ ] , @xmath38 describing a local fluctuation in the dielectric constant ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : two]e , right panel , where the best fitted values are @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "this agreement , and the fact that even in the case of the most localized modes , differently polarized components have almost the same energy , justifies the use of the scalar approximation .    to find the shape of the tail of the localized modes distribution , we have to specify the disorder `` potential '' , @xmath41 .",
    "the simplest possible model is the `` white - noise potential '' which amounts to treating the qds as point - like resonant units , randomly distributed in the plane ( this simple model does not describe the anisotropy observed in the inset of fig .",

    "this value should be multiplied by @xmath52 , which is the ratio of the qds layer width ( 5 nm ) to the cavity width ( @xmath12300 nm ) .",
    "there is an extra factor of 2 , since the qds are located at the anti - node of the pmc mode .",
    "thus , the effective enhancement , due to the presence of inas , is @xmath53 .",

    "let us consider now photons which exit at an angle @xmath93 , from some small collection spot .",
    "it is important to realize that there is a correlation between the angle @xmath93 and the average distance @xmath110 ( measured from the collection spot ) at which the corresponding photons have been created .",
    "indeed , a typical photon will bounce @xmath111 times before escaping the cavity .",
    "therefore photons that bounce at angle @xmath93 and escape at the collection spot must be created at a distance [ l_theta ] l ( ) ~t^-1 d .",
    "thus , the finite size of an _ excitation _ area can serve as an efficient cutoff for a maximal escape angle @xmath112 . assuming a circular excitation area , of radius @xmath113 , and choosing a small collection spot at the center of the circle ,",
    "one finds a maximal escape angle [ theta_m ] _ m = .",
    "of course , this relation is valid only if @xmath112 ( and therefore @xmath113 ) is not too large , namely , it should be smaller than the maximal escape angle for a fully excited cavity .",
    "since the angular cutoff translates into a frequency cutoff @xmath114 ( see eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) ) , we arrive at the important conclusion that the frequency range of the collected photons can become very narrow , if the excitation area is small enough . in our experiment @xmath115 , @xmath116 , so that the collected radiation constitutes a narrow peak at near @xmath20 , of relative width [ peak_width ] = = ( ) ^2 110 ^ -5 . obviously , this peak can be replaced by a @xmath57-function [ i0 ] i()=i_0(- _ c ) .",
    "qualitatively , the meaning of eq .",
    "( [ i0 ] ) is that , due to the finite excitation spot , only the photons emitted normally to the mirror emerge outside the cavity .",
    "quantitatively we note that the relative width of the experimentally measured pmc mode ( @xmath117 ) is about an order of magnitude wider than the one calculated by eq .",
    "( [ peak_width ] ) . as we show below , this broadening and the actual spectral shape of the pmc mode , results from the disorder .",
    "the replacement of the step - like spectrum of the _ clean _ cavity ( for infinite excitation spot ) by the @xmath57-function eq .",

    "the dependence , @xmath88 , is still determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : five1 ] ) .",
    "however , in the domain @xmath119 , the @xmath57-peak for the clean cavity gets broadened due to scattering of _ extended modes _ by the disorder .    in the presence of disorder , the above reasoning , which is based on the ray picture ,",
    "is not applicable since _ all _ the solutions , @xmath120 , of eq .",
    "( [ eq : two1 ] ) corresponding to the eigenstates , @xmath121 , have components with @xmath122 ( in the ray picture they correspond to rays with normal incidence to the microcavity plane ) .",

    "( [ i1 ] ) is normalized @xmath127 thus , the disorder broadens the @xmath57-peak ( eq .",
    "( [ i0 ] ) ) without changing its area .",
    "note also , that the calculation of the spectral shape , @xmath125 , is formally reduced to the calculation of the spectrum of two - dimensional _ exciton _ absorption in the presence of a white - noise random potential .",
    "this calculation was done earlier in ref . , where the zero - momentum components of the _ exciton _ states were selected by the matrix element for light absorption  @xcite .",
    "it is also important to note that the spectral shape , @xmath128 , is a function of the ratio @xmath129 , where @xmath84 is the same characteristic frequency , ( eq .",
    "( [ omegat ] ) ) , which determines the spectral shape of the tail of the localized photon states .",
    "indeed , deep in the tail , @xmath130 , all the trapped solutions , @xmath120 , at a given @xmath131 are identical to each other , and eq .",

    "this way , the width of the emission spectrum was found to be @xmath137 .",
    "the overall spectral shape of @xmath125 was found in ref . by combining the normalized ( eq .",
    "( [ i2 ] ) ) low - frequency and high - frequency asymptotes .",

    "the calculated ratio between the high energy and low energy slopes is 2:1 in very good agreement with the measured ratio of  2.5 .",
    "while the white noise model is successful in explaining the initial drop of the density of localized modes , it can not account for the experimental data in the deeper tail , starting around @xmath139 ev and below .",
    "it does not explain the non - monotonic decay of the probability as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : one]a",
    ". it fails in predicting the observed multiplicity of confined modes which belong to the same localization region ( fig .  [ fig : two ] ) , and it does not explain the anisotropy in the electromagnetic mode shapes .",
    "the failure of the white noise model , for @xmath118 , is not surprising .",
    "indeed , when the mode frequency becomes smaller , localization of the mode becomes tighter .",
    "thus , various local features of the random potential - such as correlations in @xmath134 , the `` granular '' structure of the disorder and the inherent anisotropy of the system - become more important .",
    "obviously , all these features are not captured by the entirely featureless , universal white noise model",
    ".    proper account of these specific features of randomness might explain some of the data for the deeper @xmath21-tail .",
    "first , once correlations are introduced , the most probable deep fluctuation is no longer a fluctuation which captures one mode only .",
    "second , the probability of finding a localized mode common to two localizing centers , rather than to one , may prevail at a given energy below the energy of the pmc mode .",
    "indeed , localized modes between 1.317 ev and 1.318 ev always exhibit a spatial structure consisting of two bright spots separated by a dark region .",
    "this observation suggests existence of traps of a double - well shape .",
    "the origin of such traps , as well as the multimode traps in the deep tail ( below 1.316 ev ) , may be traced to the granular nature of the disorder .",
    "although , on the average , the qds are uniformly distributed , there exist configurations with several dots coming close to each other , within a distance of a dot size .",
    "such rare configurations constitute more efficient traps than the white - noise fluctuations and therefore dominate in the deeper tail .",
    "the clusters of qds are akin to clusters of potential wells in the lifshitz model of a disordered electronic system  @xcite .",
    "thus , anisotropic qd clustering , can account for the shape and multiplicity of the strongly localized modes in the deeper tail .",
    "we are unable to make quantitative predictions for the density and spatial structure of these modes , since no comprehensive theory exists .",
    "yet , we show that dielectric constant enhancement of order @xmath140 over distance of order @xmath141 , does account for the experimental observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : two]e ) .    in conclusion , we demonstrate disorder - induced trapped photonic modes in a microcavity with an embedded layer of qds . in the lateral in - plane direction",
    "the modes are localized by spatial fluctuations of the dielectric constant due to randomness in the location and composition of the qds .",
    "our theory emphasizes the universal features of the trapping mechanism : the necessary combination of mirrors in the vertical direction and the lateral disorder .",
    "the theory quantitatively estimates the characteristic energy by which the pl intensity decays below the pmc mode .",
    "since the non universal , system - specific details of the randomness are not accurately known , the spatial shapes and energies of the modes deeper in the energy tail , are qualitatively discussed only .",
    "in addition we show both experimentally and theoretically that if the size of the excitation spot is sufficiently small , as it is in confocal and near field scanning microscopy , the microcavity emission spectrum becomes very narrow , in marked difference with the prediction of the standard cavity considerations , which apply to uniform excitation .",
    "the disorder broadens this spectrum , as well .",
    "thus , we quantitatively measure and calculate the disorder induced broadening below and above the cavity mode frequency ."
