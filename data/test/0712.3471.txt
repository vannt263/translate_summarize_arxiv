    "since the early 70s , the asteroseismology group at the institute of astrophysics and geophysics of lige has been using an evolution code derived from the henyey code .",
    "this code has been continuously updated .",
    "nevertheless , with the progress of asteroseismology , it became clear that the frequencies and the stability of the oscillation modes were extremely sensitive to details of the model , which were unimportant for the computation of stellar evolution .",
    "a few years ago , it was thus decided to write a new code , meeting the specific requirements of our studies in asteroseismology .",
    "this code has been named _",
    "cls _ , the acronym of _ code ligeois dvolution stellaire_. it is still in an active phase of development .",
    "a number of persons have contributed and contribute to its development .",
    "the main objective of this effort is to have a versatile stellar evolution code producing models precise enough to be useful for studies in asteroseismology .",
    "we try to maintain a clear structure so that every user will be able to tailor the code to his own needs .",
    "cls has been developed on a gnu / linux system ( more precisely a slackware one ) .",
    "no effort has been made to port the software to another platform .",
    "it is written in fortran 77 .",
    "a few relatively standard extensions of the language provided by the gnu fortran compiler g77 have been used .",
    "a few scripts use the bash shell and the script building the makefile is a tcl script .    the present version of the code is numbered 18 .",
    "the code is not unique .",
    "as it is easy to customize , several versions of the code have been developed from the standard version , implementing different features needed by the works already realized or in progress .",
    "the most interesting of these will be included in the next standard version of the code so as to preserve its uniqueness .",
    "the features described below do not necessary belong to the standard version .",
    "after a brief reminder of the equations we have to solve , we describe the physical assumptions .",
    "two sections are then devoted to technical aspects and we end with considerations on the use of cls , a solar calibration and a brief discussion .    due to limitations in the physics already implemented , the present version of cls is not intended for the helium burning phases of the evolution .",
    "the quasi - equilibrium structure of a star is governed by the following equations ( we use well - known notations ) : @xmath0    in ( [ eq : dl / dr ] ) , the luminosity @xmath1 does not include the neutrino luminosity and the term @xmath2 denotes the rate of production of nuclear energy from which we have already excluded the neutrinos losses . in the same equation",
    ", the term @xmath3 deserves a comment .",
    "it hides a time derivative and governs the evolution rate when no significant nuclear energy sources are available , for instance in the beginning of the pre - main sequence phase .",
    "it reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the chemical potential of element @xmath6 and @xmath7 the number of moles per gram . in this expression , some people keep only the term @xmath8 @xcite , but this neglects the effects of changes in chemical composition .",

    "though it is possible to eliminate one of the ion abundances , it seems that keeping all the abundances ensures a better stability to the solving process .    in the standard version of the code ,",
    "three groups of elements are distinguished for the treatment of diffusion , hydrogen , helium and the metals .",

    "the inclusion of a diffusion process without mass loss leads to overabundances of hydrogen in the external layers . for solar models or stellar models with convective envelopes ,",
    "this effect is hidden by the mixture due to convection .",

    "the @xmath95 are equal for all points @xmath88 in the zone and equation ( [ eq : discnuclevol ] ) must be replaced by the discretized form of ( [ eq : chemevolconv ] ) . however a simple and direct discretization would produce unphysical discontinuities when a convective zone recedes by more than one spatial interval in one timestep .",

    "@xcite distinguishes three different strategies for a stellar evolution code to advance by one timestep .",

    "we could probably improve the rate of convergence by using an extrapolation of the last two computed models as first guess .      to guarantee the continuity of interpolated functions as well as their first derivatives",
    ", we use cubic splines . in 1-d ,",
    "continuity of the second derivative can be achieved with cubic splines . however ,",
    "this results in non - local and sometimes unphysical behaviour of the interpolating function .",
    "we prefer to be able to impose the values of the first derivative at the grid points , values that we compute locally ( involving only three points ) , and therefore we sacrifice the continuity of the second derivative . this interpolation strategy can be extended to more than one dimension in several ways .",
    "when interpolating physical data , affected by their inherent uncertainties , it seems that the choice between the different variants is unimportant .",
    "the interpolation is faster if the derivatives are stored with the values , but the tables occupy more space in memory .",
    "both strategies have been used in cls , we tend now to favour the gain in computing time .",
    "the grid of points of the model is adapted during the evolution in such a way as to limit the variations of different physical quantities from one point to its neighbours .",
    "the controlled variables are @xmath19 , @xmath12 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the grid of one model is obtained from the grid of the previous one , with addition or deletion of points so that the following rules are satisfied : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "a simple command allows the user to impose stricter or looser rules for the grid choice .    with the default rules , a 2  m@xmath80 model typically starts on the hayashi track with 700 points ,",
    "reaches the zero - age main sequence with 1150 points and keeps about the same number of points along the main sequence with local additions and deletions .",
    "the timestep is chosen small enough to ensure that selected physical quantities do not vary too much from one model to the next one .",
    "the controlled variables are the local values of @xmath97 , @xmath96 and @xmath1 and the central hydrogen abundance @xmath102 .",
    "the allowed maximum variations depend on the evolution stage and are read from a table .",
    "this strategy gives the flexibility to adopt less severe criteria for the pre - main sequence computation for instance .",
    "however , when the newton - raphson algorithm fails to converge , the timestep is halved .",
    "the user has the possibility to influence , in a certain measure , the choice of the timestep .    with no intervention of the user , a 2  m@xmath80 model evolution needs 125 steps for the pre - main sequence , 75 steps for the main sequence and 20 steps more for the second gravitational contraction .    however , for evolution sequences computed with diffusion , the timestep is effectively controlled by the necessity of convergence of the diffusion algorithm .",
    "when the luminosity of the star is mainly powered by the nuclear reactions , it is enough to give the chemical composition as a function of the mass , @xmath103 to characterize a model .",
    "the good model will not be far from the model obtained by solving the structure equation with @xmath104 .",
    "this is not true for our first model on the hayashi sequence . to characterize it completely",

    "when it starts , cls reads a command file , i.e. a succession of commands composed of a keyword followed by parameters , instructing the program of the task it has to perform : mass of the star , chemical composition , eos table , opacity table , convection parameter ,   cls supplies default values for the parameters not specified by the user .",
    "the basic user must just know how to write a command file to express his requirements .",
    "this is well explained in a _",
    "user s guide _ of ten or so pages .",
    "the next step in the use of cls consists in providing the program with new tables , such as opacities for a new metal mixture .",
