    "factorization of numbers into their prime factors is a hard non - polynomial problem for classical computers .",
    "it was shor @xcite who proposed a quantum algorithm which can solve the problem of factorization of numbers on a quantum computer with a tremendous speedup as compared to a classical computer .",
    "a practical demonstration of shor s algorithm has been carried out by factorizing the integer 15 @xcite , using nuclear magnetic resonance .",
    "however , quantum computers capable of implementing shor s algorithm for larger numbers have not been developed yet .",
    "several approaches to factorize numbers based on interference of multiple quantum paths have been proposed dowling , summhammer , merkel2006,mahesh , mehring , gilowski2008,bigourd2008,sadgrove2008,stefanak .",
    "those schemes do not use quantum entanglement and do not capitalize on quantum parallelism . as a consequence ,",
    "these schemes scale exponentially with the number of digits of the factorized number .",
    "this is in contrast to shor s algorithm which requires only a polynomial number of operations . nevertheless ,",
    "if the interference is implemented in a suitable way in a system , which does the factorization , then one can benefit because nature plays the role of a computer .",
    "as was pointed out by jones @xcite the proposed techniques for factorization based on gauss sums @xcite unfortunately do not provide useful methods to factorize numbers , because a precalculation of the factors is needed for the experiment . in spite of that",
    ", gauss sums would be useful if it is possible to avoid explicit precalculation stages of the algorithms .",
    "physical systems that can implement the gauss sums must be described by complex numbers . in the present paper",
    "we investigate how truncated fourier sum and its generalizations , like truncated gauss , kummer and exponential sums , could emerge from superposition of several oscillations .",
    "those sums can be used successfully to factorize numbers . due to the wide use of interferences and beats in optics",
    ", we shall keep our consideration close to optics and our examples are in wave optics too .",
    "however , the proposed implementation can be extended to virtually any physical system where superposition among several different oscillations appear , from the mechanical pendulum with several degrees of freedom , through the atomic and solid state systems and their analogs in quantum mechanics .",
    "in order to find the factors of a given number @xmath0 we use the following truncated sum : @xmath1where @xmath2 is an integer and @xmath3 is the number of terms in the sum .",
    "the argument @xmath4 scans through all integers between @xmath5 and @xmath6 for possible factors .",
    "the capability of the sum of eq .",
    "( [ truncated sum ] ) to factor numbers originate from the fact that for an integer factor @xmath7 of @xmath0 with @xmath8 , all phases in @xmath9 are integer multiples of @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , the terms add up constructively and yield @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath4 is not a factor , the phases oscillate rapidly with @xmath12 , and @xmath9 takes on small values . in this interference pattern , larger truncation parameter @xmath3 leads to better convergency . in principle ,",
    "already the first several terms of the sum are sufficient to discriminate factors from non - factors .",
    "depending on the coefficient @xmath2 in eq.([truncated sum ] ) we distinguish several important cases :    [ fourier , gauss and kummer ] @xmath13    the use of quadratic phases to factor numbers ( gauss sum ) has the advantage of fewer terms needed in the sum to distinguish factors from non - factors compared to the linear phase ( fourier sum ) , which is because of high quasi - randomness for the quadratic phase @xcite . in the very same way",
    "the kummer sum , and sums with nonlinear phases of higher order , has an advantage compared to the gauss sum @xcite .",
    "now we consider a system with @xmath3 different oscillation modes , with frequencies @xmath14 , phases @xmath15 and amplitudes @xmath16    @xmath17    using the superposition principle we can write the resulting oscillation as the sum of all oscillations : @xmath18 in the sum of eq .",
    "( [ result oscilation ] ) we can vary the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the time @xmath20 . in the next several sections we will show how truncated fourier , gauss , kummer and exponential sums could emerge when we fix three of the parameters for all oscillations , while changing the fourth parameter .",
    "first we consider the case when the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath14 , @xmath21 are equal for all oscillations in eq .",
    "( [ individual oscillation ] ) @xmath22thus the only parameter that is left not fixed in eq .",
    "( [ individual oscillation ] ) is the time @xmath20 .",
    "this can be easily realized in optics by interferometry , where the individual oscillations describe the electric field for the different arms of the interferometer as shown in fig.[four arms ] .    from fig .",
    "[ four arms ] and eq .",
    "( [ result oscilation ] ) we see that we have the following sums of electric fields in the detector@xmath23where @xmath24 is the phase accumulated in the @xmath12 arm of the interferometer due to the difference in travel time through each arm .",
    "suppose that each arm of the interferometer is with length @xmath25 the wave length of the light that we use in vacuum is @xmath26 and the corresponding frequency is @xmath27 , let the index of refraction in each arm of the interferometer is different and is denoted as @xmath28 .",
    "then the phase @xmath24 for the beam that travels through the @xmath12-th arm of the interferometer is given as@xmath29here @xmath30 is the time that light travel in the @xmath12-th arm of the interferometer to pass length @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the speed of light in that arm .",
    "the refraction index in arm @xmath12 of the interferometer is @xmath33thus @xmath34then the electric filed in the detector is @xmath35now if the index of reflection in the @xmath12 arm of the interferometer is @xmath36then @xmath37the detector registers the intensity,@xmath38various @xmath2 gives us a different type of truncated sum ( see eq .",
    "( fourier , gauss and kummer ) ) .",
    "the number that we want to factorize is @xmath39 the trial factors are @xmath26 .",
    "each time when the trial factor @xmath26 is a factor of @xmath40 we will observe a maximum signal in the detector .",
    "the number of the terms in the sum can be controlled by doubling the elements in the interferometer fig .",
    "[ four arms ] .",
    "the numbers that could be factorized in this way are of order @xmath41 .",
    "now we consider a train of pulses , where the delay of the @xmath12 pulse compared to first pulse is given as@xmath42here @xmath12 takes the values @xmath43 , while @xmath44 can be set as a unit of time .",
    "we consider the case when all pulses have equal amplitudes @xmath45 and equal frequencies @xmath46 .",
    "then the electric field for the @xmath12 pulse is given by eq .",
    "( [ individual oscillation ] ) and reads @xmath47let us make a different path way for every pulse in such a way that all pulses hit the same detector at the same time , this is equivalent to make @xmath48 at the place where all pulses collides .",
    "then the intensity that the detector registers is a result from the superposition among all electric fields , e.g the sum from eq .",
    "( [ result oscilation]):@xmath49where @xmath50 . if one chooses the frequency @xmath51 as the number that we want to factorize ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath52 as a trail factor ( @xmath4 ) , then eq.([intensity ] ) reduces to the sum from eq .",
    "( truncated sum ) .",
    "if we now consider a system that exhibits several oscillations with the same amplitude @xmath53 and the same initial phases ( @xmath54 ) , but with different frequencies @xmath14 , then the individual oscillations ( individual oscillation ) are described by @xmath55the resulting oscillation ( [ result oscilation ] ) is @xmath56where @xmath57 .",
    "we will observe beats when @xmath58 is a integer which could be used to find the factors of the number @xmath59 .",
    "one physical realization of the above idea could be a light with several high - harmonic generated frequencies brabec2000,gavrila1992 , chosen in the way that they present for example the odd terms in the fourier sum : @xmath60then in the detector the time of the detection play the role of the test factors and whenever there is a beat we observe a maximum of the signal , thus this time is a real factor .",
    "the last parameter that we can vary in eq .",
    "( [ individual oscillation ] ) is the amplitude of the individual oscillation .",
    "for example if we work with laser light we can use the different polarization orientations of the electric field .",
    "the electric field is a vector in the polarization plane , which can be described by complex electrical field .",
    "let us consider the case when we have a linearly polarized light pulse , which is split in several parts and each part passes different pathways through faraday cells as shown in fig .",
    "[ faraday cells ] .    applying different faraday rotation angles",
    "@xmath15 on each pathway and collecting all of the light at the same place ( at the detector ) the resulting electric field is the superposition:@xmath61where @xmath53 is the electrical field amplitude of the initial beam .",
    "the relation between the angle of polarization rotation due to the faraday effect @xmath15 and the magnetic field @xmath62 in a diamagnetic material @xcite is    @xmath63    where @xmath31 is the length of each pathway and @xmath64 is the verdet constant for the material @xcite . for the amplitude of the resulted electric field we have:@xmath65if we now have a magnetic field @xmath62 for the @xmath12-th faraday cell , which is given as : @xmath66then",
    "the intensity in the detector is @xmath67here the number that we want to factorize is @xmath39 the trial factors are @xmath68 .",
    "we have shown how the factorization algorithm based on truncated fourier , gauss , kummer or exponential sums emerges naturally from superpositions of classical light waves .",
    "we have proposed a number of simple implementations in optics .",
    "these implementations can be extended to virtually any physical system where superpositions of several different oscillations appear .",
    "the factorization algorithms discussed in this paper are classical algorithms and thus their complexity scales exponentially with the number of digits .",
    "if an extension of this algorithm exists in entangled quantum systems , then a quantum computing parallelism would be involved with an exponential speedup of factorization .",
    "the present solutions therefore could be the first step to an alternative quantum factorization algorithm to the famous shor algorithm .",
