    "with the successful launch in 1999 of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "@xcite came the opportunity to explore the x - ray universe with greater angular resolution and sensitivity in the  energy range than ever before .",
    "one of the primary goals of the mission is to perform surveys of the extragalactic sky at these higher energies .",
    "the longest _ chandra _ pointings thus far are the _ chandra _ deep field - north  @xcite and -south  @xcite , with 2  ms and 1  ms exposure times , respectively .",
    "these fields have explored faint sources , with many objects reaching below the luminosity range of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to include  normal \" galaxies .",
    "though the deep fields are pushing to lower fluxes than previously attainable , they cover only a small area ( @xmath4 deg@xmath1 each ) , and do not have good statistics for the flux range in which the dominant contribution to the  x - ray background arises . to get such statistics , a larger area of the sky",
    "must be covered by combining multiple _",
    "_ pointings .",
    "the _ chandra _ archive provides the opportunity to explore multiple , mid - depth ( @xmath5 ks ) exposures . in we presented the serendipitous extragalactic x - ray source identification ( sexsi ) program design , our x - ray analysis techniques and a catalog of over one thousand  sources , as well as some initial x - ray results and comparisons with previous work . with data from 27 archival _",
    "fields , sexsi is designed to focus on a large - area ( @xmath6 deg@xmath1 ) sample of x - ray sources in the intermediate flux range ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "our goal is to determine spectroscopically the redshift distributions and nature of hard ( ) x - ray source populations from which the bulk of the x - ray background arises .",
    "the campaign of single - color photometry presented here attempts a minimum depth for every field of @xmath8 , consistent with identifying counterparts for which classifiable spectra can be obtained with a 10-m telescope in a @xmath9 hour integration .",
    "this strategy maximizes the number of hard sources identified spectroscopically in our fields for our fixed observing campaign .",
    "other programs are also aiming to understand the x - ray source population at medium depth with degree - scale _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ surveys .",
    "examples of such surveys include hellas2xmm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the _ chandra _ multiwavelength project ( champ ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite presents a comprehensive list of the many ongoing x - ray background surveys .",
    "the sexsi program is unique among the _ chandra _ serendipitous surveys in concentrating on obtaining a uniform spectroscopic survey restricted to the hard source population .",
    "the champ , in contrast , is a comprehensive program of imaging and spectroscopy to follow - up both soft and hard sources in a large number of publicly - accessible extragalactic _",
    "the sexsi spectroscopic catalog will therefore contain a larger fraction of obscured agn than champ .",
    "eight of the fields are common to both surveys , and for one of these champ has published some spectroscopic followup @xcite . even for the common fields , sexsi plans deeper spectroscopy and should identify a greater number of hard x - ray sources . between the large number of distinct fields and the different focus for ground - based followup , the sexsi survey provides an essential complement to current surveys of the sources responsible for the x - ray background .    in this paper",
    ", we present optical @xmath3-band imaging of the sexsi _ chandra _ fields , as well as the methodology used to derive x - ray source identifications and a catalog of @xmath3-band counterpart magnitudes .",
    "in addition , we explore relationships between the x - ray flux , hardness ratio , and @xmath3-band magnitude . a third paper in this series ( eckart et al .",
    ", in preparation ; paper iii ) will include our optical spectroscopic results , with redshifts and classifications for @xmath10 of these objects , and a discussion of the luminosity distribution , redshift distribution , and composition of the sample .",
    "we have imaged the sexsi fields using the palomar 60-inch ( p60 ) and 200-inch ( p200 ) telescopes , the mdm 2.4-meter ( mdm-2.4 ) and 1.3-meter ( mdm-1.3 ) telescopes , and the keck  i telescope .",
    "much of the early optical imaging for this program was done with small field - of - view , single - ccd array cameras .",
    "for example , the p60 ccd13 camera has a 12.6@xmath1112.6  field of view .",
    "this requires several pointings to map a typical @xmath12  _ chandra _ field , making multi - color imaging very time consuming . since spring 2000 , both the p200 and mdm-2.4 have had large - format ( @xmath13 ) ccd cameras available , allowing us to cover nearly all of a _",
    "field in a single pointing .",
    "the p200 large format camera ( lfc ; * ? ? ? * ) uses the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) filter set ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while , for our mdm-2.4 8k camera @xcite imaging , we used johnson - cousins filters ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath3 , and @xmath20 ) .",
    "in each filter band , our goal has been to obtain images with a limiting vega magnitude of @xmath21 , the practical limit for obtaining counterpart spectra at the keck telescope in reasonable integration times .",
    "because the large - format cameras were not available for the first 1.5 years of the sexsi project , some fields are imaged only in @xmath3 band ( due to observing time constraints ) , while the fields observed later in the program generally have multicolor data .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we use only the @xmath3-band data .",
    "table  [ tbl : cameras ] summarizes the characteristics of the telescopes and imaging instruments used in this program .",
    "we reduced the optical images using standard techniques , relying upon iraf tasks for the preliminary steps .",
    "median - combined bias frames , taken the same night as the science data , were subtracted from the images . for flatfielding , we used either dome flats or sky flats generated by combining all the images from a night , including twilight flats , with min / max rejection to remove stars .",
    "we used standard techniques to mask out cosmic rays and bad pixels prior to combining data .    for astrometric calibration of most of the data",
    ", we used the dophot software package to locate all nonsaturated , point - like objects in individual exposures . comparing with the usno - a2.0 catalog @xcite",
    ", we then used the object - matching program starmatch ( by doug reynolds ) to both align the images before stacking and to obtain an astrometric solution for the final , combined image .",
    "the standard deviations of the astrometric solutions are generally @xmath22 in each axis .",
    "we reduced images using the same methodology for both the lfc data from the p200 telescope and the 8k data from the mdm-2.4 telescope , although slightly different suites of software were required .",
    "we relied upon the mscred package within iraf , designed for reduction of large - format , multi - array optical data from the kitt peak / cerra tololo mosaic cameras , following the informative reduction pipeline outlined by b.  jannuzi . for the lfc images this necessitated first changing the data into the requisite format using the lfcred package created by m.",
    "huntmph / lfcred . ] .",
    "we relied on a variety of methods to provide photometric calibration of the data , depending upon the conditions under which data for a sexsi field were taken . throughout ,",
    "unless otherwise noted , we refer our magnitudes to the vega - based system .",
    "if conditions were photometric , we determined magnitude zeropoints from @xcite fields observed the same night , at an airmass close to that of the field in question . in cases where a non - photometric image overlaps a photometric image from another night , we determined the zeropoint magnitude by matching the photometry of overlapping regions .    in cases where we obtained no photometric images of a field , we relied on shallow sky surveys to provide magnitude zeropoints .",
    "where available , we used @xmath15 photometry from the sdss first data release @xcite , converting from ab magnitudes to vega magnitudes with @xmath23 alternatively , we used the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite to establish the zeropoint .",
    "typical photometric calibration errors for this technique were 0.2 mag .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we make the assumption that the sdss @xmath15 and johnson - cousins @xmath3 filters are similar . convolving the respective filter transmission curves with the @xcite composite sdss quasar spectrum",
    "redshifted from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , we find that this assumption provides a @xmath26 mag systematic uncertainty in our photometry .",
    "performing the same exercise on the @xcite composite galaxy templates , we find systematic offsets @xmath27 mag for @xmath24 , with larger systematic offsets at higher redshifts .",
    "for example , the s0 composite template at @xmath28 has a 0.39  mag difference between the @xmath15 and @xmath3 vega magnitudes due to the 4000    break redshifting out of the @xmath15 filter .",
    "though imprecise , our assumption that the @xmath15 and @xmath3 filters are similar is adequate to establish the faint source limit of each image , and to plan spectroscopic observing runs .      for extraction of sources from our combined , calibrated optical images",
    ", we used the sextractor code of @xcite to generate catalogs for both the full optical images and for the smaller , central portions of each image .",
    "because they avoid the ccd edges where the increased noise leads to spurious sources , these latter catalogs are used to derive photometric depths .",
    "quoted magnitudes refer to the sextractor magbest , which usually reports photometry within elliptical apertures @xcite , but reverts to a corrected isophotal magnitude if a source is strongly contaminated by nearby sources .",
    "to determine limiting magnitudes for each image , we made histograms of the @xmath3-band source density in 0.5 magnitude bins .",
    "figure  [ fig : magcutoff ] shows an example histogram from sexsi field q2345 . for each sexsi field image",
    ", we compare the measured number counts @xmath29 to that derived by @xcite from deep subaru imaging of the _ hubble _ deep field - north : @xmath30 where @xmath29 has units of number degree@xmath31 0.5 mag@xmath32 . for @xmath3-band magnitudes in the range @xmath33 , @xcite finds @xmath34 and @xmath35 . converting our @xmath3-band photometry into the ab system with equation  1",
    ", we plot our measured number counts for each image with the published , deep - field fit ( see figure  [ fig : magcutoff ] ) . in order to derive a crude depth for our images , we compare our number counts in each 0.5  mag bin to equation  2 ( at bin center ) .",
    "limiting magnitudes are defined by the inter - bin flux where our number counts go from greater than 80% to less than 80% of the @xcite value : this provides an @xmath36 completeness depth for each image . by the nature of our algorithm , then , these limits are good to @xmath37 mag .    table  [ tbl : images ] summarizes the @xmath3-band optical imaging we have obtained for the sexsi fields .",
    "the average x - ray to optical offsets , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are discussed in   [ sec : matching ] below .",
    "we derived @xmath3-band galactic extinction for the central position of each x - ray image using the ned galactic extinction calculator . checking the variance of the ned extinction values across the _ chandra _ field of view , we find that the typical error on the extinction is @xmath40 mag .",
    "three of our fields , however , have significantly higher extinctions than the other fields , and thus have an uncertainty of @xmath41 mag in their extinction values for individual sources .",
    "these fields are flagged in table  [ tbl : images ] .",
    "approximately half of the sexsi fields were observed with a single , uniform depth image ; the other half rely on imaging from multiple cameras and telescopes over several observing runs .",
    "of the fifteen fields with a single optical image , six reach @xmath3-band depths @xmath42 , and ten reach @xmath3-band depths @xmath43 .",
    "the shallowest field , cl  0442 + 0202 , only reaches @xmath44 , while the deepest field , cl  0848 + 4454 , reaches @xmath45 . of the twelve fields with imaging from multiple pointings ,",
    "eight have sections reaching depths of at least @xmath46 .",
    "a histogram of imaging depth for each source is shown in figure  [ fig : depth_hist ] .",
    "we match x - ray and optical sources in several steps .",
    "the procedure is slightly different depending on whether there is one optical image or multiple optical images per _ chandra _ field .    for fields with a single optical image",
    ", we first identify the closest optical source within 4  of each _ chandra _ source position . excluding sources displaced by more than 1.5@xmath47 from the mean offset , we use these identifications to calculate a first estimate of the average offset between the _ chandra _ and usno astrometry . for the following iterations ,",
    "the search radius used to identify optical counterparts depends upon the off - axis angle ( oaa ) of the x - ray source : we use the larger of 1.5  and psf/3 , where psf is the full - width , half - maximum of the _ chandra _ point spread function at each oaa .",
    "again , we exclude sources displaced by more than 1.5@xmath47 from the mean as we iteratively correct the x - ray source positions .",
    "we continue iterating until the corrections to the offsets are less than the corresponding standard deviation .",
    "two to three iterations are typically required , with the biggest shift applied after the initial matching . as shown in table  2 ,",
    "the typical standard deviation on this astrometric correction is @xmath48 0.3 , comparable to the accuracy of the optical astrometry .    for fields with multiple optical images",
    "we modify this algorithm slightly .",
    "some images cover an area with few ( or one ) x - ray sources , which , if we were to follow the procedure described above , could lead to incorrect offsets and matches . instead , for a given _",
    "field , we first take each optical image and find the closest match within a 4  radius of all _ chandra _ source positions that fall within the image .",
    "we record these astrometric differences . for x - ray sources falling on multiple optical images",
    ", we use the data from the image with the deepest limiting magnitude . as before , we use this list of multi - image astrometric differences to calculate an average _ chandra _ to usno offset , again eliminating sources greater than 1.5@xmath47 from the mean offset . this astrometric correction",
    "is then applied to all _ chandra _ positions for the sexsi field considered . a second pass at optical identifications",
    "is then made with the oaa - dependent matching radius , using the larger of 1.5  and psf/3 .",
    "of the 998 sexsi sources with optical coverage , 655 used a 1.5  search radius , while 343 used the psf/3 search radius .",
    "we expect few false matches due to an optical source randomly overlapping the matching search area .",
    "the number of false matches per field depends upon both the number of x - ray sources detected in the _ chandra _ field , and the depth of the optical image .",
    "we tested several fields from table  [ tbl : images ] for false matches by finding the total area covered by the 1.5  radius search circles and multiplying that area by the optical source density .",
    "we find that for medium - depth x - ray and optical images , the number of false sources detected per field is generally less than one .",
    "for example , we predict 0.6 false matches for q2345 , 0.7 false matches for cl 0442 + 0202 , and 1.3 false matches for 1156 + 295 , where these numbers are for the 1.5  search radius sources only . for the 34% of the sources with larger",
    "oaas and thus larger search areas we expect a larger fraction of false matches , though still fewer than 3 per field for most fields . for example , we predict 1.3 false matches from the @xmath49  match radius sources in q2345 , 1.4 false matches in cl 0442 + 0202 , and 2.4 false matches in 1156 + 295 . for several of the fields , including the three example fields just mentioned , we shifted all x - ray source positions by 1 , producing a `` fake '' x - ray catalog , and ran the matching routine again with the average x - ray - to - optical offset forced to zero .",
    "this process , repeated with several different shifts of the x - ray source positions , gives a check on the number of false detections predicted above .",
    "for all of the fields tested the number of false detections are consistent with the values we calculate .",
    "our spectroscopic results are also consistent with this matching scheme and will be discussed further in paper iii .",
    "once matching is complete , we produce first - draft optical postage stamp cutouts for our entire hard x - ray catalog ( see figure  [ fig : postage ] ) .",
    "each stamp is centered on the astrometrically - corrected x - ray source position , and the size of the _ chandra _ psf - dependent search radius is shown by the ( centered ) solid circle . a dashed circle , located at the un - corrected _ chandra _ position , illustrates the need for this offset correction .",
    "arrows point to identified optical counterparts , while the absence of an arrow signals a non - detection . if the magnitude found by sextractor is fainter than the limiting optical image , we annotate the photometry with an asterisk . as in paper",
    "cl \" flag is added if a source is potentially within 1  mpc of a target cluster center .",
    "next we visually inspect postage stamps for each x - ray source , flagging sources with potentially inaccurate photometry as required .",
    "these flags , detailed in ",
    "[ sec : catalog ] , identify sources which either ( 1 ) have multiple optical identifications within the psf - dependent search area , or ( 2 ) are , or are near , a saturated source in our optical image .",
    "a final matching iteration is then done , excluding the newly flagged sources .",
    "we produce new optical catalogs and postage stamp cutouts , omitting stamps for the handful of saturated sources where counterpart magnitudes are drawn from the literature and the 65 sexsi sources that either lack optical coverage in our data or have an unknown limiting magnitude due to nearby bright - source contamination ( optical flag = 6 , see   [ sec : catalog ] ) .",
    "an example of six postage stamp cutouts is included as figure  [ fig : postage ] ; the entire catalog of postage stamps is provided in the online version of the manuscript .    for the 262 sources with @xmath50 , 160 ( 61% ) have identified counterparts , while for the 434 sources with @xmath51 , 291 ( 67% ) have identified counterparts , and for the 167 sources with @xmath52 , 124 ( 74% ) have identified counterparts .",
    "our total sample of 947 sources with unambiguous photometry ( no contamination ) identifies 603 counterparts ( 64% ) .",
    "in table  [ tbl : catalog ] we present the catalog of 1034 hard - band sexsi sources  the table is published in its entirety in the electronic version of the _",
    "astrophysical journal_. columns  1  7 present x - ray source information for easy reference , while the optical photometric data are presented in columns  8  15 .",
    "complete x - ray source information is presented in paper  i , table  4 .",
    "the x - ray source positions in table  [ tbl : catalog ] are corrected for mean optical to x - ray offsets .",
    "note that since the source names ( column 1 ) , identical to the source names in paper  i , are derived from the hard - band x - ray images , the refined positions of columns  2  3 will not exactly match those of column  1 ( though mean offsets are typically less than 1 ) .",
    "column 4 lists the off - axis angle ( oaa , _",
    "i.e. _ , the angular distance , in arcmin , of the source position from the telescope aim point ) .",
    "the  flux ( in units of @xmath53 ) and detection snr are shown in columns  5  6 , while column  7 gives the hardness ratio , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the counts cm@xmath31 in the  and  bands , respectively . here ,",
    "as distinct from paper i , we record the hardness ratio derived from the net soft x - ray counts recorded at the hard - band source position when there was not a significant soft - band source detected ( in paper i these cases are reported as @xmath58 ) .",
    "in addition , for a subset of these cases , when the soft - band counts recorded at the hard - band source position were less than twice the soft - band background counts , the @xmath59 is considered a lower - limit , flagged as such in the catalog , and set to @xmath60 , where @xmath61 soft - band background counts .",

    "column  9 is the @xmath3-band magnitude of the optical counterpart , with its error shown in column  10 .",
    "column  11 gives the limiting magnitude for the image from which the optical counterpart , or a lower limit thereto , was derived .",
    "column  12 lists @xmath62 in arcsec , where @xmath63 is the astrometrically - corrected x - ray source ra ( from column 2 ) and @xmath64 is the optical counterpart ra ; column 13 is the corresponding value for declination .",
    "column 14 , @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , is the x - ray to optical position difference , also in arcsec .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , the logarithmic x - ray - to - optical flux ratio ( column  15 ) is given by the relation @xmath67 derived from the kron - cousins @xmath3-band filter transmission function .",
    "column 16 presents the sextractor class_star parameter @xcite for basic star - galaxy separation , with values ranging from 0.0 for significantly extended sources to 1.0 for sources consistent with perfectly stellar psfs .",
    "the stellarity value of the 8 bright sources with optflag = 3 ( from the literature ) is set to 1.00 .",
    "we present the stellarity data with the caveat that the values should only be used for broad separation , for example , of sources near 0 verses 1 , but not for detailed quantitative analysis .",
    "note that for all of the optical counterpart data columns , special attention must be paid to the optical flag . for example , if the code is a 2 ( optical counterpart is not detected ) , column  9 describes a lower limit , columns  10 , 12  14 , and 16 have no data , and the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio in column 15 is a lower limit .",
    "we now discuss the results of the optical identifications of the hard x - ray source counterparts and how the counterpart properties relate to the x - ray properties . throughout this section ,",

    "* ) , sexsi detects a population of sources overluminous in the x - ray for their optical magnitudes .",
    "this population is found over the entire x - ray flux range sampled .",
    "two explanations have been commonly discussed to explain large values of @xmath72 : ( i ) extremely high - redshift agns that might have bright x - ray fluxes but faint @xmath3-band fluxes due to absorption from the lyman transitions of hydrogen along our line of sight , or ( ii ) heavy obscuration by material in the host galaxy . the latter interpretation for the majority of sources",
    "is supported by near - ir studies , which find a large fraction to be very red early - type galaxies at @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "in addition , a number of _ type  ii quasars _ , which would have similar properties , have been identified in the deepest _ chandra _ surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    by virtue of the large area surveyed ,",

    "many of these sources have @xmath76 , well within the reach of 8- to 10-meter class telescopes for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "these are brighter examples of the new x - ray overluminous population .",
    "deep survey versions of these sources are typically extremely faint  as an example , @xcite report on seven `` extreme x - ray / optical '' ( exo ) sources in the 2  msec _ chandra _ deep field - north ( cdf - n ) which , despite having extremely robust detections in the _ chandra _ data ( @xmath77 counts ) , remain undetected ( @xmath78 ) in the great observatories origins deep survey imaging of the cdf - n @xcite .",

    "these high @xmath82 sources provide a useful catalog for future infrared surveys .",
    "we also find a number of sources with very bright ( @xmath83 ) optical counterparts .",
    "the bulk of these sources ( 7 out of 8) are identified as stars in the literature .",
    "figure  [ fig : hfluxhist ] presents a histogram of the number of sources in sexsi and in the cdf - n  @xcite as a function of hard x - ray flux and split by @xmath3-band magnitude at @xmath84 .",
    "this magnitude was chosen to separate our sources approximately in half . the small number of sources from images with @xmath85 were not included in this plot or in figures  [ fig : hrhist ] ,  [ fig : meanhr ] , and  [ fig : fxfohr ] .",
    "the majority of the sexsi sources have @xmath86 , a flux level that lies between the _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ sensitivity limits and the _ chandra _ deep survey capability .",
    "this important flux range corresponds to the regime in which the  relation changes slope and from which the bulk of the  x - ray background arises @xcite . compared to the deep surveys , sexsi has nearly an order of magnitude more sources at this x - ray depth , approximately half of which have @xmath87 , making them easy spectroscopic targets for 8- to 10-meter class telescopes .",
    "figure  [ fig : hrhist ] shows the hardness ratio histogram of the sexsi sources , again split at @xmath84 .",
    "the optically - brighter sources are peaked at a low hardness ratio , while the fainter sources have a much harder , and broader , distribution , showing that the optically - fainter portion of the sample has a higher fraction of sources with a flat x - ray spectral slope .",
    "the large peak of the @xmath88 sources is near @xmath89 , which corresponds to a power - law photon index ( @xmath90 ) between 1.8 and 1.9 , a typical value for unobscured broad - line agn .",
    "this suggests that the majority of the optically - brighter sources are broad - lined agn .",
    "spectroscopic followup ( paper iii ) will be able to specifically address this hypothesis .",
    "the harder and broader distribution of the @xmath91 sources indicates that obscuration at the source is likely involved .",
    "@xcite  shows a similar trend in the 1 ms cdf - n data .",
    "figure  [ fig : meanhr ] , which displays the mean hardness ratio as a function of hard - band flux separately for bright and faint counterpart magnitudes , again emphasizes that distinct populations are contributing to the overall source counts .",
    "the mean values for this figure are calculated using source @xmath59s regardless of if they are flagged as lower limits .",
    "setting all such flagged sources to the upper extreme , @xmath92 , shifts the points only slightly , if at all . for reference , the @xmath59 of a @xmath93 spectrum with varying intrinsic absorbing column density and redshift",
    "is presented in the adjacent panel .",
    "this shows that modest - redshift , heavily - obscured sources produce the highest @xmath59s . for sources fainter than @xmath84 ,",
    "the mean hardness ratio is essentially constant at @xmath94 over two orders of magnitude in x - ray flux . for those sources with brighter magnitudes ,",
    "however , there is a significant decline in mean hardness ratio , from @xmath95 at @xmath96 to @xmath97 at @xmath98 . in a simple - minded two - component model with median hardness ratios of @xmath99 and @xmath100 for the two source classes ,",
    "the faint sources are dominated by the hard population with perhaps an admixture of 10% soft sources at all flux levels , while for the brighter sources , the ratio of hard to soft sources changes from 20:80 at @xmath96 to 80:20 at @xmath98 .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the  relations derived in paper i , where we showed that hard sources follow a constant power - law over three orders of magnitude in hard - band flux , while softer sources show a distinct break at @xmath101 . in this picture , the soft sources are the standard , largely unobscured agn at all redshifts , while the harder component represents the lower mean - redshift , lower - luminosity populations revealed in the deep surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : fxfohr ] shows the hardness ratio as a function of x - ray to optical flux ratio for the sexsi sample , again with the @xmath59 of a @xmath93 spectrum with varying intrinsic absorbing column density as a function of redshift presented in the adjacent panel .",
    "the main plot shows a trend toward larger hardness ratios as @xmath82 increases .",
    "this is in general consistent with the notion that the increasing @xmath82 results from larger absorbing columns which attenuate the @xmath3-band flux much more severely than the hard x - ray flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting , however , that the most extreme sources with @xmath79 are not all hard , but exhibit a wide range of @xmath59s , implying that obscuration may not be the sole explanation for the dim optical counterparts .",
    "@xcite  find that for non - broad - lined sources ( e.g. , sources with optical spectra showing narrow agn emission lines or early - type galaxy absorption lines ) there is a linear correlation between @xmath72 and @xmath102 .",
    "this relationship implies that some of the high @xmath82 sources with low @xmath59s are high luminosity , high redshift , narrow - lined agn .",
    "we also explored the optical source densities in the vicinity of the x - ray sources .",
    "for each optical counterpart , we counted the number of sources in the surrounding region and compared the source density to the overall field density to calculate overdensities .",
    "we employed 20 , 30 , 40 , and 60  radius circles around each optical counterpart and counted sources with @xmath3-magnitude of @xmath103  and @xmath104  for each of the sources .",
    "we found no significant overdensities around the x - ray sources .",
    "we present @xmath3-band imaging of  @xmath105% of the  x - ray sources in the sexsi survey .",
    "we describe our optical data reduction and the x - ray to optical source matching algorithms employed , and present a catalog of @xmath3-band counterpart photometry and astrometry .",
    "while the power of the sexsi sample is fully realized only with the addition of our collection of optical counterpart spectra , the photometric identification of the sources is an important step that provides clues to the composition of the source population .",
    "we find that by splitting the sources at @xmath84 and analyzing each group s x - ray properties , we begin to see the emergence of what appear to be physically distinct populations .",
    "for example we find that the hardness ratio distribution of the optically brighter sources is sharply peaked near @xmath106 , typical of unobscured agn , while the fainter , @xmath91 sources have a much broader and harder spectral distribution .",
    "the findings of this paper suggest that the analysis of optical spectral data from counterparts fainter than @xmath84 ( attainable with 10-meter - class telescopes ) , will be an essential part of exploring the x - ray background composition .",
