    "recently , there has been a lot of interest in cosmological solutions in the presence of a cosmological constant , when the latter is significant compared to the present total energy density of the universe .",
    "indeed , the hubble diagram based on observations of type ia supernovae up to a redshift @xmath1 seems to imply that our universe is presently accelerating @xcite .",
    "these data , when combined with the observed location of the first acoustic peak of the cmb temperature fluctuations , favor a spatially flat universe whose energy density is dominated by a `` cosmological constant''-like term .",
    "the flatness of the universe is corroborated by the latest boomerang and maxima data @xcite , in accordance with the inflationary paradigm , though a marginally closed universe is still allowed by the position of the first acoustic ( doppler ) peak at @xmath2 .",
    "a significant cosmological constant may help in resolving the dark matter problem",
    "  for dustlike matter alone observations seem to imply @xmath3   and in reconciling flat cold dark matter ( cdm ) models with observations in the framework of @xmath4cdm models .",
    "finally , a cosmological constant is an elegant way to allow a high hubble constant @xmath5 with @xmath6 and a sufficiently old universe @xmath7gyr @xcite ( see also , e.g. , @xcite for a recent comprehensive review and references therein ) .    therefore , this interpretation , if confirmed by future observations , constitutes a fundamental progress towards the solution of the dark matter problem and the formation of large - scale structure in the universe out of primordial fluctuations generated by some inflationary model .",
    "that is certainly what makes it so appealing and gives it , maybe somehow prematurely , the status of new paradigm .",
    "a striking consequence for our universe is then its present acceleration , for a large range of equations of state @xcite .",
    "of course , from the point of view of particle physics , a pure cosmological constant of the order of magnitude @xmath8 , interpreted as the vacuum energy , is extremely problematic .",
    "this is why attempts were made to find some alternative explanation to the origin of the acceleration under the form of some scalar field @xmath9 ( sometimes called quintessence @xcite , `` @xmath4''-field , etc . )",
    "whose slowly varying energy density would mimic an effective cosmological constant .",
    "this is very reminiscent of the mechanism producing the inflationary phase itself with the fundamental difference that this scalar field , which does not have to be _ a priori _ the inflaton , is accelerating the expansion today , therefore at a much lower energy scale .",
    "this of course has problems of its own as this effective cosmological constant term started dominating the universe expansion only in the very recent past ( the so - called `` cosmic coincidence '' problem ) .",
    "indeed , the energy density of the field @xmath9 must remain subdominant at very early stages and come to dominate in the recent past only .",
    "hence , specific evolution properties are required to meet these constraints and were indeed shown to hold for particular potentials , partly alleviating the problem of the initial conditions . for inverse power - law potentials the energy density of the scalar field",
    "was shown to decrease less rapidly than the background energy density so that it can be negligible in the early universe and still come to dominate in the recent past @xcite . for exponential potentials ,",
    "@xcite the scalar field energy density has the very interesting behavior that it tends to a fixed fraction of the total energy density , these are the so - called `` tracker solutions '' .",
    "hence a pure exponential potential is excluded if data confirm that the energy density of the scalar field is dominating today , as this fraction had to be small at the time of nucleosynthesis .",
    "a slightly different potential is proposed in @xcite and a classification of the scaling behavior of the scalar field for various potentials has been given in @xcite .",
    "hence , though a minimally coupled scalar field is an attractive possibility , some degree of fine tuning still remains in the parameters of the potential @xcite .",
    "if one admits that it is some minimally coupled scalar field which plays the role of an effective cosmological constant while gravity is described by general relativity , the question immediately arises : what is the `` right '' potential @xmath10 of this scalar field ? in a recent work by starobinsky @xcite , the following `` phenomenological '' point of view was adopted : instead of looking for more or less well motivated models , like the interesting possibilities discussed above , it is perhaps more desirable to extract as much information as possible from the observations ( a similar approach can also be adopted to reconstruct the inflaton potential ) in order to reconstruct the scalar field potential , if the latter exists at all .",
    "cosmological observations could then be used to constrain the particle physics model in which this scalar field is supposed to originate . in the context of general relativity plus a minimally coupled scalar field , it was shown that the reconstruction of @xmath10 can be implemented once the quantity @xmath11 , the luminosity distance as a function of redshift , is extracted from the observations @xcite , something that is expected in the near future .",
    "can already be reconstructed from present experimental data , although not yet very accurately . ] the snap ( supernovae acceleration probe ) satellite will notably make measurements with an accuracy at the percent level up to @xmath12 .",
    "of course , in this way only the recent past of our universe , up to redshifts @xmath13 ( for reference , we will push some of our simulations up to @xmath14 ) , is probed and so the reconstruction is made only for the corresponding part of the potential .",
    "crucial information is therefore gained on the microscopic lagrangian of the theory through relatively `` low '' redshift cosmological observations .",
    "a further step is to generalize the same mechanism in the framework of scalar - tensor theories of gravity , sometimes called `` generalized quintessence '' .",
    "the usual minimally coupled models are certainly ruled out if , for example , it turns out that this component of the energy density obeys an equation of state @xmath15 with @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "strangely enough , such an unexpected equation of state which in itself implies new physics , is in fair agreement with the observations @xcite .",
    "also the inequality @xmath18 must hold for a minimally coupled scalar field , hence its violation would force us to consider more complicated theories , possibly scalar - tensor theories .",
    "there are also strong theoretical motivations .",
    "these theories , in which the scalar field participates in the gravitational interaction , are the most natural alternatives to general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "indeed , scalar partners to the graviton generically arise in theoretical attempts at quantizing gravity or at unifying it with other interactions .",
    "for instance , in superstrings theory , a dilaton is already present in the supermultiplet of the 10-dimensional graviton , and several other scalar fields ( called the moduli ) also appear when performing a kaluza - klein dimensional reduction to our usual spacetime .",
    "moreover , contrary to other alternative theories of gravity , scalar - tensor theories respect most of gr s symmetries : conservation laws , constancy of ( non - gravitational ) constants , local lorentz invariance ( even if a subsystem is influenced by external masses ) , and they also have the capability of satisfying the weak equivalence principle ( universality of free fall of laboratory - size objects ) even for a strictly massless scalar field .",
    "nevertheless , they can describe many possible deviations from gr , and their predictions have been thoroughly studied in various situations : solar - system experiments @xcite , binary - pulsar tests @xcite , gravitational - wave detection @xcite .",
    "finally these scalar - tensor theories could play a crucial role in the very early universe , for example in the pre big bang inflationary model ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in this work we are investigating the possibility to have an accelerating universe in the context of scalar - tensor theories of gravity instead of pure gr .",
    "this has indeed attracted a lot of interest recently and such cosmological models have been studied and possibly confronted with observations like cmb anisotropies , or the growth of energy density perturbations ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "however , we emphasize once more that the central point of view adopted here , in analogy with starobinsky @xcite , is to constrain the model with the _ experimental _ knowledge of the hubble diagram up to @xmath13 .",
    "this is precisely why use of the redshift @xmath19 as basic variable is crucial for our purpose : quantities like @xmath20 are directly observable , in contrast to , say , can be obtained from the knowledge of @xmath20 thanks to the relation @xmath21 $ ] , but the directly observable quantity is @xmath20 . ] @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "for instance , we have access to @xmath20 through the direct measurement of the luminosity distance in function of redshift @xmath11 .",
    "in a recent letter @xcite , it was shown that the knowledge of both @xmath20 and @xmath24 is sufficient to reconstruct the full theory ( again , in the range probed by the data ) .",
    "this means that we do _ not _ choose any specific theory _ a priori _ , but instead we reconstruct whatever theory possibly realized in nature .    as we will see , the knowledge of @xmath20 on its own , though insufficient in order to fully reconstruct a scalar - tensor theory unless one makes additional assumptions , turns out to be already very constraining when subclasses of models are considered .",
    "this is particularly interesting because it means that cosmological observations at low redshifts implying an accelerated expansion might well give new constraints on scalar - tensor theories .",
    "we will show that this is indeed the case .",
    "throughout the paper , we use natural units for which @xmath25 , and the signature @xmath26 , together with the sign conventions of @xcite . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the general formalism of scalar - tensor theories of gravity and their different parametrizations . in section iii , we briefly review the severe experimental restrictions imposed on these theories _ today_. in section iv , we consider frw universes in the framework of scalar - tensor gravity and we give the equations for the different parameterizations . in section",

    "vi , we give a detailed study of subclasses of models , which are investigated using the background equations . finally , in section vii , our results are summarized and discussed .",

    "@xcite , we used different conventions ( corresponding to the choice @xmath32 in the above action ) ; here , the quantity @xmath33 is dimensionless .",
    "this factor @xmath33 needs to be positive for the gravitons to carry positive energy .",
    "the action of matter @xmath34 is a functional of some matter fields @xmath35 and of the metric @xmath30 , but it does not involve the scalar field @xmath9 .",
    "this ensures that the weak equivalence principle is exactly satisfied .",
    "the dynamics of the real scalar field @xmath9 depends _ a priori _ on three functions : @xmath33 , @xmath36 , and the potential @xmath10 . however , one can always simplify @xmath36 by a redefinition of the scalar field , so that @xmath33 and @xmath36 can be reduced to only one unknown function .",
    "two natural parametrizations are used in the literature : ( i )  the brans - dicke one , corresponding to @xmath37 and @xmath38 ; and ( ii )  the simple choice @xmath39 and @xmath33 arbitrary .",
    "this second parametrization is however sometimes pathological .",
    "[ the derivatives of @xmath9 can become imaginary in perfectly regular situations ; see the discussion about eq .",
    "( [ positiveenergy ] ) below . ] in the following ,",
    "we will write the field equations in terms of the two functions @xmath33 and @xmath36 , so that any particular choice can be recovered easily .    the variation of action ( [ s_jf ] ) gives straightforwardly    @xmath40    [ 2.2 ]    where @xmath41 is the trace of the matter energy - momentum tensor @xmath42 .",
    "the scalar - field equation ( [ boxphi ] ) can of course be rewritten differently if one uses the trace of eq .",

[ in the brans - dicke representation where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , this factor @xmath47 reduces to the well - known expression @xmath48 . ] in the following , we will however use the form ( [ boxphi ] ) , which will simplify considerably our calculations .    the above equations are written in the so - called jordan frame ( jf ) . since in action",
    "( [ s_jf ] ) , matter is universally coupled to @xmath30 , this `` jordan metric '' defines the lengths and times actually measured by laboratory rods and clocks ( which are made of matter ) .",
    "all experimental data will thus have their usual interpretation in this frame .",
    "in particular , the observed hubble parameter @xmath49 and the measured redshifts @xmath19 of distant objects are jordan - frame quantities .    however , it is usually much clearer to analyze the equations and the mathematical consistency of the solutions in the so - called einstein frame ( ef ) , defined by diagonalizing the kinetic terms of the graviton and the scalar field",
    ". this is achieved thanks to a conformal transformation of the metric and a redefinition of the scalar field .",
    "let us call @xmath50 and @xmath51 the new variables , and define    @xmath52    [ 2.4 ]    action ( [ s_jf ] ) then takes the form @xmath53\\ , \\label{s_ef}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the determinant of @xmath50 , @xmath55 its inverse , and @xmath56 its scalar curvature . note that the first term looks like the action of general relativity , but that matter is now explicitly coupled to the scalar field @xmath51 through the conformal factor @xmath57 .",
    "quantities referring to the einstein frame will always have an asterisk ( either in superscript or in subscript ) , e.g. @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the covariant derivative and the dalembertian with respect to the einstein metric .",
    "the indices of einstein - frame tensors will also be lowered and raised with the einstein metric @xmath50 and its inverse @xmath55 .",

    ", one can deduce the relation @xmath64 with its jordan - frame counterpart .",
    "let us underline that the cauchy problem is well posed in the einstein frame @xcite , because all the second - order derivatives of the fields are separated in the left - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) , whereas they are mixed in the jf equations ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "action ( [ s_ef ] ) also shows that the helicity-2 degree of freedom is described by the fluctuations of the einstein metric @xmath50 ( whose kinetic term is the standard einstein - hilbert one ) , and that the ef scalar @xmath51 is the true helicity-0 degree of freedom of the theory ( since its kinetic term has the standard form ) . on the other hand",
    ", the fluctuations of the jordan metric @xmath30 actually describe a _ mixing _ of helicity-2 and helicity-0 excitations , and the jf scalar @xmath9 is related to the helicity-0 degree of freedom via the complicated relation ( [ varphi ] ) , because its kinetic term in action ( [ s_jf ] ) comes not only from the naive contribution @xmath65 but also from the cross term @xmath66 . in conclusion",
    ", the theory can be mathematically well defined only if it is possible to write the ef action ( [ s_ef ] ) , notably with its negative sign for the scalar - field kinetic term ( so that @xmath51 carries positive energy ) .",
    "if it happens that the transformation ( [ 2.4 ] ) is singular for particular values of @xmath9 , the consistency of the theory should be analyzed in the ef .",
    "some singularities may be artifacts of the parametrization which is chosen to write action ( [ s_jf ] ) , and may not have any physical significance .",
    "on the other hand , jordan - frame quantities may look sometimes regular while there is an actual singularity in the einstein frame ( a typical example is provided when @xmath33 vanishes ) . in this case , the solution should be considered as mathematically inconsistent . in the following",
    ", we will see that the jf is better suited than the ef for our cosmological study , but we will always check the consistency of our results by finally translating them in terms of einstein - frame quantities .",
    "the predictions of general relativity in weak - field conditions , and at present , are confirmed by solar - system experiments at the @xmath67 level @xcite .",
    "one should therefore verify that the scalar - tensor models we are considering are presently close enough to einstein s theory .    if the scalar field is very massive",
    "( say , if @xmath68 is large with respect to the inverse of the astronomical unit ) , its influence is exponentially small in solar - system experiments , even if it is strongly coupled to matter .",

    "if the scalar mass is small with respect to the inverse solar - system distances , it must be presently very weakly coupled to matter for the theory to be consistent with experimental data . at the first post - newtonian order ( @xmath71 with respect to the newtonian interaction )",

    "however , they can _ a priori _ differ significantly in the past .",

    "third , we write the equations for an arbitrary pressure of the perfect fluid describing matter in the universe",
    ". this will not be useful for our reconstruction program of the following sections , as matter can be assumed to be simply dustlike for the redshifts @xmath104 that we will consider , but these general equations may be interesting for further cosmological studies of earlier epochs of the universe . finally , we comment on the einstein - frame version of these equations , which are mathematically simpler , but actually more difficult to use for our purpose .",
    "we consider a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe whose background metric in the jordan frame is given by    @xmath105    [ 4.1 ]    where @xmath106 , @xmath76 , or @xmath107 for spatially open , flat , or closed universes respectively . the scalar field @xmath9 ( or @xmath51 , in the ef ) is also assumed to depend only on time .",

( [ generica ] ) , are natural in the sense that they can be approximated by the exponential of simple polynomials in @xmath51 . in that case , the observed value of the cosmological constant does not appear as a mere parameter introduced by hand in the lagrangian , but corresponds basically to the present value of @xmath387 . it should be noted that a value as large as @xmath388 is not excluded by the latest boomerang data , though it would be problematic in the framework of the inflationary paradigm .    in conclusion ,",
    "the existence of non - singular solutions over a long period of time is again the constraining input .",
    "a non - minimally coupled scalar field is essentially incompatible with ( [ h2gr ] ) over a wide redshift interval , unless the scalar field is frozen at a minimum of @xmath317 ( consistently with @xcite ) .",
    "if future experiments provide a hubble diagram in accordance with ( [ h2gr ] ) and also give a very small value for @xmath169 , it will be possible to conclude that scalar - tensor theories ( either non - minimally or minimally coupled ) _ can not _ explain in a natural way the existence of a cosmological constant .",
    "on the other hand , if the universe is closed and @xmath165 large enough , a `` quintessence '' mechanism in a scalar - tensor theory seems more natural than a mere cosmological constant .",
    "the above conclusions can be confirmed by starting from a given @xmath178 ( or @xmath325 ) , rather than @xmath33 ( or @xmath188 ) .",
    "we consider here `` scaling solutions '' , _ i.e. _ , we assume that these functions behave as some power of the scale factor @xmath389 .",

    "our aim is to reconstruct a regular potential @xmath130 from the knowledge of @xmath20 , assumed to be of the form ( [ h2gr])-([omegavalues ] ) .",
    "the strongest constraint on this class of theories is imposed by the solar - system bound ( [ df0 ] ) . indeed , using the definition ( [ alpha ] ) for @xmath136 , one can also write it as @xmath392 , and eq .",

    "if @xmath393 does not vanish , one finds that the scalar field needs to carry negative energy beyond @xmath400 . even without trying to reconstruct the potential @xmath130",
    ", one can thus conclude that such scaling solutions would be ruled out by the observation of a @xmath20 of the form ( [ h2gr ] ) up to @xmath262 .",
    "paradoxically , this result is valid even for an infinitesimal ( but nonzero ) value of @xmath393 .",
    "indeed , there exists a discontinuity between the case of a strictly constant @xmath96 and that of a scaling solution @xmath401 . at first order in @xmath393 , and still assuming @xmath164 , one can write eq .",
    "( [ 5.5 ] ) as @xmath402 this equation confirms that @xmath403 when @xmath404 , and therefore that the scalar field tends towards a constant in this limit .",
    "however , it carries positive energy ( @xmath405 ) only if @xmath406 since the right - hand side is estimated to be @xmath407 , the maximum value of @xmath19 is obtained for @xmath408 , so that the large numerical factor coming from @xmath409 in the left - hand side is compensated by the small term inside the second parentheses .",
    "working iteratively , this maximum redshift can be better approximated by @xmath410 , and the actual numerical resolution of equality ( [ psmallpositivee ] ) for the values ( [ omegavalues ] ) gives @xmath411 .",
    "therefore , even if @xmath393 is vanishingly small , a scaling solution @xmath401 can not be consistent with ( [ h2gr ] ) beyond this maximum redshift .",
    "this illustrates once more that the experimental determination of @xmath20 up to @xmath262 would be more constraining that solar - system experiments for this class of theories , provided one takes into account the requirement of positive energy .",
    "let us underline that the above value for @xmath282 is valid for a monomial @xmath412 but not for more complicated polynomial expressions .",
    "indeed , as shown for instance in sec .",
    "vi.b above , there do exist scalar - tensor theories consistent with ( [ h2gr ] ) up to arbitrarily large redshifts , and they do not need to be _ strictly _ equivalent to gr plus a cosmological constant ( although they must be close enough to it ) . moreover , the above maximum redshift is a consequence of the _ exact _ form for @xmath20 we chose in eq .",
    "( [ h2gr ] ) .",
    "a slightly different function may of course allow a positive - energy scalar field up to much higher redshifts .",
    "it suffices that the right - hand side of eq .",

    "the case of a spatially open universe ( @xmath297 ) is forbidden by eq .",
    "( [ eq.p ] ) , unless @xmath169 is smaller than @xmath415 .",
    "such a situation would be indistinguishable from the spatially flat case .    in a spatially closed universe ( @xmath295 ) , @xmath393 is given by the positive root of the second - order equation eq .",
    "( [ eq.p ] ) . remembering the solar - system bound ( [ df0 ] )",
    ", one may consider the case @xmath416 , and one gets @xmath417 .",
    "even if one considered values of @xmath169 as large as @xmath418 , this would limit @xmath393 to @xmath419 . therefore , in this case again , solar - system constraints impose that the scalar field should be almost minimally coupled , if one looks for such scaling solutions .",
    "the difference with the spatially flat case is that eqs .",
    "( [ f])([varphiprimebis ] ) can now be integrated for any redshift @xmath19 ( from future infinity , @xmath420 , to arbitrarily large @xmath19 ) .",
    "since @xmath178 needs to be almost constant , we recover solution ( [ parametricv ] ) for the potential @xmath130 . as in sec .",
    "vi.c.1 above , we can thus conclude that such models would be consistent with ( [ h2gr ] ) over a wide redshift interval only if they are ( almost ) minimally coupled , and they would provide a natural `` quintessence '' mechanism to explain the presently observed cosmological constant only if the universe is ( marginally ) closed .",
    "let us end this paragraph by a remark concerning scaling solutions , for which the scalar - field energy density scales like a power of @xmath389 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , they have attracted a lot of attention recently . for a minimally coupled field , the possible scaling behaviors and the corresponding potentials",
    "can be classified @xcite . as for a non -",
    "minimally coupled field , a subclass of theories was considered in @xcite , for which @xmath421 where @xmath422 and @xmath423 are constants . since , besides these two constants , there is only one unknown function of @xmath9 , the knowledge of @xmath20 suffices to reconstruct the full microscopic lagrangian from eqs .",
    "( [ f])([5.5 ] ) above . however , the main conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite can be recovered from a simple argument , without any numerical integration .",
    "indeed , it was shown in this reference that there exists a universal behavior of these theories , depending on @xmath423 but not on the precise shape of @xmath33 . as emphasized in @xcite , this result",
    "was obtained in the strong coupling limit , corresponding formally to @xmath424 in action ( [ s_jf ] ) .",
    "taking into account the assumed relation ( [ ufm ] ) , the class of theories under consideration is thus defined by @xmath425\\ .",
    "\\label{s_jfz0}\\ ] ] if we now introduce a new scalar variable @xmath426 , we notice that @xmath9 disappears totally from the action",
    ". no physical result can thus depend on the precise form of @xmath33 , and we recover the conclusion of @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath422 may also be set to 1 by a change of length units , and this class of theories is thus parametrized by the single real number @xmath423 .",
    "any physical prediction must therefore depend only on @xmath423 .",
    "in this work we have investigated the constraints that arise from the _ experimental _ knowledge of the luminosity distance in function of the redshift up to @xmath262 , corresponding to @xmath20 given by ( [ h2gr])-([omegavalues ] ) .",
    "in particular , our universe is then presently accelerating and we have studied the viability of subclasses of scalar - tensor theories of gravity .",
    "we have shown that the subclass of models in which the scalar partner @xmath9 of the graviton has no potential at all , and which satisfy the present - day existing constraints , are inevitably ruled out if an expansion of the form of eq .",
    "( [ h2gr ] ) holds even for a redshift interval as tiny as @xmath427 ( see the precise numbers in section vi ) .",
    "we see that these theories become pathological in the form of a vanishing @xmath96 , already at such low redshifts for which @xmath20 will be experimentally accessible in the near future @xcite .",
    "hence we show that a cosmological observation of the background evolution according to eq .",
    "( [ h2gr ] ) in the `` recent '' epoch will be enough to rule out such models .",
    "[ on the other hand , future observations might provide a @xmath20 which confirms the existence of a scalar partner to the graviton and rule out pure gr ! ] the main reason why we obtained so constraining results is that we took into account the mathematical consistency of the theory , _",
    "i.e. _ , the fact that it should contain only positive - energy excitations to be well behaved .",
    "this requirement severely restricts the class of viable models .",
    "a non - flat universe can alleviate in some cases the tight constraints we found .",
    "however , the latest cmb data released by boomerang and maxima @xcite favor a flat universe ( in accordance with the inflationary paradigm ) , and only a marginally closed universe is still allowed by the location of the first acoustic ( doppler ) peak at @xmath428 , while an open universe is more unlikely .",
    "the most impressive conclusion is that future cosmological observations may prove to be more constraining for massless scalar - tensor theories than solar - system and binary - pulsar tests . indeed , even if the determination of the luminosity distance @xmath11 will not reach very quickly the impressive accuracy obtained in the solar system or with binary pulsars , it will nevertheless give access to the full coupling function @xmath33 in action ( [ s_jf ] ) , or @xmath188 in the einstein - frame rewriting ( [ s_ef ] ) , whereas only its first two derivatives are presently probed .",
