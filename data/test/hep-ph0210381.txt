    "the investigation of the properties of mesons composed of a heavy quark and antiquark ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) gives very important insight into heavy quark dynamics .",
    "heavy quarkonia have a rich spectroscopy with many narrow states lying under the threshold of open flavour production .",
    "excited states experience different decays among which there are radiative transitions to lower levels .",
    "the theoretical analysis shows that many properties of heavy quarkonia , including mass spectra and radiative decay rates , are significantly influenced by relativistic effects .",
    "thus their inclusion is necessary for the correct description of the spectroscopy and the determination of quarkonium wave functions .",
    "radiative decays are the most sensitive to relativistic effects .",
    "some of these decays , which are forbidden in the exact nonrelativistic limit ( so - called hindered transitions ) due to the orthogonality of initial and final meson wave functions , have decay rates of the same order as the allowed ones . in the relativistic description of mesons",
    "an important role is played by properties of the confining quark - antiquark interaction , in particular its lorentz structure",
    ". thus comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental data can provide valuable information on the form of the confining potential .",
    "such information is of great practical interest , since at present it is not possible to obtain the @xmath8 potential in the whole range of distances from the basic principles of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "as it is well known , the growing of the strong coupling constant with distance makes perturbation theory inapplicable at large distances ( in the infrared region ) . in this region",
    "it is necessary to account for nonperturbative effects connected with the complicated structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "all this leads to a theoretical uncertainty in the @xmath8 potential at large and intermediate distances .",
    "it is just in this region of large and intermediate distances that most of the basic meson characteristics are formed .    at present , a vast set of experimental data is available on the masses and different decays of heavy quarkonia .",
    "however , not all states predicted by theory have been observed yet , while the others need confirmation .",
    "such missing or unconfirmed states are present both in charmonium ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) and bottomonium ( spin - singlet @xmath13 and @xmath14 states , @xmath4 states ) .",
    "the different possibilities for their experimental observation are proposed and widely discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "radiative transitions from the spin - triplet levels with @xmath15 to these states as well as their subsequent radiative decays play an important role in these proposals .",
    "the missing charmonium states can also be searched in @xmath16 meson decays and identified by their radiative transitions @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , reliable relativistic predictions for the masses of these states and for the rates of radiative transitions involving them are necessary .",
    "the properties of the @xmath0 meson are of special interest , since it is the only heavy meson consisting of two heavy quarks with different flavour .",
    "this difference of quark flavours forbids annihilation into gluons . as a result ,",
    "the excited @xmath0 meson states lying below the @xmath17 production threshold undergo pionic or radiative transitions to the ground pseudoscalar state which then decays weakly .",
    "there should be a rather rich set of such narrow states which are considerably more stable than corresponding charmonium or bottomonium states . the cdf collaboration @xcite reported the discovery of the @xmath0 ground state in @xmath18 collisions at fermilab .",
    "more experimental data are expected to come in the near future from new hadronic colliders .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a detailed analysis of mass spectra and radiative transitions in charmonium , bottomonium and @xmath0 mesons with the comprehensive account of the relativistic effects .",
    "this will allow one to get valuable information about the lorentz structure of confining quark interactions from the comparison of obtained predictions with available experimental data .",
    "on the other hand , it will indicate the processes in which the missing states can be searched for .",

    "<S> the mass spectra and electromagnetic decay rates of charmonium , bottomonium and @xmath0 mesons are comprehensively investigated in the relativistic quark model . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of only heavy quarks allows the expansion in powers of their velocities . </S>",
    "<S> all relativistic corrections of order @xmath1 , including retardation effects and one - loop radiative corrections , are systematically taken into account in the computations of the mass spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained wave functions are used for the calculation of radiative magnetic dipole ( m1 ) and electric dipole ( e1 ) transitions . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that relativistic effects play a substantial role . </S>",
    "<S> their account and the proper choice of the lorentz structure of the quark - antiquark interaction in a meson is crucial for bringing theoretical predictions in accord with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed comparison of the calculated decay rates and branching fractions with available experimental data for radiative decays of charmonium and bottomonium is presented . the possibilities to observe the currently missing spin - singlet @xmath2 and @xmath3 states as well as @xmath4 states in bottomonium </S>",
