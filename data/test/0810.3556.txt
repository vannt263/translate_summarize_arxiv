    "since its discovery @xcite , the black - hole candidate ( bhc )  has been observed to spend long periods in outburst . although historically it was found to be mainly in the hard state ( maejima et al .",
    "1984 ; ilovaisky et al .",
    "1986 ; miyamoto et al . 1991 ) , since the launch of   the source has been monitored and complete sets of transitions have been observed and studied ( belloni et al .",
    "2005 ; zdziarski et al . 2004 ; del santo et al . 2008 ) .",
    "unlike the bhc prototype cyg x1 , for which spectral state transitions are directly correlated with luminosity ,  shows hysteresis in its relation between x - ray luminosity and spectral state @xcite , as also observed in other bhc in low - mass binary systems ( lmxb ; maccarone & coppi 2003 ; smith , heindl & swank 2002 ) .",
    "it was observed that hard - to - soft state transitions during the rise phase occurs at higher luminosities than the soft - to - hard transitions during the decline phase ( smith , heindl & swank 2002 ; zdziarski et al . 2004 ) .",
    "_ cgro _ , _ ginga _ and  data from  collected in the period 1987 - 2004 have been analysed by zdziarski et al .",
    "these authors reported on long term variability and spectral correlations for the @xmath115 outbursts of  that occurred in this period .",
    "furthermore , in that work a lower limit for the source distance at 7 kpc was provided .    the 2002/2003 outburst ( smith et al .",
    "2002a ; nespoli et al .",
    "2003 ; buxton & bailyn 2004 ) was followed with  in detail through timing and hardness - ratio ( hr ) analysis @xcite .",
    "these authors described hysteresis in term of the source s evolution through a hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also introduced new definitions for the different sub - states observed during state transitions : the hard - intermediate ( hims ) and the soft - intermediate states ( sims ; see also homan & belloni 2005 ; belloni 2005 ) . for a description of historical and alternative states classification",
    "see tanaka & lewin ( 1995 ) , van der klis ( 1995 ) and a more recent review by mcclintock & remillard ( 2006 ) .    during the 2002/2003 outburst ,",
    "close to the transition to the sims ( on 2002 may 17th @xcite ) , a rapid ( hours ) bright radio flare was observed @xcite which led to the formation of a large - scale relativistic jet @xcite .",
    "fender , belloni & gallo ( 2004 ) associated this flare and subsequent matter ejections with the crossing of the so - called jet - line , i.e.  the hims - sims transition as reported by nespoli et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . during this hims - sims transition  showed fast changes in its timing properties , but almost none in the 3 - 20 kev energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "in february 2004 a new outburst started , which reached a significantly lower peak flux than the 2002/2003 outburst ( buxton et al .",
    "2004 ; smith et al .",
    "2004 ; belloni et al . 2004 ; kuulkers et al .",

    ", simultaneous  and  observations were made .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "( 2006 ) combined data from pca , hexte and ibis , and obtained good quality broad - band ( 3 - 200 kev ) energy spectra before and soon - after the transition .",
    "these spectra indicated steepening of the hard , high - energy component . also , the high - energy cut - off that was present at @xmath170 kev before the transition was not detected later .",
    "therefore , although spectral parameters at lower energies do not change abruptly through the transition , the energy of the cut - off increases or disappears rather fast ( within 10 hours ) .",
    "the power spectra before and after the transition showed significant differences ( see belloni et al .",
    "2005 ; belloni 2008 ) : from strong band - limited noise and type - c qpo to much weaker noise and type - b qpo ( for a description of the properties of different types of qpo , see casella , belloni & stella 2005 ) .    in 2006",
    "monitoring of  revealed low - level x - ray activity ( bezayiff & smith 2006 ; swank et al .",

    "2007a - e ) .",
    "we activated our campaign with the aim to follow the source through a hims - sims transition .",
    "unfortunately , we did not observe the main transition , as we did in 2004 , but managed to capture a secondary transition . in this paper",
