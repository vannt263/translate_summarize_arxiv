    "chiral symmetry , as one of the symmetries of qcd , is a key to understanding the dynamics of the strong interaction . in the real world",
    "chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , and plays a dynamical role in various scattering processes involving the nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "hadrons are then classified only according to the residual vector symmetry and the full chiral symmetry can be conveniently represented by the non - linear realization . yet , as pointed out by weinberg  @xcite , it still makes sense to talk about irreducible representations of the complete chiral symmetry group , and consider hadrons as mixtures of a ( small ) number of such chiral multiplets .",
    "if so , one can use the chiral symmetry as an algebraic symmetry that puts constraints on physical observables , such as masses and coupling constants . furthermore ,",
    "as chiral symmetry is restored at high temperature and density , the change in hadron properties can be viewed as a function of the change in the representation mixing .",
    "the present paper is based on this point of view , where we extend some previous work by christos  @xcite for @xmath6 , to include chiral  mirror \" nucleon fields , with a view to ultimately extending it to @xmath7 , where some pioneering work has been done in refs .",
    "so , this paper may be viewed , to some extent , as an intermediate pedagogical step on the way to the full - blown problem . yet",
    ", we shall see that this simpler @xmath6 case contains most of the features of the @xmath7 case , and that certain characteristic problems become clearer without the algebraic complexity of the @xmath7 case .",
    "it is , therefore , important to determine the starting point here , _",
    "viz . _ the chiral multiplets of bare hadrons , in particular of baryons , which are then mixed by the interactions to produce the physical / dressed hadrons .",
    "phenomenologically , the success of the quark model implies the dominance of three valence quark component in nucleon states .",
    "our strategy is therefore to choose nucleon chiral multiplets guided by the nucleon fields written in terms of three quarks .",
    "strictly speaking , in the broken symmetry world the chiral structure of the interpolating field is not identical to that of the physical state that is coupled to the field ; generally , the latter could be more complicated than the former . in this sense ,",
    "our choice of chiral multiplets is perhaps the simplest one consistent with qcd .",
    "the chiral multiplets associated with the lowest fock space components of the @xmath8 ( nucleon ) fields are @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for higher fock space components ( e.g. pentaquarks , septaquarks etc . )",
    "one finds chiral multiplets @xmath11 , @xmath12 etc .",
    ", all of which we shall ignore here .",
    "indeed we shall not even include the @xmath13 multiplet , which appears only with non - local three - quark interpolating fields .",
    "the classification of local three - quark nucleon fields into chiral multiplets has been recently worked out in ref .",
    "following up on this , we use the @xmath2 and @xmath14 chiral ( here and in what follows we shall refer to them as the abelian and the non - abelian chiral symmetries , respectively ) transformation properties of the two independent @xmath15 local nucleon fields to write down and classify the possible nucleon - meson interaction terms in the present paper .",
    "nucleon fields containing no derivatives are natural for the even - parity ground state nucleons ; in that case only the @xmath16 non - abelian multiplet is allowed by the pauli principle @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that there are two such linearly independent fields .",
    "their linear combinations form different (  opposite \" ) irreducible representations of the @xmath2 symmetry : one with the axial baryon number @xmath17 and another with axial baryon number @xmath18   transformation properties of one linear combination of the nucleon fields , but did not mention that it was an abelian  mirror \" assignment . ]",
    "we shall use these properties to classify the nucleon - meson interaction terms in the present paper .    for odd - parity nucleon excited states , on the other hand , fields with ( at least ) one derivative appear natural .",
    "once we allow for one space - time derivative to exist , we find nucleon fields with chiral properties that are opposite , or complementary , i.e.  mirror \" to the non - derivative  naive \" ones @xcite , e.g. the @xmath19 .",
    "this fact allows one to explicitly construct the interactions of the four different nucleon fields with chiral mesons that can account for both the masses and decays of the lowest - lying even- and odd - parity nucleon resonances .    as a specific example",
    ", we choose four particular nucleon fields , forming a @xmath2 chiral nucleon quartet , that we identify with the four lowest - lying nucleon resonances : the nucleon - roper even - parity pair and the @xmath20 and @xmath21 odd - parity resonances .",
    "we estimate the coupling strengths from the nucleon masses .",
    "our method applies equally well to any , and not just the lowest - lying , @xmath2 chiral nucleon quartet , i.e. , pair of nucleon parity doublets .",
    "it turns out that there are many allowed one - meson - baryon interaction terms , even in the limit of exact @xmath5 and @xmath2 chiral symmetries .",
    "this large latitude in the theory stems from the existence of cubic - meson - field interactions , first noticed by christos @xcite , which turn into one - meson - baryon interaction terms after spontaneous breakdown of the chiral symmetry .",
    "the existence of cubic - meson - field interactions , in turn , is a consequence of the existence of nucleon fields with the abelian axial charge @xmath18 .",
    "we shall show that this fact implies that one does not need explicit @xmath22 symmetry breaking terms due to the @xmath22 anomaly in the nucleon sector to describe the nucleon masses and decays : they can all be described without taking explicit @xmath22 symmetry breaking into account .",
    "this is in contrast with the case of purely linear - meson - field interactions , which requires some explicit @xmath22 symmetry breaking terms in the nucleon sector to describe the nucleon masses .",
    "consequently , the explicit @xmath22 symmetry breaking , or its restoration , do not need to have an impact on the nucleon resonance spectrum .",
    "note , however , that it is always possible to incorporate the explicit @xmath22 symmetry breaking effects by including e.g. the t hooft interaction in the mesonic sector , or even in the baryon sector of the lagrangian without  spoiling \" the pattern / ordering of baryon masses .",
    "this would not be the case if there were only one kind of nucleon field , i.e. , it is a consequence of the existence of two kinds of nucleon fields with different axial baryon numbers .",
    "it must be stated that a closely related study of the nucleon ground state and one resonance has been done by christos in ref .",
    "@xcite , but without introducing the nucleon mirror fields .",
    "indeed , he studied only the two independent nucleon non - derivative fields and related their masses to certain @xmath2 symmetry conserving interactions .",
    "one distinct disadvantage of models without mirror nucleons is that phenomenologically they can not describe the one - pion decays of nucleon resonances at the tree level  @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to consider a class of models that includes mirror nucleons , which task we complete in the present paper .",
    "there is another kind of baryon chiral multiplet mixing : the @xmath23 and @xmath24 mixing . that is possible only when one allows derivatives in the three - quark interpolating fields , and",
    "will be dealt with in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "this paper falls into five sections . after the introduction , in sect .",
    "ii we give a reminder of the basic facts regarding the nucleon fields and their chiral transformation properties , as well as derive the chiral properties of the new derivative fields .",
    "then in sect .",
    "iii we examine the nucleon - meson couplings and classify the interaction terms according to their symmetry properties for one particular pair of nucleon fields . in sect .",
    "iv we calculate some of the basic predictions of this effective interaction . finally , in sect . v we summarize and draw our conclusions .",
    "firstly we examine the @xmath5 and @xmath2 transformation properties of various quark trilinear forms with quantum numbers of the nucleon .",
    "this leads us to two pairs of independent even and odd - parity nucleon resonances with particularly simple @xmath5 and @xmath2 transformation properties .",
    "five non - vanishing , apparently different baryon local fields have been explicitly constructed from three quark fields without derivatives , such that the nucleon quantum numbers are properly reproduced . only two out of these five local trilinear fields , are linearly independent , however @xcite .",
    "their propriety for the job at hand can be tested in various ways : one way is by study of their chiral symmetry transformation properties , another is by directly applying them to the study of physical quantities , e.g. by qcd sum rule or lattice qcd . in the qcd sum rule approach , it was shown that one linear combination of the two independent nucleon fields couples predominantly to the ground state nucleon , while the one with orthogonal weights couples to the lowest - lying odd - parity nucleon resonance @xmath25(1535 )   @xcite .      for completeness sake",
    "we show the five non - derivative objects involving three quark fields @xmath26 which are assigned as even - parity ( as indicated by the superscript @xmath27 ) , spin 1/2 , isospin 1/2 (  nucleon \" ) fields . here",
    "indices @xmath28 and @xmath29 label the color of the three quarks , whereas the pauli matrices @xmath30 operate in the isospin space , and @xmath31 is the light quark iso - doublet ; we also define the @xmath32 to stand for @xmath33 in shorthand notation : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the second pauli matrix in isospin space .",
    "ioffe  @xcite used fierz transformations to show that there are two independent nucleon fields .",
    "thus , one may use various combinations of independent fields among eqs .",
    "( [ n_1 ] ) - ( [ n_5 ] ) for the computation of two point correlation functions , but the linearly independent choices are all equivalent , for instance , to eqs .",
    "( [ n_1 ] ) - ( [ n_2 ] ) .",
    "we shall try and systematize the nucleon fields according to both their abelian and non - abelian chiral transformation properties and show that this classification lends new meaning to certain concepts introduced into the linear gell - mann ",
    "levy sigma model some time ago . as mentioned in the introduction , lee , detar and kunihiro , and jido et al .",
    "@xcite used such a model to calculate the even - odd parity nucleon mass difference as well as the decay properties of the odd - parity resonances as a function of their chiral transformation properties (  naive \" or  mirror \" ) .    in the qcd sum rule studies",
    ", it is well known that a typical combination of a scalar - isoscalar nucleon field eq.([n_1 ] ) and of the pseudoscalar - isoscalar one eq .",
    "( [ n_2 ] ) successfully describes the properties of the nucleon .",
    "in addition , this choice leads to one of the best known non - abelian chiral transformation properties , _ viz . _",
    "the  naive \" non - abelian one , while we find a somewhat complicated abelian chiral transformation law ( that can be reduced to a direct sum of a  triple naive \" and a  mirror \" abelian chiral transformations ) .",
    "this is the starting assumption of this paper , and its consequences will be discussed extensively .",
    "let us consider the scalar - isoscalar @xmath37 and the pseudoscalar - isoscalar @xmath38 even - parity nucleon fields @xmath39 they transform according to the linear realization under the non - abelian chiral transformations : @xmath40 whereas under the abelian chiral transformations the rule is also linear , but slightly more complicated as it mixes in the second nucleon field : @xmath41 in other words they seem to form a two - dimensional representation of the abelian chiral symmetry @xmath42 , or an @xmath2 doublet .",
    "of course , all irreducible representations of an abelian lie group are one - dimensional . therefore the  chiral doublet \" two - dimensional representation of @xmath2 furnished by the fields @xmath43 and defined by eqs .",
    "( [ e : nuc+atrf1 ] ) and ( [ e : nuc+atrf ] ) must be a reducible one .",
    "the symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of two ( identical parity ) nucleon fields @xmath43 transform according to the irreducible representation : @xmath44 then their abelian chiral transformation properties are @xmath45 note the factor 3 in front of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ e : nuc+atrf1 ] ) , i.e. , it is the  triply - naive \" abelian axial baryon charge transformation law , as it should be for an object consisting of three quarks , and the negative sign in front of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ e : nuc+atrf2 ] ) , as it should for an abelian  mirror \" nucleon .",
    "the non - abelian transformations remain unchanged (  naive \" ) @xmath46    the triply - naive abelian field does not have an @xmath2 symmetric interaction that is linear in meson fields . the factor 3 on the right - hand side of the abelian chiral transformation law",
    "( [ e : nuc+atrf1 ] ) suggests , however , that the appropriate power of meson fields should also be three , and , indeed , there are two independent @xmath22 invariants that are cubic in meson fields , see [ app : cubic ] .",
    "in other words , the @xmath22 symmetry breaking is not intrinsic in the  triple - naive \" abelian nucleon structure .",
    "now , from the pair - wise nature of the nucleon fields under the @xmath22 transformations , it is natural to consider the nucleon resonance states consisting of two parity doublets , i.e. , of two even - parity and two odd - parity nucleons .",
    "if all the resonances belong to the naive non - abelian representation , we can not avoid the decoupling of off - diagonal @xmath47 interaction , as shown in ref .",
    "hence we need to find two fields with  mirror \" non - abelian chiral properties .",
    "we have shown that it is not possible to construct a  mirror \" non - abelian nucleon from three quarks without derivatives @xcite .",
    "without such a  mirror \" field , it is impossible to have a pure  naive - mirror mass term \" that prevents the decoupling of the pion interaction term .",
    "therefore , let us try and see if that can be done when one derivative is available .",
    "we can construct nucleon fields with ",
    "contravariant \" chiral transformations to those shown above by the replacement of @xmath48 with a derivative @xmath49 ( or a covariant @xmath50 in qcd ) , for example the following two derivative objects involving three quark fields @xmath51 they are odd - parity , spin 1/2 and isospin 1/2 fields , i.e. they describe ( some ) nucleon resonances .",
    "a prime in the superscript implies that the fields contain a derivative , and we show below that therefore they have opposite , i.e. , mirror , non - abelian chiral transformation properties to those of the corresponding non - derivative fields .",

    "of course , we have not included the mixing with the @xmath13 chiral multiplet , as yet , which was assumed by weinberg @xcite to be vital for the isovector axial coupling , and may yet solve the isoscalar axial coupling problem , as well @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the role of chiral symmetry in general and of the @xmath2 symmetry in particular in the nucleon - roper - two - odd - parity - nucleon - resonances system , under the assumption that the above four nucleon states form a particular set of chiral multiplets , as implied by the three - quark construction of the baryon interpolating fields .",
    "the four nucleon fields naturally split into two  parity doublets \" due to their @xmath2 symmetry transformation properties . we classify the meson - nucleon interactions according to their @xmath2 symmetry transformation properties .",

    "cubic \" ones , which are sometimes redundant for the purpose of mass determination . yet ,",
    "note , that _ if we had only ( incorrectly ) insisted on interactions that are linear in meson fields , we would have been led to the different conclusion that the masses of the ",

    "only two @xmath61 decays are kinematically allowed , so they are not sufficient to determine ( all of ) the remaining ( @xmath62 ) couplings .",
    "the insight that the nucleon and the roper fields may form two different representations of the @xmath22 symmetry , and that their mass differences can be explained only by the spontaneous breaking of @xmath63 and @xmath22 symmetries , while explicitly preserving the @xmath22 symmetry , is the main result of the present paper .",
    "a corollary of this result is that the parity - doublet mass splittings are not determined by the @xmath2 symmetry breaking , as was conjectured in the literature @xcite .",
