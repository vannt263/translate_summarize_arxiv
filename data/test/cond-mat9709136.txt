    "when a system in a disordered phase is rapidly quenched to a temperature below its ordering temperature it orders kinetically [ ] . in the early stage the fluctuations in the initial state are amplified and domains of macroscopic size are formed . at late time",
    "the ordering system is usually characterized by a single time - dependent length , the average domain size @xmath0 , which grows as a power law @xmath1 ( scaling regime ) [ ] .",
    "the growth exponent depends on the mechanism driving the phase separation . for a system with a scalar not - conserved order parameter ( model a )",
    "the growth is curvature driven and @xmath2 [ ] .",
    "the mechanism in systems with conserved order parameter ( model b ) is the diffusion of the order parameter from interfaces of high curvature to regions of low curvature and @xmath3 [ ] .",
    "this work concerns the ordering in the ising version of the bidimensional isotropic eight vertex model after a quench to the striped phase .",

    "the quenching of model ( [ eq : ham ] ) to the ferromagnetic phase with @xmath6 has been studied in both two and three dimensions [ ] .",
    "when @xmath7 there are energy barriers for the coarsening of domains , hence the system does not relax to equilibrium if the temperature is zero . these energy barriers do not increase with the linear dimension of domains in @xmath8 , while in @xmath9 the energy barrier is proportional to the linear dimension of domains thus leading to a very slow dynamics [ ] .    the phase diagram of model ( [ eq : ham ] )",

    "the order parameter for saf phases is the difference between the magnetization on odd and even rows ( columns ) .",

    "as to the single - spin - flip dynamics we show that the analysis of the pair correlation functions introduced in [ ] gives results indistinguishable from those obtained considering the longitudinal and transversal correlation functions as described in [ ] .",

    "the growth exponents of domains after a quenching in the saf phase have been already measured in [ ] ; it is interesting to measure those exponents studying the scaling properties of physical quantities different from those considered in [ ] .    in order to describe the main features of domains we remark that the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) is four - fold degenerate , so the typical configuration of the system in the scaling regime consists of a patchwork of domains of four types ( see fig . 1a ) . in the following we refer to domains having magnetized rows as  horizontal \" domains , we call  vertical \" domains those with magnetized columns .",
    "first of all we studied the amount of interfaces ( see fig .",
    "1b ) present in the system to monitor the domain growth towards the equilibrium , that is to estimate the dimension of the domains . indeed in two dimensions the total length of interfaces per unit volume scales as the inverse of the average size of domains ( see [ ] where the scaling of interfaces is used to measure the growth exponent in the case of ferromagnetic ising model ) .",
    "the definition of interfaces between different domains is not straightforward in the case of the superantiferromagnetic phase . in order to detect",
    "if a given site belongs to a domain or to the interface , we compare the configuration of the system in a neighborhood of the site with two given patterns in the following way : let us consider a site of the lattice , we denote it by the pair @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the row and column index , and we denote by @xmath18 the corresponding spin .",
    "we consider a positive integer number @xmath19 , denote by @xmath20 the @xmath21 square block centered at site @xmath15 and compute the two following quantities @xmath22 where @xmath23 is kroneker s delta .",
    "we remark that @xmath24 and @xmath25 provides , respectively , the  distance \" in @xmath20 between the present configuration and a saf horizontal or vertical domain .",
    "if @xmath24 or @xmath25 are less than a fixed integer number @xmath26 , we say that the site @xmath15 belongs , respectively , to an horizontal or vertical saf domain ; otherwise we say that the site @xmath15 is an interface site .",
    "all the results that will be described in this paper have been obtained with @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; we have checked that our results do not depend on the choice of the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath26 .    in fig .",
    "2 it is depicted the logarithm of the total number @xmath29 of interface sites for a @xmath30 lattice system as a function of the logarithm of the time in the case of finite temperature ( @xmath31 ) and parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "black circles and black squares ( above and below in the picture ) are monte carlo results obtained averaging over @xmath35 different histories respectively in the case of single - spin - flip [ ] and spin - exchange dynamics [ ] .",
    "we find the scaling law @xmath36 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively in the case of single - spin - flip and spin - exchange dynamics , thus confirming the growth exponent found in [ ] .",
    "the scaling law and the values of the exponent @xmath37 have been shown not to depend on the j s and on the value of @xmath38 . in the case of single - spin - flip dynamics",
    "the case of zero temperature [ ] ( @xmath39 ) has been considered , as well .",
    "we also checked that these results are not affected by finite size effects .",
    "another way of measuring the exponent @xmath37 , in the case of not - conserved dynamics , consists in studying the shrinking of a @xmath40 square domain ( ball ) of one phase plunged into the sea of one of the three other phases . in fig .",
    "3 it is shown the shrinking of a @xmath41 square vertical domain plunged into the sea of the horizontal superantiferromagnetic phase .",
    "the contraction of the ball is achieved via the corner erosion , indeed in this way no energy barrier must be bypassed . in [ ] it has been remarked that the shrinking time @xmath42 of such a domain scales as @xmath43 .",
    "we found that the time of shrinking scales as @xmath44 , see fig .",
    "4 , for large @xmath19 and for any choice of the phase of the background , this confirms the growth exponent @xmath2 .",
    "let us now turn to consider the correlation properties of growing domains in the scaling regime . in [ ]",
    "we introduced two different types of correlation functions , the _ longitudinal _ and the _ transverse _ one ; these two functions are denoted respectively by @xmath45 and @xmath46 and they are defined as follows @xmath47 where @xmath48 is one ( zero ) if site @xmath15 belongs to a horizontal ( vertical ) domain and the average is performed over sites belonging to domains at time t ( interface sites are excluded ) and over different stories of the system .",
    "we remark that the longitudinal correlation function measures the correlation properties of domains in the direction where spins are aligned , while the transverse correlation function measures the correlation properties in the direction where the spins are alternate .",
    "we found that the correlation functions introduced above have a scaling behavior in the scaling regime ; in the case of single - spin - flip dynamics they depend only on the combination @xmath49 : @xmath50 simulations discussed in [ ] have shown that the scaling functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are different , due to the presence of interfaces between the four types of domains having different interface energies . the ojk theory [ ] well describes the pair scaling functions in anisotropic cases if a free parameter is used to fit the data in the different directions ( see [ ] ) .",
    "we also note that in this case two typical lengths characterize the ordering system , the average longitudinal domain size @xmath53 and the transverse one @xmath54 ; we evaluated them as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the fourier transforms of @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "we verified that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are different but they both have the correct scaling @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "now we check that the anisotropic behavior of domains growth does not depend on the peculiar way in which ( [ eq : cl ] ) measure the correlations , indeed we show that the analysis of the pair correlation functions introduced in [ ] yields similar results .    as in [ ]",
    "let us divide the lattice into four sublattices corresponding to a @xmath62 unit cell ; a two - components order parameter @xmath63 can be expressed in terms of the sublattices magnetizations @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the total number of sites in the lattice , by defining @xmath70 the four ground states of model ( [ eq : ham ] ) correspond to the four following values of the order parameter @xmath71 : @xmath72 we observe that @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) corresponds to a striped phase in the direction parallel to the @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) axis .    by decomposing @xmath71 into its contributions from individual unit cells @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the cell index",
    ", one can consider the correlation between the components of the two - valued order parameter .",
    "two of such correlations can be put in correspondence with the longitudinal and transverse correlation functions ( [ eq : cl ] ) .",
    "indeed , let us consider two cells @xmath78 and @xmath79 connected by a vector parallel to the @xmath75 axis : it is easy to see that the average of the product @xmath80 measures the longitudinal correlations , while the averaged @xmath81 is a measure of the transverse correlations in the growing system .",
    "conversely , given two cells connected by a vector parallel to the @xmath76 axis , @xmath80 and @xmath81 measure respectively the transverse and the longitudinal correlations . in this framework the natural way to define transverse and longitudinal correlation functions is the following : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the unit vectors in the @xmath75 and @xmath76 directions and the average is performed over all the cells at time t and over different stories of the system .",
    "although @xmath85 s and @xmath86 s are defined in a slightly different way , we note that from the physical point of view they are expected to satisfy the following identities @xmath87 where the factor @xmath88 in the argument of the @xmath85 s is due to the fact that the dynamical variables @xmath77 live on a lattice with spacing which is twice the original one .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the scaling collapse of the correlation functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 . data in fig . 5 above ( below ) have been obtained by monte carlo simulations performed on a @xmath91 lattice system with a single - spin - flip dynamics , at zero temperature and parameters @xmath32 ( @xmath92 ) , @xmath33 and @xmath6 . the correlation functions ( [ eq : cl - bin ] ) , taken at different times , have been plotted in terms of the scaling variable @xmath93 . from the picture",
    "it is clear that the anisotropy is confirmed and that a simmetric behavior with respect to the change of the sign of @xmath94 is observed .",
    "solid lines in fig .",
    "5 represent the best fit of our data obtained with the ojk function @xmath95 \\;\\;\\ ; ; \\label{eq : ojk}\\ ] ] the optimal choices of the parameter @xmath96 is @xmath97 @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) respectively for the longitudinal and transverse function in the case @xmath32 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the validity of the identities ( [ eq : ident ] ) is confirmed by the fact that the best fits of the @xmath96 s , in the case of the @xmath85 s ( see [ ] ) , are close to be four times the best fits of the @xmath96 s in the case of the @xmath86 s functions .",
    "finally we discuss the simulations we have performed with spin - exchange dynamics .",
    "we used heat bath spin - exchange between nearest neighbor pairs of spins [ ] . in fig .",
    "6 the collapse of correlation functions ( [ eq : cl ] ) is shown : monte carlo data have been plotted in terms of the scaling variable @xmath102 .",
    "simulations have been performed on a @xmath103 lattice , at inverse temperature @xmath31 and parameters @xmath104 , @xmath33 and @xmath6 .",
    "we see that the anisotropic behavior is observed in the case of the spin - exchange dynamics as well .",
    "again we found that the longitudinal and the transverse correlation functions are exchanged when @xmath105 .",
    "in this paper we have further analyzed the dynamical scaling behavior in a two - dimensional spin model with competing interactions which had been already investigated in [ ] .",
    "we measured the growth exponents studying physical magnitudes not considered in previous papers : the scaling of the interfaces and the scaling of the shrinking time of a ball of one phase plunged in the sea of another phase .",
    "our results confirm the predictions found in [ ] .",
    "the anisotropic behavior of the correlations has been further investigated by measuring the pair correlation functions introduced in [ ] and their physical equivalence with the correlation functions used in [ ] has been pointed out .",
    "our simulations show anisotropic features for the correlations in growing system and the simmetric behavior with respect to the change of the sign of the nearest neighbors coupling .",
    "finally , we have shown that the anisotropy is observed also in the case of spin exchange dynamics .",
