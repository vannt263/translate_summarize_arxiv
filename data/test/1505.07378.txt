    "neutrons emitted from the muon - stopping target of the comet experiment could cause fake veto signals in the cosmic veto counter ( cvc ) . besides , they could damage silicon photo - multipliers mppcs to be used in the cvc @xcite . on average , neutrons appear in six of ten muon captures by nuclei of a target made of aluminum , that results in @xmath0 neutrons per second for the comet phase - i .",
    "possible spectra of neutrons from muon captures are shown in fig .",
    "[ nspe ] .",
    "there are two major ways , in which neutrons affect the cvc : ( i ) through gammas from neutron captures by materials of the comet detector and ( ii ) kicking out protons and ions right in the cvc . the latter way is discussed in detail in the section [ response ] . since there is a threshold for signal amplitudes of the cvc photo - detectors ,",
    "signals of low - energy neutrons are being rejected .",
    "affordable values of the threshold lie from one tenth to one fifth of the average mip signal in cvc , so the threshold corresponds to @xmath1@xmath2 mev of energy deposited in scintillator by ionization .",
    "therefore , we do not discuss low - energy neutrons in the section [ response ] , but only those with kinetic energy from 0.1 mev to 1 mev  usually referred to as fast ones  and medium - energy neutrons carrying up to 10 mev . in the section [ shielding ] we discuss energies typical for spectrum of muon captures .",
    "in all simulations presented in this note , the ftfp_bert_hp physics list is used .",
    "in order to clarify neutron s behavior in polystyrene , an ensemble of @xmath3 neutrons at normal incidence has been simulated .",
    "the energy threshold for the geant4 proton creation has been set to 0.1 kev .",
    "the simulation has shown that fast and medium - energy neutrons traversing 7 mm thick polystyrene  ( c@xmath4h@xmath4)@xmath5  scintillator interact predominantly elastically .",
    "those elastic interactions lead largely to production of charged projectiles  protons and carbon ions  that deposit their kinetic energy mostly through ionization causing scintillation in polystyrene .",
    "track lengths of the charged projectiles lie in the sub - millimeter range .",
    "their ionization energy loss per path length @xmath6 is much higher than that of mip , so the resulting light yield per path length @xmath7 lessens due to saturation effects described by the birks empiric law @xmath8 where @xmath9 is defined by the light yield at low ionization , and @xmath10 is a material - dependent coefficient that we take equal to 0.126 mm / mev for polystyrene - based scintillators , following authors of @xcite .    in order to quantitatively understand the birks effect for neutron s energies of interest , we have computed spectra of the energy deposited to ionization by charged projectiles created in the elastic collisions of incident neutrons , see fig .",
    "[ sper ] , as well as their track lengths .",
    "table  [ estim ] summarizes mean values of both the energy loss and the track length .",
    "the right column presents quotients of the two values , which are good estimates of the most probable value of the ionization energy loss per path length referred as stopping power .    .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     dimensions of the shield depend on details of its composition and design .",
    "the optimal configuration of the shield is of arched shape , which accounts for signal attenuation along strips , and better protects mppcs that are located at outer ends of strips , see fig .",
    "[ shape ] . the final choice of shield s composition and shape",
    "shall be done taking into account the cost of materials , convenience of construction , and affordable outer size the cvc .",
    "geant4 simulations have been performed including details of signal coincidence in a scintillator strip veto counter , namely time and transverse spatial information from strips .",
    "simulation have shown that a mix of iron and concrete performs quite well as a base material for the inner shield of the cvc . in the conjunction with the solenoid yoke ,",
    "a shield composed of that mix , polyethylene and lead drastically reduces the neutron flux at the counter strips .",
    "thereby , the time loss concerned with fake veto signals of neutrons in the strips can be reduced to a tolerable value of 1% of data - taking time by a 4050 cm thick shield even at the 5-pixel threshold of photo - detectors . in the context of muon registration efficiency , values of the photo - detector threshold up",
    "to 11 pixels can be safely used @xcite .",
    "that would additionally reduce the time lost due of fake veto signals by a factor up to 1.5 , cf .",
    "table  [ thick ] .",
    "the shield can be comprised of 20 to 30  cm of the iron - concrete mix , 10  cm of polyethylene and 5  cm of lead .",
    "such a shield would reduce the flux of fast and more energetic neutrons at photo - detectors by 2 orders of magnitude . since the expected value of the flux at cvc is about @xmath11@xmath12s , no substantial decrease of the photo - detector efficiency",
    "is expected throughout full period of data taking .",
