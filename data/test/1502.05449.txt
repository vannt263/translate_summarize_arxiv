    "* ) , and are spaced closely . in multiple systems that contain high number of planets ( 4 - 6 )",
    ", the spacing is so tight that there may be of order @xmath1 planets fitted inside the orbit of mercury .",
    "systems where a single planet transit ( kepler single ) and where multiple planets transit ( kepler multis ) may share the same intrinsic architecture but only differ in transit geometry .",
    "however , a few statistical studies have shown that this is not the case .",
    "there appears to be an excess in the number of singles over what one expects by extrapolating from the kepler multis @xcite , suggesting that many of the singles are intrinsically singles .",
    "even the multis may contain different sorts of systems .",
    "a direct probe of the underlying population is provided by transit - time - variations ( ttv ) .",
    "@xcite probed the presence of close - companions ( transiting or not ) around kepler candidates using ttv signals .",
    "they found a striking correlation between the fraction of planets that show detectable ttvs and their transit multiplicity .",
    "systems where four or more planets transit enjoy four times higher ttv fraction than kepler singles do , and about twice as high as those with two or three transiting planets",
    ". this led them to propose that there are at least two different classes of kepler systems , one closely packed and one sparsely populated ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "besides from planet spacing , orbital eccentricity and inclinations also differ between the two classes . compared to kepler multis",
    ", the transit durations of kepler singles appear to be longer , requiring their orbits to have higher eccentricities ( wu , unpublished ) ; study of stellar obliquity suggests that kepler singles may lie on orbits more misaligned with the stellar spin than the multis @xcite .",
    "both lend to the picture that kepler multis are dynamically cold systems , while singles are dynamically hotter .",
    "what could have produced such a dichotomy ?",
    "@xcite explored the possibility of dynamical instability .",
    "they boosted the masses of observed triple planetary systems by about a factor of 10 and found that these systems could become destabilized within 10 billion years .",
    "this led them to hypothesize that kepler singles may be the aftermath of dynamical instability . in this study , we provide much more definite arguments to this hypothesis by investigating the spacing distribution among the closely packed multi systems ( 4 planets and more ) .",
    "we find that , adopting realistic planetary masses and ages , kepler high multiple systems are packed close to the boundary of stability .",
    "this proximity has to be explained .",
    "unless the formation mechanism is somehow capable of producing this proximity , the most likely explanation is that the primordial systems had a range of spacing , but the ones that were packed too closely have been sculpted away by the subsequent billions of years of evolution . in this hypothesis , kepler singles and lower multiples are the descendants of kepler multis .",
    "if this true , we may be able to recover the primordial spacing of planetary systems .",
    "here , we set the scene by reviewing some previous results on stability in multiple planetary systems .",
    "johannes kepler ( 1571 - 1630 ) , after whom the _ kepler _ mission is named , initially believed that the spacing of planets in the solar system is limited by packing perfect solids ( polygons with identical faces ) .",
    "he discarded this idea after developing his famous kepler laws .",
    "however , the question still remains , how tight can you pack planets together without affecting dynamical instability . over the past few decades , some theoretical progress have been made in answering this question , and in some special cases the answers are known exactly",
    ".    one usually measure spacing between every two planets in a unit called the mutual hill sphere @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the semi - major axis and mass of the two planets , and @xmath7 the mass of the central star . in this unit , planet spacing can be expressed as a dimensionless number @xmath8 @xmath9    we first focus only on orbits that are circular and coplanar .",
    "a well known result , derived by @xcite based on overlapping of first order mean - motion resonances , is that a test particle ( @xmath10 ) perturbed by a planet ( @xmath11 ) is subject to orbital chaos if it lies too close to the planet , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the planet mass ratio and the numerical coefficient is adopted from @xcite . in @xmath8 value , the critical spacing is @xmath14 this result is little modified if the test particle is instead substituted by a planet @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath16 ( albeit weak ) indicates that hill sphere is not necessarily the best unit to measure stability .",
    "however , we adopt it here for convenience .",
    "there is also an important result on hill stability ( stability against orbit crossing ) , popularized in astronomy by @xcite . as a result of total energy and angular momentum conservation , two initially circular",
    ", coplanar planets can avoid close encounters at all times if they are separated by more than @xmath17 .",
    "these two criteria meet at @xmath18 and their physical connection is discussed in @xcite . for systems where there are more than 2 planets",
    ", there is yet no theoretical understanding for the origin of dynamical instability ( see attempts by , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whatever information we have on how tight one can pack planets in these cases are empirical results from numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "these we summarize below",
    ".    generally speaking , systems with more planets ( @xmath19 ) require larger @xmath8 spacing to stay stable . to compare the various numerical studies ,",
    "we scale the physical timescale by the orbital period of the inner most planet in the system , @xmath20 ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "we also suppress error - bars in the fitting results but caution that there are intrinsically large scatters .",
    "* dependence on @xmath21 : two - planet systems can remain indefinitely stable as long as they are above a critical spacing .",
    "this may not hold for large - n systems .",
    "it appears that a larger spacing does not guarantee eternal peace but only delays the time of instability ( we return to this point in  [ subsec : extrapolate ] ) .",
    "numerically , the critical spacing at which an average system undergoes their first encounter at time @xmath21 can be modelled as @xcite , @xmath22 though the alternative scalings @xmath23 and @xmath24 $ ] have been adopted by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the numerical coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend on system parameters like the number of planets , their masses , and orbital eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "two results most relevant to our case are @xmath27 for systems of @xmath28 planets all with @xmath29 @xcite , and @xmath30 for @xmath31 planet systems with @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "both scalings are obtained for circular , coplanar systems with a uniform planetary mass and a uniform k - spacing . *",
    "dependence on @xmath19 :",
    "the most comprehensive study to date on this issue is that by @xcite .",
    "they found , for @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , the critical separation for a system of circular , coplanar planets goes as @xmath35 this results roughly recovers equation when @xmath36 .",
    "the initial rise of @xmath15 with @xmath19 is intuitively understood as the presence of more planetary perturbers exerts more strain on the delicate dynamical systems .",
    "the subsequent flattening of @xmath15 with @xmath19 is , however , surprising and not understood .",
    "one guess is that dynamical instability is most affected by close neighbours , and the presence of far - away neighbours , once beyond a certain separation , do not matter .",
    "for instance , a system of 8 neptunes will space a period range of @xmath37 .",
    "with such a large spacing , newly added planets have no chance of participating in any mmrs with the pre - existing planets , and therefore should not adversely affect the stability of the system .",
    "* dependence on @xmath16 : it is found that less massive planets , with their smaller hill spheres , need be separated by slightly higher values of @xmath8 .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite found that , for every decade of drop in @xmath16 ( within the range of @xmath38 to @xmath39 ) , the critical separation @xmath8 should increase by @xmath40 .",
    "* eccentricity / inclination : if the planetary orbits are dynamically hot , more elbow room is needed to maintain stability ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite showed that , at low eccentricities , increasing the average eccentricity by @xmath41 raises @xmath42 by @xmath43 .",
    "we know of no study that explores the impact of mutual inclination separately , so we provide some illustrations of this below .    returning to our problem at hand ",
    "a system of 8 flat , circular planets , with masses of @xmath44 , and an inner orbit of @xmath45 au , may remain stable for over 1 gyrs ( or @xmath46 ) , if @xmath47 ( extrapolating from equation [ eq : tauk ] ) .",
    "this valueis broadly consistent with the spacing observed in tight kepler systems .",
    "however , a more refined approach is required .      to compare theoretical results to kepler systems , we need to overcome a few restrictions of previous studies .",
    "first , in almost all previous numerical simulations , planets in a given systems are assigned identical masses and identical spacing , in contrast to realistic systems .",
    "inhomogeneities in mass and spacing may impact results significantly , e.g. , they will introduce large scatter in stability lifetimes , among systems that have comparable bulk parameters .",
    "it is therefore necessary to study system stability in a statistical sense  previous investigations have studied only a small number of cases ( typically fewer than a hundred systems ) .",
    "we accomplish this by integrating a much larger number of systems ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "in addition , we wish to study the impacts of small eccentricity and inclination .",
    "lastly , our simulations run for a factor of @xmath49 longer than previous works , up to @xmath50 years .",
    "although still shorter than the typical system ages ( a giga - year ) , they provide a better indicator for long - term stability .",
    "we generate artificial planetary systems as follows : each system contains @xmath51 planets orbiting around a 1 solar mass star , on coplanar and circular orbits .",
    "the number @xmath51 is chosen for a number of reasons : this is the largest number of transiting planets in a multiple system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; it is close enough to the plateau in equation , the results may be considered valid for all systems with more than @xmath51 planets ; it is computationally feasible .",
    "the mass of the host star is taken to be @xmath52 , while the mass of the planets are drawn from a uniform distribution between @xmath53 , consistent with the range of masses observed in kepler systems @xcite .",
    "the latter assumption is robust as we know the stability threshold only depends weakly on the planet masses (  [ subsec : previous ] ) .",
    "the inner most planet is placed at @xmath45 au .",
    "we then determine the spacing , in unit of mutual hill sphere , for an adjacent pair of planets by drawing from a normal distribution with mean @xmath54 and variance @xmath55 , @xmath56 the initial arguments of periapsis and the mean motions are drawn from a uniform distribution in @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "we adopt the wisdom - holman integration scheme @xcite , as implemented in the swifter package by david e. kaufmann , an improved version of the original swift package by levison and duncan .",
    "the post - newtonian correction is added as an additional potential of the form @xmath58 , and we adopt a time - step of @xmath59 years .",
    "integrations are discontinued either when two planets approached one another within one mutual hill radius ( and therefore are destined for a close encounter ) , or when a preset time limit ( usually @xmath60 years ) is reached .",
    "we record the stability time of each system , and analyze how it depends on various parameters .",
    "of particular interest is the survival probability at a given time .",
    "we integrate , up to a time of @xmath60 years , a total of 8,000 circular , coplanar systems ( @xmath61 ) with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , we simulate 120 such systems , within the range @xmath62 and @xmath64 , up to a time of @xmath50 years .",
    "we report the survival probability , the fraction of systems that remain stable up to a time @xmath65 , as a function of planet spacing .",
    "overall , a wider @xmath54 leads to a higher survival probability ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] ) , however , the dispersion in @xmath8 ( @xmath55 ) also impacts stability . for the same @xmath66 ,",
    "systems with a greater @xmath8 dispersion amongst its pairs are less stable . in other words ,",
    "a pair of planets with a smaller - than - average @xmath8 have a destabilizing effect on the whole system that out - weighs any corresponding stabilizing effect afforded by a planet pair with a larger - than - average @xmath8 .",
    "we find , empirically , that our results can be succinctly summarized using an effective spacing , @xmath67    we arrive at this combination by noticing that , in our simulations , increasing @xmath68 by 1.0 has the same effect on stability as decreasing @xmath66 by @xmath69 .",
    "so for systems with a varied spacing , @xmath70 acts as an equivalence of @xmath8 in systems with a uniform spacing .",
    "such a combination can also explain the results in @xcite where they made some preliminary explorations on the impact of a @xmath8-dispersion .",
    "we can now fit the survival probability reported in fig .",

    "the dimensionless time @xmath20 , and @xmath74 is the orbital period of the inner most planet ( @xmath2 days in our case ) .",
    "we now define a threshold spacing , @xmath75 , as the smallest @xmath70 necessary to achieve a survival probability of @xmath76 at time @xmath65 .",
    "this spacing has a similar functional form to that presented in @xcite , but with different numerical coefficients , @xmath77 we compare our critical spacing with those from previous works in fig .",
    "[ fig : kcollection ] .",
    "our results , with a spread in @xmath8 and in planetary masses , have to be characterized by @xmath78 .",
    "this differs from the definition of @xmath15 for other groups , which typically adopt a uniform @xmath8 and mass .",
    "however , results broadly agree within error - bars ( as given by * ? ? ? * ) but ours tend to fall below . in other words , at the same spacing ( measured by @xmath70 in our cases ) , inhomogeneous systems ( with mass and spacing dispersions ) remain stable slightly longer than homogeneous systems do .",
    "we note that homogenous systems , with their uniform period ratios , tend to be strongly affected by the presence of mean - motion resonances ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see , e.g. ) .",
    "this may partially explain the difference .",
    "a more important difference between homogenous and inhomogeneous systems is that the former may reach eternal stability at a finite spacing ( as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while we do not observe this for the latter ( see  [ subsec : extrapolate ] ) .",
    "from now on , we consider that our results ( equation [ eq : k50 ] ) supercedes equations - .    our scaling is valid for 4 orders of magnitude in @xmath21 ( @xmath79 to @xmath80 , fig .",

    "given the extra dimension in orbital parameters , it is only feasible to integrate these systems up to a time of one million years ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the survival probability for different types of orbits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5 ] .    individually",
    ", mutual inclination and initial eccentricity each has a strong destabilizing effect on stability . for the range of parameters that we explore ,",
    "the critical spacing can be characterized as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the corresponding value for circular , coplanar systems for the same @xmath21 ( eq . [ eq : k50 ] ) .",
    "an eccentricity dispersion of a mere one percent requires the spacing to expand by one hill sphere , for @xmath104 . in relative terms , mutual inclination is less destructive to stability , by about a factor of @xmath105 .",
    "one can also scale the above result in a natural unit of the problem , the hill eccentricity , @xmath106 . for our parameters , ( @xmath107 ) , @xmath108 .",
    "the expression for critical spacing , re - cast in these units , is , @xmath109 this leads to a surprisingly geometrical interpretation for our result . for every unit of eccentricity rise ( in unit of @xmath110 ) , the average spacing between two adjacent planets ( @xmath8 ) have to rise by @xmath111 in order to maintain stability ; however , such a rise in eccentricity also reduces the closest approach ( measured from the apo - apsis of the inner planet to the periapsis of the outer one ) by @xmath112 .",
    "so a system of mildly eccentric planets behaves similarly as a circular system that have the same closest approach .",
    "we do not have a ready explanation for this result .    in the following ,",

    "so it may be prudent to ask : can the scaling be extrapolated to as long as one billion years ?",
    "for instance , in two - planet systems , it is known that beyond certain spacing the system can remain eternally stable .",

    ", we turn to numerical simulations for insight . @xcite",
    "experimented with equal - mass , constant - spacing 3-planet ( or 5-planet ) systems and found that as planet spacing reaches @xmath114 ( @xmath115 for 5-planet ) , the stability time , clocked at @xmath60 dynamical time at this point , starts to lift off and increases with @xmath8 much more steeply than eq . .",
    "it appears that this equation is violated beyond @xmath60 dynamical times , and indefinite stability at large spacing appears possible .",

    "there is no unusual transition that occurs at @xmath60 dynamical times .",
    "we suspect that our heterogeneous set - up ( a dispersion of mass and spacing ) opens up a more complex phase - space .",

    "previous studies @xcite have identified that mean motion resonances tend to be disruptive for dynamical stability .",

    "the nascent disk can weed out ( and possibly reform ) systems that are unstable within a few million years ( @xmath158 , eq .",

    "this chain of thought then leads us to propose the following scenario .",
    "planetary systems were initially formed with a range of @xmath159 .",
    "this distribution is continuously sculpted by dynamical instability .",

    "we assume that the all systems have the same small @xmath8-dispersion as we observe in today s high multis , @xmath160 . since orbital spacing in a system",

    "we further assume that all systems at birth have the same dispersion in eccentricity as the currently observed ttv sample , @xmath161 , and a comparable dispersion in inclination .",
    "to reverse the effect of carving , we augment the current planet population by three populations that are similar in number but shifted to a smaller @xmath70 by @xmath162 , for the three logarithmic time intervals between @xmath163 and @xmath164 yrs . the value @xmath165 , according to our numerical experiments , is the range of spacing that is carved away by the passing of each logarithmic interval .",

    "once two planets are excited to crossing orbits , they will physically collide with each other after a short time , as determined by the area of the planet subtended on the sky , @xmath167 this expression assumes that the planets have acquired significant eccentricities and inclinations before impact , and that there is little gravitational focussing .",
    "both assumptions are born out by our numerical simulations . in particular , the latter assumption is reasonble because at collision , their relative velocities can be higher than their surface escape velocities ( @xmath168 , see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , since the keplerian orbital speed is of order @xmath169 at the relevant distance .",
    "such a collision will likely be destructive , as opposed to conglomerative @xcite .",
    "some planets may be lost and massive debris may be produced .",
    "the former will increase the spacing within the system , while the latter will tend to cool down the orbit and prevent further instabilities from happening . at the moment , we are incapable of predicting the outcome of such a collision , but speculate that this may explain the abundant low - multiple systems one observes in the field .",
    "we speculate briefly on the physical environment that can give rise to the compact spacing of systems .",

    "so if our sculpting hypothesis is correct , we infer that the formation environment of the planets have to be moderately dissipative , with an eccentricity damping timescale that is longer than the type - i damping timescale , but much shorter than the million - year lifetime of the nascent disks .",
    "we can look at our results in a different way .",
    "the observed spacing could be used to constrain the values of eccentricity and mutual inclination in ( and only in ) these high multiple systems .",
