    "extended theories of gravity @xcite are alternative theories of gravitational interaction developed from the exact starting points investigated first by einstein and hilbert and aimed from one side to extend the positive results of general relativity and , on the other hand , to cure its shortcomings . besides other fundamental issues , like dark energy and quantum gravity , these theories have been proposed like alternative approaches to newtonian gravity in order to explain galactic and extragalactic dynamics without introducing dark matter @xcite . in particular , the search for non - newtonian gravity is part of the quest for non - einsteinian physics which consists of searching for deviations from special and general relativity @xcite . they are aimed to address conceptual and experimental problems recently emerged in astrophysics and cosmology from the observations of the solar system , binary pulsars , spiral galaxies , clusters of galaxies and the large - scale structure of the universe @xcite . in general ,",
    "these theories describe gravity as a metric theory with a linear connection but there are also affine , or metric - affine formulations of extended theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "essentially , they are based on straightforward generalizations of the einstein theory where the gravitational action ( the hilbert - einstein action ) is assumed to be linear in the ricci curvature scalar @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath0 gravity is a type of modified gravity which generalizes einstein s general relativity and it was first proposed in 1970 by buchdahl @xcite .",
    "it is actually a family of models , each one defined by a different function of the ricci scalar .",
    "the simplest case is just the general relativity . in the case of @xmath0 gravity",
    ", one assumes a generic function @xmath12 of the ricci scalar @xmath2 ( in particular , analytic functions ) and searches for a theory of gravity having suitable behavior at small and large scale lengths . as a consequence of introducing an arbitrary function , there may be freedom to explain the accelerated expansion and structure formation of the universe without adding unknown forms of dark energy or dark matter .",
    "one type of the extended theories of gravity is characterized by power - law lagrangians @xcite .",
    "alternative approaches to newtonian gravity in the framework of the weak field limit of fourth order gravity theory have been proposed and constraints on these theories have been discussed @xcite .",
    "yukawa - like corrections have been obtained in the framework of @xmath0 gravity as a general feature of these theories @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that they emerge as exact solutions in the context of extended gravity and are not just put by hand as phenomenological terms .",
    "the physical meaning of such corrections needs to be confirmed at different scales : for short distances , solar system , spiral galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "a compilation of experimental , geophysical and astronomical constraints on yukawa violations of the gravitational inverse square law are given in figs .",
    "9 and 10 from @xcite for different ranges .",
    "these results show that the yukawa term is relatively well constrained for the short ranges . for longer distances yukawa corrections",
    "have been successfully applied to clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "lucchesi and peron @xcite analyzed pericenter general relativistic precession and gave constraints on exponential potential to solar system measurements .",
    "however , further tests are needed in order to set robust constraints on yukawa corrections .",
    "galactic stellar dynamics could be of great aid in this program .",
    "s - stars are mainly young early - type stars that closely orbit the massive compact object at the center of milky way , named sgr a@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "these stars , together with recently discovered dense gas cloud falling towards the galactic centre @xcite , indicate that the massive central object is a black hole . in our simulation we will treat central object like `` massive compact object '' since our goal was only to study orbits of stars around galactic centre , no matter what is the nature of the object ( black hole or not ) . for at least one of them ,",
    "called s2 , there are some observational indications that its orbit maybe deviates from the keplerian case due to relativistic precession @xcite",
    ".    however , we have to point out that the present astrometric limit is still not sufficient to definitely confirm such a claim .",
    "on the other hand , the astrometric accuracy is constantly improving from around 10 mas during the first part of the observational period , currently reaching less than 1 mas ( 0.3 mas ) see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some recent studies provide more and more evidence that the orbit of s2 star is not closing ( see e.g. fig . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "here , we fitted the ntt / vlt astrometric observations of s2 star , which contain a possible indication for orbital precession around the massive compact object at galactic centre , in order to constrain the parameters of sanders - like gravity potential , since this kind of potential has not been tested at these scales yet .",
    "we obtained much larger orbital precession of s2 star in sanders - like gravity than the corresponding value predicted by general relativity . in the paper @xcite page 1092 , fig .",
    "13 , authors presented the keplerian orbit but they have to move the position of central point mass to explain orbital precession . in our orbit , calculated by sanders - like potential for best fitting parameters , we also obtained precession , but with a fixed position of the central point mass .",
    "in other words , we do not need to move central point mass in order to get the fit .    as a general remark",
    ", the orbit of s2 will give astronomers the opportunity to test for various effects predicted by general relativity .",
    "the orbital precession can occur due to relativistic effects , resulting in a prograde pericentre shift or due to a possible extended mass distribution , producing a retrograde shift @xcite .",
    "both prograde relativistic and retrograde newtonian pericentre shifts will result in _ rosette _ shaped orbits @xcite .",
    "we have to stress that the current astrometric limit is not sufficient to unambiguously confirm such a claim .",

    "@xcite discussed physical experiments achievable via the monitoring of stellar dynamics near the galactic centre with a diffraction - limited , next - generation , extremely large telescope ( elt ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give the astronomical constraints on extended theories of gravity by using the peculiar dynamics of s2 star .",
    "in particular , we want to fix the ranges of yukawa - like correction parameters adopting the ntt / vlt observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii is devoted to a short summary of extended gravity in view of the newtonian limit where yukawa - like corrections emerge .",
    "the simulated orbits of s2 star in modified potential are considered in sec .",
    "in particular , we set the problem of how to constrain the yukawa - potential parameters .",
    "iv is devoted to the results of the simulation .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "examples of extended theories of gravity are higher - order , scalar - tensor gravities , see , for example @xcite .",
    "these theories can be characterized by two main features : @xmath14 the geometry can non - minimally couple to some scalar field ; @xmath15 higher - order curvature invariants can appear into the action . in the first case , we are dealing with scalar - tensor gravity , and in the second case we have higher - order gravity . combinations of non - minimally coupled and higher order terms can also emerge in effective lagrangian , producing mixed higher order / scalar - tensor gravity . a general class of higher - order - scalar - tensor theories in four dimensions",
    "is given by the effective action @xcite :    @xmath16,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is an unspecified function of curvature invariants and scalar field @xmath3 and @xmath17 .",
    "here we use the convention @xmath18 .",
    "the simplest extension of general relativity is achieved assuming :    @xmath19    where the action ( [ v3.1 ] ) becomes @xcite :    @xmath20\\,.\\ ] ]    a general gravitational potential , with a yukawa correction , can be obtained in the newtonian limit of any analytic @xmath0-gravity model . from a phenomenological point of view , this correction allows to consider as viable this kind of models even at small distances , provided that the yukawa correction turns out to be not relevant in this approximation as in the so called `` chameleon mechanism '' @xcite .    for the sake of simplicity , one can assume , however , analytic taylor expandable @xmath0 functions with respect to the value @xmath21 that is the minkowskian background @xcite :    @xmath22    it is worth noticing that , at the order @xmath23 , the field equations give the condition @xmath24 and then the solutions at further orders do not depend on this parameter .",
    "on the other hand , considering the first term in @xmath2 , @xmath6 has the meaning of a cosmological constant .",
    "a further step is to analyze the newtonian limit starting from the action ( [ v3.1 ] ) and considering a generic function of ricci scalar and scalar field .",
    "then the action becomes @xcite    @xmath25\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the scalar field @xmath3 can be approximated as the ricci scalar .",
    "in particular we get @xmath26 and the function @xmath1 with its partial derivatives ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and @xmath27 can be substituted by their corresponding taylor series . in the case of @xmath1 , we have @xcite :    @xmath28    and analogous relations for the derivatives are obtained . from the lowest order of field equations we have @xcite",
    "@xmath29    and also in this modified fourth order gravity a missing cosmological component in the action ( 1 ) implies that the space - time is asymptotically minkowskian ( the same outcome as above ) .",
    "moreover the ground value of scalar field @xmath3 must be a stationary point of the potential .",
    "an important remark is due at this point .",
    "as discussed in details in @xcite , a theory like @xmath1 is dynamically equivalent to @xmath30 and then also the meaning of the scalar field results clearer being related to the further gravitational degrees of freedom that come out in extended gravity @xcite .",

    "in order to constrain the parameters of @xmath0 and @xmath1 models , we simulate orbits of s2 star in yukawa - like gravity potentials and fit them to the astrometric observations obtained by new technology telescope / very large telescope ( ntt / vlt ) ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) , which are publicly available as the supplementary on - line data to the electronic version of the paper @xcite at @xcite , and which are aimed to estimate the distance from the galactic centre and to map the inner region of our galaxy .",

    ", one can relate the length - scale @xmath43 to the mass of the effective scalar field introduced by the extended theory of gravity and then to the mass and characteristic size of the self - gravitating system @xcite .",
    "the larger the mass , the smaller will be @xmath43 and the faster will be the exponential decay of the correction , i.e. the larger the mass , the quicker the recovery of the newtonian dynamics . eq.([equ01 ] ) then gives us the opportunity to investigate in a unified way the impact of a large class of modified gravity theories , included in which are the extended theories , since other details do not have any impact on the galactic scales we are interested in .    in the @xmath1-gravity the gravitational potential is found by setting the gravitational constant as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the gravitational constant as measured at infinity and by imposing @xmath46 , the gravity potential is @xcite :    @xmath47    and then a sanders - like potential is fully recovered @xcite .",
    "such a potential has been often used to obtain the rotation curves of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth stressing that the only sanders potential is unable to reproduce the rotation curves of spirals without dark matter as pointed out in an accurate study in @xcite .",
    "however , the paradigm remains valid and modifications of newtonian potential can be investigated in view of addressing the dark matter problem .",
    "we can set the value of the derivatives of the taylor expansion as @xmath48 without losing generality .",
    "the simulated orbits of s2 star in these two potentials can be obtained by numerical integration of the corresponding differential equations of motion , that is :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the reduced mass in the two - body problem .",
    "we assume the following mass and distance for sgr a@xmath13 central massive compact object around which s2 star is orbiting : @xmath51 and @xmath52 = 8.3 kpc , respectivelly @xcite . due to simplicity reasons , we perform two - body simulations and neglect perturbations from other members of the s - star cluster , as well as from some possibly existing extended structures composed by visible or dark matter @xcite .",
    "we simulate orbits of s2 star and fit them to the ntt / vlt astrometric observations for different combinations of _ a priori _ given values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in @xmath0 , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xmath1 gravity potentials ( below denoted as @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively ) .",
    "each simulated orbit is defined by the following four initial conditions : two components of initial position and two components of initial velocity in orbital plane at the epoch of the first observation . for each combination of @xmath53 and @xmath54",

    "the true positions @xmath57 and velocities @xmath58 at all successive observed epochs are then calculated by numerical integration of equations of motion ( [ 2body ] ) , and projected to the corresponding positions @xmath59 in the observed plane ( apparent orbit ) ; 3 .",

    "the new initial conditions are estimated by the fitting routine and the steps 2 - 3 are repeated until the fit is converging , i.e. until the minimum of reduced @xmath31 is achieved .",
