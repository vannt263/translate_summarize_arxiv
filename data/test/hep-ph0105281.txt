    "theories with extra spacetime dimensions have attracted great attention for last years . main phenomenological motivation , for considering such type of scenarios , was the new possibilities of resolution of gauge hierarchy problem @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was observed @xcite that due to appropriately large extra dimensions , it is possible to lower fundamental scale @xmath4 even down to few tev , while the observed weakness of gravity could be explained through large volume of extra space .",
    "in fact , for extra spacelike dimension s number @xmath9 , four dimensional planck mass @xmath10 has value @xmath11  gev if size @xmath12 of extra compact dimensions is in a range @xmath13  mm ( distance at which the behavior of gravity is still unknown and is extensively investigated in upgoing experiments @xcite ) .    an alternative approach has been suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these scenarios , although the fundamental scale can be close to @xmath10 , the required hierarchy is obtained on a ` visible ' brane through non - factorizable geometry .",
    "latter solution emerges from higher dimensional gravity with one @xcite or more @xcite extra dimensions .    in both type , of above",
    "mentioned scenarios , it is assumed that all standard model ( sm ) fields are confined to a @xmath14-brane ( identified with our universe ) in extra dimensions .",
    "the idea , that we live on a brane / topological defect embedded in a higher dimensional space , goes back to @xcite .    despite great success in solving the gauge hierarchy problem , within this type of theories ,",
    "various problems arise and numerous issues require to be reconsidered from a new viewpoint .",
    "this cast an intriguing challenge to theoreticians . amongst raised issues ,",
    "the actual task is to understand how to suppress neutrino masses in a needed level . due to low fundamental scale , the well known see - saw @xcite and scalar triplet @xcite mechanisms",
    "do not lead to the sufficient suppressions .",
    "of course , by requiring conservation of lepton number , it is possible to restrict operators responsible for neutrino masses . on the other hand , latest atmospheric @xcite and solar @xcite neutrino data",
    "have increased confidence in the neutrino oscillations .",
    "so , the purpose is to generate neutrino masses with desirable magnitudes . in @xcite",
    "there were suggested mechanisms , which have extra dimensional nature and successfully resolve this problem .",
    "one way is to couple bulk right handed neutrinos with left handed ones . in this case suppression",
    "occurs in dirac yukawa couplings through the large volume factor @xcite . needed suppression also can be achieved if lepton number violation takes place on a distant brane @xcite .",
    "different approach was presented in @xcite , where for suppression of neutrino masses , together with right handed neutrinos was introduced additional scalar doublet with a sufficiently tiny vev .    in this paper",
    "we suggest mechanism , which provides generation of suppressed neutrino masses .",
    "the mechanism do not has extra dimensional nature .",
    "suppression occurs due to group - theoretical reason .",
    "namely , by introducing extended charged @xmath15 scalar multiplets in @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 representations , neutrinos gain masses of a needed value .",
    "@xmath0 dimensional plets are efficient if fundamental scale lies in a range @xmath5  tev .",
    "@xmath1-plets are motivated for @xmath7  tev , while for @xmath8  few tev @xmath2-plets should be involved . suggested mechanism can be successfully applied also for low scale susy theories .",
    "we also address question of low scale unification which , within low scale theories , has different insight . due to presence of extra compact dimensions , @xmath16 , @xmath3 , @xmath17 gauge couplings will have power low running @xcite above the scale @xmath18 .",
    "this give possibility to obtain low scale unification @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for our scenarios , if masses of introduced scalars lie above the gut scale , then they do not alter renormalization and status of unification would be same as for cases of refs .",
    "however , if masses of @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 plets ( depending on a considered scenario ) are below the gut scale , the situation is changed .",
    "this open up new possibilities of unification for non susy and susy scenarios as well . within non susy models introduced",
    "@xmath3 scalars are crucial for successful unification .",
    "for generating adequately suppressed neutrino masses , within low scale theories , we will introduce extended @xmath3 scalars .    introduce scalar @xmath19 which under @xmath20 transform as @xmath21 , where @xmath17 charge is measured in the units of charge of lepton doublet @xmath22 .",
    "our studies , of generation suppressed neutrino masses , do not related with existence of extra dimensions .",
    "we assume that @xmath19 and all standard model particles are localized on a @xmath14-brane . in order to avoid too large majorana neutrino masses",
    ", somehow we have to forbid @xmath23 type operators ( @xmath24 is sm higgs doublet ) .",
    "this can be achieved through some symmetries .",
    "conservation also to the appropriate @xmath25 operators . ] for simplicity we will assume that lepton number ( @xmath26 ) is conserved in the fermion sector ( as were done in @xcite-@xcite ) and prescribe to @xmath19 lepton number @xmath27 .",
    "so , the yukawa sector possesses @xmath28 symmetry :    _ = ll h+h.c .  , where @xmath29 is dimensionless matrix in a family space . as we see ,",
    "in this case , neutrino masses get additional suppression @xmath30 ( in comparison with scenario with scalar triplets @xcite ) .",
    "but for low @xmath4 more suppression is needed .",
    "namely , @xmath19 should develop appropriately tiny vev along its neutral component .",
    "this is naturally insured through the scalar potential , with relevant couplings .",
    "most general @xmath31 invariant renormalizable potential is    @xmath32 ^+h^+h + ^+h h^+ - h^3+^+(h^+)^3  , where all parameters are assumed to be positive .",
    "@xmath33 is higgs doublet mass of the order of @xmath34  gev , while @xmath35 is mass of @xmath19 field .",
    "last term in ( [ 4pot ] ) mildly violates @xmath28 .",
    "it involves highest power of @xmath24 and therefore , between last three intersecting quartic terms , will be most suppressed .",
    "this is in a good accordance with a so - called naturalness issue @xcite . for @xmath36",
    ", system will have global minimum with non zero @xmath37 .",
    "the extremum conditions for ( [ 4pot ] ) will be :    @xmath38 _",

    "m^2(_1+_2)m^2  , one can easily obtain    v = m+om^3/m^2  ,   v = ^2v+om^5/m^4  .",
    "note , that although the mass of @xmath19 is much larger than @xmath39 , the hierarchy is not destabilized , because @xmath40 s vev in ( [ 4sol ] ) is tiny and quartic terms in ( [ 4pot ] ) practically do not affect @xmath39 .",
    "for @xmath24 s potential [ first term in ( [ 4pot ] ) ] we have used the simplest possible expression .",
    "the potential s form for sm doublet is not crucial , because vev of @xmath19 will have same magnitude as in ( [ 4sol ] ) .",
    "important is to achieve desirable electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking .",
    "since this issue is beyond the scope of this paper , we will assume that one of the mechanisms @xcite , @xcite , providing ew symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , for low scale theories , is applied .",
    "the natural hierarchy between ew and fundamental scales can be achieved if ewsb occurs dynamically @xcite , wile susy theories ( which we consider below ) guarantee stability of the scales [ condition in ( [ cond ] ) ] .    using ( [ 4sol ] ) in ( [ 4nulag ] ) , for neutrino masses we will have    _",

    "smaller scale , relevant for solar neutrinos @xcite , can be obtained through suppressing the appropriate entries in @xmath45 .",
    "latter can be naturally realized through the flavor symmetries .",
    "if we wish to build scenario with lower fundamental scale , higher @xmath3 representations must be introduced .",
    "namely , if now @xmath19 is @xmath1-plet of @xmath3 with @xmath17 charge @xmath46 , then yukawa couplings , responsible for neutrino masses will be    _ = ll h^2+h.c .  , and",

    "it is easy to verify    vm  ,   v^3v  . using ( [ 5nulag ] ) and ( [ 5sol ] ) , for neutrino masses we will have    _ = _ v^2^5 ^3v  , which for @xmath48  ev , @xmath49 require relatively low scales @xmath50  tev .",
    "fundamental scale can be easily reduced even down to few tev , if @xmath19 belongs to @xmath51 representation of @xmath20 .",
