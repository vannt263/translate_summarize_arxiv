    "one of the spectacular predictions of quantum electrodynamics is the emergence of forces that arise purely from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum  @xcite .",
    "also known as london - van der waals  @xcite or casimir forces  @xcite in different regimes , these forces are often dominant at short distances and can give rise to undesirable effects in nanoscale systems , such as nanomechanical stiction  @xcite .",
    "these forces have also attracted increasing attention in the fields of atomic physics and quantum optics . in particular ,",
    "significant efforts have been made in recent years to interface cold atoms with the evanescent fields of dielectric micro- and nano - photonic systems  @xcite .",
    "these systems are expected to facilitate strong , tunable interactions between individual atoms and photons for applications such as quantum information processing  @xcite and the investigation of quantum many - body physics  @xcite . in practice",
    ", efficient atomic coupling to the evanescent fields of the nanophotonic systems requires that atoms be trapped within sub - wavelength distances of these structures .    at these scales",
    ", quantum vacuum forces can overwhelm the forces associated with conventional optical dipole traps , typically resulting in a loss of trap stability at distances @xmath0 nm from dielectric surfaces .",
    "given the ability to engineer the properties of nanophotonic structures , an interesting question arises as to whether such systems could be used to significantly modify vacuum forces , perhaps changing their sign from being attractive to repulsive , or even creating local potential minima .",
    "the strength of nanoscale vacuum forces should lead to unprecedented energy and length scales for atomic traps , which would find use beyond nanophotonic interfaces , such as in quantum simulation protocols based upon ultracold atoms  @xcite and control of inter - atomic interactions  @xcite .    here",
    "we propose a novel mechanism in which engineered vacuum forces can enable the formation of a nanoscale atomic trap . while a recent no - go theorem  @xcite forbids a vacuum trap for atoms in their electronic ground states , tailored nanophotonic systems can yield strong repulsive potentials for atomic excited states .",
    "we show that a weak external optical field can give rise to an overall trapping potential for a dressed state .",
    "remarkably , absent fundamental limits on the losses of the surrounding dielectric structure , the fraction of excited - state population in the dressed state can become infinitesimal , which greatly enhances the trapping lifetime and stability .",
    "we identify and carefully analyze the actual limiting mechanisms . while we present calculations on a simple model where analytical results can be obtained , we also discuss the generality of our protocol to realistic systems such as photonic crystal structures .    the no - go theorem for non - magnetic media states that a dielectric object in vacuum can not be stably trapped with vacuum forces for any surrounding configuration of dielectric objects , provided that the system is in thermal equilibrium  @xcite . in analogy with earnshaw s theorem , which prohibits trapping of charged objects with static electric potentials , at best",

    "potential loopholes involve embedding the system in a high - index fluid  @xcite , or using blackbody radiation pressure associated with strong temperature gradients  @xcite .",
    "applied to atoms , this theorem essentially forbids stable vacuum trapping near a dielectric structure when the atom is in its electronic ground state .",
    "no such constraint exists for atoms in their excited states  @xcite , although the robustness of any possible trap would be limited by the excited state lifetime . here",
    ", we show that an atom only weakly dressed by its excited state can be trapped by properly tailoring the dispersion of the underlying structure .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing how quantum vacuum fluctuations give rise to forces on the ground and excited states . within an effective two - level approximation of an isotropic atom with ground and excited states @xmath1  ( see appendix for description of how isotropy is incorporated into the model ) , the interaction between the electromagnetic field and an atom at position @xmath2 is given by the dipole hamiltonian @xmath3 . following a complete decomposition of the electric field into its normal modes @xmath4 , one can write @xmath5 , where @xmath6 . the energy non - conserving terms  ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) enable an atom in its ground state @xmath9 to couple virtually to the excited state and create a photon , @xmath10 , which is subsequently re - absorbed .",
    "the corresponding frequency shift for the ground state within second - order perturbation theory is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the unperturbed atomic transition frequency .",
    "this shift results in a mechanical `` vacuum '' potential when translational symmetry is broken due to dielectric surfaces . using a quantization technique for electrodynamics in the presence of dispersive dielectric media ,",
    "the shift can be expressed in terms of the scattered component of the dyadic electromagnetic green s function evaluated at imaginary frequencies @xmath13  @xcite  ( see appendix ) , _",
    "g()=_0^dug_(,,iu ) , where @xmath14 is the free - space spontaneous emission rate of the atom .    a similar process can occur for an atom in its excited state @xmath15 , in which the atom virtually emits and re - absorbs an off - resonant photon  ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "however , the excited state is unique in that it can also emit a resonant photon .",
    "the total excited state shift is given by  @xcite _ e()=--g_(,,_0).[eq : omegae ] the first term on the right arises from off - resonant processes , while the second term can be interpreted as the interaction between the atom and its own resonantly emitted photon .",
    "naturally , the dielectric environment can modify the spontaneous emission rate as well , ( ) = _ 0+g_(,,_0).[eq : gamma ] note that the modified emission and resonant shifts are complementary in that they emerge from different quadratures of the green s function .",
    "the versatility of micro- and nanophotonic systems has already been exploited to greatly modify emission rates of atoms and molecules in a variety of contexts  @xcite .",
    "we propose that these same systems can be used to tailor excited - state potentials in order to facilitate vacuum trapping .",
    "of course , the excited - state shift can be affected by coupling to even higher electronic levels . however , since our goal is to engineer giant resonant shifts of @xmath17 , the off - resonant couplings to higher - lying states yield only minor corrections and consequently are ignored here .",
    "in what follows , we present a simple model system that enables one - dimensional trapping in a plane parallel to a semi - infinite dielectric slab , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] . the use of a homogeneous dielectric  ( as opposed to , _",
    "e.g. _ , a photonic crystal ) greatly simplifies the calculation and enables one to understand the relevant trap properties analytically , although we later argue why the qualitative features should still hold in more complex geometries . in the dielectric slab model , dispersion engineering will be realized via the frequency - dependent electric permittivity @xmath18 .",
    "while this particular system achieves a one - dimensional trap along @xmath19 , our electrodynamic calculations are performed in three dimensions .",
    "enables large repulsion in the excited state @xmath20 , in contrast to the attractive vacuum potential experienced by an atom in its ground state .",
    "an overall trapping potential normal to the surface ( along @xmath19 ) can be generated by driving the atom with an external laser of frequency @xmath21 , which is greater than the natural resonance frequency @xmath12 of the atom .",
    "the laser comes into local resonance with the atom at @xmath22 .",
    "an atom far from @xmath22 is unaffected by the largely detuned field and feels an attractive force @xmath23 toward the dielectric interface .",

    "this creates an atomic dressed state , whose excited state component yields a net repulsive force on the atom .",
    "c ) a slowly moving atom experiences the adiabatic dressed state potential @xmath25 shown in red , which characterizes the position - dependent mixing between ground and excited states .",
    "the minimum of the dressed potential is located at @xmath26.[fig : schematic],width=491 ]",
    "a short - distance expansion of the green s function , valid for sub - wavelength scales , shows that the excited - state emission rate @xmath27 and resonant contribution @xmath28 to the shift are given by & & ( ) , [ eq : gammageneral ] + & & -(),[eq : omegaegeneral ] where the permittivity @xmath29 is evaluated at the atomic resonance frequency , @xmath19 is the distance from the surface , and @xmath30 is the resonant free - space wavevector .",
    "a large repulsive potential is generated when @xmath31 , which is analogous to the interaction between a classical dipole at position @xmath19 and its large induced image dipole in the dielectric .",
    "the modified spontaneous emission rate originates from the absorption or quenching of the atomic emission due to material losses .",
    "we choose a drude model , @xmath32 , as a simple dielectric function .",
    "note that this function satisfies kramers - kronig relations  ( causality ) , as a choice of a non - causal function could result in an apparent violation of the no - go theorem  @xcite as well . in the limit of vanishing material loss parameter @xmath33",

    "the dispersion and dissipation scale like @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "thus , for high @xmath38 , it is possible to choose detunings where the atom still sees significant repulsive forces , but where spontaneous emission into the material is not significantly enhanced  ( in addition to material - induced emission of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammageneral ] ) , there still is emission into free - space at a rate @xmath44 ) .",
    "this scaling behavior is in close analogy with conventional optical trapping of atoms , where simultaneously using large trapping intensity and detuning maintains reasonable trap depths but suppresses unwanted photon scattering .",
    "the ground - state shift for atomic frequencies @xmath45 and in the near - field is given by @xmath46 .",
    "we now describe how a trap can form for an atom subject to these potentials , and in the presence of a weak driving laser of frequency @xmath21 and rabi frequency @xmath47  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) . for conceptual simplicity ,",
    "we choose the rabi frequency to be spatially uniform , such that all atomic forces are attributable to the vacuum potentials alone .",
    "qualitatively , the strong position dependence of the ground and excited state frequencies causes the laser to come into resonance with the atom at a single , tunable point @xmath48 . under certain conditions  ( described in detail later )",
    ", an atom starting at position @xmath49 will be far detuned , such that it is essentially in the ground state and is attracted by the pure ground - state potential .",
    "however , moving closer to @xmath22 brings the atom closer to resonance .",
    "the dressing of the atom with a small fraction of excited state population causes a repulsive barrier to form near @xmath50 , yielding a metastable trap .",
    "significantly , our approach does not attempt to directly counteract the attractive ground - state potential with large external optical potentials , in sharp contrast with other trapping schemes near dielectric surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the order of our calculation of the trap properties is as follows .",
    "we first find the adiabatic potential experienced by a slowly - moving atom .",
    "we derive relevant properties around the location of the trap minimum @xmath51  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "in particular , we show that absent material constraints  ( arbitrarily high @xmath38 ) , the dressed state can in principle have infinitesimal excited state population and scattering .",
    "we then quantize the motion to find the motional eigenstates , binding energy , and position uncertainty @xmath52 .",
    "finally , we analyze the mechanisms that limit the trap lifetime .    first treating the motion classically",
    ", the force experienced by the atom is given by @xmath53 , while the internal atomic dynamics satisfies the usual bloch equations , _",
    "e.g. _ , = ( i_a(z)-(z)/2)_ge+i(_ee-_gg)[eq : bloch ] . here",
    "@xmath54 is the detuning between the laser and the local atomic resonance frequency .",
    "when the atom moves slowly on the time scales of the internal dynamics , the atomic coherence can be adiabatically eliminated , @xmath55 , such that the atomic populations are functions of position alone , @xmath56 .",
    "we are primarily interested in the regime where the atom is weakly driven , @xmath57 .",
    "a more careful calculation reveals that the green s function @xmath58 for the excited state resonant shift and emission rate in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : omegae ] ) and  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) must in fact be evaluated at the laser frequency in this regime , which reflects that the atom primarily acts as a rayleigh scatterer  ( see appendix ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath59 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gammageneral ] ) and  ( [ eq : omegaegeneral ] ) is replaced with @xmath60 .",
    "the adiabatic potential seen by a slowly - moving atom is @xmath61 .",
    "three independent frequencies characterize the system  ( @xmath62 , and @xmath63 ) , and two relative frequencies must be specified .",
    "one is determined by selecting the trap barrier position , determined by the relation @xmath64 .",
    "a second is the dimensionless detuning between the plasmon resonance and laser , @xmath65 , which we treat as a free parameter that determines the relative strengths of the excited state shift and dissipation . in the near - field ,",
    "the excited state repulsion exceeds the ground state attraction by a factor @xmath66 .",
    "the population at @xmath22 must then exceed the inverse of this quantity , @xmath67 , in order to provide a classical barrier in the adiabatic potential , which translates to a minimum rabi frequency @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath69 , this scheme potentially enables atom trapping near surfaces with greatly reduced intensities as compared to conventional trapping . in the latter case",
    ", an optical dipole potential requires a minimum driving field of @xmath70 to overcome the attractive ground state potential .",
    "the excited - state population at the trap minimum is fixed by the ratio of ground to excited state forces , @xmath71 , and is surprisingly independent of @xmath47  ( provided that @xmath72 ) .",
    "an increasing rabi frequency has the effect of increasing the local detuning @xmath73 to preserve the same population .",
    "this manifests itself as a `` self - selection '' of the trapping position and an increasing distance from the barrier , ( ^2 - 1)^1/2 , where we have defined the dimensionless rabi frequency @xmath74 .",
    "the photon scattering rate at the trap position , @xmath75 , leads to lifetime limitations of our trapping scheme .",
    "fixing other parameters , the detuning @xmath76 from the plasmon resonance can be optimized to yield the minimum scattering rate , @xmath77 .",
    "thus , absent fundamental limitations to the magnitude of @xmath38 , the photon scattering rate can in principle be suppressed to an arbitrary degree .",
    "this implies that an `` infinitesimal '' violation of the assumptions underlying the no - go theorem can in fact allow for trapping .    in a conventional optical dipole trap ,",
    "the potential @xmath78 seen by an atom depends on the local field intensity and is proportional to a spatially - constant atomic polarizability evaluated at the laser frequency .",
    "in contrast , here we exploit a novel mechanism arising from strong spatial variations in the polarizability itself , induced through the vacuum level shifts .",
    "this creates a back - action effect analogous to that producing a dynamical `` optical spring '' in opto - mechanical systems  @xcite , and enables extremely steep trap barriers around @xmath22  ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic]c ) . in particular , the repulsive force is given by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is engineered to be large .",
    "however , the excited state population @xmath81 itself varies strongly with position through the spatially - dependent detuning  ( for simplicity , here we omit the varying linewidth @xmath27 ) .",

    "this idealized model enables one to understand the best possible scaling of the trap properties .",

    "tunneling is exponentially suppressed with barrier height and thus is easily suppressed with increasing rabi frequency .",
    "this calculation can be found in the appendix , while we discuss the more important mechanisms here .    as in conventional optical trapping ,",
    "the random momentum recoil imparted on the atom by scattered photons yields an increase in motional energy at the rate @xmath103 .",
    "two qualitative differences emerge relative to free space , however .",
    "first , the photon scattering rate @xmath104 is modified in the presence of dielectric surfaces .",
    "second , the effective momentum @xmath105 imparted by a photon is enhanced compared to the free - space momentum .",
    "this momentum scales at close distances like @xmath106  ( see appendix ) , due to emission into high - wavevector photons in the dielectric . starting from the motional ground state ,",
    "this heating causes the atom to become unbound over a time scale @xmath107 .",
    "it should be noted that the heating rate @xmath108 does not depend on the atom confinement  ( _ i.e. _ , whether we operate in the lamb - dicke limit ) , as the suppression of motional jumps in tight traps is compensated by the increase in energy gained per jump  @xcite .",
    "our derivation of the atomic potential assumes that the atomic coherence adjusts rapidly to the local trap properties , @xmath109 , which results in a purely conservative potential . as we now show , non - adiabatic corrections result in a momentum - dependent force , @xmath110  ( anti - damping ) .",
    "we can solve eq .",

    "the heating rate is exactly analogous to that occurring in an opto - mechanical system in the blue - detuned regime  @xcite .",
    "we define a characteristic time @xmath120 needed for the energy increase produced by anti - damping to equal the ground - state binding energy @xmath85 .",
    "thus far , we have focused on the motion of the atomic dressed state , in which a trap emerges due to weak mixing with the excited state potential . following a spontaneous emission event",
    ", however , the atom returns to the ground state and sees the pure ground - state potential for a transient time @xmath121 until the atomic coherence is restored , during which the atomic wave - packet accelerates toward the surface and gains energy . while a simulation of the full dynamics of the atom  ( including the spatial and internal degrees of freedom ) is quite challenging , here we estimate the heating rate from these transient processes . in particular , we first find the spatial propagator under the pure ground - state potential , @xmath122  ( see appendix ) .",

    "here we have assumed a plamson resonance quality factor of @xmath102 and atomic properties corresponding to cesium .",
    "[ fig : lifetime],width=302 ]",
    "we have described a protocol for an atomic trap based upon engineered vacuum forces , and have analyzed in detail a model case of one - dimensional trapping near a drude material , where analytical results are possible to obtain .",
    "the drude response approximates well a number of metals , such as silver and gold , in the optical domain  @xcite . in practice , however , these metals are limited by their low quality factors  ( @xmath136 ) , and the thermal fluctuations of such conducting materials can give rise to strong noise - induced trap heating and decoherence  @xcite . on the other hand , photonic crystal structures enable engineering of resonances through geometry , and quality factors approaching @xmath137 have been observed  @xcite . while the field profiles of such structures are more complex , we anticipate that our trapping protocol could be quite generally applied , and the resulting trap behavior would qualitatively remain the same . in particular , the scaling of the engineered excited - state shift  ( @xmath138 ) and dissipation  ( @xmath139 ) are generic to coupling between an atom and resonator , and only the spatial dependence is determined by the field profiles .",
    "photonic crystals should thus offer great flexibility in tailoring the properties of vacuum traps  ( such as dimensionality ) , which we plan to investigate in detail in future work .",
    "we note that related efforts have already been made to design realistic hybrid atom traps in photonic crystal structures , where a combination of vacuum forces and optical forces are required to stabilize the trap in all dimensions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , while we have focused on trapping of atoms weakly dressed by an external laser , it should also be possible to achieve laser - free traps by using atoms pumped into metastable electronic levels and engineering resonant shifts .    the ability to create atomic traps with parameter sets  ( such as depth , confinement , and proximity to surfaces ) that are not possible in conventional traps  ( whether optical , electrical , or magnetic ) should lead to a number of intriguing applications .",
    "for example , it has been proposed that the trapping of atoms near dielectric surfaces with nano - scale features  ( such as a sub - wavelength lattice ) would facilitate large interaction strengths and long - range interactions for ultracold atoms  @xcite . however , the major limitation of optical trapping is the divergent intensity needed to overcome the ground - state vacuum forces of these structures .",
    "the use of resonantly - enhanced excited state repulsion to create a trap could significantly reduce the power requirements and enable smaller lattice constants .",
    "furthermore , traps with localization on the nanometer scale can induce inter - atomic forces that are of comparable strength to molecular van der waals forces , which enables novel opportunities to control ultracold atomic collisions  @xcite and realize exotic interactions such as @xmath140-wave scattering of fermions  @xcite .",
