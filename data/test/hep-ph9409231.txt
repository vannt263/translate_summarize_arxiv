    "the lowest glueball has a mass of about 1.5  gev .",
    "this means that correlations below this scale should vanish .",
    "we then treat the interactions of quarks below this scale as pointlike .",
    "it can also be seen as the first terms in an expansion in local terms after integrating out fully ( or only the short distance part ) of the gluons .",
    "these are in fact all terms up to dimension 6 to leading order in @xmath0 .",

    "these are valid in all schemes where the one - loop functions are obtained from a heat kernel like expansion and have thus a rather broad range of validity .",
    "in particular , they remain valid at finite temperatures and densities .",
    "we discuss in this section as an example the pseudoscalar - vector - vector 3-point function .",
    "this has all the interesting features plus the occurrence of the flavour anomaly .",
    "the general diagram is a one - loop triangle diagram with a chain with 0,1,2,3,  one - loop ( like in fig .",
    "[ fig2pt]a ) connected to all three corners .",
    "the two vector legs can be easily resummed leading to an expression like : @xmath37 the resummation of the external leg leads immediately to a vmd - like formula in terms of slowly varying functions of the momenta .",
    "a similar expression is valid for the other vector leg .",
    "the pseudoscalar leg can mix with the longitudinal axial - vector degree of freedom leading to a sum of two terms . both with a pole at the pseudoscalar mass .",
    "naive use of the current identity @xmath38 would lead to only the pseudoscalar term multiplied by @xmath39 .",
    "it is in this way that this resummation method sees the mixing of the pion and the axial - vector that occurs in this method .",
    "in fact two more effects should be taken into account .",
    "the current identity is used in a three - point function so there are usually also terms from the equal - time commutators and there are additional terms in the current identity due to the anomaly .",
    "these latter are very important in obtaining results that have the correct qcd flavour anomaly @xcite .",
    "the final result for the pvv two - point function with momenta @xmath40 for the vector legs is : @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 the function @xmath44 is essentially the chiral quark loop result .",
    "so analytically we only have a part that is multiplied by the expected vector - meson - dominance factors .",
    "there is a second part that is not , that came from the extra terms in the current identity .",
    "this behaviour is in fact very welcome .",
    "we have both the one - loop quark contribution to the slopes and the one from vector meson dominance .",
    "since both of these explain the observed slopes having both fully would not agree with experiment .",
    "here we have , however @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 with @xmath50@xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath46 @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "as we see we have good numerical agreement with the observed slope and the corrections due to finite meson mass are substantially smaller than in the chiral quark model .",
    "the latter is also desirable since otherwise there would have been extremely large corrections to the @xmath56 decay .",
    "as shown in the previous two sections the appearance of meson dominance like formulas with slowly varying couplings is a natural feature of this model and as such the successful phenomenology of this concept is taken over .",
    "the model does combine this together with a set of chiral quark loop effects in a kind of interpolating fashion thus incorporating the strengths of both approaches .",
    "the final results can be plotted to check whether the final formulas also have a vmd - like behaviour and as shown in section 5 in @xcite this is numerically the case for all the 2 and 3-point functions studied there .",
    "we have in general stayed in the euclidean domain of momenta to avoid the problem that this model does not include confinement .",
    "there the sign of meson dominance is that inverse formfactors are straight lines as a function of the various @xmath28 .",
    "this we find indeed .",
    "we have treated the enjl model in leading order in @xmath0 as an a low - energy expansion for a general green function via chiral perturbation theory and all 2-point functions and a few 3-point functions to all orders in quark masses and momenta .",
