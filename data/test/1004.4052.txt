    "the time - dependent properties of semiconductor nanostructures and their response to electric pulses are currently being studied through transient current measurements and in a pump - and - probe configuration.@xcite along with these experimental developments theoretical schemes for the description of time - dependent transport emerged .",
    "the methods include the non - equilibrium keldysh - green function formalism,@xcite scattering theory , @xcite and more recently the generalized master equation ( gme ) adapted for electronic transport.@xcite    these methods were used mostly for studying the transient currents generated by a time - dependent potential applied on the sample or by a time - dependent coupling between the leads and the sample .",
    "an example in the first category is the time dependent pumping of electrons through a small open system.@xcite in the second category we mention the transient currents and the geometrical effects imposed by the lateral confinement of the sample.@xcite in another recent work we investigated the modulation of the drain current when a sequence of square pulses is applied to the source probe connected to a quantum dot and a short quantum wire described within lattice model.@xcite that study was motivated by the experiments of naser _",
    "et al_.@xcite    in the present work we further exploit the gme method and study the transport properties of a quantum wire operating in a turnstile regime .",
    "the turnstile pump is a single - electron device where the sample is periodically connected and disconnected with the left and right lead respectively , but with a relative phase shift .",
    "it was experimentally created by kouwenhoven _",
    "et al._@xcite by modulating in time the two tunneling barriers between a quantum dot and two leads .",
    "the electrons were driven by a finite bias between the leads .",
    "this setup is different from a quantum pump where a current is generated by asymmetric external oscillations , but without a bias . in the experiment of kouwenhoven _",
    "the barrier heights oscillate out of phase in the following sense : on the first half - cycle electrons enter from the source probe in the system but there is no current in the drain probe because the corresponding tunneling barrier is high enough to prevent this . in the second half - cycle",
    "the source is disconnected , the drain contact opens , and a discharge of the dot follows .",
    "it was found that an integer number of electrons are transmitted through the structure in each pumping cycle .",
    "more recently , due to the general interest in applications of nanoelectronic devices , more complex turnstile pumps have been studied by numerical simulations , like one - dimensional arrays of junctions @xcite or two - dimensional multidot systems .",
    "@xcite in the present paper we predict that the turnstile operation can also be performed in a quantum wire sample and in an external magnetic field as well . our results are obtained using a parabolic lateral confinement model both for the quantum wire and for the leads .",
    "we put a special effort on describing the lead - sample contacts . in a previous work we studied the turnstile transport through a sample described by a lattice ( tight - binding ) model .",
    "the sample was a one - dimensional system with two or three sites and the transport calculations were done using nonequilibrium keldysh - green functions.@xcite the quantum wire considered in this work is much more complex .",
    "we start from the single - particle hamiltonian of a two - dimensional wire of length @xmath0 parabolically confined along the @xmath1 direction and with hard - wall conditions at @xmath2 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian were described in detail in ref .   and will not be repeated here .",
    "the material is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we briefly review the main equations of the model and of the gme method , section [ calc ] is devoted to the numerical results for zero magnetic field ( [ beq0 ] ) , in the presence of a magnetic field ( [ bne0 ] ) , and to the edge states ( [ es ] ) .",
    "the conclusion are given in section [ conc ] .",
    "we consider an isolated finite quantum wire of length @xmath3 nm , extended in the @xmath4-direction .",
    "the width of the wire is defined by a parabolic confinement potential in the @xmath1-direction with the characteristic energy @xmath5 mev .",
    "the quantum wire is terminated at @xmath2 with hard wall potentials .",
    "in addition , we have two semi - infinite leads , one extended from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and the other one from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . both have a parabolic confinement in the @xmath1 direction with an energy of 0.8 mev , and are also terminated at @xmath2 with hard walls .",
    "the leads and the finite quantum wire , or the system , are all subjected to an external constant magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "the length of the wire , @xmath0 , and the magnetic length modified by the parabolic confinement @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and the cyclotron frequency @xmath13 , are convenient length scales in the calculations .",
    "we assume the gaas effective mass , @xmath14 .",

    "( [ t_aq ] ) and ( [ gl ] ) , is a convenient way of describing the coupling . in our calculations these coupling parameters",
    "will be the same for both leads and hence the label @xmath38 will be omitted .",
    "the system can be subjected to a bias @xmath39 and in order to reduce the number of many - electron states ( mes ) to a reasonable number in the following calculations we limit the number of single - electron states ( ses ) for the particular calculation by selecting a window of relevant states around the bias window , i.e.  @xmath40 $ ] , such that the transport properties are not changed significantly by extending the window .",
    "we consider these states relevant for the transport , or `` active '' , while all the other states are `` frozen '' , being either permanently occupied or permanently empty .",
    "in addition to the electrons frozen in the states below the active window ( which are not included in the transport calculation ) , we also assume the lowest active state occupied at the moment @xmath26",
    "_ i.  e. _  when the contacts begin to operate . in this way",
    "the transient phase is shorter than if we would assume an empty active window , and we can spend less computing time until the system reaches the periodic state .",

    "( [ current ] ) is given by the left hand side of the gme , eq .",
    "( [ gme ] ) , and the partial currents associated to each ses and each lead correspond to the terms of the sum on the right hand side ( the trace of the commutator of @xmath53 and @xmath54 is zero ) .",
    "the functions which modulate the coupling between the leads and the quantum wire are built in the following way : for @xmath55 we use the fermi - like function @xmath56 , with @xmath57 ps@xmath58 , and we define @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the lead index . then , for @xmath61 , @xmath28 become step - like functions alternating between 0 and 1 , both with the same period @xmath62 , but with a delay of @xmath63 . in this way we mimic the on / off contact switching done in the turnstile experiments .",
    "we choose @xmath64 , which means we first switch off the left contact while the right one is still on .",
    "then the left is turned on again while the right is turned off , and so on .",
    "the energy spectrum of the leads and of the sample are shown in fig.[elev ] .",
    "the leads have parabolic subbands while the sample has discrete levels .",
    "the maximum energy for each subband shown in the graph indicates the corresponding maximum wave vector in the @xmath65-integration of the gme .",
    "the chemical potentials in the leads defining the bias window ( bw ) are shown with the dashed horizontal lines .",
    "we consider two bw s : bw1 with chemical potentials @xmath66 mev and @xmath67 mev , and bw2 with @xmath68 mev and @xmath69 mev respectively . in both cases the applied bias is @xmath70 mev . in the numerical calculations of the reduced statistical operator",
    "we also include the sample states with energy outside the bw , between the limits @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath73 mev .",
    "the first active window contains 4 sess and the second one contains 5 sess .    in fig .",
    "[ occup1 ] we show the time - dependent total occupation @xmath74 of the relevant ( active ) ses for bw1 and bw2 .",
    "the electrons occupying the states situated below the active windows are not included , but only those on the relevant states ( or within the active windows ) . in this example",
    "the parameters characterizing the coupling of the sample to the leads are @xmath75 mev ( with @xmath76 measured in nm ) , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "the large value for @xmath79 is consistent with the small overlap of the wave functions from the lead and from the sample mandated by the large values for @xmath80 and @xmath81 . the largest contribution to",
    "the overlap comes from the `` contact '' area within one @xmath76 around the ends of the finite quantum wire at @xmath82 .",
    "the unusual dimension of @xmath83 , which is @xmath84 is a result of different dimensions of the wave functions in the lead and in the sample : the former is @xmath85 , being unbounded in the direction along the lead , and the later is @xmath86 .",
    "we also select @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ gl ] ) .",
    "the time - dependent switching functions @xmath28 are also shown in the figure , with period @xmath88 ps , for @xmath60 .    comparing the charge oscillation for the first and for the second active window we see that more charge is transferred through the system for bw2 than for bw1 .",
    "there are two reasons for that .",
    "one reason is that bw2 includes three subbands of the leads , whereas bw1 includes only two ( fig .  [ elev ] ) .",
    "the second reason is that the energy dispersion in each subband increases with increasing energy , such that the electrons have higher speed in bw2 than in bw1 , and thus an increased contribution to conduction .",
    "it is interesting to observe the behavior of the states situated at the boundaries of the bw . to show that we choose the bw1 and display in fig .",
    "[ current1]a the partial currents created by each sample state included in the calculation .",
    "these are the states 2,3,4,5 in the order of the energy , shown with dots in fig .",
    "state 1 ( the lowest dot ) is considered totally occupied and frozen . in this case",
    "state 2 is slightly below the window , state 3 is within the window , and states 4 and 5 are slightly above the window . in fig .",
    "[ current1]b we show the same partial currents , but now for a slightly higher chemical potential of the left lead , @xmath89 mev , instead of @xmath90 mev used in fig .",
    "[ current1]a .",
    "the state number 4 is now included in the bw and consequently the corresponding current increases .",
    "the current of the state 5 also increases a little bit , while the current associated to the other states does not change .",
    "a similar behavior is displayed by state number 9 situated on top of bw2 ( not shown ) .",
    "the efficiency of the turnstile operation depends on the pulse length @xmath62 .",
    "the previous results are obtained with @xmath88 ps . in those setups the system transfers at least two electrons per cycle .",
    "the present gme method is valid in the lowest ( quadratic ) order of the lead - sample coupling , which means the tunneling of the electrons from the leads to the sample and back is a relatively slow process .",
    "therefore by increasing or decreasing the pulse duration the transferred charge increases or decreases respectively . denoting by @xmath91 the characteristic tunneling time , if @xmath92 the turnstile operation is not expected to work , the allowed time for the charging and discharging of the system being too short .",
    "this is the case for @xmath93 ps as shown in fig .",
    "[ occup2 ] , when clearly very little charge can enter and leave the system in a pumping cycle . actually , the time @xmath91 depends on the pairwise coupling ( or overlap ) of each state of the leads to each state of the sample with energies within the bw .",
    "but in order to obtain significant pumping effects , the pulse duration has to include the time of flight ( or propagation time ) of electrons along the wire .",
    "this extra time depends on the energy of the electrons injected from the left lead all the way into the right lead .",
    "therefore , for a longer pulse , @xmath94 ps , the turnstile pumping process is able to transfer charge through the sample .",
    "the occupation number has a triangular shape in time and it becomes periodic after 2 - 3 cycles . during the initial cycle , which includes the initial charging phase , the system accumulates more than 2 electrons and the steady state is already reached at about 30 ps when the charge in the system is saturated .",
    "this is possible because the right contact is still off .",
    "the right contact opens for the first time at 45 ps allowing more than 1 electron charge to pass into the right lead . for a longer period , like @xmath88 ps",
    ", the occupation number develops toward a saw - tooth profile typical for the charging / relaxation processes .",
    "the asymmetry of the charge peaks is determined by the direction of the bias : the electrons leave the sample faster than they entered .",
    "the system drives almost two electrons from one lead into the other , which is remarkable given the length of our sample ( 300 nm ) .",
    "t and two values of the coupling strength .",

    "intermediate : @xmath95 mev , @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "strong : @xmath100 mev , @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "the pulse period is @xmath88 ps.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    another important aspect in our model is the strength of the lead - sample coupling , _ i.  e. _  the parameters @xmath83 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 in eq.([toperator ] ) .",
    "our gme implementation is restricted to the lowest order in @xmath43 ( quadratic ) , supplying the integro - differential equation ( [ gme ] ) , and thus the parameters have to be appropriately selected . in general",
    "it is difficult to evaluate whether the coupling strength is sufficiently low .",
    "a necessary ( although not sufficient ) condition is to obtain positive diagonal elements of the statistical operator , which are the populations of the mes and hence probabilities .",
    "although we always check in our calculations , strictly speaking this condition does not guarantee the validity of the lowest order approximation ( quadratic in @xmath43 ) .",
    "so in practice we can not avoid choosing our parameters in a semi - empirical manner .",
    "to have an idea about the relation between the pumping amplitude and the coupling strength we show in fig .",
    "[ strengthb0 ] three calculations done with three strengths of the coupling , which we consider in relative terms weak , intermediate , and strong . in order to compare with the results obtained in the presence of a magnetic field shown in the next examples ,",
    "the scaled parameters @xmath79 and @xmath103 are chosen such that the _ physical _ values @xmath83 and @xmath104 are the same as for @xmath105 t. the time dependent occupation of the states in the active window is shown for longer times than in the previous figures to indicate better the final periodic regime .",
    "it is not surprising to see that the pumping amplitude increases with the coupling strength , since tunneling of electrons becomes more likely .",
    "the same can be said about the current , which is essentially the time derivative of the charge , and it is visible in fig .",
    "[ strengthb0 ] that the slope of the charge increases with the coupling strength .",
    "the increase of the transient current with the coupling strength has also been shown recently by sasaoka _",
    "_ although in a quantum dot pumping device .",
    "@xcite      following our ansatz used to describe the system - leads coupling , eqs .",
    "( [ t_aq])-([gl ] ) , we can visualize systems where the physical parameters @xmath83 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 should be assumed constant , and others where the scaled values @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 should be kept constant with changing values of the magnetic field rather . in the following",
    "we explore both possibilities .",
    "our choice of @xmath87 depends also on the value of the magnetic field , but we have checked that variations of this parameter between a scaled version and a fixed physical one will only lead to vanishing quantitative changes in calculations where we consider a range in the @xmath25 integration of the gme ( [ gme ] ) that includes 4 subbands of the leads .",
    "this choice of @xmath106 guarantees always the same number of subbands in the calculation .    in the presence of a magnetic field , in a first approximation one might expect the amplitude of the charge oscillations to decrease .",
    "the reason being that the electronic trajectories bend due to the lorentz force and the electrons might return to the source lead rather than traveling directly to the drain lead . at the same time we know that a magnetic field generally reduces backscattering . in fig .  [ occupb1 ] where we show the time dependent total charge for different values of the magnetic field we see a reduction of the charge oscillations with increasing magnetic field . for comparison we include the @xmath107 case , also shown in fig .  [ occup1 ] and fig .  [ occup2 ] . to compare the results with and without magnetic field",
    "we initially keep the same coupling parameters as measured with respect to the modified magnetic length , @xmath76 , i.  e.  @xmath108 , mev @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "the modified magnetic length @xmath76 decreases with increasing magnetic field , as do the features of the wave functions .",
    "we select the bias windows like bw2 , with three states included in the window and two marginal states in the extended regions .",
    "the energy levels and the wave functions depend on the strength of the magnetic field both in the sample and in the leads . in order to make the comparison shown in fig .",
    "[ occupb1 ] meaningful for each value of the magnetic field we shift the chemical potentials in the leads such that the same energy levels of the quantum wire sample are contained in the bias window with a fixed width .",
    "the efficiency of the turnstile pump tends to decrease with increasing the magnetic field .",
    "for @xmath107 an amount of charge @xmath109 electron can be transmitted along the wire sample in one cycle , and for @xmath110 t @xmath111 . for stronger magnetic fields @xmath112 drops to 0.8 for @xmath113 t , and @xmath114 at @xmath115 t.",
    "it is also clear that , at least for the present coupling parameters , the charging time increases in the presence of the magnetic field . during the initial cycle , _",
    "i.  e. _  for @xmath116 ps , there is less charge accumulated in the system in the normal switching regime than for @xmath107 , and also the charging process continues even after the pumping begins .",
    "the periodic regime is reached after a number of cycles which increases with @xmath117 .",
    "although the presence of the magnetic field reduces the electron transfer , the pumped charge still increases with increasing coupling between the leads and the sample . to show that we solve the gme for a fixed magnetic field @xmath105 t for three sets of coupling parameters , which we again call ( in relative terms ) weak , intermediate , and strong coupling , respectively , see fig .",
    "[ occupbcoupling ] .",
    "the parameters for the weak coupling are the same as in fig .",
    "[ occupb1 ] . for the intermediate coupling we use @xmath118 mev , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "for the strong coupling @xmath121 mev , @xmath122 , and @xmath120 .",
    "these parameters correspond to the same physical parameters that were used in fig .",
    "[ strengthb0 ] .",
    "so , if we now compare the results at @xmath105 t with the results at @xmath107 we see quite similar charge amplitudes , but somewhat more sensitive to the coupling strength at @xmath105 t. for example , at @xmath105 t we obtain @xmath123 electrons at low coupling , @xmath111 at intermediate coupling , and @xmath124 at strong coupling . for @xmath107 these numbers",
    "are @xmath125 , and @xmath126 , as can be read from fig .",
    "[ strengthb0 ] .",
    "we believe the increased sensitivity of the pumping to the contact strength in the presence of the magnetic field is a result of the edge states created in the sample .",
    "the edge states are indeed more and more pronounced with increasing magnetic field , and so is the pumped charge if the edge states are in good overlap with the coupling region .",
    "therefore with magnetic fields of about 1 t and strong coupling we can obtain @xmath127 of about 2 electrons , fig .",

    "the currents have a trapezoidal shape for the pulse duration @xmath130 ps , but they become triangular for shorter pulses like @xmath93 ps ( not shown ) .",

    "[ occupbstrong ] , only for the lowest subband of the leads .",
    "the general trend of the coupling coefficients is to decrease with increasing magnetic field .",
    "so the decrease of the pumping when the magnetic field increases can be explained by the decrease of the coupling strength .",

    "this system is far more complex than the simple two- or three - level system with one - dimensional leads considered in an earlier publication based on the keldysh - green functions approach.@xcite the eigenstates of the leads and of the finite wire have been calculated in an external perpendicular magnetic field using a combination of analytical and numerical methods for large functional basis sets .",
    "we have taken into account the subband structure of the leads to which it is attached .",
    "we have also described phenomenologically the coupling coupling between the states in the leads and the states in the finite wire as a nonlocal overlap of the wave functions from both sides of the contact .",
    "we have analyzed the effects of the bias window , pulse length , and magnetic field on the evolution in time of the number of electrons in the sample .",
    "we have found that longer pulses are more favorable for the turnstile pumping as the electrons need time to propagate along the sample wire .",
    "one or two electrons could be transferred through the 300 nm wire using pulses of 40 or 60 ps .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained with and without a magnetic field is a difficult issue .",
    "if a magnetic field is present all energies shift , all wave functions change ( both in the sample and in the leads ) , and also all elements of the coupling tensor @xmath135 between lead and sample states change . of",
    "course these changes depend on the strength of the field .",
    "therefore it is difficult to create similar conditions for two different field values , _",
    "i.  e. _  the same number of states in the bias window and the same coupling energies , in order to compare only the amplitude of the pumped charge . to do that we have selected the parameters describing the phenomenological coupling of the leads to the finite wire in two different ways , both scaled and not scaled with the effective width of the sample , which implicitly depends on the magnetic field .",
    "this is an issue that can only be better resolved with a more involved microscopic model of the coupling and comparison to experiments where the coupling strength could be varied , for example by using finger - strip gates .",
    "the charge distribution inside the system , fig .  [ chargedens ] , emphasizes the dynamics induced by the charging / discharging sequences .",
    "the charge propagation along edge - states in a strong magnetic field indicates that the optimal turnstile period depends on the external magnetic field .",
    "experimental studies of turnstile pumping in quantum wires have to clarify the relationship between the magnetic field , pumping amplitude , and contact strength .",
