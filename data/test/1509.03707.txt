    "the ultracold oh molecule is a versatile platform for precision measurements .",
    "its experimental appeal lies in the fact that its ground @xmath1 state is polar as well as paramagnetic , and is therefore readily manipulated in the laboratory with the use of electric and magnetic fields @xcite . applications explored thus far include precision spectroscopy @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite , in addition to studies of cold chemistry @xcite and quantum degeneracy @xcite .    in this article , we consider spin squeezing of the oh molecule .",
    "our discussion occurs in the context of the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xcite @xmath2 between the three components of the angular momentum operator @xmath3 .",
    "spin squeezing refers to a situation where the fluctuation in one of the components , say @xmath4 , is reduced to below the standard quantum limit @xmath5 .",
    "of course , the fluctuations in @xmath6 increase correspondingly , in order to maintain the relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hupj ] ) .",
    "spin squeezing constitutes a technique of interest at the frontiers of precision measurement and has applications in spectroscopy , magnetometry , metrology , the detection of particle correlation and entanglement , and quantum computation and simulation ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the pioneering start to spin squeezing was provided by the work of kitagawa and ueda @xcite and wineland et al .",
    "@xcite , who considered the squeezing of collective atomic spins , and was followed by many investigations ( @xcite , for example ) .",
    "we emphasize that all of this work relates to ensembles of correlated ( pseudo)spins , represented by atoms ( in a thermal vapor or a degenerate gas ) , nuclei @xcite , or molecules @xcite , where the collective spin can assume a high value @xcite .",
    "more recently , squeezing has also been considered for single ( atomic or nuclear ) spins , or equivalently , for an uncorrelated ensemble of such spins .",
    "experiments have been carried out , using spin @xmath7 @xcite and spin @xmath8 @xcite states of cesium atoms .",
    "possibilities also exist for dysprosium which offers states with spins from @xmath9 upto @xmath10 .",
    "theoretical calculations of single - spin squeezing have been presented as well @xcite .",
    "the squeezing in this case is limited by the much smaller angular momentum available . nonetheless , some effects can be experimentally relevant , for example for precision spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "motivated by such a consideration , we consider spin squeezing of a single oh molecule .",
    "interesting applications to the measurement of magnetic fields also seem possible @xcite , especially following recent discussions of magnetometry using single sic spins with angular momentum @xmath11 @xcite ; ground state ultracold",
    "oh also carries rotational angular momentum @xmath11 , and is sensitive to magnetic fields via the zeeman shift .",
    "as well , spin squeezing is related to the alignment - to - orientation transition @xcite , and we expect this perspective will be of relevance to our work , given the recent interest in the stereochemical properties of the oh molecule @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that compared to previous proposals for spin squeezing molecules @xcite , which employ spin @xmath0 interacting molecules squeezed collectively , we consider a single noninteracting molecule with angular momentum @xmath11 .    in present - day laboratories ,",
    "ultracold oh molecules are typically confined in magnetoelectrostatic traps @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider spin squeezing enabled by these readily available static electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the advantage of using static , rather than optical or microwave @xcite , fields for squeezing is that damping and decoherence due to spontaneous emission can be avoided .",
    "our starting point will be an effective eight - dimensional matrix hamiltonian that has been shown to model recent oh experiments quite well @xcite , and has also been diagonalized analytically @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that for zeeman and stark shifts small compared to the lambda - doublet splitting of the oh ground state , this hamiltonian can yield spin - squeezing of the types considered by kitagawa and ueda @xcite , law et al .",

    "the domain of validity of this hamiltonian and the details of the states involved can be found in several articles @xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "this effective hamiltonian was recently diagonalized analytically following the detection of an underlying chiral symmetry @xcite . in the process of identifying that symmetry",

    "( [ eq : cons ] ) must be divided by an @xmath15 .",
    "other formulas in this article can be handled in a similar manner .",
    "the generation of spin squeezing requires the presence of a nonlinearity , represented to lowest order by a term quadratic in one of the spin operators in the relevant hamiltonian @xcite . however , eq .  ( [ eq : ohham ] ) is linear in each of the spin operators",
    ". it may not be readily obvious that the coupled dynamics of the two spins can lead to squeezing , and it would assist our intuition if @xmath31 could be reduced , even if in some restricted regime , to the form of a spin squeezing hamiltonian familiar from the literature . in order to effect such a reduction , we proceed by identifying a regime in which the pseudospin @xmath0 can be eliminated adiabatically . as we show below , this results in an effective spin - squeezing hamiltonian for the spin @xmath11 degree of freedom .",
    "a similar procedure has been used earlier in the case of nuclear spin squeezing ; in that case however the eliminated spin is real @xcite .",
