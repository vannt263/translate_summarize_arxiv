    "with continual interest in expanding the performance envelope of engineering systems , nonlinear components are increasingly utilized in real - world applications .",
    "mitigating the resonant vibrations of nonlinear structures is therefore becoming a problem of great practical significance @xcite ; it is the focus of the present study .",
    "it also represents an important challenge , because nonlinear systems exhibit rich and complex phenomena , which linear systems can not .",
    "specifically , one key characteristic of nonlinear oscillations is that their frequency depends intrinsically on motion amplitude .",
    "nonlinear vibration absorbers , including the autoparametric vibration absorber @xcite , the nonlinear energy sink ( nes ) @xcite and other variants @xcite , can absorb disturbances in wide ranges of frequencies due to their increased bandwidth .",
    "for instance , it was shown that an nes , i.e. , an essentially nonlinear absorber , can extract energy from virtually any mode of a host structure @xcite .",
    "the nes can also carry out targeted energy transfer , which is an irreversible channeling of vibrational energy from the host structure to the absorber @xcite .",
    "this makes nonlinear vibration absorbers suitable candidates for vibration mitigation of nonlinear primary structures .",
    "however , the performance of existing nonlinear vibration absorbers is known to exhibit marked sensitivity to motion amplitudes .",
    "for instance , there exists a well - defined threshold of input energy below which no significant energy dissipation can be induced in an nes @xcite .",
    "likewise , the saturation phenomenon  characteristic of autoparametric vibration absorbers  occurs only when the forcing amplitude exceeds a certain threshold @xcite .",
    "this paper builds upon previous developments @xcite to introduce a nonlinear vibration absorber for mitigating the vibrations around a nonlinear resonance .",
    "the absorber is termed the nonlinear tuned vibration absorber ( nltva ) , because its nonlinear restoring force is tuned according to the nonlinear restoring force of the host structure .",
    "in other words , we propose to synthesize the absorber s load - deflection characteristic so that the nltva can mitigate the considered nonlinear resonance in wide ranges of motion amplitudes . in view of the existing literature on nonlinear vibration absorbers",
    ", this synthesis represents an unconventional aspect of this work .",
    "interestingly , this objective is similar in essence to what was achieved with centrifugal pendulum vibration absorbers in rotating machinery @xcite .",
    "because pendulum absorbers have a natural frequency that scales with the rate of rotation , they can be tuned over a continuous range of rotor speeds , e.g. , to follow an engine order line . in the same way ,",
    "lacarbonara et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a carefully - tuned secondary pendulating mass in order to reduce the vibrations of a planar pendulum in a relatively large interval of disturbance amplitudes .",
    "other studies looked at the influence of absorber nonlinearity on vibration suppression performance .",
    "for instance , two nonlinear damping mechanisms for a tuned mass damper were compared for the suppression of self - excited oscillations in @xcite .",
    "febbo and machado @xcite showed that a nonlinear absorber with saturable nonlinearity is more effective than a cubic nonlinearity for vibration mitigation of nonlinear primary oscillators .",
    "finally , agnes suggested to use softening ( hardening ) absorbers in the presence of hardening ( softening ) primary systems @xcite .",
    "another contribution of this research is to develop a nonlinear generalization of den hartog s equal - peak method which is widely used for designing linear vibration absorbers . the basic idea of the nonlinear tuning rule is to select the nonlinear coefficient of the absorber that ensures equal peaks in the nonlinear receptance function for an as large as possible range of forcing amplitudes .",
    "we will show that this is only feasible when the mathematical form of the nltva s restoring force is carefully chosen , which justifies the proposed synthesis of the absorber s load - deflection curve .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly reviews den hartog s equal - peak method and revisits the dynamics of the classical linear tuned vibration absorber coupled to a duffing oscillator . section 3 lays down the foundations of the nltva by proposing a tuning rule for the absorber s restoring force . the nltva parameters are then determined using a nonlinear generalization of den hartog s equal - peak method . the performance of the absorber is carefully assessed in section 4 using a duffing oscillator as host system .",
    "the conclusions of the present study are summarized in section 5 .",
    "the steady - state response of an undamped mass - spring system subjected to a harmonic excitation at a constant frequency can be suppressed using an undamped linear tuned vibration absorber ( ltva ) , as proposed by frahm in 1909 @xcite .",
    "however , the ltva performance deteriorates significantly when the excitation frequency varies . to improve the performance robustness , damping was introduced in the absorber by ormondroyd and den hartog @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion of the coupled system are @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the displacements of the harmonically - forced primary system and of the damped ltva , respectively .",
    "den hartog realized that the receptance function of the primary mass passes through two invariant points independent of absorber damping .",
    "he proposed to adjust the absorber stiffness to have two fixed points of equal heights in the receptance curve and to select the absorber damping so that the curve presents a horizontal tangent through one of the fixed points .",
    "this laid down the foundations of the so - called equal - peak method .",
    "den hartog @xcite and brock @xcite derived approximate analytic formulas for the absorber stiffness and damping , respectively .",
    "interestingly , an exact closed - form solution for this classical problem was found only ten years ago @xcite : @xmath3 }      { 3(64 + 80\\epsilon+27\\epsilon^2)}}\\\\      \\mu_2&=&\\frac{c_2}{2\\sqrt{k_2m_2}}=\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{\\frac{8 + 9\\epsilon-4\\sqrt{4 + 3\\epsilon}}{1+\\epsilon } }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the natural frequencies of the primary system and of the absorber , respectively , @xmath6 is the mass ratio and @xmath7 is the damping ratio . for @xmath8 kg , @xmath9n / m and @xmath10",

    "( a ) cubic spring ; ( b ) quadratic spring ; ( c ) quintic spring.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( 6.5,0)forcing amplitude ( n ) ( 6.5,7)forcing amplitude ( n ) ( -0.1,1 ) ( 8.25,1.05 ) ( 5.2,12.8)(a ) ( 1.2,5.7)(b ) ( 9.7,5.7)(c )    the amplitude of the limit points of the isola as a function of forcing amplitude is displayed in figure [ companltva_ltva_large ] .",
    "the underlying dynamical mechanism is as follows .",
    "the isola is created by a pair of saddle - node bifurcations close to @xmath106n . for increasing forcing amplitudes ,",
    "the two bifurcations move away from each other , as depicted in figure [ companltva_ltva_large](b ) , until one of them meets the saddle - node bifurcation defining the second resonance peak .",
    "the isola then coalesces with this resonance , which gives rise to a new resonance peak with a much larger amplitude , as represented in figure [ explanationdetuning](b ) for @xmath103n .",
    "the coalescence occurs for @xmath107n ; this forcing amplitude therefore represents an upper limit beyond which the nonlinear equal - peak method is no longer applicable . despite the presence of the isola",
    ", we note that the nltva still remains more effective than the ltva .",
    "furthermore , if the basin of attraction of the isola is relatively small , the absorber can work properly also in coexistence of the isola itself .",
    "going back to figures [ nl_dh](a , b ) , the isola explains why the curves were discontinued , i.e. , why equal peaks could no longer be achieved . from these plots",
    ", we can observe that isolas occur for comparatively larger values of @xmath76 and smaller values of the mass ratio @xmath19 .",
    "isolas are generic for nonlinear vibration absorbers and neutralizers @xcite .",
    "they will be investigated more closely in future studies .",
    "another dynamical instability that exists in the coupled system is a combination resonance leading to quasiperiodic regimes of motions .",
    "it appears because the nltva is designed such that the desired operating frequency is approximately the mean of the two nonlinear resonant frequencies of the system @xcite .",
    "quasiperiodic motion is observed between @xmath108n and @xmath103n , and the corresponding peak amplitudes are represented in figure [ qp ] . for illustration , a quasiperiodic branch computed through direct numerical simulations is depicted in figure [ qp1](a ) for @xmath106n , and a time series is shown in figure [ qp1](b ) .",
    "unlike what was observed in @xcite , the quasiperiodic motions have an amplitude comparable to the amplitude of the resonance peaks .",
    "they do not destroy the effectiveness of the nltva .",
    "we note that , for a nonlinear energy sink , quasiperiodic motions can even be beneficial , because they replace a resonance with motions of much smaller amplitudes @xcite .    to conclude the validation of the nonlinear equal - peak method , the nonlinear coefficient @xmath102 that realizes equal resonance peaks for various forcing amplitudes",
    "is computed using the path - following algorithm .",
    "three different nonlinearities for the nltva , namely @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , are considered .",
    "figure [ othertuningamplitudes2](a ) confirms that the coefficient of the cubic spring does not exhibit variability when the forcing amplitude is increased .",
    "its value is in very close agreement with the closed - form solution ( [ analyticformulas ] ) . for a nltva with a quadratic spring , figure [ othertuningamplitudes2](b )",
    "evidences that the nonlinear coefficient undergoes a strong variation with forcing amplitude , as it was predicted by the discussion in section [ synth ] .",
    "the variation is even more important for a quintic spring in figure [ othertuningamplitudes2](c ) .",
    "our purpose in this study is the development of a nonlinear absorber , the nltva , for mitigating the vibrations of a nonlinear resonance of a mechanical system .",
    "a specific objective is to ensure the effectiveness of the absorber in weakly as well as strongly nonlinear regimes of motion for which the primary system s resonance frequency can undergo substantial variations .    to this end , the additional design parameter offered by nonlinear devices , i.e.",
    ", the mathematical form of the absorber s restoring force , is exploited thereby synthesizing nonlinearity for enhanced performance .",
    "we show that , if the nltva is ` a mirror ' of the primary system , a nonlinear counterpart of den hartog s equal - peak method can be established .",
    "simple , though accurate , analytic formulas are derived for this nonlinear equal - peak method .",
    "they lead to the design of an absorber with excellent performance in a relatively large range of forcing amplitudes .",
    "interestingly , the coupled system duffing - nltva is found to exhibit dynamics that bear resemblance to that of a linear system .    for very strongly nonlinear regimes , inherently nonlinear dynamical instabilities , namely detached resonance curves and quasiperiodic solutions , appear .",
    "despite these instabilities , the performance of the nltva remains always superior to the classical ltva .",
    "further research should study how these instabilities can be mitigated or eliminated .",
    "the extension of the present results to multi - degree - of - freedom primary structures will also be considered .",
    "finally , another promising application of the nltva that deserves further investigation is the suppression of limit cycle oscillations @xcite , which exist , for instance , in aircraft wings and automotive disc brakes .",
