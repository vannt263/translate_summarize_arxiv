    "in these days , interference management is one of the most important issues in wireless communication systems . in order to obtain high spectral efficiency ,",
    "many interference management techniques have been proposed and studied .",
    "for the two - user interference channel , the capacity region is already known for weak and strong interference regions in @xcite and @xcite . for the moderate region ,",
    "the capacity region is still unknown , but there are some works that the capacity regions can be achieved by rate - splitting within one bit @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite also proved that the optimal generalized degrees of freedom are achievable using the rate - splitting scheme .",
    "compared to the two - user interference channel , the general @xmath0-user interference channel have not been much known yet .",
    "many researchers have studied degrees of freedom ( dof ) to understand the asymptotic capacity because of the difficulty of finding the exact capacity region . for the @xmath0-user interference channel ,",
    "the dof was shown to be upper bounded by @xmath2 in @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite showed that this upper bound can be achieved by the interference alignment ( ia ) scheme that all interfering signals from other transmitters are aligned in the same dimension to independently decode the desired signals at the receivers .",
    "this scheme operates in high snr to guarantee independence between the desired signal dimension and the interference aligned dimension . in order to operate in any finite snr",
    ", @xcite proposed ergodic ia that all interfering signals are perfectly cancelled out by properly choosing two time indices . using ergodic ia",
    ", each user can achieve half the interference - free ergodic capacity .",
    "the ia schemes generally require perfect channel state information ( csi ) . in rapidly time varying channels ,",
    "however , channel state information becomes outdated due to feedback delay .",
    "in other words , it is impractical to assume that transmitters have perfect knowledge of current channel state information . in order to solve this problem , recent studies @xcite focus on exploiting imperfect channel state information  no channel state information at transmitter ( csit ) or delayed feedback information .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath3 dof is achievable for the three - user interference channel with delayed csit and @xmath4 dof is achievable for the three - user interference channel with delayed output feedback without csit .",
    "more generally , @xcite showed that @xmath5 dof is achievable for the @xmath0-user interference channel @xmath6 with delayed csit and @xmath7 dof is achievable for the @xmath0-user interference channel with delayed output feedback without csit .    in this paper , we assume two delayed feedback scenarios as follows .",
    "( i ) _ delayed channel information at transmitter _ : in this scenario , nothing but the past channel information is given at the transmitter .",
    "the channel information implies either channel state information or time index information .",
    "output feedback is not assumed in this case .",
    "( ii ) _ delayed output feedback without csit _ : in this scenario , nothing but the past output feedback information is given at the transmitter and the channel information is not available at the transmitter .",
    "we devise effective interference management strategies in the @xmath0-user interference channel for these two scenarios .",
    "the proposed schemes are developed in the framework of ergodic ia @xcite and enables interference - free decoding of the desired message at the receiver .",
    "it is shown that the proposed strategies achieve @xmath8 dof in the @xmath0-user interference channel for the scenarios of the delayed channel information and the delayed output feedback without csit .",
    "the proposed schemes achieve higher dof than the retrospective ia @xcite in the @xmath0 user interference channel with the same assumptions of delayed feedback .",

    "the element of the additive white gaussian noise vector @xmath20^t$ ] is assumed to follow complex gaussian distribution @xmath21 .",
    "the ergodic ia @xcite requires perfect knowledge of channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) . for a @xmath0-user interference channel",
    ", @xmath22 total dof can be achieved in an ergodic sense if the channel is time varying .",
    "contrary to other ia techniques , the ergodic ia works for infinite snr as well as any finite snr since interfering signals are canceled out when the channel matrices at two different time instants satisfy a certain condition .",
    "specifically , let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be the time instants ( or time indices ) at which the the channel matrices satisfy the following relationship : @xmath25\\label{eq : channel1}\\\\                  \\textbf{h}(t_2 ) & = c(t_2)\\cdot\\left [                    \\begin{array}{ccc }                      h_{11}(t_1 ) & \\cdots & -h_{1k}(t_1 ) \\\\",

    "correspondingly , the total @xmath2 dof is achievable @xcite .",
    "contrary to the existing ergodic ia , we assume only full csir and imperfect or partial csit by feedback delay .",
    "specifically , all receivers feed either channel state information or time indices back to the transmitters .",
    "each transmitter can not use the current channel information but can use the outdated channel information due to feedback delay .      in this subsection",
    ", we propose a new strategy to achieve high dof when the receivers feed csi back to the transmitters . to effectively establish the concept of the proposed scheme , we start from the three - user interference channel , i.e. , @xmath39 .    three - user interference channel with delayed csit can achieve total @xmath40 dof by ergodic ia .",
    "the proposed ergodic ia is carried out over two phases :    _ transmission phase 1 _ : transmission phase 1 for data transmission is continued until @xmath24 . at each time until @xmath24 , new messages are continuously transmitted . for the time @xmath23 and @xmath41",
    "at which the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied , the received signals are given by @xmath42 due to delayed csit , the transmitters can not recognize what the current channel states are so that they can not send the same message of @xmath23 at @xmath24 as in the conventional ergodic ia .",
    "thus , they just send independent messages at @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "after the channel changes , the transmitters can figure out that the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied at the previous time @xmath24 due to delayed csi feedback .",

    "that is , total 6 messages are decodable over 5 symbol times and hence total 6/5 dof is achievable .",
    "total @xmath8 dof is achievable in a @xmath0-user interference channel with delayed csit by ergodic ia .    for a @xmath0-user interference channel , two independent messages sent at time @xmath23 and @xmath24",

    "instead of using the channel state information ( i.e. , channel matrix ) to find the time @xmath23 and @xmath24 at which the condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied , the receivers send the time indices @xmath23 and @xmath24 since receivers can find them by the assumption of full csir .",

    "therefore , the transmitters continue to send independent messages at @xmath24 . however , the receivers know that the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied at @xmath24 owing to full csir so that they construct the following output feedback information and send them back to the transmitters after receiving the signals at @xmath24 .",
