    "the @xmath0 scuti - type pulsators are stars with masses between 1.5 and 2.5 @xmath1 located at the intersection of the classical cepheid instability strip with the main sequence .",
    "they have spectral types a and f , a period range between 0.5 h and 6 h , and generally pulsate with a large number of radial and nonradial modes excited by the @xmath2-mechanism associated with the second helium ionization zone .",
    "these oscillation modes penetrate to different depths inside the star .",
    "thus , @xmath0 scuti stars provide a good opportunity to probe the internal structure of intermediate mass stars .",
    "since most of the @xmath0 scuti stars are short period variables with typical photometric amplitude of 20 mmag , their oscillations can be easily detected from the ground .",
    "in fact , several @xmath0 scuti stars have been discovered accidentally when taken as reference stars for observations of well known @xmath0 scuti stars [ e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "however to resolve their rich oscillation spectrum from the ground , high quality long time series are required which can only be obtained by means of observations from different sites distributed in longitude around the earth ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , to characterize the pulsation spectrum of a new @xmath0 scuti star additional observational efforts are needed .",
    "in this paper we present the results of photometric and spectroscopic follow - up observations of , a new @xmath0 scuti star recently discovered in cygnus , aimed at characterizing its pulsation behavior more accurately .",
    "the star ( @xmath3 sao 51294 , bd@xmath442 4207 , hip 107557 ) was discovered to be a new @xmath0 scuti star by @xcite when observing a sample of a - type stars on the night of september 27 , 2007 , in order to test the six - channel @xmath5-@xmath6 spectrophotometer attached to the h.  l. johnson 1.5-m telescope of the san pedro mrtir observatory , baja california , mexico .",
    "the variability of the star was clear , despite the fact that it was observed less than 2 h. six hours of ccd photometric observations on the night of september 30 , 2007 , with the 0.84-m telescope of the same observatory confirmed its variability @xcite .",
    "differential and standard strmgren @xmath7 photometry of was obtained by @xcite using the same equipment as the former observations . in particular ,",
    "the star was monitored for about 11 h between november 11 and november 19 , 2007 . as a result",
    ", @xcite found evidence of at least two close frequencies which might explain the resulting beating behavior of the light curve .",
    "the derived standard photometry is the following : ( @xmath8 , @xmath9@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) = ( 8.329 , 0.125 , 0.150 , 1.018 ) .",
    "@xcite also estimated a stellar reddening from the reddening maps of schlegel et al .",

    "the hipparcos catalogue @xcite , on the other hand , provides a parallax of 3.31 @xmath21 0.88 mas , from which a distance value of 302 @xmath21 81 pc can be estimated .",
    "this corresponds to a distance modulus of 7.40 @xmath21 0.60 mag , which indicates a value of @xmath22 0.6 mag for .",
    "therefore the hipparcos distance is in agreement within 1-@xmath23 error with distance reported by @xcite .",
    "the hipparcos catalogue also lists for a magnitude of @xmath24 of 8.3970 @xmath21 0.0022 mag ( median error ) , @xmath21 0.019 mag ( scatter ) and a @xmath25 of 8.335 @xmath21 0.009 mag ( standard error ) .    concerning the spectral classification of , the sao star catalog j2000 ( sao staff 1966 ; usno , adc 1990 ) lists a0 .",
    "the two observatories involved in the observational campaign are the following : +   -observatorio del teide ( ot , spain ) : the data were collected using the iac 80 telescope ( 0.80-m ) . the images were acquired with camelot , a ccd detector of @xmath26 pixels .",

    "from the differential light curves it can be noted that the beating behavior seen in the short time series of @xcite is present .",
    "this is a common characteristic of the light curves of @xmath0 scuti stars .",
    "the amplitude spectrum shows a concentration of high signal - to - noise peaks between 1828 cycle day@xmath28 .",
    "in particular , the highest amplitude peak is located at 22.49 cd@xmath28 ( 260.19 @xmath29hz ) , and the next significant frequency is located at 20.09 cd@xmath28 ( 232.47 @xmath29hz ) .",
    "@xcite detected a significant frequency peak at @xmath30 21.1 cd@xmath28 ( 244.1 @xmath29hz ) with an amplitude of 6 mmag in strmgren @xmath10 band .",
    "as can be seen in table  [ tab : frec ] , this is well within the period of the modes detected in this campaign , taking into account that the complex window function of those observations does not allow a precise comparison . nonetheless , this peak is most likely a side - lobe of the second frequency @xmath31 detected in our campaign .",

    "we note that since these identifications were computed from just few equilibrium models , they should be considered as preliminary .",
    "moreover , we have neglected the rotational effects in spite the fact that is most likely a high rotating star .",
    "in fact , the rotation effects are important not only in the position of the star in a hr diagram @xcite but also in the computation of oscillation frequencies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these simple computations indicates that may pulsate in radial and non - radial modes typical among @xmath0 scuti stars .",
