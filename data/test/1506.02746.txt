    "prismatic dislocation loops play an important role in influencing the macroscopic mechanical properties of materials , in particular ductility and fracture toughness in metals  @xcite . a large concentration of prismatic loops",
    "have been observed in quenched metals and in materials subject to large doses of radiation .",
    "it is widely believed that vacancy clustering is a precursor mechanism to the nucleation of prismatic loops in quenched metals  @xcite . in irradiated materials ,",
    "experimental studies have shown a direct correlation between the dose of irradiation , the population of prismatic dislocation loops , and the loss of ductility and fracture toughness ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "numerous atomistic simulations have been conducted using empirical interatomic potentials to study the nucleation and evolution of defects in irradiated materials ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these studies revealed displacement cascades nucleating a large concentration of vacancies and self - interstitals , which subsequently result in the formation of prismatic dislocation loops ( vacancy loops and self - interstital clusters ) , among other defects , through the coalescence of vacancies into vacancy clusters and self - interstitials into self - interstitial clusters .",
    "while the displacement cascade simulations have elucidated the overall mechanism of the formation of prismatic loops , they do not provide insights into the energetics of formation of these defects which dictates the nucleation and evolution of these defects .",
    "further , the nucleation of prismatic loops is a very rapid process that is hard to capture experimentally , especially given the high mobility of nanometer - sized prismatic loops  @xcite . to this end",
    ", atomistic calculations have been employed to study the energetics of various sizes of vacancy and self - interstitial clusters ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "while these atomistic studies have provided many important qualitative insights , these efforts have used empirical potentials to model interactions between various atoms in materials .",
    "the results of these simulations are significantly influenced by the choice of empirical potentials used and the physical quantities to which the parameters of these empirical potentials are fitted .",
    "it is hard to ascertain the accuracy of these empirical potentials to describe the details of the defect core , which involves situations with making and breaking of chemical bonds governed by quantum - mechanical interactions .",
    "thus , it is desirable to conduct density functional theory ( dft ) calculations to study the energetics of the formation of these defects .",
    "the most widely used implementations of density functional theory are based on fourier space formulations with a plane - wave discretization .",
    "while these fourier space implementations have provided tremendous insights into the bulk properties of a wide range of materials , they are often restricted to simulation domains containing a few hundred atoms with periodic geometries .",
    "this poses a severe restriction in the electronic structure study of defects which require non - periodic geometries and larger simulation domains to accurately account for both the quantum - mechanical interactions at the defect core as well as the long - ranged elastic fields .    in the present work",
    "we employ a real - space formulation of orbital - free density functional theory and the quasi - continuum reduction technique to conduct electronic structure calculations on multi - million atom systems . in particular , we employ the wang govind carter ( wgc ) orbital - free kinetic energy functional  @xcite which has been shown to be accurate for aluminum for a wide range of properties  @xcite .",
    "we begin our study by computing the binding energies of divacancies in aluminum .",
    "a cell - size study of the binding energy of divacancies has shown significant cell - size dependence up to 2,000 atoms , underscoring the need for large - scale electronic structure calculations to accurately study the energetics of defects in materials .",
    "the computed binding energies of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 divacancies are positive indicating the tendency of vacancies to attract . to understand the energetics of vacancy clustering , we next consider quad - vacancy clusters formed from divacancies .",
    "the computed binding energies of all quad - vacancy clusters considered in this study are positive . among the planar",
    "quad - vacancy clusters , those lying in the \\{111 } plane had the highest binding energy . in order to investigate the energetics of vacancy clusters in the \\{111 } plane , which is also one of the habit planes for vacancy prismatic loops , we consider hexagonal vacancy clusters of various sizes on this plane .",
    "while the 7 vacancy hexagonal cluster has positive binding energy , this is only marginally greater than the quad - vacancy cluster in the \\{111 } plane .",
    "however , the 19 vacancy cluster has a very large relaxed binding energy and the atomic structure closely resembles a collapsed prismatic dislocation loop .",
    "this study suggests that vacancy clusters containing as small as 19 vacancies can collapse to form stable prismatic loops , thus providing insights into the nucleation size of these defects .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] presents a brief overview of the local real - space formulation of orbital - free dft and the quasi continuum reduction technique employed in this work that has enabled consideration of multi - million atom computational domains .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents our electronic structure study of vacancy clustering and nucleation of prismatic dislocation loops , along with a discussion of the new findings and their implications .",
    "we finally conclude with an outlook in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , for the sake of completeness and to keep the discussion self - contained , we provide an overview of the local real - space formulation of orbital - free dft , finite - element discretization , and the coarse - graining technique  quasi - continuum orbital - free dft  employed in this work .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a comprehensive discussion on the local real - space formulation , and  @xcite for details on the coarse - graining technique .",
    "the main ideas are discussed below .",
    "the ground - state energy in orbital - free density functional theory  @xcite is given by @xmath4 where , @xmath5 denotes the square - root of electron - density and @xmath6 denotes the vector collecting the positions of atoms . in equation",
    ", @xmath7 denotes the kinetic energy of non - interacting electrons , which is explicitly modeled in orbital - free dft ; @xmath8 denotes the exchange - correlation energy , which includes all the quantum - mechanical interactions between electrons ; @xmath9 denotes the hartree energy or the classical electrostatic interactions between the electrons ; @xmath10 denotes the classical electrostatic interaction energy between the electrons and nuclei ; and @xmath11 denotes the nuclear - nuclear electrostatic repulsion energy .    the density - dependent wang - govind - carter ( wgc ) kinetic energy functional  @xcite is the most widely used model for @xmath7 in solid - state orbital - free dft calculations on materials systems whose electronic structure is close to a free - electron gas , and is employed in this work .",
    "numerical studies have indicated that this is a transferable model for al , mg and al - mg materials systems with accuracies commensurate with kohn - sham dft calculations on a wide range of materials properties  @xcite .",
    "the functional form of the wgc kinetic energy functional is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 in the above equation , the first term is the thomas - fermi energy with @xmath14 , the second term is the von - weizs@xmath15cker correction  @xcite , and the last term , @xmath16 , denotes the density - dependent kernel kinetic energy functional .",
    "the kernel @xmath17 and parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 are chosen such that the linear response of uniform electron gas matches the theoretically known lindhard response  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the wgc functional , these parameters are chosen to be @xmath20 , and the density - dependent kernel is expanded as a taylor series about the bulk average electron density , resulting in a series of density independent kernels  @xcite .",
    "widely used models for the exchange - correlation energy , especially for solid - state calculations of ground - state properties , include the local density approximation ( lda ) and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) , and have been demonstrated to be transferable models for a range of materials systems and materials properties . in the present work , we will employ the lda exchange - correlation functional given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the exchange and correlation energy per electron given by @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the values of constants used in this study are those of an unpolarized medium , and are given by @xmath26 = -0.1471 , @xmath27 = 1.1581 , @xmath28 = 0.3446 , @xmath29 = 0.0311 , @xmath30 = -0.048 , @xmath31 = 0.0014 , @xmath32 = -0.0108 .",
    "the remaining terms in equation   constitute the classical electrostatic energy between electrons and the nuclei , and are given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the valence charge and pseudopotential corresponding to atom @xmath36 located at @xmath37 , respectively",
    ".    in the energy functional  , all the terms are local , excepting the extended interactions in electrostatic energy and the kernel energy .",
    "a local variational reformulation of these extended interactions in real - space has been developed in prior works  @xcite , which has enabled the consideration of general boundary conditions for studies on energetics of isolated defects  @xcite and is also a crucial step in developing coarse - graining schemes for electronic structure calculations .",
    "the extended interactions in electrostatics are governed by the @xmath38 kernel , which is the green s function of the laplace operator .",
    "thus , the total electrostatic interaction energy can be reformulated as the following local variational problem : @xmath39 in the above , @xmath40 denotes the nuclear charge distribution corresponding to the ionic pseudopotential of the @xmath41 nucleus , @xmath42 denotes the electrostatic potential corresponding to the total charge distribution comprising of the electrons and the nuclei , and @xmath43 is an appropriate function space .",
    "@xmath44 denotes the self energy of the nuclear charge distributions which is computed by taking recourse to the poisson equation associated with nuclear charge distribution ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed an approach to develop a local real - space formulation for the extended interactions in the kernel kinetic energy functional .",
    "in particular , they demonstrated that the series of density independent kernels obtained from the taylor series expansion of the wgc density dependent kernel can each be approximated in the fourier - space using a sum of partial fractions . using this approximation ,",
    "the extended interactions in the kernel kinetic energy functional can be reformulated in terms of the solutions of a series of helmholtz equations . if @xmath45 denotes a density independent kernel , and is approximated in the fourier - space using the approximation @xmath46 , the kernel energy corresponding to the density independent kernel can be expressed as the following variational problem  @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48d\\br\\bigr\\}\\ , . \\ ] ] in the above , @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the vector of potential fields , and @xmath51 denotes a suitable function space .",
    "we refer by ` kernel potentials ' the auxiliary potential fields , @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 , introduced in the local reformulation of the extended interactions in the kernel energy .",
    "the problem of computing the ground - state energy and ground - state electronic structure of an @xmath55 electron system in orbital - free dft for a fixed position of atoms can be expressed as a local variational problem in real - space using the reformulations in equations   and  , and is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the lagrangian resulting from the local reformulations in equations   and  . the function spaces , @xmath58 , @xmath43 and @xmath51 are appropriately chosen based on the boundary conditions dictated by the problem .",
    "the well - posedness of this local variational saddle - point orbital - free dft problem has been established using the direct method in calculus of variations for certain models of orbital - free dft kinetic energy functionals , and we refer to  @xcite for further details on the mathematical properties of the formulation .      a finite - element basis presents a natural basis set to discretize the local real - space variational formulation of orbital - free dft discussed in section  [ sec : rs - ofdft ] , and is employed in this work .",
    "the finite - element discretization of the orbital - free dft problem presents many advantages over the widely used plane - wave discretization of orbital - free dft calculations  @xcite .",
    "it allows for the consideration of complex geometries and boundary conditions that are not accessible through fourier - space formulations of orbital - free dft employing plane - wave discretization .",
    "this freedom from periodic boundary conditions is significant in the study of the energetics of defects in materials , which often break periodicity of perfect materials . to elucidate , the geometry of an isolated dislocation is not compatible with periodic boundary conditions which has limited our capabilities in studying the energetics of such defects .",
    "the recent developments in real - space formulation of orbital - free dft and the finite - element discretization have enabled some of the first studies on the energetics of an isolated edge dislocation in aluminum , providing key insights into the size of a dislocation - core or core - energetics from electronic structure calculations  @xcite . while fourier space implementations are computationally more efficient than real - space implementations using finite - element basis , recent numerical efforts which use higher - order finite - element discretizations  @xcite",
    "have been shown to bridge this gap .",
    "further , the good scalability of the finite - element discretization on parallel computing platforms allows the use of high performance computing resources to consider complex problems that are not accessible otherwise . finally , the finite - element discretization is amenable to unstructured coarse - graining , which is the main idea exploited in the quasi - continuum coarse - graining technique , discussed subsequently , which has enabled electronic structure calculations at macroscopic scales using orbital - free dft .      in this section",
    ", we present the key ideas in quasi - continuum orbital - free dft ( qc - ofdft)a seamless coarse - graining approach that enables us to perform multi - million atom orbital - free dft simulations for electronic structure studies on defects at physically realistic concentrations .",
    "qc - ofdft uses orbital - free dft as the sole input physics and exploits the local real - space formulation in conjunction with the basis set adaptivity of the finite - element basis to achieve orbital - free dft electronic structure calculations at macroscopic scales .",
    "the quasi - continuum reduction technique for orbital - free dft was first demonstrated for local kinetic energy functionals  @xcite and later extended to the non - local wgc kinetic energy functionals employed in this work  @xcite .",
    "the idea of quasi - continuum reduction was originally proposed in the context of interatomic potentials as a seamless scheme bridging the atomistic and continuum length - scales for crystalline materials  @xcite in order to simultaneously account for the atomistic interactions at the defect - core as well as the long - ranged elastic fields accompanying the defect .",
    "the quasi - continuum reduction idea is based on kinematic constraints introduced of the positions of atoms , thus reducing the number of degrees of freedom in the variational problem of computing the ground - state of a materials system .",
    "the kinematic constraints are introduced via a finite - element triangulation of a subset of atoms in the computational domain , which are referred to as the representative atoms or _",
    "rep atoms_. the _ rep atoms _ are chosen such that full atomistic resolution is provided in regions of interest , such as the defect - core with large atomistic displacements , and coarse - graining elsewhere .",
    "the kinematic constraints on atomistic displacements introduced through the finite - element triangulation of the _ rep atoms _ provides an excellent subspace for solving the variational problem of computing the ground - state energy of crystalline materials systems with defects .",
    "the quasi - continuum reduction for electronic structure calculations presents an additional challenge of coarse - graining the electronic fields that exhibit oscillations on a subatomic length - scale . in qc - ofdft formalism",
    ", the atomic displacements are treated in a similar manner as the quasi - continuum approach for interatomic potentials where kinematic constraints are introduced on atomistic displacements using a finite - element triangulation of _ rep atoms_. the electronic fields comprising of the square - root electron - density , electrostatic potential , and kernel potentials are decomposed into predictor and corrector fields : @xmath59 where ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) denote the predictor electronic - fields that are computed using periodic unit - cell calculations undergoing the cauchy - born deformation of the underlying lattice .",
    "the predictor fields provide a good representation of the electronic fields to the leading order in regions of smooth deformations  @xcite , such as regions away from the defect - core that are governed by elastic interactions .",
    "however , the electronic structure deviates significantly from that of the predictor fields in regions of rapidly varying deformations , such as in the defect - core .",
    "these deviations are captured through the corrector fields ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) , and are computed from the local variational saddle - point problem discussed in section  [ sec : rs - ofdft ] .",
    "as the predictor fields are a good representation of the electronic fields away from the defect - core , the corrector fields are significant only near the defect - core .",
    "thus , the corrector fields can be effectively represented by a finite - element triangulation which has sufficient resolution near the defect - core , but coarse - grains far away .",
    "the numerical implementation of the qc - ofdft method is conducted using a hierarchy of finite - element triangulations ( cf .",

    "often , for the sake of convenience , the electronic - mesh is chosen to be a subgrid of the atomic mesh . using the decomposition in equation",

    "the effectiveness of qc - ofdft has made possible electronic structure calculations at macroscopic scales using orbital - free dft for studying the energetics of defects at realistic concentrations .",
    "further , this provides a seamless scheme to account for both the quantum - mechanical effects at the defect - core and the long - ranged elastic fields using an electronic structure theory ( orbital - free dft ) as the sole input physics .",
    "prior investigations have used qc - ofdft to study the energetics of vacancies and dislocations in aluminum , and have provided important physical insights  @xcite .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for numerical and mathematical analysis of the quasi - continuum reduction of orbital - free dft , and field theories , in general .",
    "we now present the results of our study on the energetics of vacancy clustering in aluminum and nucleation of vacancy prismatic dislocation loops using large - scale orbital - free dft electronic structure calculations . in this study",
    ", we employ the wang - govind - carter ( wgc ) kinetic energy functional  @xcite with first - order taylor expansion of the density dependent kernel ( cf .",

    "in all the simulations reported in this work , we employ homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions on the corrector electronic fields , which correspond to the perturbations in the electronic fields arising from the defect vanishing on the boundary of the simulation domain with the electronic structure beyond the computational domain corresponding to that of the bulk .",

    "we hold the positions of atoms fixed on the boundary of the simulation cell , while relaxing the positions of the interior atoms .      in order to understand cell - size effects and establish the simulation domain sizes needed to accurately understand the energetics of vacancy interactions , we first conduct a cell - size study on divacancy binding energies in aluminum .",

    "in particular , this study indicates that cell - sizes containing about @xmath82 nominal number of atoms are required to obtain convergence in the binding energies of these simple defects .",

    "having established the stability of divacancies , we next proceed to further investigate the vacancy clustering mechanism by computing the binding energies of quad - vacancy clusters formed from divacancies . as the number of possible quad - vacancy clusters is very large ,",

    "the slip along @xmath90 eliminates the stacking fault , thus resulting in an unfaulted dislocation loop .",
    "the slip observed in the 19-vacancy loop is not sufficient to completely remove the stacking fault , but shows the tendency of the prismatic loop to unfault and we expect to observe complete unfaulting for larger - sized vacancy clusters .",

    "investigations on hexagonal vacancy clusters of varying sizes showed positive binding energies .",
    "however , the 19-vacancy hexagonal vacancy cluster had significantly higher binding energy compared to the 7-vacancy hexagonal cluster .",
    "an analysis of the relaxed atomic positions of the 19-vacancy cluster revealed a collapsed vacancy prismatic dislocation loop .",
    "this study suggests that vacancy prismatic loops formed from vacancy clusters as small as 19 vacancies are stable and suggests that the nucleation sizes of these defects can be much smaller than the stable loops observed in experimental investigations that are often @xmath87   or larger in diameter .",
    "while this study has shown that vacancy clustering is an energetically feasible mechanism that can result in the nucleation of vacancy prismatic loops , many outstanding questions remain and are worthwhile topics for future investigations .",
    "an interesting and important question is relative stability of non - planar vacancy clusters of various sizes in comparison to planar vacancy clusters , which has important bearing on the formation of stacking fault tetrahedra .",
    "another key question relates to the interaction of these defects with dislocations that influences the macroscopic mechanical properties of materials .",

    "<S> in the present work , we conduct large - scale orbital - free dft calculations to study the energetics of vacancy clustering in aluminum from electronic structure calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation domains considered in this study are as large as those containing a million atoms to accurately account for both the electronic structure and long - ranged elastic fields . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that vacancy clustering is an energetically favorable mechanisms with positive binding energies for a range of vacancy clusters considered in the present study . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the @xmath0 vacancy hexagonal cluster lying in @xmath1 plane has a very large binding energy with the relaxed atomic structure representative of a prismatic dislocation loop . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that vacancy prismatic loops as small as those formed from 19 vacancies are stable , thus providing insights into the nucleation sizes of these defects in aluminum .    </S>",
