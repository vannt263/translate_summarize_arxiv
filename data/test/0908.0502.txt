    "one of the most important constraints on supersymmetric models comes from considerations of the mass of the lightest neutral higgs , @xmath0 . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    ", the mass of the @xmath0 field at tree level @xcite must be less than the @xmath5 mass , but radiative corrections ( primarily due to top quark / squark loops ) can lift this to @xmath6 gev @xcite . while non - minimal supersymmetric models can evade this bound somewhat , it is very difficult @xcite to raise the upper bound by more than a few tens of gev .",
    "another constraint comes from the mass of the charged higgs boson , @xmath1 . at tree level",
    ", one has @xcite",
    "@xmath7 where @xmath3 is the pseudoscalar higgs mass .",
    "thus , the charged higgs mass can not be much heavier than the pseudoscalar , and the decay @xmath4 is kinematically forbidden@xcite .",
    "similar considerations involving the mass of the heavier neutral scalar , @xmath2 , show that at tree level @xmath8 which also shows that the charged higgs can not decay into @xmath9 .",
    "radiative corrections to these formulae have been calculated @xcite and , as in the neutral case , are typically tens of gev .    in this brief report",
    ", we note that one of the simplest extensions of the mssm substantially changes these bounds ; the addition of a sequential fourth generation .",
    "interest in a fourth chiral generation ( with a sufficiently heavy neutrino to avoid contributing to the z width ) has fluctuated over the years @xcite . in the early part of this decade",
    ", it was believed by many that electroweak radiative corrections ruled out a chiral fourth generation @xcite . however , this belief was based on the assumption that the quark masses were degenerate .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that relaxing this assumption allows a fourth generation , and for a mass splitting of @xmath10 , the s and t corrections fit inside the one - sigma error ellipse @xcite .    since corrections to the above mass relations vary as the fourth power of the top quark mass , it is clear that they could be substantially enhanced by a fourth generation .",
    "since the mass splitting between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks is much smaller than their masses , we will assume that they are degenerate in our analysis .",
    "we will consider masses between @xmath13 and @xmath14 gev . the lower bound is somewhat lower than current tevatron limits @xcite , since it might be possible to weaken these limits if supersymmetric decay modes are allowed .",
    "the upper bound comes from the requirement that perturbation theory be valid .",
    "generically , the requirement that the yukawa couplings , @xmath15 in the mssm satisfy the condition @xmath16 implies @xcite that @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the ratio of vacuum expectation values , @xmath20 is the fermion mass , and @xmath21 gev .",
    "this window of @xmath19 closes for masses greater than @xmath22 gev . since the yukawa coupling increases with scale , and we want the model to be valid up to at least a tev , we will set the upper bound to @xmath14 gev .    in the next section ,",
    "we look at the lightest neutral scalar , and then consider the mass relations involving the charged higgs scalar in section iii .",
    "section iv contains our conclusions .",
    "as noted above , @xmath19 must be fairly close to one in order for perturbation theory be valid . in this case , the tree level value of the lightest neutral higgs mass is negligible , and the entire mass must come from radiative corrections . in the three generation case ,",
    "these corrections have been calculated , first in ref .",
    "@xcite , and then with increasing precision by many others @xcite .",
    "generally , the contributions from radiative corrections will not be sufficient to increase the mass above @xmath23 gev ( if the tree level mass is negligible ) .    in the case of four generations ,",
    "this is not the case .",
    "some early works exploring four generation supersymmetry models@xcite did not really address the possibility of fourth generation quarks above 300 gev . more recently , an exploration of the electroweak phase transition in the four generation mssm appeared@xcite , but it used a value of @xmath24 which put the @xmath11 yukawa coupling far outside the region of perturbative validity .",
    "last year , murdock , et al.@xcite discussed ways of extending the validity of perturbation theory in the four generation mssm .",
    "the only recent discussion of the lightest higgs mass in the four generation mssm was the work of fok and kribs @xcite , who plotted the lightest higgs mass as a function of the heavy quark mass .",
    "they did restrict the model to the case in which the scalar @xmath12 and @xmath11 masses were within twenty percent of the @xmath12 and @xmath11 masses , since that was necessary to obtain sufficient electroweak baryogenesis .    the expression used by fok and kribs @xcite in the limit",
    "in which mixing between scalar quarks is ignored , all squarks have the same mass , the heavier higgs bosons are all very heavy and @xmath25 is @xmath26 where @xmath21 gev . a complete expression which includes two - loop leading logs , as well as squark mixing ,",
    "can be found in the review article of carena and haber @xcite .",
    "we have used that complete expression , and have plotted the results in figure 1 for various values of the susy scale .",
    "the squark masses are presumed to be equal and with a value of @xmath27 the solid ( dashed ) lines are for a pseudoscalar mass of @xmath28 ( @xmath22 ) gev , and the curves , from the lower curve up , correspond to @xmath29 gev , respectively ]    in the graph shown , we have taken the mass of the pseudoscalar to be either @xmath22 or @xmath28 gev , and have fixed @xmath25 .",
    "the results are very insensitive to squark mixing and the precise values of @xmath19 and @xmath30 .",
    "however , they are sensitive to the pseudoscalar mass . for a pseudoscalar mass of several tev",
    ", the results agree with that given in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , but for pseudoscalar masses of @xmath28 ( @xmath22 ) gev , the results ( for @xmath31 gev ) are smaller than that of eq . ( 3 ) by @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) percent .",
    "we see that a large mass for the lightest higgs boson in the four generation mssm not only possible , but is likely for susy scales above several hundred gev .",
    "even a mass of close to @xmath14 gev can not be excluded .",
    "as was noted earlier , eq .",
    "( 1 ) prevents the decay @xmath34 at tree level .",
    "this makes detection of the charged higgs quite difficult , since the @xmath35 decay has very large backgrounds .",
    "radiative corrections to eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and when these are modified to account for a fourth generation , the decay may no longer be kinematically forbidden .",
    "one obtains an expression@xcite for @xmath36 which depends primarily on @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath19 dependence is very small due to the above requirement of the validity of perturbation theory .",
    "the dependence on @xmath37 is illustrated in figure 2 for several values of @xmath38 and @xmath19 fixed to 1 .",
    "we see that the @xmath34 decay becomes kinematically allowed for much of parameter space .",
    "the squark masses are presumed to be equal and with a value of @xmath27 the curves , from the lower curve up , correspond to @xmath29 gev , respectively .",
    "@xmath39 is the average of the charged scalar and pseudoscalar masses . ]",
    "the situation is different with respect to the decay @xmath40 .",
    "radiative corrections to eq .",
    "( 2 ) are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and these can easily be generalized to a fourth generation .",
    "we find that @xmath41 is never less than @xmath42 , and in fact usually @xmath43 by tens of gev .",
    "therefore this decay process is still forbidden , even with higher order corrections .",
    "in addition to the possibility of the decay process @xmath44 , one has the conventional processes @xmath45 and , for sufficiently heavy charged higgs bosons , @xmath46 furthermore , one can also have @xmath47 .",
    "the latter decay will be small in this case .",
    "the reason is that in the limit of @xmath48 gev , one has@xcite @xmath49 , and thus the coupling of the light higgs to the charged higgs and a @xmath50 , which is proportional to @xmath51 , vanishes as @xmath52 .",
    "of course , one might also have various supersymmetric decay modes .",
    "we will only consider decays into @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    , @xmath35 and @xmath46 versus @xmath37 , choosing @xmath56 gev and @xmath57 gev . ]    in figure 3 , we plot the branching ratios of @xmath4 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 versus @xmath37 , choosing @xmath56 gev and @xmath60 gev . note that if the pseudoscalar mass is @xmath28 gev , then one can see from figure 2 that @xmath4 is only allowed for very large values of @xmath37 , and the branching ratio for this mode is always less than a percent .",
    "for @xmath61 gev , the @xmath59 decay rapidly becomes kinematically inaccessible , and the branching ratio for @xmath4 can be as large as @xmath62 .",
    "note that in this case , the pseudoscalar will primarily decay into @xmath63 , and observation of the associated @xmath50 may be the only way to detect it@xcite .",
    "in the mssm , the higgs sector is very tightly restricted .",
    "there is an upper bound of approximately @xmath64 gev on the lightest higgs mass and the charged higgs mass can not differ by more than tens of gev from the pseudoscalar and heavier neutral higgs masses , thus ruling out two - body decays into these states . in this brief report , motivated by recent interest in four generation models ,",
    "we have considered the effects of radiative correction in the four generation mssm .",
    "the upper bound on the lightest higgs mass is substantially increased , and can be as large as @xmath14 gev for reasonable parameter values .",
    "the mass splitting between the charged higgs and pseudoscalar is increased to the point where the @xmath44 decay is kinematically allowed , whereas the splitting between the charged higgs and heavy neutral scalar remains small .",
    "should a fourth generation exist , it will likely be discovered shortly at the lhc .",
    "our main point is that radiative corrections from these quarks can have major implications for the higgs sector , not only for the mssm , but other extensions of the standard model .",
    "we are grateful to chris carone , david reiss and graham c. kribs for useful discussions .",
