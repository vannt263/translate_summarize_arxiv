    "since the discovery of the far - infrared background ( firb ; @xcite ) , successive surveys have aimed to identify the discrete sources ( primarily galaxies ) responsible for this emission . with the launch of the esa _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite , with its large ( 3.5 m ) telescope and high sensitivity , it is now possible to resolve a much greater fraction of the firb .",
    "an essential element of this is to have methods for identifying individual sources from _ herschel _ data .",
    "this paper describes the generation of single - band point source catalogues from scan - map observations at 250 , 350 and 500@xmath0 m made using the photometer array of the spire instrument on _ herschel_. the spire instrument , its in - orbit performance , and its scientific capabilities are described by @xcite , and the spire astronomical calibration methods and accuracy are outlined by @xcite .",
    "the observations described here have been taken as part of the _ herschel _ multi - tiered extragalactic survey ( hermes ; oliver et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , using data from the science demonstration phase ( sdp ) of the survey .",
    "these observations cover approximately 20deg@xmath1 in five regions located in four extra - galactic fields , chosen for their minimal galactic emission at far - infrared wavelengths , and for the amount of high - quality multi - wavelength ancillary data available in those fields ( oliver et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "details of the observations are given in table [ tbl : wcs ] .",
    "the observations in the spitzer first look survey ( fls ) field were taken in spire ",
    "pacs parallel mode , at scan speed 20 arcsec per second , while the other observations were taken in spire - only mode , at scan speed 30 arcsec per second ( abell 2218 , goods - north and lockman - north ) or 60 arcsec per second ( lockman - swire ) .",
    "standard spire observing modes were used for all observations .",
    "the number of repetitions is indicated in table [ tbl : wcs ] ; for each spire - only repetition , the field is scanned in both the nominal and orthogonal directions , while for spire ",
    "pacs parallel mode ( fls ) , one of the repetitions is in the nominal direction and the other is in the orthogonal direction . for the lockman - swire field , two separate observations were taken , offset from one another , in order to produce a more uniform coverage .",
    "the abell 2218 ( a2218 ) data were obtained through two observations , each consisting of 50 repetitions , separated by 38 days , giving complementary scan directions .",
    "all observations were taken with nominal bias mode .",
    "more details are given by @xcite ( @xcite ; in preparation ) ."
