    "a decade after its discovery ( makino et al . 1989 ) , the nature of the compact object in the x - ray binary  has finally been established .",
    "monitoring observations with the wide field cameras ( wfcs ) on _ bepposax _ revealed the source to be a regular source of type i x - ray bursts which are explained as thermonuclear runaway processes on the hard surface of a neutron star ( ubertini et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "previously , the nature was under debate because the x - ray emission exhibited characteristics that were until recently suspected to be solely due to black hole candidates ( tanaka 1989 ) .    an optical counterpart has been identified ( motch et al . 1994 , barret et al . 1995 ) which classifies the binary as a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "later this counterpart was found to exhibit optical bursts and a modulation which is likely to have a periodicity of 2.1  h ( homer et al .",
    "if the latter is interpreted to be of orbital origin , it would imply a binary that is compact among lmxbs",
    ".    appears unusual among lmxbs .",
    "first , x - ray flux measurements after its 1989 discovery are fairly constant ( in  t  zand 1992 , barret et al . 1995 ) at a level of approximately @xmath3  in 2 to 10 kev .",
    "second , the wfc measurements reveal a strong regularity in the occurrence of type i x - ray bursts for an unusually long time ( ubertini et al .",
    "these two facts are very probably related .",
    "the constant flux is indicative of a stable accretion of matter on the neutron star which fuels regularly ignited thermonuclear explosions that give rise to x - ray bursts .",
    "has a hard spectrum , the initial _ ginga _ observations measured a power law spectrum with a photon index of 1.8 ( tanaka 1989 ) .",
    "this makes it particularly important to study the spectrum in a broad photon energy range .",
    "strickman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have attempted this by combining the early _ ginga _ 1 - 40 kev data with 60 - 300 kev osse data taken in 1994 .",
    "del sordo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have performed a preliminary study of the 0.1 - 100 kev data taken with the narrow - field instruments ( nfi ) on board _ bepposax _ in october 1997 . in the present paper ,",
    "we study data taken with the same instrumentation half a year before that .",
    "the primary purpose of this study is to accurately analyze the flux of the persistent emission as well as that of two x - ray bursts .",
    "also , we study the variability of the 2 to 10 kev emission .",
    "the nfi include the low - energy and the medium - energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs and mecs , see parmar et al .",
    "1997 and boella et al .",
    "1997 respectively ) with effective bandpasses of 0.1 - 10 and 1.8 - 10  kev , respectively .",
    "both are imaging instruments .",
    "the mecs was used in the complete configuration of three units ( unit 1 failed one month after the present observation ) .",
    "the other two nfi are the phoswich detector system ( pds ; active between @xmath4 and 300 kev ; frontera et al .",
    "1997 ) and the high - pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hp - gspc ; active between 4 and 120 kev ; manzo et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "a target - of - opportunity observation ( too ) was performed with the nfi between april 6.7 and 7.2 , 1997 ut ( i.e. , 40.8  ks time span ) .",
    "the trigger for the too was the first recognition that the source was bursting ( ubertini et al .",
    "the net exposure times are 8.2  ks for lecs , 23.1  ks for mecs , 18.0  ks for hp - gspc and 20.5  ks for pds .",
    "was strongly detected in all instruments and two @xmath5150  s long x - ray bursts were observed .",
    "we applied extraction radii of 8   and 4  for photons from lecs and mecs images , encircling at least @xmath6% of the power of the instrumental point spread function , to obtain lightcurves and spectra .",
    "long archival exposures on empty sky fields were used to define the background in the same extraction regions .",
    "these are standard data sets made available especially for the purpose of background determination .",
    "all spectra are rebinned so as to sample the spectral full - width at half - maximum resolution by three bins and to accumulate at least 20 photons per bin .",
    "the latter will ensure the applicability of @xmath7 fitting procedures .",
    "a systematic error of 1% is added to each channel of the rebinned lecs and mecs spectra , to account for residual systematic uncertainties in the detector calibrations ( e.g. , guainazzi et al .",
    "1998 ) . for spectral analyses ,",
    "the bandpasses were limited to 0.14.0 kev ( lecs ) , 2.210.5  kev ( mecs ) , 4.030.0 kev ( hp - gspc ) and 15200 kev ( pds ) to avoid photon energies where the spectral calibration of the instruments is not yet complete . in spectral modeling , an allowance was made to leave free the relative normalization of the spectra from lecs , pds and hp - gspc to that of the mecs spectrum , to accommodate cross - calibration uncertainties in this respect .",
    "use was made of the publicly available response matrices ( version september 1997 ) .",
    "fig .  [ figpersistentlc ] shows the lightcurve of the persistent emission of  in various bandpasses . on time scales of a few hundred seconds",
    ", the flux appears constant except for immediately after the occurrence of the two bursts .",
    "we searched for a modulation on time scales of about 2.1  h in the mecs data ( which are the most sensitive ) and find none .",
    "the @xmath8 upper limit on the semi amplitude is 1.6% .",
    "thus , we can not , in x - rays , confirm the optical modulation which had a semi amplitude of 6% .",
    "the power spectrum of the same data ( excluding the burst intervals ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ figpower ] .",
    "a broken power law function was fitted to these data .",
    "the poisson level , which is a free parameter , has been subtracted in fig .",
    "[ figpower ] .",
    "formally , the fit is unacceptable ( @xmath9 for 72 dof ) .",
    "this may be due to narrow features at 0.2 - 0.3  hz and 1 - 2  hz but the statistical quality of the data do not allow a detailed study of those .",
    "the break frequency of the broken power law is @xmath10  hz , the power law index is @xmath11 below and @xmath12 above the break frequency .",
    "the high - frequency index is consistent with the index found from _ ginga _",
    "data taken in 1988 between 0.1 and 500  hz ( tanaka 1989 ) .",
    "the integrated rms power of the noise between 0.002 and 10  hz is @xmath13% , that for the _ ginga _ data between 0.02 and 500 hz is @xmath14% ( barret et al .",
    "if one assumes the same break frequency for the _ ginga _ data , we expect an rms of 17% for these between 0.002 and 10  hz which is very similar to the mecs result .",
    "the break frequency is comparable with values found for lmxb atoll sources and is one order of magnitude below values found for the bright lmxb z sources ( see wijnands & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "we are unable to assess the history or variability of the low - frequency index or break frequency .",
    ".parameter values of two spectral models fitted to the persistent emission .",
    "the errors are single parameter @xmath15 errors . [ cols= \" <",
    ", < \" , ]     @xmath16 - 5/0  s for the second burst [ tabburstfit ]    the photon count rate of the black body radiation in the pds should be negligible above 30 kev ( i.e. , it is about @xmath17 in 30 - 60 kev times that in 12 to 30 kev , for a black body with @xmath18  kev ) .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figburstlc2 ] , there is substantial burst emission between 30 and 60  kev . in fact , the average 30 - 60  kev photon count rate of the burst in the first 11  s after the burst peak is of order half times that in 12 - 30  kev .",
    "this suggests that the burst emission may be comptonized like the persistent emission , although we are not able to verify that spectrally due to insufficient statistics .",
    "the thermal nature of the burst spectra with few kev temperatures and cooling are typical for a type i x - ray burst ( e.g. , lewin et al . 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "such a burst is thought to be due to a thermonuclear ignition of helium accumulated on the surface of a neutron star .",
    "the unabsorbed bolometric peak flux of the black body radiation is estimated at @xmath19  .",
    "this translates into a peak luminosity of @xmath20  .",
    "since we do not find evidence for photospheric expansion in the bursts it is indicated that the burst peak luminosity is below the eddington limit which is @xmath21  for a 1.4  m@xmath22 neutron star .",
    "therefore , we expect the distance to be smaller than @xmath23  kpc or @xmath24  kpc .",
    "barret et al .",
    "( 1995 ) infer from the photometry of the optical counterpart that the lower limit to the distance is 4  kpc",
    ". the relatively low galactic latitude of the source ( @xmath25 ) does not provide better constraints on the distance . for a distance between 4 to 8  kpc",
    ", the x - ray luminosity is between @xmath1 and @xmath2  which are fairly typical values for lmxb x - ray bursters .",
    "the two bursts presented here show traces of comptonization , like in x  160852 ( nakamura et al .",
    "1989 ) , 1e1724308 in terzan 2 ( guainazzi et al .",
    "1998 ) and sax  j1748.92021 in ngc  6440 ( in t zand et al .",
    "the pds time profiles suggest that the level of comptonization matches the burst quite closely . the time delay is less than a few seconds which suggests that the comptonizing cloud is within @xmath26  cm .",
    "unfortunately , this is not a strong constraint because a 2  h binary orbit implies a system size perhaps one order of magnitude smaller than that .",
    "many parameters of the two bursts are equal within narrow error margins : the durations within @xmath27% , the peak temperatures within @xmath28% , the peak emission areas within @xmath29% , and the bolometric fluences within @xmath30% .",
    "this suggests that the physical circumstances for triggering the bursts ( i.e. , the neutron star surface temperature and the composition of accreted matter ) are the same on the two occasions and , together with the prolonged regular bursting and constant persistent flux as measured with wfc , testifies to a rather strong stability of the accretion process .",
    "this suggests a stable accretion disk . in",
    "how far this is uncommon among low - luminosity lmxbs remains to be seen .",
    "the knowledge about such lmxbs is as yet incomplete .",
    "the broad - band spectral measurements of the persistent as well as burst emission enable a fairly accurate determination of @xmath31 which is defined as the bolometric fluence of the persistent emission between two bursts and that of the latter burst .",
    "the time between the two bursts is 23,007  s. we are confident that no bursts were missed during the data gaps because this time is consistent with the quasi - periodicity of the burst recurrence as found from near - simultaneous wfc observations with period 5.8  hr and full - width at half maximum of 0.4  hrs ( ubertini et al .",
    "1999 ) . of all 70 wfc - detected bursts from ,",
    "no two were closer to each other than 19,238  s. the fluence of the second burst is @xmath32  erg  @xmath33 .",
    "the constant persistent emission implies a bolometric fluence between the two bursts of @xmath34  erg  @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 .",
    "this confirms the value found from the wfc analysis ( @xmath36 , ubertini et al ."
