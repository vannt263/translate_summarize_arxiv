    "a pg filter was inserted on the scattered beam before the neutron - spin flipper and the monitor was put on the incoming beam between monochromator and sample . a set of helmholtz coils was used to produce the guide field and the sample was zero field cooled ( less than 2  g ) in an orange - type cryostat . a mounting of 3 crystals with a total mass of 2.5  g containing 1  % ti ( 1ti )",

    "while phonons always contribute to the nsf channel there is an additional selection rule for magnetic scattering .",
    "the magnetic component parallel to the direction of the neutron polarization contributes to the nsf channel , while the components perpendicular to the neutron polarization generate sf scattering . by combining this polarization rule with the geometry factor one can distinguish the different magnetic components . in the geometry we use for the polarized neutron scattering experiment",
    "we see the @xmath16 polarized modes in the sfy channel and they do not loose intensity due to the geometry factor , because the scattering vector is always parallel to the @xmath25 plane and thus perpendicular to @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast the sfz channel contains the in - plane modes , the transverse and longitudinal ones , but weighted with the geometry factor .",
    "for example at @xmath28 the geometry factor for the transverse mode is sin@xmath29 and that for the longitudinal mode sin@xmath30 . at @xmath31",

    "thus , it is possible to distinguish between transverse modes and longitudinal modes by comparing scattering at properly chosen * q*. because the polarization of the neutron beam is not perfect , one has to correct the intensities for the finite flipping - ratio ( fr ) @xcite .",

    "the absolute values of the resistivity curves have a large uncertainty because of the first - order structural phase transition .",
    "there the crystals tend to crack , which prohibits the current to flow through the hole sample .",
    "this effect has been frequently observed during a single measurement cycle .",
    "the resistivity is enhanced by a multiplication factor after passing the structural transition . as the samples have already passed this transition after the crystal growth",
    ", there are some cracks inside the sample , which is evident from measuring several pieces of the same crystal without obtaining the same room - temperature specific resistivity .",
    "the magnetic and insulating properties in ca@xmath2sr@xmath3ruo@xmath1 are closely related to the crystal structure .",

    "ruthenates the distortions can be described as octahedron rotation around the @xmath16  direction and tilting around an in - plane axis .",
    "these distortions and the associated structural phase transitions result from bond - length mismatch , and the distortions in cro are induced by the chemical substitution of sr by the isovalent , but smaller ca , which is not able to fill the space between the oxygen octahedrons like sr does .",
    "so the octahedrons start to rotate and tilt in order to reduce the coordination volume around ca . by chemically substituting the smaller ti for ru , one expects a small decrease of these deformations , which is indeed realized .",

    "most interesting is the impact of the ti doping on the deformation of the ruo@xmath5 octahedron , which is a fingerprint of the lifting of orbital degeneracy@xcite .",
    "the structural change at the metal - insulator transition in pure cro is characterized by a jump of the @xmath16  lattice - constant and by a flattening of the octahedron as it is visible in the ru - o bond distance ratio@xcite . upon cooling into the insulating phase this",
    "octahedron flattening continues until it saturates at the antiferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "slightly below room temperature the octahedron shape passes from elongated to flattened @xcite .",
    "in all samples studied here , this crossover occurs below room temperature , thus at 100  k the octahedron shape is flattened for all ti substitutions , see fig .",
    "[ ruooo ] . due to flattening of the lattice and octahedron the @xmath6 orbital shifts down in energy compared to the @xmath44,@xmath45 orbitals .",
    "a similarly strong and anomalous temperature dependence is also observed for the ratio of the two o - o octahedron edge lengths parallel @xmath43 and @xmath36 which is related to the orthorhombic splitting [ @xmath46 @xcite . at room temperature",
    "the octahedron is longer along @xmath43 , while it is elongated along @xmath36 at low temperature .",
    "all these effects can be attributed to a temperature dependent orbital ordering @xcite .",
    "the considerable elongation along @xmath36 at low temperature agrees with soc and the alignment of the magnetic moment mainly along the @xmath36 direction @xcite .",
    "figure [ ruooo ] illustrates that these two distortions of the ruo@xmath5 octahedron become suppressed by the 10  % ti substitution .",
    "this underlines the orbital ordering character of these distortions , which is obviously suppressed by ti@xmath47 with an empty @xmath48 shell .    while the @xmath25  plane ( or the average in - plane parameter ) increases with high ti content , the @xmath16  lattice - constant decreases at room temperature .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath16  lattice - constant , in hand with an increase of the @xmath25  plane , is the structural signature of the insulating state of cro . with 1  % of ti substitution",

    "there are no indications for a sharp metal - insulator transition on cooling from 700 down to 80  k , where the upper experimental limit of the resistance experiment is reached .",
    "note that the absolute values of the resistivity curves are prone to a large uncertainty because of the first order structural phase transition which causes cracks in the crystals .",
    "but the orders of magnitude larger resistivity of the 10ti sample and the absence of the metal - insulator transition is unambiguous .",
    "this remarkable stabilization of the insulating state by only small amounts of ti substitution is also seen in ca@xmath24ru@xmath0o@xmath50 @xcite .",
    "since the ionic radii of ti and ru are very similar , this suppression of the metallic state seems to originate from the very effective suppression of the hopping .",

    "<S> the magnon dispersion of ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1 has been studied by polarized and unpolarized neutron scattering experiments on crystals containing 0 , 1 and 10  % of ti . </S>",
    "<S> the entire dispersion of transverse magnons can be well described by a conventional spin - wave model with interaction and anisotropy parameters that agree with density functional theory calculations . </S>",
    "<S> spin - orbit coupling strongly influences the magnetic excitations , which is most visible in large energies of the magnetic zone - center modes arising from magnetic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for a low - lying additional mode that exhibits strongest scattering intensity near the antiferromagnetic zone center . </S>",
    "<S> this extra signal can be explained by a sizable magnetic moment of 0.11 bohr magnetons on the apical oxygens parallel to the ru moment , which is found in the density functional theory calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the energy and the signal strength of the additional branch are well described by taking into account this oxygen moment with weak ferromagnetic coupling between ru and o moments . </S>"
