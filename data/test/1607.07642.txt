    "x - ray crystallography is a method for imaging molecules with atomic resolution .",
    "the usage of x - ray free electron laser ( xfel ) in femtosecond nanocrystallography involves sequential illumination of many small crystals of arbitrary orientation  @xcite .",
    "the success of nanocrystallography depends on the robustness of the procedure for pattern determination .",
    "after acquisition , diffraction patterns are analyzed to assign indexes to bragg peaks .",
    "indexing algorithms used in crystallography are used to determine the orientation of the diffraction data from a single crystal when a relatively large number of reflections are recorded .",
    "the number of bragg peaks is proportional to the bandwidth of the incident radiation pulse . with nominal scenario for beam compression and transport at the european xfel",
    "@xcite the radiation bandwidth is quite narrow  @xcite , on the level of several permilles .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that a strong beam compression could be used to increase the correlated energy spread of the electron beam and as consequence to increase the radiation bandwidth up to 2 % at photon energy 6 kev . in this paper",
    "we study another possibility : we use over - compression of the electron beam at the last chicane and insert corrugated structures before the undulator section .",
    "these structures are used to generate strong wakefields which introduce a large energy drop along the bunch  @xcite .    considering the baseline configuration of the european xfel , and based on beam dynamics simulations ,",
    "we demonstrate here that the usage of corrugated structures allows for a tenfold increase in radiation bandwidth .",
    "data collection with a 3% bandwidth , a few microjoule radiation pulse energy , a few femtosecond pulse duration , and a photon energy of 5.4 kev is possible .",
    "for this study we have developed an analytical _ modal _ representation of the short - range wake function of the flat corrugated structures for arbitrary offsets of the source and the witness particles .",
    "this representation is different from ones published so far ,  @xcite-@xcite , and agrees well with the numerical results obtained by direct numerical solution of maxwell s equations for electron bunch shapes of our interest .",
    "the european xfel is under construction now in hamburg .",
    "it contains several photon lines to produce extremely short and bright light pulses with wave length down to 0.04 nm .",
    "the layout of the accelerator ( with the undulator line sase1 ) is shown in fig .  [ fig01 ] . the linear accelerator ( linac ) contains many radio - frequency ( rf ) accelerating modules , 3rd harmonic rf module for longitudinal phase space linearization , three bunch compressors etc .",
    "beam dynamics in the accelerator with nominal set of parameters is described , for example , in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a special scenario with over - compression of the electron bunch in the last bunch compressor ( bc2 in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "the over - compression allows to obtain a bunch with lower particle energy at the tail .",
    "hence the wake fields produced by linac elements following the chicane bc2 will not compensate ( as it appears in the nominal scenario s , see  @xcite ) , but increase the energy deviation between the particles at the head and at the tail of the electron bunch . this energy difference will be enhanced later on by strong wake fields of the corrugated structures as described in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    ".parameters of the linac at the simulation . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]                     in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] we show the beta mismatch parameters  @xcite along the beam matched to the undulator entrance .",
    "we use the same eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) , but @xmath0 correspond now to the design optics at the undulator entrance , @xmath1 are the slice values along the beam .",
    "the `` ideal '' beam can be matched relatively well even at the tail .",
    "the beam from the `` start - to - end '' simulations has a larger mismatch at the head and at the tail .",
    "indeed the radiation properties depend strongly on the way of the beam matching . in our first try",
    "we have matched the beam perfectly at the middle point .",
    "but in this case the mismatch at the tail was very large ( @xmath2 ) and the radiation from the tail was suppressed heavily . the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] is obtained when we reduce the mismatch parameters along the whole bunch .",
    "the active length of the undulator is 175 meters . with the electron beam parameters under consideration the saturation of the sase radiation",
    "is reached at the position @xmath3 m. in the left plot in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] we show the averaged energy in the photon pulse along the undulator line .",
    "the radiation pulse energy at the saturation is about 3 mj .",
    "we do not use any undulator tapering and do not take into account the undulator wake fields in this study .",
    "the tapering could increase the radiation power yet by order of magnitude but the radiation bandwidth can be reduced because of it .",
    "the impact of the tapering and the undulator wakefields will be studied in another work .",
    "the rms radiation bandwidth along the undulator section is shown in the right plot in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] .",
    "it reaches 0.9% at position @xmath4 m. the radiation spectrum has not gaussian shape . in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] we show the spectrum at position @xmath5 m. the fwhm radiation bandwidth reaches here 2.8% for the electron beam from `` start - to - end '' simulations .",
    "the solid lines present the spectrum averaged over many shots .",
    "the oscillating gray lines show an one shot spectrum .    the radiation power along the pulse can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] .",
    "the radiation from the beam tail and head are suppressed partially due to impact of the wake fields on the beam quality in the corrugated structure insertion.the solid lines present the averaging over many shots .",
    "in this paper we have studied a possibility to extend the bandwith of the radiation at the european xfel with the help of a special compression scenario together with the corrugated structure insertion .",
    "we have derived an accurate modal representation of the wake function of corrugated structure and have applied this fully three dimensional wake function in beam dynamics studies in order to estimate the change of the electron beam properties . in the second part of the study",
    "we have done simulations of free electron laser physics with the electron bunches obtained from the beam dynamics simulations .",
    "it was shown that at photon energy 5.4 kev such scenario can produce a photon pulse with a 3% bandwidth , a few microjoule radiation pulse energy , and a few femtosecond pulse duration .",
    "the joule heating of the corrugated structure modules by the beam s wakefields is significant and a cooling system may be required .",
