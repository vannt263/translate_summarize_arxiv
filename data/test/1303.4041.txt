    "the hologram implies three - dimensional information with phase and amplitude of the propagating wave [ 1,2 ] .",
    "this makes it possible to retrieve the wavefront of original propagating wave by illuminating the hologram with reconstructing wave .",
    "however , in digital holography , the holography has difficulty in the recording and reconstructing processes of the hologram image because of high spatial frequency of the fringe pattern [ 3 - 5 ] .",
    "the hologram is the interference fringe of the recording wave and the object wave , and therefore , for retrieving the hologram image with sufficient viewing angle the spatial frequency gets to the extent of the wavelength of the light field .    in holographic display ,",
    "the hologram is sampled with sampling frequency of the device with pixel structure to avoid aliasing effects [ 6,7 ] .",
    "present modulator encoding hologram fringe has much lower resolution than the required specification .",
    "now , the limitation of the spatial frequency due to the device performance obstructs widening view angle of the hologram image , although the holographic display can reconstruct the image to the display size . for the realization of holographic display , solving the problem of widening viewing angle is essential .",
    "current researches for improving the viewing zone have been carried out through temporal and spatial multiplexing of the spatial light modulators [ 8 - 10 ] .",
    "multiplexing method of the hologram effectively enhances the viewing angle of the reconstructed image , whereas the large space - bandwidth product is still required .",
    "since only the high - definition resolution of the real image is sufficient , the use of the massive hologram data for generating holographic high - definition image is unreasonable .",
    "this also hinders the process of the digitized hologram data .",
    "recently , the interesting technique by using resolution redistribution of the hologram fringe was proposed to enlarge the viewing angle without a multiplexing process .",
    "the duplicated hologram fringe with increased resolution can be imaged on the image plane through an imaging system , which is implemented by a combination of the multiple point light sources and a rearrangement of the hologram data . here",
    ", only the enhancement of the horizontal parallax is possible .    in this research",
    ", we note that in principle , even the hologram with small space bandwidth has entire information of the object , and thus trying to find how to enlarge the viewing zone of the reconstructed image optically .",
    "first , for the fresnel and fourier holograms we investigate the possibility of the viewing angle change by varying an incidence angle of the illuminating plane wave .",
    "the plane wave illuminating the hologram in other direction than that of the recording process generates diffracted beams emanating to the shifted position of the reconstructed image , which can make the viewing zone with another perspective of the image .",

    "the on - axis hologram fringe is unique because it has a constant form as the modulating signal irrespective of the spatial carrier .",
    "therefore , in two cases of the on - axis holography by an inclined plane wave and the off - axis holography , there is only the variation of the carrier frequency .",

    "the viewing angle of the image by the coaxial plane wave is determined by means of the spatial frequency of the fringe pattern .",
    "since the local spatial frequency is given by @xmath8 , the viewing angle , @xmath9 is double the size of @xmath10 .",
    "the higher spatial frequency leads the wider viewing angle of the image . in the tilted plane wave , since the exponential term of a carrier frequency generates the deflected beam of the retrieved image , the viewing zone of the object image changes to new @xmath11 region in fig .",
    "we find that the tilted plane wave plays a role in a modulated carrier similar to a carrier signal of the off - axis holography , which makes the diffractive wave propagating to new optical axis direction . in the sampled hologram ,",
    "the viewing zone of the reconstructed image has a limitation because it has the bandlimit signal to the nyquist frequency to avoid the aliasing effect [ 11 ] .",
    "but , the viewing zone variation of the object image by a tilted plane wave is irrespective of the aliasing in principle .",
    "this case is different from the aliasing arising in sampling the modulated carrier signal to the hologram . here ,",
    "the modulating hologram signal of the object is already recorded in the sampled hologram , and only the inclined reconstruction wave related to the carrier signal is illuminated .",
