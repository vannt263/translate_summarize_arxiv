    "cyg x-1 has been observed several times with the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) on the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory .",
    "the first observation @xcite shows details of the structures of the ionization edges from neutral species in the interstellar medium . in particular , the o k and fe l edges showed significant structure that had been unobservable at low spectral resolution .",
    "the ne k edge was unresolved but the nearby continuum showed subtle features that could be attributed to fe xx .",
    "there were other weak , unresolved features in the spectrum that supported in the interpretation that we are observing cyg x-1 through a low density ionized gas that is associated with cyg x-1 .    a second observation with the hetgs that was taken at a different orbital phase and in a different instrument mode .",
    "we find many redshifted absorption features from highly ionized species of s , si , mg , ne , and fe . we present a preliminary analysis of this observation .",
    "cyg x-1 was observed on 12 january 2000 ( mjd = jd - 2400000.5 = 51555.34 - 5.51 ) . the orbital phase for this observation was 0.84 , based on a recent orbital ephemeris @xcite . for the first observation @xcite , the orbital phase was 0.93 , while in a third observation , the orbital phase was 0.76 , nearly perpendicular to the line between the compact and companion stars @xcite .",
    "the total exposure time was 12677.5 s. the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) detector was used for readout and was operated in the so - called `` continuous clocking '' ( cc ) mode .",
    "this mode is described in detail in the _ chandra _  proposer s observatory guide ( p. 101 ) .",
    "briefly , in this mode , the charge is shifted row by row to the frame storage buffer at 2.84996 ms intervals .",
    "imaging information along the readout direction is lost in favor of improved event timing .",
    "the _ chandra _  hetgs spectrum of cyg x-1 is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : hegspec ] and [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "a fit to a simple power law in the 2 - 10 kev band gives a photon index of 1.73 .",
    "the residuals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hegspec ] ) show that there is a soft excess that is usually attributed to a disk blackbody . in the first hetgs observation ,",
    "@xmath1 of the disk was about 200 ev @xcite .",
    "in addition to absorption edges from neutral gas in the interstellar medium , there are many narrow absorption lines .",
    "the depths of the ne k and fe l absorption edges are consistent with the edge strengths obtained from the first observation where @xmath2 was estimated to be 6.2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xcite .    in order to show the absorption lines more clearly",
    ", the hetgs medium energy grating ( meg ) and the high energy grating ( heg ) spectra were combined at a binning of 0.01 (fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "there are more than a dozen narrow absorption lines of highly ionized species , ranging from fe xvii to s xvi .",
    "the lines are redshifted by 300 to 800 km / s but are generally consistent with the weighted mean : 460 @xmath0 10 km / s ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lines ] ) .",
    "the lines are resolved in heg spectra ( and often in the lower resolution meg spectra as well ) , giving doppler line widths of order 300 km s@xmath5 ( fwhm ) . in some cases ,",
    "blends cause the lines to be broader than expected .",
    "practically no ly @xmath6 lines are detected while ly @xmath7 lines are strong , so we infer that the lines are not saturated and that the absorbing gas probably covers more than @xmath8% of the source . assuming complete coverage",
    ", we estimated column densities from fits of gaussian models jointly to the original meg and heg data .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] .",
    "the column densities are between @xmath9 @xmath4 and @xmath10 @xmath4 , which , using solar abundances , correspond to equivalent hydrogen column densities of the order of @xmath11 @xmath4 .",
    "there is trend that the column densities of he - like ions are systematically lower than the corresponding h - like ions , which could indicate that the photoionized plasma has a high temperature or the emission from these ions originate from different emission zones .",
    "we note that the result for all the fe xvii transitions are consistent with each other .",
    "we consider a simple working hypothesis in which the narrow lines result from absorption by ionized gas as it is transferred from the companion star to the black hole .",
    "the companion is a supergiant o star with a with a radiatively driven wind with a maximum velocity of @xmath12 km s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "cyg x-1 gravitationally focusses and accretes this wind from the companion @xcite although the companion may be very close to filling its roche lobe @xcite .",
    "the wind from the companion is expected to be too cool ( @xmath13 k , as in vela x-1 @xcite ) to ionize s and si to the h- and he - like states , so the ionization mechanism is most likely photoionization by the hard x - ray continuum .",
    "this continuum is thought to result from comptonization of the accretion disk s thermal radiation in an extremely hot corona , so the absorbing gas must have a much larger physical scale .",
    "in general , the wide range of observed ionization states ( fe xvii to s xvi ) would not be found in gas of a single ionization parameter , @xmath14 , so @xmath15 probably varies significantly along the line of sight .",
    "lines of these strengths were not observed in the first observation , so the conditions under which they are detected may depend on the luminosity state of the illuminating x - ray source or the orbital phase .",
    "the source was @xmath16 2 brighter during the first observation so it may be that the higher x - ray luminosity completely ionized the accreting material . on the other hand , the orbital phase was 0.93 , so the wind may have been mostly obscured by the companion star .    remarkably , we do not observe a wide spread of line velocities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] ) , but a quite narrow ( @xmath17 km s@xmath5 ) distribution around 450 km s@xmath5 . at the closest approach to the surface of the companion , about one stellar radius , the line of sight to cyg",
    "x-1 will encounter a wind velocity of order 650 km s@xmath5 . in the focussed wind model , the velocity vector",
    "is not directed strictly radially , so we observe gas that appears to be on an accretion trajectory .",
    "using solar abundances , the column density of the absorbing material is of order @xmath11 @xmath4 , which is well below the value of @xmath18 @xmath4 inferred from _ rxte _",
    "asm observations @xcite .",
    "this could indicate that we observe either a physically narrow plasma flow ( a `` streamer '' or `` ribbon '' ) or only a smaller , more distant region in the plasma flow that is either shadowed from the ionizing source or that is only partially ionized .    9    brocksopp , c. , tarasov , a.  e. , lyuty , v.  m. , & roche , p.  1999",
