    "it is expected that sim will achieve the @xmath0as mission accuracy in determination of parallaxes to a nearby stars . @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that future astrometric model for sim will have to account not only for the effects introduced by the motion of the solar system bodies , but also for those that are generated by the motion of the spacecraft and corresponding errors in the spacecraft s navigation .",
    "here we would like to analyze whether or not the future sim astrometric accuracy will be compromized by the spacecraft navigational errors .",
    "analysis of tolerable errors for position determination in a general case is a complicated problem and should be addressed by using a formal numerical treatment .",
    "however , we may simplify the task by analyzing a special case which is expected to provide the most stringent requirements on the positional accuracy .",
    "the three - dimensional vector of parallax , @xmath1 , is given by the expression : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the direction and distance to the observed source correspondingly ; and @xmath5 is the barycentric position of the observer . the overall three - dimensional geometry of the problem presented in figure [ fig : parallax ] .",
    "the involved vectors may be given in the spherical coordinate system by their magnitudes and two corresponding sky - angles : @xmath6 \\vec{r}&=&r\\big(\\cos\\lambda\\cos\\chi,~\\sin\\lambda\\cos\\chi , ~\\sin\\chi\\,\\big ) .",
    "\\label{eq : vect}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this parameterization allows one to present the expression eq.([eq : par0 ] ) in the following form : @xmath7 with vector @xmath8 given by    @xmath9\\bigg)-\\nonumber\\\\[1 mm ] & -&\\vec{e}_y\\bigg(\\cos\\alpha\\,\\cos^2\\delta\\,\\cos\\chi\\,\\sin(\\alpha-\\lambda)+ \\sin\\delta\\big[\\sin\\alpha\\,\\cos\\delta\\,\\sin\\chi- \\sin\\delta\\,\\sin\\lambda\\,\\cos\\chi\\big]\\bigg)+\\nonumber\\\\[1 mm ] & + & \\vec{e}_z\\big(\\cos^2\\delta\\,\\sin\\chi- \\sin\\delta\\,\\cos\\delta\\,\\cos\\chi\\,\\cos(\\alpha-\\lambda)\\big ) .",
    "\\label{eq : par_par } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the expressions eqs.([eq : par])-([eq : par_par ] ) may now be used to answer the question - how the positional errors @xmath10 will affect the accuracy of parallax determination , @xmath11 . to do",
    "this one needs to take the first order variations of the right - hand side of the expression ( [ eq : par ] ) with respect to positional errors @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the goal here is to present the obtained result in the form : @xmath14 this expression is quite difficult for analytical description in a general case , however , for the purposes of present study , it may be significantly simplified . to do this",
    ", we assume that motion of the spacecraft is almost in the plane of ecliptic , thus @xmath15 , but @xmath16 .",
    "we will not go into the lengthy derivations , but will present here only the final results for this algebraic exercise : @xmath17 + \\delta\\chi^2\\,\\cos^2\\delta - \\delta\\chi\\,\\delta\\lambda\\,\\sin2\\delta\\ , \\sin(\\alpha-\\lambda)\\\\   ( \\vec{\\cal p}\\cdot\\delta\\vec{\\cal p})&= & \\delta\\lambda\\,\\cos^2\\delta\\,\\sin(\\alpha-\\lambda)\\,\\cos(\\alpha-\\lambda)- \\delta\\chi\\,\\sin^3\\delta\\,\\cos\\delta\\,\\cos(\\alpha-\\lambda).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    assuming that the errors @xmath18 and @xmath19 are normally distributed and uncorrelated , one may average the obtained expressions over the period of the spacecraft s barycentric orbit . to further simplify the analysis",
    "we will assume that the orbit is circular .",
    "the latitude argument for circular motion coincides with the mean anomaly , e.q .",
    "@xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the period of orbital motion of the spacecraft . as a result ,",
    "one obtains the expression for contribution of the navigational errors to the accuracy of parallax determination : @xmath23 .",
    "\\label{eq : par00}\\ ] ]",
    "the obtained expression represents the error in parallax determination depending on the accuracy of sim navigation .",
    "we have considered the motion of the spacecraft almost in the plane of ecliptic .",
    "the three terms on the right - hand side of the expression ( [ eq : par00 ] ) represent the contributions of the radial , @xmath24 and tangential , @xmath25 , positional errors . the obtained expression valid for any source , but depends only on @xmath26 - the declination angle of the source s position .",
    "one may see that positional errors are most influencing determination of parallax for the case when the source is near the poles , or @xmath27 .",
    "thus , leading us to the final expression : @xmath28    the expression eq.([eq : par ! ] ) is somewhat familiar and it may be obtained by a much simpler way . however , the second term on the right - hand side of it is very important .",
    "this term allows one to quickly obtain the necessary result .",
    "thus , one may show that the tangential error , @xmath29 , is related to the radial one as follows @xmath30 .",
    "one may also expect that this longitudinal error in the spacecraft s position will be the same as the error in the spacecraft s velocity sky - angle @xmath31=@xmath29 . @xcite",
    "have shwon that this error was related to the velocity error by @xmath32 .",
    "this is why we may use the following relation @xmath33 to obtain the maximum error in the sim s radial distance from the sun for the entire mission . as a result",
    ", this relation suggests that the barycentric distance of the spacecraft during the whole mission should be known with an accuracy equal or better then @xmath34 km .",
    "finally , one may obtain the expression for the expected parallax errors induced by the inaccuracies in determination of the sim s solar system s barycentric position .",
    "for example , for a source located at the distance @xmath35 pc  from the sun , the corresponding expression reads : @xmath36    thus , provided that the accuracy of the spacecraft s velocity determination ( driven by the need to correct for the relativistic stellar aberration ) will be at the level of @xmath37 mm / s , the influence of the spacecraft s barycentric position errors will be negligible for the parallax determination ."
