    "the binarity of the late o - star @xmath0  ori  was discovered by @xcite using visual micrometer measurements . with the further discovery by @xcite",
    "that component @xmath0  ori  a is itself a spectroscopic binary , the determination of the orbit of components a and b by @xcite and the identification of the massive c , d , and e components @xcite and @xcite , the @xmath0  ori system is now viewed as somewhat analogous to the trapezium system of massive stars in the orion nebula .",
    "the multiple star system @xmath0  ori lies in the center of a small cluster of young lower mass stars , as first discussed by @xcite .",
    "this cluster has @xmath1  300 members with a total mass of 150  225  m@xmath4 , with ages of individual members ranging from several million years @xcite down to stars in the outflow phase @xcite and masses ranging from the massive members of the @xmath0  ori group down to objects of possibly only planetary mass @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the properties of the @xmath0  ori cluster have recently been reviewed by @xcite and we refer to references therein for more details .",
    "@xcite arrived at a main sequence - fitting distance of 420 pc , consistent with the distance to main orion ob1b association .",
    "the extinction towards the @xmath0 ori cluster is very low and can be neglected for work in the near infrared .    the discovery by @xcite of the infrared object @xmath0  ori irs1 about 3@xmath5 north of the high - mass binary @xmath0  ori a / b , associated with extended infrared emission and coinciding with a vla radio source @xcite raised the possibility that this object is a proplyd , similar to the many objects of this type found in the orion nebula .",
    "ori irs1 has been detected in x - rays by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the variability and the high temperature component in its x - ray spectrum are consistent with it containing a magnetically active low mass t tauri star .",
    "infrared images using adaptive optics by @xcite showed that @xmath0  ori  irs1 is a double source with components irs1  a and irs1  b. in this paper we present near - infrared integral - field spectroscopy of the two components of @xmath0  ori  irs1 .",
    "we had noticed the binary nature of @xmath0  ori  irs1 independently from @xcite during observations on 2007 , december 30 ( ut ) using the keck 2 telescope with the nirc2 near - infrared camera and natural guide star adaptive optics under non - photometric conditions .",
    "the image in the br@xmath6 filter is shown as part of fig .  1 .",
    "we observed @xmath0  ori  irs1 again with the oh - suppressing infrared integral field spectrograph ( osiris ) @xcite at keck 2 on the night of 2008 , aug .",
    "21 , ut , under excellent weather conditions using the finest scale of 20 mas pixel@xmath7 .",
    "the quality of these observations allowed a detailed study of the @xmath0  ori  irs1  b emission spectrum in the _ h _ and _ k _ windows ( figs .  2 and 3 ) and the spectral classification of both components of the binary star system @xmath0  ori  irs1 ( figs .",
    "4 ) . for the _ k_-band observations , we used spectra of the multiple o and b star system @xmath0  ori  a / b as the atmospheric absorption standard , after interpolation across the strong br@xmath6 absorption line , and multiplied the ratio spectra by the spectrum of a 30750 k blackbody , the t@xmath8 of an o9.5v star @xcite . we did not obtain calibration spectra of @xmath0  ori  a / b in the _ h_-band .",
    "therefore , the _ h_-band spectrum of @xmath0  ori  irs1  b in fig .  2 used the m1 star @xmath0  ori  irs1",
    "a as the atmospheric absorption standard , and the ratio spectrum was multiplied by the spectrum of the m1v star hd42581 from the spectral library of @xcite , to establish the proper continuum .",
    "the spectrum in fig .  2 was separately flux calibrated in the _ h _ and _ k _ bands by multiplying the spectrum with the 2mass spectral response curves , integrating the flux , using the 2mass flux calibration of @xcite , and then scaling the result to match the published _",
    "h _ and _ ks _ magnitudes of @xcite .",
    "we also obtained optical seeing - limited slit - less spectroscopy using the wide field grism spectrograph 2 ( wfgs2 ) @xcite at the uh 2.2 m telescope in an effort to detect the h@xmath9 line from @xmath0  ori  irs1  b. the images were obtained on the night of 2008 , october 11 , ut , under near - photometric conditions .",
    "this wide - field collimator - camera system was used without a slit , with a narrow - band h@xmath9 filter ( 10 nm fwhm ) as a spectral selector , and with the high - resolution grating , resulting in a dispersion of 0.085 nm pixel@xmath7 . as a result",
    ", all stars are dispersed into short continua , covering the transmission range of the h@xmath9 filter .",
    "the central area of the resulting image is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the emission - line dominated @xmath0  ori  irs1  b is easily seen in the resulting slit - less spectroscopy image as the only object near the @xmath0  ori system that appears as an unresolved dot of h@xmath9 emission , without detectable continuum or velocity structure .",
    "the median age of the @xmath0 ori cluster is 2 - 3  myr @xcite , so that all low mass objects are still contracting , and are therefore larger , more luminous , and have lower surface gravity than main sequence stars .",
    "when attempting to classify their spectra , it is usually found that their features fall between those of luminosity class v and iii , but closer to class v , as was shown in the early work by @xcite and @xcite . in mid to late m spectral types , the ratio of the strength of the co bandheads to that of the atomic lines , as well as the ratio of the two components of the na doublet ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , are luminosity dependent and the latter show that both @xmath0 ori irs1 components are indeed much closer to luminosity class v than to class iii .",
    "the spectral classification of the two components of @xmath0 ori irs1 relies on the strongest molecular feature in the atmospheric _ k _ window , the co bandheads , and on the atomic line systems of na , ca , mg , and the complex of fe and ti lines at 2.23  @xmath10 m .",
    "the spectral classification was done by discussion of features in direct comparison ( fig .",
    "4 ) with the irtf / spex spectral library of @xcite .      in the spectrum of irs1 a in fig .",
    "4 the absorption line systems of na and ca are of almost equal strength . the absorption line of mg at 2.282 @xmath10 m is clearly detected .",
    "this is most closely matched by the comparison spectrum of m1v type that also reproduces the shape of the fe and ti complex at 2.23 @xmath10 m best . for",
    "later spectral types ( m3v ) , the mg line is too weak and the shortest wavelength component of the ca feature becomes too strong . for even earlier spectral types ,",
    "mg becomes too strong , and the line ratios of the ca and the fe and ti multiplets do not match @xmath0 ori irs1 a. the co bandheads in irs1 a are stronger compared to na and ca than in m1v spectral types , as it would be expected for an object of higher than main sequence luminosity . we conclude that a spectral type of m1v is the closest match to the spectrum of irs1 a with an uncertainty of one decimal sub - class , the caveat being that irs1 a is more luminous than a main sequence object and that it is young . following @xcite , this gives its effective temperature as 3705  @xmath11  150  k.    from the k@xmath12 magnitude of 10.48 @xcite and with colors and bolometric corrections from @xcite , we arrive at a rough estimate for the luminosity of @xmath0 ori irs1 a of 0.86  @xmath13 .",
    "comparison of these t@xmath8 and l data with the 1998 revisions of the @xcite evolutionary tracks in fig .",
    "5 places @xmath0 ori irs1 a on the track of a 0.3 m@xmath4 star with a nominal age of 0.3 myrs . compared to the 1 myr isochrone of the @xcite and @xcite models @xmath0 ori irs1 a appears to be a star of 0.8 m@xmath4 and an age of @xmath11 myr .",
    "the errors indicated in fig .",
    "5 represent the uncertainty of @xmath111 subclass in spectral type determination , and the estimated total error from the uncertainty in bolometric corrections values @xcite , color transformations , and photometric errors .",
    "as discussed both by @xcite and @xcite , the evolutionary models themselves are still quite uncertain at these young ages , adding another caveat to the interpretation of the results .",
    "the best fit to the line ratios of @xmath0  ori  irs1  b is a m7 or m8 star on the basis of the detection of na lines and non - detection of ca lines , and the ratio of na to co bandhead strength .",
    "however , all these late m class v stars have much stronger lines ( both the na and the co bandhead lines ) than @xmath0  ori  irs1  b , so in order to match the spectrum , we have to postulate an additional , diluting continuum component to the spectrum . as we will discuss in detail in section 4 .",
    "the strong spatially extended br@xmath6 and hei emission suggests that @xmath0  ori  irs1  b is a proplyd in the process of being photo - evaporated by uv radiation from the ob stars in the @xmath0  ori  a / b system .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that some dust in the proplyd gets heated by uv absorption to temperatures near the sublimation point , and that its emission dilutes the photospheric emission from the embedded star .",
    "however fig .",
    "3 clearly shows that the line emission is more extended than the continuum , which appears unresolved .",
    "it is also possible that part of the hot dust emission originates much closer to the star and is powered by an accretion disk .",
    "our data are not sufficient to uniquely identify a combination of dust opacity and temperature to best match the spectrum , but solutions with dust temperatures in the range of 1000 k and contributions of about 50 % of dust emission to the total flux give good matches to the line depths . fig .  4",
    "therefore compares the spectrum of @xmath0  ori  irs1  b , expanded by a factor of 2 to account for the dilution of the lines , with archival spectra of mid - m stars ( above ) and m8-l1 stars and an m7iii star below .",
    "this comparison places the spectral type of @xmath0  ori  irs1  b in the range from m6 to m9 .",
    "a spectral type as early as m6 is consistent with the data when we consider that for lower gravity atmospheres , the na is fainter and the co bandheads are stronger than for main sequence stars . on the other extreme ,",
    "the m9 class is still compatible with the data , considering the substantial errors .",
    "a spectral type of m5 can be excluded with confidence , since the ca feature would be much too strong , and on the other side , a l1 or later type can be excluded since those types do not show na absorption .",
    "we therefore nominally classify @xmath0  ori  irs1  b as m7.5 , i.e. , the midpoint of the range of possible spectral types .",
    "we assume as the effective temperature of @xmath0 ori irs1 b the average of the effective temperatures given for m7 and m8 in @xcite : 2795 k with a range of uncertainty between 2400 k ( m9v ) and 3000 k ( m6v ) .",
    "while it is clear from its luminosity and age that @xmath0  ori  irs1  b is not a main sequence star , its spectrum does not show , within the limitations of the signal - to - noise ratio , any specific features related to lower surface gravity .",
    "nevertheless , it should be classified as luminosity class iv .    with a measured _ k@xmath12_=12.65 from @xcite",
    ", we obtain an m@xmath14 of 7.10 using colors and bolometric corrections from @xcite and a luminosity of l = 0.109  l@xmath4 .",
    "the errors indicated in fig .",
    "5 represent the uncertainty in the determination of the spectral type , and the maximum effect of a factor of 2 in luminosity from either including or excluding the dust emission in the determination of the luminosity .",
    "it places @xmath0  ori  irs1  b on the evolutionary track of a 0.10 @xmath2 object in the 1998 revisions of the @xcite models ( fig .",
    "5 ) near the 0.3 myr age isochrone .",
    "we also plot the 1 myr isochrone of the models by @xcite and @xcite and note that @xmath0  ori  irs1  b is well above this isochrone .",
    "the differences between both models illustrate the problems with theoretical hr diagrams at young ages that the authors of those models are well aware of @xcite . as an alternative to comparing with evolutionary models",
    ", we can compare @xmath0  ori  irs1  b directly to the components of young the eclipsing binary 2massj05352184 - 0546085 in the orion nebula whose masses have been directly measured by @xcite .",
    "this star s primary component of m6.5@xmath110.5 spectral type has a measured mass of 0.0541 @xmath2 while the slightly hotter secondary component has a mass of 0.0340 @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath0  ori  irs1  b is of later spectral type than either of the components of this eclipsing binary and is probably of similar age , it seems certain that @xmath0  ori  irs1  b has a sub - stellar mass below 0.05 @xmath2 .",
    "finally , in a strong uv radiation environment , the photospheric temperature may be elevated above what an isolated object of otherwise identical properties might have , which would lead to an overestimate for the mass .",
    "the emission line spectrum in the _ h _ and _ k _ bands of @xmath0  ori  irs1  b is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by strong emission from the brackett series of hi and by emission lines of hei .",
    "there is , however , no detectable emission from shock - excited h@xmath3 in the s(1 ) lines , nor is there forbidden line emission in the 1.644@xmath10 m emission line of [ feii ] , which is often associated with outflow activity in young stars .",
    "emission lines are one of the defining characteristics @xcite of classical t tauri stars and in those stars originate from the accretion disk . in the case of @xmath0  ori  irs1  b ,",
    "however , our spatially resolved line images show that the br@xmath6 and hei emission lines do not originate in an accretion disk very close to the stellar surface .",
    "rather , the line emission is spatially extended by 95 mas fwhm in the case of the br@xmath6 line , and similar for hei , while the psf is 55 mas fwhm .",
    "the brightest emission is offset towards the illuminating ob stars as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 . on the other hand",
    ", the emission lines do not show a pronounced bow - shock morphology , indicating that we are not seeing irs1 b being illuminated side - on .",
    "this finding agrees with the morphology of the 10 @xmath10 m emission found by @xcite who did not see the bow shock structure often found at 10 @xmath10 m in side - on orion proplyds by @xcite .",
    "while the proplyd irs1 b was easily detected in h@xmath9 emission , its surface brightness falls well short of the prediction by @xcite of being equal to the @xmath0  ori  a / b continuum in a 1 nm wavelength interval . calibrating the continuum flux of @xmath0  ori  a / b against the spectrophotometry by @xcite of the hst o9vp calibration star hd93521",
    ", we get an h@xmath9 flux for the unresolved h@xmath9 emission knot from @xmath0  ori  irs1  b of 4.7  10@xmath15  wm@xmath16 .",
    "the dust that @xcite detected in thermal emission probably absorbs much the h@xmath9 emission that would be expected based on extrapolation from the radio spectrum .",
    "the formation of low - mass objects by photo - evaporation of prestellar cores near massive stars has been discussed by @xcite , and our data indicate that @xmath0  ori  irs1  b appears to show this process in action .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two components of the @xmath0  ori  irs1 system show very different spectra .",
    "the more luminous component irs1  a shows a pure photospheric absorption line spectrum without evidence for dust veiling or emission lines . assuming that the two components are indeed physically close to each other , and that irs1 a is therefore exposed to the same intense uv radiation field as irs1 b , it can be concluded that irs1 a must be without a disk or envelope .",
    "while distant encounter between stars in the dense cores of clusters are efficient at stripping the outer parts of disks @xcite , the complete lack of any sign of circumstellar matter around the more massive component a of the irs1 system can only be explained by dynamical effects within that system .",
    "it can be speculated that irs1 a itself might be a very close binary whose formation may have destroyed the disk , in a scenario similar to those discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 ori  irs1  b is not the only object undergoing photoevaporation in the uv radiation field of @xmath0  ori  a and b. in a recent paper , @xcite showed that the t tauri star so587 in the @xmath0 ori cluster shows emission lines that can best be interpreted in a photoevaporation scenario .",
    "we have obtained optical and near - infrared spectroscopy of the binary object @xmath0  ori  irs1  a and b. component @xmath0  ori  irs1  a shows a pure photospheric absorption line spectrum of m1 type and is a low mass star .",
    "component b of the @xmath0  ori  irs1 binary shows a compound dust and photospheric spectrum . after accounting for the dust continuum veiling ,",
    "@xmath0  ori  irs1  b itself can be classified as a m7 or m8 spectral type and probably is of sub - stellar mass .",
    "further , irs1 b shows a strong emission line spectrum with the brackett series of h and hei lines in the near infrared , and h@xmath9 in the optical .",
    "the line images in the br@xmath6 and hei ( 2.06 @xmath10 m ) lines show that the source of the line emission is an extended envelope around the star .",
    "this envelope of @xmath0  ori  irs1  b is clearly being photo - evaporated by the uv radiation field of @xmath0  ori  a.      some of the data presented herein were obtained at the w.m .",
