    "optically induced temperature changes in liquid crystals are at the origin of interesting nonlinear behaviors @xcite . indeed , due to the light absorption , thermal effects can change the physical properties of the liquid crystal , which in turn affects the light propagation in the medium . among the examples of thermal effects",
    ", we can distinguish between a direct change of the refractive indices , often referred to as thermal indexing , and the variation with the temperature of other physical parameters , such as the elastic constants , which may influence the light propagation as well . in the latter case",
    ", thermal effects might be responsible for director reorientation , and are thus referred to as thermomechanical effects .",
    "previously , light - induced thermomechanical effects have been largely investigated in cholesteric liquid crystals , where these effects were originally related with the absence of the right - left symmetry @xcite .",
    "then it became clear that such effects might also exist in systems which possesses this symmetry , such as the nematic liquid crystals ( nlc ) .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , thermomechanical effects do give a contribution to the director , heat and navier - stokes equations .",
    "these thermomechanical terms are given by nonlinear combinations with respect to temperature , director and velocity gradients and represent nonlinear cross couplings between them .",
    "the first question which arose is to suggest an experiment for measuring the magnitude of thermomechanical coefficients .",
    "indeed , it is hardly possible to find a setup which leads to the contribution of one of the coefficients only .",
    "since for uniformly aligned nematics no thermomechanical effects are expected , the hybrid - oriented nematics were used in the experiments @xcite . there",
    ", the hydrodynamic flow appeared as a result of the applied temperature gradient , which allowed to find the magnitude for the thermomechanical coefficients .",
    "laser induced thermomechanical effects in dye - doped nematics have been envisaged in preliminary experiments @xcite .",
    "however , it was not possible to derive a definitive conclusion due to the main difficulty of separating thermomechanical contributions from the light - induced molecular torque .",
    "another problem when performing these experiments is that of avoiding to approach the nematic - isotropic transition , where an enhancement of the nonlinear optical response of dye - doped nematics could take place because of other effects , such as the weakening of the anchoring @xcite .    here , we study theoretically the thermomechanical effects which occur in uniformly aligned dye - doped nematic liquid crystals .",
    "this happens when the sample is illuminated by a laser beam with a wavelength in the absorption band of the dye , which causes a significant heating of the liquid crystal layer .",
    "note that the absorbtion is negligible for pure nematics , so that thermomechanical effects are significant only for dye - doped nematics .",
    "indeed , in the presence of dye - doping thermal heating leads to an additional torque which acts onto the director together with the light - induced torque .",
    "this additional torque will help either to destabilize or stabilize the initial orientation which is determined by the ratio of the thermomechanical coefficients .",
    "we show that the additional torque might be strong enough to induce the molecular reorientation well before the onset of the light - induced molecular reorientation , the so called optical fredericksz transition ( oft ) for pure liquid crystals @xcite and janossy effect for dye - doped liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "we account for the possible decrease of the reorientation threshold by a 1d model that assumes homogenous intensity distribution in the plane of the layer ( the plane wave approximation ) and includes the light absorption into the hydrodynamic equations for the nematics .",
    "in dye - doped nematics , contrary to the pure ones , the oft lowering might happen not only because of the well known janossy effect @xcite but also because thermomechanical effects may add a significant contribution .",
    "indeed , as a consequence of light absorption , light propagation in dye - doped nematics causes significant heating of the lc .",
    "when the intensity of a beam is sufficiently large and temperature gradient becomes nonzero , an additional force acting on the director and additional terms in the stress tensor in navier - stokes equation for the velocity appear due to thermomechanical effect @xcite .",
    "the equation for the velocity is coupled with the director equation , so any dynamical process that leads to director reorientation will also induce flow even in the absence of pressure gradients .",
    "it should be noted that the terms which describe the thermomechanical effects appear not only in the director but also in navier - stokes equations .",
    "thus , neglecting the velocity equations and considering only the director equation may lead to misleading results , even though this simplification has been done for many studies in the context of light induced instabilities .    in our case",
    ", we considered the full problem with the velocity equations coupled to the director reorientation equation .",
    "however , in order to calculate the shift of the oft threshold due to the thermomechanical effect we employed another frequently used simplification , namely that all variables depend only on one coordinate , which is transversal to the plane of the nematic layer ( 1d assumption ) .",
    "we thus considered a linearly - polarized plane wave incident perpendicularly on a layer of a dye - doped nematic of thickness @xmath0 that is sandwiched between two substrates of thickness @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_geom ] ) .",
    "the cell has initially homeotropic alignment ( with strong homeotropic anchoring at the boundaries ) and is placed in a thermostage with a temperature @xmath2 on both sides .",
    "the light is polarized along the @xmath3-direction and propagates along the positive @xmath4-axis .",
    "for simplicity we also assumed that i ) the attenuation of the light inside the nematic is small [ i.e. @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the incident intensity ] ; ii ) the transversal heat flow occurring in the @xmath7 plane is neglected , i.e. the temperature profile depends only on @xmath8 , @xmath9 . since we deal with the plane - wave approximation the following 1d steady - state heat conductivity equations in the nematic and substrates can be written ( note that an absorption takes place only inside the nematic ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the parallel component of the heat conductivity tensor of the nematic , @xmath12 is the heat conductivity of the substrates and @xmath13 is the absorption coefficient for the ordinary light .",
    "we then write the boundary conditions given by continuity conditions of the temperature and the heat flow at the substrate - nematic interfaces ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) : @xmath16 in this simplest model the temperature profile is linear inside the substrates and has a parabolic form inside the nematic which is symmetric with respect to the center of the layer @xmath17 .",
    "the maximal temperature is at the center of the layer and the maximal temperature difference inside the nematic is @xmath18 .",
    "the temperature gradient inside the nematic can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the incident intensity normalized to the threshold intensity of the oft for a dye - doped nematic @xcite @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the dielectric anisotropy and @xmath23(@xmath24 ) is the dielectric permittivity ( at optical frequency ) perpendicular ( parallel ) to @xmath25 , @xmath26 phenomenologically describes the effect of certain dye dopants ( @xmath27 in a pure lc ) , @xmath28 is the bend elastic constant of the nematic and @xmath29 is the velocity of light in the vacuum .    it should be noted that the obtained solution ( [ tn_grad ] ) for the temperature profile inside the nematics is much simpler than in reality . the more complicated solution for gaussian incident beams has been derived in @xcite from 2d heat equation which includes transversal dependence .",
    "it turned out that for large gaussian beams i.e. when the spot size @xmath30 is much larger than the thickness of the layer @xmath0 , @xmath31 , the maximum temperature rise , @xmath32 , becomes proportional to the spot size .",
    "such a behavior is not predicted by the 1d model and is owing to the transversal heat flow occurring in the plane of the layer . nevertheless , the realization of the plane wave approximation in the experiment is difficult but not impossible task .",
    "one of the way to proceed is to enlarge the gaussian beam to a size which is much larger than the medium working area ( which is much stronger condition then @xmath31 ) , so that the intensity can be considered uniform in the central part .",
    "another possibility is that of using the so - called flat - top beams @xcite .",
    "both techniques are quite easily accessible and allow to attain the threshold for oft .",
    "preliminary experiments are running at present in our laboratory and will be reported elsewhere .",

    "( [ bas_nav_st ] ) is written in terms of the six leslie coefficients @xmath39@xcite and the thermomechanical tensor @xmath40 is introduced in @xcite .",
    "then , the incompressibility condition ( @xmath35 is constant ) @xmath41 and the no - slip boundary conditions @xmath42 immediately ensure that the @xmath8 component of the velocity vanishes @xmath43 , so @xmath33 is parallel to the plane of the layer .",
    "moreover , all convective derivatives @xmath44 vanish . the navier - stokes equation has been simplified then due to the fact that the director relaxation time @xmath45 differs by many orders of magnitude with the momentum diffusion time @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the rotational viscosity .",
