    "pulsating white dwarf ( wd ) stars provide a unique opportunity to probe their internal structure by comparing the observed spectrum of pulsation periods with the predictions of detailed asteroseismic models .",
    "several different families of pulsating wds are known and they all occupy fairly well defined instability regions in the @xmath4@xmath5  plane @xcite . the largest class of pulsating wds are the so - called zz ceti ( or dav ) stars which are found in a narrow range of effective temperature with 11,000  @xmath6 @xmath4  @xmath6 12,500  k @xcite . as these wds cool and enter the instability strip , they become unstable to non - radial @xmath7-mode oscillations driven by a hydrogen partial ionization zone .",
    "recently , the discovery of pulsations in several extremely low - mass ( elm ) wds has demonstrated that the canonical zz ceti instability strip extends to considerably lower surface gravities ( 5 @xmath8 @xmath5  @xmath8 7 ) @xcite .",
    "the ongoing elm survey ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , has led to the identification of seven pulsating elm wds @xcite including the unique system psr  j1738 + 0333  @xcite .",
    "these empirical results have been complimented by the theoretical work of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "recently , a pair of pulsating stars with evolutionary ties to elm wds was discovered . the class of el cvn - type binaries outlined in @xcite are considered to be precursors to elm wd systems .",
    "the pre - elm wds in the el cvn - type systems wasp  j2047@xmath925b  and wasp  j1628 + 10b  have been shown to pulsate @xcite .",
    "these pre - elm wds are located outside the boundaries of the extended zz ceti instability strip and thus their pulsations can not be explained by the usual driving mechanism ascribed to partially ionized hydrogen .",
    "instead , @xcite require significant amounts of helium in the driving region to explain the observed @xmath2-mode pulsations in these stars .",
    "@xcite have shown that between the zz ceti instability and the v777 her instability strip for helium atmosphere wds , a continuum of instability strips exist as the composition of the atmosphere is varied from pure h to pure he .",
    "this phenomenon has recently been explored in greater detail for the elm wd regime by @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the pulsators in the two wasp systems and the predictions of mixed - atmosphere pulsators outside the confines of the traditional instability strips , spurred us to take a closer look at objects from the elm survey where the presence of he in the atmosphere had clearly been detected .",
    "in all , six candidates were considered .",
    "these include j0751@xmath90141 , j1141 + 3850 , j1157 + 0546 , j1238 + 1946 , j1625 + 3632 @xcite , and j0756 + 6704 @xcite . in section  2",
    "we describe the pulsation models for these candidates and in section  3 we present our timeseries photometric observations . in section  4 , we discuss each of the newly discovered pulsators individually and we conclude in section  5 by discussing the implications of these new discoveries and we consider future avenues of research .",
    "we carried out exploratory stability calculations with the help of the montral pulsation codes @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium models that we constructed are envelope models  entirely suitable for investigating the stability problem  specified by the fixed values of the effective temperature , surface gravity , mass , and a variable value of the envelope composition ( a varying mixture of h and he ) .",
    "mode driving , if any , is associated only with the partial ionization of h and he as these models assume @xmath10 .",
    "some of our results are depicted in figure [ fg : periods ] , where we show the behavior of the spectrum of excited @xmath2-modes ( with @xmath11 = 0 in this specific example ) as a function of the mass fraction of h in the envelope . in all three cases ,",
    "we find h / he mixtures that could potentially lead to pulsations with 200  800  s periods .",
    "none of the @xmath7-modes investigated ( extending in period up to 10,000  s ) were found to be excited in our models .",
    "in addition , no excitation  @xmath2- or @xmath7-mode  was found in similar models for the three other spectroscopic targets initially considered ( i.e. j0751@xmath90141 , j1238 + 1946 , and j1625 + 3632 ) .",
    "the dotted blue lines correspond to the 1-@xmath12 uncertainties on the he abundance in the photosphere of each pre - elm wd .",
    "whether the he is a product of a recent shell flash or has not yet settled out of the atmosphere following the formation of the wd , it is reasonable to assume that the he abundance increases as a function of depth in the star and could thus be higher in the driving region .",
    "this would effectively move the dotted blue lines to the left and make our models more unstable to pulsations .",
    "we obtained timeseries photometry of j0756 + 6704 ( @xmath7  =  16.38  mag ; hereafter j0756 ) using the smithsonian astrophysical observatory s 1.2  m telescope at the fred lawrence whipple observatory equipped with keplercam @xcite on 2016 january 16 .",

    "* ) on 2016 february 17 as part of the queue program gn-2016a - q-59 . to reduce the read - out time and the telescope overhead to @xmath3  15  s , we binned the chip by 4  @xmath13  4 , resulting in a plate scale of 0.29 arcsec pixel@xmath14 .",
    "we obtained 289  @xmath13  10  s exposures over 2  hr for j1141 and 207  @xmath13  20  s exposures over 2  hr for j1157 . in both cases",

    "conditions were photometric with a median seeing of @xmath3  0.7  arcsec",
    ".    for reductions and calibrations we use the standard image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) routines and gemini gmos routines under iraf coupled with the daily bias and twilight sky frames . for j0756 ( j1141 and j1157 ) , we identify 22 ( 7 , 4 ) non - variable reference stars that are on the same ccd and amplifier as the target and use them to calibrate the differential photometry .",
    "we used the period04 package @xcite to compute fourier transforms ( fts ) from the light curves of all three targets and extracted the significant pulsation frequencies .",
    "pulsation frequencies are taken as significant if the amplitude exceeds 4@xmath15 where @xmath15 is the mean amplitude of the ft from 0 to the nyquist frequency .    in figure",

    ", we detect three significant modes with periods of 325 , 346 , and 368  s and relative amplitudes of 1.12 , 0.56 and 0.51% , respectively .",
    "overall , the three significant periods are shorter and have larger relative amplitudes than the modes observed in j0756",
    ".    of potential interest in the case of j1141 is the spacing of the observed pulsation modes .",
    "the frequency spacings separating the three modes are 187  @xmath16  16  @xmath26hz and 167  @xmath16  21  @xmath26hz , which agree within the uncertainties . if these spacings are in fact equal , then it is possible that we are observing a triplet produced by the rotational splitting of an @xmath11  =  1 mode .",
    "if we assume this is correct , we can estimate the rotation period of j1141 . taking a weighted mean of the two spacings yields an average spacing of 178  @xmath16  13  @xmath26hz which corresponds to a relatively short rotational period of 1.6  @xmath16  0.1  hr .",
    "we stress that rotational splitting is only one potential explanation for the observed periods .",
    "it is more likely that we have detected @xmath2-mode periodicities with different values of the degree @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , the spacings between consecutive periods are too small for all three modes to belong to the same degree value . on the other hand ,",
    "the period difference of 43  s between the two extreme values is comparable to what theory suggests in that period range for two adjacent modes with the same @xmath11 value , i.e. , @xmath2740  s. this would also account for the difference between the middle period of 346  s and the possible period of 384  s , both of them belonging to a different value of @xmath11 than the pair 325 - 368  s.      j1157 is a @xmath4  =  11870  @xmath16  260  k , @xmath5  =  4.81  @xmath16  0.13 pre - elm wd with @xmath17 ( he / h )  @xmath28 , @xmath19  =  0.186  @xmath16  0.011  @xmath1  at a distance of 9.2  @xmath16  1.9  kpc @xcite .",
    "it is found in a 0.56500  days orbit with a companion that has a minimum mass of 0.46  @xmath16  0.05  @xmath1 .",
    "the bottom panels of figure  [ fg : lcft ] show the gmos light curve and ft for j1157 .",
    "we detect a single significant periodicity at 364  s with a relative amplitude of 0.66  % .",
    "this is perfectly consistent with the predictions of the models shown in figure  [ fg : periods ] .",
    "however , given that only a single period is detected in j1157 , it is impossible to draw any detailed conclusions with regards to the exact pulsation mode that is observed .",
    "the discovery of these three new pulsating , mixed - atmosphere , pre - elm wds represents yet another success of the predictive power of non - adiabatic pulsation theory . in figure",
    "[ fg : strip ] we plot the location of the three new pulsators in the @xmath4@xmath5  plane along with the previously known elm wd pulsators which lie within the confines of the extended zz ceti instability strip .",
    "given the remarkable similarities in the atmospheric parameters of all three targets , it could appear at first glance as if these pre - elm wds form an entirely new class of pulsators .",
    "those stars are certainly different from the more compact pulsating elm wds found in the zz ceti instability strip illustrated in figure  [ fg : strip ] .",
    "first , they are @xmath2-mode pulsators whereas the latter are all @xmath7-mode variables with much longer periods - mode was reported by @xcite in j1112 + 1117 , but the evidence is marginal and has not been confirmed . ] .",
    "second , the driving process in the three objects described here is dominated by the usual @xmath29-mechanism  with some contribution from convective driving  whereas the zz ceti elms are excited by convective driving at the base of a pure h ionization zone .",
    "third , the three stars of interest have mixed h / he atmosphere - envelope compositions  the presence of he playing a critical role in the driving process  whereas the zz",
    "ceti elms are excited by a mechanism that occurs in pure h layers .    on the other hand ,",
    "the three new pulsators bear a strong similarity with the other currently known pre - elm wd pulsators found in the el cvn - type binaries wasp  j2047@xmath925b  and wasp  j1628 + 10b  @xcite .",
    "the latter are also @xmath2-mode variables with periods in the same range as those reported here and they occupy the same general region in the spectroscopic hertzprung  russell diagram ,",
    "i.e. , on the contracting branches of the evolutionary tracks ( see figure [ fg : strip ] ) .",
    "indeed , there is a significant difference in the mean densities of the new pre - elm pulsators versus the pulsators in the el cvn systems . based on our estimates of the mass and radius of the pre - elm wd pulsators from the @xcite models , we calculate mean densities of @xmath3  16 , 19 , 12 g/@xmath30 for j0756 , j1141 , and j1157 , respectively . in contrast , the mean density for wasp  j2047@xmath925b  and wasp  j1628 + 10b  is @xmath3  5  g/@xmath30 .",
    "in addition , the companions in the el cvn systems are well - constrained through the observed eclipses and that they are double - lined systems .",
    "it is clear that for both wasp systems the companions are main sequence a stars .",
    "in contrast , the pre - elm wd binaries are all single - lined systems where the unseen companion is assumed to be a cooler , more massive wd .    because the spectra of the pulsating pre - elm wd components in the el cvn systems are heavily polluted by the light of the a - star companions , it has been difficult to infer their atmospheric he abundance ; this important quantity is still not available . if these objects belong to the same class of pulsators as the three pre - elm wds reported in this paper , he must necessarily be present in substantial quantity in the atmospheres of the pre - elm wd components of the el cvn systems .",
    "according to this scheme , the he content in wasp  j2047@xmath925b  should be roughly comparable to the the values we need for explaining the existence of the three pulsators discussed here , while it should be significantly lower ( by perhaps a factor of 2 by mass fraction ) in the cooler wasp  j1628 + 10b  which would be part of a different instability strip than the former .",
    "this situation is analogous to the continuum of instability strips discussed by @xcite in the context of mixed h / he atmosphere wds of the gw lib type .",
    "helium is the key ingredient that allows j0756 , j1141 , and j1157 , as well as the two wasp pulsators , to be unstable to pulsations .",
    "consequently , understanding why the he is present , and in such significant quantity is fundamental if we are to explain why these unique pre - elm wds exist .",
    "the evolutionary sequences of @xcite and @xcite predict that elm wds within a certain mass range will experience one or more h shell flashes as they evolve .",
    "indeed , @xcite suggested that the observed he and metals such as ca were possibly the result of a recent shell flash .",
    "the shell flash produces he and could also mix up the interior of the star sufficiently to bring metals back to the surface .",
    "however , the masses inferred for the three new pulsating pre - elm wds are below the mass threshold for which shell flashes are expected .",
    "this is particularly true for the @xcite models , which require @xmath19  >  0.21  @xmath1  for shell flashes to occur .",
    "if shell flashes are not the source of the he , then it is likely that the he in these particular pre - elm wds is simply left over from the formation of the wd itself and has not completely diffused out of the atmosphere yet .",
    "if this scenario is correct , then our estimate of the h layer mass is particularly useful .",
    "our preliminary estimate of @xmath31 for j0756 implies a relatively thick surface h layer , which is consistent with the evolutionary models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "extensive follow - up observations of these new mixed - atmosphere , pulsating pre - elm wds will be useful in identifying all of their periodicities . as j0756 is the brightest of the three targets ,",
    "it is well - suited for an extended observing campaign .",
    "simultaneous multicolor photometry in three or more bands would be particularly useful for proper mode identification as the relationship between pulsation amplitude and wavelength is directly related to the @xmath11 value of the observed mode .",
    "a detailed asteroseismic analysis of such observations would help constrain the internal structure of these pre - elm wds .",
    "as our preliminary analysis portends , the mass of h at the surface could be constrained and lead to improved evolutionary models .",
