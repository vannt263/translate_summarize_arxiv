    "what is important here from mathematical point of view , is that the risk here involves market and non - market factors , which means that it can not be dealt using just real expectations probability measure .",
    "this is usually neglected by insurance companies although this neglectance oposses widely accepted black - scholes approach .",
    "mathematically speaking we ask for minimal @xmath0 ensuring the probability of satysfying all the claims @xmath1\\geq 0.995 $ ] , where @xmath3 denotes the contingent claim and @xmath4 denotes the value of hedging portfolio at time t. equivalently we can fix the capital look for strategy wieth maximal probability of successful hedging    this problem was solved in literature only for complete markets ( besides sekine @xcite and klusik & palmowski @xcite ) , i.e for financial positions which do nt allow for typical insurance risk .",

    "finally they consider the case where the drift of the wealth process is a nonlinear ( concave ) function of the investment strategy of the agent .",
    "klusik , palmowski , zwierz @xcite solve the problem of the quantile hedging from the point of view of a better informed agent acting on the market .",
    "the additional knowledge of the agent is modelled by a filtration initially enlarged by some random variable .",

    "they construct optimal strategy for both : maximal probability and maximal expected success ratio . in their framework",
    "the knowledge about the insurance event is not revealed before the maturity .    in this paper we state a general problem of optimizing probability of non - insolvency @xmath5 $ ] in a incomplete market , as in klusik & palmowski @xcite , but we allow very general flow of information outside the market and very general space of possible non - market events . as it was said at the beginning the solution of this problem",
    "gives a solution to solvency ii problem .",
    "in fact the solution could be used not only for solvency ii , but also for pricing instruments in incomplete markets .",
    "this would include equity - linked or options on illiquid assets or traded only over - the - counter .",
    "the replicating strategy can not be built in such case .",
    "it may suggest to price the option as an expectation in subjective probability measure or as the cost of superhedging ( very costly ! ) . from practical point of view",
    "very often it may be more apprioprate to hedge the claim with some dependent ( for example correlated ) liquid asset and smartly allow some risk , what actually to our knowledge is done by many ( also of worldwide recognition ) financial institutions without quantitive tools .",
