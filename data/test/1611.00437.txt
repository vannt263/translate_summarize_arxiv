    "the visible matter distribution of the universe forms a complex web - like network composed of filaments and sheets separated by voids ( bond et al .  1996 ; aragn - calvo et al .",
    "galaxies are continuously funneled into higher density cluster environments through these structures . in the hierarchical structure formation scenario ,",
    "z  @xmath2  0 filaments are the current end point of large - scale structure evolution . investigating filamentary structures around dynamically young clusters should thus yield valuable information on their assembly histories . studying the large - scale galaxy distribution around the virgo cluster , the nearest rich , young cluster ( aguerri et al .",
    "2005 ) , should therefore provide constraints on its formation and evolution at the current epoch .    from three - dimensional mapping of nearby galaxies , tully ( 1982 , hereafter t82 ) identified prolate and oblate over - densities of galaxies around the virgo cluster .",
    "these were however not clearly revealed as conventional narrow filaments , but were rather sparse , mainly due to the limited sample size",
    ". a better characterization of these structures requires improved statistics from larger galaxy samples , particularly those with fainter galaxies .",
    "recent spectroscopic surveys of galaxies such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; e.g. , sdss data release 7 , abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) do enable the exploration of possible filamentary structures within an extensive volume around the virgo cluster .",
    "moreover , radial velocity information on numerous galaxies combined with distance data allows to investigate potential dynamical relationships between the filaments and the virgo cluster .",
    "the primary goal of our study is thus to revisit the large - scale structures in the vicinity of the virgo cluster using an up - to - date statistically robust dataset , to test whether the t82 structures can be better characterized and identified as filaments .",
    "we also search for previously unknown structures that may now be apparent .",
    "finally , we investigate whether the structures are physically connected to the virgo cluster using hubble diagrams . throughout this paper , we assume a hubble constant of @xmath3  = 100  @xmath4  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 , where @xmath4  = 0.74 ( tully et al .",
    "2008 , hereafter t08 ) .",
    "while the sdss is large and homogeneous , it does not cover most of the southern hemisphere and the spectroscopy is incomplete for both bright ( @xmath6  @xmath7 16 ) and faint ( @xmath6  @xmath8 20 ) objects ( e.g. , kim et al .  2014 ) .",
    "we therefore adopt here the hyperleda database ( paturel et al .",
    "2003 ) , which while heterogeneous and necessarily incomplete does contain multiple other surveys in addition to the sdss data release 7 ( abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) .    for our analysis",
    ", we extracted all galaxies with available radial velocities less than 6000  km  s@xmath5 in the region 115  deg  @xmath1 r.a.(j2000 )  @xmath1 240  deg and @xmath935  deg  @xmath1 decl.(j2000 )  @xmath1 60  deg ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "this ensures the inclusion of all structures potentially associated with the virgo cluster ( with a mean radial velocity of @xmath21000  km  s@xmath5 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath2800  km  s@xmath5 ; binggeli et al .",
    "however , as no distinct structure in the vicinity of the virgo cluster is identified beyond a velocity of 3300  km  s@xmath5 , we henceforth only discuss the 9168 galaxies within that range .",
    "we examined the radial velocities of 755 sdss filament galaxies , finding a mean difference of 6  km  s@xmath5 and a dispersion of 63  km  s@xmath5 with respect to hyperleda velocities ( the latter typically averaging multiple surveys ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the radial velocity information of our sample is not significantly affected by the compilation of different sources in hyperleda . to construct an accurate spatial distribution of the galaxies , we first converted the observed heliocentric radial velocities to velocities relative to the centroid of the local group , and then applied a correction for infall into the virgo cluster ( mould et al.2000 ) .",
    "based on the assumption of a linear relationship between redshift and distance , all galaxies were then mapped in the three dimensions of the cartesian supergalactic coordinate system : sgx , sgy , sgz ( t08 ) .",
    "our search for filamentary structures was conducted within the cuboid enclosed by the following limits :    -25  @xmath0  mpc  @xmath1 sgx  @xmath1 25  @xmath0  mpc , + 4  @xmath0  mpc  @xmath1 sgy  @xmath1 27  @xmath0  mpc , + -25  @xmath0  mpc  @xmath1 sgz  @xmath1 25  @xmath0  mpc .",
    "+    the use of this extended region enables a more accurate characterization of large - scale filamentary structures than the study of t82 .",
    "we rejected galaxies within a radius of 3.6  mpc from the virgo cluster center ( at least two times the virial radius ; mclaughlin  1999 ) , to avoid contamination from cluster galaxies with large infall velocities that are gravitationally bound to the cluster inside the infalling region ( mamon et al .",
    "2004 ; falco et al .",
    "this leaves 8401 galaxies with which to search for large - scale structures .",
    "the sgx - sgz plane is best to look for large - scale structures , as positional errors are small in this plane ( roughly in the plane of the sky ) but substantial along the sgy axis ( roughly along the line of sight and thus affected by deviations from the hubble flow ) .",
    "the detection of filaments was thus performed by applying the following steps :    1 .",
    "we constructed a series of different sgx - sgy - sgz volume slices with an arbitrary depth of 2  @xmath0  mpc along the sgy axis .",
    "candidate structures were then selected by visual inspection of the sgx - sgz projection of each slice , looking for overdense and long ( i.e. ,  filamentary ) galaxy distributions . if a candidate structure was continuously present in consecutive slices , we accordingly estimated its full range in three dimensions . 2 .",
    "we performed three - dimensional third - order polynomial fitting with weighting by the local galaxy density to the visually selected candidate structures . if the standard deviation of the fit to a candidate structure was less than 1.5  @xmath0  mpc ( comparable to or less than the typical thickness of filaments in simulations and observations ; e.g.  colberg et al .",
    "2005 ; akahori & ryu 2010 ; choi et al .  2010 ; vazza et al .",
    "2014 ) , the structure was retained and classified as a filament . if not , the candidate structure was rejected .",
    "we further applied a two - sigma clip to the galaxies around the fitted lines ( i.e. ,  the filament spines ) , to extract the galaxies that belong to each filament .",
    "the authenticity of each candidate structure was verified by looking at a multitude of sgx - sgy - sgz projections , and the more diffuse ( i.e. ,  non - filamentary ) nature of the rejected structures was assessed ( chance projections , sheets , etc ) .    with the search strategy above",
    ", we identified seven filaments and one sheet in the volume surrounding the virgo cluster , divided into two subsamples with distinct sgy ranges ( see sec .",
    "figure  1 shows the spatial distribution of the 1013 galaxies belonging to these structures in the equatorial coordinate system .",
    "the properties of these structures are summarized in table  1 .",
    "we note that all structures mostly consist of faint galaxies ( m@xmath1019 ; @xmath288@xmath11 of the total sample ) .    finally , we collected redshift - independent distances of sample galaxies from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , with 229 matches .",
    "we calculated the distances ( @xmath12 ) and radial velocities ( @xmath13 ) of these galaxies relative to the virgo cluster center ( karachentsev & nasonova 2010 ) , adopting a distance of the virgo cluster from us of 16.5  mpc ( mei et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this instance , for the calculation of @xmath13 ( t08 ) , the heliocentric radial velocities were corrected for the motion of the local sheet and local void only ( and _ not _ for virgo - centric infall ) .",
    "finally , peculiar velocities ( @xmath14 ) were derived using the following equation : @xmath15",
    "figure  2 presents the distribution of six filaments with 4  @xmath0  mpc  @xmath1 sgy  @xmath1 16  @xmath0  mpc in the sgx - sgz projected plane ( fig .",
    "2a ) and the sgx - sgy - sgz three - dimensional space ( fig .",
    "we named these filaments after the structures designated as clouds or spurs by t82 ( fig .  2c ) . by construction ,",
    "all the filaments are narrower and longer than the broader and more diffuse t82 structures .",
    "all are also elongated toward the virgo cluster , suggesting they are related to it .",
    "it is interesting to note that when we apply our search strategy to the t82 sample , the t82 structures are _ not _ identified as filaments .",
    "this is most likely due to the small t82 sample size , as the number of galaxies in each filament is two or three times larger in our sample .",
    "in addition , while the majority of galaxies in t82 are bright ( m@xmath2019 ) , our structures are mainly composed of less luminous galaxies ( m@xmath2119 ) . bright galaxies ( large open circles in figs .",
    "14 ) exhibit an uneven distribution with numerous gaps along the filaments .",
    "conversely , the large number of low - luminosity galaxies available here ( small filled circles in figs .",
    "14 ) helps to better delineate continuous filaments by filling in the gaps .",
    "the leo  ii cloud appears to be a multi - stem clump rather than a single prolate one ( fig .",
    "2c ) . indeed , in a more extensive area around the leo  ii cloud , we identified two filaments , leo  ii  a and b. the leo  ii  b filament traces a sparse region of the cloud , whereas the leo  ii  a filament includes the main clump of the leo  ii cloud and is one of the largest structures we detect ( 16  @xmath0  mpc long in the sgx - sgz plane ) , with a curved shape .",
    "it is known that warped or irregular filaments are more common and are on average longer than straight filaments ( colberg et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "over 150 galaxies in the six filaments identified in figs .",
    "2a and 2b have a redshift - independent distance .",
    "their hubble diagram in the virgo - centric reference frame is presented in figure  2d .",
    "most galaxies in all these filaments exhibit a distinct deviation of their radial velocities from an unperturbed hubble flow ( red line ; see also the median values in the inset ) , suggesting appreciable infall toward the virgo cluster .",
    "we also plot a model of the radial infall velocity profile of the virgo cluster ( blue line ) , adopting the model of falco et al .",
    "( 2014 ; eq .  6 , representing the mean velocity of infalling galaxies in the outer regions of the cluster ) with a virial radius of 1.55  mpc ( mclaughlin  1999 ) and a virial velocity of 800  km  s@xmath5 ( binggeli et al .",
    "the observed distribution of radial velocities of the filament galaxies is entirely consistent with the expected infall profile , confirming that all these filaments are dynamically connected to the virgo cluster ( see also karachentsev et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "figures  3a and 3b are analogous to figs .",
    "2a and 2b but for 16  @xmath0  mpc",
    "@xmath1 sgy  @xmath1 27  @xmath0  mpc .",
    "they show one filament and one sheet identified behind the virgo cluster , at mean distances of 33 and 41  mpc from us , respectively .",
    "the filament ( red circles ) , which we call the ngc  5353/4 filament , is long and thin and extends out from the ngc  5353/4 group , running tangentially past the virgo cluster rather than pointing toward it .",
    "filaments running from the vicinity of the ngc  5353/4 group to the virgo ( e.g. , canes venatici filament , see the gray rectangle in fig .",
    "3a ) and coma clusters in different sgy ranges have been reported in the past ( tully @xmath22 trentham 2008 ; pomarde et al .",
    "2015 ) , but the ngc5353/4  filament identified here is not specifically referred to in previous studies .",
    "seventeen galaxies in the ngc  5353/4 filament have a redshift - independent distance . their hubble diagram in the ngc  5353/4 group - centric reference frame",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "all but one ngc  5353/4 filament galaxies show a clear negative offset from the hubble flow , with a mean of @xmath9242  km  s@xmath5 , indicating that they are infalling toward the ngc  5353/4 group .",
    "recently , pomarde et al .  ( 2015 ) identified the arrowhead mini - supercluster , in which the ngc  5353/4 group is located , at the edge of the arrowhead flow pattern in the velocity field .",
    "they also suggested that the ngc  5353/4 group is located at the boundary of the flow pattern of the laniakea supercluster ( tully et al .",
    "the ngc  5353/4 filament thus appears to be a small structure bridging the arrowhead and laniakea superclusters ( see arrows in fig .",
    "3a for the directions to the two superclusters ) .    a thin sheet structure ( yellow circles )",
    "is also clearly visible in figs .",
    "3a and 3b . while it appears filament - like in the projected plane ( fig .",
    "3a ) , it is clearly flattened ( fig .",
    "3b ) , with an axial ratio sgx : sgy : sgz = 9:6:1 . since this structure includes the w and m clouds as well as the western part of the southern extension of the virgo cluster , we name it the w - m sheet .",
    "the existence of this sheet was however alluded to by binggeli et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and a connection between the w and m clouds was also suggested ( e.g.  ftaclas et al.1984 ; yoon et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "fifty four galaxies in the w - m sheet have a redshift - independent distance .",
    "their hubble diagram in the virgo - centric reference frame is presented in fig .",
    "the w - m sheet galaxies have a large scatter around the hubble flow with no trend , indicating that the sheet is unlikely to be dynamically connected to the virgo cluster .",
    "cosmological numerical simulations suggest that galaxy clusters have non - spherical shapes , owing to the preferential infall of matter along the `` cosmic web '' ( e.g.  limousin et al .",
    "2013 and references therein ) .",
    "dynamically young clusters within filaments are also expected to be more elongated than relaxed clusters .",
    "moreover , it has been noted that the virgo cluster exhibits a noticeably non - spherical shape , elongated along a direction almost parallel to the line of sight , albeit primarily when considering galaxies near the cluster center ( e.g.  binggeli et al .",
    "1987 ; west @xmath22 blakeslee 2000 ; mei et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in figure  4a",
    ", we show the spatial distribution of galaxies in the virgo cluster using only galaxies classified as `` certain '' cluster members in the extended virgo cluster catalog ( evcc , kim et al .",
    "2014 ; black open circles inside a large rectangular box ) . using hyperleda",
    ", we also plot the galaxies ( gray open circles ) within the cluster zero - velocity surface ( large gray circle with a 26  deg radius ; karachentsev @xmath22 nasonova 2010 ) .",
    "noticeably , the bright elliptical galaxies ( m@xmath2319 ; red open circles ) are all aligned .",
    "the galaxies in the western outskirts of the cluster ( i.e.,180  deg  @xmath1 r.a .",
    "@xmath1 160  deg ) also exhibit a filamentary distribution , with a major axis similar to that of the bright ellipticals nearer the cluster center .",
    "moreover , this collinear distribution of cluster galaxies appears to be smoothly connected to the leo  ii  a and b filaments identified here ( cyan and green circles ) .",
    "the genuine alignment of the galaxies in three dimensions is confirmed by the distribution of the galaxies with available redshift - independent distances in the plane of r.a .  vs.  distance from us ( fig .",
    "4b ) . instead of a random distribution",
    ", the galaxy distances are systematically increasing from the cluster center to the filaments .",
    "this systematic trend supports the suggestion that the galaxy distribution along the fundamental axis of the virgo cluster is associated with the leo  ii  a and b filaments .",
    "west @xmath22 blakeslee ( 2000 ) claimed that the collinear distribution of the brightest ellipticals near the cluster centre may be part of a filament connecting the virgo cluster to abell  1367 ( see the arrow indicating the direction to abell  1367 in fig .",
    "4b ) , but our data suggest that a connection to the leo  ii  a and b filaments is more likely . in any case , our results are clear observational evidence that the spatial distribution of cluster galaxies is not completely spherically symmetric , reflecting the anisotropy of their accretions along filaments ( e.g.  joachimi et al .  2015 and references therein ; see also lee et al .",
    "2014 ) . in this respect , comparative studies of galaxies in virgo - related filaments with ones in the cluster itself should help to understand the growth and evolution of the cluster ( s.kim , in preparation ) .",
    "filament galaxies are a crucial tool to measure galaxy cluster and group parameters .",
    "we have already estimated a new virgo cluster dynamical mass by applying the novel method of falco et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , based on the universal radial velocity profile of filament galaxies , to the leo  ii  a and virgo  iii filaments ( lee et al .",
    "we have also determined the turn - around radius of the ngc  5353/4  group by applying the falco et al .",
    "methodology to the ngc 5353/4  filament ( lee et al .",
    "accurate measurements of the physical parameters of nearby galaxy clusters and groups using filaments in their vicinity can also provide independent constraints on cosmological models ( see lee et al .  2015a , b for details ) .",
    "finally , filaments are prime targets for detailed investigations of the physical processes controlling the transition of field galaxies to cluster galaxies ( e.g.  balogh et al .  2004 ; ebeling et al .",
    "2004 ; porter et al .",
    "2008 ; yoon et al .  2012 ; guo et al .  2015 ; martnez et al .",
    "indeed , as the majority of filament galaxies are faint dwarf galaxies , with low binding energies , they are easily affected by even weak perturbations .",
    "they are thus well - suited to probing the details of the multiple mechanisms ( e.g.  gas stripping and tidal interactions ) that can affect galaxies in low - density environments before they enter higher - density regions ( `` pre - processing '' ; fujita 2004 ; cybulski et al .",
    "2014 ) . to directly probe environmental effects in filaments",
    ", we are thus currently examining the hi morphology and kinematics of carefully selected late - type galaxies in filaments around the virgo cluster ( e.g.  yoon et al .",
