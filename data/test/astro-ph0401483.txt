    "based on _ hst _ imaging , most studies found evidence for a significant increase ( @xmath2 11.3 magnitude ) in the rest  frame @xmath0-band surface brightness of disk galaxies to @xmath8 , while simard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found no evidence for surface brightness evolution once the selection effects of the survey were taken into account .",
    "the luminosity  size evolution of disks remains a controversial issue and the interpretation of any observed evolution with redshift depends crucially on accounting for the selection biases of the survey ( simard et al . 1999 ; bouwens & silk , 2002 ) .",
    "lilly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) reported that the abundance and size distribution remains constant out to @xmath9 , for the large disks with scalelengths greater than @xmath10 kpc , for which their sample is fairly complete .",
    "the space densities at different look - back times provides a key observable to help determine how and when large galaxies like the milky way were formed .    the multi - wavelength ( @xmath11 ) _ hst_/acs images from goods serve as an excellent resource to examine the size and number density evolution of disk galaxies with redshift .",
    "the availability of a long wavelength baseline from 4300   to 9000   allows galaxy properties to be studied consistently in the rest ",
    "frame @xmath0-band for galaxies out to @xmath1 .",
    "also , the large area of the survey provides an ample number of galaxies over the range @xmath12 for studying the number density evolution .",
    "we adopt the cosmology defined by @xmath13 = 70  mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 throughout this paper .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on the first three epochs of observations of the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) obtained via the goods program .",
    "the sample consists of all sources from the sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) source catalogs of the goods cdf - s region ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) with @xmath17 24.0 magnitude denotes observed ab magnitude in the f850lp filter .",
    "the limiting isophote for the source detection was @xmath2 27.3 magnitude / arcsec@xmath18 in the @xmath19-band . ] and stellarity index @xmath20 0.8 .",
    "these criteria ensure that the signal - to - noise ratio is sufficient for the morphological analysis and excludes the stars .",
    "the photometric redshifts for the galaxies are from mobasher et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and are found to be robust ( @xmath21 ) out to @xmath5 for objects with @xmath17 24.0 magnitude based on the comparison with available spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the final sample consists of 2781 objects with @xmath12 .",
    "we derive the structural parameters of the galaxies through a two - dimensional modelling of the surface brightness distribution using the galfit software ( peng et al .",
    "we use a single srsic ( srsic 1968 ) function to model the brightness profiles , and used simulations to verify that the srsic index , @xmath22 , can provide a reliable classification of the bulge - dominated and disk - dominated galaxies even at the faint magnitudes .",
    "the quality of the best - fit model is judged based on the reduced chi square ( @xmath23 ) value which should be close to unity when the model is a good match to the data .",
    "0.3 cm 0.3 cm the index , @xmath22 , is known to correlate with galaxy morphology ( andredakis , peletier , & balcells 1995 ) . in figure 1",
    ", we illustrate the classification based on @xmath22 , using nearby galaxies from the frei sample ( frei et al .",
    "1996 ) , which have been redshifted artificially to @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the criterion @xmath26 allows us to select disk - dominated galaxies ( sbc - sdm ) even when they have morphological complexities such as dust , star - forming regions , etc .",
    "however , a few late - type galaxies have high @xmath22 due to the presence of a bright nucleus , or circumnuclear star formation in the center and may be missed by our disk selection criterion .",
    "it is encouraging that only few early - type galaxies migrate to the low @xmath22 values , and they usually have large @xmath23 values which implies poor fit to the data .",
    "the structural parameters for the galaxies were measured in the rest - frame @xmath0-band at all redshifts .",
    "when the rest - frame @xmath0-band is redshifted to wavelengths that fall in the gap between two filters , we use an average of the measurements made in the two filters .",
    "we identified 1508 disk galaxies , after excluding about 1% of the galaxies with @xmath27 that have @xmath28 .",
    "based on the spectral type used to assign photometric redshifts , we estimate about 3% contamination from ellipticals and s0 s within our sample of disk galaxies .",
    "we adopt the effective ( or half - light ) radius , @xmath29 , from the srsic fit as a size measure . errors on the measured sizes and magnitudes were estimated using extensive simulations done by introducing `` artificial '' galaxies with exponential disks and @xmath30 bulges into the goods images ( giavalisco et al .",
    "the simulated galaxies have bulge - to - disk ( @xmath31 ) ratios covering the range @xmath32log@xmath33 typical of hubble types sa to sdm ( graham 2001 ) , disk magnitudes @xmath34 , disk half - light radii 0.1 @xmath353.0 , and various ellipticities and position angles .",
    "we find that the systems with @xmath36 are predominantly galaxies with @xmath37 and the bulge does not influence their derived disk parameters significantly . for galaxies with @xmath36 , the mean difference in the integrated magnitudes and half - light radii between the recovered values using the srsic profile and the input disk parameters was @xmath38 mag and @xmath39log@xmath40 with dispersions of @xmath41 and @xmath42log@xmath43 .",
    "* magnitude@xmath44size relation for disk galaxies : * in order to compare the evolution of disks at different redshifts it is important to consider the effect of selection biases which can artificially introduce evolutionary signatures in the absolute magnitude  size ( m@xmath45 ) plane shown in figure 2 . from our simulations we found that the selection in the @xmath19-band is more than 90% complete for disk galaxies with surface brightness , @xmath46 23.4 mag arcsec@xmath18 , measured within the effective radius .",
    "assuming an exponential profile for the disks , this corresponds to a rest ",
    "frame @xmath0-band central surface brightness of @xmath47 20.6 mag arcsec@xmath18 in the highest redshift bin .",
    "the @xmath48 24 magnitude criterion adopted in the sample selection translates to @xmath49 in this redshift bin , and the smallest disk size is @xmath50 kpc .",
    "thus , disk galaxies with @xmath51 , @xmath47 20.6 mag arcsec@xmath18 , and @xmath52 kpc are almost free of selection biases at all redshifts and their distribution in the m@xmath45 plane must reflect the actual luminosity or size evolution .",
    "therefore , only disk galaxies satisfying the above criteria ( _ red points _ in figure 2 ) are considered for further analysis . at redshifts @xmath53 , the surface brightness threshold for 90%",
    "completeness is about a magnitude brighter than the freeman value .",
    "the small number of disks with luminosities @xmath54 in the lowest redshift bin is striking even after accounting for the difference in comoving volumes in the various redshift bins .",
    "there is a class of high surface brightness disks with m@xmath55 and @xmath56 kpc which become dominant at @xmath57 ; a similar observation of high surface brightness disks at @xmath58 was also reported by simard et al .",
    "these objects could be among the most strongly evolving disk population from @xmath5 to the present .    in figure 3",
    "the luminosity function ( lf ) is presented for the `` selection -free '' disk galaxies in all redshift bins along with a representative `` non - evolving '' lf ( de jong & lacey 2000 ) would be ideal , the difference in the sample selection makes such a comparison non - trivial and we defer such a comparison to a future paper . for simplicity",
    ", we adopt the same functional form for the model `` non - evolving '' lf to facilitate a comparison within the goods data set . ] .",
    "our selection criteria restricts the analysis to the most luminous disks and the observed lf at @xmath59 is well  represented by a non - evolving lf over the range of luminosities considered .",
    "however , at @xmath60 , the number of luminous disks with m@xmath61 is marginally higher than expected from the non - evolving lf and the observed points show a relative shift towards higher luminosities",
    ". 0.3 cm 0.3 cm    * size distribution of disk galaxies : * overall , the size distribution ( sd ) for disk galaxies is consistent with a log - normal distribution and there is no noticeable size evolution with redshift within our sample ( figure 4 ) . to examine the effect of the selection and the measurement biases on the observed sd at various redshifts within the sample",
    ", we carried out simulations by inserting `` artificial '' disk galaxies in the goods images ( see  2 ) .",
    "the disk galaxies in the local universe show a log  normal size distribution , and luminosity - size relation , @xmath62 ( de jong & lacey 2000 ) .",
    "we adopt this analytical form and the lf discussed in the previous section , for the input non - evolving luminosity ",
    "size distribution function for galaxies in our simulations . after applying the same selection function to the simulated galaxies as done for observed galaxies , the sizes are re - measured for the `` selection free '' sample . at all redshifts ,",
    "the surface brightness threshold adopted for the selection affects the sd at large radii , and the peak of the distribution shifts to smaller sizes .",
    "the measured sizes are in good agreement with the input sizes in the simulations for @xmath63 , but are biased towards larger sizes at higher redshifts . for the non - evolving model this occurs because galaxies become increasingly fainter at high redshifts and the uncertainties in the background estimation are larger .",
    "thus , for the observed galaxies the sd is not significantly affected by the selection or measurement bias for small disk sizes ( @xmath56 kpc ) at @xmath64 . but",
    "at higher redshifts , given the nature of the measurement bias an evolution in the sd due to the small disks can not be distinguished from the effect of luminosity evolution which can make disks brighter and reduce the bias .",
    "0.3 cm 0.3 cm    * number densities of disk galaxies : * the observed number density of disk galaxies ( figure 5 ) that are free of selection biases in the goods cdf - s field , is found to remain almost unchanged out to redshift of @xmath65 within the uncertainties .",
    "we divided the sample into small disks ( @xmath56 kpc ) and large disks ( @xmath66 kpc ) to look for differences in their relative abundances .",
    "neither sample shows strong evolution within the uncertainties , except for a mild increase in the number of small disks at @xmath67 . assuming that the evolution in number density can be expressed in the form , @xmath68",
    ", a formal linear regression analysis gives @xmath69 = 0.08@xmath700.23 for all disks , and @xmath69 = 0.00@xmath700.27 and 0.20@xmath700.39 for the small and large disks respectively . in all cases ,",
    "the best fit favors an almost constant number density over the whole redshift range .",
    "however , a factor of four change in the number densities of small disks can not be ruled out within the 2@xmath4 uncertainties of the obtained fits .",
    "the same is true for the large disks if we exclude the lowest redshift bin where the uncertainty is large .",
    "thus , ignoring the possible effects of luminosity evolution at @xmath71 , it appears that the population of disk galaxies could have undergone only very modest evolution in their number densities from @xmath72 to @xmath65 .",
    "in order to check for contamination from bulge - dominated galaxies that scatter into the sample at faint magnitudes we re - did the analysis using only those galaxies with @xmath73 , which have negligible bulge component and obtained very similar results .    0.3 cm 0.3 cm",
    "in the context of evolution of disk galaxies in the m@xmath45 plane , it is important to investigate the effects of @xmath0-band surface brightness increase by @xmath2 1.1@xmath441.5 mag out to @xmath5 , claimed by some studies and contradicted by others ( see  1 ) . to allow direct comparisons at different redshifts within the goods data",
    ", we confined our analysis to galaxies with @xmath51 and @xmath74 mag arcsec@xmath18 , such that they are not affected by selection biases in any redshift .",
    "for this sample , we do not see any significant evolution in the mean @xmath0-band surface brightness ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "these results are in agreement with simard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) who apply a uniform selection function from the highest to lowest redshift bins .",
    "in contrast , the strong surface brightness evolution seen by bouwens & silk ( 2002 ) is based on their comparison of samples that span different ranges of luminosity and surface brightness at different redshifts .",
    "if we include all the disks in our data within the apparent magnitude and surface - brightness limits for 90% completeness in the @xmath19-band , we find an increase in the mean @xmath0-band surface brightness by @xmath76 mags from @xmath77 to @xmath8 .",
    "such a selection made based on apparent magnitude and size translates to different surface brightness thresholds in the intrinsic @xmath6 plane at different redshifts .",
    "for example , at low redshifts ( @xmath78 ) most of the disk galaxies chosen based on the above criteria have average @xmath79 close to the freeman value , while at higher redshifts the average @xmath79 for the selected disks shifts to brighter magnitudes .",
    "the interpretation of the results in this case would thus depend on comparison to disk evolution models ; alternatively a comparison can be made using like samples at different redshifts which is the approach used here .",
    "the size distribution of disks over the redshifts @xmath80 is found to remain unchanged and exhibits a log  normal behavior similar to disk galaxies at low redshifts ( de jong & lacey 2000 ; shen et al .",
    "this also agrees with the expectations from the hierarchical models of disk formation ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ) .",
    "however , we note that the observed peak , and shape of the sd at large @xmath29 may be partly affected by the surface brightness threshold ( figure 2 ) that defines the selection .",
    "the evolution of the observed sd at @xmath71 within the goods sample either due to a mild increase in the number of small - sized disks ( @xmath56 kpc ) or luminosity evolution which makes the disks appear brighter at higher redshifts , can not be distinguished given the measurement biases .",
    "also , the scatter of bulge - dominated systems into the sample can lead to a similar effect and may pose a challenge to using the simple @xmath36 criteria for disk galaxy classification at high redshifts .    from the observed number densities and luminosity - size distributions ,",
    "we conclude that the population of luminous ( m@xmath81 ) , disk galaxies with the sizes ranging from 0.8@xmath4410 kpc were present with roughly the same abundance at @xmath8 as at low redshifts ( @xmath82 ) and are likely to have undergone only a modest luminosity evolution .",
    "this would require a formation epoch earlier than @xmath8 for these galaxies . albeit based on a small number of galaxies , it is interesting that there is evidence for large disks at a mean redshift of @xmath83 ( labb et al .",
    "2003 ) with roughly the same abundance as seen for the large disks at @xmath5 in our data .",
    "whether this implies that massive systems like the milky way galaxy were already in place at that epoch can be addressed with additional kinematic information to constrain the mass  to  light ratios . a more detailed analysis based on the full goods data",
    "will be presented in a future paper .",
