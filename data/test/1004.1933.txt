    "physics enters biology in two broad and overlapping areas  information and mechanics @xcite .",
    "this review is about the mechanics , statistical and otherwise , of living matter .",
    "this is not a review of soft - matter physics in a biological setting .",
    "the aspect of biological matter of interest here is the ability to transduce free energy into systematic movement .",
    "this property is the defining characteristic of active matter , and my interest is in the unique mechanical properties that arise as a consequence of such active processes @xcite .",
    "this review focusses on the collective behaviour of systems with a large number of constituents , and will thus use the ideas of condensed matter and statistical physics .",
    "i will not discuss the physics of molecular motors or the related and vast exclusion - process family of problems @xcite .",
    "the aim is to complement and update the perspectives of earlier reviews @xcite and to present the achievements and limitations of this rapidly advancing subfield .",
    "i begin with the realizations of active matter to be covered .",
    "it is natural for a condensed matter physicist to regard a coherently moving flock of birds , beasts or bacteria as an orientationally ordered phase of living matter .",
    "this idea was first implemented @xcite in computer models of interacting particles moving with a fixed speed and trying to align their velocity vectors parallel to those of their neighbours , in the presence of noise . to a student of magnetism",
    "these are itinerant , classical , ferromagnetically interacting continuous spins that move in the direction in which they point , which is what makes flocks different from magnets .",
    "the models showed a nonequilibrium phase transition from a disordered state to a flock with long - range order @xcite in the particle velocities as the noise strength was decreased or the concentration of particles raised .",
    "the nature of order and fluctuations in a flock , the character of the transition to a flock , and the flocking of active particles with an axis but no polarity are among the issues this review deals with .",
    "amazingly , the physics of flocking can be imitated by a collection of rods lying on a horizontal surface , agitated vertically @xcite",
    ". indeed , vibrated monolayers of macroscopic grains have provided some of the most fruitful realizations of active matter .",
    "this review will explain briefly the physics behind underlying this analogy and highlight experiments that exploit it @xcite    flocking in a fluid medium introduces physics absent in the simplest flocking models : each swimming creature generates fluid flow which moves and reorients other swimmers far away . including this interaction leads @xcite to a modified liquid - crystal hydrodynamics @xcite , in which the constituent particles carry permanent stresses that stir the fluid .",
    "the implications of this interplay of self - propelling activity and fluid flow for order and macroscopic rheology are an important part of this review .",
    "the physics of the flocking of organisms in a fluid reappears at a _ _ sub__cellular scale in the cytoskeleton @xcite , the polymeric scaffolding that governs transport , adhesion , movement and division in the living cell .",
    "two nonequilibrium processes drive the cytoskeleton : the atp - assisted polymerization and depolymerization known as _ treadmilling _",
    ", which i will not discuss ; and _ contractility _ , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ contractfig ] , which arises from the atp - driven movement of motor proteins in specific directions on biofilaments , and is central to this review .",
    "the cytoskeleton is thus a suspension of filaments endowed with active internal forces .",
    "moreover , there are natural mechanisms that promote the alignment of neighbouring filaments , through excluded volume as well as activity .",
    "we must therefore allow for the possibility of orientational order .",
    "it is then not surprising that the hydrodynamic equations obtained in the active - gel description @xcite of the cytoskeleton have precisely the same form as those @xcite for collections of swimming organisms , ignoring complications such as permanent crosslinking .",
    "a condensed - matter physicist accustomed to symmetry arguments should find it reassuring that identical hydrodynamic descriptions apply for a @xmath0 km fish shoal and a @xmath0 @xmath1 m cytoskeleton .",
    "the viewpoint of this review is that living matter can fruitfully be regarded as a kind of material @xcite and studied using the tools of condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics ; that there is a practical way to encode into such a description those features of the living state that are relevant to materials science ; and that the results of such an endeavour will help us better understand , control and perhaps mimic active cellular matter .",
    "a community of respectable size has grown around this activity , approaching the problem at different length scales and with a variety of techniques .",
    "what do they , and we , hope to gain from this enterprise ?",
    "first , active matter is condensed matter in a fundamentally new nonequilibrium regime : ( i ) the energy input takes place directly at the scale of each active particle , and is thus homogeneously distributed through the bulk of the system , unlike sheared fluids or three - dimensional _ bulk _ granular matter , where the forcing is applied at the boundaries .",
    "( ii ) self - propelled motion , unlike sedimentation , is force - free : the forces that particle and fluid exert on each other cancel .",
    "( iii ) the direction of self - propelled motion is set by the orientation of the particle itself , not fixed by an external field .",
    "indeed , these can be taken as the practical defining properties of active matter .",
    "a comprehensive theory of this ubiquitous type of condensed matter is a natural imperative for the physicist , and should yield a catalogue of the generic behaviours , such as nonequilibrium phases and phase transitions , the nature of correlations and response , and characteristic instabilities .",
    "second , therefore , the generic tendencies emerging from the theory of active matter , unless suppressed by specific mechanisms , must arise in vivo , which is why biologists should care about it .",
    "last , if we can understand active matter , perhaps we can manufacture faithful imitations of it in chemomechanical systems without components of biological origin @xcite    the reader should keep in mind that theories of active matter were formulated not in response to a specific puzzle posed by experiments but rather to incorporate living , metabolizing , spontaneously moving matter into the condensed - matter fold .",
    "this was done through minimal models whose consequences are relatively easy for theoreticians to work out .",
    "natural realizations of living matter are far from minimal , so comparisons of active - matter theory with experiment are likely to be qualitative until well - controlled model systems are devised .",
    "although this is not a historical review , it must be stated here that the active - matter idea is not new . in a prescient article , finlayson and",
    "scriven @xcite argued that biological matter could display hydrodynamic instabilities driven by stresses arising from metabolic activity in the bulk of a fluid . unlike in this review",
    ", they build active stress - tensor contributions from gradients of existing scalars such as concentration and temperature .",
    "they point out that the field poses `` challenges to theoretical rheology '' and is `` virgin territory for experimental research in the physics of complex fluids '' .",
    "they conclude that `` continuum .. analysis ... of instability by active stress is probably .... destined to play a large part in understanding some of the engines operating at the cellular level in living systems '' .",
    "the developments surveyed in this article prove them right .",
    "the body of this review consists of several sections each treating a specific example of an active - matter system . in section [ drypolar ]",
    "the simplest models of moving flocks , without solvent flow , are introduced and some key properties discussed .",
    "flocks without macroscopic polarity and hence no migration velocity are surveyed in section [ dryapolar ] . the theoretical framework for collective self - propulsion in a fluid medium",
    "is found in section [ activesusp ] , with a discussion of general symmetry - based approaches , and the active mechanics of the cytoskeleton in section [ cytohydro ] .",
    "non - biological self - driven particles are the subject of section [ artificial ] .",
    "the article closes with section [ outlook ] which summarizes the achievements and limitations of the approach adopted here to the modelling of active matter and attempts to set a course for future experiments and theory in this vital and rapidly evolving field .",
    "arrows are _ polar _ objects , uniform cylinders are _ apolar_. a flock moving in one direction has polar order , whereas equal numbers of ants moving from south to north and from north to south are macrscopically apolar even though the individual ants are polar .",
    "we begin by discussing polar ordered states .      in the simplest models @xcite of ordering transitions of active particles ,",
    "the medium through which the particles move is treated as an inert substrate .",
    "each particle carries a velocity vector of fixed magnitude , which it rotates to point parallel to the mean of its neighbours velocities , with an angular tolerance @xmath2 .",
    "it then takes a small step in the direction of the updated vector . like the continuous - spin magnets that they resemble , the vicsek family of models display a well - defined phase transition from a disordered phase to a coherent flock as @xmath3",
    "is decreased or the number density is increased @xcite . _",

    "a coarse - grained dynamical description works with `` slow variables '' @xcite , whose relaxation times increase unboundedly with increasing wavelength . for the vicsek model these are @xcite the number density field @xmath4 , since total number is conserved , and the velocity field @xmath5 , whose fluctuations transverse to the mean ordering direction are the spin - waves or nambu - goldstone @xcite modes of the flock @xcite . with the slow variables in hand , toner and tu",
    "@xcite write down the equations of motion , incorporating the physics of the vicsek model , on general grounds of symmetry .",
    "first , the dynamics of @xmath5 is described in the equation below : [ vecop ] _ t * p * + + ... = ( - ) * p * + - p(c ) + * f * ignoring all gradients in equation [ vecop ] , a phase transition from the isotropic state @xmath6 to an ordered flock with @xmath7 , spontaneously breaking rotation invariance , should occur as the control parameter @xmath8 is tuned from negative to sufficiently large positive values ; @xmath9 , in general a tensor , controls the elastic @xcite restoring forces to distortions in the ordered phase .",
    "the random error @xmath2 of the vicsek update rule is summarized in a nonconserving , gaussian noise @xmath10 , uncorrelated in space and time . the crucial difference from traditional models of dynamic critical phenomena",
    "@xcite lies in the navier - stokes - like @xmath11 term @xcite , which says that distortions in @xmath5 are advected by @xmath5 , because @xmath5 is not only an order parameter but a velocity .",
    "@xmath12 , a general increasing function of concentration , then embodies the equation of state for the pressure .",
    "second , c evolves through the continuity equation [ conteqgen ] _ t c + c * p * = 0 , because @xmath13 is the velocity field of the particles .",
    "equations [ vecop ] and [ conteqgen ] can be viewed as the dynamics of a fluid with a preferred speed relative to a background medium , or of a magnet whose spin is a velocity . in the second interpretation ,",
    "the nonequilibrium character of the toner - tu model enters only through the advective @xmath11 term in equation [ vecop ] and the current in equation [ conteqgen ] .",
    "the right - hand side of equation [ vecop ] can be written as @xmath14 plus noise , with a free - energy functional [ polarfree ] f[*p * ] = d^dr [ -2*p * + 4 ( * p * ) ^2 + 2 + * p * p(c ) ] .",
    "of ginzburg - landau form , in which the `` pressure gradient '' @xmath15 appears as an orienting field for @xmath5 . in the absence of @xmath11 ,",
    "the average dynamics is downhill in @xmath16 .",
    "a flock governed by equations [ vecop]-[polarfree ] is a strange blend of magnet and fluid .",
    "let us rediscover some of its unique properties @xcite , all consequences of the fact that the order parameter is itself a velocity .      _ sound modes _",
    ": let us linearize equations [ vecop ] , [ conteqgen ] about a uniform ordered state with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , denote directions along and transverse to @xmath20 by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and see how small disturbances @xmath23 , @xmath24 travel . as in heisenberg or xy magnets @xcite , we can see from equation [ vecop ] that @xmath25 relaxes rapidly , so that on long timescales @xmath26 .",
    "if we take @xmath27 in equation [ vecop ] , a shift to a frame moving with speed @xmath28 eliminates advective terms from equations [ vecop ] and [ conteqgen ] in this linearized analysis without losing the essential physics . to leading order in gradients , and ignoring the noise , equations",
    "[ vecop ] and [ conteqgen ] then become [ conceomflock ] _ t c = - c_0 _ _ , [ poleomflock ] _ t _",
    "= -p(c_0 ) _ c leading to propagating modes with frequency [ flockdisp ] = q _ at wavevector @xmath29 .",
    "no , we havent rediscovered normal sound waves .",
    "long - wavelength sound in a fluid propagates because of momentum conservation , which a flock lacks .",
    "the `` sound modes '' in a flock are a consequence of spontaneously broken rotation invariance : they propagate at long wavelength because @xmath30 is not damped at zeroth order in wavenumber .    _ giant number fluctuations _ : @xmath30 is the nambu - goldstone mode @xcite of broken rotation invariance , easily excited and slow to decay at small wavenumber @xmath31 .",
    "hence when noise is included the steady - state variance @xmath32 of the @xmath31th fourier component should diverge at small wavenumber @xmath31 , like spin waves in an xy magnet @xcite or director fluctuations in a nematic @xcite . but",
    "equations [ conceomflock]-[poleomflock ] imply that , for frequencies and wavenumbers related by equation [ flockdisp ] , @xmath33",
    ". therefore , the variance of @xmath23 should also diverge at small @xmath31 . in real space",
    "this means that for regions with @xmath34 particles on average , the variance in the number grows faster than @xmath34 : a flock should display giant number fluctuations .    _",
    "long - range order in @xmath17 _ : equations [ vecop ] and [ conteqgen ] when linearized yield @xmath35 . taken",
    "literally this would mean only quasi - long - range order in dimension @xmath36 , by analogy with the xy model .",
    "however , nonlinearities in equations [ vecop ] and [ conceomflock ] are stongly relevant in @xmath36",
    ". and lead to @xmath32 diverging more slowly than @xmath37 for most directions of @xmath38 , thus preserving long - range order @xcite . here is a qualitative explanation of how this happens . consider a flock with @xmath39 at a given instant . because @xmath5 is a velocity , a long wavelength fluctuation",
    "@xmath30 will allow creatures in the flock to exert their orienting influence on regions out to a distance @xmath40 in a time @xmath41 .",
    "this effective enhancement of the range of influence ultimately leads @xcite to a suppression of orientational fluctuations on large scales , and thus to long - range order in @xmath36 .",
    "the effect is absent in @xmath42 , where rotations are a discrete symmetry and there _ is _ no @xmath30 .",
    "we will return to this point in section [ 1dflocks ] .",
    "i have not discussed microscopic derivations of the toner - tu equations @xcite , dynamics near the onset of polar ordering @xcite , and the application of flocking models @xcite to motor - microtubule extracts @xcite .",
    "two types of tests of the physicist s approach to flocking are required .",
    "experiments on real flocks are of course the real test .",
    "however , it is equally important to check the predictions of coarse - grained theories against computer experiments on microscopic models .",
    "we discuss both below , although measurements of the phase - transition variety on real flocks are scarce .      quantitative agreement has been found between numerical `` experiments '' on microscopic models and the predictions of the coarse - grained theory , including long - range order in @xmath36 , the form of the propagating modes , anomalous density fluctuations and superdiffusion of tagged particles @xcite .",
    "i am not aware of any laboratory or field - based attempts to measure ordered - phase correlation functions for flocks on a substrate .      although some studies @xcite claim to see a continuous onset of the ordered phase , as a mean - field treatment of equation [ vecop ] or analogy to continuous - spin magnets would suggest , very large - scale numerical studies of the vicsek model and its relatives show that the transition is in general a discontinuous one , characterized by a complicated coexistence @xcite . see also ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in numerical studies of the vicsek model in one space dimension , long domains of coherently moving particles do appear at low noise and high density .",
    "it is occasionally claimed @xcite that this is a true phase transition in the limit of infinite system size , as occurs in vicsek models in dimension @xmath43 .",
    "recall that the @xmath44 ising model fails to order because of the proliferation of kinks @xcite .",
    "does some magic suppress kinks , i.e. , velocity flips , in @xmath44 flocks ?",
    "raymond and evans @xcite estimate the lifetime @xmath45 of a @xmath44 flock of length @xmath46 as the mean time for the appearance of a kink .",
    "they show that if @xmath45 is to grow at least as a power of @xmath46 , the number of particles per site must grow , artificially , at least as @xmath47 .",
    "accepting the constraint of a finite number density yields a finite lifetime and correlation length for the would - be flock .",
    "ultimately , nothing saves @xmath44 flocks from the fate of the @xmath44 ising model because flocking in @xmath44 breaks a _",
    "discrete _ symmetry and is thus not accompanied by nambu - goldstone modes whose long range is responsible for the rescue act in @xmath36 .    nevertheless , lowering the noise strength or raising the density at fixed @xmath46 will eventually yield a system with correlation length larger than @xmath46 , and a bistable time - series of the flocking order parameter , i.e. , a finite transient flock with a large lifetime . precisely this phenomenon has been seen in experiments , to which we turn next .      1 .",
    "couzin @xcite studies the one - dimensional flocking of desert locusts on an annular track .",
    "the onset of coherent motion seen in the experiments as the number of locusts is increased , and the bistable time - series switching between clockwise and counterclockwise circuits of the track are well described by the @xmath44 vicsek model @xcite , to which the paper makes a comparison .",
    "one must not of course conclude  see reference @xcite and section [ 1dflocks ]  that there is a true phase transition here .",
    "all the same , the experiment demonstrates convincingly the relevance of simple flocking models to an understanding the behaviour of real organisms .",
    "szab @xcite created a polar flock in a petri dish by using motile keratocytes extracted from fish scales .",
    "as the cells divide and the areal density of cells crosses a threshold , there is a well - defined onset of a state of macroscopic order in the orientations and velocities of the keratocytes , that can plausibly be interpreted as a flocking phase transition , which should be governed by the local physics of the models we have been discussing , as the cells interact only by contact .",
    "the data quality makes it impossible to draw conclusions regarding the order of the transition .",
    "the authors make further inferences on the transition from a computational model , not from data . despite limitations",
    "the experiment is valuable as a realization of the flocking transition , with potential for higher - precision studies including finite - size scaling .",
    "there is a surprising link between vibrated granular monolayers and self - propulsion @xcite .",
    "polar rods @xcite , placed on a vertically vibrated horizontal linear track , move on average with small end forward .",
    "systematic unidirectional motion of apolar rods @xcite was effected by maintaining them permanently tilted , by overfilling an annular channel with rods .",
    "the propulsion mechanism @xcite is illustrated in the cartoon fig .",
    "[ shakenrod ] .",
    "+ + the reader is encouraged to check that this system satisfies all three defining properties of active matter in section [ activematerialsub ] . published studies so far @xcite of polar rods at high coverage on a vibrated surface report order and anomalous density fluctuations on a local scale , and an abrupt flight to the boundary when the vibration amplitude crosses a threshold , but not a macroscopically ordered flock .",
    "the case of apolar rods @xcite is discussed in section [ subsub : dryapolarexps ] .",
    "at least one example is known @xcite of living , pulsating elongated cells forming a state with spontaneous , uniaxial orientational order with a macroscopic axis @xmath48 with @xmath49 symmetry .",
    "this is the spatial symmetry of nematic liquid crystals , and it guarantees that the mean macroscopic velocity of such a `` flock '' is zero . and yet active nematics are profoundly different from dead ones . in particular , here as in polar flocks , giant number fluctuations are predicted @xcite  even though the order parameter for the nematic is _ not _ a velocity .",
    "below is an explanation of how it works .    in the presence of noise , long wavelength fluctuations of the axis of orientation ",
    "the broken - symmetry mode  are abundant . working in two dimensions for simplicity , where distortions are described by a single angle @xmath50 ,",
    "we see ( fig . [ curvcurrfig ] ) that bend or splay produces a _ polar _ configuration .",
    "the absence of time - reversal invariance in a driven state , together with the polarity , means @xcite that particles in the curved region must drift in a direction defined by the curvature as pictured in fig .",
    "[ curvcurrfig ] , leading to a current of particles @xmath51 with @xmath52 in two dimensions . in steady state , this active flux must be balanced on average by restoring diffusive currents @xmath53 .",
    "thus fluctuations in @xmath4 and @xmath50 must be of the same order .",
    "orientational fluctuations , being a broken - symmetry mode , should have a variance of order @xmath54 at wavenumber @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , number density fluctuations @xmath55 as well which means the number fluctuations in regions containing @xmath34 particles on average have a standard deviation [ gnf ] n n^1/2 + 1/d ~n d = 2 for large @xmath34 .",
    "unlike for polar flocks @xcite , these results of the linearized theory for apolar systems survive _ quantitatively _ when nonlinearities are included @xcite .        the first test of the existence of giant number fluctuations ( gnfs ) in active nematics was a computer experiment on a clever apolar generalization @xcite of the two - dimensional vicsek model described in section [ vicsekmodel ] .",
    "each particle is assigned an _ axis _ , rather than a unit vector , which it aligns parallel to the mean of its neighbours axes , subject to a small angular noise .",
    "the particle then takes a small step preferentially along the axis , forward or back .",
    "since the orientation variable and the moves are all defined modulo @xmath56 , the model has no polarity . as noise or mean interparticle separation",
    "is decreased , a continuous transition is seen from an isotropic state to a phase with quasilong - range nematic order of the particle axes as in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "however , the density fluctuations are giant : @xmath57 grew far more rapidly than @xmath34 and could be fitted to a form @xmath58 in precise agreement with the predictions @xcite whose derivation was sketched above .",
    "real - space snapshots showed strong transient inhomogeneity , with a banded structure . if the anisotropic , detailed - balance - violating move is replaced by an isotropically distributed random step , the nematic phase survives , but with normal number fluctuations , because detailed balance now holds . s. mishra @xcite has shown that coarse - graining the model of chat @xcite yields the equations of motion of ref .",
    "@xcite , with the active current as in section [ activecurr ] .",

    "the resulting @xmath17 nematic phase has large regions of oriented cells with occasional point topological defects of strength @xmath59 which reinforce the nematic interpretation @xcite .",
    "although the authors of @xcite emphasize that their systems are very far from thermal equilibrium the analysis they bring to bear on the problem , especially in the apolar case , is largely inherited from the equilibrium theory of liquid crystals .",
    "the focus in @xcite is on modelling cell orientations , in a population - averaged description which can not resolve spatial variations in the density .",
    "consistent with this limitation , their experiments do not look at the behaviour of density fluctuations .",

    "kruse and jlicher @xcite , motivated by actomyosin phenomena , studied active stresses in one - dimensional microscopic models of motors and filament bundles . in an important series of papers , liverpool , marchetti and collaborators @xcite have carried out a systematic construction of the coarse - grained equations of motion of active filaments , for systems on a substrate as well as in bulk suspension , starting from a microscopic description of motors gripping filaments and moving along them .",
    "they obtain equations of the form proposed by purely phenomenological theories @xcite , but each parameter in the coarse - grained theories is traced to a microscopic process involving motors and filaments .",
    "an important outcome @xcite is phase diagrams including the various well - known instabilities of actin solutions such as bundling , with a connection to experimentally accessible control parameters such as filament concentration and strength of motor activity .",
    "the initial approach was motivated by cytoskeletal physics , but more recently @xcite the focus has been on swimmers .",
    "the prediction @xcite that activity alters the viscosity of suspensions , as discussed in section [ activesusp ] , has recently been tested by rafa @xcite on the motile alga chlamydomonas , a contractile swimmer , in a conventional rheometer , and by sokolov and aranson @xcite on the bacterium bacillus subtilis , an extensile swimmer , by monitoring the decay of an imposed vortex as well as by measuring the viscous torque on a rotating particle .",

    "the viscosity was suppressed by as much as a factor of 7 in some cases .",
    "these experiments not only confirm the predictions of hatwalne @xcite but also provide strong support for the idea that a medium suffused with active processes such as swimming should be thought of as a distinct type of material .",
    "there is ample qualitative evidence of the instability of active ordered suspensions predicted in reference @xcite and discussed in section [ instabsec ] .",
    "it would appear that collections of bacteria ca nt swim straight even if they set out to do so @xcite , and that their own active stresses are responsible .",

    "a remarkable underwater acoustic measurement @xcite of the static structure factor of the number density of fish shoals , for wavenumbers from @xmath99 to @xmath100 m@xmath101 reveals a power law @xmath102 , and a rapid wavelike response of fish to perturbations , both of which are consistent with the toner - tu @xcite work described above .",
    "however , to deal with the fact that the fish are in water , a more complete theory of active suspensions at high reynolds number , or at least in the unsteady - stokes description , is clearly needed .",
    "power counting on equation [ nsactive ] shows that nonlinearities are relevant in dimension @xmath103 . an actual renormalization - group calculation for this problem",
    "is even more daunting than that for the toner - tu model @xcite and therefore has not been done .",
    "a useful first step would be a comparison of the fish - shoal observations @xcite to the unsteady - stokes predictions @xcite discussed under `` fish schools '' in section [ activesusp ] .",

    "the study of self - propelled liquid drops on a surface , a common sight on a hot skillet in the kitchen , is a subfield in itself and can not be reviewed in any detail here .",
    "the driving force is generally evaporation of one or more constituents from the liquid .",
    "a couple of recent examples are the work of thakur @xcite on nematic drops and chen @xcite on oil drops driven by surface tension gradients .",
    "it should also be possible to make motors by forcing asymmetric elastic dimers with nonequilibrium noise @xcite .",
    "an intriguing new theoretical development holds out the possibility of using mechanical agitation to make stokesian swimmers from collections of elastic dimers @xcite . in all these cases a well - known general principle @xcite seems to work : polarity together with sustained dissipation leads to motility .",
    "what has the active - matter effort achieved ?",
    "it has opened a new area of fundamental physics  the hydrodynamics of liquid crystals and suspensions in an entirely novel regime .",
    "it is part of a larger process : biology is increasingly concerned with the mechanical forces exerted in living systems , and the active - matter approach provides the framework in which to ask these questions .",
    "it has made specific predictions , and experimenters are managing to check some of them .",
    "the impact on biology is already being felt , from the subcellular scale to starling flocks @xcite . in cell biology ,",
    "tissue is clearly the next mountain , and some steps on it have already been taken @xcite .",
    "the active hydrodynamic framework , suitably adapted , should apply to self - driven particles in more complex media and geometries @xcite .",
    "the approach to active matter advocated in this review shares an important weakness with all coarse - grained theories : an abundance of phenomenological parameters . if thermal brownian motion and active processes are present in comparable magnitude",
    ", a clear distinction can probably be made between parameters determined primarily by equilibrium physics and arising strictly from activity .",
    "however this nice separation is lost if noise and coefficients themselves are functions of activity @xcite , as they probably are in bacteria and certainly are in granular matter .",
    "this limits somewhat the predictive power of coarse - grained theories .",
    "this is a limitation we re used to in equilibrium physics : ginzburg - landau free - energy functionals predict temperature dependences best near continuous phase transitions , not over an entire phase .",
    "in addition , living systems are finite in space and time and thus not ideally suited for gradient - expanded approaches",
    ". we must admit these limitations and accept humbly the need for microscopic theories .",
    "there are two imperatives if the field is to make a real contribution to biology .",
    "future theory work must aim to integrate the combined effects of growth , cross - linking , treadmilling , multiple species of filament , and the coupling of the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane @xcite .",
    "future experimental work must aim for quantitative tests of existing predictions of active - hydrodynamics , on controlled experimental systems .",
