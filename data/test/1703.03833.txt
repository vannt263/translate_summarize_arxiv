    "3a , it is clear that although frequency values vary substantially while sweeping angle , they correspond to one of the five identified orbits . the angular dependence of peak frequency can be used to model the shape of the fermi surface@xcite . in the case of feas ,",

    "the top figure uses the original fermi level proposed by parker and mazin@xcite , while the bottom one is from the same calculation but with the fermi level raised by 55 mev .",
    "this shift changes the size of the pockets , but their shapes and locations are not significantly altered , establishing the resiliency of this fermi surface arrangement and the expected angular dependence of each pocket .",

    "both have a generally ellipsoidal shape , in agreement with what can be inferred from quantum oscillations data for most directions .",
    "theoretical quantum oscillation frequencies were generated from the dft calculations using the skeaf program@xcite and plotted together with the experimental data in fig .",
    "two bands , one electron - like and one hole - like , were expected for each plane of field rotation , giving a 1:1 correspondence to what was obtained in measurements .",
    "based on expected frequencies and angular dependence we identify the @xmath31 and @xmath32 peaks as hole pocket oscillations , with @xmath33 and @xmath24 belonging to the electron band . increasing the fermi level does not change the angular dependence , but the change in pocket size does seem to give closer agreement to the observed oscillation frequencies , which are proportional to the cross sectional orbital area . for",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath17 expected angular dependence matches well to data , and in fact the splitting seen in the hole band is also present from the unshifted fermi surface calculation over a range of angles . for @xmath21",
    "the divergence at high angles does not happen in the theory , where frequency has a much smaller expected increase .",
    "additionally , for @xmath23 the angular dependence of the sine wave is reversed .",
    "this indicates that the electron pocket is larger in the k@xmath34k@xmath35 plane than in the k@xmath36k@xmath35 plane , while the band structure predicts the opposite .",
    "overall the dft fermi surface appears accurate for measurements in which field was rotated between _ a _ and _ c _ , but not _ a _ and _ b_. again we note that k@xmath34 corresponds to the propagation direction of the sdw , while the moments lie in the k@xmath36k@xmath35 plane .",
    "the fact that this is also the field direction for which we see the strongest divergence from calculation indicates that disagreement between dft and experiment in terms of magnetic ordering may be related to disagreement about band structure .",
    "data do , however , support the two carrier model put forth by other groups .",

    "the hole pocket has a much more dramatic angular dependence , and for a small range of angles near * h * @xmath7 _ b _ even exceeds the electron value .",

    "the oscillation is not observed for * h *  @xmath7  _ c _ , but for * h *  @xmath7  _ b _ it increases substantially to 39  nm@xmath46 or 33% of the fermi surface , further evidence for large angular dependence in the hole band .",
