    "the crab pulsar has been monitored continuously for decades years by various telescopes since it was discovered in 1968 ( lyne et al .",
    "1993 ; lyne et al . 2015 ; wang et al .",
    "its braking index is @xmath5 ( lyne et al .",

    "long - term observations have found that almost all pulsars ( except accreting x - ray pulsars in binary systems ) are spinning down .",
    "the spin - down behavior can be described by a power law ( lyne et al .",
    "1993 ) : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is usually taken as a constant and @xmath11 is the braking index .",
    "the braking index and second braking index are defined respectively ( livingstone et al . 2005 ) : @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the pulsar spin frequency , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the first , second and third frequency derivative , respectively . the spinning down of pulsars is usually assumed to be braked by the magnetic dipole radiation ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) . in the magnetic dipole radiation model ,",
    "a neutron star rotates uniformly in vacuo at a frequency @xmath14 and possesses a magnetic moment @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding slowdown rate is : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the magnetic dipole moment ( @xmath21 is the polar magnetic field and @xmath22 is the radius of neutron star ) , @xmath23 is the moment of inertia , @xmath24 is the speed of light , and @xmath25 is the angle between the rotational axis and the magnetic axis ( i.e. , the inclination angle ) .",
    "the spin down behavior of pulsar in this model can be described as @xmath26 .",
    "the braking index is exactly three if @xmath27 , and @xmath25 are constant . to date ,",
    "only eight pulsars , including the crab pulsar , have measured the meaningful braking indices for they are young and own relatively larger @xmath15 ( espinoza et al .",
    "2011 ; lyne et al .",
    "their braking indices are all smaller than three .",
    "it means that there are other physical processes needed to slow down the pulsar .",
    "many mechanisms have been proposed in order to explain the braking index observations , e.g. , the pulsar wind model ( xu & qiao 2001 ; wu et al .",
    "2003 ; contopoulos & spitkovsky 2006 ; yue et al .",
    "2007 ) , a changing magnetic field strength ( lin et al . 2004 ; chen & li 2006 ; espinoza et al . 2011 ) , a changing inclination angle ( lyne et al . 2013 ) , and additional torques due to accretion ( liu et al . 2014 ) .",
    "however , these models are more or less not consistent with observations or can not simulate the long - term evolution of pulsars . and",
    "these models can not explain the different braking indices detected between glitches ( wang et al .",
    "2012 ; lyne et al .",
    "furthermore , the effect of pulsar death ( death line , ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; or death valley , chen & ruderman 1993 ; zhang et al .",
    "2000 ) should be considered in modeling the long term rotational evolution of the pulsar ( contopoulos & spitkovsky 2006 ) .",

    "if the pulsar continually evolve in this trend , it would not dead and might end itself as a magnetar .",
    "it will be hard to explain the observations for : ( 1 ) the number of magnetars are smaller than radio pulsars and most of the pulsars occupy the central region in the @xmath75-@xmath73 diagram ( see figure [ figevo&long ] ) ; ( 2 ) only a small portion of magnetars are radio emitters ( olausen & kaspi 2014 ) ; ( 3 ) the properties of the crab pulsar , psr j1734 - 3333 and other high magnetic field pulsars are significantly different from magnetars ( ng & kaspi 2011 ) . as pulsars slow - down , the density of outflow particles may decrease and the effect of particle wind will recede ( for the sclf cases , the number of particles ( or @xmath28 ) may close to constant , but the particle density still decreases because a reducing goldreich - julian charge density ) . therefore , the effect of pulsar death must be included in modeling the long - term rotational evolution of pulsars .",
    "the essential condition of radio emission for a pulsar is its pair production ( sturock 1971 ; ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) .",
    "the so called pulsar `` death '' means the stopping of pulsar emission ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; chen & ruderman 1993 ; zhang et al .",
    "2000 ; contopoulos & spitkovsky 2006 ) . the death defined by ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) is that : a pulsar dead when the maximum potential drop @xmath76 available from the pulsar is smaller than the acceleration potential needed to accelerate particles . because this death line is model dependent , chen & ruderman ( 1993 ) proposed death `` valley '' by modifying the boundary conditions . and this death `` valley '' was updated by considering different particle acceleration and photon radiation processes ( zhang et al .",
    "however these works are just to separate pulsars with radio emission from those without .",
    "contopoulos & spitkovsky ( 2006 ) included the effect of pulsar death when modeling the rotational evolution of pulsars .",
    "however , the braking indices there are always larger than three . considering particle acceleration and pulsar death simultaneously may give a comprehensive interpretation for both short and long - term rotational evolution of pulsars .",
    "the visual explanation for pulsar death in the pulsar wind model is that the particles in the magnetosphere are exhausted and there are no primary particles generated . for the physical understanding",
    ", we can refer to the equation ( [ edottotal ] ) , expressions @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( i.e. , @xmath79 , xu & qiao 2001 ) , with the pulsar spinning down , the maximum potential of the pulsar ( @xmath80 ) drops , when the maximum potential can not meet the need to accelerate particles ( @xmath81 ) , the pulsar death . besides , the acceleration potential is weakly dependent on the @xmath82 , that is why we can make calculations under the constant acceleration potential ( the cap model ) ( yue et al .",

    "the initial period and transition period can be calculated according the second line , which are same with the values given by the first line within precision .",
    "indicating that the effect of pulsar death can be ignored in the early time . as mentioned before , the particle density decreases as pulsar spin - down .",
    "the gap between these two lines is caused by the reducing of particle density .",
    "when the spin period of crab approaches to the death period @xmath84 , the radio emission tends to stop and the slop of the second line is very large .",

    "in the magnetic dipole radiation model , a pulsar is assumed as a magnetic dipole rotating in vacuum .",
    "it is just a low - order approximation of the true magnetosphere , and there must be particles acceleration and generation process so that the radio emission can be received .",
    "the actual magnetosphere surrounding the pulsar must be filled with plasma and corotate with pulsar because of magnetic freeze . according the special relativity ,",
    "the corotation magnetosphere can not infinitely extend but only exist within the light cylinder .",
    "the magnetosphere is divided into two parts by the light cylinder : the closed magnetic field lines and the open magnetic field lines ( including polar gap and outer gap ) . in the open field line region , particles are accelerated , generate radiation and flow out ( thus taken away some of the rotational energy of the central neutron star ) . in the pulsar wind model ,",
    "the pulsar is braked down by magnetic dipole radiation and particle wind .",
    "but in the electric current loss model , the electric current flow generates a spin - down torque ( harding et al . 1999 ; beskin et al .",
    "based on the same magnetospheric physics , the pulsar wind model and the current loss case are just different point of views , will produce the same results ( e.g. section 3.2 in tong et al .",
    "2013 ) . and",
    "they can be used to check each other .",
    "it is meaningful to take advantage of the existing information and explain more observations .",
    "the particle wind worked on pulsar spin - down was first proven by observations of intermittent pulsar psr b1931 + 24 whose radio emission switches between `` on '' and `` of '' state ( kramer et al .",
    "corresponding calculations for intermittent pulsars in pulsar wind model were made by li et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .    as one of the best observed pulsar , observations of the crab pulsar are relatively comprehensive ( see table [ parameters ] @xmath85 timing results from jodrell bank website ) .",
    "it will be the best target to test radiation models .",
    "the pulsar parameters can be calculated by equations ( [ edot ] ) , ( [ nwind ] ) and ( [ mwind ] ) when model dependent acceleration potential ( or @xmath86 ) is given ( see table [ expressions ] ) .",
    "the goldreich - julian charge density is taken as the primary particle density in these models of xu & qiao ( 2001 ) and wu et al ( 2003 )",
    ". however , yue et al .",
    "( 2007 ) constrained the primary particle density by observations of several pulsars and predicted that it should be @xmath87 times of goldreich - julian charge density . in our calculations ,",
    "the primary particle density is at least @xmath88 times of goldreich - julian charge density . in the vg(cr )",
    "model , a particle density @xmath89 is chosen . when applying the pulsar wind model to intermittent pulsars ,",
    "a goldreich - julian charge density is assumed ( li et al .",
    "as the pulsar spin - down , its out - flow particle density decreases . in the @xmath1 diagram , these intermittent pulsars are on the right of those young pulsars ( see figure [ figevo&long ] ) .",
    "this may explain the different particle density in the crab pulsar and intermittent pulsars .",
    "other studies also found the need for a high particle density in the pulsar magnetosphere , e.g. , when modeling the eclipse of the double pulsar system , giant pulses of the crab pulsar , and magnetar x - ray spectra ( lyutikov 2008 and references therein ) , optical / ultraviolet excess of x - ray dim isolated neutron stars ( tong et al . 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the crab nebula also require a much higher electron flow from the magnetosphere ( buhler & blandford 2014 and references therein ) .",
    "besides , a super goldreich - julian current has been proposed in a series theoretical works about the pairs creations in the acceleration gap ( timokhin & arons , 2013 ; zanotti et al . 2012 ; hirotani 2006 )",
    ". combined with the results in this paper , it is possible that there are high density plasmas ( e.g. , @xmath90-@xmath91 times the goldreich - julian density ) in both open and closed field line regions in the pulsar magnetosphere .      here the updated pulsar wind model is employed to compare with the observations of the crab pulsar .",
    "it can also be applied to other sources . for eight pulsars with meaningful braking index measured ( espinoza et al .",
    "2011 ; lyne et al .",
    "2015 ) , their magnetospheric parameters can also be calculated , including magnetic field , inclination angle , particle density etc . but",
    "the higher second frequency derivatives of some pulsars ( hobbs et al .",
    "2010 ) may be attributed to the fluctuation of magnetosphere ( contopoulos 2007 ) . during this process",
    ", more information will be helpful to constrain the model parameters , e.g. , inclination angle , second braking index .",

    "its rotational energy loss rate will be dominated by the particle wind . also from figure [ figevo&long ] ,",
    "the braking indices of young pulsars will naturally be divided into two groups .",
    "braking indices of pulsars in the first group are close to three , their evolution directions are down to the right in the @xmath1 diagram ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "braking indices in the second group are close to one and their evolution directions are up to the right ( @xmath95 ) . generally speaking",
    ", sources in the second group will be older than the ones in the first group . at present",
    ", there are some hints for the evolution of pulsar braking index ( espinoza 2013 ) .",
    "future more observations will deepen our understanding on this aspect .",
    "glitch is a phenomenon of the pulsar suddenly spinning up and then slowing down by a larger rate . in the pulsar wind model ,",
    "the lower braking index @xmath8 during glitches ( of the crab pulsar ) is due to the larger out - flow particle density .",
    "the increasing particle density is a possible performance associated with glitches .",
    "glitches induced magnetospheric activities are very common in magnetars ( kaspi et al .",
    "2003 ; dib & kaspi 2014 ) . for the high magnetic field pulsar psr j1846@xmath920258",
    ", it also shows a smaller braking index after glitch ( livingstone et al .",
    "the cause of a smaller braking index may be similar to the crab pulsar case .",
    "due to a larger particle outflow , the pulsar should experience some net spindown after glitch .",
    "this has already been observed ( livingstone et al . 2010 ) .",
    "some primary calculations for psr j1846@xmath920258 has been done previously ( tong 2014 , based on a wind braking model designed for magnetars ) .",
    "the smaller braking index of psr j1846@xmath920258 after glitch is consistent with the results here .    from figure [ figevo&long ] and figure [ figevo&models ] , the pulsar will go up - right in the @xmath1 diagram in the wind braking dominated case .",
    "therefore , for pulsars in the up right corner of the @xmath1 diagram ( e.g. , high magnetic field pulsars and magnetars ) , their true dipole magnetic field may be much lower than the characteristic magnetic field .",
    "for magnetar sgr 1806@xmath9220 , its characteristic magnetic field is about @xmath96 ( tong et al .",
    "this dipole magnetic field is too high to understand comfortably ( vigano et al . 2013 ) .",
    "using the physical braking mechanism in this paper , the dipole magnetic field of sgr 1806@xmath9220 will be much lower . in the late stage of a pulsar ,",
    "it will bent and go downward in the @xmath1 diagram .",
    "the crab pulsar and other pulsars will not evolve into the cluster of magnetars .",
    "furthermore , for magnetars , they also will go downward in the @xmath1 diagram when they are aged enough .",
    "this may corresponds to the case of low magnetic field magnetars ( tong & xu 2012 ) .",
    "an updated pulsar wind model which considered the effect of particle density and pulsar death is developed .",
    "it is employed to calculate parameters and simulate the evolution of the crab pulsar .",
    "the braking index @xmath97 is the combined effect of magnetic dipole radiation and particle wind .",
    "the lower braking indices measured between glitches are caused by the increasing particle density . by adding the glitch parameters and a change of period derivative caused by the change of particle density , the theoretical evolution curve",
    "is well fitted with observations ( figure [ figob&model ] ) .",
    "this may be viewed as glitch induced magnetospheric activities in normal pulsars . giving the model dependent acceleration potential drop , the magnetic field ,",
