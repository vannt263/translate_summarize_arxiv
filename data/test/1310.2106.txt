    "with the advent of virgo and ligo in their advanced form , and the probable discovery of gravitational sources , astronomy is facing a major shift in its history .",
    "mankind is indeed entering the era of non - photonic detectors , which can detect and observe gravitational waves ( hereafter gws ) and possibly neutrinos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this will open new windows on physical events that are , at the moment , totally closed ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "it is however probable , and indeed it is already the case @xcite , that the first detections will be of faint events , and will anyway need to be observed in the electromagnetic domain , both to enhance the confidence on the gw and/or neutrino detection and to optimize the scientific return of the detection itself .",
    "this kind of simultaneous observation is however difficult .",
    "theoretical studies @xcite have shown all the difficulty of exploring large error boxes with current electromagnetic instrumentation .",
    "any solution to reduce the error box would strongly help .    among potential sources of gws that could lead to an observable phenomenon during the maximal emission of gws ,",
    "the merging of two compact objects is one of the most promising and best modelled @xcite .",
    "these events are believed to be associated with a class of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , namely the short grbs ( hereafter sgrbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even if other progenitors have been proposed for sgrbs ( such as newborn magnetars ; *",
    "* ) , the merging of two neutron stars ( nss ) in a binary system should produce an extremely intense electromagnetic signal . at the same time , this object has been studied theoretically , and observations have proven that they emit their binding energy @xcite , theoretically as gws . the fact that sgrbs are detectable up to very large distance ( the largest claimed distance of a sgrb is z = 4.6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) should allow easily a combined detection .",
    "ironically , it is the limited distance at which the gw detectors can perform a detection ( the range is 150 mpc for advanced virgo and 200 mpc for advanced ligo ) that dramatically reduces the number of such events ( see * ? ? ?",
    "sgrbs are rare in the universe , and the sampled volume is so small that the final detection rate is low @xcite . despite these limitations , a few strict estimations of the detection rate of an event simultaneously in both windows , based on actual observation , have been done .",
    "most of the results obtained so far were derived from theoretical modelling and population synthesis hypotheses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have composed an estimation rate based on the @xmath0 observations .",
    "however , as we show in section [ compar ] , their selection of data might bias somewhat their result .",
    "the aim of this paper is to strengthen this result , using the most recent observations to estimate that rate .",
    "the major issue of our work is that there is no _ possible _",
    "solution , to date , to claim that a given grb is caused by the merging of a binary ns system ( bns ) .",
    "one can only assume , and this will be our main hypothesis in this work , that most sgrbs are caused by this phenomenon .",
    "mergers can occur also from neutron star ",
    "black hole ( ns  bh ) or black hole ",
    "black hole ( bh  bh ) binary systems .",
    "these last two types of events are probably detectable at larger distances by adv / aligo ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the signal they produce in the detectors is more difficult to compute over the full parameter space , and their rate is poorly constrained .",
    "in addition , it is believed that the electromagnetic signal they produce is weaker than that of bns systems , though this issue is still debated ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and it is unclear whether they produce long or short events .",
    "therefore , in this work , we will consider only the issue of the bns / sgrb connection .",
    "the second problem we face is that the definition of sgrbs is entirely empirical @xcite and has no physical ground : sgrbs last less than 2s _ in the observer frame _ and have harder spectra than lgrbs !",
    "this definition has an obvious limitation : a burst that would be classified as short at a given redshift would be classified as long at a larger redshift , because of time dilation and cosmological effects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "conversely , this does not exclude that at least some lgrbs originate from the merger of nss , or bh ",
    "ns systems ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work ,",
    "we only address the case of sgrbs and we deal with these limitations using another discriminative method to separate sgrbs and lgrbs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we present our selection method and our final sample in section [ sec_method ] ; we then use it to derive the local rate of sgrbs in section [ sec_result ] , and we deduce the rate of simultaneous detections of electromagnetic / gws events from ns  ns binaries ; in section [ sec_discu ] , we discuss our results and their consequences in terms of detectability ; we finally conclude in section [ sec_ccl ] . in the remaining part of this paper ,",
    "all errors are quoted at @xmath1 when not specifically indicated .",
    "we use a standard flat cold dark matter model for the universe , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "sgrb and lgrb stand for short and long grbs , respectively , em for electromagnetic waves , gw for gravitational waves , adv and aligo for the advanced virgo and advanced ligo interferometers , respectively .",
    "the selection of an unbiased sample is of paramount importance for the estimation of the rate .",
    "the main problem is the scarcity of sgrbs , as only a handful of grbs discovered from the _ swift _ spacecraft have a redshift estimate .",
    "meanwhile , the potential sample of bursts ( detected by the _ swift _ satellite from 2004 december to 2012 june 12 ) is of 679 bursts detected , among which 191 have a known redshift .",
    "we thus decided to reconstruct a more accurate sample using three different filters .",
    "as already stated , the use of the canonical definition of a short burst would lead to link this kind of burst with the redshift , a short burst being confused with a long one in case of high redshift ( see equation [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "as we are interested in the nature of the progenitor , this correlation with redshift has to be removed .",
    "we thus decided to use the rest - frame duration as a first criteria , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the 90% burst duration in the rest frame .",
    "we removed from the raw sample all bursts with @xmath7 s.      sgrbs are harder than long ones @xcite .",
    "it is thus tempting to select only the hardest bursts , removing all soft events .",
    "empirically , the spectral model that reproduces best the grb spectrum is the band model @xcite .",
    "this model consists of a broken power law smoothly joined at a typical energy , @xmath8 . from a practical point of view , selecting hard bursts means to set a limit on @xmath8 .",
    "however , this would again lead to a link with the redshift of the burst , as the observed @xmath8 value depends on the ( 1 + @xmath9 ) factor .",
    "things are even more complicated by the fact that the _ swift_-bat instrument has a narrow band , preventing a direct filtering from the spectral parameters . often the bat instrument detects only one segment of this model .",
    "the power - law segment photon indices are usually named @xmath10 for the soft segment and @xmath11 for the hard one .",
    "typically , the value of @xmath10 is of the order of 1.2 and @xmath11 of the order of 2.3 @xcite .",
    "we have assumed that for a hard burst , the bat would have detected only the soft segment @xmath10 ( i.e. the peak energy is above the bat high - energy limit ) .",
    "this translate to consider a burst to be hard only if the measured spectral index is lower than 2 .",
    "we rejected all other events .",
    "the last parameter of selection is the plateau phase .",
    "this phase has been discovered by _ swift _",
    "@xcite and could be due to energy injection @xcite .",
    "it could also represent a soft tail of a disguised lgrb .",
    "lastly , magnetar progenitors are known to produce a plateau phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as we are interested in the merging of an ns binary system ( where few energy should be available once the merging is done ) , we prefer to remove all bursts with a plateau phase , assuming they are related to other kinds of progenitors ( see however * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is a conservative criterion and only less than the half of the candidates that passed the two previous filters survived to this one . because of that , for some rare bursts where the light curve does not allow to determine if a plateau phase is present or not , we relaxed this criteria and validated these events ."
