    "this is completely analoguous to what happens with shei s twisted kink @xcite in the u(1)-njl and z@xmath7-gn models , respectively @xcite .",
    "we start with the scattering of two elementary kinks of the type discussed in the preceding section .",
    "this requires a diagonal matrix @xmath146 .",
    "we set @xmath229 where @xmath230 will be interpreted below .",
    "then the result of using the general formalism for two poles ( @xmath231 ) follows the same pattern as kink - kink scattering in the u(1)-njl model or su(2)-njl model .",

    "one recognizes @xmath239 and @xmath240 as the intrinsic twist factors of the participating solitons .",

    "( [ h2],[h3 ] ) for which we find @xmath249 let us consider some interesting limiting cases .",
    "obviously , the modulus of @xmath250 controls the strength of the kink - kink interaction between the two kinks .",
    "if @xmath242 are parallel , @xmath251 and everything can be rotated into the isospin up channel where we recover scattering of two standard kinks of the u(1)-njl model , with the known time delay factor @xmath252 if @xmath242 are orthogonal , @xmath253 and the two kinks live in the two isospin channels without any interaction ( @xmath254 ) . by varying the angle spanned by @xmath219 and @xmath224 , we can thus vary the strength of the interaction between these two extreme cases .",
    "a special case of the kink - kink scattering problem is the bound state .",
    "this may be viewed as the generic u(2)-twisted kink , since it enables us to connect an arbitrary vacuum @xmath221 at @xmath216 to @xmath137 at @xmath136 . in the rest frame of such a composite kink",
    ", we have to choose @xmath255 some simplifications occur , @xmath256 \\nonumber \\\\ \\vec{q}_2 & = & - { \\cal n}_2 \\left [ 2i \\sigma_{12 } e^{i\\phi_2 } \\sin \\phi_1 \\vec{p}_1 - \\left ( e^{i(\\phi_1+\\phi_2)}-1 \\right ) \\vec{p}_2 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal n}_1^{-2 } & = & { \\cal n}_2^{-2 } = 2 \\left ( 1- \\cos ( \\phi_1+\\phi_2 ) - 2 \\sigma_{12 } \\sigma_{21 } \\sin \\phi_1 \\sin \\phi_2 \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\xi^{-1 } & = & 1 - \\sigma_{12 } \\sigma_{21 } \\frac{2 \\sin \\phi_1 \\sin \\phi_2}{1-\\cos(\\phi_1+\\phi_2 ) } \\label{h11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the one flavor case , it was not possible to construct a bound state of two kinks with the same twist , @xmath257 .",
    "if one specializes the formalism to this case , one recovers a single kink .",
    "in the two flavor case , this restriction does not exist anymore and we can construct a non - trivial bound state out of two constituents with the same twist . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ h11 ] ) reduces to @xmath258 finally , we turn to the twisted breather .",
    "a breather at rest can be generated by choosing @xmath259 and a non - diagonal matrix @xmath146 .",
    "the twisted breather is even more complicated here than in the single flavor case , so we refrain from discussing all possible parameter choices and illustrate the reult for a few simple special cases only .",
    "we choose the same matrix @xmath146 than for one flavor @xcite , @xmath260 and the vectors @xmath242 as @xmath261 thus @xmath262 is the angle between @xmath219 and @xmath224 , @xmath263 if we choose @xmath219 and @xmath224 to be parallel ( @xmath264 ) , we find that @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the twisted breather in the one - flavor case @xcite , @xmath267 choosing @xmath219 and @xmath224 to be orthogonal ( @xmath268 ) one finds @xmath269 with @xmath270 here , the diagonal components @xmath271 are static , whereas the off - diagonal components @xmath272 oscillate with the same frequency as the one - flavor breather , @xmath273 for any other choice of the angle @xmath262 , all components of @xmath34 start to oscillate with the same frequency but different phases .",
    "the corresponding more complicated expressions for @xmath34 can easily be generated using the general framework , but will not be given here .",
    "in this paper , we have studied a variant of the integrable gross - neveu model family which has not yet received much attention so far in 1 + 1 dimensions : the u(2)-njl model with u(2)@xmath1u(2)@xmath2 chiral symmetry .",
    "phenomenologically , in 3 + 1 dimensions , the su(2)@xmath1su(2)@xmath2 model is more relevant .",
    "however , from a theoretical point of view , it is quite instructive to include the u(2 ) model as well . after developing the mean field approach and setting up the tdhf equation for the u(2)-njl model ,",
    "we have studied the vacuum and identified the vacuum manifold as u(2 ) .",
    "small fluctuations in the 4 flat directions give rise to 4 massless pseudoscalar mesons , whereas the other 4 directions yield massive scalars right at threshold @xmath274 .",
    "the chiral spiral construction is especially simple here , as it can be invoked both for baryonic and isospin charge .",
    "the phase diagram is extremely simple , generalizing the known u(1)-njl phase diagram to the ( @xmath275 ) space .",
    "perhaps the most interesting topic is that of soliton dynamics .",
    "here it turns out that a recently developed solution of the matrix bdg system in condensed matter physics fits perfectly the u(2)-njl model .",
    "we have rederived takahashi s results in the language of our previous work on the u(1)-njl model , and confirmed that the fundamental kink is a physical state in the u(2 ) model while appearing only as a confined constituent in the su(2 ) model .",
    "this is another striking example for the close relationship between relativistic quantum field theory toy models and sophisticated , realistic condensed matter problems .    in the present work",
    "together with ref .",
    "@xcite , we have generalized the well - known z@xmath7-gn and u(1)-njl models with abelian chiral groups to two flavors and non - abelian chiral groups su(2 ) and u(2 ) .",
    "the relationship between these various models is summarized in table i.    .relationship among four - fermion models as discussed in main text . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first row contains the original variants of the gn model @xcite with one flavor only and discrete or continuous chiral symmetry , respectively .",
    "the most conspicuous differences between these two models are the phase diagram in the ( @xmath276 ) plane and the role played by twisted kinks , which are free in the u(1 ) model but confined into bound states in the z@xmath7 model .",
    "this pattern repeats itself in the 2nd row , the two - flavor generalizations .",
    "in fact , models in the same column share identical phase diagrams in the ( @xmath276 ) plane , as first noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the first column .",
    "a further generalization to the groups su(@xmath115 ) and u(@xmath115 ) is straightforward , thereby extending the spectrum of integrable quantum field theories substantially .",
    "it is plausible ( but ought to be checked in future work ) that the marked differences in the phase diagram and in the role of twisted kinks show up for arbitrary numbers of flavors as well .",
    "our final remark concerns the relationship between the leading order large @xmath0 results and the method of non - abelian bosonization @xcite .",
    "it is well known that two - dimensional multi - color and -flavor njl models at any finite @xmath277 can be mapped onto decoupled bosonic field theories of wess - zumino - novikov - witten type @xcite and free bosonic fields .",
    "recently there has been a lot of progress in solving such models using conformal field theory techniques and numerical methods , even for the case when chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by a mass term and more than one coupling constants , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "it would be interesting to compute space - time dependent condensates in these integrable models at finite @xmath278 and compare them with the results in the limit @xmath279 , as this limit is expected to be rather singular .",
