    "the interdisciplinary application of statistical physics methods has emerged constantly . for example , numerous investigations on time series analysis resulting from successive matches in sports leagues have been published in recent years @xcite .",
    "most of the studies focus on the detailed analysis of soccer characteristics @xcite and the question if the champion is always the best team @xcite . by having a closer look",
    ", it can be found that often the studies can be separated into phenomenological and model - free approaches .",
    "+ in contrast to the latter studies @xcite which often focus on a time series analysis , the phenomenological constructs are based on the estimation of several parameters to answer open questions like the prediction of match results @xcite . + in addition to the estimation of match outcomes , specific interest has been spent on the soccer goal distribution .",
    "recent findings , following a larger discussion @xcite concerning the distribution of goals of a team in a match have indicated a poissonian distribution which reveals the interpretation of goals as rare events @xcite . a few studies also aimed to yield a quantitative expression for the quality of the teams @xcite .",
    "it has been recently validated , that a good variable for a detailed differentiation is given by the average goal difference of a team .",
    "it has to be mentioned that in contrast to the public opinion , a time - series analysis has indicated a nearly constant value over a season @xcite .",
    "this fact is also independent of coach changes @xcite which is often the method of choice for team managers after a long period of failure .",
    "in addition to the detailed study of soccer characteristics , further results have been also published on the properties of basketball @xcite and the analysis of tennis matches @xcite .",
    "+ in contrast to the world - wide interest in soccer , team handball is popular mainly in europe .",
    "a growing interest in the german handball bundesliga and in team handball in general over the last years can be found which is well reflected by the number of matches broadcasted at tv and the increasing number of active non - professional players @xcite .",
    "+ for this study , we analyzed the specific characteristics of the highest league in german professional team handball .",
    "the german team handball bundesliga consists of 18 teams where each team has two matches against the other teams , one match at home and one as a guest .",
    "the bundesliga can be seen as a round - robin tournament without playoffs or a final .",
    "thus , a total number of 306 matches divided into 34 match days are played during a season .",
    "after each season , the teams at the end of the table are replaced in the following season by the promoted teams of the second league .",
    "+ in this study we focus on a model - free time series analysis of team handball results of the german bundesliga . the data set consists of ten seasons starting from 2001/2002 .",
    "we will show how recently developed methods for the study of soccer characteristics @xcite can be transferred to the analysis of team handball results .",
    "the direct comparison between team handball and soccer results allows to extract specific characteristics and differences .",
    "+ our main results involve the time evolution of the team fitness , the specific goal distribution and the home advantage which are compared to recently published results for soccer @xcite . in addition , we will also analyze the properties of promoted teams and propose an explanation for the success of the best teams .",
    "our results can be used to estimate the stochastic contributions which influence a match outcome .",
    "these findings allow to present a simple method for the prediction of match results and match winners in good accuracy to the real outcomes .",
    "in contrast to the public opinion , we will show that the variance of performance differences between handball teams is less pronounced than it has been found for the german soccer league .",
    "the dominance of a few teams like thw kiel , sg flensburg - handewitt , tbv lemgo and hsv hamburg in the last years can be mainly explained by a significant increase of the total sum of goals in a match and improved attack qualities @xcite .",
    "we have downloaded the match results of the german bundesliga from http://www.sis-handball.de . for technical reasons , like a non - constant number of teams in earlier years we have omitted all seasons before 2001/2002 .",
    "the last season was 2010/2011 .",
    "the total number of matches used in this study was 3060 .",
    "the second league consists of a northern and a southern division where each division consists of 18 teams .",
    "the best teams are promoted in the following season into the bundesliga . throughout the manuscript",
    ", we denote the values related to the number of goals in a match with @xmath0 while values over a season are denoted by the capital letter @xmath1 .",
    "we start our analysis by the investigation of the inherent characteristics of the game .",
    "the win probability at home is given by 58.9% .",
    "this value coincides well with recent values for the spanish team handball league where a home win probability of 61% has been found @xcite .",
    "the guest win probability is given by 33.2% and a draw between both teams appeared with a probability of 7.9% .",
    "+ for 47.2% of all teams , a positive goal difference after 34 match days has been found which roughly corresponds to the first eight teams of the table .",
    "the percentage of goals scored by these teams compared to the total sum of goals is given by 50.8% .",
    "this indicates that eight teams in a season throw more than half of the total number of goals .",
    "+ the largest total number of goals per match has been observed in december 2005 in the match thw kiel vs.  sc magdeburg .",
    "the result was 54:34 . in agreement ,",
    "the largest number of total attacks with 160 was also found in this match @xcite .",
    "the lowest total number of goals was 32 as it was found for the match fa gppingen vs.  sg willsttt / schutterwald ( 19:13 ) in march 2002 .",
    "the largest goal difference results from the match hsv hamburg vs.  wilhelmshavener hv in march 2008 ( 44:17 ) . + some basic properties of a single match like the mean number of goals @xmath0 , the home goals @xmath2 and the away goals @xmath3 as well as the corresponding variances are presented in tab .  [ tab1 ] .",
    ".mean number of goals @xmath0 , home goals @xmath2 , away goals @xmath3 for a single match and the variances @xmath4 for the corresponding values . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the occurrence of an asymmetric behavior can be clearly identified .",
    "teams with positive goal differences mainly achieve a stronger correlation of @xmath5 with the attack ( 0.797 ) while the correlation with the defense is significantly weaker ( -0.231 ) .",
    "in contrast , we have found for teams with a negative goal difference a larger correlation coefficient of -0.597 with the defense while the attack is weaker correlated ( 0.449 ) .",
    "the direct correlation between attack and defense is given by 0.403 for teams with a positive goal difference and 0.449 for teams with a negative goal difference .",
    "these values are in complete disagreement to recent results for soccer where a strong correlation between attack and defense has been validated @xcite .",
    "+ to investigate these findings in more detail , we will show that the analysis of the variances @xmath6 for the goals and the goals against in a match as presented in tab .",
    "[ tab3 ] can give further insights .",
    "the ratio @xmath7 for team handball is given by @xmath8 .",
    "this indicates that the attack properties expressed by the number of thrown goals are broader distributed than the number of goals against . for soccer ,",
    "the corresponding ratio gives @xmath9 which is significantly smaller .",
    "hence , due to the study of these values as well as the differences for the study of the corresponding slopes in fig .  [ fig8 ] , it can be concluded that the attack qualities for handball teams are significantly broader distributed than the defense qualities in agreement to fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . + as a last point we have calculated the properties of promoted teams .",
    "the values for the goal difference @xmath10 after 34 match days for season @xmath11 in the second league and the subsequent @xmath12 season in the bundesliga have been calculated and presented in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "it can be clearly seen that all teams have a negative or negligible positive goal difference in the following bundesliga season .",
    "the linear regression of the goal difference follows a slope of 1 and the intercept is given by @xmath13 goals , these values correspond well to the intuitive observation , that the establishment of promoted teams in the bundesliga is a very challenging task .",
    "the general large value of -325 goals demonstrates the qualitative differences between the bundesliga and the second league .",
    "we have analyzed the results of the german handball bundesliga for 10 seasons starting from 2001/2002 .",
    "our findings have shown a significant increase of the sum of goals per match in the last years .",
    "we are able to explain this increase by novel attack strategies which allow a rapid turnover and an acceleration of the game . despite this increase",
    ", we have found a nearly constant home advantage represented by roughly two goals .",
    "it has to be noticed , that compared to the total sum of goals , the home advantage is nearly negligible . +",
    "in contrast to soccer , we have found a binomial distribution function for the number of goals scored by a team in a match . a simple picture for the goal efficiency of an attacking team is given by the throwing of a coin .",
    "+ in the last years , the dominance of a few teams in the bundesliga has lead to a larger discussion .",
    "it has been argued , that the disappearance of surprises like the winning of outsiders would lead to a minor public interest . in agreement to these arguments",
    ", we have clearly shown that the stochastic contributions to a handball match which represents the mentioned surprises are significantly smaller compared to soccer . however , by a direct transformation of the corresponding values , we were able to show that the intuitive dominance of these teams is exclusively related to the large number of total goals in a match .",
    "+ by analyzing the results for the team fitness expressed by the goal difference , we have indicated a short time decay within 5 match days after the fitness correlation reaches a constant value . in general , a slight decrease over the season has been also validated .",
    "these findings are in disagreement to soccer results , where nearly constant fitness values over 34 match days has been indicated .",
    "we assume that these variations can be explained by the long duration of the season , mostly from september to june .",
    "in addition a lot of the players of the german bundesliga are involved in national teams .",
    "it has to be noticed that each season is intercepted by a world or an european championship which facilitate injuries as well as an exhaust of the players .",
    "we propose that these additional matches as well as training effects result in decreasing fitness values .",
    "+ in addition , we have also found a nearly identical decay between subsequent seasons for the long time fitness behavior compared to soccer results .",
    "these findings give a first hint that economic facts and other circumstances as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite are also relevant for team handball .",
    "+ finally we have shown that successful teams strengthen their attack instead of the defense .",
    "these findings are in good agreement to recent studies concerning the development of successful team strategies @xcite .",
    "in contrast to soccer , where the correlation between offense and defense is nearly identical , we have validated that the offense in team handball is more pronounced , specifically for the best teams .",
    "+ due to the small stochastic contributions to the match results after ten match days , we have proposed a simple prediction method for the outcome of handball matches .",
    "we have been able to determine the winning team with a probability of roughly 74% .",
    "+ hence we assume , that the conceptual analysis of team handball and soccer results which has been presented previously and in this work can be also applied to other types of sports , _ e. g. _ basketball and may help to offer a systematic comparison .",
