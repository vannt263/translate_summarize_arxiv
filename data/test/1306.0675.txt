    "scattering dynamics from periodic time - varying potentials is of fundamental importance in different areas of physics , involving fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics , such as the problem of tunneling times @xcite , classical and quantum chaos @xcite , and the quantum transport properties of microscopic and mesoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "several studies have investigated in details the scattering properties of time - varying potential barriers or wells based on the floquet formalism ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , with applications to problems such as photon - assisted tunneling @xcite , quantum pumping @xcite , electron scattering by intense laser - driven potentials @xcite , and electron transport in graphene with modulated barriers @xcite .",
    "these systems can display a quite rich quantum and classical dynamics , such as chaotic scattering and chaos - assisted tunneling @xcite , coherent destruction of tunneling @xcite , quantum interference @xcite , fano resonances @xcite , field - induced barrier transparency @xcite , and particle - field entanglement in the second - quantization regime @xcite .",
    "noticeably , the scattering dynamics from a periodic time - varying potential barrier or well is analogous , under certain conditions , to bragg scattering of monochromatic matter or classical waves from a periodic ( grating ) potential @xcite .",
    "for example , a quantum - optical analogy can be established between the well - known problem of bragg scattering of light waves from a diffraction grating under grazing incidence and the scattering dynamics of a non - relativistic quantum particle from a periodic time - varying potential well or barrier @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", a great and increasing interest has been devoted to study the properties of quantum systems described by a _",
    "non - hermitian _",
    "hamiltonian @xcite , especially in the context @xmath0-symmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "scattering in non - hermitian potentials has been experimentally investigated , for example , in the diffraction of matter waves from complex optical potentials @xcite and for light transport in optical structures with tailored gain and loss regions @xcite .",
    "non - hermiticity has been shown to strongly affect bragg scattering in imaginary periodic potentials , with important effects such as the violation of the friedel s law @xcite and unidirectional invisibility @xcite .",
    "the scattering properties of static and non - hermitian potential wells and barriers have been investigated in several previous works as well @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown rather generally that , as opposed to an hermitian potential barrier or well , the reflectance in a non - hermitian potential barrier is generally different for left and right incidence @xcite .",
    "however , the scattering properties of imaginary potential barriers or wells periodically oscillating in time have not received attention to date .    in this work",
    "we consider the scattering properties from exactly - solvable time - periodic complex potential wells , which show the rather exceptional property to appear _ reflectionless _ and to _ conserve _ the energy of the transmitted particle at any energy of the incident particle @xcite .",
    "this means that the particle , in addition to not being reflected from the potential well , does not exchange energy with the photon field , regardless the initial energy of the particle , i.e. the scattering matrix elements to all the floquet channels @xcite vanish . in the analogous problem of wave diffraction from a complex grating potential @xcite discussed above",
    ", this means the entire absence of grating diffraction orders , both in reflection and transmission @xcite , which are analogous to the floquet scattering channels in the time - periodic case .",
    "we note that , as the existence of _ static _ reflectionless potentials is well - known in quantum physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , including the case of non - hermitian potential wells @xcite , the existence of reflectionless and energy - conserving potentials _ periodically - oscillating in time _ found in our work has not been predicted yet to the best of our knowledge and provides a nontrivial result in the basic scattering theory of oscillating potentials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii the basic principles of particle scattering form an oscillating potential are briefly reviewed , and its connection to bragg scattering of matter or classical waves from a diffraction grating is discussed . in sec.iii",
    "two exactly - solvable families of scattering - free non - hermtian oscillating potentials are introduced by application of the darboux transformation for the time - dependent scrhdinger equation .",
    "the absence of floquet scattering is checked by numerical simulations of the schrdinger equation in sec.iv .",
    "finally , the main conclusions and a brief discussion of open questions are presented in sec.v .",
    "the scattering of a quantum particle from an oscillating potential is described by the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( with @xmath1 ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the time - periodic potential with period @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the scattering potential is localized at around @xmath5 with @xmath6 as @xmath7 [ see fig.1(a ) ] , so that far from @xmath5 the asymptotic solutions to eqs.(1 ) are free - particle ( plane wave ) states .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the scattering of a quantum particle from an oscillating potential with limited support , as described by eq.(1 ) , is analogous the the bragg scattering of a monochromatic matter or optical wave from a two - dimensional diffraction grating , as shown in fig.1(b ) ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , let us consider the scattering of a monochromatic light wave at wavelength ( in vacuum ) @xmath8 from a two - dimensional dielectric grating with refractive index @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the index change from the substrate refractive index @xmath11 and the grating potential @xmath12 is periodic , along the spatial direction @xmath13 , with period @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "for a te - polarized optical wave ( @xmath16 ) , the electric field @xmath17 satisfies the helmholtz equation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 . for grazing incidence , after setting @xmath20 the field envelope @xmath21 satisfies the schrdinger - like ( paraxial ) wave equation @xcite @xmath22 which has the same form as eq.(1 ) , provided that the temporal variable @xmath23 is replaced by the spatial ( paraxial ) propagation distance @xmath13 and the potential @xmath24 is defined by the index change @xmath12 . in the following , we will specifically refer to the scattering problem of a quantum particle from an oscillating potential in the framework of eq.(1 ) , however the same analysis holds for the bragg scattering problem at grazing incidence on a diffraction grating .    .",
    "the energy of the incidence particle is @xmath25 .",
    "the reflected and transmitted particle states correspond to the various floquet channels at energies @xmath26 .",
    "( b ) schematic of bragg diffraction of a light or matter wave from a grating potential at grazing incidence .",
    "the reflected and transmitted diffraction orders from the grating correspond to the floquet channels in ( a).,width=302 ]    let us consider a particle with momentum @xmath27 and energy @xmath28 incident onto the scattering potential from the left side .",
    "the solution to eq.(1 ) has the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the incident particle state and @xmath31 is the scattered state . according to floquet theory",
    ", @xmath31 has the following asymptotic form @xmath32 for @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the complex coefficients @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the propagative modes ( i.e. for indices @xmath41 with @xmath42 , corresponding to a real - valued momentum @xmath43 ) define the transmission and reflection coefficients for the various floquet channels at energies @xmath44 for left - side incidence @xcite . in a similar way , one can introduce the floquet reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 for right - side particle incidence , which are formally obtained from eq.(4 ) by the change @xmath47 and by reversing @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the asymptotic behavior eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "note that , as compared to the scattering from a static potential , in addition to a non - vanishing probability of the particle to be reflected from the potential , the particle energy @xmath25 is not conserved during the interaction because of energy exchange ( absorption and emission ) with the photon field . in the analogous problem of bragg scattering from a diffraction grating [ fig.1(b ) ] ,",
    "the reflection and transmission coefficients of the various floquet channels correspond to the reflection and transmission amplitudes of the various diffraction orders .",
    "absence of floquet scattering from an oscillating potential for left - side particle incidence can be defined by the conditions @xmath50 for any @xmath41 with @xmath51 , and @xmath52 for @xmath53 , which imply the absence of reflected waves and the conservation of the energy for the transmitted particle .",
    "such conditions extend to the time - periodic case the well - known case of _ reflectionless _ static potentials ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , where only the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath54 and @xmath55 are involved .",
    "our goal is to synthesize an oscillating potential well which does not show floquet scattering . to this aim ,",
    "we use the method of the darboux transformation , well - known in problems of reflectionless static potentials , extended to the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "let us indicate by @xmath56 and @xmath57 two time - dependent hamiltonians with potentials @xmath58 and @xmath24 , respectively . a linear differential operator @xmath59 of first order in @xmath60 , with time - dependent coefficients and satisfying the intertwining relation @xmath61 is called a first - order darboux transformation operator .",
    "its explicit form is given by @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is an arbitrary function of time @xmath23 and @xmath64 is any solution to the equation @xmath65 . the intertwining relation ( 7 )",
    "holds provided that the two potentials @xmath58 and @xmath24 are connected by the relation @xmath66 note that , if @xmath67 is any solution to the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath68 , then the darboux transform of @xmath67 , defined by @xmath69 is a solution to the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath70 .",
    "this result readily follows from the intertwining relation ( 7 ) .",
    "note that , for an initial real - valued potential @xmath58 , the partner potential @xmath24 obtained from eq.(9 ) turns out to be real - valued provided that the function @xmath71 $ ] has a phase @xmath72 which is at most a quadratic function of @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath73 ; only under such a constraint , after setting @xmath74 $ ] the partner potential @xmath24 turns out to be real - valued @xcite .",
    "this is a rather severe constraint , and indeed the method of darboux transformation to the time - dependent schrdinger equation in the hermitian case has been applied to rather few and special cases @xcite . in particular , the hermitian constraint does not allow one to synthesize an oscillating quantum well with suppressed floquet scattering , like for a static potential well ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , if we remove the hermiticity constraint , allowing the potential to become imaginary , an oscillating quantum well with suppressed floquet scattering can be synthesized by the method of the darboux transformation .    , @xmath75 , @xmath76 at times @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "( b ) same as ( a ) but for the potential ( 19 ) [ @xmath82 , @xmath76].,width=302 ]    to this aim , let us assume @xmath84 , and let us consider the darboux operator @xmath85 obtained by taking @xmath86 in eq.(8 ) .",
    "we will consider specifically two distinct solvable cases . in the former case the floquet scattering",
    "is fully suppressed , however the potential well introduces an advancement of the transmitted particle , i.e. there is a non - vanishing energy - dependent phase of the transmission @xmath87 like in the hermitian reflectionless potential well @xcite . in the latter case the floquet scattering",
    "is fully suppressed and the oscillating potential well appears to be fully invisible , i.e. @xmath88 .    the former case is obtained by assuming the following solution @xmath64 to the equation @xmath89 @xmath90 where @xmath91 is an arbitrary real - valued parameter , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , @xmath94 are two arbitrary complex - valued parameters , satisfying the constraint @xmath95 for @xmath96 . for example , by taking @xmath75 such a condition is satisfied provided that @xmath97 .",
    "this constraint ensures that @xmath64 does not vanish for any time @xmath23 , thus avoiding singularities in the partner potential @xmath24 . using eqs.(9 ) and ( 11 ) , the partner potential @xmath24 associated to @xmath84 via the darboux transformation can be readily calculated and reads explicitly @xmath98 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is periodic with period @xmath4 . a typical behavior of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath24 over one oscillation cycle is shown in fig.2(a ) .",
    "note that , for @xmath99 , the potential @xmath24 becomes stationary ( time - independent ) , namely @xmath100 , which belongs to the well - known class of hermitian reflectionless potentials @xcite . to show the absence of floquet scattering in the time - periodic case ,",
    "let us construct the solution to eq.(1 ) , with the potential @xmath24 given by eq.(12 ) , corresponding to a free particle of momentum @xmath27 and energy @xmath28 incident on the left side , i.e. of the form defined by eqs.(3 - 6 ) .",
    "such a solution is simply given by the daboux transformation of the free - particle state @xmath101 , i.e. [ see eq.(10 ) ] @xmath102 note that , since @xmath103 for @xmath104 , and @xmath105 for @xmath106 , a comparison of eqs.(14 ) and ( 15 ) with eqs.(3 - 6 ) yields the following expression for the reflection and transmission coefficients of the various floquet channels for left - side particle incidence @xmath107 with @xmath108 .",
    "equations ( 16 ) prove that in the oscillating potential ( 12 ) the floquet scattering is fully suppressed . note that @xmath109 , i.e. the scattering matrix is unitary in spite the potential is non - hermitian .",
    "note also that the phase of the transmission amplitude @xmath55 does not depend on the frequency @xmath110 of the oscillating potential , and it is equal to the one of the static reflectionless potential obtained in the limit @xmath111 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of this phase term is to slightly _ advance _ and distort ( narrow ) a wave packet that crosses the potential well , like in the hermitian case @xcite . the group delay ( phase time )",
    "is given by @xmath112 which is negative , indicating an advancement of the wave packet .",
    "the previous relations ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) , derived for left - side particle incidence , are also valid for a particle incident from the right side of the oscillating potential well ; this result can be readily proven by considering the asymptotic behavior of the darboux transformation @xmath113 of the free - particle plane wave @xmath114 , describing a freely moving particle moving from the right to the left sides with momentum @xmath27 .",
    "hence , like in the hermtian case our non - hermitian potential well behaves symmetrically for left and right - side incidence , contrary to e.g. @xmath0-symmetric potential wells or barriers which show left / right handedness @xcite . in fact , while in a @xmath0-symmetric potential the imaginary part of the potential is an odd function of space , in our case it is an even function for spatial inversion @xmath115 , see e.g. fig.2(a ) .",
    "the second family of oscillating quantum wells without floquet scattering is synthesized by assuming the following solution @xmath64 to the equation @xmath89 @xmath116 where @xmath91 is an arbitrary real - valued parameter , @xmath117 , and @xmath93 , @xmath94 are two arbitrary real - valued parameters with @xmath118 . such a condition ensures that @xmath64 is a nonvanishing function , and thus the partner potential @xmath24 is not singular .",

    "equations ( 22 ) show that in the oscillating potential ( 19 ) the floquet scattering is fully suppressed .",
    "in addition , since @xmath124 , the oscillating well is invisible , i.e. it does not introduce any delay / advancement nor distortion of a wave packet crossing the potential .",

    "we have shown that families of non - hermitian oscillating potential wells can be synthesized by application of the darboux transformation to the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "while with this technique we could not synthesize scattering - free oscillating potentials of hermitian type , by allowing the potential to become - complex - valued , i.e. the hamiltonian non - hermitian , two families of scattering - free and norm - conserving oscillating potentials have been introduced , admitting the analytical expressions defined by eqs.(12 ) and ( 19 ) .",
