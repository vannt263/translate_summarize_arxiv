    "chemical and biological systems quite generally are stochastic in nature .",
    "the stochasticity may arise from the inherent probabilistic nature of the processes involved or external environmental interferences  accordingly they are referred to as  intrinsic \" and  extrinsic \" noise , respectively . for a chemical system specified by certain reaction rate constants ,",
    "the chemical reactions in actual reality vary randomly , and molecular numbers do fluctuate  this is intrinsic to the system @xcite . similarly biological processes like gene expression @xcite involve intrinsic stochasticity . as opposed to this , if fluctuations in the medium or other chemical components external to the subsystem of interest , indirectly affect the biochemical processes involved , they are regarded as extrinsic .",
    "although for biochemical systems with large number of molecules , deterministic approximations of chemical reactions are often enough , for systems with small number of molecules , intrinsic fluctuations are relatively large and stochastic treatment is necessary . in the latter case , the system s response may go beyond mere small excursions about the averages and unexpected behavior may appear due to random crossing of thresholds .",
    "a theoretical framework within which intrinsic noise in biochemical systems is studied is the chemical master equation ( cme ) approach .",
    "a widely used numerical method to exactly implement the cme is gillespie algorithm @xcite , as the cme is often not easily analytically tractable .",
    "noise , intrinsic or extrinsic , is commonly thought of as an undesirable disturbance . yet in the realm of non - linear systems , it is well known now that noise can aid the output attain regularity , or at times , reveal hidden order . here by  regularity \" we imply either enhanced periodicity of the output response , or enhanced correlation of the output response to the input signal . in this paper , we study primarily periodic stochastic resonance ( psr ) and aperiodic stochastic resonance ( asr ) .",
    "these effects have been seen in multiple non - linear systems @xcite with extrinsic noise . when a non - linear system is near a bifurcation threshold , and subjected to an weak input signal superposed with a noise , the response of the output shows maximum  regularity \" for an optimum strength of noise .",
    "the input signal used for psr is periodic and for asr is aperiodic . the superimposed noise used in earlier studies",
    "were mostly extrinsic  for example , in the theoretical models @xcite noise has been added externally to the dynamical equations , while in experiments on electrochemical cell @xcite external noise has been added to the voltage .",
    "a natural question is that can these phenomena be seen as a result of variation of _ intrinsic noise _ inherent to the system , near a bifurcation threshold ?",
    "experimentalists vary different sources of internal noise to study regularity of response , suitable and specific to their system of interest  e.g. in an electrochemical cell chloride ion concentration was varied @xcite , while in hippocampal ca1 neurons sub - threshold cathodic current was used @xcite .",
    "although sources of internal noise can be diverse in practical systems , for keeping our theoretical discussion general , we follow the standard ideas of intrinsic stochasticity in chemical reactions used by gillespie @xcite .",
    "the idea is to simulate cme numerically using _ exact _ stochastic simulation algorithm given by gillespie @xcite . instead of the latter direct approach , in the literature , often chemical langevin equation ( cle ) @xcite",
    "has been used @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that cle is an approximation of cme @xcite , and sometimes produce misleading results @xcite .",
    "therefore , cme is preferable . in this paper",
    "we implement cme using the gillespie method .    the phenomenon of coherence resonance ( cr ) @xcite , where there is no input sub - threshold signal , has been studied earlier using gillespie and cle method @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "demonstration of psr and asr in a chemical system with hopf bifurcation using exact cme approach is not well known ; although this has been studied for bistable nonlinear chemical systems @xcite . in the present work , we study psr and asr in the chemical brusselator system using gillespie algorithm .",
    "furthermore , we explore the effect on psr and asr due to the interplay of extrinsic and intrinsic noises .",
    "apart from that , we revisit the cr and another noise driven phenomenon to make some interesting observations .",
    "the brusselator oscillator @xcite system involves the following four chemical reactions .",
    "z_1 & & x  : z_1  fixed + z_2 + x & & y + z_3  : z_2  fixed   + 2 x + y & & 3 x + x & & z_4 [ bruss ] @xmath0 and @xmath1 are kept fixed by having infinite sources of these reactants . in eq .",

    "the numbers of @xmath6 and @xmath7 vary with time ; out of them @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the primary variables of interest . for certain choice of the reaction rate parameters , the reactants @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 fluctuate around fixed point values , while other choice of rates , they fluctuate around limit cycle behavior .",
    "these two regimes are separated by a hopf bifurcation . within gillespie algorithm , propensity functions @xcite for the above reactions",
    "are , _ 1=z_1k_1 ,   _ 2=z_2xk_2/ ,",
    "3=x(x-1)yk_3/^2 ,  and   _ 4=xk_4 .",
    "[ propensity ] respectively .",
    "we discuss the gillespie algorithm @xcite for this system briefly . as @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "coming from infinite sources , are not time varying , we consider a state vector @xmath10 excluding them , namely @xmath11 . starting with a state vector @xmath10 at time @xmath12 , the @xmath13 reaction out of the four in eq .",
    "[ propensity ] is chosen with a probability @xmath14 , after a waiting time @xmath15 , drawn from a probability distribution function @xmath16 .",

    "[ propensity ] , and @xmath18 , and these are functions of @xmath10 . after the implementing @xmath13 reaction , the state vector @xmath10 is updated to @xmath19*s*(t)@xmath20 , where using eq .",
    "[ bruss ] one can easily see that the state change vectors , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the way to tune intrinsic noise strength to study resonances for this system , is to vary @xmath5 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , keeping the concentrations @xmath25 and @xmath26 fixed by hand . under the latter condition",
    ", we observed that the numbers @xmath27 also spontaneously adjust to keep their concentrations @xmath28 and @xmath29 , on an average close to a constant .",
    "the observation is expected since the concentration @xmath30 and @xmath31 , if approximated to be deterministic , satisfy the following equations : & = & k_1 z_1 - k_2 z_2 x + k_3 x^2 y - k_4 x + & = & k_2 z_2 x - k_3 x^2 y. [ bruss1 ] the above equations show that if the concentration @xmath32 and @xmath33 are fixed , the concentration @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be determined .",
    "thus by increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath5 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , keeping concentrations @xmath32 and @xmath33 fixed , we ensure that we stay at the same parameter set point of the non - linear system , and keep decreasing ( increasing ) the  intrinsic noise \" around it . the condition for getting limit cycle behavior for the deterministic eq .",

    "we tune the intrinsic noise strength for these reactions by varying @xmath5 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , such that the concentrations @xmath25 and @xmath26 are held fixed by hand as discussed above .",
    "the noise makes the system occasionally excurse into lcr from fpr and one sees spikes in @xmath30 and @xmath31 as a result of that . for different noise strengths we have looked at the output response @xmath30 and @xmath31 , but in the subsequent discussion we will focus only on the variable @xmath30 for brevity .    to keep the discussion simple",
    "we will suppress the explicit dimensions of the rate constants @xmath42 , and the volume @xmath5 .",
    "this makes us avoid putting any units for @xmath43 , and @xmath44 in all the subsequent figures 2 - 5 .",
    "furthermore , we denote the strength of the intrinsic noise by @xmath5  _ the larger the @xmath5 , the smaller the intrinsic noise_. thus in all the figures 2 - 4 , noise decreases along the increasing @xmath5 axis .    to characterize the regularity in the response of the system , a measure of the correlation between output response and input signal , called the power norm @xmath44 @xcite",
    "is used : c_0 = ( x(t ) - x)(s(t ) - s ) .",
    "[ c0 ] here @xmath45 denotes the time average .",
    "the variable @xmath46 is the time varying output of the system at time t , and @xmath47 is the input signal .",

    "@xmath44 can be positive or negative depending on the relative sign of output response and the input signal . in this study",
    "@xmath44 is always positive , but for easier comparison with earlier publications @xcite we use @xmath48 .",

    "the values of @xmath36 and @xmath39 are different for different cases and are mentioned in the respective subsections .      to study the psr , we choose @xmath36 and @xmath39 to be time dependent : @xmath54 and @xmath55^{1/2}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath56 is a time varying _ periodic _ signal . by doing periodic modulation of @xmath36 and @xmath39 with time ,",
    "the average location @xmath57 of the set point gets modulated periodically with time and is given as ( @xmath58 )  see the relations just below eq .",

    "the sub - threshold signal amplitude value is @xmath65 percentage of the threshold value ( separation between the average set point position and bifurcation point ) . for these parameters and the input signal we run our gillespie simulation for different values of @xmath5 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 , thereby varying the intrinsic noise strength .",

    "if extrinsic noise was present in the system , would the internal noise causing the phenomenon of psr , act to reinforce or subdue the former effect ? to explore this interesting question of interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic noises ,",
    "we proceed to add a noise term to the average set point position : @xmath67 .",
    "we choose extrinsic noise @xmath68 to be a uniform box distribution between @xmath69 $ ] and @xmath70 .",

    "the dashed curve in fig . [ psr](b ) shows that the resonance occurs at a smaller value of @xmath5 ( i.e. larger intrinsic noise ) .",

    "asr is similar to psr , except that the signal @xmath72 is aperiodic .",
    "the input aperiodic signal used by us is an aperiodic pulse train .",
    "aperiodicity comes only in the interpulse interval of the signal , which given by @xmath73 . here",
    "r is a random number drawn from uniform box distribution between 0 to 1 .",

    "the effect is interesting but this procedure is unsuitable for tuning inherent noise to study resonance phenomena in the system .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that an optimal value of the intrinsic noise present in a chemical brusselator system can induce enhanced  regularity \" in response , seen in phenomena like psr and asr , just like extrinsic noise .",

    "the approximation involves assumptions that ( i ) the expected number of occurrences of each reaction within the update time interval of the langevin equation is very large , and ( ii ) the reaction rates remain constant within these update time intervals . assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) are hard to satisfy simultaneously when the molecular number of species are small ."
