    "it is well known that the cross section of hard scattering processes can be described as the convolution of parton distributions ( pdfs ) and the cross sections of hard subprocesses computed at parton level using perturbative qcd .",
    "the usual pdfs , obtained from inclusive experimental data , is the diagonal element of an operator in the wilson operator product expansion ( ope ) . on the other hand",
    ", there is a set of exclusive reactions which are described by the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix , where the momentum , helicity or charge of the outgoing target are not the same as those of the corresponding incident particle .",
    "examples of such reactions are the virtual photon compton scattering ( dvcs ) ( @xmath4 ) and the vector meson electroproduction ( @xmath5 ) . in these cases ,",
    "the difference with the inclusive case is the longitudinal components of the incoming and outgoing proton momentum , which depend on the photon virtuality @xmath6 and the @xmath7 center of mass energy @xmath8 .",
    "precision data are becoming available for hard scattering processes whose description requires knowledge of these off - diagonal ( or skewed ) parton distributions .",
    "the exclusive diffractive dvcs process at large @xmath6 provides a comparatively clean procedure for extracting information on the gluons within the proton in a non - forward kinematic case . in recent years",
    "the study of deep inelastic lepton - proton scattering ( dis ) has produced detailed information of the proton structure in terms of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the optical theorem states that the leading dis process of a single virtual photon exchange can be viewed as identical to the forward elastic scattering of a virtual photon from the proton .",
    "this scattering , known as the forward compton scattering process , is the same as a dis process ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diags]-a ) with its mirrored reaction and relates the total cross section @xmath9 with the imaginary part of the forward amplitude @xmath10 .",

    "[ fig : diags]-b ) . in analogy with dis which relates the imaginary part of the forward compton amplitude and pdfs , in the dvcs process",
    "parton distributions are also used to parameterise the non - perturbative part of the interaction in the non - forward region . in this last case ,",
    "the distributions have to be calculated in terms of non - diagonal , rather than diagonal , pdfs .",
    "they are commonly called generalised parton distributions ( gpds ) .",
    "they reduce to the ordinary pdfs in the limit of zero skewedness , i.e. , the forward limit .",
    "+ let us first summarize the main theoretical approaches describing the dvcs process . from the perturbative qcd point of view , gpds have been studied extensively and incorporate the partonic and distributional behavior .",
    "they are two - parton correlation functions that allow accessing parton correlations within hadrons . for fixed skewedness , they are continuous functions and cover two distinct regions , the dglap and the erbl regions , in which their evolution with the hard scale is driven by the corresponding evolution equations",
    ". moreover , the lorentz structure of the gpds implies a polynomiality condition ; namely , their @xmath15-th moments are polynomials in the square of the skewedness of degree smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "the most promising approach for gpd parameterisations relies on setting them equal to the forward pdfs using a forward model with suitably symmetrized input gpds in the erbl region constructed in order to satisfy polynomiality for the first two momenta  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical studies reproduce satisfactorily the main features of dvcs data  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a simple and intuitive high energy formalism has recently been used to describe dvcs  @xcite .",
    "it is given by a colour dipole picture , which allows extending in the studies of saturation physics at low virtualities of the incoming photon .",
    "this is an advantage in comparison with the pqcd formalism which is limited by the initial scale for qcd evolution to the order of @xmath17 gev .",
    "additionally , the roles played by qcd evolution and skewing effects have been recently shown in the scope of this formalism .",
    "the off - diagonal effect has been investigated through a simple phenomenological parameterisation .",

    "+ in this work , we will address the question of the extraction of the skewing correction using the available data on dis and dvcs .",
    "this can be performed by computing the ratio of the imaginary parts of the amplitudes for these reactions .",
    "the skewing factor @xmath18 will depend on the experimental measurements and therefore possess a small degree of model dependence .",
    "we therefore have the attractive possibility in determining its dependence upon @xmath6 virtuality and upon @xmath8 energy .",
    "this knowledge will enable us to gain insight into the skewedness correction to the non - forward observables .",
    "namely , the non - forward cross section and distributions can be easily obtained from the forward ones by simply multiplying them by the skewing factor .",
    "this has direct implications in computing the exclusive meson and heavy boson production via the forward scattering amplitude , which is better constrained from the inclusive measurements .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows ; in the next section , the skewing factor @xmath18 is defined and extracted from experimental desy - hera results on dis and dvcs . in section  [ sec : pred ] we perform a comparison of the skewing factor with two different theoretical approaches , the perturbative nlo qcd calculation and the colour dipole formalism . a qualitative analysis of the extracted skewing factor",
    "is then performed in a colour dipole approach . in the last section",
    "we summarize the main results and discussions .",
    "lets define a basic quantity giving an overall measurement of the skewing properties , which includes both the non - forward kinematics and the non - diagonal effects .",
    "namely , we set the ratio between the imaginary parts of the dis and dvcs ( forward ) scattering amplitudes at zero momentum transfer : r  , [ r_def ] where @xmath19 is the square of the four - momentum exchanged at the proton vertex . + the scattering amplitude for the dis process can be directly obtained from the dis cross section and experimentally measured at desy - hera , that is @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , the dis amplitude can be written down using the usual pqcd fits for the proton structure function , @xmath21 .",
    "the dvcs scattering amplitude can be obtained from the recent measurements on the deeply virtual compton scattering cross section . in this case , the @xmath19 dependence of the amplitude can be assumed to be factorised out and parameterised as an exponential , @xmath22 , and the total dvcs cross section can be related to the corresponding amplitude at @xmath23 ; namely , @xmath24 ^ 2}{16\\pi\\,b}\\ , , \\label{dvcs_xs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the @xmath19 slope parameter referred to above .",

    "( [ dvcs_xs ] ) by a factor @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the dvcs amplitude .",
    "the typical contribution for the kinematic window available at hera is of the order of 20 % . in particular , to a good approximation , @xmath27 can be calculated using dispersion relations to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the effective power of the bjorken @xmath30 dependence of the imaginary part of the amplitude . for an estimate of the real part contribution we use the effective power for the inclusive deep inelastic reaction taken from ref .",
