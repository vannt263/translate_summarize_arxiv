    "over the last decade exquisite observations of several cosmological probes ( e.g. type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) @xcite ) has led the emergence of the so - called standard model in cosmology , known as the @xmath0cdm model , and the determination of cosmological parameters with a precision of a few percent . however , the nature of the basic components of the model , the cold dark matter and the cosmological constant , is still unknown and there are a large variety of alternatives  @xcite .    of these observables ,",
    "light from sne ia probe the fully non - linear regime because they traverse structure over large distances with a beam which is very narrow .",
    "the distance to the snia is affected by the usual weak lensing of large - scale structure , an effect which is now being detected  @xcite . what is the full effect of inhomogeneities along the line of sight to an snia ?",
    "ray - tracing techniques were applied to cosmological n - body simulations to analyze the magnitude of the effects of the inhomogeneities and found small deviations @xcite , implying that the inhomogeneities are compensated along the line of sight . if this assumption is relaxed , very different results are achieved . if light travels preferentially through an underdense medium , as it seems to be the case in the web structure we see , different distances are derived .",
    "this point was raised by bolejko @xcite and meures & bruni @xcite . moreover , in the case that some lines of sight are blocked due to opaque structures of high density , underdense lines would be preferred @xcite .",
    "the size of the light beam is the key issue . for beams with sizes on arcminute scales , the dispersion in the hubble diagram due to matter fluctuations",
    "can be corrected @xcite due to the shearing of images . as a supernova beam has an angular size of @xmath1 @xmath2 arcsec at a redshift @xmath3 ,",
    "this correction can not be applied , since shear maps are smoothed on arcminute scales @xcite . furthermore , the typical size of a beam in an n - body simulation is around hundreds of kiloparsecs , while a supernova has 1 a.u . size ( @xmath4kpc ) .",
    "non - linear terms in the mean magnification must be considered , which can shift the mean by a non - negligible amount .",
    "this is extremely dependent on the matter distribution along the line of sight on scales not covered by perturbation theory or in n - body simulations .",
    "in particular , perturbation theory predicts a variance which diverges as the beam size becomes small which means it loses predictive power  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that narrowing the beam size in n - body simulations shifts the probability distribution function dramatically , implying that most narrow beams probe very underdense lines of sight which are compensated by relatively few of high density .",
    "of course , these simulations can only probe beam sizes which are many of orders of magnitude larger than required , so one can only speculate as to the actual probability distribution function .    given this uncertainty in knowing the correct distribution function to use",
    ", there is uncertainty in modelling the magnification of such narrow beams , which relies on the matter density and expansion rate along the beam . in this paper",
    "we follow an observational approach . we choose four different approximations to probe inhomogeneities with observations @xcite .",
    "three of them can change the cosmological parameters by several percent : the dyer ",
    "roeder ( dr ) approximation @xcite , the weak lensing approximation with uncompensated density along the line of sight @xcite , and the flux - averaging approximation @xcite .",
    "we also propose a new approximation which takes into account the different expansion rates along the line of sight .    in our analyses we use two samples of sne ia .",
    "the first is the union2.1 compilation data @xcite , comprising 580 sne ia calibrated with the salt2 light curve fitter @xcite . in this sample",
    "we add a high - redshift supernova scp-0401 detected at @xmath5 by rubin _",
    "_ @xcite . for convenience",
    ", we call the set of 581 sne as the union2.1 compilation data .",
    "the second sample comprises 288 sne ia of the first - year sloan digital sky survey ii @xcite , where we consider the data calibrated with the mlcs2k2 light curve fitter @xcite .",
    "we call this sample the sdss compilation data .    a possible way to disentangle the effects of the inhomogeneities is to consider joint analyses with a sample with a different degeneracy in the parameter space .",
    "so , we also consider 19 @xmath6 measurements from differential age of passively evolving galaxies @xcite . in order to deal with a tension between different measurements of the hubble constant @xmath7",
    ", we also consider two measurements for @xmath7 : @xmath8 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 @xcite , where the latter is in agreement with the latest measurement from _ planck _ @xcite .",

    "[ sec_th ] the different approximations to deal with the light propagation are presented . in sec .",

    "[ sec_conc ] with the conclusions .",
    "in this section we give a brief overview of light propagation in a generic spacetime .",
    "the idea is to derive the sachs optical equations @xcite used in the derivation of the approximations discussed in the next section .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for detailed explanations .    to describe light propagation the geometric optics approximation @xcite is assumed .",
    "light rays are bundles of irrotational null geodesics @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the affine parameter and @xmath13 labels the geodesics , so the tangent vector @xmath14 obeys    @xmath15}=0 . \\label{nullgeod}\\ ] ]    the connecting vector @xmath16 which links neighbouring geodesics and gives the physical shape of the bundle satisfies the geodesic deviation equation    @xmath17    we can project the above equation in a screen space orthogonal to the ray direction as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the screen projection of the riemann tensor , and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) are unit vectors spanning the screen space .",
    "@xmath22 can be decomposed in the following way    @xmath23    with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is called the ricci focusing and @xmath27 is called the weyl focusing .",
    "the former is generated by matter inside the beam while the latter is generated by matter outside the beam that induces a non - vanising weyl tensor inside the beam .",
    "we can manipulate eq .",
    "( [ eq_eta ] ) and express it as a function of the optical scalars @xmath28 and @xmath29 , called the null expansion and the null shear respectively , which gives the sachs equations @xcite    @xmath30    the null expansion is related to the cross - sectional area @xmath31 of the light rays as @xcite    @xmath32    since the angular diameter distance @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath34 , we obtain    @xmath35    a last step is needed before we move to particular approximations , which is the transformation of the affine parameter @xmath12 to the observable redshift @xmath36 . for observers with four - velocity @xmath37 , the redshift is given by    @xmath38    this implies that @xcite    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the observed expansion rate along the line of sight and @xmath41 is the spatial direction of observation . from these equations we see that assumptions must be specified about the matter distribution and the expansion rate along the line of sight .",
    "we now focus our attention to four approximations that try to take into account the effects of the inhomogeneities .",
    "as they have different premisses it is interesting to see how cosmological parameters are affected by them .",
    "let us describe them starting with the dr approximation .",
    "the dr approximation @xcite assumes that light can propagate preferentially by underdense lines of sight .",
    "this fact , first noted by zeldovich @xcite , is incorporated in the model through the introduction of the smoothness parameter @xmath42 in @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath44 we have the same amount of matter as in the homogeneous case , so it is called the filled beam . in the other extreme , if light propagates in vacuum we have @xmath45 , which is the empty beam . therefore , for a partial clumping , the smoothness parameter varies between 0 and 1 .",
    "the approximation also requires that the shear is zero and the expansion along the line of sight is the same as in the homogeneous case ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "in short , the dr approximation states that light propagates in a homogeneous universe with less matter inside the beam which is redistributed to clumps .",
    "it is based in the fact that the probability of a typical line of sight to encounter a high - mass halo is low and if this happens strong lensing can occur , and the supernova would be removed of the statistical analysis , or the supernova is blocked and we would not see it .",
    "so , it is a simple way to quantify a possible bias in the statistical analyses using sne ia .    adopting these assumptions and restricting our attention to a flat @xmath0cdm model ( see @xcite for the influence of a quintessence fluid ) , we derive the dr equation    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the matter density parameter today and the redshift dependence of @xmath42 encodes the fact that we expect the universe to be more homogeneous in the past @xcite .    in order to compare this approximation with the sne ia data , the relation between the luminosity distance and the angular diameter distance @xmath49 is used , which is known as the etherington principle @xcite . writing in terms of the adimensional luminosity distance @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the speed of light , we have    @xmath52    which satisfies the initial conditions @xmath53 the terms @xmath54 , @xmath55 end @xmath56 are functions of the cosmological parameters , expressed in terms of the redshift by    @xmath57\\omega_{\\rm m }   + 2(1-\\omega_{\\rm m})(1+z)^{-3}.",
    "\\\\ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the dr approximation has been criticized by some authors .",
    "the first came from photon flux conversation put forward by weinberg @xcite , where divergence from underdense regions are compensated by convergence of clumpy regions .",
    "the question remains open , since following works arrived at different conclusions @xcite .",
    "more recently , rsnen @xcite questioned the dr approximation , but relied that the density along the line of sight is compensated and there are no selection effects , which are not necessarily the case @xcite .",
    "in fact , a method was developed in @xcite to take into account the blocked lines of sight , where halos above a minimum threshold do not allow light beams to cross them . as a result ,",
    "one ends up with a specific form for @xmath58 given by the matter not locked in clumps . as the universe was more homogeneous in the past",
    ", a smaller deviation compared to the standar dr model is derived .",
    "therefore , we will keep our attention to the standard , and most extreme , dr approximation .",
    "the weak lensing approximation considers perturbations to a homogeneous background where the line element in newtonian gauge is    @xmath59,\\ ] ]    @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the bardeen potentials .",
    "the angular diameter distance in this case is @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the homogeneous angular diameter distance and @xmath64 is the negative of convergence given as an integral of the homogeneous distance and the perturbed potentials .",
    "recently , bolejko @xcite found out a relation between the weak lensing and dr approximations , firstly discussed by futamase and sasaki @xcite .",
    "they provide the same results when the smoothness parameter has the following form    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the mean of density fluctuations along the line of sight .    in this formulation",
    ", the standard weak lensing approach predicts that the inhomogeneities are compensated along the line of sight and @xmath66 is of order @xmath67 .",
    "however , that is not necessarily the case , since the density fluctuations are not randomly distributed but form a cosmic web . in this case the value of @xmath66 can be much higher and very different distances would be derived . from now on we consider light travelling in an underdense medium so that @xmath68 , and we constrain the modulus of it .",
    "note that light travelling in overdense medium is possible and was preferred by union2 compilation data @xcite as shown in @xcite for an extended dr approximation , but a correspondence with weak lensing is not available yet .",
    "the flux - averaging approximation was developed by wang and collaborators @xcite and it is based on the flux conservation of gravitational lensing as emphasized by weinberg @xcite .",
    "the idea is that considering a large number of standard candles in the same redshift , the average magnification is one . in this way",
    ", the process should reduce the bias produced by gravitational lensing .",
    "however , note that effects due to blocked lines of sight or uncompensated lines of sight in average are not contemplated in this method .    in this method",
    "the errors are suposed to be gaussian in flux , not in magnitudes .",
    "the flux - averaging method minimizes the @xmath69 in a model - dependent way .",
    "here , we present how to flux - average for uncorrelated errors .",
    "first , one needs to convert the observed magnitude into `` fluxes '' @xmath70    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the observed magnitude and @xmath73 is the measured distance .",
    "the next step is to remove the redshift dependence , for a set of cosmological parameters @xmath74 , by defining the `` absolute luminosities '' \\{@xmath75 }    @xmath76    for each redshift bin @xmath77 , the flux - average for the absolute luminosities @xmath78 in the mean redshift @xmath79 is    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the number of bins .",
    "therefore , the binned flux in the @xmath77-th redshift bin is    @xmath82    the statistical analysis is done now with    @xmath83 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{f , i}^2},\\ ] ]    where the errors @xmath84 are the root mean square of the unbinned errors divided by the square root of the number of points in each bin .",
    "one criticism to the standard dr approach is that the change in the focusing due to less matter inside the beam must be compensated to curvature and shear terms in order to provide the same local expansion rate as in the homogeneous case @xcite , what is not expected physically .",
    "thus , one way to improve the modelling is to allow a different expansion rate along the line of sight .",
    "there are several possibilities to implement that , but for simplicity we use only one function , a modified smoothness parameter @xmath85 , to describe the effect .",
    "we write the hubble parameter along the line of sight as    @xmath86 ^\\frac{1}{2 } ,    \\label{hubblezfrw2}\\ ] ]    where an extra curvature term appears because light propagates in an underdense medium which expands faster . we consider a constant smoothness parameter which provides the highest difference from the standard flat @xmath0cdm case . for different approaches",
    "see @xcite .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ hubblezfrw2 ] ) is considered only for the sne light beams propagating on average in an underdense medium .",
    "observations which infer the averaged @xmath6 , as it is the case for the cosmic chronometers data , must be compared to the usual homogeneous hubble parameter .",
    "+   +   +    in this section we perform statistical analyses to constrain the parameters of the models described above . in order to have a broad coverage of different observational probes ,",
    "two samples of sne ia are considered calibrated with different light curve fitters . the first is constituted of 581 sne ia from @xcite , the union2.1 compilation data calibrated with salt2 @xcite .",
    "the second sample has 288 sne ia calibrated with the mlcs2k2 fitter @xcite called the sdss sample .    except for the flux - averaging scheme , the set of parameters @xmath87 are constrained by maximizing the posterior probability , which is equivalent , for gaussianly distributed measurements , to minimize the @xmath69 function @xmath88 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the theoretical distance modulus",
    ", @xmath90 is the observed distance modulus and @xmath91 its respective uncertainty . we treat @xmath7 as a nuisance parameter and we marginalize over it .",

    "this sample was used to constrain several cosmological parameters in @xcite , and in addition with @xmath6 from bao measurements to investigate dark energy models @xcite .",
    "we do not use the @xmath6 from bao measurements since it is not clear how the inhomogeneities can affect such measurements .",
    "although expected to be small due to the inference from large scales where the effects may average out , we decided to be more conservative .",
    "the statistical analyses follow as the same for sne ia , with the @xmath69 given by    @xmath92 ^ 2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath93 is the theoretical hubble parameter , @xmath94 is the observed hubble parameter , and @xmath95 its respective uncertainty . again",
    ", we marginalize over @xmath7 with a gaussian prior following ref . @xcite .    in order to deal with a tension between measurements of @xmath7 , two values are used in the analyses .",
    "the first is based on _ hubble space telescope _ measurements : @xmath96 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the second is based on a median statistics analysis of 553 values for @xmath7 : @xmath97 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the last value is in agreement with the latest measurement from _",
    "planck _ @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a)-(c ) we display the results of the statistical analyses considering 581 from the union2.1 compilation data @xcite , 19 @xmath6 measurements @xcite and @xmath7(cr ) @xcite for a flat @xmath0cdm model .",
    "it is shown that the smoothness parameter is weakly constrained with sne ia data and the addition of the @xmath6 measurements do not improve the limits due to the degeneracy of the data in the parameter space .",
    "for the sne ia data only , the parameters are constrained to be in the intervals within the 95.4% confidence level @xmath98 : @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "as expected , the @xmath6 can only improve the constraints through a joint analysis @xcite , since the expansion rate in the dr approximation is the same of a homogeneous model .",
    "the restrictions obtained in the joint analysis are : @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xmath98 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d)-(f ) it is shown the results when a higher value for @xmath7(r ) @xcite is considered . in this case",
    "the @xmath6 constraints are slightly shifted to the left allowing better constraints to @xmath42 in the joint analysis , which provides @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xmath98 .    at this point it is interesting to compare these results with previous analyses . our results are fully compatible with constraints based on analyses involving sne ia , compact radio sources , gamma - ray bursts and @xmath6 measurements @xcite . the same trend noticed in @xcite remains , where a larger sample of sne ia weakens the constraints over the smoothness parameter .",
    "shortly , the dr approximation can handle with all observations so far .",
    "on the other hand , the results are not in agreement with a recent analysis involving sne ia , gamma - ray bursts and @xmath6 measurements @xcite .",
    "so , it is necessary to understand the difference between their results and ours .",
    "first of all , our sne ia constraints are very different , although we added only one high - redshift supernova .",
    "we ascribe this difference possibly by a lack of convergence in their mcmc analysis , which is in general problematic when the best fit is near the borders of the considered interval .",
    "note that @xmath44 is only allowed at @xmath105 ( their table iii ) , which is the cosmic concordance model .",
    "second , as emphasized in @xcite , the @xmath6 measurements are completely independent of @xmath42 , since in the dr approximation light propagates in a universe with local density @xmath106 , but the same expansion rate of a perfectly homogeneous universe .",
    "thus , their equation ( 22 ) is not valid . actually , it is the breakdown of this equation which turns possible to use consistency tests @xcite to see whether the effects of the inhomogeneities in light propagation are significant @xcite .",
    "to finish , although the use of gamma - ray bursts may give a lever arm in the hubble diagram to discern among cosmological models , caution is needed , since the understanding of the phenomenological relations used to calibrate them is still incipient .",
    ".limits to @xmath42 and @xmath48 in the dr approximation .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      now we compare how the different approximations impact other cosmological parameters , in our case @xmath48 .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the results for the four different approximations and also when the inhomogeneities are neglected , the standard case . in fig .",
    "[ fig : first_fig15 ] the results for the union2.1 compilation data @xcite are shown .",
    "the behavior for the dr , the weak lensing , and the modified dr approximations are expected .",
    "we see that all of them allow higher values for @xmath48 . as the combination @xmath107",
    "is constrained , considering values such that @xmath108 implies higher values for @xmath48 . on the other hand",
    ", the flux - averaging approximation prefers lower values for @xmath48 . in general , regardless the approximation considered , the posteriors are broader , which implies larger errors in @xmath48 .",
    "these errors are not negligible , but do not put a severe problem to the standard model at this moment .",
    "however , they can have a larger impact in joint analyses , since the intersection in the parameter space may be different .",
    "figure [ fig : second_fig15 ] shows the comparison for the different approximations with the sdss compilation data @xcite .",
    "the dr , the weak lensing , and the modified dr approximations showed the same pattern , where higher values for @xmath48 are compatible with the data compared to the standard case . in the case of the flux - averaging approximation ,",
    "much lower values were derived compared to the union2.1 compilation data @xcite .",
    "it is this shift which turns possible that this approximation to be compatible with the @xmath6 measurements @xcite .    while the effects discussed here can not change our whole view about the way cosmological data are interpreted , the trend is they become more and more important due to several planned and ongoing surveys which will discover thousands of supernovae",
    "we have investigated the effects of small - scale inhomogeneities in light propagation of narrow beams in different approximations . we have studied four approximations , the dr approximation @xcite , the weak lensing approximation @xcite , the flux - averaging approximation @xcite , and a modified dr approximation .",
    "we used the 581 sne ia from the union2.1 compilation data @xcite , 288 sne ia from the sdss compilation data @xcite , 19 @xmath6 measurements and two values for @xmath7 @xcite .    for the union2.1 compilation data",
    "@xcite all approximations are in agreement with observational data .",
    "basically , the approximations incur in higher errors for the matter density parameter @xmath48 .",
    "although the difference from the perfectly homogeneous case is not catastrophic , the effects must be important in order to achieve accurate results .",
    "on the other hand , the 288 sne ia from the sdss compilation data @xcite prefers more exotic models compared to @xmath0cdm @xcite .",
    "so we have analyzed the effects of the inhomogeneities in this sample together with @xmath6 measurements @xcite and two values for @xmath7 @xcite in order to see whether a better agreement between different samples can be obtained . for the dr , the weak lensing , and the modified dr approximations the tension remains ,",
    "although it can be slightly alleviated for higher values for @xmath7 .",
    "however , as the flux - averaging approximation provides lower values for @xmath48 , the tension disappears irrespective of the value of @xmath7 considered in the marginalization .",
    "in summary , the non - linear effects of the inhomogeneities in narrow beams , in addition to bias and selection effects may play an important role in the estimation of cosmological parameters , as well as the determination of the nature of dark energy or a need to introduce a different gravitational theory on large scales .",
    "therefore , efforts in modelling such effects together with observational scrutiny are vital to build a consistent picture of the universe .",
