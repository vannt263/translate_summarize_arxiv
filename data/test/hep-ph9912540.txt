    "recently a program has been proposed to study neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "this program is based on the following assumptions .    * assumption 1 : * there are three right - handed dirac neutrinos in addition to the three known left - handed neutrinos .",
    "* assumption 2 : * the lepton mass matrices have the same structure as the quark mass matrices , as described by lehmann _",
    "_ @xcite .    in carrying out this program ,",
    "one of the technically most difficult aspects is to treat the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect for the sun @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to discuss this problem .",
    "the difficulty arises in the following way . on the basis of the super - kamiokande data on atmospheric neutrinos @xcite , the muon neutrino @xmath0 oscillates with another neutrino which is not the electron neutrino @xmath1 . from assumption  1",
    ", this neutrino must be the tau neutrino @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , @xmath0 and @xmath2 are coupled significantly . again from assumption  1 , the electron neutrinos @xmath1 from the sun",
    "must therefore oscillate with either @xmath0 or @xmath2 . since",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath2 are coupled significantly , the electron neutrinos @xmath1 from the sun must oscillate with _ both _",
    "@xmath0 _ and _ @xmath2 .",
    "it is accordingly necessary to understand the msw effect with all three generations of neutrinos @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 .    while there is an extensive literature on the msw effect for two generations of neutrinos @xcite , relatively little",
    "is known for the case of three generations @xcite .",
    "one of the major differences between these two cases is the following . for two generations ,",
    "the msw effect occurs predominantly in the vicinity of a particular density in the sun .",
    "for this reason , the important parameter is the rate of change of the density at this particular density .",
    "in contrast , for three generations , the important contributions to the msw effect can come from several regions . when the parameters , such as the neutrino masses , vary , these regions not only move but also merge and separate , features that are absent for the much simpler case of two generations .",
    "there are many different ways to formulate the problem of the msw @xcite effect in the sun for three generations of neutrinos .",
    "these different formulations are of course closely related to each other ; it has been found that , at least for the present program @xcite , the following one is most appropriate .    in a current basis , the charged lepton currents are @xmath3 where @xmath4 \\quad { \\rm and } \\quad \\ell=\\left[\\tighten\\matrix { \\ell_1 \\cr \\ell_2 \\cr \\ell_3\\cr}\\right]\\ ] ] denote the neutrino and charged lepton fields .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix @xmath5 @xcite , from the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field in the neutrino - higgs coupling , is @xmath6    let @xmath7 be the momentum of the neutrino , the value of which is taken to be much larger than the neutrino masses , which are the eigenvalues of @xmath5 .",
    "typically , @xmath7 is in the range from 0.4  mev/@xmath8 to 10  mev/@xmath8 , while the neutrino masses are believed to be no more than about 1  ev ; hence this assumption is well satisfied . under this assumption , it is @xmath9 that enters in the msw effect .",
    "let @xmath10\\ ] ] be real and symmetric .",
    "note that @xmath11 are not defined , only @xmath12 .",
    "of course the eigenvalues of this matrix @xmath9 are the squares of the neutrino masses .    in terms of this @xmath9 ,",
    "the msw effect for neutrino oscillations is described by the coupled ordinary differential equation @xcite @xmath13 = \\left ( \\left[\\tighten\\matrix { d(r ) & 0 & 0\\cr 0 & 0 & 0\\cr 0 & 0 & 0\\cr}\\right ] + \\frac{1}{2p } \\left[\\tighten\\matrix { m^2_{11 } & m^2_{12 } & m^2_{13}\\cr m^2_{21 } & m^2_{22 } & m^2_{23}\\cr m^2_{31 } & m^2_{32 } & m^2_{33 } \\cr}\\right ] \\right ) \\left[\\tighten\\matrix { \\phi_1(r)\\cr \\phi_2(r)\\cr \\phi_3(r ) \\cr}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath14 with @xmath15 the fermi weak - interaction constant and @xmath16 the electron density at the point @xmath17 .",
    "so far this formulation is general . in view of the observation in sec .",
    "i that , for three generations of neutrinos , important contributions to the msw effect can come from several values of @xmath17 , we propose to choose a suitable function @xmath18 .",
    "on the one hand , this @xmath18 should describe approximately the electron density in the sun ; on the other hand , this @xmath18 should be sufficiently simple so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : schr-1 ] ) can be solved explicitly .",
    "this choice is made in the following way .",
    "first , since most neutrinos are produced by nuclear reactions @xcite near the center of the sun , the simplifying assumption is made that the neutrinos are produced at the center of the sun .",
    "this has the consequence that the @xmath17 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : schr-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : define - d ] ) is the radial distance from the center of the sun .",
    "this is the reason for the notation @xmath17 .    secondly , the density of the sun as a function of the radial distance is fairly accurately known @xcite , as shown by the solid curve in fig .  1 , where the vertical axis is the density in g/@xmath19 in a logarithmic scale , and the horizontal axis is @xmath20 . the radius of the sun is @xmath21 from this solid curve in fig .",
    "1 , it is seen that the solar density is approximately exponential , as shown by the dotted line of fig .  1 .",
    "this fit is reasonably good , to an accuracy of roughly 15% , for @xmath22 in other words , @xmath18 is taken to be given by @xmath23    [ fig : rho ]    ( 12,7.5 ) ( 2.0,1.0 )    from the dotted line of fig .  1 ,",
    "the following values are obtained @xmath24 the problem is therefore to solve the msw differential equation , for @xmath25 , @xmath26 = \\frac{1}{2p } \\left[\\tighten\\matrix { 2pd(0)e^{-r / r_0}+m^2_{11 } & m^2_{12 } & m^2_{13}\\cr m^2_{21 } & m^2_{22 } & m^2_{23}\\cr m^2_{31 } & m^2_{32 } & m^2_{33 } \\cr}\\right ] \\left[\\tighten\\matrix { \\phi_1(r)\\cr",
