    "a generic prediction of cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology is the existence of a significant amount of substructure in gravitationally collapsed structures such as galaxy clusters , galaxy halos and even dwarf galaxies @xcite . on the scale of large spiral galaxies like the milky way , some 500 dense clumps are expected to orbit in the halo .",
    "these structures have very dense cores , with a very steep radial profile of universal shape ( increasing as @xmath1 or @xmath2 in the central regions , @xcite ) , which renders them essentially impervious to galactic tides .",
    "the current `` dark matter crisis '' stems from the difference between these predictions and observations of low - mass galaxies .",
    "the first problem is that rotation curves of gas - rich low - mass disk galaxies are not as peaked as required by cdm .",
    "@xcite suggested that this disagreement could be due to an error in the analysis of hi observations , in which the beam - smearing effect of extant hi radial velocity curves had not been taken into account .",
    "however , this appears not to be the case , as recent ( high spatial resolution ) @xmath3 rotation curves have shown @xcite .",
    "a second fundamental problem also exists : the mass of the cdm substructures in a galaxy - sized halo is similar to that inferred for galaxy satellites , yet the number of cdm substructures in a galaxy - sized halo is much larger than the number of observed dwarf galaxies@xcite .",
    "it is , of course , possible that these galaxies have a quite different non - cosmological origin ( perhaps due to tidal interactions in the early universe ) . in either case",
    "the problem remains : where is the population of 500 cdm substructures orbiting the milky way and other large galaxies ?",
    "recently , several studies have investigated the effect of reioninzation on the early evolution of small structures @xcite .",
    "this re - ionizing radiation sets in at a redshift @xmath4@xmath5 , and originates from either the first stars or quasars .",
    "indeed , the first direct evidence for reionization ( at @xmath6 ) has recently been found @xcite .",
    "the intergalactic and galactic mediums are ionized by this radiation , and any gas that is not in deep potential wells is lost from the protogalaxies .",
    "the limiting mass for maintaining a gas component appears to correspond to a circular velocity of @xmath7 , well above the circular velocity of all the dwarf spheroidal galaxies known .",
    "( however , it may be possible for low - mass systems to maintain a gas - fraction if the gas managed to cool to dense molecular form before the epoch of reionization ) .",
    "this `` squelching '' of star - formation in low - mass galaxies neatly solves the cdm satellite over - production problem .    a potential candidate for the missing dwarf systems that are supposed to inhabit",
    "the galactic halo is the large population of high velocity clouds that pepper the sky ( see wakker 2001 for a recent review ) . with little or no stellar content ,",
    "these are seen to possess velocities incompatible with galactic rotation models , although @xcite have shown that the kinematic characteristics of the velocities of the clouds are compatible with them being members of an accreting population distributed within a megaparsec of the milky way . at these distances ,",
    "the kinematic signatures of the clouds imply a mass - to - light ratio of 10 - 50 @xcite .",
    "currently , their distances are extremely difficult to determine , with complex a being the only system to which the distance , of between 4 and 10kpc , has been measured @xcite . with the promise of accurate distances from @xmath3 @xcite",
    ", a full appraisal of the nature of high velocity clouds and their relation to the formation of the milky way can be made ; but a preliminary analysis suggests that the clouds are scattered in the galactic halo @xcite , and are not of cosmological origin .    nevertheless , cdm theory predicts that a large population of completely or almost completely dark `` galaxies '' should be present in the milky way .",
    "here we propose an observational test of this scenario . in the early galaxy ,",
    "many globular clusters are expected to have surrounded the milky way .",
    "galactic tidal forces have been destroying these objects @xcite , and of the initial population of a few hundred objects , only @xmath8 remain , and many of these show signs of tidal disruption @xcite .    in a static potential ,",
    "as a low - mass stellar system , such as a globular cluster , loses progressively more and more mass to tidal forces , it develops long tidal tails that closely follow the orbit of the globular cluster .",
    "( in the limit of a zero mass system , the tidal stream exactly follows the progenitor orbit ) . here",
    "we explore how the presence of the population of dark matter clumps predicted by cdm alters the phase - space structure of a globular cluster tidal stream .",
    "for the special case when the global galactic potential is nearly spherical , this corresponds to a broadening of the stream from a thin great - circle stream into a wide band on the sky . in a companion paper ( @xcite ;",
    "paper  2 ) , we use these results to motivate the search for tidal streams in the 2  micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) dataset .    other ways to probe the dark matter substructure have been proposed .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite suggested that substructure in external galaxies may be detected through their gravitational lensing of background quasars , as a lumpy halo will produce image and brightness configurations different to a smooth matter halo .",
    "while such an approach may reveal any missing sub - halos , the method is subject to the vagaries of gravitational lens modeling . during the final preparation of this work",
    ", @xcite presented a study investigating the signatures that are imprinted by different dark matter models on tidal streams of dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "they find that the structure and kinematics of the outer regions of dwarf galaxies can also allow one to differentiate between dark matter models .",
    "our aim is to quantify the difference in the structure of the tidal tail of an ancient globular cluster ( or even an ancient globular cluster remnant ) if the galactic halo has a smooth mass distribution compared to the case when the halo also contains significant substructure .",
    "we have modelled the smooth components of the galaxy as fixed potentials , using the galactic mass model of @xcite , which contains a disk , thick disk , interstellar medium , bulge , spheroid and halo components .",
    "the parameters of this model are detailed in @xcite .",
    "the halo was taken to have a mass normalization that gives a total model circular velocity of @xmath9 at @xmath10 .",
    "the mass flattening of the potential was left as a free parameter @xmath11 .",
    "we adapted the fast parallel code pkdgrav to include the forces due to these mass distributions by including a multipole expansion code kindly supplied by w. dehnen .",
    "in all the following simulations we maintained accurate forces by using an opening angle of @xmath12 and expanding the cell moments to hexadecapole order .",
    "two body relaxation was suppressed by using a spline softening of 10 pc , such that the inter - particle forces are completely newtonian at 20 pc .",
    "a variable time - step scheme is used based on the local acceleration , @xmath13 , and density , @xmath14 , with the accuracy parameter @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "typically we used 100000 base steps to integrate 12 gyr . with the variable time - steps , this was equivalent to taking @xmath16 time - steps .",
    "the initial globular cluster was modelled with a king model @xcite , populated with @xmath17 particles .",
    "the total mass of the globular cluster was taken to be @xmath0 , the model had concentration parameter @xmath18 and central velocity dispersion @xmath19 , yielding a tidal radius of @xmath20 .",
    "this model is of approximately the same size and mass as omega centauri , but of lower concentration ( by a factor of @xmath21 ) .",
    "note that we are not aiming at presenting an accurate model of the disruption of a globular cluster  we do not have sufficient resolution for that  instead , here we seek to study the kinematic behaviour of the unbound tidal streams that emerge from disrupting low - mass systems .",
    "the initial position and systemic velocity of the king model were randomly chosen from the halo component of a galaxy model @xcite that gives a similar rotation curve to the adopted dehnen & binney mass model .",
    "integrating the globular cluster models for @xmath22 in the smooth potential gives rise to very narrow tidal tails .",
    "an example of one of these models is shown in figure  1 , which displays the position , heliocentric radial velocity and distance distribution of the stream particles . at its narrowest ,",
    "the width of this stream is @xmath23 , similar in width to the tidal radius of the initial king model , while at its widest , the stream is @xmath24 wide .",
    "the shape of the halo mass distribution for the simulation displayed in figure  1 is spherical , @xmath25 , which is motivated by recent analyses of the outer halo of the milky way @xcite .",
    "for each one of these models , we also investigate the effect of the presence of a large number of moving substructures in the halo .",
    "however , we first need a realistic way of modeling these substructures . according to navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) ( hereafter nfw ) , and other authors ,",
    "galaxy halos have a `` universal '' density profile @xmath26 , which fits all scales currently probed by the numerical cosmology simulations .",
    "the potential corresponding to this density profile is very simple : @xmath27 , and the forces due to this potential would be straight - forward to add in to our n - body integrator .",
    "unfortunately , however , this density profile is not well - behaved either at small or at large radii ( the total mass diverges ) ; to fix these problems , the force near the center of the sub - halo would need to be softened , and the density would have to be made to fall off to zero at some large radius ( the tidal radius of the substructure would be a good choice ) .",
    "a simpler solution is to approximate the nfw profiles with a softened point - mass potential .",
    "figure  2 compares the radial acceleration due to an nfw potential ( dotted line ) , a kepler potential ( dashed line ) , and a softened kepler potential ( solid line ) with spline softening of @xmath28 times the scale radius @xmath29 of the nfw profile .",
    "note that , at all radii , this softened point - mass potential underestimates the forces compared to the nfw potential .",
    "the substructures are added into the galactic halo as softened point masses , with a distribution of sub - halo masses that follows a relation @xmath30 ( our parameterization of figure  2 of @xcite ) . at the low - mass end of this distribution",
    ", there are 435 sub - halos of circular velocity @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the halo mass fraction in this lumpy component is relatively small , as it accounts for less than @xmath5% of the mass of the smooth halo .",
    "the initial positions and velocities of the particles representing the sub - halos are also chosen from the halo component of the @xcite galaxy model , but with a pericenter cutoff of @xmath33 , since dynamical friction will likely make the orbits of dark satellites with smaller pericenter radii decay quickly .",
    "the effect of these numerous dark matter clumps is marked : in figure  3 we show the position , velocity and distance distribution of the tidal stream particles . in this simulation , only 1% of the mass of the halo is not in the smooth component , yet the tidal stream has been substantially heated and is substantially wider than in the smooth halo ( the stream is so fluffy that it is difficult to measure a width ) .    a better way to look at the simulations is in the space of the integrals of the motion . in the axisymmetric potentials considered here , the integrals are the total energy per unit mass @xmath34 and the @xmath35 component of angular momentum per unit mass @xmath36 .",
    "it is also useful to inspect the total angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath37 , which is an approximate integral of the motion in the relatively spherical potentials we consider here .",
    "figure  4 shows the relation between these three quantities . the top row of figure  4",
    "is derived from the simulation of the globular cluster model in the smooth spherical halo whose structure on the sky was previously displayed in figure  1 .",
    "after @xmath38 the particles have remained localised in the space of the integrals of the motion . the bottom panel shows the same globular cluster model on the same orbit , but simulated in the halo model that contains the additional nfw sub - halos ( corresponding to the simulation shown in figure  3 ) . in this lumpier potential , the globular cluster stream is comparatively much more dispersed , especially in the @xmath36 parameter .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "dispersion in @xmath36 is a factor of 5 larger in the lumpy halo simulation .",
    "inspecting the spatial distribution of particles can be useful for differentiating between a smooth and lumpy halo when the mass distribution is spherical ( or close to spherical ) .",
    "however , in a flattened halo , differential precession mimics the effect of heating by cdm clumps , and it becomes impossible to differentiate between the two causes of spatial dispersion of the stream .",
    "it is only when viewing the space of the integrals of the motion that the effect of precession decouples from the stochastic heating by the cdm clumps .",
    "we have repeated the same experiments as above in a flattened halo , with @xmath39 , a flattening value predicted by numerical cosmology @xcite .",
    "the sub - halos are chosen from a halo distribution function which is also flattened to @xmath39 .",
    "figure  5 shows the relation between the integrals of the motion @xmath34 and @xmath36 and the approximate integral @xmath37 .",
    "again , the dispersing effect of the sub - halos is very strong , with the r.m.s .",
    "dispersion in @xmath36 increasing by a factor of 9 with respect to the smooth halo case .      to obtain a statistical understanding of the change in @xmath36",
    ", we undertook a series of simulations of the globular cluster model with initial position and velocity randomly - drawn from the spherical halo distribution function model mentioned above .",
    "ten simulations were undertaken in the galaxy model with the smooth spherical halo .",
    "a further ten simulations probed the same models with the addition of the nfw sub - halos , for a total of 20 simulations with @xmath40 .",
    "to probe the situation with a more flattened halo , we undertook a further 20 simulations with @xmath39 .",
    "the result of these experiments is shown in figure  6 , where we display the r.m.s .",
    "dispersion in @xmath36 for simulations in a smooth halo ( filled circles ) and in in the presence of halo substructures ( star symbols ) .",
    "the top panel shows the case in a spherical halo ( @xmath40 ) , while the bottom panel is for the flattened halo ( @xmath39 ) simulations .",
    "both in a spherical and in a flattened halo , the presence of cdm - like substructures increases substantially , on average , the rms dispersion in @xmath36 of the stream stars . on some orbits ( such as that of our simulation # 9 , the effect can be small , however .",
    "our simulations suggest that globular cluster streams with a very dispersed specific angular momentum , say @xmath41 require that the halo possesses significant substructure .",
    "smaller values , @xmath42 say , would require a smooth halo .",
    "we next consider whether it will be possible to identify a @xmath0 stream orbiting the halo at distances up to @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) with photometry , radial velocity , parallax and proper motion data from the future astrometric mission gaia @xcite .",
    "the great advantage of the gaia dataset is that gives access to the full 6-dimensional phase space information for many stars , and at least 4-dimensional phase - space information ( for those stars that are too far to have measured parallaxes and radial velocities ) .",
    "in addition , the photometric information ( in 15 bands ) can give age and/or metallicity estimates , providing a powerful discriminant between stellar populations .",
    "developing a full model of the galaxy as viewed by gaia is not a trivial task and it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "here we simply make an order of magnitude estimate of the contrast of plausible globular cluster streams over the background by estimating the relative phase space density of stream stars over the large - scale galactic spheroid ( or stellar halo ) component .",
    "we estimate the phase - space size of the stream as follows .",
    "the @xmath45 radial velocity uncertainty of gaia exceeds the intrinsic radial velocity dispersion of the stream , and is about 10% of the halo radial velocity dispersion .",
    "the proper motion dispersion at @xmath43 corresponds to about @xmath46 or 10% of the halo dispersion ( two coordinates ) .",
    "the positional width of the streams are @xmath47 , or about 1% of the width of the halo . with the full 15 photometric bands ,",
    "the distance uncertainty of photometric parallax measurements is likely to be @xmath48% .",
    "thus the phase - space volume occupied by the stream is likely to be about one millionth of that of the halo .",
    "since the stellar halo has a mass of only @xmath49 , the contamination will amount to approximately one star in a thousand . with a limiting magnitude of @xmath50",
    ", the gaia measurements will easily reach down to the horizontal branch at @xmath43 . placing all of the stream at a distance of @xmath51",
    ", we expect @xmath52 stars for @xmath53 per @xmath54 of progenitor mass ( assuming the luminosity function of the draco by odenkirchen et al .",
    "2001 , corrected to a mass to light ratio of @xmath55 ) . for radial velocity measurements",
    "the limiting magnitude is @xmath56 , and the number of available stream stars from the @xmath0 population drops to @xmath57 .",
    "the detection of these streams will be straightforward with gaia , and the increase in the dispersion of @xmath36 due to any halo substructure will be easily resolved .    with results expected towards the end of the second decade of this century ,",
    "the gaia mission is not for the impatient .",
    "so it is worthwhile to investigate whether any presently available datasets already contain sufficient information to uncover the predicted galactic halo dark substructures . to this end",
    "we undertook an analysis of the 2mass dataset , which provides positions and infrared ccd photometry for sources brighter than @xmath58 .",
    "this gives access to a relatively restricted sample of galactic halo m - giants , with no information on their kinematics , and only a very poor constraint on their distances .",
    "the search for the halo streams in the 2mass dataset is presented in paper  2 ; the analysis reveals a single very strong stream , that due to the ongoing disruption of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy .",
    "is it possible to use the sagittarius stream to constrain the lumpiness of the halo ? to investigate this issue we ran two simulations , in the same manner as above , one in a smooth halo , and the other with nfw clumps , using as an initial model for the sagittarius dwarf the model d2 of @xcite .",
    "figure  7 shows the result of this experiment .",
    "this model is much more massive ( @xmath59 ) than the globular cluster model simulated above , and is initially much more extended ( half - mass radius of @xmath60 ) , so it is naturally widely dispersed in @xmath34 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . though the stream particles are heated and dispersed by the sub - halos , the effect is subtle , and will be very difficult to disentangle from the normal dynamical evolution of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "so low mass streams from globular clusters need to be found to act as probes of the dark matter .",
    "we have shown that stellar streams of low mass systems such as disrupted globular clusters can be used to constrain the substructure of the dark halo .",
    "if current cosmological simulations correctly represent reality , ancient stellar streams from globular clusters should be substantially dispersed over the sky , even if on average , the galactic halo potential is close to spherical .",
    "this effect is readily noticeable , as the streams will have a large dispersion in the z - component of specific angular momentum @xmath36 . for the particular halo studied in this contribution",
    "@xmath61 implies the presence of substantial dark matter substructure .",
    "we have simplified the analysis in two major ways .",
    "highly softened point - masses were used to model the halo substructures , which leads to an underestimate of the increased dispersion in @xmath36 in the presence of the nfw clumps .",
    "our other major assumption , that the galactic potential is axisymmetric and does not evolve with time , will likely have the opposite effect , namely to underestimate the dispersion in the absence of the nfw clumps .",
    "our study should be refined once the galactic potential is better constrained ( with data from the gaia and sim missions ) .",
    "this work has shown that an all - sky survey with high precision astrometry , such as will be obtained with the gaia satellite , we will easily be able to detect globular cluster streams , and measure their kinematic properties , especially the dispersion in @xmath36 .",
    "the heating due to the numerous encounters with the dark substructure must also affect the computed destruction rate of globular clusters and low - mass dwarf galaxies alike .",
    "it is possible that the lower limit to the mass of dsph galaxies @xmath62 may be set by these disruptive encounters .",
    "discovering and determining the thickness of ancient stellar streams will allow us to probe the invisible dark halo structures predicted by cold dark matter cosmology .",
    "finding a single narrow stream of width comparable to the tidal radius of a globular cluster would stand in strong contradiction with this theory .",
    "data from the forthcoming gaia mission planned by the european space agency will provide the opportunity to undertake this study .",
