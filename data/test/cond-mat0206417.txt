    "the emergence of slow modes of relaxations is a major signature of the glassy behavior .",
    "@xcite the first consequence of large equilibration time is that the properties of a glass evolve on experimental timescales , the system ages . despite the huge amount of work that has been devoted to glassy systems , a general understanding of slow relaxation processes and of their relation to macroscopic rheology is still lacking .",
    "for example , experimental and numerical data converge to a stretched exponential shape of relaxation phenomena , the so - called kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kww ) relaxation ,  @xcite while mode coupling theory predicts power law behavior .",
    "@xcite when it comes to extend these results to non - linear rheology , the situation is even more difficult from the theoretical point of view , since the system is driven far from equilibrium . at an applied strain rate ,",
    "power law viscosities or the emergence of a yield stress , are common features of complex fluids .",
    "@xcite md simulations of lennard - jones systems  @xcite and recent experiments on colloidal glasses  @xcite are also consistent with such properties .",
    "recent theoretical approaches to non - linear rheology  @xcite have called on ideas originating in mode coupling theory , or trap models of spin glasses .",
    "@xcite these approaches , however , fail to provide a description of non - linear rheology that is consistent with experimental observations ;  @xcite moreover , these models , based only on a phase - space picture of glassiness , do not lead to a clear identification of real - space physical mechanism that are responsible for an observed macroscopic behavior .",
    "some other attempts have been directed towards phenomenological approaches ,  @xcite but those are still unsatisfactory , and do not offer a microscopic picture , even heuristic , of the undergoing physical mechanisms .",
    "the current work lies at the convergence point of several recent theoretical ideas in various fields .",
    "firstly , it is based on the idea by liu , nagel and coworkers , that some unique mechanism lies behind the profound similarities displayed by structural glassy materials , be they colloidal glasses , granular materials , foams , ",
    "@xcite drawing on this idea , the fundemental assumption underlying the current work is that macroscopic properties of dense materials results from major _ dynamical _ properties of structural rearrangement of the contact network .",
    "another important element of the current work comes from the study of density relaxation in granular materials .",
    "@xcite under vertical tapping , granular materials present a time - logarithmic relaxation of the occupied volume ; this is in strong analogy with free - volume relaxation , commonly observed in glasses , and of central importance for aging .",
    "@xcite however , in the case of tapped granular materials , density relaxation can not result from thermal activation since there is no thermal bath : the logarithmic density relaxation has been explained by introducing an equation of motion for free - volume , which characterizes the internal state of the granular material .    finally , this work uses a theory introduced recently by falk and langer to account for elasto - plastic transition in amorphous solids .",
    "@xcite the so - called shear transformation zone ( stz ) theory , originates from ideas by argon , spaepen and others to describe creep in metallic alloys ;  @xcite it has been primarily developed in the framework of fracture mechanics , and provides a general scheme for jamming as resulting from a structuration of the material by creation of arrangements oriented along principal directions of an applied stress .",
    "stz theory calls to free - volume arguments , but in fact , free - volume remains a parameter and enters constants of the theory .",
    "these ideas lead me to propose a general approach to the rheology of dense materials , leading to a simple set of constitutive equations .",
    "@xcite the purpose of the this article is to elaborate the theoretical arguments underlying these equations a to detail some of their consequences .",
    "two types of internal state variables are used : free - volume , which is an isotropic property of a molecular packing , and populations of arrangements , which are related to the distortion of the contact network between molecules ( hence introduce anisotropy ) .",
    "those variables evolves dynamically by free - volume activated processes : two types of rearrangements are associated to compaction and shear motion .",
    "free - volume enters activation factors that control both types of elementary rearrangements , and it is also a dynamical quantity .",
    "kww relaxation has been shown to result from the existence of a distribution of timescales ;  @xcite and it seems that this is often thought to be a necessary requirement . the first contribution of the current work is to show that it is not necessary , and that kww relaxation also result from a more simple mechanism : the interplay between free - volume logarithmic relaxation and free - volume activated shear deformation .",
    "the second contribution of this work is to establish a relation between kww relaxation , time - logarithmic density relaxation , and power law viscosity of a strongly sheared glassy material .",
    "a single parameter of the theory determines these three types of phenomena .",
    "power law viscosity will be shown to result from the existence of shear induced dilatancy .",
    "i propose one of the simplest set of equations that can account for those three properties is a single framework .",
    "the third contribution of this work is to present a theoretical framework which accounts for two coexisting mechanisms for jamming . in mode - coupling theory ,",
    "jamming results from an entropy crisis : at low temperature , the system supports any applied stress because no motion of molecules is allowed .",
    "resistance to shear is therefore an intrinsic property of a material , determined by the thermodynamic parameters of the system , and results from a phase transition . in stz theory ,",
    "jamming results from a structuration of the contact network : jamming requires some amount of plastic deformation to induce the creation of anisotropic structures that can support a static stress .",
    "those two mechanisms are shown here to be incorporated in a unique theory .",
    "the difference between hard and soft glassy materials will be identified with the cases when one or the other process dominates .",
    "the interplay between those two mechanisms lead to a novel interpretation of brittleness and ductility , and provide age - dependent dynamical yield criteria .",
    "the main assumption made in this work is that the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of a glass can be modeled in the framework of a mean - field approximation . by mean - field ,",
    "i mean that spatially averaged quantities account for the local state of the material .",
    "constitutive equations are proposed that relate the average shear stress , to the average shear strain .",
    "the internal state of the material is determined by free - volume and by densities of arrangements ( to be defined further ) .",
    "the forces in the material are supposed to be characterized by a stress tensor , which is written @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the pressure , and @xmath2 the shear stress .",
    "the deformation tensor is defined accordingly , and composed of shear , and of isotropic deformations , directly related to dilatancy .",
    "the average free - volume per molecule is denoted @xmath3 , and is related to the total volume @xmath4 by , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the volume per molecule of the material in random close packing , and @xmath7 is the number of molecules",
    ".    under strong shear , soft glassy materials , like clays , foams , or granular materials , can achieve large deformations ; the evolution of the system is more similar to the flow of a liquid than to the deformation of a solid . in this work",
    "i present a theory of deformation that is expected to hold for large deformations of amorphous solids or soft glassy materials .",
    "since there is a long - standing matter of debate in the mechanical community about linear versus non - linear deformations ,  @xcite it seems necessary to clarify this issue .",
    "i show here that the notion of inherent states  @xcite offers a simple physical interpretation of small and large deformations .    at low temperature , a supercooled liquid or",
    "a glassy material evolves in a complex energy landscape which can be partitioned in domains of influence of local minima . for almost all geometrical configuration of the molecules ,",
    "a unique inherent state is defined as the local minimum to which the systems relaxes if suddenly quenched to zero temperature ,  @xcite and in the absence of forcing . when a material is forced , a constant stress or strain pulls the system through the energy landscape .",
    "each geometrical configuration reached lies in the domain associated with an instantaneous inherent state .",
    "the time series of instantaneous inherent states provides a coarse - grained description of the deformation of the material , and is taken here as the definition of irreversible , plastic , deformation .",
    "the instantaneous inherent state is a natural reference state for a given molecular configuration , and deviation from the instantaneous inherent state defines an _ inherent ( shear ) deformation _",
    "starting from a known initial configuration , the total shear deformation , @xmath9 , results both from inherent deformation , and from the _ flow _ of inherent states in the phase space . by definition",
    ", the deformation @xmath10 is measured between two inherent states : it is not a state variable , since it is defined only from the knowledge of a configuration designed as `` initial '' .",
    "@xmath8 , however , is a state variable , since it is well defined for any instantaneous configuration of the system .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 is expected to be small , since it measures the deformation between two nearby configurations in phase space ; elasticity results from a harmonic approximation for every local minimum : it permits to write the stress as given by a hooke law , @xmath11 . the equation that governs @xmath2",
    "can finally be written : @xmath12 the rate of plastic deformation @xmath13 will come out of a statistical analysis of hopping motion in the phase - space .",
    "it will be written as a function of the state variables of the system , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , an others , to define the constitutive law of the material .",
    "this work relies on the idea that , in dense materials , macroscopic deformation results from free - volume activated rearrangements .",
    "this is expected because temperature is so low that thermal activation becomes irrelevant , and activated processes are controlled by entropic fluctuations of the free - volume .",
    "a rearrangements occurs if sufficient space exists in the neighborhood of a given point ; the transition probabilities are thus determined by the size distribution of voids . in order to work at a mean - field level , the volume distribution is characterized by the single scalar value @xmath3 ; in order to write activation factors , it is necessary to provide an ansatz for the distribution of voids in the material .    in the original works by cohen and turnbull on free - volume theory ,",
    "it was argued that the voids in a material are given by a poisson distribution .",
    "@xcite in their picture , the motion of a molecule in a glassy material is permitted only if it can move into a hole of size , say @xmath14 .",
    "the probability to find a hole larger than @xmath14 , is proportional to @xmath15 : this leads to estimate a diffusion constant @xmath16 , which is a basis of free - volume approaches .",
    "important differences , however , exist between various uses and interpretations of free - volume theory .",
    "falk and langer use free - volume activation factors in the definition of stz theory .",
    "@xcite their argument borrowed from original ideas by edwards and coworkers for granular materials :  @xcite the only extensive variable is supposed to be the volume @xmath4 ; the number of states available to the system is roughly proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is an arbitrary constant with dimension of a volume ; the entropy is defined as , @xmath19 and the intensive quantity , analogous to temperature , is @xmath20 : @xmath21 free - volume thus enters activation factors of the form @xmath15 .    in stz theory ,",
    "this discussion turns out to be somewhat formal since free - volume is taken constant : @xmath3 is absorbed in the phenomenological constants of the resulting equations .",
    "it also leads to complicated expressions for transition rates as functions of the applied stress ( because @xmath14 is supposed to be a function of @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , free - volume should vary when the material dilates or contracts .",
    "this idea has been considered recently by several authors in the analysis of density relaxation of granular materials subjected to vertical tapping .",
    "@xcite in these works , free - volume is understood as a purely dynamical quantity , and relaxes by the motion of single grains in holes created by volume fluctuations .",

    "\\label{eqn : vf:0}\\ ] ] the activation factor @xmath23 $ ] is the probability that a hole of size larger than @xmath14 is present at a given point in the material ; @xmath24 is determined by the tapping frequency .",
    "the current work borrows from those different lines of thought .",
    "drawing on the works initiated on granular compaction , free - volume is a dynamical quantity ; voids are expected to redistribute fast enough in the material ; fast means , faster than free - volume activated collective rearrangements themselves .",
    "this is justified because redistribution of free - volume requires very tiny displacements of the molecules , and voids , considered as particles , are expected to diffuse faster than molecules themselves : around a void , there is by definition an excess of free - volume .",
    "there is an important difference , however , from the picture used in  @xcite where compaction results from the motion of a single grain in a hole . here ,",
    "borrowing on the argument of stz theory , compaction results from elementary rearrangements , involving several molecules at a mesoscopic scale .",
    "probabilities of transitions are estimated by entropic arguments . due to the redistribution of voids",
    ", the number of states available to the system is supposed to be proportional to @xmath17 at all times : the fast redistribution of voids allows the system to realize a quasi - equilibrium thermodynamic ensemble , determined by an intensive variable , @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of an intensive variable , associated to the fluctuations of molecular configurations , is supported by the observation of an effective fluctuation - dissipation theorem in sheared fluids .",
    "@xcite for reasons of clarity , and to be specific , i reserve the word temperature for the intensive quantity associated with the fluctuations of energy , or for the specific kinetic energy;therefore , i will not comply with to the recent use of `` effective temperature '' for something that is neither thermodynamic nor granular temperature .",
    "nevertheless , the observation of an effective fluctuation - dissipation theorem indicates that such an intensive quantity exists , without identifying what this quantity actually is . here , it is identified to @xmath3 and is associated with entropic fluctuations of molecular configurations at a mesoscopic scale .",
    "the important novelty introduced in the current work it that @xmath3 enters activation factors and is also a dynamical quantity .",
    "this is in weak analogy with granular temperature , which is a temperature , and evolves dynamically .",
    "but granular temperature couples with properties of the material only as far as it determines a collision frequency ,  @xcite while free - volume enters exponential prefactors in transformation rates",
    ". another important element of the current theory is that the dynamics of free - volume results both from density relaxation by activated rearrangements  which exists in the absence of forcing  and from dilatancy induced by the macroscopic shear flow  which occurs when the system is driven out - of - equilibrium . the non - linear coupling with the mean - flow will be addressed later",
    "; i will first continue the description of rearrangement processes .",
    "the typical elementary compaction process , corresponds to the system going through a saddle point in phase space .",
    "the rate of such transformations is controlled by free - volume fluctuations and this saddle is characterized by a typical activation volume @xmath14 , which depends on the shape of the molecules , and on the details of microscopic interactions .",
    "the activated hopping of the system through this type of saddle permits density relaxation , and leads to an equation of motion for @xmath3 of the form  ( [ eqn : vf:0 ] ) .",

    "let me use a very minimal argument : shear strain is supposed to be proportional to shear stress : @xmath25 ; where @xmath26 is proportional to a free - volume activation factor .",
    "the current approach relies on the remark that the relative motion of molecules that permit compaction and shear are different ; different types of collective rearrangements , should require different activation volumes . in phase space , shear and compaction correspond to two types of saddle points , and those saddle points are entropic barriers of different heights . the activation volume for an elementary shear",

    "@xcite the first assumption on which stz theory is based is that elementary shear deformation does not occur just anywhere in the material , but in zones , where a rearrangement is permitted by the local configuration of molecules . a shear transformation zone ( stz ) is thus defined as a locus within a material , where an elementary shear is possible .",
    "another essential assumption is that stz s are two - state systems .",
    "this can be understood as follows : an elementary arrangement corresponds to the opening and closing of some contacts between molecules ; once such a rearrangement has occurred somewhere in the material , these molecules can not shear further in the same direction , but they can shear backwards .",

    "this is apparently related to a theoretical approach of fracture mechanics , recently introduced by brener and spatschek ,  @xcite where the dynamics of the fracture is controlled by diffusion of molecules along the surface . for soft glassy materials , on the contrary , the propagation of a fracture is expected to induce more easily observable plastic deformation in the bulk of the material .",

    "for example , free - volume is related to the average number of contacts per molecule ; in a foam , the deformation of the bubbles can be accounted for a effective free - volume that is determined by the packing of effective overlapping particles as those used in the simulations by durian ,  @xcite even though the relative proportions of a fluid mixture is kept constant ; in a colloidal suspension , the existence of electrostatic screening contributes to an effective size of the particle that depends on the packing structure .",
    "in fact , the assumption made in this work is rather general , and many situation can be expected to lead to a dynamically driven effective free - volume ; this may explain the ubiquity of glassy behavior .",

    "the introduction of a whole distribution of timescales is a very general way to account for non - ergodicity . here",
    "i assume that a much weaker ergodicity breaking is sufficient , and this is directly supported by the observation that fluctuation - dissipation theorem holds in a weak ( but , not so weak ) form .",
    "this indicates that the underlying distributions of state variables should not ( in fact ) be too weird , and that an effective width accounts for its essential features .",

    "the set of curves displayed in figure  [ fig : relax3 ] is very reminiscent of the temperature dependency of relaxation spectra .",
    "@xcite obviously , the parameters of the theory should depend on temperature and other thermodynamical parameters , but here i purposely do not intend to address this question",
    ". there are ( at least ) two reasons for that : firstly , because glassy behavior is observed in many systems , in particular in suspensions or in granular materials , where thermodynamical temperature is not a relevant parameter . secondly , because it seems to me more interesting to extract all possible conclusions from the simple equations proposed without trying to incorporate them into a more specific setup .",
    "i do think that an effective dynamically driven free - volume should emerge from microscopic dynamics under minimal assumptions .",
    "therefore , it seems to me important to try to get some fundamental understanding of the consequences of such assumptions for a fixed set of parameters , without complicating the discussion .",
    "the dependency of the parameters of this theory on thermodynamic quantities is definitely an important issue to address in the future , but it first requires to have some intuition about the outcome of those equations .",
    "this work is intended to provide a grid of possible behavior displayed by simple equations , and i hope it can be helpful for further developments .    finally , one major interest of the current work is , in my opinion , that is gives a unified picture where different mechanisms for jamming coexist .",
    "this coexistence of jamming with non - linear rheology has been observed experimentally , but could not be captured by earlier model of glassy rheology .",
