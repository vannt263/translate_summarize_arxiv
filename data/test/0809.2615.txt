    "sandpile models with stochastic toppling rules are important subclass of sandpile models @xcite .",
    "the first such model was studied by manna @xcite , and these are usually known as manna models in the literature .",
    "they are able to describe the avalanche behavior seen experimentally in the piles of granular media much better than the deterministic models @xcite . also , in numerical studies , one gets better scaling collapse , and consequently , more reliable estimates for the values of the critical exponents , than for models with deterministic toppling rules @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , at present , the theoretical understanding of models with stochastic toppling rules is much less than that of their deterministic counterparts , e.g. the bak - tang -wiesenfeld ( btw ) model @xcite .",
    "for example , there is no analogue of the burning test to distinguish the transient and the recurrent states of a general manna model . for the deterministic case",
    ", it is known that all the recurrent configurations occur with equal probability in the steady state .",
    "a similar characterization of the steady state is not known in the manna case .",
    "the steady state has been explicitly determined only for the fully directed stochastic models @xcite . in some cases",
    ", one can formally characterize the recurrent states of the model , e.g. the @xmath1-dimensional oslo rice pile model , but a straightforward direct depth - first calculation of the exact probabilities of different configurations in the steady state takes @xmath2 steps where @xmath3 is the system length @xcite . while the exact values of the critical exponents have been conjectured for @xmath4 dimensional directed manna model @xcite , the prototypical undirected manna model in one dimension has resisted an exact solution so far @xcite . in higher dimensions ,",
    "most of the studies are only numerical , and deal with the estimation of the critical exponents of avalanche distribution , and the universality class of the model @xcite .    while the original manna model did not have the abelian property of the btw model",
    ", one can construct stochastic toppling rules with abelian property @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we discuss this abelian version of the stochastic manna model .",
    "it is a special case of the more general abelian distributed processors model ( adp ) @xcite .",
    "we shall use the terms deterministic abelian sandpile models ( dasm ) and stochastic abelian sandpile models ( sasm ) , if we need to distinguish between these two classes of models .",
    "we use the algebra of the addition operators to determine the steady state of the model .",
    "this algebraic approach provides a computationally efficient method to determine the markov evolution matrix of the model .",
    "the addition operators of sasm are not necessarily diagonalizable even if we restrict ourselves to the space of recurrent configurations . using the abelian algebra",
    "we determine a generalized eigenvector basis in which the operators reduce to jordan block form .",
    "we also define a transformation matrix between this basis and the configuration basis , and express the steady state in the latter basis .",
    "this procedure is illustrated by explicitly writing out the case of a one dimensional manna model . in this special case",
    ", we can show that each jordan block is at most of dimension @xmath5 .",
    "we determine the numerically exact steady state of the model for systems of size up to @xmath6 and determine the asymptotic density profile by extrapolating the results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section @xmath5 , we define the model precisely . in section @xmath7",
    ", we define the addition operators for the model , and discuss their algebra .",
    "calculation of the eigenvalues and the jordan block structure of the addition operators are given in section @xmath8 .",
    "the transformation matrix between the generalized eigenvector basis and the configuration basis is determined in section @xmath9 and is used to determine the steady state vector in the configuration basis in section @xmath10 .",
    "the exact numerical determination of the steady state is discussed in section @xmath11 with some concluding remarks in section @xmath12 .",
    "we define a generalized manna model on a graph of @xmath13 sites with a non - negative integer height variable @xmath14 defined at each site @xmath15 .",
    "let the threshold height at @xmath15 be @xmath16 , and the site is unstable if @xmath17 .",
    "if the system is stable , a sand grain is added at a randomly chosen site which increases the height by @xmath1 .",
    "for each site @xmath15 , there is a set of @xmath18 lists @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "if a site is unstable , it relaxes by the following toppling rule : we decrease its height by @xmath21 .",
    "then , with probability @xmath22 , we select the list @xmath19 , independent of any previous selections , and then add one grain to each site in that list .",
    "if a site occurs more than once in the list , we add that many grains to that site .",
    "toppling at a site can make other sites unstable and they topple in their turn , until all the lattice sites are stable .",
    "it follows from the abelian property of the model that the probabilities of different final stable configurations are independent of the order in which different unstable sites are toppled .",
    "we illustrate these rules with some examples below .    *",
    "* model a * ( the one dimensional manna model ) : the graph is @xmath3 sites on a line and @xmath23 , for all sites . on toppling each grain",
    "is transfered to its neighbors with equal probability .",
    "hence we have @xmath24 , for all @xmath15 , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "also grains can move out of the system if toppling occurs at a boundary site .",
    "* * model b * ( the one dimensional dissipative manna model ) : same as model a except that on toppling a grain can move out of the system with probability @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath31 and the lists of neighbors @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an empty set .",
    "the corresponding probabilities are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "+ in this case , one can use periodic boundary conditions , as there is dissipation at all sites .",
    "the steady state is critical only in the limit @xmath43 . for the models a and b , it is easy to see that all stable configurations occur in the steady state with non - zero probability .",
    "we can also define stochastic models where the recurrent configurations form only an exponentially small fraction of all stable configurations .",
    "an example of this type is * * model c * : the graph is a square lattice with @xmath13 sites and @xmath44 . under toppling , with equal probability two particles",
    "are transfered to either horizontal or vertical neighbors .",
    "hence @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 with @xmath48 .    in the following",
    "we will mostly confine ourselves to model a. the treatment of other cases presents no special difficulties .",
    "let us denote the space of stable states as @xmath49 spanned by @xmath50 basis vectors labeled by @xmath51 .",
    "we define @xmath52 as the probability of finding the system in the basis @xmath51 at time @xmath53 . to each set @xmath54 , we associate a vector @xmath55 belonging to the vector space @xmath49 , and write @xmath56 we define the particle addition operators @xmath57 for all @xmath15 as linear operators acting on @xmath49 as follows : consider adding a sand grain at site @xmath15 in a configuration @xmath51 , and relaxing the system until a stable configuration is reached . for stochastic toppling rules , the resulting state is not necessarily a basis vector corresponding to a unique stable configuration , but a linear combination of them .",
    "if the resulting configuration is @xmath58 with probability @xmath59 , we define @xmath60 for all @xmath51 .",
    "note that the action of any of these operators on a given configuration gives a unique probability state vector .",
    "( [ a_i ] ) is a formal definition of the operators @xmath61 .",
    "one can think of these as @xmath62 matrices , but it is quite non - trivial to actually determine the matrix elements @xmath59 explicitly from the toppling rules .",
    "this is because of the non - zero probability of an arbitrary large number of toppling before a steady state is reached .",
    "for an example , consider the avalanches in model a for system of size @xmath63 . consider the @xmath64 stable configurations as the basis vectors and denote them by their height values @xmath65 .",
    "the action of @xmath66 on @xmath67 will generate a unstable state @xmath68 . using the toppling rules we can write the following set of equations for three unstable states @xmath69",
    "we see that there is a nonzero probability that the avalanche can continue for more than @xmath70 toppling , for any finite @xmath70 .",
    "e.g. in the sequence @xmath71 .",
    "thus straight forward application of the relaxation rules do not result in a finite procedure to determine the unstable vector @xmath68 in terms of the stable configurations .",
    "instead , we have to write eq .",
    "( [ |0,2,0 ] ) as a matrix equation @xmath72 and then invert it . more generally , the determination of @xmath73 involves working in a large space of unstable configurations .",
    "for example in model a , there are @xmath74 stable configurations , where each site has @xmath75 or @xmath1 particle",
    ". total number of particles is at most @xmath3 . on adding one particle ,",
    "the number of particles can become @xmath76 , where initially , only one site will have height @xmath5 . however , it is easy to verify that by toppling one can generate configurations where the number of particles at a site is much greater than @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , all the @xmath76 particles could be at the same site",
    ". then the total number of stable and unstable configurations @xmath77 is the number of ways one can distribute @xmath76 particles on @xmath3 sites .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath77 varies as @xmath78 , and one needs to invert a matrix of size @xmath79 .    in this paper",
    "we will use the operator algebra to obtain an efficient method to determine the probabilities @xmath73 explicitly which requires inverting a matrix only of size @xmath80 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the addition operators for different sites commute i.e. @xmath81 = 0 \\rm{,~ ~ ~ for ~ all ~ } i , j.\\ ] ] unlike the dasm , the inverse operators @xmath82 for sasm need not exist , even if we restrict ourselves to the set of recurrent configurations .",
    "this is because among the recurrent states , one can have two different initial probability vectors that yield the same resultant vector .",
    "this makes the determination of the matrix form of the operators difficult for this model .",
    "in general the matrices @xmath61 need not be diagonalizable . however ,",
    "using the abelian property , we can construct a common set of generalized eigenvectors for all the operators @xmath91 such that in this basis the matrices simultaneously reduce to jordan block form .",
    "these generalized eigenvectors split the vector space @xmath49 into disjoint subspaces , each corresponding to distinct set of eigenvalues .",
    "there will be at least one common eigenvector in each subspace , for all the addition operators .",
    "proof : consider one of the operators , say @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath93 be the subspace of @xmath49 spanned by the ( right ) generalized eigen vectors of @xmath92 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath94 .",
    "there is at least one such generalized eigenvector , so @xmath93 is non - null .",
    "we pick one of the other addition operators , say @xmath95 . from the fact that @xmath95 commutes with @xmath92",
    ", it immediately follows that @xmath95 acting on any vector in the subspace @xmath93 leaves it within the same subspace .",
    "diagonalizing @xmath95 within this subspace , we construct a possibly smaller but still non - null subspace @xmath96 which is spanned by simultaneous eigenvectors of @xmath92 and @xmath95 with eigenvalues @xmath94 and @xmath97 . repeating this argument with the other operators",
    ", one can construct vectors which are simultaneous eigenvectors of all the @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath98 be such an eigenvector , with @xmath99 then from eq.(@xmath10)the eigenvalues satisfy the following set of equations @xmath100 where we have used the notation @xmath101 , for any list @xmath88 .    rather than work with this general case , we will consider the special case in model a for simplicity .",
    "no extra complications occur in the more general case .",
    "then , from eq.([moda ] ) , the corresponding eigenvalue equation is @xmath102 these are l coupled quadratic equations in @xmath3 complex variables @xmath91 .",
    "we can reduce them to @xmath3 linear equations by taking square root @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "( [ a_0 ] ) sets the values for the eigenvalues of @xmath105 and @xmath106 which are @xmath107 there are @xmath74 different choices for the set of @xmath3 different @xmath108 s and for each such choice , we get a set of eigenvalues @xmath91 .",
    "in general , there will be degenerate sets of eigenvalues and the degeneracy arises if one of the @xmath109 is zero . using the triangular inequality it is easy to show that @xmath110 i.e. @xmath111 are convex functions of discrete variables @xmath15 .",
    "then , given the boundary condition in eq .",
    "( [ a_1 ] ) , there could at most be one @xmath112 in the solution for a given @xmath113 , which means that each eigenvalue set can be at most doubly degenerate .",
    "finding the number of degeneracies of solutions is interesting but difficult in general .",
    "we show that for @xmath63 ( mod @xmath8 ) the number of such degenerate sets of eigenvalues @xmath114 .",

    "calculation for simple choices of @xmath108 shows that the degeneracies are possible only if @xmath63 ( mod @xmath8 ) .",
