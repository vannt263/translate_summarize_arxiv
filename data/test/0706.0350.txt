    "there has been important progress in the question of local energy decay for the solution of the wave equation in black hole type space - times other the last years .",

    "results on the decay of local energy are believed to be a prerequisite for a possible proof of the global nonlinear stability of these space - times .",
    "today global nonlinear stability is only known for the minkowski space - time ( see @xcite ) .    from our point of view one of the most efficient approaches to the question of local energy decay",
    "is the theory of resonances .",
    "resonances correspond to the frequencies and rates of dumping of signals emitted by the black hole in the presence of perturbations ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4.35 ) ) . on the one hand",
    "these resonances are today an important hope of effectively detecting the presence of a black hole as we are theoretically able to measure the corresponding gravitational waves . on the other hand ,",
    "the distance of the resonances to the real axis reflects the stability of the system under the perturbation : larger distances correspond to more stability . in particular the knowledge of the localization of resonances",
    "permits to answer the question if there is decay of local energy and at which rate .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show how this method applies to the simplest model of a black hole : the de sitter  schwarzschild black hole .    in the euclidean space , such results",
    "are already known , especially in the non trapping geometry .",
    "the first result is due to lax and phillips ( see their book ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem iii.5.4 ) ) . they have proved that the cut - off propagator associated to the wave equation outside an obstacle in odd dimension @xmath1 ( more precisely the lax ",
    "phillips semi - group @xmath2 ) has an expansion in terms of resonances if @xmath3 is compact for one @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , the local energy decays exponentially uniformly . from melrose ",
    "sjstrand @xcite , this assumption is true for non trapping obstacles .",
    "vanberg @xcite has obtained such results for general , non trapping , differential operators using different techniques . in the trapping case , we know , by the work of ralston @xcite , that it is not possible to obtain uniform decay estimates without loss of derivatives . in the exterior domain of two strictly convex obstacles",
    ", the local energy decays exponentially with a loss of derivatives , by the work of ikawa @xcite .",
    "this situation is close to the one treated in this paper .",
    "we also mention the works tang ",
    "zworski @xcite and burq ",
    "zworski @xcite concerning the resonances close to the real line .",
    "thanks to the work of s barreto and zworski ( @xcite ) we have a very good knowledge of the localization of resonances for the wave equation in the de sitter  schwarzschild metric . using their results we can describe an expansion of the solution of the wave equation in the de sitter  schwarzschild metric in terms of resonances . the main term in the expansion is due to a zero resonance .",
    "the error term decays polynomially if we permit a logarithmic derivative loss in the angular directions and exponentially if we permit an @xmath0 derivative loss in the angular directions . for initial data in the complement of a one - dimensional space",
    "the local energy is integrable if we permit a @xmath5 derivative loss with @xmath6 .",
    "this estimate is almost optimal in the sense that it becomes false for @xmath7 .",
    "the method presented in this paper does not directly apply to the schwarzschild case .",
    "this is not linked to the difficulty of the photon sphere which we treat in this paper , but to the possible accumulation of resonances at the origin in the schwarzschild case .",
