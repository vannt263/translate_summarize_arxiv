    "the physics of normal - metal  superconducting ( ns ) hybrid structures has been of interest for several decades . in the sixties ,",
    "the scattering of a quasi - particle at a ns interface was first described by andreev .",
    "@xcite thus , it is now widely known that an electron approaching to a superconductor from the normal - metal side , with an energy above the fermi level , can be reflected at the interface as a hole with an energy below the fermi level and same momentum , but in opposite direction .",
    "a cooper pair is thus formed in the superconductor .",
    "this scattering process is known as andreev reflection .",
    "more recently , the interest in this subject was renewed in the field of mesoscopic physics , where the electron wave function remains coherent and therefore quantum interference effects play an important role .",
    "several effects of phase - coherence andreev scattering are under current investigation . in addition , the effects of disorder and ballistic - chaotic scattering in hybrid structures have been widely studied . for example",
    "quantities such as the density of states and the ehrenfest time as well as phenomena such as coherent backscattering , excitation and gap fluctuations , superconducting proximity effect , and resonant tunneling have been investigated in mesoscopic hybrid structures.@xcite also , the effects of andreev scattering on the conductance through quantum dots whose classical dynamics is integrable or mixed ( regular and chaotic ) have been investigated.@xcite    on the other hand , random matrix theory ( rmt ) has been useful to study the statistical properties of many different phenomena in normal metals @xcite as well as in superconductors . in particular , the effects of ns interfaces on the conductance of disordered and chaotic billiards  quantum dots  have received considerable attention.@xcite recently , some statistical properties of the conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic ns heterostructures have been experimentally studied in ref .  [ ] where the explanation of the experimental results was based on rmt of quantum transport through chaotic quantum dots ; it was also pointed out the importance of considering the potential barriers formed at the ns interface .    using a scattering approach to the problem of quantum transport and rmt , here we study the statistical properties of the conductance through a quantum - chaotic dot with a superconducting lead attached to it . in particular , we are interested in the distribution of the conductance . the configurations of one and two normal leads additionally attached to the dot are considered .",
    "we take into account the presence of a schottky barrier  which is formed in real ns junctions of transparency @xmath0 in the superconducting lead .",
    "thus , for these two setups we calculate the complete distribution of conductances for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "as we will see , the conductance distribution is affected by the presence of the superconducting region as well as the scattering at the schottky barrier .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we briefly review general ideas about electron - hole scattering at ns junctions .",
    "we also introduce the scattering matrices associated to the different elements of our experimental setup . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the two - terminal configuration .",
    "firstly , we calculate the total scattering matrix and the conductance . secondly , we present our results for the distribution of the conductance for the cases of time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath1 ) and broken time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "simple analytical expressions are provided for the conductance distribution .",
    "iv is devoted to the three - terminal configuration .",
    "we calculate the necessary scattering - matrix elements in order to calculate the conductance and present the results for its distribution for both symmetries ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , at different values of the transparency of the schottky barrier .",
    "a summary and conclusions of our work are presented in sec . v.",
    "we start our study with some general ideas on the scattering mechanism of electrons in a ns junction , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] . as we mentioned above , in a ns junction an incident electron from the normal side",
    "can be reflected by the superconductor as an electron or as a hole . the electron and hole wave functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , satisfy the bogoliubov - de gennes equation@xcite given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the single electron hamiltonian and @xmath7 is the potential which couples the electron and hole wave functions .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 is independent of spin - orbit interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "far from the ns boundary the superconducting gap @xmath7 goes to zero in the normal - metal region , whereas in the superconducting region the pair potential has an amplitude @xmath8 and phase @xmath9 . near the ns interface , however , @xmath7 depends on the details of the ns junction ; assuming that the width of the ns interface is small compared to the superconducting coherence length and neglecting any pairing interaction in the normal region , the pair potential is usually modeled as a step potential : @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the step function .",
    "now we consider that the energy of an incident electron is in the energy gap ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the fermi energy ) where there are no propagating wave solutions in the superconducting region , i.e. , the electron is reflected as a hole or electron .",
    "let us denote by @xmath14 the reflection matrix describing the andreev reflection .",
    "within the andreev approximation , where only andreev scattering processes are taking into account and with the above assumptions for @xmath7 , a solution of eq .",

    "we model this schottky barrier as a planar barrier characterized by its transparency @xmath0 .",
    "it is of relevance to consider the effect of this potential on the transport since , as we will see later , the conductance and therefore its statistical properties are affected depending on the strength of @xmath0 .    on the other hand , since in the normal region electrons and holes",
