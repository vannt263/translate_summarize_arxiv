    "dynamics of self - gravitating stellar systems and plasma fluids are governed by the collisionless boltzmann equation ( cbe ) @xcite .",
    "finding a general solution of the cbe has been a challenging problem in various disciplines of physical sciences . due to existing difficulties of the general problem , finding a solution to",
    "the linearized cbe became the center of attraction in the twentieth century when @xcite and van kampen ( 1955 ) discovered the normal modes of collisionless ensembles . later in 1970",
    "s , @xcite developed a matrix theory that was capable of computing normal modes of stellar systems through solving a nonlinear eigenvalue problem .",
    "his theory remained as the only analytical perturbation theory used by the community of galactic dynamicists over the past three decades .",
    "@xcite assumed an exponential form @xmath0 for the time - dependent part of physical quantities where @xmath1 , and solved the linearized cbe for the perturbed distribution function ( df ) @xmath2 in terms of the perturbed potential @xmath3 . after expanding the potential and density functions in terms of bi - orthogonal basis sets in the configuration space , he used the weighted residual form of the fundamental equation @xmath4 to obtain a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for the complex eigenfrequency @xmath5 .",
    "for self - consistent perturbations the surface density @xmath6 is related to @xmath3 through poisson s integral , and the symbols @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the elements of velocity and position vectors .",
    "@xcite used kalnajs s theory to compute the modes of the isothermal disk @xcite , which has the astrophysically important property of a flat rotation curve .",
    "his analysis was then extended by @xcite to general scale - free disks with arbitrary cusp slopes .",
    "application of kalnajs s theory to soft - centered models of stellar disks has been mainly focused on the isochrone and kuzmin - toomre disks @xcite . a disk with exponential light profile and an approximately flat rotation curve was also investigated by @xcite .",
    "more recently jalali & hunter ( 2005a , hereafter jh ) gave new results for soft - centered models of stellar disks .",
    "they showed the importance of a boundary integral in the modal properties of unidirectional disks and computed a fundamental bar mode and a secondary spiral mode for the isochrone , kuzmin - toomre and a newly introduced family of cored exponential disks .",
    "jh also extended kalnajs s first order perturbation theory to the second order , and illustrated energy and angular momentum content of different fourier components .",
    "their bar charts showed that only a few number of expansion terms in the radial angle govern the perturbed dynamics .",
    "implementation of kalnajs s ( 1977 ) theory , however , has some technical problems due to the nonlinear dependency of his matrix equations on @xmath5 .",
    "most computational methods that deal with nonlinear eigenvalue problems are iterative .",
    "they start with an initial guess of the solution and continue with a search scheme in the frequency space .",
    "newton s method is perhaps the most efficient technique that guarantees a quadratic convergence should the initial guess be close enough to the solution .",
    "the key issue in success of any iterative scheme is the attracting or repelling nature of an eigenvalue .",
    "it is obvious that only attracting eigenvalues can be captured by iterative methods while we have no priori knowledge of their basins of attraction in order to make our initial guess .",
    "the mentioned computational difficulties make it a formidable task to explore all normal modes of a stellar system , which include growing modes as well as stationary van kampen modes .",
    "moreover , it is not easy to develop a general nonlinear theory based on kalnajs s method for studying the interaction of modes .",
    "@xcite introduced an alternative method for the normal mode calculation of stellar disks whose outcome was a linear eigenvalue problem for @xmath5 .",
    "his method is capable of finding all eigenmodes of a stellar disk should one use fine grids in the action space .",
    "polyachenko s method is somehow costly because it results in a large linear system of equations to assure point - wise convergence in the action space and mean convergence of fourier expansions in the space of the radial angle .",
    "extension of his method to nonlinear regime is another challenging problem yet to be investigated .",
    "@xcite has also followed an approach similar to @xcite and studied the instability of stellar disks surrounding massive objects .",
    "his eigenvalue equations involve action variables , and practically , need to be solved over a discretized grid in the space of actions .",
    "recent developments in fluid mechanics @xcite inspired me to formulate the dynamics of stellar systems in a new framework , which is capable of solving the cbe not only in the linear regime , but also in its full nonlinear form .",
    "the method systematically searches for smooth solutions of the cbe by expanding the perturbed df using fourier series of angle variables and an appropriate set of trial functions in the space of actions .",
    "coefficients of expansion are unknown time - dependent amplitude functions whose evolution equations are obtained by the petrov - galerkin projection @xcite of the cbe .",
    "that is indeed taking the weighted residual form of the cbe by integration over the action - angle space and deriving a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the amplitude functions .",
    "the associated first order system of odes leads to a linear eigenvalue problem , which is solved using standard numerical methods .    in this paper",
    "i present my new method and apply it to explore the modal properties of a model galaxy . in a second paper , i will address the nonlinear evolution of modes and wave interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections [ sec::dynamical - theory ] and [ sec::linear - theory ] ,",
    "i use the petrov - galerkin method to project the cbe to a system of odes in the time domain and derive a system of linear eigenvalue equations .",
    "section [ sec : modes - exp - disk ] presents the eigenfrequency spectra and their corresponding mode shapes of the cored exponential disk of jh .",
    "the stars of this model move in the field of a soft - centered logarithmic potential .",
    "i also investigate the effect of physical parameters of the equilibrium model on the modal content . in section [ sec : final - discussions ] , i discuss on the nature of a self - gravitating mode and compare the performance of my method with other theories . some fundamental achievements of this work are summarized in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "i use the usual polar coordinates @xmath9 and assume that the temporal evolution of the df and gravitational potential starts from an axisymmetric equilibrium state described by @xmath10 and @xmath11 so that @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the momentum vector conjugate to @xmath14 .",
    "motion of stars in the equilibrium state is governed by the zeroth order hamiltonian @xmath15 for bounded orbits , @xmath16 and @xmath17 become librating and rotating , respectively .",
    "one can therefore describe the dynamics using the action variables @xmath18 , @xmath19 and their conjugate angles @xmath20 .",

    "figure [ pic : mode - shape - m2 ] displays the wave patterns and amplitude functions of modes b1 , b2 , g , s1 , s2 and s3 .",
    "it is seen that the patterns of s - modes rotate slower and become more extensive as the mode number increases .",
    "mode s6 , which is at the bifurcation point of the spiral family , has the largest extent .",
    "eight wave packets of this mode are distributed by a phase shift of 90 degrees along major spiral arms .",
    "mode g has at most two density peaks on its major spiral arms but the magnitude of its second peak increases as the disk is cooled .",
    "modes b1 , b2 , s1 , s2 and s3 are , respectively , analogous to modes a , b , c , e and f of a gaussian disk explored in @xcite .",
    "there are three low - speed modes in figure 11 of @xcite that have not been labeled , but they are analogs of modes s4 , s5 and s6 .",
    "mode g and toomre s mode d also have some similarities but are of different origins ( see  [ sec : final - discussions ] ) .",
    "none of them can be stabilized only by increasing the fraction of dark matter .",
    "figure [ pic : spectrum - m2-unstable]_a _ shows that the fundamental mode obtained by jh coincides with mode b1 .",
    "the wave pattern of mode b1 ( displayed in figure [ pic : mode - shape - m2 ] ) is identical to the mode shape computed using kalnajs s theory and demonstrated in figure 8 of jh .",
    "jh found a secondary mode which lies between modes b2 and g. that mode is also a double - peaked spiral and it is not easy to identify its true nature unless we investigate its evolution as the model parameters vary . by comparing figure 10_a _ of jh with figure [ pic : spectrum - m2-unstable]_b _",
    ", one can see that both mode b2 and the secondary mode of jh are destabilized through a tangent bifurcation while mode g has a different nature . the bifurcation frequency of mode b2 that i find ( @xmath200 ) matches very well with the frequency of the stabilized secondary mode of jh ( see figure 10_a _ in jh but note that their vertical axis indicates @xmath201 ) .",
    "i conclude that the secondary mode of jh is indeed mode b2 although it seems to be closer to mode g. the existing discrepancy is due to different length scale of clutton - brock functions that jh have used for finding the secondary mode . by adjusting",
    "@xmath53 one can improve the location of b2 .",
    "however , this is an unnecessary attempt given the fact that mode b2 has already been identified , and the computation accuracy of other eigenfrequencies has an impressive level .",
    "the parameter @xmath149 controls the density profile of the dark matter component , specifically near the galactic center .",
    "the fraction of dark to luminous matter has its minimum value in marginal models with @xmath202 .",
    "i choose a marginal @xmath203 model with @xmath204 , which has also been investigated by jh .",

    "the spectrum has been computed for @xmath188 .",
    "although @xmath137 bar and spiral modes survive in this model , their pattern speeds and growth rates drop considerably .",
    "mode g has been wiped out of existence by dark matter penetration into the center , and four unstable modes ( c1 , c2 , c3 and c4 ) have emerged that constitute a new family of spiral modes . they populate the central regions of the disk in most of @xmath203 models .",
    "again , the location of eigenfrequencies obtained by jh have been marked by circles .",
    "the agreement between the results of jh and the present study is very good and the variance is less than @xmath205 .",

    "similar to the previous @xmath153 model , s - modes and mode b1 are destabilized through tangent and pitchfork bifurcations , respectively .",
    "all c - modes are born by a pitchfork bifurcation although some minor modes of the same nature come and go as @xmath151 varies .",
    "the loci of modes b1 and s1 ( in figure [ pic : spectrum - m2-vary - lambda]_a _ ) are in harmony with the results of kalnajs s method plotted in figure 10_b _ of jh .",
    "it is noted that the locus of mode b1 steeply joins the real axis , well before stabilizing the s - modes .",
    "this is how slowly growing spirals may dominate a stellar disk .",
    "there are no new families of growing modes in @xmath207 models .",
    "dark matter in these models induces a rising rotation curve on the disk stars ( see figure 6 in jh ) and the population of s - modes declines .",
    "the growth rate of mode b2 increases proportional to @xmath149 , but that of mode g falls off although mode g is still robust against the variations of @xmath151 .",
    "mode g has its maximum growth rate in @xmath153 models , which suggests that it must be a self - gravitating response of the luminous matter that involves only the potential of the disk , @xmath208 .",

    "the eigenfrequency loci of modes c1 and b2 , and s - modes ( as @xmath151 varies ) are similar to @xmath153 models , but the locus of mode b1 loses its steepness and stretches towards small pattern speeds in an approximately linear form until it joins the real @xmath213-axis .",
    "the bifurcation frequency of mode b2 differs from s - modes and it is larger .    figure [ pic : mode - shape - m2-sr34 ] shows the wave patterns of modes b1 , b2 , s1 , c1 , c2 and c3 for the model with @xmath204 . the ( isolated ) mode b1 is still a single - peaked bar although its edge is more extensive as the flat part of its @xmath209 plot indicates",
    ". mode s1 is a triple - peaked spiral ( as before ) and mode b2 is being stabilized ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "it is seen that mode b2 has a bar - like structure , which justifies its classification as the secondary bar mode .",
    "the pattern of s1 and its @xmath209 plot can be compared with figure 9 in jh .",
    "the agreement is quite satisfactory .",
    "there is a remarkable difference between the patterns of c- and s - modes although both families have spiral structures .",
    "in contrast to s - modes that become more extensive as their growth rate decays , c - modes are shrunk to central regions because their pattern speed increases .",
    "c - modes are also a bifurcating family , but their bifurcation point lies on large pattern speeds associated with the azimuthal frequency ( @xmath215 ) of central stars .    the parameters @xmath151 and @xmath149 are essentially controlling the fraction and density profile of dark matter component , respectively . however , the radial velocity dispersion @xmath216 of the equilibrium state is also playing an important role in the perturbed dynamics .",
    "@xmath216 is an indicator of the initial temperature of the disk .",
    "@xcite had already pointed out that the pitch angle of spiral patterns decreases when @xmath217 ( see their figure 7 ) . apart from this morphological implication , can the variation in the disk temperature affect the modal content ? in the following subsection ,",
    "i trace the evolution of growing waves by changing the disk temperature and show that the population of s - modes is larger in rotationally supported , cold disks .",
    "the parameter @xmath161 of the dfs of jh controls the disk temperature by adjusting the size of the isotropic core and the population of near circular orbits . as @xmath161 increases",
    ", the streaming velocity @xmath218 approaches the rotational velocity of circular orbits and the stellar disk is cooled .",
    "figure [ pic : spectrum - vary - n ] displays the eigenfrequencies of previous @xmath219 and @xmath220 models for @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "the spectra for the intermediate value of @xmath223 have already been shown in figures [ pic : spectrum - m2-unstable]_a _ and [ pic : spectrum - m2-vary - lambda]_a_.    increasing @xmath161 gives birth to more s - modes while the bifurcation point of the family is preserved . as a new member",
    "is born at the bifurcation point , other members including mode s1 , are pushed away from the real axis on a curved path .",
    "this behavior is observed in both models but the branch of s - family in the model with @xmath220 stays closer to the real axis than the other model .",
    "the growth rates of c - modes increase remarkably as the disk is cooled . despite mode b1 which rotates and grows faster in cold disks ,",
    "mode b2 grows faster in warmer disks .",
    "variation in the disk temperature changes the eigenfrequency of mode g more effective than what @xmath151 could , but nothing is more influential than the role of @xmath149 .",
    "another consequence of cooling the stellar disk is that @xmath186 waves are no longer stable .",
    "the parameter @xmath162 of toomre was marginally greater than unity for @xmath223 models . for @xmath222 ,",
    "i find @xmath224 over an annular region because the plot of @xmath162 versus @xmath16 exhibits a minimum at some finite radius ( e.g. , figure 7 of jh ) .",
    "for instance , i find three growing @xmath186 modes for the model @xmath225 .",
    "they correspond to pure complex eigenfrequencies @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "mode shapes have ( obviously ) ringed structures but the number of rings , which is identical to the number of peaks of @xmath229 , depends on the growth rate .",
    "the modes associated with @xmath230 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 have three , four and five rings , respectively .",
    "ring modes are very sensitive to the variations of model parameters and they are suppressed by decreasing @xmath149 and @xmath151 .      in order to simulate an immobile bulge , which does not respond to density perturbations , jh utilized an inner cutout function of the form @xmath233 where @xmath234 is an angular momentum scale . multiplying @xmath235 by the self - consistent df of the equilibrium state ,",
    "prohibits the stars with @xmath236 from participating in the perturbed dynamics .",
    "consequently , incoming waves are reflected at some finite radius and the innermost wave packets of multiple - peaked modes are diminished .",
    "my calculations show that all s - modes survive in cutout models , mode g disappears , and the growth rate of mode b2 increases .",
    "the pattern speed of mode b1 is boosted so that the corotation resonance is destroyed , but its growth rate drops drastically .",
    "figure [ pic : spectrum - cutout ] shows the eigenfrequency spectrum of a model with @xmath237 and @xmath176 .",
    "circles show the eigenfrequencies found by jh .",
    "again , the agreement between the results of jh and the present work is very good .",
    "the reason that i have identified mode b2 as the second member of b - family , and not the most unstable s - mode , is that its @xmath209 function has an evolved double - peaked structure ( see figure 11 in jh ) and its locus versus @xmath151 does not emerge from the same bifurcation frequency of s - modes .",
    "disappearance of mode g in cutout models confirms my earlier note that it is a self - gravitating mode .",
    "there are similarities between mode g of this study and toomre s ( 1981 ) mode d. both of these modes resist against stabilization by increasing the fraction of dark to luminous matter and they have at most double peaks on their spiral arms",
    ". nonetheless , these modes are not the same because mode g is amplified through a feedback from the galactic center but toomre s mode d has been identified as an edge mode .",
    "a question remains to be answered : why toomre ( 1981 ) did not detect mode g and i do not find an edge mode ?",
    "the most convincing explanation is that to excite a self - gravitating wave inside the core of the stellar component , the governing potential in that region should mainly come from the self - gravity of stars . this requirement is fulfilled in my @xmath238 models for @xmath156 .",
    "however , the completely flat rotation curve imposed by toomre ( 1981 ) nowhere follows the rotational velocity induced by the self - gravity of stars and it prohibits the gaussian disk from developing a g - like mode . on the other hand , i do nt find an edge mode because the density profile of the cored exponential disk does not decay as steep as the gaussian disk to create an outer boundary at some finite radius for reflecting the outgoing waves .",
    "similar to the first order analysis of  [ sec::linear - theory ] , polyachenko s ( 2005 ) approach results in the full spectrum of eigenfrequencies for a given azimuthal wavenumber .",
    "there are some differences between his method and the present formulation .",
    "polyachenko directly uses poisson s integral to establish a point - wise relation in the action space between the fourier components of the perturbed df and its self - consistent potential .",
    "combination of equations ( 5 ) and ( 9 ) in his paper is analogous to equation ( [ eq : expansion - v1-vs - dmlj ] ) in this paper .",
    "the main departure of the two theories is in the way that the linearized cbe is treated .",
    "polyachenko forces a point - wise fulfillment of the cbe in the action space while the present method works with a weighted residual form of the cbe .",
    "a point - wise formulation poses a challenge for the numerical calculation of the eigenvalues and their conjugate eigenvectors . according to the bar charts of jh , at least ten fourier components ( @xmath239 )",
    "are needed in the @xmath185-direction to assure a credible convergence of @xmath2 in a typical soft - centered galaxy model .",
    "therefore , if one chooses a grid of @xmath240 in the action space , polyachenko s eigenvector @xmath241 will have a dimension of @xmath242",
    ". therefore , for a _ very coarse _ grid with @xmath243 that polyachenko uses , the unknown eigenvector will have a dimension of 4410 .",
    "this number must be compared with the dimension of @xmath164 in equation ( [ eq : eigenvalue - problem - two ] ) .",
    "that is indeed @xmath244 for the most accurate calculations carried out by setting @xmath179 which means that @xmath245 fourier components in the @xmath185-direction and @xmath246 expansion terms in the @xmath16-direction have been taken into account . noting that the definite integrals @xmath126 and @xmath125 are independently evaluated over the action space with any desired accuracy , the present theory proves to be more efficient for eigenmode calculation ( in the linear regime ) than other existing alternatives .",
    "the agreement between the results of this work and those of jh , who have used kalnajs s method , is impressive .",
    "there is only a discrepancy in the results for a double - peaked spiral mode of @xmath153 models .",
    "in fact , these models have two double - peaked modes , modes b2 and g , and jh find mode b2 .",
    "the origin of discrepancies was attributed to the length scale of clutton - brock functions , @xmath53 , which is a fixed number for the whole spectrum of a given azimuthal wavenumber .",
    "provided that jh optimized @xmath53 for each growing mode that they calculated ( see also  [ sec : maximal - disk ] ) , some minor deviations from the results of this paper are reasonable . in most cases",
    "the algorithm used by jh converges to mode b1 and the fastest rotating s - mode .",
    "they capture mode b2 only if its growth rate is large enough .",
    "other modes remain unexplored because newton s method needs an initial guess of @xmath5 , which has a little chance to be in the basin of attraction of the other members of s - family .",
    "the separation of eigenfrequencies near the bifurcation point of s - modes is very small and one could anticipate complex boundaries for the basins of attraction of these eigenfrequencies . thus , there is no guarantee that successive newton s iterations keep an estimated eigenfrequency on the same basin that it was initially .",
    "nevertheless , in kalnajs s formulation , a systematic search for all growing modes is possible by introducing the mathematical eigenvalue @xcite and investigating its loci as the pattern speed and growth rate vary .",
    "after three decades of kalnajs s ( 1977 ) publication , it was not known exactly whether growing modes of stellar systems appear as distinct roots in the eigenfrequency space or they belong to continuous families as van kampen modes do . in this paper ,",
    "i attempted to answer this question using the galerkin projection of the cbe and unveiled the full eigenfrequency spectrum of a stellar disk .",
    "i showed that similar to gaseous disks @xcite , majority of growing modes emerge as _ discrete families _ through a bifurcation from stationary modes .",
    "there are some exceptions for this rule , the most important of which are the isolated bar and g modes .",
    "the model that i used to test my method allows for dark matter presence as a spherical component , whose potential inside the galactic disk contributes to the rotational velocity of stars . by varying the parameters of the model , and investigating the eigenfrequencies and their associated mode shapes",
    ", i showed that it is not the fraction of dark to luminous matter that controls the variety of growing modes .",
    "what determines that variety is indeed the shape of the dark matter density profile controlled by the parameter @xmath247 .",
    "my survey in the parameter space revealed that the concentration of dark matter in the galactic center ( @xmath203 ) destroys mode g and weakens the growth of b - modes substantially .",
    "emergence of spiral c - modes that accumulate near the galactic center is another remarkable consequence of dark matter presence in central regions of a cored stellar disk .",
    "although the solution of the galerkin system showed a credible convergence of the series expansions , the existence of strong solutions for the cbe , in its full nonlinear form , is still an open problem .",
    "it has been known for years that van kampen modes make a complete set @xcite , and therefore , they may be used for a series representation of stationary oscillations .",
    "but there is not a mathematical proof for the completeness of the discrete families of growing modes . in other words ,",
    "whether an observed galaxy can be assembled using the modes of a linear eigensystem , requires further analysis .    in the second part of this study",
    ", i will investigate the mechanisms of wave interactions in the nonlinear regime and will probe the mass and angular momentum transfer between waves of different fourier numbers .",
