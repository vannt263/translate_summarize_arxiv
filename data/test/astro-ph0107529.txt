    "two of the most fundamental measurements required to understand the nature of any star are the determination of its surface gravity and effective temperature . in the case of the white dwarf stars , where nuclear burning has long since ceased ,",
    "temperature is an indication of their cooling age and , therefore , enables us to map out the evolutionary sequence .",
    "early studies of the white dwarf population relied on photometric measurements ( e.g. koester _ et  al . _  1979",
    "however , a major break through in the reliability and accuracy of these measurements was achieved with the development of a spectroscopic technique for the h - rich da white dwarfs , pioneered by holberg _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1986 ) , where the _ iue _  observed  lyman @xmath0 lines of a number of da white dwarfs were compared with synthetic model stellar atmospheres .",
    "similar techniques can be applied to the  balmer lines ( holberg _ et  al._1985 ) .",
    "indeed , when multiple balmer lines ( usually 3 or 4 ) are systematically analysed a unique well - defined determination of both the temperature and surface gravity can be obtained .",
    "et  al._(1992 , bsl ) were the first to apply this technique to a large sample of da white dwarfs .",
    "combining the measurements of  and @xmath1 with the evolutionary calculations of wood ( 1992 ) , bsl obtained estimates of the mass for each star , confirming the narrowness of the white dwarf mass distribution and yielding an accurate measurement of its peak .",
    "subsequent studies of large samples of white dwarfs from both optical and euv surveys have firmly established this technique as the primary way of determining the da white dwarf temperature scale and placing these objects in their evolutionary context ( see vennes _",
    "et  al . _  1997",
    "; marsh _ et  al . _",
    "1997 ; finley _",
    "et  al . _",
    "1997a ) .",
    "the balmer line technique can only be applied if these features are visible in the stellar spectrum .",
    "however , there are several situations where this is not the case or where the measurement is compromised in some way . for example , if a white dwarf resides in a binary system with a much more luminous main sequence or evolved companion , the optical spectrum will be dominated by the latter star .",
    "a well - known illustration of this is the da+k star binary v471 tauri , which has been studied extensively ( e.g. barstow _ et  al . _",
    "1997 and references therein ) and where the balmer lines are not detectable in the glare of the k2 dwarf . one major result of the euv sky surveys has been the discovery of many more similar systems with companion spectral types ranging from a to k ( e.g. barstow _ et  al . _  1994a ;",
    "et  al . _  1998",
    "; burleigh _ et  al . _",
    "1997 ) .",
    "while the signature of the white dwarf can not be visually separated from its companion in these binaries , the uv flux from the degenerate star dominates that from the late - type star , provided the primary has a spectral type later than @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , most of the white dwarfs in such systems have been identified from _ iue _  spectra . in principle , the white dwarf temperature and gravity can be determined from the lyman  @xmath0 line profile in each case . however , a single line is unable to give an unambiguous measurement of both  and @xmath1 simultaneously .",
    "additional information , such as the stellar distance , can constraint the possible values further , but the distance measurements may not always be sufficiently accurate or may be based on uncertain knowledge of the primary spectral type .",
    "the importance of access to the lyman series in an unresolved binary is illustrated by determination of  and @xmath1 for several important white dwarfs including v471 tauri ( barstow _ et  al . _",
    "1997 ) and hz43 ( dupuis _ et  al . _",
    "1998 ) , based on spectra obtained by the _ orfeus_spectrometer ( see below ) .",
    "more recently , burleigh _",
    "et  al . _  ( 2001 ) have obtained  and @xmath1 for the white dwarf companion to the a star @xmath3 crateris , using _",
    "fuse_.    in principle , the full lyman line series could be used in the same manner as the balmer lines to determine  and @xmath1 .",
    "while the _ iue _  and _ hst _  bands do not extend to short enough wavelengths to encompass more than lyman @xmath0 , the short duration _",
    "hut _  and _ orfeus _",
    "missions have provided several observations of white dwarfs down to the lyman limit with which to examine this idea .",
    "hut_telescope was carried into space twice aboard the space shuttle , as part of the _ astro 1 _ and _ astro 2 _ missions .",
    "a total of eight isolated hot da white dwarfs were observed at a resolution of @xmath4(fwhm ) . launched from the space shuttle , the _ orfeus _  missions utilised a free - flying far - uv spectrometer operating at a factor 10 higher resolution ( @xmath5 ) than _ hut_. a total of four das were observed during two separate flights .",
    "several authors have used these far - uv spectra to determine and @xmath1 . however , as the total number of stars studied on any one mission has been small , it has been difficult to establish whether or not the results of lyman line analyses are generally in agreement with balmer line observations of the isolated da stars .",
    "a test of this nature is crucial if we are to routinely use lyman line data for this purpose .",
    "a preliminary investigation of this issue was carried out by finley _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1997b ) , using the _ astro 2 _ _ hut _  data .",
    "their major conclusion was that the lyman lines were significantly weaker than the standard stark broadening theory of vidal _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1973 ) .",
    "conflicting results have been obtained with the _ orfeus _  data .",
    "for example , barstow _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1998 ) , utilizing state - of - the - art non - lte models , found that the lyman and balmer  determinations were in good agreement for the heavy element rich star g191@xmath6b2b but not for the similar object rej0457@xmath6281 .",
    "et  al . _  ( 1998 ) also achieved good agreement between the results of their lyman line analysis of the pure h atmosphere white dwarf hz43 and other published values of  from a variety of published sources including _ hut _ , _ euve _  besides ground - based balmer line observations .",
    "however , it must be remembered that these measurements reported in the literature were derived using several different model codes , spanning several generations of these programmes .",
    "hence , such comparisons lack the uniformity and self - consistency required to evaluate the efficacy of the lyman lines as reliable  and @xmath1 indicators .",
    "the launch of the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ) on 1999 june 24 has provided long duration access to the lyman series region of the electromagnetic spectrum for the first time since copernicus , in the early 1970s .",
    "however , copernicus was not sufficiently sensitive to observe any white dwarfs , except sirius b. with a spectral resolution superior to both _ hut _  and _ orfeus _ , and comparable effective area , _ fuse _",
    "promises to produce lyman series data for many white dwarfs .",
    "this paper presents a critical analysis of the use of the h lyman series absorption lines to determine  and @xmath1 .",
    "we reanalyze the archival _ hut _  and _ orfeus _  spectra in conjunction with new , improved non - lte synthetic spectra , comparing the results with our archive of balmer line data , using the same models .",
    "we also consider the possible systematic observation and data reduction effects that might affect either or both balmer and lyman procedures .",
    "we have obtained far - uv spectra covering the lyman series from the @xmath3 line through to the series limit from three telescopes , _ hut _ , _ orfeus _  and _ fuse_. table  [ fuv ] summarises all the observations , which are discussed briefly below .",
    "all the spectra were obtained from the multi - mission archive ( mast , http://archive.stsci.edu/mast.html ) hosted by the space telescope science institute , or directly from the investigators of the respective instruments .",

    "[ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     [ sim ]    it is clear that there are significant differences between the measurements of  and @xmath1 for each of the simulated datasets .",
    "the systematic effects that have been introduced are typically @xmath7%  of the mean flux . these translate into observational errors @xmath8%  for  and @xmath9%  for @xmath1 . while the precision of the _ hut_measurements is similar to the level of the systematic errors ,",
    "the systematic effects clearly dominate the statistical uncertainties in the _ orfeus_analyses .",
    "it is interesting to note that the total spread of temperature measurements ( @xmath10k ) for the simulated data set is as large as some of the perceived discrepancies in the real observations .",
    "we have measured the effective temperatures and surface gravities for a sample of hot da white dwarfs using the lyman line data available from the _ hut _ , _ orfeus _  and _ fuse _  far - uv space missions , comparing the results with those from the standard balmer line technique . in general , there is good overall agreement between the two methods . at the level of the pure statistical errors , differences are found between lyman and balmer measurements for a number of stars .",
    "however , across the sample , the discrepancies are not always in the same direction .",
    "this is not what would be expected if the problems arose from limitations of the stellar atmosphere calculations and , in particular , the treatment of lyman and balmer line broadening .",
    "hence , while the description of opacity in the region of the lyman lines is still uncertain , because of uncertainties associated with the occupation probability formalism , the description of the line broadening of the isolated , lower , lyman lines seems to be in good shape .",
    "it is not necessary to make semi - arbitrary adjustments to the input physics , as carried out by finley _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1997b ) in their analysis of the _ hut _   data , to force agreement between the balmer and lyman line results .",
    "even so , there may well be residual second order effects worthy of examination .",
    "the best fit line in figure  [ all ] ( excluding problematic results noted earlier ) hints at a few percent systematic difference between balmer and lyman values of . however , this is at a similar level to the possible systematic data reduction problems discussed above , which must be eliminated before we can consider this further .",
    "it is well known that optical balmer line measurements can be sensitive to systematic effects in the data reduction process , in particular the extinction correction that must be applied to take account of atmospheric absorption as well as the absolute flux calibration . although the former problem is not present in the far - uv spectra it is apparent that this method of temperature and gravity measurement is sensitive to a number of systematic effects that can compromise these results . for example , with the lower spectral resolution _ hut",
    "_  data , the geocoronal and interstellar contamination of the line cores can not be dealt with very easily , leading to a systematic shift in measured values of . in a simulation ,",
    "inclusion of the line core regions in the analysis yielded erroneously high values of  and @xmath1 .",
    "in other cases , the accuracy of subtraction of instrument background or scattered light may be important . simulations of over- or under - subtracted background components at the level of 5%  of the mean flux give shifts of similar magnitude in the measured value of . with high signal - to - noise data available from a variety of instrumentation ,",
    "it is clear that our analyses are no longer limited by the statistical errors but by the systematic ones arising in the process of data acquisition and reduction .",
    "consequently , we conclude that , if these effects can be adequately controlled , the lyman line technique gives measurement that are consistent with those obtained from the balmer lines , when allowance is made for realistic observational uncertainties .",
    "the work reported in the papers was based on observations made with the _ hut _ , _ orfeus _   and _ fuse _   observatories .",
