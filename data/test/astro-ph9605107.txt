    "this spectrum remains well below current experimental limits for the near - infrared background ( biller et al .",

    "finally , we summarize our results on the feasibility of mapping the @xmath2-ray horizon in the tev range .",
    "recent multifrequency observations of blazars seem to support an explanation of their @xmath2-ray emission in terms of relativistic shocks propagating down an expanding jet ( at least this is a powerful and predictive working hypothesis ) .",
    "multiple shocks ( courant & friedrichs @xcite ) can form behind a magnetic nozzle ( van putten @xcite ) .",

    "( @xcite ) . in the innermost regions of the jet , at the beginning of an outburst , the shocks seem to emit an optically thin mm - to - optical synchrotron spectrum ( in some cases reaching up to soft x - rays ) with an associated x - to-@xmath2-ray spectral component which can dominate the emitted power . further down the jet ,",
    "the shocks become transparent to radio synchrotron emission so that the initial outburst shows up delayed and broadened in radio lightcurves .",
    "morphologically , the radio outbursts seem to be associated with the birth of new knots in vlbi maps . + it is tantalizing to identify the high energy spectral component with the inevitable synchrotron - self - compton emission from the traveling shocks .",
    "however , this would require that the photon energy density exceeds the magnetic energy density in sources where the @xmath2-ray luminosity exceeds the optical luminosity , i.e. @xmath28 , since @xmath29 the same conclusion @xmath28 follows from assuming that tev photons are singly scattered optical synchrotron photons .",
    "since @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we obtain @xmath32  g corresponding to the comoving - frame magnetic energy density of @xmath33erg  @xmath34 .",
    "this value is negligible compared to the comoving - frame radiation energy density @xmath35  erg  s@xmath18 ( sect.3.2 ) .",
    "however , the energy density of the relativistic electrons @xmath36 should certainly exceed the energy density @xmath37 of the photons they produce implying @xmath38 .",
    "this raises the problem of how @xmath36 can be maintained at such a high level in a quasi - stationary situation .",
    "the commonly invoked mechanism of diffusive acceleration does not operate at @xmath38 , since particles diffuse by pitch - angle scattering off magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "the pressure of these fluctuations is expected to be near the saturation value @xmath39 , thus imposing the condition @xmath40 .",
    "+ this conceptual problem with the ssc mechanism is removed if it is assumed that protons instead of electrons scatter off the synchrotron photons . in interstellar space , the energy in relativistic protons largely exceeds the energy in electrons which could also be true in radio jets .",
    "the reasons for this are unclear . however , if the proton acceleration mechanism can tap the maxwell tail of a thermal distribution ( malkov & vlk @xcite ) , it is plausible that the proton energy density will generally be larger than the electron energy density . protons in a high radiation density environment , such as the shocks presumably traveling down radio jets , produce ample pions and pairs by inelastic scattering off the electronic synchrotron photons if they reach high energies @xmath41  gev ( biermann & strittmatter 1987 ) . + the pairs and pions initiate electromagnetic cascades ( mannheim et al .",
    "1991 ) at the shocks . for a simple blandford & knigl ( 1979 ) type jet , the predicted spectra match the observed spectra from radio frequencies to @xmath2-rays very well ( mannheim 1993a ) .",
    "contrasting any other model predicting @xmath2-rays from blazars , the proton blazar model implies source spectra reaching @xmath42  tev photon energies _",
    "generally_. internal absorption of the @xmath2-rays above tev by the low energy electronic synchrotron photons leads to a steepening of the spectra by one power above tev ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the pic flux varies simultaneously with the flux of the infrared - to - optical target photons and with the proton maximum energy .",
    "+    denoting the emission volume as @xmath44 ( assumed to be equal for protons and electrons ) , the energy density ratio of protons and electrons as @xmath45 ( @xmath46 in the milky way at gev energies ) and the ratio of electron and proton cooling times as @xmath47 , the pic luminosity can be expressed in terms of the ssc luminosity eq.(1 ) by @xmath48 the cooling time ratio @xmath49 depends strongly on the maximum particle energies , since @xmath50 where @xmath2 denotes the lorentz factor of the particle . balancing cooling and expansion time scales for protons and electrons ( so that @xmath51 ) yields extremely large proton lorentz factors @xmath52 . in the case of @xmath51",
    ", the pic luminosity can exceed the ssc luminosity by the , possibly large , proton - to - electron ratio @xmath53 .",
    "a crucial requirement is , of course , that acceleration is faster than expansion and that the larmor radius of the gyrating particles does not exceed the radius of curvature of the shocks ( bell 1978 ) .",
    "the latter criterion hurts protons more than electrons , since the proton larmor radius is much larger than the electron larmor radius .",
    "if the coherent shock structure is destroyed during the nonlinear evolution of the shock propagating down the jet , proton scattering at the maximum energy becomes inefficient ( scattering length @xmath54 larmor radius in bohm diffusion ) .",
    "we therefore expect that @xmath55 is decreasing with time .",

    "the main task is to separate the air showers induced by primary @xmath2 s from the much more abundant hadronic showers .",
    "apart from detecting the charged secondary particle component using a matrix of scintillator counters , the photons of the erenkov light cone produced by relativistic electrons also give valuable complementary information about the shower and thus the incoming primary particle .",
    "whereas up to now , scintillator arrays have provided only upper limits for the flux from @xmath2-ray point sources , the employment of imaging erenkov telescopes has been the most successful ground based observation technique of the last years : observation of ultra high energy @xmath2-radiation from the crab nebula , mrk421 and mrk501 are reported . as an example for experimental setups searching for tev @xmath2-rays , we quote the results obtained by the hegra detector array located on the canary island la palma ( 28.8 n , 17.7 w , 2200 m a.s.l . ) .",
    "as it comprises a scintillator array of 224 counters , 17 geiger towers for @xmath2/hadron separation , and a @xmath57 matrix of open erenkov counters ( airobicc ) , hegra is able to equally exploit the information provided by the erenkov photons and the charged particle component of air showers .",
    "the observation of single objects is furthermore possible by the use of 3 erenkov telescopes which form the first part of a system of 5 telescopes .",
    "the operation of airobicc is restricted to clear , moonless nights , but the solid angle acceptance of about 1 sr allows to observe a large number of sources simultaneously . as airobicc and",
    "scintillator arrays are sensitive to different physical properties of air showers , they have different energy thresholds : the scintillator array detects showers with more than about 40 tev energy of the primary particle , the threshold for airobicc is at about 20 tev . as a consequence of the lower erenkov light yield and",
    "larger fluctuations in proton showers , the threshold energy for proton induced showers exceeds the @xmath2-shower thresholds by about 10 tev .",

    "+ current data analysis applying cuts on the basis of @xmath2/hadron- separation techniques ( westerhoff et al .",

    "accounting for absorption , the theoretical flux drops by roughly an order of magnitude lower .",
    "it is difficult to assess the systematical errors in the determination of the experimental flux sensitivity , but they can be estimated to be quite large . since the theoretical errors are also difficult to control better than within factors of @xmath67a few by the very nature of the variable blazars , a detection of blazars at @xmath6750  tev does not seem beyond reach . on the other hand , very strong absorption , such as proposed by stecker et al .",
