    "if a quark gluon plasma is created in a collision of two large nuclei , it eventually has to hadronize again .",
    "the detectors in our experiments can only measure the hadronic debris from this collision .",
    "a direct observation of the plasma is not possible .",
    "there has been a long discussion over the past 25 years what the possible signatures of a phase transition from a quark gluon plasma might be .",
    "we give a short ( and probably incomplete ) list of some of the more popular ideas :    * indirect measurements of thermodynamical quantities like the latent heat of the phase transition . *",
    "the enhanced production of strange particles .",
    "* modifications of hadron properties , like the mass and width of the @xmath10 meson , through the presence of hot nuclear matter . * the detection of thermal photon or dilepton radiation from a thermalized qgp . * the suppression of quarkonia like the @xmath11 . * the energy loss of fast partons in a qgp , the so called jet quenching . * fluctuations in net charge or baryon number . *",
    "collective vacuum excitations like the disoriented chiral condensate ( dcc ) .    in the following",
    "we discuss some of these ideas .",
    "one of the simplest approaches one can think of is to measure quantities that are thermodynamically related to the phase transition , like the latent heat .",
    "a very interesting observation has been made regarding the slope of hadron spectra .",
    "hadron spectra at low transverse momenta  below several gev/@xmath0 , can be described phenomenologically by a blast wave fit @xcite .",
    "this assumes a thermalized spectrum with an effective temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the spectrum is additionally boosted by a collective radial flow .",
    "the data collected for kaons at different energies seem to indicate that a plateau in the temperature was reached at sps energies , while at higher rhic energies the temperature is again rising . this could be interpreted as latent heat that is used to free the additional partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "one of the classical signatures of the qgp is strangeness enhancement @xcite .",
    "since the strangeness content of the colliding nuclei in the initial state is nearly negligible , all strange particles in the final state have to be generated in the collision . in purely hadronic matter , e.g.  kaons and @xmath12s have to be produced through hadronic channels . in a quark gluon plasma , @xmath13 pairs will be created .",
    "this is enhanced by the relatively small strange quark mass @xmath14 in the chirally restored phase .",
    "the strange quarks will then hadronize into strange hadrons and lead to higher yields compared to the hadronic scenario .",
    "this can already be seen at the cern sps @xcite .",
    "it was argued by matsui and satz @xcite , that the disappearance of quarkonia states is a signal for the qgp .",
    "lattice calculations show that the heavy quark potential is effectively screened in a plasma above @xmath6 , so that @xmath15 bound states are melting @xcite .",
    "it is then unlikely that the @xmath15 will find together at hadronization .",
    "instead , they will mostly end up in open charm states .",
    "however , already at rhic energies charm quarks could be so abundant , that spontaneous recombination of @xmath15 pairs could occur if @xmath0 quarks thermalize in the medium @xcite .",
    "that would alter the suppression scenario and could even lead to a @xmath11 enhancement .",
    "fast partons produced in hard qcd interactions between the two colliding nuclei have to travel through the hot and dense medium surrounding them .",
    "it was proposed very early by bjorken @xcite , that these partons lose energy by interactions with the medium , see fig .",
    "[ fig : enloss ] .",
    "this `` jet quenching '' was studied in a series of theoretical papers over the last 10 years @xcite .",
    "the main process is the induced radiation of gluon bremsstrahlung by interactions with the hot nuclear matter .",
    "this results in a suppression of hadron production at @xmath16 gev .",
    "furthermore , since for strong energy loss the emission of high-@xmath17 hadrons is dominated by surface emission , the correlated backside jet nearly vanishes .",
    "this was confirmed at rhic @xcite .",
    "[ fig : raa ] shows the nuclear suppression factor @xmath18 for pions which is defined as the particle yield in au+au collisions normalized by the yield in @xmath19 collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "if a heavy ion collision were just a superposition of individual nucleon - nucleon collisions , @xmath18 would be 1 . in recent",
    "@xmath20au control experiments , where no qgp is expected to be produced , indeed , no suppression in the hadron yield and back - to - back correlations similar to @xmath19 collisions were found @xcite .         for @xmath21 measured by the phenix collaboration @xcite in au+au collisions at rhic for two different centrality bins .",
    "a large suppression can be observed for central collisions , width=302 ]    theoretically , the effect of energy loss for hadron spectra can be described by medium modifications in the fragmentation function of a parton @xmath22 into hadron @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this modification approximately corresponds to a rescaling of the variable @xmath24 @xmath25 theory predicts that the energy loss is quadratically dependent on the length of the medium due to the so - called non - abelian landau - pomeranchuk - migdal interference effect @xcite .",
    "besides the search for standard qgp signatures and the confirmation of long standing theoretical expectations , experimental results from rhic have provided many surprises . in this section",
    "we want to discuss the anomalous baryon enhancement and the elliptic flow pattern found at rhic .",
    "it was widely assumed that hadron production at rhic for @xmath16 gev can be described by perturbative qcd .",
    "this seemed to work well for pions if all known nuclear corrections , like shadowing and energy loss , are taken into account . on the other hand ,",
    "protons and antiprotons deviate from this behavior . in a scenario with partonic energy loss",
    ", the suppression of @xmath26 and @xmath27 should be the same as for pions .",
    "furthermore , pqcd would predict a ratio @xmath28 .",
    "rhic results show that the @xmath29 ratio is about 1 between 1.5 and 4.5 gev/@xmath0 , and that there is nearly no nuclear suppression in the yield of protons in this transverse momentum region @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior was found in the strangeness sector for @xmath12s and kaons @xcite .",
    "an important quantity that can be measured in heavy ion collisions is the azimuthal anisotropy . at nonzero impact parameter @xmath30 ,",
    "the overlap zone of the two nuclei is not spherically symmetric .",
    "the initial anisotropy translates into an anisotropy of the final hadron spectra .",
    "this can be quantified by an expansion of the spectrum into harmonics @xmath31 the coefficient @xmath32 describes the elliptic anisotropy in the spectrum .",
    "@xmath32 has been measured in rhic experiments and shows a surprising dependence on the hadron species . as a function of @xmath17 it rises and saturates above 2 gev/@xmath0 .",
    "the value of saturation is always larger for baryons compared to mesons @xcite .",
    "it is believed that at these and higher values of @xmath17 the mechanism for translating the initial anisotropy into a final one is again partonic energy loss .",
    "partons going into a direction where the interaction zone is less extended will suffer less energy loss . however , this mechanism should be blind to the hadron species .",
    "the results above suggest that the range of validity for leading twist perturbative qcd calculations only starts at higher transverse momentum . instead , the baryon enhancement and the azimuthal flow pattern can be understood in a simple picture of parton recombination @xcite . in pqcd hadronization",
    "happens through fragmentation . a single parton with momentum @xmath26 splits into gluons and @xmath33 pairs that eventually form hadrons .",
    "one of these hadrons is then measured and has momentum @xmath34 , ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the hadron spectrum is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the spectrum of partons @xmath22 and @xmath38 is the parton momentum .",
    "on the other hand , if phase space is already densely populated with partons , these can simply recombine to give mesons @xmath39 and baryons @xmath40 @xmath41 in this case , the momenta of the valence partons add up .",
    "quantitatively this can be formulated in a coalescence formalism using hadron wave functions @xmath42 in light cone coordinates @xcite . for a meson",
    "@xmath39 the spectrum can be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a degeneracy factor , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the phase space distributions of the recombining quark and antiquark respectively , @xmath47 is the momentum fraction of the quark in light cone coordinates and @xmath48 is the hadronization hypersurface in minkowski space .",
    "it can be shown that recombination is always more effective than fragmentation for an exponential parton spectrum , but fragmentation will dominate at high @xmath17 for a parton spectrum in power law form . furthermore , for an exponential parton spectrum @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 in the case of a meson @xmath39 and analogously @xmath51 in the case of a baryon @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath52 here always denotes the large component of the hadron momentum on the light cone .",
    "hence recombination naturally provides a ratio @xmath53 .",
    "we should add that the description of recombination given above is only valid if @xmath52 is much larger than @xmath54 and the masses of the hadrons .",
    "[ fig : chhadrhic ] shows the result of a calculation for charged hadrons at rhic using recombination from a thermalized phase of constituent quarks with a temperature @xmath55 mev and an average radial flow velocity @xmath56 and fragmentation in a leading order pqcd calculation including energy loss .",
    "one can clearly see the two different domains of hadron production . only above @xmath57",
    "gev/@xmath0 is leading twist pqcd a good description for hadron production . below that recombination",
    "is important .",

    "data are from star @xcite and phenix @xcite.,width=302 ]    for the recombination of partons , one can derive a simple scaling law that connects the azimuthal anisotropy @xmath32 for partons @xmath26 and hadrons @xmath23",
    "@xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 for mesons and @xmath60 for baryons .",
    "this scaling law which was recently confirmed by the star and phenix collaborations @xcite , can be considered as a new `` smoking gun '' for the creation of a quark gluon plasma .",
    "the scaling law visualizes the anisotropic flow in the parton phase before hadronization .",
    "at lhc lead nuclei will collide with a center of mass energy @xmath61 tev .",
    "this leads to a much higher initial energy density .",
    "higher energy density and increased lifetime will make initial state effects less important , but will also enhance the role of the qgp phase over final state hadronic interactions . on the other hand , probes with very high transverse momentum ,",
    "up to 100 gev/@xmath0 , will be available and it might be possible to measure jets @xcite . also heavy @xmath0 and @xmath62 quarks are plentiful probes at this energy .",
    "the relevance of saturation of the nuclear wave function @xcite has already been discussed at lower energies .",
    "it is clear that lhc will be the ideal testing ground for saturation physics .",
    "the basic idea is that the gluon distribution in a qcd bound state can not continuously grow fast at small bjorken @xmath47 without violating unitarity .",
    "at some point , gluon fusion will balance the growth .",
    "the scale at which the probability of gluon interactions in the nucleus wave function becomes of the order of one determines the saturation scale @xmath63 @xcite @xmath64 from this equation one obtains the scaling with the nuclear size @xmath65 . starting from these assumptions various phenomenological consequences have been derived @xcite for qcd at large @xmath66 .",
    "see e.g.   @xcite for an overview .",
    "saturation has also to be taken into account , when one of the fundamental questions is addressed : what are the particle multiplicities we can expect at lhc ?",
    "this is very important for the detector design .",
    "estimates have been given in @xcite using perturbative qcd and saturation .",
    "it is expected that the effect of jet quenching at lhc is even larger than at rhic due to the higher energy density in the medium .",
    "estimates depending on the produced particle multiplicity show that quenching factors of 1030 can occur for pions at @xmath67 gev @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , hard qcd will be an important part of the heavy ion program at lhc .",
    "it might be possible to measure jets directly , as it is done in @xmath68 and @xmath69 collisions .",
    "that eliminates the uncertainty coming from fragmentation functions in theoretical calculations and could be a valuable contribution to our understanding of energy loss in the medium @xcite .",
    "the large nuclear suppression factor raises the question whether `` soft '' thermal physics will push its limits to even higher @xmath17 at lhc .",
    "preliminary studies with recombination from a thermalized parton phase confirm this . figs .",

    "the baryon enhancement is pushed to higher @xmath17 for lhc.,width=302 ]      once partonic energy loss is established , one would like to measure properties of the qgp by using hard qcd probes .",
    "one sort of precision measurements could be photon - tagged jets or hadrons . for this one considers the back - to - back production of a parton and a photon , e.g.  @xmath73 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jetphottag ] . due to the weakness of electromagnetic interactions ,",
    "the photon can leave the medium unaffected , while the outgoing parton will suffer from final state interactions . by momentum conservation the transverse momentum of",
    "the photon is equal to the initial momentum of the outgoing parton directly after the production .",
    "but the parton will suffer from energy loss before it can hadronize . by tagging a reference photon and looking at hadrons or jets at the opposite side , precision measurements of energy loss",
    "will be possible @xcite . the same measurement can be done with back - to - back production of a parton and a virtual photon , which then decays into a lepton pair @xcite .",
    "another promising idea is to measure induced photon radiation from fast partons interacting with the medium @xcite .",
    "it is characteristic for the born cross sections for these processes , e.g.   @xmath74  see fig .",
    "[ fig : jetphotconv ]  that they peak in forward and backward directions ( in the center of mass frame ) .",
    "that means that the three - momentum of the photon is very close to one of the two initial momenta .",
    "if one restricts the measurement of the photon to large transverse momentum , say @xmath75 gev/@xmath0 , then the momentum of the photon will be that of the fast parton .",
    "this jet - photon conversion mechanism is another opportunity to measure the momentum of a fast parton in the plasma .",
    "this time the photon emission will take place while this parton is traveling through the plasma and , in order to obtain the photon rate , one has to integrate over the path of the parton .",
    "therefore this measurement is sensitive to the evolution of density and temperature of the medium .",
    "it has been estimated that photons from this conversion mechanism are shining quite brightly at rhic and lhc compared to other photon sources , cf .",

    "we have discussed several key issues of heavy ion physics .",
    "while we might already discover the quark gluon plasma at rhic , it will be at lhc that we can systematically study its properties by making use of the the plentiful hard probes .",
    "some important questions have to be addressed .    *",
    "how does gluon saturation work at small @xmath47 ? * how exactly are fragmentation functions modified in the medium ?",
    "* how does the energy loss depend on the energy density ? * are heavy quarks thermalized ? * what is the role of nuclear higher twist effects ?",
