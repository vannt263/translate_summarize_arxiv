    "observations of galaxies in optical wavebands are strongly influenced by selective extinction which is hard to take into account due to inhomogeneous distribution of dust . by this reason",
    "the maps of color and brightness may give distorted picture of photometrical structure of galaxies and distribution of star - formation tracers .    in paper",
    "@xcite it was proposed to use the combined color index @xmath1 whose value does nt depend on selective attennuation of light to trace the structure of galaxies .",
    "in general case for photometric bands a , b , c one can define combined index @xmath2 as    @xmath3    to make it as far insensitive to extinction as possible . here",
    "@xmath4 is the ratio of color excesses .",
    "we have assumed its values for vbri system to be equal to standart values for our galaxy according to @xcite : @xmath5 = 0.840 , @xmath6 = 0.413 , @xmath7 = 2.033 , @xmath8 = 0.681 . as it was shown in @xcite , these ratioes",
    "do not depend practically on whether we observe the source through the dust screen or dust and stars are well mixed .",
    "similar approach was later used in @xcite to investigate the structure of m 51 .",
    "two spiral galaxies - and were observed in bvri colors ( cousins system ) 21 - 22 jan 1988 at 1-m reflector of special astrophysical observatory of russian academy of science . ccd camera 512x512 with scale 0.\"37/pix was used .",
    "data processing was carried out with the help of midas package .",
    "asymmetric distribution of colors on the color maps of and gives evidence that they are dusty objects .",
    "combined colors indices do not describe neither `` real '' colors nor the value of the extinction .",
    "they may be considered as some conditional color indices free ( or nearly free ) of color excesses .",
    "the values of @xmath2 depend on stellar population , stellar abundances and , if r band is involved , on the presence of @xmath9 emission ( see @xcite ) .    as an illustration ,",
    "fig.1a shows how the values of @xmath10 , @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath11 change when young stars formed in the single burst with the age t=0.1 gyr are overlapped onto the the old population ( t=13 gyr ) for different relative mass of young stars .",
    "the evolution program by + g.worthey ( see @xcite ) was used adopting salpeter imf and [ fe / h]=0 .",
    "fig.1b illustrates the dependence of q s on the burst ages for a fixed ( 1@xmath12 ) fraction of young stars .",
    "fig 1c shows a variation of q s with the adopted metallicity of the old population for the same parameters of burst as in fig 1b .",
    "as it follows from figures 1a - 1c , @xmath0 is the most sensitive to the fraction of young stars .",
    "the change of @xmath1 is less significant , but on the other hand this index should allow to localize giant emission regions where @xmath13 line locally increases r luminosity of the disk .    in fig.2 and 3 the maps of @xmath0 and @xmath1 distribution for our galaxies are presented .",
    "maps are bounded by the ellipses whose major axes equal to @xmath14 .",
    "they appear to be much more symmetrically distributed than color indices .",
    "curiously a ring - like zone at about 15 \" ( 4.7 kpc for @xmath15 ) from the center appears in which is not noticeable at the color maps .",
    "it enables to consider this system as the galaxy , where star formation is enhanced in the ring .",
    "note that is absent in catalog of a ring galaxies by @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath1 map of reveals a clear 3-armed spiral - like structure where the values of @xmath1 have local maxima which may be explained by enhanced emission in @xmath13 ( local equivalent width @xmath16 100 @xmath17 ) .",
    "however blue stars do not form a clear spiral structure in this region as one can see from @xmath0 map of the galaxy .",
    "we can compare the relative intensity of star formation in different regions of a galaxy using @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 diagram .",
    "the toy - model of a galaxy with exponential decreasing @xmath18 was developed using worthey s program ( from @xcite ) .",
    "the model values of q s which do not take into account recently formed stars ( t @xmath19 @xmath20 yr ) are shown by continious curve in fig.4 .",
    "dashed curve shows the values of the combined indices when the burst of sf is added to the previous model ( young population contains 30@xmath12 of the mass of the background population , has solar metallicity and the age of 0.1 gyr ) . the arrow in fig.4 . shows how @xmath21 emission shifts the point in the diagramm .",
    "the model curves show that the increasing of the fraction of young stellar population change mostly @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand the @xmath22 shifts points horizontally .",
    "it enables to use the diagram as the diagnostic one for comparizon of star formation in different parts of a galaxy .    as an example we put average values of q s for more than hundred points of central region ( diamond ) , regions of sf - ring ( triangle ) and outer regions ( square ) of on the diagram in fig.4 .",
    "mean errors of position of the points is about @xmath23 .",
    "regions in the center and in the sf - ring have the same @xmath0 which enables to conclude that they have similar fraction of young stars .",
    "the difference in @xmath1 may be explained by the presence of @xmath24 emission ( local @xmath25 ) .",
    "the outer regions of the galaxy contain a less amount of blue stars .",
    "these examples illustrate the ability to investigate structure and distribution of star formation tracers in dusty galaxies using optical broad - band photometry .",
    "combined photometrical indices @xmath0 and @xmath1 which are weakly affected by the selective extinction may be used successfully to restore the photometrical structure of galaxies with non - homogeneous dust distribution , even if their dust - free colors remain unknown .",
    "index @xmath0 depends on the presence of blue stars which enables to use it to localize regions of recent star formation . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath1 weakly depends on the light of blue stars but is sensitive to young star population through the emission in @xmath9 line . whereas color distribution is asymmetric in and due to internal absorption , their @xmath0 and @xmath1 maps are relatively symmetric and allow to reveal structure details hidden by the dust . in a ring - like region evidently related to active star formation is clearly visible at q - maps . in three armed spiral structure and active star formation",
