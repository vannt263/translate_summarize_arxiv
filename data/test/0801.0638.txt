    "recent observations of type ia supernova ( snia ) provide the main evidence that current universe is in an accelerating phase of expansion @xcite .",
    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data indicate that the present universe has also negligible space curvature @xcite .",
    "therefore if we assume the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model in which effects of nonhomogeneities are neglected , then the acceleration must be driven by dark energy component @xmath1 ( matter fluid violating the strong energy condition @xmath2 .",
    "this kind of energy represents roughly @xmath3 of the matter content of the current universe . because the nature as well as mechanism of the cosmological origin of the dark energy component are unknown some alternative theories try to eliminate the dark energy by modifying the theory of gravity itself .",
    "the main prototype of this kind of model is covariant brane models based on the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model @xcite as generalized to cosmology by deffayet @xcite .",
    "the simplest explanation of a dark energy component is the cosmological constant with effective equation of state @xmath4 but appears the problem of its smallness and hence its relatively recent dominance .",
    "although the @xmath0cdm model offers possibility of explanation of observational data it is only effective theory which contain the enigmatic theoretical term  the cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "other numerous candidates for dark energy description have also been proposed like to evolving scalar field @xcite usually referred as quintessence , the phantom energy @xcite , the chaplygin gas @xcite etc .",
    "some authors believed that the dark energy problem belongs to the quantum gravity domain @xcite .",
    "these theoretical models are consistent with the observations , they are able to explain the phenomenon of the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "but should we really prefer such models over the @xmath0cdm one ? to answer this question we should use some model comparison methods to confront existing cosmological models having observations at hand .    let us assume that we have @xmath5 pairs of measurements @xmath6 and that we want to find the relation between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 quantities .",
    "suppose that we can postulate @xmath9 possible relations @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the vector of unknown model parameters and @xmath12 . with the assumption that our observations come with uncorrelated gaussian errors with mean @xmath13 and standard deviation @xmath14 the goodness of fit for the theoretical model is measured by the @xmath15 quantity given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the likelihood function . for the particular family of models @xmath18 the best one minimize the @xmath15 quantity , which we denote @xmath19",
    ". the best model from our set of @xmath9 models @xmath20 could be the one with the smallest value of @xmath15 quantity .",
    "but this method could give us misleading results . generally speaking for more complex model",
    "the value of @xmath15 is smaller , thus the most complex one will be choose as the best from our set under consideration .",
    "a clue is given by so called occam s razor principle : `` if two models describe the observations equally well , choose the simplest one . ''",
    "this principle has aesthetic as well as empirical justification .",
    "let us quote simple example which illustrate this rule @xcite and present it in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we see the black box and the white one behind it .",
    "one can postulate two models : 1 .",
    "there is one box behind the black box , 2 .",
    "there are two boxes of identical height and colour behind the black box .",
    "both models explain our observations equally well . according to the occam s razor principle",
    "we should accept the explanation which is simpler so that there is only one white box behind the black one .",
    "is not it more probable that there is only one box than two boxes with the same height and colour ?",
    "we could not use this principle directly because the situations when two models explain the observations equally well are rare .",
    "but in the information theory as well as in the bayesian theory there are methods for model comparison which include such rule .    in the information theory",
    "there are no true models .",
    "there is only reality which can be approximated by models , which depend on some number of parameters .",
    "the best one from the set under consideration should be the best approximation to the truth .",
    "the information lost when truth is approximated by model under consideration is measured by so called kullback - leibler ( kl ) information so the best one should minimizes this quantity .",
    "it is impossible to compute the kl information directly because it depends on truth which is unknown .",
    "akaike @xcite found approximation to the kl quantity which is called the akaike information criterion ( aic ) and is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the maximum of the likelihood function and @xmath23 is the number of model parameters .",
    "model which is the best approximation to the truth from the set under consideration has the smallest value of the aic quantity .",
    "it is convenient to evaluate the differences between the aic quantities computed for the rest of models from our set and the aic for the best one .",
    "those differences ( @xmath24 ) are easy to interpret and allow a quick ` strength of evidence ' for considered model with respect to the best one .",
    "the models with @xmath25 have substantial support ( evidence ) , those where @xmath26 have considerably less support , while models having @xmath27 have essentially no support with respect to the best model .",
    "it is worth noting that the complexity of the model is interpreted here as the number of its free parameters that can be adjusted to fit the model to the observations .",
    "if models under consideration fit the data equally well according to the akaike rule the best one is with the smallest number of model parameters ( the simplest one in such an approach ) .    in the bayesian framework the best model ( from the model set under consideration )",
    "is that which has the largest value of probability in the light of data ( so called posterior probability ) @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a prior probability for the model @xmath30 , @xmath31 is normalization constant [ @xmath32 , @xmath33 denotes data .",
    "@xmath34 is the marginal likelihood , also called evidence @xmath35 where @xmath36 is likelihood under model @xmath37 , @xmath38 is prior probability for @xmath39 under model @xmath37 .",
    "let us note that we can include the occam s razor principle by assuming the greater prior probability for simpler model , but this is not necessary and rarely used in practice .",
    "usually one assume that there is no evidence to favor one model over another which cause to equal value of prior for all models under consideration .",
    "it is convenient to evaluate the posterior ratio for models under consideration which in the case with flat prior for models is reduced to the evidence ratio ( so called the bayes factor @xmath40 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the logarithm of bayes factor values are as follows : @xmath41 as a weak , @xmath42 as a positive , @xmath43 as a strong and @xmath44 as a very strong evidence in favor better model .",
    "this quantity involves the occam s razor rule .",
    "let us simplify the problem to illustrate how this principle works here @xcite .",
    "assume that @xmath45 is the non normalized posterior probability for the vector @xmath11 of model parameters .",
    "in this notation @xmath46 .",
    "suppose that posterior has a strong pick in the maximum : @xmath47 .",
    "it is reasonable to approximate the logarithm of the posterior by its taylor expansion in the neighbour of @xmath47 so we finished with the expression @xmath48,\\ ] ] where @xmath49_{ij}=-\\left[\\frac{\\partial^2\\ln\\bar{p}(\\bar{\\theta}|d , m)}{\\partial\\theta_i\\partial\\theta_j}\\right]_{\\bar{\\theta}=\\bar{\\theta}_\\text{mod}}$ ] .",
    "posterior is approximated by the gaussian distribution with the covariance matrix @xmath50 and the mean @xmath51 .",
    "the expression for the evidence take a form @xmath52d \\ \\bar{\\theta}.$ ] because the posterior has a strong pick near the maximum , the most contribution to the integral comes from the neighbour close to @xmath51 .",
    "contribution from the other other region of @xmath11 can be ignored , so we can expand the limit of the integral to whole @xmath53 . with this",
    "assumptions one can obtain @xmath54 . suppose that the likelihood function has sharp pick in @xmath55 and the prior for @xmath11 is nearly flat in the neighbour of @xmath55 . in this case",
    "@xmath56 and the expression for the evidence takes the form @xmath57 . the @xmath58 quantity is called the occam factor ( of ) . when we consider the case with one model parameter with flat prior @xmath59 the occam factor of@xmath60 which can be interpreted as the ratio of the volume occupied by the posterior to the volume occupied by prior in the parameter space . the more parameter space wasted by the prior the smaller value of the evidence .",
    "it is worth noting that the evidence does not penalize parameters which are unconstrained by the data @xcite .    as the evidence is hard to evaluation an approximation to this quantity",
    "was proposed by schwarz @xcite so called bayesian information criterion ( bic ) and is given by @xmath61 where @xmath5 is the number of the data points .",
    "the best model from the set under consideration is this which minimize the bic quantity .",
    "it is also convenient to analyse the difference between bic quantities for the rest models from our set with the bic for the best one .",
    "these differences could be interpreted in the following way : @xmath62 as a weak , @xmath63 as a positive , @xmath64 as a strong and @xmath65 as a very strong evidence in favour of a better model .",
    "one can notice the similarity between the aic and bic quantities though they come from different approaches to model selection problem .",
    "the dissimilarity is seen in the so called penalty term : @xmath66 , which penalize more complex models ( complexity is identified here as the number of free model parameters ) .",
    "one can evaluated the factor by which the additional parameter must improve the goodness of fit to be included in the model .",
    "this factor must be greater than @xmath67 so equal to @xmath68 in the aic case and equal to @xmath69 in the bic case .",
    "notice that the latter depends on the number of the data points .",
    "it should be pointed out that presented model selection methods are widely used in context of cosmological model comparison @xcite .",
    "we should keep in mind that conclusions based on such quantities depend on the data at hand .",
    "let us mention again the example with the black box .",
    "suppose that we made a few steps toward this box that we can see the difference between the height of the left and right side of the white box .",
    "our conclusion change now .",
    "let us quote example taking from @xcite .",
    "assume that we want to compare the newtonian and einsteinian theories in the light of the data coming from laboratory experiment where general relativistic effects are negligible .",
    "in this situation bayes factor between newtonian and einsteinian theories will be close to unity . whereas comparing the general relativistic and newtonian explanations of the deflection of a light ray that just grazes the sun s surface give the bayes factor @xmath70 in the favor of the first one ( and even greater with more accurate data ) .",
    "having this in mind an interesting supplement to the above considerations seems to be quantity which measure the effective number of model parameters ( c@xmath71 ) that the given data set can constrain @xcite .",
    "it can be computed using the relation @xmath72 where the mean is taken over the posterior pdf for @xmath11 and @xmath55 is the mode of the posterior pdf ( different choices are also possible ) . as have been shown this quantity correspond to the number of parameters for which the width of the posterior probability distribution is significantly narrower than the width of the prior probability distribution @xcite .",
    "these parameters can be considered to have been well measured by the data given our prior assumption in the model .",
    "it helps to determine if the data is informative enough to measure the parameters under consideration .    we share with george efstathiou opinion @xcite that there is no sound theoretical basis for considering the dynamical dark energy , where as we are beginning to see an explanation for a small cosmological constant emerging from more fundamental theory . in our opinion",
    "the @xmath0cdm model has the status of satisfactory effective theory .",
    "estathiou argued why the cosmological constant should be given higher weight as a candidate for dark energy description than dynamical dark energy . in this argumentation occam s razor",
    "is used to point out a more economical model explaining the observational data .",
    "on the other hand biesiada advocated the use of akaike information criterion which favour rather a dynamical model of dark energy ( quintessence model ) @xcite . in our opinion quantification of occam s razor by computing bayesian evidence and bayesian information criterion is more suitable as the aic is unadequate for many statistical problems @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to compare the simplest cosmological model  the @xmath0cdm model  with its generalisation where the interaction between dark energy and dark matter sector is allowed using methods described above .",
    "the interacting interpretation of continuity condition ( conservation condition ) was investigated in the context of the coincidence problem since the paper zimdahl @xcite , for recent developments in this area see olivares et al .",
    "@xcite , see also le delliou et al .",
    "@xcite for discussion recent observational constraints .",
    "let us consider two basic equations which determine the evolution of frw cosmological models @xmath73 @xmath74 equation ( [ eq:1a ] ) is called the accelerated equation and equation ( [ eq:1b ] ) is the conservation ( or adiabatic ) condition . equation ( [ eq:1a ] ) can be rewritten to the form analogous to the newtonian equation of motion @xmath75 where @xmath76 is potential function of the scale factor @xmath67 . to evaluate @xmath77 from ( [ eq:2 ] ) via integration by parts",
