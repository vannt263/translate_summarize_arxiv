    "with exoplanet detection rates soaring , it is now becoming increasingly possible to characterise these alien worlds .",
    "part of this characterisation will undoubtedly involve determining if exoplanets have their own moons , so called exomoons .",
    "the theoretical foundations of exomoon detection using transits were first laid down by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in these papers , the emerging theme of using transit timing variation ( ttv ) as a detection tool was advocated . in our previous paper , @xcite ( hereafter k09 )",
    ", we showed that an exomoon should induce not only a transit time variation ( ttv ) effect but also a transit duration variation ( tdv ) effect on the host planet .",
    "the two effects were predicted to exhibit a @xmath5 phase difference which could be used as the hallmark signature of an exomoon .    in our previous work ,",
    "an underlying assumption was coplanarity within the system .",
    "we assumed that both the planet s orbital inclination angle , @xmath6 , was @xmath7 and that the moon s orbit was completely coplanar with the planet - star orbit . in this paper",
    ", we will extend the theoretical framework to include non - coplanarity . as a result of this consideration",
    ", we predict that the tdv effect due to an exomoon has infact two primary constituents : i ) a velocity ( v ) component ii ) a transit impact parameter ( tip ) component .",
    "the v - component is the same effect we described in our previous work , where the velocity of the planet is perturbed by the moon s presence .",
    "the tip - component is a new effect which is due to the planet moving between higher and lower impact parameters as a result of the wobbling .",
    "since transit duration is a strong function of impact parameter , then even slight changes can induce a tdv effect .",
    "this additional tdv component acts constructively with the v - component in the case of a prograde exomoon orbit and destructively for a retrograde orbit . with most large moons taking prograde orbits within the solar system",
    ", it would seem reasonable to expect constructive interference to be the typical case . as a result ,",
    "the expected tdv signal from an exomoon is even more detectable .",
    "furthermore , we predict this asymmetry could allow for a determination of the satellite s sense of orbital motion .",
    "in general , we posit that there exists two dominant components of the tdv effect .",
    "the v - component is caused by an exomoon perturbing the planet s velocity as it orbits the host star .",
    "this effect was discussed in depth in our previous paper and details can be found in k09 .",
    "the second effect is the one we will concentrate on in this work and we label it as the transit impact parameter ( tip ) component .",
    "consider a side - on view of a planetary transit as shown in figure 1 .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite , the transit duration is a strong function of the impact parameter of the transit , @xmath8 , which is given by :    @xmath9    the variable @xmath10 is shown in figure 1 and denotes the distance between the observer s line - of - sight to the planet s centre , during the transit .",
    "it is this distance , @xmath10 , which the transit duration is particularly sensitive to . if @xmath11 , the planet transits across the star s equator , which is the star s widest point , thus giving a very long transit duration .",
    "if @xmath12 , then the planet only grazes the star during the transit event and so we expect a very short duration .     and the exomoon is not shown .",
    "the wobble of the planet is represented by the two grey spheres , ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , being the planet s maximal positions .",
    "the presence of a moon causes distance a perturbation in the distance @xmath10.__,width=8 ]    now consider adding an exomoon . as discussed in our previous work",
    ", the exomoon is likely to be too small to observe directly , but its gravitational effects on the host planet will be quite visible . consider placing a moon around the planet such that the planet - moon orbital plane is the same as the star - planet orbital plane . due to the moon s presence , the planet will exhibit reflex motion , or put simply a wobble , in this plane . from figure 1 , it is clear that a component of this perturbation will be in the @xmath13-direction .",
    "the motion along the @xmath13-axis is of particular interest because we have already discussed how sensitive the transit duration is to the distance @xmath10 .",
    "any motion in this direction will cause @xmath10 to get periodically larger and smaller .",
    "ergo , the transit duration will vary .    in the proposed case",
    ", we consider an exomoon with an orbit coaligned to a planet - star plane at an orbital inclination angle @xmath6 , where @xmath1 .",
    "it is clear to see that there will , in general , always be a component of @xmath13-axis wobbling motion for other moon inclinations .",
    "one of the special cases where this will not occur is when @xmath0 and the moon takes a coplanar orbit , which is precisely the case we considered in our previous work .",
    "in our updated model , we consider a planetary orbit where @xmath1 .",
    "we derive the total tdv effect by considering several stages of geometric manipulation of the planet s motion .",
    "we use the same reference axes in figure 1 where the observer is at @xmath14 , the planet - moon barycentre s true anomaly is @xmath15 , and the planet s true anomaly around the planet - moon barycentre is @xmath16 . in appendix",
    "a , we briefly consider the effects of inclined moon orbits , but for the mathematically simpler ( and possibly more probable ) case of a co - aligned moon orbit , it is shown that we may write the position of the planet as :    @xmath17 \\cos i\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the planet to star and planet to planet - moon barycentre separations respectively .",
    "note that we adopt the same notation as our previous paper direction rather than the negative ] .",
    "@xmath10 is nominally given by @xmath20 ( see equation 1 ) , but here we consider that @xmath10 has been perturbed by the moon s presence to a new value given by @xmath21 .",
    "we denote the perturbation itself by @xmath22 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the true anomaly at the moment of mid - transit , given by @xmath25 .    without a moon , we would simply have @xmath26 and thus @xmath27 , i.e. no perturbation .",
    "defining @xmath28 , according to the directions in figure 1 , we now have @xmath29 :    @xmath30    note that @xmath31 represents a shift in the @xmath32-direction whereas @xmath33 is a shift in the @xmath34-direction .",
    "as expected , for @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 . for a highly inclined moon orbit ,",
    "it is worth noting that the maximal value of @xmath22 will be @xmath37 .",
    "consider the planet - moon barycentre moving in the @xmath38-direction in figure 1 .",
    "for a prograde orbit , the velocity of the planet around the planet - moon barycentre must be in the @xmath38-direction when it is at position ( 1 ) . at position ( 1 ) , the transit impact parameter has increased and thus the transit duration has shortened . at the same time , the planet s wobble velocity is additive to the planet - moon barycentre velocity around the host star , and so the transit duration is further shortened .",
    "thus for prograde orbits , it can be seen that the tip- and v - components are additive .",
    "the opposite is true for retrograde orbits .      in appendix c",
    ", we evaluate the total tdv effect in the case of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we are able to show that the r.m.s .",
    "amplitude of the tdv signal is given by :    @xmath41 \\cdot \\frac{\\bar{\\tau}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 is the semi - major axis of the planet s orbit around the planet - moon barycentre , @xmath43 is the semi - major axis of the planet - moon barycentre s orbit around the host star , @xmath6 is the orbital inclination angle of the planet - moon barycentre , @xmath44 is the projected velocity of the planet - moon barycentre across the face of the star during transit , @xmath45 is the orbital period of the satellite and @xmath46 is transit duration of the planet in the absence of a moon .",
    "the positive sign refers to prograde moon orbits and the negative signs refers to retrograde orbits .",
    "it can be seen that the tdv effect has two dominant terms .",
    "the first term is the tip - component is @xmath47 , which is the same as ttv s proportionality ( where @xmath48 is the mass of the satellite ) .",
    "the second term is the v - component and is @xmath49 , as found in our previous paper .",
    "a summary of the properties of the three known transit timing effects due to an exomoon can be seen in table 1 .",
    "._summary of key properties of the three known transit timing effects due to an exomoon . _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : nonlin ]",
    "by considering orbital inclination and the transit impact parameter , we have demonstrated that an additional tdv effect exists , which we have labelled as the tip - component .",
    "it may be tempting to assume that inclined orbits therefore improve the tdv effect due to an exomoon ( assuming a prograde orbit ) and perhaps the best exoplanets candidates for detection purposes would be near - grazing transits .",
    "however , we counter that naive supposition by pointing out that the transit duration itself decreases with higher impact parameters and it can be seen in equation ( 4 ) that both the v- and tip - components have dependancies on @xmath50 .    we may rightly ask whether there is a certain value of impact parameter which enhances the tdv signal optimally . by differentiating equation ( 4 ) with respect to @xmath8 and making some approximations ,",
    "we find that the optimal value of @xmath8 occurs for @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the ratio - of - radii . in other words ,",
    "the tdv signal is enhanced for partial transits where the impact parameter is so high the lightcurve takes a v - shape .    in figure 2 , we plot the variation of the tdv effect for a prograde @xmath53 exomoon around a hypothetical planet .",
    "we use the same hypothetical planet as in our previous , k09 , i.e. an identical system to gj436b except the orbital period is 35.7 days and the eccentricity is zero . as seen in figure 2 , the tdv effect slowly drops off for increasing @xmath8 until we reach the partial - transit regime where the tdv effect becomes extremely large due to the tip - component dominating .",
    "however , the probability of detecting a transit which is only partially transiting is very small due to two reasons : 1 ) geometrically the inclination range is very small 2 ) v - shaped lightcurves are usually rejected as a planetary candidate and labelled as a grazing eclipsing binary . for these reasons , we consider the optimal planets for detecting an exomoon to have the longest transit duration possible , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "is more likely to be the optimal condition.__,width=8 ]      what are the consequences for determing both @xmath55 and @xmath48 separately , as proposed in our last paper ? certainly taking the simple ratio of the tdv and ttv effect will not provide precisely the same equation as we predicted before . from @xcite , the ttv r.m.s .",
    "amplitude , for a circular moon orbit , is given by :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 accounts for the planet s orbital eccentricity .",
    "taking the ratio of tdv to ttv , we have :    @xmath58    the tip - component makes @xmath4 change from simply being inversely proportional to @xmath45 to being inversely proportional to @xmath45 plus a constant .",
    "we highlight the following key points about this equation :    * the ` constant ' is not a function of the moon s properties whatsoever , i.e. it depends on the planetary properties only .",
    "* in the case of @xmath59 , the ` constant ' @xmath60 , retrieving the original equation for @xmath4 , as derived in k09 .",
    "* the ` constant ' may be calculated independently of the moon s properties in a reliable way and thus @xmath45 may still be calculated , providing we assume @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .    equation ( 6 ) tells us that it is still possible to evaluate @xmath45 by simply taking the ratio of the tdv and ttv effects , provided we make certain assumptions about the moon s orbit .",
    "the ` constant ' term quoted above is not a function of the moon s properties , but in reality it is actually a very weak function since we have made the assumption @xmath65 , which is certainly a very valid assumption to make .    although a large tip - component can enhance the detectable signature of an exomoon , if the tip - component is greatly larger than the v - component , then our ability to accurately estimate @xmath45 and hence @xmath48 will diminish .",
    "ideally , the v - component should remain the dominant term for accurate determination of these parameters .    for a system of interest like gj436b ,",
    "the constant is @xmath66 suggesting that ttv is an order of magnitude stronger than the tip - component of the tdv effect .",
    "although this is small , the key point is that it is additive and can be larger than the v - component in certain special cases , notably grazing transits .",
    "we conclude that our previous statement that the ratio of tdv and ttv can be used to determine the moon s orbital distance and mass still remains true , provided we assume a circular co - aligned exomoon orbit . for systems with exomoon eccentricity and inclinations , there will be insufficient information through timing alone to solve for all of these parameters .",
    "observations of transit timing may also permit the determination of whether an exomoon is in a prograde or retrograde orbit , given sufficient signal - to - noise .",
    "we will illustrate this possibility by referring to a hypothetical example of an exomoon detection .",
    "we use the same example as in our last paper , k09 , where we considered shifting gj436b to an circular orbit of 35.7 days period and add a @xmath53 exomoon on a @xmath67 day orbit .",
    "we use the same impact parameter as measured for gj436b by @xcite , i.e. @xmath68 .",
    "consider we measure the ttv r.m.s .",
    "amplitude of this planet to be @xmath69 seconds and the total r.m.s .",
    "tdv amplitude would be @xmath70 seconds giving @xmath71 .",
    "note that we have assumed the duration is measured to half the precision of the mid - transit time and assumed timing errors in - line with the capabilities of forthcoming missions . based on the known inclination and planetary properties , we are able to evaluate the @xmath4 ` constant ' term to be @xmath72 to a negligible error ( since this can be refined by compositing multiple transits ) . therefore the ` info ' component of @xmath4",
    "is either @xmath73 , if prograde , or @xmath74 , if retrograde .",
    "this corresponds to an exomoon period of either @xmath75 days or @xmath76 days for prograde and retrograde respectively , differing by 3-sigmas . with the ttv measured to a signal - to - noise of over 350",
    ", it would not be difficult to use multiple ttv measurements to identify which of these periods is permitted by the frequency of the data points , which in this case is the prograde orbit .",
    "it is important to remember that this calculation was done for a planet - moon orbital plane which is coaligned to the star - planet orbital plane .",
    "slight moon inclinations of @xmath77 would not change the result significantly but very large inclinations would severely disrupt this calculation s accuracy .",
    "we propound that exomoons of low inclination angles would be identifiable by a planet - moon eclipse which should be observable in the lightcurve , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "we therefore propose that it should be possible for future observations to not only detect an exomoon and determine its mass , but also provide a confident deduction of the sense of orbital motion .",
    "although this determination will likely require photometry at the limit of planned missions , it seems likely that once an exomoon is detected a more in - depth investigation would be able to answer the question of orbital sense of motion conclusively .",
    "we have shown that an exomoon around a transiting exoplanet should induce a transit duration variation effect with two dominant components .",
    "one of these components is due to the moon altering the velocity of the host planet , which we label as the v - component .",
    "the second constituent is due to the impact parameter of the transiting planet varying as a result of the moon s presence , which we label as the tip - component .    in table 2 , we have evaluated the v- and tip- components for a list of targets as in our previous paper .",
    "the table suggests that the tip - component is often an order of magnitude less than the v - component , but can therefore we several seconds for some targets .",
    "we do not anticipate this additional component to be a hurdle in determining the moon s mass and orbital distance since the dominant effect on the @xmath4 parameter is to introduce an additive constant , which is independent of the moon s properties .",
    "the tdv effect can be markedly increased for prograde moons which improves their detectability . for grazing transits with highly inclined moons , the planet could even go through epochs where it no longer transits at all , although we do not expect this to be a typical situation .",
    "furthermore , we predict that including the tip - component may allow for the determination of the orbital sense of motion of an exomoon around an exoplanet .",
    "we do however stress that such a determination would require very precise , but feasible , photometry .",
    "we believe this paper further demonstrates the feasibility of detecting an exomoon , but outlines the great care and understanding required to complete the analysis .",

    "the two effects will later be combined in appendix b. the total tdv effect will then be evaluated in the case of a circular , coaligned moon in appendix c. the error regarding one of our key assumptions will be calculated in appendix d.      from figure 1 , it is clear that the change we care about , @xmath22 is in the @xmath32-direction . in order to create a generally oriented orbital plane ,",
    "we do so in several steps . in our first step , we consider the planet - moon centre of mass frame and employ the same geometric model as that of our previous paper where we consider an elliptical orbit with a centre at the origin of an @xmath78-@xmath79-@xmath80 co - ordinate system , the @xmath81 frame .",
    "we may write the position of the planet , as a function of its true anomaly within this frame ( @xmath16 ) , as :    @xmath82    where @xmath83    in the same manner described by @xcite , we then transform these positional coordinates with i ) a counter - clockwise rotation about @xmath80-axis by the position of pericentre angle , @xmath84 ( the @xmath85 frame ) ii ) a translation of the planet - moon barycentre to the origin ( the @xmath86 frame ) .",
    "these two transformations give us :    @xmath87    it is worth noting that in the case of @xmath88 , which we would anticipate to be the typical scenario , we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 .    in this system , we allow the orbital arrangement of the moon to be rotated by the three euler angles , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath3 with respect to the star - planet plane . we choose to employ the conventional @xmath13-@xmath91-@xmath92 convention for the euler system .",
    "the euler rotation angles are ideal because any general rotation in three dimensions can always be written in terms of these three angles .",
    "we denote the @xmath93 position of the planet away from the planet - moon barycentre origin by the vector @xmath94 , then after the euler rotations we have a new positional vector given by :    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the euler rotation matrix .",
    "since @xmath97 , we may write :    @xmath98 \\cdot x_2 ' + [ -c_{\\alpha } s_{\\gamma } - s_{\\alpha } c_{\\beta } c_{\\gamma } ] \\cdot y_2 ' \\nonumber \\\\ y_3 ' & = [ s_{\\alpha } c_{\\gamma } + c_{\\alpha } c_{\\beta } s_{\\gamma } ] \\cdot x_2 ' + [ -s_{\\alpha } s_{\\gamma } + c_{\\alpha } c_{\\beta } c_{\\gamma } ] \\cdot y_2 ' \\nonumber \\\\",
    "z_3 ' & = s_\\beta s_\\gamma \\cdot x_2 ' + s_\\beta c_\\gamma \\cdot y_2'\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        we have therefore found the position of the planet away from the planet - moon barycentre as a function of @xmath16 .      consider the orbit of a point mass around the host star .",
    "we denote this point mass by the coordinates @xmath99 ( the @xmath100 frame ) . placing the origin at the centre of the ellipse , we can write :    @xmath101    we then rotate for position of pericentre and translate so that the star is at the origin .",
    "@xmath102    for the moment we will not include the orbital inclination angle , but return to it later .",
    "earlier on we defined the position of the planet , in relation to the planet - moon barycentre as @xmath103 .",
    "so the true position of the planet is the vector for the barycentre s position , @xmath104 added to the vector for the relative position of the planet , with respect to the barycentre , @xmath105 .",
    "this gives us @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath107    finally , we now rotate about the @xmath108-axis in a counter - clockwise sense by an angle @xmath109 , in order to be consistent with our defined system shown in figure 1 .",
    "note that in our previous paper we performed this rotation in the clockwise direction and we choose to do the opposite direction here for mathematical simplicity .",
    "of course , the choice of direction does not affect the final result .",
    "@xmath110      although the euler angles can play a significant role in enhancing the tdv effects , we predict that most exomoons will not exhibit significant inclination deviations from the planet - star plane and so we decide to set all of these angles to zero .",
    "this is also valid because it would be impossible to determine all of the euler angles from just two measurements in any case .",
    "thus we have :    @xmath111 \\sin i \\nonumber \\\\ z & = [ \\tilde{y_2 } + y_2 ' ] \\cos i\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for an observer at infinite @xmath112 , the @xmath113-component is never seen .",

    "we also assume @xmath117 , but @xmath118 .",
    "ergo , this is not the same case considered in our previous research where @xmath0 . although we could write the down the expressions for the most general case , to do seems pointless given that there will not be enough information to solve for all of these parameters in any case . for the stated assumptions :    @xmath119    _ where the @xmath120 symbol refers to prograde / retrograde exomoon orbits",
    "respectively _",
    "although in reality the magnitude of the vector connecting the planet to the star s centre is no longer @xmath43 , the maximum by which it can be modified will be given by @xmath42 . since @xmath65",
    ", we will assume that this changing magnitude vector does not significantly affect the tdv amplitude relative to the change in @xmath10 .    as a result of changing @xmath10",
    ", the observed transit impact parameter appears to change . without a moon present ,",
    "the impact parameter should be simply given by :    @xmath121    but now the altered effective impact parameter will be given by :    @xmath122    we now consider that the tdv signal due to the tip effect is given by the observed duration ( @xmath123 ) minus the expected duration :    @xmath124      @xcite proposed that the velocity of a planet during a transit is modified by the presence of an exomoon .",
    "we label this tdv effect as the v - component .",
    "this effect is in addition to the previously detailed tip - component .",
    "we will now derive the modification to the v - component in the presence of orbital inclinations . in our previous paper",
    ", we defined :    @xmath125    in our orbital setup , we assume the planet is moving in the positive @xmath91-direction . therefore , we need to know what component of @xmath126 remains in this direction given a rotation through the three euler angles . taking the original vector @xmath127 and rotating we find that the @xmath91-component is modified to :    @xmath128 v_{w\\bot } \\nonumber \\\\ v_{w\\bot } & \\rightarrow \\varphi(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma ) \\cdot v_{w\\bot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this modifies our velocity tdv component to :    @xmath129    but note that this does not include the tip - component .",
    "now that we have written down the tdv signal for both the v- and tip - components independently , the next step is to combine the two .",
    "we now consider the total effect .",
    "the v - component is just a factor which modifies the duration , so this can be applied after the tip - component . by employing this ordering , we are able to write the transit duration , in the the general case , as :    @xmath130    it would useful at this point to have @xmath131 written as some factor multiplied by the mean transit duration @xmath46 , where it is understood that @xmath132 . let :    @xmath133    we note that @xmath123 gets larger as @xmath8 approaches zero .",

    "thus , @xmath134 for @xmath31 and vice versa .",
    "our tdv may now be written as :    @xmath135    appreciating that @xmath136 , this expression may be approximated to :    @xmath137 \\cdot \\bar{\\tau}\\ ] ]    we can now see that the tdv signal has two clear components . in the absence of any tip - component , @xmath138 and hence we recover the original tdv effect predicted in our previous paper . since @xmath139 is a value close to unity , we choose to write it as :    @xmath140    where it is understood that @xmath141 is small compared to unity .",
    "this now gives us :    @xmath142 \\cdot \\bar{\\tau } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\textrm{tdv}(f_w ) & \\simeq \\big[\\varrho(f_w ) - \\frac{v_{w\\bot}(f_w)}{v_{b\\bot}}\\big ] \\cdot \\bar{\\tau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    consider the case of @xmath31 , as mentioned earlier this means @xmath143 and so the first term is positive .",
    "@xmath22 is positive when @xmath144 goes negative for prograde orbits .",
    "so the second term must be negative too , and thus we have a double negative which equals a positive",
    ". thus we confirm that when for prograde orbits the tdv effect is additive .",
    "it is also clear that the total effect is dominated by two terms which are linearly additive .",
    "these means the tip - component can significantly increase tdv signals due to prograde exomoons . on the other hand , it can significantly dampen any effect for retrograde moons .",
    "infact , if the tip - component is very large for a retrograde , it may change the sign of the effect completely meaning that instead of tdv lagging behind ttv by @xmath5 , the opposite is true .",
    "in order to ascertain the proportionality and magnitude of the total tdv effect , let us first assume the transit duration is given by the circular equations described by @xcite . using equation ( 16 ) from this paper and replacing @xmath147 with @xmath10 :    @xmath148    which gives us :    @xmath149    even if we use the equations for the approximate transit duration due to an eccentric orbit as presented by @xcite by their equation ( 1 ) , the same value of @xmath150 is derived .",
    "thus the following derivation holds true for planets on eccentric orbits . expanding out the brackets we have :    @xmath151    assuming @xmath152 is small and @xmath65 ,",
    "we may write :    @xmath153    unfortunately , evaluating the integral of @xmath154 is non - trivial , even with these approximations . without a direct computation of this integral",
    ", we can not evaluate the r.m.s .",
    "amplitude directly . in order to estimate the r.m.s .",
    "amplitude , we assume the signal takes a sinusoidal form and thus the r.m.s",
    ". amplitude will be given by the normal amplitude divided by @xmath155 .",
    "this approximation is particularly valid because we have assumed @xmath61 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath139 and @xmath156 is for @xmath157 .",
    "we also take advantage of the fact we know @xmath139 is close to unity and therefore we approximate the square root to find @xmath158 .",
    "@xmath159    this gives us a max signal of :    @xmath160 \\cdot \\bar{\\tau}\\ ] ]    or an r.m.s .",
    "signal of :    @xmath161 \\cdot \\frac{\\bar{\\tau}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ ] ]",
    "throughout we have assumed that @xmath156 does not change significantly over the course of the transit .",
    "this essentially the same as assuming that @xmath162 . for a normal circular orbit",
    ", the planetary transit would occur for @xmath15 changing by a quantity :                  in contrast , previously we assume a fixed constant velocity of @xmath169 .",
    "so it seems we very slightly overestimate the average velocity during the transit , as expected .",
    "the dominant error term can be written out by expanding the @xmath170 function :      thus the fractional error in @xmath156 is given by @xmath172 .",
    "the error should be largest for close - in orbits and even for a 3-day hot - jupiter with typical parameters we would expect this error to be less than 1 part in @xmath173 ."
