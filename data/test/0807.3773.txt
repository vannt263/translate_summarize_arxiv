    "observation in 2003 , october and november , with different ebl models from that used here .",
    "according to their results , the source was in a low or quiet state . with their leptonic model",
    ", they obtained @xmath87 cm , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 g ( model 2 ) .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , used the ssc model to fit another quiescent state , but without the correction for @xmath6-ray absorption by ebl .",
    "they obtained @xmath90 cm , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 g. the ratio @xmath93 is 3 , which is smaller by a factor 9 , compared with our results for 2003 july .",
    "the source size obtained by us is the largest among these models for quiescent states .",
    "in this work we have shown that a large value of the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath94 , is required to explain the emission from pks 2155304 in the tev band as well as the x - ray band . with @xmath50 cm and @xmath95 ,",
    "the timescale @xmath96 s is obtained , while @xmath57 s is obtained for @xmath97 cm and @xmath98 - 150 .",
    "the value of @xmath25 as large as 100 requires the viewing angle as small as 0.01 rad , which makes the case an unlikely coincidence if the opening angle of the jet is the same order as @xmath99 .",
    "however , if the opening angle is larger than @xmath99 , we can observe a portion of the jet that aligns with the line of sight , thus avoiding an excessively small observability .",
    "considering that mrk 501 also exhibited a similar short timescale tev flare , we think that the opening angle is larger than @xmath100 ( by a factor @xmath101 ) . if this is the case , @xmath9 represents the lateral size along the jet motion , while the transverse size is larger than @xmath9 by the same factor @xmath101 .",
    "thus the real size of the emission region is larger than @xmath9 and only a part of the emission regions is observed owing to a strong relativistic beaming effect",
    ". then the kinetic power should be by a factor @xmath102 larger than a conventional estimate given by @xmath103 .",
    "a further speculative possibility is that the opening angle is as small as @xmath99 but the jet axis wanders within a large angle and the flare is observed when its direction happens to fall in the line of sight .",
    "our results show that the jet plasma is highly particle energy dominated over magnetic energy , i.e. , @xmath104 in the flare state in 2006 . the ratio @xmath93 has been discussed in many papers . in @xcite",
    "we discussed that tev blazars are generally particle dominated typically by a factor of 10 . for a quiescent state of pks 2155304 we obtained the ratio of 3 .",
    "thus the ratio of @xmath105 seems unusually high , although there is no serious theoretical reason to expect a ratio of unity except that it leads to a minimum kinetic power for a given observed spectrum . the obtained high value of the ratio basically results from the fact that the ssc luminosity is much larger than the synchrotron luminosity . in this respect ,",
    "we note that the x - ray and tev observations are not strictly simultaneous ; if the x - ray flux during the tev flare is higher than the adopted value in this paper , the ratio decreases correspondingly .",
    "also , some soft photon sources other than synchrotron radiation will help to decrease the ratio .",
    "however , considering a good fit to the observed spectrum obtained here , such possibilities are not easy to realize and the reduction will not be significant . @xcite and @xcite adopted the view that the tev flare is caused by external compton mechanism . in this case",
    ", the model may avoid an extremely large value of @xmath93 .",
    "however , considering the short timescale of radiative deceleration , the acceleration of the emitting plasma to the large bulk lorentz factor itself becomes very difficult because of the large radiation drag effect .",
    "also note that both papers did not make detailed multi - wavelength fitting .    as mentioned above",
    ", @xcite argued that inverse compton scattering off external soft photons is favored as the dominant radiation process to produce tev @xmath6-rays .",
    "the major differences between their model and ours are that they assumed the dominance of the poynting flux over the kinetic energy flux as well as the synchrotron radiation as a major cooling process to estimate particle s cooling timescale , while in our model the energy flux is dominated by nonthermal particle s kinetic energy and the cooling is dominated by ssc .    in comparison between the flare state in 2006 july and the quiescent state in 2003 july , the powers in radiation and electrons increased by factors 2 and 4.2 , respectively , during the flare in 2006 , if model a is adopted .",
    "the increase in the jet power is significant and the efficient acceleration of electrons is implied .",
    "the size of the blob for the 2006 july flare is @xmath1 cm .",
    "this is about 3 @xmath106 , if the mass of the central black hole is @xmath107 .",
    "a large energy injection into a very compact region occurred in the flare .",
    "the obtained parameter values for the flare event and various phases are not well ordered and we found no simple tendencies from quiescent states to flares .",
    "the tev flare may be caused by a concentration of energy into a sub - horizon scale region , while during quiescent states we may be seeing larger scale energy dissipation on longer timescales .    in applying our model",
    ", we assumed a low flux model of ebl , i.e. , lll of @xcite . with this ebl model the one - zone ssc model",
    "is found to be viable for this tev blazar , although other models proposed by @xcite and @xcite might explain the tev spectrum with higher fluxes of ebl .",
    "this should be studied in future work .",
    "radiation below @xmath47 hz is not fitted with our model .",
    "we assumed that the emission comes from more extended regions far away from the central black hole ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
