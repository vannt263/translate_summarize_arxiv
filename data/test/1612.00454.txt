    "in the last decade , large transient surveys have discovered a number of previously unknown classes of astrophysical transients , expanding the parameter space of known explosions , including several new classes in the former luminosity `` gap '' between supernovae ( sne ) and novae @xcite .",
    "one such new class is the ca - rich gap transients , with the peculiar transient sn2005e as a prototype @xcite .",
    "kasliwal et al .",
    "( 2012 ; hereafter k12 ) proposed the following five properties to define the class : ( 1 ) intermediate luminosity ( `` gap '' transients ) , ( 2 ) faster photometric evolution ( rise and decline ) than normal sne , ( 3 ) photospheric velocities comparable to those of sne , ( 4 ) rapid evolution to the nebular phase , and ( 5 ) a nebular spectrum dominated by calcium emission",
    ". the rapid evolution indicates a class of transients with low ejecta masses ( @xmath2 ) , whereas the nebular spectra suggest an ejecta composition dominated by calcium @xcite .",
    "the sample of ca - rich gap transients is still small . following the discovery of the first such object , sn2005e @xcite , the palomar transient factory @xcite presented three additional objects with similar properties : ptf09dav , ptf10iuv , and ptf11bij ( @xcite ; k12 ) .",
    "sn2012hn , found by crts @xcite and followed up by pessto , has since been added @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are a number of archival candidates noted for their ca - rich nebular spectra @xcite , from which k12 determined that sn2007ke fits the ca - rich gap transient criteria .",
    "the remainder of these archival candidates ( 6 total : sn2000ds , sn2001co , sn2003h , sn2003dg , sn2003dr , and sn2005cz ) are sometimes referred to as `` ca - rich supernovae '' ( in particular , see @xcite , who identified the first four such objects ) , but lack sufficient data to determine whether they constitute the same physical phenomenon as the more strictly defined ca - rich gap transients . in particular , photometry is necessary to establish the low peak luminosity and low ejecta mass , and a high ratio of ca to o in the nebular spectrum can also be seen in peculiar core - collapse and type ia sne depending on the phase of the spectrum , and is in itself not sufficient @xcite . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we only consider the objects that satisfy both the photometric and spectroscopic criteria of k12 , though we sometimes refer to the extended sample as candidates .",
    "the progenitor system of ca - rich gap transients is not known , but their host environments provide strong clues : out of the six confirmed members so far , only ptf09dav has a spiral host galaxy , while the rest have elliptical or s0 host galaxies , implying a predominantly old progenitor population .",
    "even more striking , many are found at substantial offsets from their presumed host galaxies , suggesting either that they originate in extremely faint systems ( such as globular clusters ; @xcite ) , or alternatively that the progenitor has traveled from its birth site .",
    "increasingly deep limits at the transient locations have failed to detect an underlying host system , favoring the latter interpretation @xcite .    while the environments and locations strongly hint at an old progenitor population and thus a binary system progenitor , there are currently several proposed models for what the progenitor system actually is .",
    "@xcite suggested sn2005e may be the result of he detonation from accretion from a he white dwarf onto a co white dwarf , one of several variants of wd - wd progenitors proposed @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the tidal detonation of a he white dwarf by a neutron star or stellar - mass black hole @xcite .",
    "a better understanding of their origin is interesting not only from the point of view of binary evolution , but also from their nontrivial contribution to the ca abundance : @xcite showed that including the contribution from ca - rich gap transients could resolve the discrepancy between the measured ca abundances in galaxy clusters , and the abundances expected from core - collapse and type ia sn yields .",
    "as the sample of ca - rich transients is still small , adding to the number of well - studied objects is necessary . here , we present the discovery of two new members of the class of ca - rich gap transients discovered by the palomar transient factory ( ptf11kmb and ptf12bho ) , as well as analysis of both the transients themselves and their host environments .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present our observations of ptf11kmb and ptf12bho and their host environments in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the transient properties are given in section  [ sec : gap ] , demonstrating that they are members of the class of ca - rich gap transients .",
    "we discuss the host - galaxy properties in section  [ sec : gal ] .",
    "the implications for the origins of ca - rich gap transients and a summary are provided in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "all calculations in this paper assume a @xmath3cdm cosmology with @xmath4  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "ptf11kmb and ptf12bho were found as part of the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; @xcite ) .",
    "ptf11kmb was discovered in data taken with the cfh12k 96-megapixel camera @xcite mounted on the 48-inch samuel oschin telescope at palomar observatory ( p48 ) on 2011 aug .",
    "16.25 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) at j2000 coordinates @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and at a magnitude @xmath10  mag .",

    "no host galaxy is seen underlying the sn position in the reference image .",
    "ptf12bho was discovered in p48 data on 2012 feb .",

    "we obtained @xmath14- and @xmath15-band photometry of ptf11kmb and ptf12bho with the p48 cfh12k camera .",
    "additional follow - up photometry was conducted with the automated 60-inch telescope at palomar ( p60 ; @xcite ) in the @xmath16 bands , and with the las cumbres observatory ( lco ) faulkes telescope north in @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "host - subtracted point - spread function ( psf ) photometry was obtained using the palomar transient factory image differencing and extraction ( ptfide ) pipeline @xcite on the p48 images , and the pipeline presented by @xcite on the p60 images .",
    "lco data were processed using the tools available at github.com/lcogt/banzai , and psf photometry was performed following @xcite .",

    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have shown that ptf11kmb and ptf12bho are members of the class of ca - rich gap transients as described by k12 , having low peak luminosities , rapid evolution , and a rapid transition to the nebular phase with a nebular spectrum dominated by ca features .",
    "the addition of these two objects brings the number of confirmed members ( with well - sampled photometric and spectroscopic information ) to eight .",
    "ptf11kmb and ptf12bho are also the ca - rich gap transients found at the largest offsets from their presumed host galaxies to date , and are perhaps better described as intra - group and intra - cluster transients ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "taken together , the host environments of the ca - rich gap transients are striking .",
    "the fact that any are found in early - type galaxies indicates that the progenitors are likely old .",
    "we note , however , that the observed fraction of early - type galaxies ( 7/8 ) is much higher than what is seen for sne  ia and sgrbs , whose host populations include @xmath20 late - time galaxies , indicating that their rates depend on both the star - formation rate and stellar mass @xcite . moreover , if the rate of ca - rich gap transients depended only on stellar mass , we would expect their host - galaxy demographics to follow the distribution of stellar mass in the local universe , and thus find about equal numbers of late - type and early - type hosts @xcite .",
    "the fact that the overwhelming majority of hosts are early - type therefore points to other factors being important for the progenitor population .",
    "given the preference for early - type galaxies , as well as for group and cluster environments , a leading candidate for the dominant factor is stellar population age . in general , massive halos like the ones that host clusters and massive groups formed the majority of their stars before @xmath21 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and thus are dominated by stellar populations older than @xmath22 .",
    "if this is the driving factor for the host - galaxy preference , it implies that the progenitor systems for ca - rich gap transients have a very long merging time ( or more generally , a delay - time distribution that peaks at long timescales ) .",
    "these massive environments are also where the greatest proportion of stars are found in the intra - cluster light ( icl ) , which may at least partially explain the remote environments @xcite .",
    "if age is indeed the driving factor , however , we would expect to also find a fraction _ within _ elliptical or s0 galaxies .",
    "we note that there are at least two such examples among the candidate ca - rich gap transients : sn2005cz in the elliptical galaxy ngc4589 , and sn2000ds in ngc2768 @xcite .",
    "our search of the ptf database demonstrates that the relative lack of ca - rich gap transients at small offsets found in ptf is not likely to be caused by a selection effect , and rather illustrates the importance of wide - field , galaxy - untargeted surveys in detecting such remote transients .",
    "one proposed explanation for the offset distribution has been that ca - rich gap transients originate in very faint systems such as globular clusters , in which case a preference toward group and cluster environments is also predicted @xcite .",
    "however , the deep photometric limits at the locations of ca - rich gap transients , including those presented in this paper for sn2005e and ptf12bho , rule out an underlying dwarf galaxy as well as most of the globular cluster luminosity function . while our _ hst _ imaging does not rule out a globular cluster origin for ptf11kmb , it is unlikely to be a dominant channel for producing ca - rich gap transients , at least assuming they are not kicked out of the globular cluster before merging .",
    "the general lack of underlying / faint host systems is consistent with previous findings @xcite , and has been used to argue that ca - rich gap transients do not form `` in situ '' at these remote locations , but have traveled to their explosion sites .",
    "one attractive property of the ns - wd merger scenario @xcite is that the binary would have received a kick in the sn explosion that creates the neutron star ; such sn kicks are indeed also evoked to explain the offset distribution of sgrbs , which is consistent with theoretical predictions for ns - ns mergers @xcite . in this context",
    ", it is interesting to note that the offset distribution for ca - rich gap transients is significantly more extreme than that of sgrbs ( section  [ sec : offsets ] ; figure  [ fig : offsets ] ) .",
    "in addition , stellar population synthesis models predict lower median velocities for wd - ns systems than for ns - ns systems @xcite . thus",
    ", if the origin of the large offsets is sn kicks , the merger times for ca - rich gap transients must be significantly longer than for sgrbs .",
    "the offset - based argument only holds if we assume that the ca - rich gap transients originate from the galaxies and thus need to travel a significant distance before they explode .",
    "we note , however , that if the progenitor systems are formed in globular clusters , an sn kick could easily eject the system , since the escape velocities of globular clusters are only of order tens of km  s@xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if the progenitors are ns - wd binaries , the lack of underlying host systems does not necessarily rule out a contribution from systems originating in globular clusters .",
    "in fact , simulations of globular clusters show that in order to match the rate of observed low - mass x - ray binaries , they must assume that a fraction of neutron stars form in electron - capture sne since most of the neutron star systems forming in core - collapse sne end up being ejected from the cluster @xcite .",
    "a caveat is that only binaries formed on timescales shorter than the time to the sn creating the neutron star would be ejected this way .",
    "for binaries formed dynamically after the neutron star is created , one would still expect them to explode within the globular cluster .    if the progenitor system is not a ns - wd binary but rather a wd - wd binary ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", the remote locations require a different origin than sn kicks .",
    "one possibility , as noted above , is that group and cluster environments have a large fraction of stars in icl , resulting from galaxy - galaxy stripping and galaxy mergers in the formation of the cluster .",
    "the case for a globular cluster origin , on the other hand , is weaker without being able to invoke sn kicks , but in principle a wd - wd binary could be ejected from a globular cluster through dynamical interactions .",
    "a third possibility was proposed by @xcite , who suggested that ca - rich gap transients originate in nuclear regions of their host galaxies and are flung out at high velocities following an interaction with the central supermassive black hole . at the very least , any progenitor model will have to be able to explain not just the properties of the ca - rich transients themselves but also their strong environment preferences .",
    "finally , we note that the ca - rich gap transients constitute one emerging subclass amongst a number of peculiar transients that have been discovered over the past decade and that are some combination of faint , fast , hydrogen - poor , or found in old environments and at large offsets ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while the properties described by k12 were modeled on sn2005e and attempted to define the maximum set of characteristics that give the largest number of related transients , they were still empirically defined , so it is possible that they do not all constitute the same physical phenomenon .",
    "notably , k12 allowed for diversity in the photospheric - phase spectra and did not require the detection of he , without which ptf09dav would not have been considered a member of this class .",
    "the fact that ptf09dav seems to be an outlier both in terms of its sn and host - galaxy properties suggests that it may have a distinct physical origin from the rest of the objects in the sample . while sample sizes are currently small , upcoming surveys like the zwicky transient facility and the large synoptic survey telescope should continue to discover more of these rare transients , shedding light on their true origins .",

    "first , the spectrum shows emerging [ ] emission , which is not present in normal sne  ib at such an early phase ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but was also seen in sn2005e .",
    "second , while the light curve ( shown in figure  [ fig:10hcw_lc ] ) for this object is extremely sparse since it was discovered as the field was going into solar conjunction , the brightest observed @xmath44-band magnitude was @xmath45 .",
    "this was at a phase 15  days after discovery ( and 21  days after the last nondetection ) , so it is likely that the sn was near peak light , and by extension that the peak brightness was fainter than that of a typical sn  ib .",
    "this is , in itself , not enough to classify ptf10hcw as a ca - rich gap transient as opposed to a peculiar type ib sn , as we lack both a well - sampled light curve and a nebular - phase spectrum ; we merely present it here as a candidate .",
    "we note that ptf10hcw was found at a projected offset 25.7(5.9  kpc ) from the nucleus of ngc2639 , which is classified as an sa galaxy with liner nuclear activity in ned . the host galaxy and sn location",

    "<S> a striking feature of both transients is their host environments : ptf12bho is an intra - cluster transient in the coma cluster , while ptf11kmb is located in a loose galaxy group , at a physical offset @xmath0  kpc from the most likely host galaxy . </S>",

    "<S> we also show that almost all ca - rich gap transients found to date are in group and cluster environments with elliptical host galaxies , indicating a very old progenitor population ; the remote locations could partially be explained by these environments having the largest fraction of stars in the intra - group / intra - cluster light following galaxy - galaxy interactions . </S>"
