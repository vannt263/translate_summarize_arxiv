    "suspensions of particles with attraction exhibit equilibrium states as well as non - equilibrium states like gels or glasses that evolve very slowly @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations were found to be useful for the understanding of the structure and the dynamics of such systems @xcite .",
    "the advantage of simulations is that large scale phenomena may be related to the microscopic trajectories of the particles . in recent years",
    "computer simulations have yielded valuable insight not only into equilibrium properties such as cluster size distributions and structure factors , but also into the evolution of the system during phase separation @xcite and gelation @xcite .",
    "often monte carlo methods are used to study structural properties at equilibrium and molecular dynamics to study dynamics and kinetics @xcite .",
    "monte - carlo methods allow one to study relatively large systems and generally require less computer time to obtain equilibrium states .",
    "a main draw back of classical monte carlo methods is that the definition of time is usually unphysical so that the evolution of the system towards equilibrium can not be compared to that of real systems .",
    "molecular dynamics simulate the particle displacement more realistically , but the system size and time scales that can be simulated with the current generation of computers are still relatively small .    the simplest model of interacting fluids is an ensemble of hard spheres that interact through a square well potential .",
    "here we compare two different methods to simulate this model system : brownian cluster dynamics ( bcd ) and event driven brownian dynamics ( edbd ) @xcite . with bcd clusters",
    "are constructed by forming bonds between spheres within each others interaction range with a given probability . with this method",
    "it is possible to account for hydrodynamic interaction within the clusters , though not between the clusters .",
    "it is also possible to study the influence of bond rigidity on the dynamics .",
    "this is important because in real systems bonds may be more or less rigid . with edbd hydrodynamic interaction is ignored and the bonds are inherently completely flexible .",
    "we will show here that for reversibly aggregating systems bond rigidity has no influence on the structure of the steady state , but has a huge effect on the dynamics .    in the following",
    "we will first describe the two simulation methods .",
    "then we compare the structure factors and the cluster size distributions of homogenous equilibrium states .",
    "we will show that almost the same structures are obtained at steady state with both methods . the main part of paper deals with the self diffusion coefficient as a function of the interaction strength .",
    "we compare the results obtained by the two simulation methods and discuss the influence of bond flexibility and intra - cluster hydrodynamic interaction .",
    "we simulate hard spheres interacting through a square well potential characterized by a well depth @xmath1 and a well width @xmath2 using bcd and edbd .",
    "both simulation methods start with an ensemble of @xmath3 randomly distributed spheres with diameter equal to unity in a box of size @xmath4 so that the volume fraction is defined as @xmath5 .",
    "* event driven brownian dynamics*. this method was described in detail in the literature @xcite and we only resume here the principal features . initially a random velocity is assigned to each sphere from a gaussian distribution with average squared velocity @xmath6 and variance @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath9 is the absolute temperature and @xmath10 is the mass of the particle .",
    "events are defined as occurrences when the sphere is at a distance unity or @xmath11 from another sphere , i.e. when spheres touch , or cross the interaction range .",
    "first the shortest time , @xmath12 , before an event occurs is calculated .",
    "then all spheres are moved over a distance @xmath13 , where @xmath12 can not exceed a certain maximum value .",
    "it is important that the maximum value of @xmath12 is sufficiently small so that the motion is brownian over the relevant length scales , i.e. the interaction range and the average distance between the nearest neighbors .    after each sphere",
    "has been displaced the velocity of the spheres involved in the event are changed while conserving the energy and the momentum . when the event is a collision the spheres will bounce elastically in opposite directions . when the sphere enters a well its velocity is decreased because the potential energy is increased . when the sphere tries to leave a well it either bounces back elastically or it exits with a higher velocity .",
    "the change in the velocity and the probability to exit the well depend on @xmath1 .",
    "the mean squared displacement of a single sphere is given by : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of simulation steps and @xmath12 is equal to the maximum time step .",
    "if time is defined as @xmath16 then the free diffusion coefficient of a single sphere is equal to : @xmath17 . in this paper",
    "the unit of energy is the thermal energy .",
    "we note that in the literature often @xmath1 is fixed at unity and @xmath9 is varied .    *",
    "brownian cluster dynamics .",
    "* spheres are considered to be in contact when they are within each others interaction range , i.e. when the center to center distance is smaller than @xmath11 . in the so - called cluster formation step ,",
    "spheres in contact are bound with probability @xmath18 .",
    "alternatively , bonds are formed with probability @xmath19 and broken with probability @xmath20 , so that the @xmath21 . in the latter case",
    "one can vary the kinetics of the aggregation from diffusion limited ( @xmath22 ) to reaction limited ( @xmath23 ) with the same @xmath18 and thus the same degree of reversibility .",
    "clusters are defined as collections of bound spheres and monomers are clusters of size one .",
    "after this procedure @xmath24 clusters are formed .",
    "we mention that more complex interaction potentials can be simulated by making @xmath18 a function of the distance between two spheres .",
    "the ratio of the number of bound ( @xmath25 ) to free contacts ( @xmath26-@xmath25 ) is given by the boltzmann distribution : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the enthalpy difference between bound and free contacts .",
    "the formation of @xmath25 randomly distributed bonds over @xmath26 contacts leads to a decrease of the free energy equal to @xmath1 per contact .",
    "this decrease may be written as the sum of the decrease of the enthalpy and the gain of the entropy : @xmath29 .",
    "the latter is determined by the number of ways @xmath25 bonds can distributed over @xmath26 contacts : @xmath30)$ ] .",
    "noticing that p=@xmath31 , we can express @xmath18 in terms of @xmath1 : @xmath32    the cluster construction step is followed by one of three different movement steps that each simulates a different type of cluster dynamics .",
    "* bcd1*. @xmath3 times a sphere is randomly selected and an attempt is made to move it a distance @xmath33 in a random direction .",
    "the movement is accepted if it does not lead to overlap with any other sphere in the system and if it does not lead to the separation of bound spheres beyond the interaction range .",
    "again it is important to choose the step size @xmath33 sufficiently small so that the motion is brownian over the relevant length scales .",
    "we have found that the results on the equilibrium structure were independent of the step size if @xmath33 was at least five times smaller than the interaction range and at least three times smaller than the average distance between nearest neighbors @xcite .",
    "the mean squared displacement of a single sphere is given by : @xmath34 where @xmath15 is again the number of simulation steps .",
    "time was defined as @xmath35 , so that the free diffusion coefficient of single spheres is equal to : @xmath36 .",
    "* bcd2 * @xmath37 times a cluster is randomly selected .",
    "an attempt is made to move the whole cluster over a distance @xmath38 in a random direction with @xmath39 the diameter of the cluster . by definition",
    "this cooperative movement never leads to bond breaking .",
    "the movement is refused if it leads to overlap of any of the spheres in the clusters with other spheres in the system .",
    "the free diffusion coefficient of single spheres is thus still @xmath40 , but the free diffusion coefficient of clusters is @xmath41 .    *",
    "bcd3 * this movement step is a combination of the previous two .",
    "first the movement step bcd1 is executed and the displacement of the centers of mass of each cluster is calculated .",
    "then each cluster is given an additional displacement in the same direction so that the total displacement of the center of mass is the same as would be obtained by the movement step of bcd2 .",
    "again displacements are refused if they lead to overlap . as for movement step bcd2 ,",
    "the free diffusion coefficient of single spheres is @xmath40 , and that of larger clusters is @xmath41",
    ". a lower degree of flexibility can be simulated by performing movement step bcd1 with a lower frequency than movement step bcd2 .",
    "the methods edbd , bcd1 and bcd3 simulate systems with flexible bonds , while bcd2 simulates systems with rigid bonds . using edbd and bcd1",
    "the effective friction coefficient of clusters is proportional to their aggregation number ( so - called rouse dynamics)@xcite , while for bcd2 and bcd3 it is proportional to their radius ( so - called zimm dynamics)@xcite .",
    "it is , of course , straightforward to modify bcd2 to simulate systems with rigid bonds in which the friction coefficient is proportional to their aggregation number .",
    "this has not been done here , because in reality hydrodynamic interaction causes the free diffusion coefficient of clusters in solution to be inversely proportional to their radius @xcite .",
    "the movement steps of edbd and bcd1 are similar and one expects that diffusion coefficients obtained by these methods are close .",
    "bcd may be considered a monte carlo type simulation , but if one is interested only in the structural properties at equilibrium it is more efficient to use other monte - carlo techniques that do not yield realistic kinetics or dynamics .",
    "bcd does not fulfill the condition of detailed balance , but does lead to a steady state independent of the starting configuration , which shows that it fulfills the condition of balance @xcite .",
    "the same steady state is reached for each of the three movement steps with one exception : bcd2 does not lead to crystallization .",
    "the reason is that the pathway to form crystals is extremely unlikely when the bonds are rigid .",
    "bcd2 is therefore an excellent method to explore to properties of attractive spheres while avoiding crystallization @xcite .",
    "the strength of the attraction is determined by the well width and the well depth .",
    "however , the equilibrium structure obtained at different @xmath2 is close if @xmath1 is chosen such that the second virial coefficient is the same , especially if @xmath2 is small@xcite .",
    "@xmath42 may be written as the sum of a repulsive ( excluded volume ) part and an attractive part : @xmath43 , with @xmath44 where the unit of @xmath42 is the volume of a sphere .    as mentioned in the introduction strong attraction between the spheres",
    "leads to phase separation , while weak attraction leads to a homogeneous equilibrium state containing a distribution of transient clusters .",
    "we have characterized these states in terms of the static structure factor ( @xmath45 ) and the cluster size distribution .",
    "the structure factor at @xmath46 is inversely proportional to the compressibility and can be expressed in terms of a virial expansion at small volume fractions : @xmath47 .",
    "for hard spheres interacting with a square well potential the second and third virial coefficients have been calculated analytically @xcite .",
    "figure([f.3 ] ) shows a comparison of @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 obtained from bcd simulations with the values calculated using the virial expansion .",
    "there is good agreement up to @xmath50 beyond which higher order virial terms become important .",
    "figure([f.1 ] ) compares @xmath45 obtained with bcd and edbd at several conditions . within",
    "the uncertainty range the same structures were observed with the two methods .",
    "the cluster size distribution represents a more precise characterization .",
    "clusters of bound spheres can be formed by connecting spheres in contact with probability @xmath51 as defined above .",
    "a detailed analysis of these cluster size distributions has been reported elsewhere . here",
    ", we have analysed the size distribution of clusters formed by connecting all contacts in order to facilitate comparison between bcd and edbd .",
    "figure([f.2 ] ) shows a comparison of @xmath52 i.e. the average density of clusters consisting of m spheres at @xmath53 and @xmath54 for two values of @xmath42 : 2 and 0 .",
    "the width of the distribution increases with increasing @xmath1 until at a critical value a system spanning transient network of spheres in contact is formed . there is a very small , but systematic difference between the cluster size distributions obtained with bcd and edbd .",
    "slightly larger clusters are formed with bcd .",
    "nevertheless , we may conclude from these examples and similar comparisons at other conditions that the equilibrium structures obtained by bcd and edbd are almost the same .",
    "it can be shown that random displacement with constant step size as done with bcd leads to brownian diffusion at distances much larger than the step size @xcite . for a proper comparison of the dynamic properties of bcd and edbd simulations",
    "one has to ensure that the time scales and the free diffusion coefficients are the same , which can be done by choosing @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "figure([f.4 ] ) shows a comparison of the average mean square displacement of hard spheres obtained from bcd and edbd at @xmath49=0.3 . in both simulations @xmath57r2@xmath58",
    "becomes proportional to t and the diffusion coefficient can be calculated as @xmath59 .",
    "figure([f.5 ] ) shows that the same @xmath49 dependence of @xmath0 is obtained by the two methods within the uncertainty of the simulations .",
    "@xmath0 decreases with increasing volume fraction due to steric hindrance and the diffusion slows down critically at the so - called glass transition , which has been the subject of intensive investigation @xcite .    when we introduce attraction between the spheres we need to consider cooperative cluster motion and bond flexibility .",
    "edbd allows only one type of motion , but using bcd one can choose between different movement steps .",
    "we have simulated the mean square displacement of spheres using edbd and bcd with the three different movement steps described above . in each case",
    "diffusive motion was observed for large @xmath60 and the diffusion coefficient could be determined .",
    "bcd1 and edbd simulate the same situation and therefore the results should be the same .",
    "figure([f.6 ] ) shows an example of the dependence of @xmath0 on the step size obtained using bcd1 .",
    "it appears that the exact value of @xmath0 is more sensitive to the step size than the static structure factor or the cluster size distribution since the latter did not depend significantly on the step size for @xmath61 .",
    "the value extrapolated to @xmath62 is the same as the value found with edbd within the simulation error .",
    "similar results were obtained at different volume fractions and interaction strengths .",
    "the fact that these very different simulation methods lead to the same results , strengthens confidence in both methods . in terms of computational efficiency",
    "both methods are equivalent .",
    "a comparison of the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath63 obtained with bcd using the 3 different movement steps is shown in fig.([f.7 ] ) for two different volume fractions ( 0.15 and 0.49 ) and two different well widths ( 0.1 and 0.5 ) .",
    "the range of @xmath63 that can be explored is limited by the liquid - liquid or liquid - crystal phase separation that occurs at strong attraction .",
    "the values of @xmath0 shown in fig.([f.7 ] ) were obtained at a single value of @xmath33 , but for a few examples the effect of @xmath33 was determined , which showed that they were about @xmath64 smaller than the values extrapolated to @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath0 decreases strongly with increasing attraction when the bonds are rigid ( bcd2 ) . in this case",
    "the displacement of bound spheres is equal to that of the center of mass of the clusters to which they belong .",
    "the size of the clusters increases rapidly with increasing attraction and beyond a critical value a transient ( bond ) percolating network is formed .",
    "spheres that are part of the network are immobile until the bonds that tie them to the network are broken . a detailed study of the diffusion coefficient of square well fluids forming rigid bonds using bcd2 has been reported recently @xcite .",
    "it was shown that @xmath0 decreases with increasing @xmath63 following a power law for large @xmath63 and only becomes zero when the bonds are irreversible , i.e. @xmath65 .    in comparison , the influence of attraction on @xmath0 is weak when the bonds are flexible , i.e. using edbd , bcd1 or bcd3 . the difference between methods bcd1 ( edbd ) and bcd3 is that for the latter clusters move faster ( zimm dynamics ) so that @xmath0 is slightly larger .",
    "the effect increases with increasing cluster size and is expected to be maximal close to the percolation threshold .",
    "the values of @xmath63 at the bond percolation thresholds are about @xmath66 at @xmath53 for both well widths , while at @xmath67 they are 0.5 and 1.2 for @xmath54 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "the difference between the two methods decreases for larger @xmath63 when most spheres belong to the percolating network that has no center of mass movement .",
    "the few remaining free spheres are mostly monomers so that the movement steps bcd1 and bcd3 become equivalent .",
    "regardless of the method , the effect of attraction on @xmath0 is qualitatively different if the bonds are flexible , because in that case bound spheres can move freely within the interaction range .",
    "@xmath0 increases weakly with increasing attraction until it reaches a maximum beyond which it decreases .",
    "the relative amplitude of the increase is very small for the volume fractions studied here , but becomes important at higher volume fractions @xcite .",
    "it is at the origin of the so - called reentrant glass transition of interacting spheres as a function of the attraction strength @xcite .",
    "the influence of attraction on the critical slowing down of hard spheres has attracted a lot of attention in the recent past and has been investigated for square well fluids using edbd simulations @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a maximum diffusion coefficient can be qualitatively understood by considering two opposing effects .",
    "on one hand , attraction causes clustering of particles so that more space is created in which monomers and clusters can diffuse freely , leading to faster diffusion of the spheres . on the other hand ,",
    "bonds restrict the motion of spheres and the long time diffusion of bound spheres is equal to the center of mass diffusion of the clusters to which they belong .",
    "the restriction becomes more important as the average bond life time increases .",
    "when the attraction is weak the average bond life time is still small so that the effect of restriction is weak and the effect of creating more free space dominates leading to an increase of @xmath0 . with increasing @xmath63",
    "the clusters become larger and the average bond life time increases until the effect of increasing restriction of the movement becomes more important than the effect of increasing free volume so that @xmath0 decreases .",
    "these features are independent of the volume fraction and the well width .",
    "the effect of attraction on the diffusion coefficient remains small in the single phase regime if the bonds are flexible atleast for @xmath69 .",
    "bcd and edbd simulations of hard spheres interacting with a square well potential lead to steady states that have almost the same structure factor and the cluster size distribution .",
    "edbd assumes flexible bonds and ignores hydrodynamic interaction .",
    "the values of the self diffusion coefficient obtained by edbd are very close to those obtained with bcd if the same assumptions are used .",
    "a weak maximum of @xmath0 is found as a function of the interaction strength caused by the opposing effects of increasing free volume and increasing bond life time .",
    "the effect of intra - cluster hydrodynamics ( zimm dynamics ) and bond rigidity can be explored with bcd . introducing rigid bonds",
    "leads to a strong decrease of @xmath0 with increasing attraction and suppresses the maximum . introducing intra - cluster hydrodynamics to the system with flexible bonds",
    "weakly increases @xmath0 at a given interaction strength .",
