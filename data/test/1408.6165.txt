    "proton transfer is of great general importance to many processes in chemical and bio - chemical reactions .",
    "historically , it appeared first in the context of the fast proton charge transport in water and ice .",
    "what is crucial is that the high mobility of the proton stems from the fact that it does not move freely but is passed by successive water molecules via the so - called grotthuss mechanism @xcite .",
    "recently the polymeric systems which conduct protons in the absence of any water have become the subject of intensive research .",
    "this can be associated with the fact that proton conductivity of some water containing compounds suffers from substantial proton conductivity decrease with decreasing degree of hydration . in most cases",
    "it takes place at temperatures close to the boiling point of water ( @xmath3 k ) .",
    "so , the promising strategy is to substitute water with a high boiling proton solvent ( e.g. the benzimidazole with the melting temperature @xmath4 k ) .",
    "there are also other anhydrous proton conductors as the solid acids with the formula @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a metal like cs , k , rb or an organic monovalent cation and @xmath7 is the tetrahedral anionic group , where @xmath8s , se , p , as @xcite . in the phase with high conductivity they exhibit anhydrous proton transport with conductivities of the order of @xmath9 s@xmath10 at the temperature of about 400450 k.",
    "there have been many attempts to describe the properties of proton conductors using the soliton approach @xcite , the polaron mechanism @xcite , the md calculation @xcite , and recently the kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) method @xcite .",
    "although the description of the mechanism of proton mobility still can not be regarded as satisfactory , it seems that the key elements are common for a wide range of compounds . in a similar fashion to the proton conductivity in water",
    "they are realized by a two - stage mechanism @xcite consisting of thermally induced structural reorganization ( e.g. , rotations of the tetrahedra for the solid acids ) and proton tunneling in hydrogen bonds ( h - bonds ) .    because the diffusion of protons is performed along hydrogen - bond networks whose",
    "dimensionality varies from 0 to 3 @xcite , a low - dimensional model can also be a good candidate for realistic compounds @xcite .",
    "an example is the microscopic model introduced by pavlenko and stasyuk @xcite where besides the proton transport mechanism , the effect of displacement of the nearest oxygens during hydrogen - bond formation is also introduced , leading to the polaronic effect . in this quantum mechanical model",
    "a two - stage mechanism is realized in a zigzag hydrogen - bonded chain by the creation and annihilation of quasiparticles with two transfer parameters corresponding to rotations and tunnelings .",
    "unfortunately , computational difficulties require additional simplifications , such as the use of linear response kubo theory , but even then only small systems can be examined .",
    "then a natural way to explore the grotthuss mechanism is to use numerical simulations that have become an indispensable tool for the investigation of various physical processes .",
    "one of the principal methods is molecular dynamics simulations which are very often applied to mass transport problems , with time scale of the order of nanoseconds .",
    "however , to achieve the typical time scale for proton transport @xcite the time scale of the order of microseconds is required .",
    "such time scales are not accessible to conventional molecular dynamics , but can be accessed with the kmc approach @xcite . moreover , the kmc - based simulations are simple enough to effectively test the hypothesis arising from the experiment but they are also capable of covering all the necessary constituents responsible for protons dynamics .",
    "the main aim of our paper is to propose the microscopic model of proton conductivity in anhydrous proton conductors , such as polymeric systems or solid acids . in order to verify its usefulness ,",
    "proton conductivity results have been compared with the experimental data for a polycrystalline sample of the benzimidazole .",
    "our research can shed some light on proton mobility in anhydrous systems .",
    "since the proton diffusion process may be divided into sub - processes separated in time and localized in space , as is the case of the grotthuss mechanism , the kmc method is a natural choice for the analysis of phenomena during protons flow . as the model system",
    "we propose a chain of parallel rigid rods whose ends can be occupied by protons , one proton per end .",
    "rods with or without protons can independently rotate by the angle @xmath11 .",
    "protons can also migrate by hopping from one rod to the nearest one provided the end of the adjacent rod is empty ( see fig .  [ plot01 ] ) .",
    "rods should be considered as , e.g. , benzimidazole molecules making the @xmath12 flip or the one - dimensional realization of tetrahedral anionic groups in the solid acids . in turn",
    ", the hopping from one rod to the neighboring one corresponds to the transfer of a proton in a hydrogen bond which is created between electronegative atoms of neighboring anionic groups .",
    "the number of protons in the system may be freely adjusted from 0 to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of rods .",
    "it gives us more flexibility than is possible in nature where only specific concentrations of protons are realized @xcite . by the proton concentration we mean the ratio @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of protons .",
    "that may but do not have to lead to a different configuration ( this happens if the rotating rod is not occupied or occupied by two protons ) .",
    "lower arrows represent acceptable hoppings of a proton between the neighboring rods for the particular configuration in the picture .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions permit a hop from the rightmost rod to the leftmost one.,width=321 ]    in the presence of the external electric field the proton diffusion is ordered . to make the current flow possible the periodic boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "the kmc method yields time evolution of the system , thus if we count protons crossing a specified position in a chain then we are able to calculate the proton current . at this stage of our considerations",
    "only dc current is considered .",
    "the time - evolution of the system is realized by a jump of a particle from one local energy minimum to another . for this purpose",
    "one needs to know _ a priori _ all transition rates from every configuration to every other allowed one @xcite .",
    "it may happen that after a transition the system will be in the same configuration , e.g. , when a rod without protons rotates .",
    "will be drawn the system is transformed to configuration number 2.,width=317,height=196 ]    when all allowed configurations and all transition rates are known the kmc method gives the answer to the questions of how long the system remains in the same configuration and to what configuration it will evolve @xcite . if we denote by @xmath17 the transition rate from configuration @xmath18 to @xmath19 and define @xmath20 then the system will be transformed to configuration @xmath21 satisfying the following relation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of all possible configurations accessible from @xmath18 and @xmath24 is a number from the uniform distribution that has to be generated ( see fig .  [ plot02 ] ) .",
    "the selection of a new configuration using eq .",
    "( [ ordern ] ) costs the time of order @xmath25 , but we may speed up this process significantly by applying the binning method @xcite for the kmc algorithm . in this case",
    "transition rates are stored on the special binary tree which reduces the computational time to the order of @xmath26 .",
    "another uniform random number , @xmath27 , is necessary to determine the life - time of the configuration @xmath18 using the following formula : @xmath28 according to the assumption that the lifetime follows the poisson distribution , which is a manifestation of the presumption that all transitions are independent .",
    "when the new configuration @xmath21 is chosen we repeat the above steps treating @xmath21 as the starting configuration .",
    "as the elementary charge is carried by a single proton , it is energetically unfavorable when two protons occupy both minima of the same h - bond ( in hydrogen - bonded systems such an orientational defect is referred as bjerrum @xmath29 defect ) , or if both minima are not occupied ( bjerrum @xmath30 defect ) because of interacting electron clouds .",
    "this is included in our model by introducing an additional boltzmann factor .",
    "in the presented model these defects give rise to transition rates only when they appear together ( see fig .",
    "[ plot03 ] ) , so without the loss of generality we assume the energies of both defects to be equal to @xmath31 and the corresponding boltzmann factor is equal to @xmath32 according to hassan _",
    "_ @xcite the energies of @xmath29 and @xmath30 defects for ice are similar and of order 0.4 ev .        for all other situations , including inverse ones to that in fig .",
    "[ plot03 ] , i.e. , those in which before the rotation two protons occupy both minima in one h - bond and there are no protons in the second h - bond , we put @xmath33 .",
    "finally , the transition rate for a rotation , @xmath34 , is given by    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is frequency of rotation alone .",
    "the grotthuss mechanism consists of two kind of processes : the hoppings and the rotations .",
    "thus the behavior of the current is modeled by the ratio of the characteristic frequencies for hopping ( @xmath37 ) and rotation ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "as the the relative frequency varies we observe a nontrivial crossover behavior of the proton current around @xmath38 ( see fig .  [ plot04 ] ) . in the rotation - dominated regime",
    "the thick dashed line has slope equal to 1 resulting in the linear dependence of the proton current on the relative frequency .",
    "it is a consequence of the fact that protons are supplied `` on time '' by rotating molecules .",
    "contrary to this in the tunneling - dominated regime the current saturates within a broad relative frequency range .",
    "this means that when the tunneling frequency is very high , rotating molecules are not able to transfer protons on quickly enough .     for the half - filling case @xmath39 .",
    "the individual curves are parametrized by the coulomb potential @xmath31.,width=317,height=196 ]    it is worth stressing that although the plot was made for the proton concentration @xmath39 a similar dependence can be observed for the proton concentration @xmath40 .",
    "the only difference is that far from @xmath39 the dependence on @xmath31 vanishes for @xmath41 , while for @xmath42 the differences between curves with different values of @xmath31 are reduced by some orders of magnitude in comparison to the case with @xmath39 .      as one",
    "can see in fig .",
    "[ plot04 ] there is a nonmonotonic dependence of the current with respect to the coulomb potential @xmath31 at half - filling . in the tunneling - dominated regime a monotonic decrease of the current with @xmath31 can be observed whereas the maximal current is for a nonvanishing potential in the rotation - dominated regime .",
    "as one leaves the vicinity of the half filling , then the behavior is monotonic over a wide range of relative frequency .    .",
    "the temperature and the external electric field are fixed.,width=321,height=198 ]    in order to examine the concentration dependence of the current we fixed the relative frequency at @xmath43 which naturally means we are in the rotation - dominated regime .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ plot05 ] the positions of points are symmetrical about @xmath39 , which is a reflection of the particle - hole symmetry in the model . for @xmath44  ev the current has a maximum at @xmath39 .",
    "the current slowly rises with the increase of @xmath31 to reach the maximum at about @xmath45  ev which is of the order of the thermal energy ( @xmath46  k in fig .",
    "[ plot05 ] ) . above this value",
    "the local minimum appears at @xmath39 instead of maximum together with two local maxima traveling from @xmath39 to approximately @xmath47 . for @xmath48",
    "ev the minimum goes to zero , while maxima are stable in their values .",
    "this peculiar behavior stems from the fact that the flow of protons is possible when , after a rod rotation the proton meets a vacancy on the neighboring rod .",
    "this happens when the symmetry of the proton arrangement in the chain is not too high .",
    "when @xmath44 and an external electric field is weak , protons ( vacancies ) have a tendency to form uniform clusters , which inhibits proton diffusion",
    ". a large value of @xmath31 results in the high - symmetry configurations ( one proton per rod on the same end of each rod ) so the presence of protons in the neighboring minima is very unfavorable , which implies a loss of current flow .",
    "therefore , a small value of @xmath31 is optimal for a fast diffusion .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with the theoretical predictions derived in the one - dimensional lattice gas model @xcite for small values of @xmath31 .",
    "the initial growth of the current with the proton concentration is also in agreement with data observed experimentally , e.g. for nafion , for different values of hydration @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the conductivity for mobile ions in a two - dimensional periodic potential @xcite also exhibits the absolute minimum at @xmath39 , though it has a richer behavior where more minima and maxima are present .",
    "the main idea behind the kinetic monte carlo method is to use transition rates that depend on the energy barrier between the states .",
    "a technical issue is to choose appropriate method to determine the transitions rates .",
    "when the rate constants of all processes are known , we can perform the kmc simulations in the time domain .",
    "it is worth noting that in our model the presence of the external electric field modifies rod rotations as well as proton hoppings .",
    "herein , the internal rotations of rods are treated as the thermally activated process satisfying the arrhenius law    @xmath49 \\;.\\label{rr}\\ ] ]    this formula together with eq .",

    "we assume that these values do not depend on temperature .",

    "it is noteworthy that for a vanishing electric field the solutions of eq .",

    "let us note that when changing the angle between the chain and the applied field , then changing the two lowest states of the quantum rotor . since the individual chains are distributed randomly in a macroscopic sample , we have to take this into account .",
    "the migration of a proton from one rod to another represents the hopping between the minima of the h - bond potential .",
    "hopping is defined as the thermally assisted tunneling which is an extension of the purely classical arrhenius behavior .",

    "<S> there is a widespread belief that this mechanism is responsible for fast proton mobility . </S>",
    "<S> we showed in detail that the relative frequency of reorientation and diffusion processes is crucial for the conductivity . </S>",
