    "it is important to understand how a binary star system forms from a molecular gas cloud because most main - sequence stars are in binary or multiple systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , recent observations indicate that companions may be even more common for pre - main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that it is difficult for single stars to capture another one and to form a binary system in the main sequence phase @xcite .",
    "accordingly , most stars seem to be born as binaries rather than single stars in a gas cloud , and molecular bipolar outflows are often observed in star forming regions .",
    "it has been shown using two - dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations that outflow plays an important role in the star formation process because the excess angular momentum , which is conserved from the host cloud , is removed by these outflows from the formed core @xcite .",
    "these outflows are caused by the twisted magnetic field lines made by the rotation near the adiabatic core . in order to investigate the cloud fragmentation and later binary star formation , three - dimensional calculation is required . in this letter , we discuss fragmentation in the course of star formation which leads to binary star formation .",
    "fragmentation of isothermal cloud is studied by many authors using three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the criterion for an initially uniform cloud to fragment is described by @xmath0 ( thermal - to - gravitational energy ratio ) of less than @xmath1 if we restrict ourselves to the isothermal gas .",
    "the cloud with @xmath2 experiences the run - away collapse @xcite .",
    "when the gas density increases up to @xmath3  @xmath4 , the isothermal gas approximation breaks down .",
    "recently , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have studied the cloud evolution from isothermal to adiabatic state using a barotropic equation of state and they clarified the evolution of the cloud with no magnetic field . however , there are few papers on the fragmentation of the magnetized cloud .",
    "@xcite studied the fragmentation taking account of radiative transfer with the eddington approximation instead of barotropic equation of state , but simplified the effect of magnetic field . in his studies , the angular momentum transfer by the magnetic field is ignored .",
    "however , the angular momentum is largely removed by magnetic braking and molecular outflow in the cloud evolution process @xcite . therefore , to explore the fragmentation of the magnetized cloud ,",
    "full three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamical mhd simulations are necessary .    here , we employ the nested grid mhd code , which always maintains sufficient spatial resolution in the central region .",
    "the nested grid method is powerful to study the star formation process , because this requires a large dynamic range in spatial dimensions . in the simulations",
    ", we use the barotropic equation of state instead of inclusion of radiative transfer . in this study",
    ", we calculate the non - axisymmetric dynamical contraction of the cloud from @xmath5 @xmath4 to @xmath6 @xmath4 in number density , and investigate how fragmentation proceeds and outflow occurs in the course of binary star formation .",
    "to study the star formation ( binary star formation and their outflow ) in the filamentary cloud @xcite , we consider a cylindrical isothermal cloud in hydrostatic balance as the initial condition . the cloud is assumed to rotate parallel with a rotation axis which coincides with the cylindrical axis and the magnetic field lines are assumed to run parallel to the rotation axis , because magnetic field lines often turn to the cylindrical axis @xcite .",

    "the cylindrical gas cloud collapses to become spherical in shape in the early collapse phase .",
    "if the initial gas cloud has neither magnetic field nor rotation speed , the cloud continues to collapse spherically and it forms into a small massive core in the center of the cloud @xcite even in a cylindrical cloud @xcite . in the case of a gas cloud with magnetic fields or rotation ,",
    "it collapses to form a pseudo - disk due to the magnetic pressure or centrifugal force @xcite .",
    "if only the axisymmetric perturbation exists , a round disk is formed , but it does not fragment as long as the axisymmetry holds .",
    "when the non - axisymmetric perturbation is added , the cloud evolves to form a non - axisymmetric shape , and fragments later for some range of the parameters . in any case , the central density ( @xmath9 ) increases with time and the gas becomes adiabatic when @xmath44 . for convenience ,",
    "we divide the evolution into two phases : collapse phase ( @xmath45 ) and accretion phase ( @xmath46 ) . in this equation of state",
    ", the temperature gradually increases near @xmath47 , however , the solution acquired in @xmath48 is almost the same as that obtained for the isothermal collapse .",

    "[ fig:1]_a _ , a model without non - axisymmetric perturbations ( @xmath54 ) is shown .",
    "model parameters @xmath55 correspond to the cloud with a weak magnetic field and slow rotation .",
    "this cloud collapses almost spherically and forms a small spherical core at the center of the cloud .",
    "we have no evidence of fragmentation in this model . on the other hand , in the studies of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", fragmentation occurs in this parameter .",
    "however , their results are not inconsistent to ours , taking account of the fact that the magnetic braking is ignored in their calculation .",
    "we also found a strong outflow is driven near the adiabatic core after the central density reaches @xmath56 ( lower panel ) .    a model with small non - axisymmetric perturbation ( @xmath57 )",
    "is shown in the middle panel ( b):(@xmath58 . in this model ,",
    "a pseudo - disk is formed in the isothermal collapse phase , because the gas cloud is rotating rapidly ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the disk evolves into a ring in the accretion phase , and fragmentation occurs on the inner edge of the ring .",
    "two contracting cores at @xmath60 = ( @xmath61 ) and ( @xmath62 ) are formed .",
    "the right panel ( c):@xmath63 shows the model with a large amplitude of non - axisymmetric perturbations ( @xmath64 ) . in this case , non - axisymmetric patterns grow sufficiently in the isothermal collapse phase and a bar is formed at the beginning of the accretion phase . in the accretion phase , the bar grows longer and thinner .",
    "the bar fragments and forms two contracting cores [ @xmath65=@xmath66 . fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows that there are at least two kinds of fragmentation : fragmentation from a ring ( b ) and from a bar ( c ) .",
    "[ fig:1]_c _ shows that lobes of outflow are ejected from each contracting core ( @xmath67 ) , whose velocities reach @xmath688 km s@xmath69 . as for the outflow",
    ", low - velocity outflows are seen also in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]_b _ , each of which is connected to the contracting core . in both the bar and ring fragmentations ,",
    "two types of outflows co - exist : the inner one is connected to the cores formed by the fragmentation and driven by their spin motion , and the other is driven by the rotation motion of the ring or the bar . however , the strength of the outflow is different for respective fragmentation patterns .",
    "fast outflows appear in the bar fragmentation ( c ) , while weak ones appear in the ring fragmentation ( b ) .",
    "this difference comes from the angular momentum distribution between the spin motion of the cores and their orbital angular momentum . in the ring fragmentation",
    ", the fragments have the angular momentum in the form of orbital angular momentum .",
    "on the other hand , in the bar fragmentation , the angular momentum is almost evenly shared between the spin and the orbital angular momenta . in the model of fig .",
    "[ fig:1]_c _ , the fragments are expected to merge each other due to their small orbital angular momentum . +",
    "as mentioned in   [ sec : results ] , modes of fragmentation and shapes of the outflow depend on the growth of non - axisymmetry .",
    "this shows that the cloud evolution can be classified by this growth . in order to characterize the shape of the central region",
    ", we define oblateness ( @xmath70 ) and axis ratio ( @xmath71 ) as follows : @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 mean the length of the long- , short- , and @xmath35-axis for the gas with @xmath76 , respectively ( see * ? ? ? * for definition of @xmath38 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , the oblateness and the axis ratio of the central region are plotted for all models at the beginning of the accretion phase ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "curves in this figure illustrate the evolutionary tracks for four different models ( @xmath78)= ( 0.01 , 0.01 , 0.5 ) , ( 0.2 , 0.1 , 0.5 ) , ( 0.2 , 1 , 0.5 ) , and ( 0.2 , 5 , 0.5 ) .",
    "the clouds evolve from the lower - left corner , which means the early shape is almost spherical , to the upper - right region via the upper - left region .",
    "first , the clouds evolve vertically upward .",
    "this indicates that the oblateness increases .",
    "then , the curves change their directions to the right for three models with @xmath79 .",
    "evolutionary tracks of the high - density region in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] show very clearly that the non - axisymmetric perturbation grows only after the disk is formed .",
    "that is , the axis ratio increases after the oblateness grows considerably large ( @xmath80 ) . because the gas is partially supported in the radial direction by the magnetic pressure and the centrifugal force , the radial contraction is more delayed than that of the @xmath35-direction . as a result ,",
    "the disk is formed ( @xmath81 ) earlier for models with larger @xmath26 and @xmath82 . in such models , the non - axisymmetry grows sufficiently and forms a large bar in the isothermal collapse phase .",
    "however , the non - axisymmetry hardly evolves in the model with small @xmath26 and @xmath82 , because it takes a long time for disk formation .",
    "adiabatic cores are classified into three types : @xmath83 ( fig.[fig:1]a : @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) , @xmath86 ( fig.[fig:1]b@xmath87 and @xmath85 ) , and @xmath88 ( fig.[fig:1]c : @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) .",
    "some @xmath91 evolve into the rings , in which the central density is lower than that outside , even if it has the same oblateness and the axis ratio .",
    "models are divided into three kinds of evolution : thin - line symbols mean that the models form cores which continue to collapse , while thick - line and filled symbols represent the models in which fragmentation occurs .",
    "although the fragments survive against mutual merger in the models of thick - line symbols , they merge each other in the models of filled symbols .",
    "since the models with thick - line or filled symbol are distributed only in the region @xmath92 , it is concluded that the necessary condition for fragmentation is @xmath92 , which means that a thin disk or bar is necessary for fragmentation . even in the region of @xmath93 , there are exceptional three models in which the adiabatic core evolves to form an almost axisymmetric thin disk or ring because non - axisymmetry is counteracted in the isothermal collapse phase .",
    "the shapes of the @xmath88 and @xmath94 are also seen in @xcite and @xcite . it is concluded that for the adiabatic core to fragment , the central gas needs to form a sufficiently thin disk or bar in the isothermal collapse phase .",
    "the thick - line symbols are distributed in two regions enclosed by circles .",
    "the fragmented cores in the circles seem to evolve into a binary star because the length of the semi - major axis expands or oscillates .",
    "models in which the fragments merge with each other are distributed outside the domain .",
    "outside of the domain , a few fragments survive at the end of the calculation but the separation between the two cores shrinks with time",
    ". these will not grow into binary stars .    in conclusion ,",
    "if the following criteria are fulfilled at the end of the isothermal collapse phase , fragmentation occurs and fragments survive to form binary or multiple stars .",
    "1 .   @xmath92 : fragmentation condition .",
    "2 .   @xmath95 , or @xmath96 : survival condition against merger .",
    "the symbol in this figure indicates the shape of the adiabatic core when the fragmentation occurs or the calculation ends .",
    "[ fig:2 ] confirms the idea that the fragmentation occurs from a ring ( @xmath97 ) or bar ( @xmath98 ) and not from a core ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "we showed the domain which may evolve into binary stars in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . outside the binary - forming domain ,",
    "the core formation model ( @xmath99 ) results in a compact massive core at the center of cloud .",
    "the bar - fragmentation model ( @xmath98 ) in which the mutual merger of the fragments occurred also leads to a disk - like core at the center of cloud .",
