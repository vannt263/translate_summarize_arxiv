    "since the pioneering work by bond ( 1970 ) , in the past few decades much observational effort has been devoted to searching for very metal poor stars . as a consequence , one is dealing with an increasing evidence for metal deficient stars membering the galactic halo ( see , e.g. , molaro & castelli 1990 , primas et al .",
    "1994 , sneden et al . 1994 ) , renewing the interest in theoretical constraints concerning the evolution of similar very metal poor objects . as matter of fact , even if the approach to the evolution of metal deficient stars dates to the early seventies , this argument is still open to investigation . in a preliminary paper cassisi & castellani ( 1993 ) presented a rather extensive investigation of the theoretical scenario concerning these peculiar stellar objects .",
    "however , their analysis was mainly devoted to the study of the  ( see below ) in low mass stars as well as to the determination of the lower mass limit ( @xmath0 ) for quiet carbon ignition in more massive stars .",
    "this scenario has been recently improved by cassisi et al .",
    "( 1995 ; paper i ) who investigated h and he burning phases for low mass , metal deficient stars , presenting theoretical isochrones for ages in the range 7 - 15 billion of years and discussing the evolutionary expectations for rr - lyrae stars .    according to these results",
    ", one finds that old population iii and population ii stars have been rather extensively investigated in the literature .",
    "however , the evidence is increasing for dwarfs spheroidals being metal poor systems , but , i.e. , not as old as galactic globular clusters are .",
    "such an evidence has recently suggested the opportunity to extend to larger masses evolutionary computations concerning metal poor stellar structures .",
    "accordingly , castellani & deglinnocenti ( 1995 ) have discussed the evolutionary behavior of stars up to about @xmath1 , for the two selected choices on the amount of heavy elements : @xmath2 , extending in such a way previous investigations of metal poor stars to cluster ages lower than 1 gyr .",
    "however , suggestions have been advanced for the occurrence in dwarf spheroidal of a not negligible spread of metallicities , with the possible occurrence of stars with even lower values of z. on this basis , caputo & deglinnocenti ( 1995 ) have recently speculated about the possible occurrence of metal deficient he burning pulsators . due to the lack of investigation on the evolutionary scenario concerning similar metal deficient , but not too old , stellar systems , it is obviously interesting to extend to lower metallicities the evolutionary scenario presented in the above referred literature",
    ".    this paper will present the results of such an investigations , as performed exploring the evolutionary behavior of stars with @xmath3 , a metallicity value adopted as suitable lower limit for the amount of heavy elements in dwarf spheroidal systems . in section 2",
    "we will discuss the h burning evolution for the given choice on the stellar metallicity .",
    "starting from these results , section 3 will deal with the results concerning he burning phases .",
    "a final discussion will close the paper .",
    "in order to extend the theoretical scenario concerning stars with @xmath4 down to cluster ages of about 1 gyr , evolutionary tracks already presented in paper i for the quoted metallicity have been implemented with new tracks for suitable choices of the stellar masses .",
    "all the computations have been performed adopting a cosmological abundance of he as given by @xmath5 .",
    "as well known , the modality of he ignition significantly depends on the total mass of the evolving giant . for each given stellar population (",
    "i.e. , for each assumed value of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , one may define a critical mass @xmath8 as the upper mass limits for stars experiencing strong electron degeneracy of the he core during the h shell burning phase and - thus - igniting he through one or more violent he flashes .",
    "one finds that evolutionary features of red giant ( rg ) stars with masses around @xmath8 change in a remarkable way in a range of only few tenths of solar mass , an occurrence already known as  ( rgt ) ( see sweigart , greggio & renzini 1989 , hereafter sgr , sweigart , greggio & renzini 1990 , castellani et al . 1992 ) .    the behavior of our z=@xmath9 models through the transition is shown in figure 1 , which shows the dependence of @xmath10 ( the mass of the he core at the he ignition ) and @xmath11 ( the star luminosity at the tip of rgb ) on the stellar mass .",
    "according to sweigart & gross ( 1978 ) and sgr , the onset of the helium flash has been taken at the model where the contribution of @xmath12 reactions to the energetic reaches @xmath13 ; for structures which quietly ignite helium , the he ignition has been alternatively fixed at the first appearance of a convective core",
    ". the sudden variation of @xmath11 around m=@xmath14 indicates that this stellar mass is near the transition between low mass stars developing full degenerate helium cores and more massive structures where electron degeneracy is progressively removed . as in previous investigations , if one defines the critical mass @xmath8 as the mass of the star having at the he ignition a he core mass equal to the average value between the he core of fully degenerated structures and the absolute minimum in @xmath10 , when z=@xmath9 one finds @xmath8 of the order of @xmath15 .",
    "table 1 reports selected evolutionary parameters for all the computed models , allowing a quantitative inspection of the rgb transition .",
    "figure 2 compares the amount of extrahelium brought to the surface by the first dredge up with similar data but for the larger metallicities investigated in paper i. as already discussed in castellani & deglinnocenti ( 1995 ) , for each given metallicity one finds a stellar mass separating the regime of low mass stars where @xmath16 increases when the stellar mass is increased from more massive stars with opposite behavior .",
    "such an occurrence as well as the dependence of @xmath16 on the star metallicity can be easily understood in terms of the discussion given by castellani & deglinnocenti ( 1995 ) .",

    "present results have been implemented with similar data given by cassisi & castellani ( 1993 ) or by sgr for lower or larger metallicities , respectively .",
    "the dependence of @xmath8 on z has been already discussed ( see cassisi and castellani 1993 ) and this discussion will not be repeated here . as a relevant point figure 3b discloses the dependence on the metallicity of the cluster age at the helium ignition in stars with mass m=@xmath8 .",
    "it appears that when z=@xmath9 the transition requires ages of the order of about 2.2 gyr , i.e. , a much larger age than for the z=@xmath17 case . as a consequence , in a dwarf galaxy with star metallicities ranging from z=@xmath9 to z=@xmath17 and ages around 1 gyr ,",
    "the red giant branch is expected to be populated by the more metal rich stars only . as a result",
    ", one finds that the distribution of metallicity of rg can not taken in all cases as a bona fide indicator of the distribution of star metallicity in  metal poor systems .",
    "evolutionary models , as computed for the case z=@xmath9 allow us to extend toward lower ages the set of isochrones presented in paper i. this is shown in figure 4 where we report selected isochrones for h burning stellar structures covering cluster ages from 0.8 to 7gyrs .",
    "evolutionary data for h burning stars , as given in the previous section , allow to investigate the evolution of stellar structures along the he burning evolutionary phase , following a procedure quite similar to that used in investigating the evolutionary properties of low mass he burning stars in galactic globular clusters .",
    "for each assumption concerning the chemical composition and the age of a cluster , one obtains from h - burning evolutionary computations the mass of stars at the he ignition ( @xmath18 ) and both the he core mass ( @xmath10 ) and the amount of extrahelium @xmath16 brought at the surface by the first dredge up .",
    "when all these quantities are known , zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) models can be obtained , computing the sequence of stellar structures , burning helium inside a he core of mass @xmath10 , surrounded by an envelope enriched by @xmath16 , with a global mass fulfilling the condition that @xmath19 .    however , at variance with the case of old globular cluster stars , the value of @xmath10 is now sensitively depending on the value of @xmath18 , i.e. on the cluster age .",
    "since the luminosity of the zahb is largely dependent on the mass of the he core , one expects a large dependence of the zahb luminosity on the age of the stellar system .",
    "this occurrence is shown in figure 5 , where zahb locations for the various labeled assumptions about the cluster ages are plotted .",
    "table 2 gives selected evolutionary quantities for all the computed zahb models .",

    ", one finds that for each given value of @xmath10 , increasing the mass of the envelope , the temperature in the h burning shell continuously increases whereas the density decreases .",
    "the behavior of the central condition is almost specular , since increasing the stellar mass the density increases and the temperature , slightly , decreases . as a result ,",
    "the ratio between the luminosity due to h or he burning monotonously increases when the mass of the envelope is increased over the whole explored range of masses .",
    "thus the occurrence of the minimum in temperature can not be related to the relative efficiency of the burning .",
    "the occurrence of this minimum can be much more simply related to the evidence that increasing the stellar mass ( i.e. the mass of the envelope ) , the core and shell - burning regions behave more and more as a central energy source . as a consequence ,",
    "the more massive zahb models shift towards larger effective temperature approaching a ms - like location .",
    "6 ( a to d ) show the evolutionary paths in the hr diagram of the models in figure 5 during the phase of central and shell he burning .",
    "as already recognized for larger metallicity by caputo & deglinnocenti ( 1995 ) , one finds that the allowed range in magnitude of he burning red giants increases when the cluster age decreases .",
    "thus the observed range of magnitudes can be used to put an upper limit to the age of stellar systems even in the @xmath4 case . as for the post - hb evolution ,",
    "all computed models have envelopes massive enough to make them approach their hayashi tracks during the double shell burning phase .    in both figures 5 and 6",
    "( a to d ) we report the temptative location of the region for pulsational instability , allowing a discussion of the possible occurrence of variable stars in stellar populations with z=@xmath9 .",
    "as well known , old very metal poor systems can not produce zahb pulsators since the zahb locations are in all cases hotter than the instability strip . according to cassisi et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , this is the case for metallicities @xmath20 and ages larger than about 7 gyrs .",
    "as expected , now one finds that , for ages smaller than - about - 5.1 gyrs metal deficient clusters start allowing zahb pulsators . decreasing the cluster age , the range of masses in the instability strip increases . for ages of about 2.8 - 2.9 gyrs",
    "one finds that all zahb models more massive than @xmath21 are inside the instability strip . in similar clusters one should expect an anomalous clump of he burning pulsating stars .",
    "however , a detailed discussion on the pulsational scenario concerning similar metal poor variables is beyond the aim of the present work . for a deeper investigation on the pulsational properties of these metal poor stars",
    ", we will address to a forthcoming paper ( bono et al .",
    "1996 ) .    figures 7 ( a to d ) and 8 ( a to d ) show the time evolution of luminosity and effective temperature of the models in figures 6 ( a to d ) during both central and shell he burning phases .    without enter into a detailed discussion ,",
    "let us only notice the progressive increase of the he central burning lifetimes when the cluster age is decreased .",
    "this is the expected result of the corresponding decrease of the mass of the he - core in zahb models . as a consequence ,",
    "one expects an increasing evidence for he - burning giants which will eventually dominate the cluster giant population .",
    "this paper investigates the evolutionary properties of relatively massive , metal deficient stellar structures .",
    "the first part of the investigation has been devoted to h burning stars , presenting selected isochrones for ages in the range 800 myr - 7 gyr , increasing the range of ages covered by previous investigations .    selected sets of hb models",
    "have been computed under different assumptions about the ages of the stellar system .",
    "we confirm the results already given for larger stellar metallicities about the possible , and sometime probable , occurrence of anomalous , overluminous variable stars , in relatively young , metal deficient system .",
