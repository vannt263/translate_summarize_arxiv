    "stochastic processes play an increasingly important role in mathematical finance as evidenced by the large and growing literature on stochastic volatility models@xcite .",
    "often these theories are expressed in terms of stochastic ordinary differential equations ( sodes ) .",
    "examples include the cox - ingersoll - ross@xcite , hull - white@xcite , log ornstein - uhlenbeck@xcite , nelson@xcite , affine@xcite and log - linear@xcite models of stochastic volatility .",
    "other schemes like arch models@xcite use discrete time difference equations which can be viewed as approximations to diffusions@xcite , and which are often favored for computational and other reasons .",
    "sode based models tend to have closer relationships to fundamental theory , but have the drawback that analytic solutions are rarely known . in general these equations must be solved using numerical approximation schemes .",
    "numerical methods for sodes have a long history@xcite but until recently these algorithms have not achieved the speed and accuracy characteristic of analogous methods for deterministic ordinary differential equations ( odes)@xcite . this is partly due to the lack of variable - stepsize algorithms which allow for the control of local error , and partly due to a lack of sufficiently high order algorithms .",
    "the maple stochastic package@xcite , for example , fails to include variable - stepsize routines and most methods are of rather low order .",
    "potential solutions to both of these problems have been reported in the last few years .",
    "discussions of variable stepsize strategies for sodes@xcite and some basic observations regarding taylor expansions for sodes@xcite have led to the emergence of a number of published@xcite and unpublished@xcite variable - stepsize codes .",
    "these algorithms also have a number of promising additional features such as linear scaling of computational cost with numbers of wiener processes .    in this manuscript",
    "we perform a variety of tests to see whether the algorithms give the expected improved performance and accuracy .",
    "we refer to the method developed by wilkie and etinba@xcite as sde9 , and the unpublished commercial method@xcite as anise .",
    "we will not attempt to discuss how these codes work but merely focus on their performance .",
    "we do not consider other variable - stepsize codes such as the weak method introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite since they have restricted domains of applicability .",
    "the methods sde9 and anise when applied to an it stochastic differential equation @xmath0 for an observable @xmath1 with wiener processes @xmath2 require knowledge of the partial derivatives of the solutions , i.e. , @xmath3 all of the problems we consider are formulated with it stochastic differential equations and we provide these derivatives for each problem .",
    "anise and sde9 are more easily applied to stratonovich stochastic differential equations @xmath4 for which @xmath5 extensions to jump diffusions@xcite are also straightforward , but are not considered here .",
    "our study shows that both sde9 and anise yield accurate solutions to a wide variety of stochastic volatility models .",
    "anise tends to be about twice as fast as sde9 . for one problem",
    "we find that anise performs hundreds of times faster than sde9 .",
    "both methods provide a means of obtaining high accuracy solutions to sode problems , and may prove to be useful quantitative tools for further research in mathematical finance .    in section",
    "ii we explore monte - carlo convergence of numerically calculated means and variances of price and volatilities for seven stochastic volatility models taken from the finance literature .",
    "section iii examines the accuracies of the algorithms for individual trajectories .",
    "here our goal is to test the accuracy and compare computational performance for the anise and sde9 numerical methods for sodes discussed in the introduction .",
    "to do this we compare exact and numerically calculated average quantities like mean price and mean volatility for a selection of models from the finance literature .    for each model",
    "we compare known exact average quantities @xmath6 to the numerical averages @xmath7 computed from individual stochastic evolutions @xmath8 for @xmath9 , obtained using the sode methods .",
    "we examine convergence to the exact solution by varying the number of trajectories @xmath10 . for each observable",
    "@xmath6 we calculate the base ten log of the mean relative error , @xmath11,\\ ] ] and plot this against time .",
    "this specific denominator , @xmath12 , is chosen since some observables @xmath1 pass through zero and relative error can therefore blow up .",
    "we also examine the relative cpu times for the two methods .",
    "all calculations were performed on a 600 mhz alpha processor with a requested tolerance of @xmath13 .      in the nelson model@xcite the log - price @xmath14 and volatility @xmath15 obey @xmath16 where the normally distributed real stochastic differentials are uncorrelated and have @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "thus , this model has two wiener processes and two equations .",
    "the derivatives required by the sode methods are given in table [ table : d1 ] .",
    "we employed a time step @xmath19 and integrated to 100 .    .",
    "derivatives for nelson model . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      here",
    "the sode is of the form@xcite @xmath20 which has the exact solution @xmath21.\\ ] ] the derivatives needed by the numerical methods are given in table [ table : indiv ] .",
    "the parameters were chosen as @xmath22 = .05 , @xmath23 = .09 , @xmath24 = .1 , and @xmath25 = .08 .",
    "we set the time step to @xmath26 = 5 and integrated to 10000 . the average relative error is plotted in fig .",
    "15 ( b ) for anise ( solid curve ) and sde9 ( dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "both anise and sde9 return results consistent with the requested tolerance .",
    "once again sde9 returns a better relative tolerance than that requested .",
    "table [ table : models ] contains the cpu times for the two methods .",
    "sde9 takes 75 % longer than anise .",
    "good convergence is obtainable using both anise and sde9 for all the problems considered . in most cases",
    "anise runs roughly twice as fast . for the vasicek model in section iii sde9",
    "performed 40 % faster than anise .",
    "anise performed several hundreds of times faster than sde9 for the affine model in section ii .",
    "in addition to our study of convergence , we examined the accuracy of individual trajectories for a given requested relative accuracy .",
    "we found that both methods returned trajectories with relative accuracies consistent with the accuracy requested , even for very long integration times .",
    "both algorithms appear to be sufficiently accurate for the models considered .",
    "anise performed better overall .",
    "the two methods appear capable of handling larger systems of equations with more wiener processes , and could therefore prove to be valuable computational tools for further research in finance .",
