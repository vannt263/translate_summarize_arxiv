    ", the result of any interferometric experiment done with a single quanta sounds as if the quanta has passed through several paths like a classical wave ( e.g. , the interference pattern forms ) or as if it has passed through just one path like a classical particle ( one special path can be attributed to the quanta ) ; so the experimenter is able to describe the results of such an experiment by use of classical pictures of propagation ( wavelike propagation or particle - like propagation ) in a complementary ( and not contradictory ) way @xcite .",
    "a single quanta showing wavelike behavior in an experiment may exhibit particle - like behavior in another experiment if the setups of the two experiments are mutually exclusive@xcite .",
    "this principle has been verified in many experiments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but path attribution is not essential for disappearance of the interference pattern ; even if the experimenter has merely a potential ability to attribute a special path to the quanta , the interference vanishes@xcite .",
    "for example , when state @xmath0 corresponding to the quanta s path in a two - path interferometer maximally entangles with state @xmath1 of another physical system , such potential ability forms .",
    "in other words , obtaining which - path information becomes possible .",
    "the experimenter is able to measure the ancillary system in the basis @xmath2 and ascribe a special path to the quanta according to the result of the measurement .",
    "there is also another interesting choice of the measurement basis ; the experimenter can destroy the possibility of path attribution by measuring the ancillary system in basis @xmath3 which is unbiased to the basis @xmath2 .",
    "the destruction of this possibility lets the experimenter see the wavelike behavior of the quanta .",
    "it is enough to sort the output data of the interferometry accorrding to the results of such a measurement ; each subensemble of the output data shows interference .",
    "this procedure is called quantum erasing @xcite beacuase the ( potential ) path information is erased .",
    "erasing can be done in various interferometers ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "an arbitrary interaction between the quanta and the ancillary system may lead to an entangled state which is not maximal . in this case , the visibility of the interference decreases .",
    "visibility is defined as    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the probability of detecting the quanta by a detector and the maximization and minimization are against the phase difference between the arms of the interferometer .",
    "many attempts have been made to model this case from wave - particle complementarity s point of view . to achieve this goal ,",
    "wavelike behavior and particle - like behavior should be quantified . in a symmetric two - path interferometer",
    ", visibility is considered to be a measure of wavelike behavior and a quantity called distinguishability is defined as a measure of particle - like behavior :    @xmath6    where l is the average winning chance in a guessing game and differs from @xmath7 to @xmath8  so d differs from @xmath9 to @xmath8 . in this game ( which will be called _ path guessing game _ ) , one of the paths of the interferometer is randomly omitted and the experimenter should guess which one has survived with the help of an appropriate measurement on the ancillary system .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that    @xmath10    this relationship shows the trade - off between wavelike behavior and particle - like behavior expected by wave - particle complementarity .",
    "we should keep in mind that although @xmath11 has been calculated in a guessing game ( with modifications in the setup of interferometry ) , it is recognized as a characteristic of the interferometer itself .    when the ancillary system is initially prepared in a pure state",

    ", we can re - write ( [ d2v2 ] ) as    @xmath12    equation ( [ erasd2 ] ) is re - expressing the quantum erasing procedure .",
    "it indicates that the amount of squared visibility the experimenter can gain by erasing equals the squared distinguishability ( which will be sacrificed in the procedure ) .",
    "inequality ( [ d2v2 ] ) is also valid in an asymmetric two - path interferometer if one modifies the guessing game properly .",
    "@xcite derives an erasure relation setting an upper bound on the visibility of the erasure subensembles for the general case of two - path interferometers .",
    "wavelike and particle - like behavior can be quantified by measures different from visibility and distinguishability . to have a different measure of wavelike behavior",
    ", we consider a game introduced in @xcite . in this game ( which will be called _",
    "phase guessing game _ ) , one of the two phases @xmath13 is randomly applied to a two - path interferometer ",
    "@xmath14 is determined by the particular interferometry setup  and the experimenter should guess which value has been chosen .",
    "while the experimenter s ability to win the game ( to discover the applied phase ) is a measure of wavelike behavior , we use the shannon entropy of the probabilistic guess as a measure of _ lack _ of wavelike behavior .",
    "we also use the shannon entropy of the experimenter s probabilistic guess in the path guessing game as a measure of _ lack _ of particle - like behavior .",
    "the idea of using entropic measures was first proposed by @xcite in 1979 .",
    "although such measures were later used by others ( for example @xcite ) , the idea has had its own critics @xcite . in 2014",
    ", @xcite derived a basic wave - particle duality relation by use of entropic measures and the guessing games .",
    "it showed the equivalence of wave - particle complementarity to entropic uncertainty .    in section",
    "( 2 ) , we derive a relationship like equation ( [ erasd2 ] ) between the shannon entropies for a special category of interferometers which re - expresses the quantum erasing procedure .",
    "the concept of information is usually used to describe quantum erasure , but expressing this phenomena by a standard measure of information clearly confirms that information is playing a role .",
    "a new interferometric setup is proposed in section ( 3 ) as an example of the interferometers of the category .",

    "the quanta experiences the phase shift @xmath16 and arbitrarily interacts with another system .",
    "we consider only the situation that this ancillary system is initially prepared in a pure state .",

    "finally , the quanta passes through @xmath15 and is detected by @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "after these explanations , it is time to play the guessing games and derive the desired relationship .    in the path guessing game ,",
    "one of the paths should be randomly omitted  so the first beamsplitter ( @xmath34 ) is randomly removed or replaced with a perfect reflector . in other words , there is a random variable @xmath35 the upper path is blocked , the lower path is blocked @xmath36 with maximum entropy @xmath37 .",
    "we should guess which path has been blocked each time . we know",

    "we consider that just projective measurements are allowed  so the result is a two - state random variable shown by @xmath40 .",
    "the basis for the measurement which minimizes the conditional shannon entropy @xmath41 is desired .",
    "our calculations confirm that this basis is symmetric to @xmath23 and @xmath27 as shown in figure ( 2 ) ( see @xcite for a proof ) .",
    "it consists of    @xmath42    the entropy obtained by this measurement is shown by @xmath43  this basis is just the one used for calculating distinguishability @xmath11 @xcite . just like @xmath11",
    ", we recognize @xmath43 as a characteristic of the interferometer itself .",
    "it shows the lack of the quanta s particle - like behavior in this setup . the quantity @xmath44 ( mutual information between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) is a measure of particle - like behavior .",

    "the next game is phase guessing .",
    "one of the two values of random variable @xmath49 is randomly applied to the interferometer as the phase difference and we should guess which value has been chosen . in this game , knowing which detector clicks helps us to win the game ; but generally , our guess will be still probabilistic and has the entropy @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 is another random variable defined as @xmath52 clicks , @xmath20 clicks@xmath36 .",
    "additionally , we can use the ancillary system to have a better guess .",
    "we are curious that how much measuring the ancillary system in a basis unbiased to @xmath47 ( sacrificing our ability of path attribution ) helps us to decrease the phase entropy . in other words",
    ", we want to know that how much quantum erasing helps us to find the value of the applied phase .",
    "the bases unbiased to @xmath47 forms a ring on the surface of the bloch sphere ( the dashed ring in figure ( 2 ) ) .",
    "we show these bases with @xmath53 . to find them ,",

    "as we are temporarily limited to @xmath33 , this rotation is about @xmath56 axis .",
    "its angle equals @xmath57 .",
    "we denote the rotation operator by @xmath58 .",
    "so    @xmath59    each erasing basis is characterized by @xmath55 .",
    "the result of a measurement in one of these bases is a two - state random variable shown by @xmath60 . by considering this result , we can have a better guess with entropy @xmath61 .",
    "the non - negative quantity @xmath62 shows how much quantum erasing has helped us to sense the phase .",
    "it is the amount of wavelike behavior which has been exhibited by doing quantum erasing . by analogy with the concept _ which - path information _ , @xmath63 is the amount of _ which - phase information _ which we gain by erasing .",
    "to re - express the quantum erasing procedure , similar to equation ( 4 ) , we search for a relationship between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "although the value of @xmath63 depends on @xmath14 and @xmath55 , our calculations show that the average of @xmath63 over @xmath14 does not depend on @xmath55 .",
    "for example , for an interaction with parameters @xmath33 and @xmath65 ( and @xmath66 ) , we have    @xmath67    this interesting result indicates that this measure can reflect ( in the average form ) the insignificance of the specific basis used for quantum erasing ; all matters is that the basis should be unbiased to @xmath47 .",
    "we could not , after all , find a meaningful relationship between @xmath68 and @xmath64 .",
    "but other ways exist to attack the problem .",
    "we consider that the phase guessing game is played for @xmath69 which maximizes @xmath50 .",
    "figure ( 3 ) shows that @xmath70 where @xmath71 equals one for any value of @xmath28  @xmath30 only plays role in determining @xmath69 .",
    "so we do erasing for a situation it is most needful .",
    "we naturally choose an erasing basis which helps more ( which minimizes @xmath72 ) .",
    "our calculations show that    @xmath73     equals one for any value of @xmath28 .",
    "additionally , the minimum ( over @xmath55 , the erasing bases ) of the conditional entropy of phase @xmath74 equals the conditional entropy of path @xmath75 for any value of @xmath28 . ]",
    "while @xmath33 and the only role played by parameter @xmath30 is in the determination of @xmath69 ( equation ( [ psit1 ] ) ) , figure ( 3 ) shows equation ( [ f1rel ] ) for an arbitrary value of @xmath28 .",
    "but it is not the desired relationship ; to achieve our goal , we should re - write it as    @xmath76    because @xmath77 and @xmath37 , we have    @xmath78    so    @xmath79    equation ( [ f2rel ] ) indicates that the amount of wavelike behavior which can be exhibited by quantum erasing equals the amount of particle - like behavior ( which will be sacrificed in the procedure ) . in other words , it indicates that the amount of which - phase information obtainable by quantum erasing equals the which - path information that is erased .",
    "now , it is time to get rid of the restriction @xmath33 . to find an arbitrary @xmath29 ,",
    "it is enough to rotate the bloch sphere about @xmath80 axis sufficiently .",
    "so the rotational invariance of the system can guarantee the validity of equation ( [ f2rel ] ) for arbitrary values of parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( an arbitrary interaction ) .",
    "equation ( [ f2rel ] ) holds for situations different from the one shown by figure ( 1 ) .",
    "if the two - level system @xmath17 interacts with the quanta in both arms , we can set the bloch sphere such that    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the initial state of @xmath17 .",
    "then , up to the global phase @xmath83 , every thing can proceed like the case of figure ( 1 ) .",
    "additionally , the entanglement between the quanta s path and a two - level system may be made by a mechanism different from an interaction inside the interferometer .    for a d - level ancillary system ,",
    "we write :    @xmath84    where @xmath82 is the initial state of the system .",
    "about the validity of equation ( [ f2rel ] ) for this situation , one may concern over the optimum projective measurement used in the path guessing game ( the projective measurement can have d possible outcomes ) and consequently , the erasing measurement in the phase guessing game . in the first game , we should discriminate between two pure states @xmath85 and @xmath86 prepared randomly .",
    "@xcite has introduced the characteristics of the projective measurement basis @xmath87 which maximizes @xmath88 ( minimizes @xmath89 )  here , @xmath40 can be a d - state random variable .",
    "first , `` two basis vectors ( say @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) lie in the plane spanned by the state vectors @xmath85 and @xmath86 '' and just these two outcomes are possible .",
    "second , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are symmetric to @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "so everything can proceed like before and equation ( [ f2rel ] ) is still valid .",
