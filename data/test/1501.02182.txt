    "we analyze the strength of weak measurements by addressing the question of quantum state discrimination .",
    "there are several known methods for quantum state discrimination , i.e. for the task of deciding which vector was chosen out of a predetermined set of ( possibly close ) state - vectors ( for a general review see @xcite ) .",
    "discriminating between predetermined non - orthogonal vectors can be seen as quantum hypothesis testing @xcite .",
    "suppose we use projective measurements , then the question is what are the best projections to choose so that the error probability would be as small as possible .",
    "this was first discussed by helstrom in @xcite for the case of two predetermined vectors .",
    "the density matrix version of the problem was developed by osaki in @xcite .",
    "a different scheme was presented by ivanovic @xcite where the discrimination is error free but there is a probability for obtaining a non - conclusive result , i.e. a ` do nt know ' result .",
    "a variant of this scheme was suggested in @xcite , @xcite where the inconclusive outcomes have a fixed rate .",

    "weak measurements were also proposed for the task of discrimination between two very close states @xcite .",
    "the scheme we suggest here in ch .",
    "ii is similar , yet somewhat more general , while the scheme we use at ch .",
    "i , based on an sequential weak measurements is quite different .",
    "the advantages and disadvantages of each method will be discussed .    in ch .",
    "i we discuss the orbit of a two dimensional state - vector under the set of transformations induced by weak measurements .",
    "this process can be described as a biased gaussian random walk on the unit circle .",
    "the probability amplitude that govern the next step ( the ` coin ' probability amplitude ) is changing with each step . in this , our walk is similar to the one presented in @xcite , but differs from the quantum random walk presented in @xcite .",
    "we thereby rotate two different vectors in opposite directions ( therefore in a non - unitary way ) , where we can use a single ( strong ) projective measurement to distinguish between them .",
    "we show that using enough weak measurements ( the number of which is a function of the weak coupling ) , the overall success probability converges to the known optimal result for discrimination by projective measurements @xcite .",
    "next we use a different approach ; we reduce the number of measurements , thus compromising the success probability , however , gaining an advantage by avoiding the collapse .    in ch .",
    "ii we apply the tsvf of weak measurements . by choosing the right hermitian operator and a proper post - selection we can get imaginary weak values .",
    "imaginary weak values are best suited for the analysis of the coordinate variable of the measurement space .",
    "we apply a non - linear expansion of the weak value and use it to compute the first and second moments of such a variable .",
    "these moments of the coordinate variable change as functions of the initial vector .",
    "we then pick two state vectors maximizing the difference between the two distributions of the coordinate variable .",

    "note that the collapse of the needle biases the system s vector .",
    "however , if @xmath44 is very large with respect to the difference between the eigenvalues of @xmath45 then the bias will be very small and the resulting system s vector will be very similar to the original vector .",

    "having started with @xmath12 , the error probability @xmath56 is :    @xmath57 @xmath58    the error probability for @xmath12 is the probability that the series of weak measurement iterations will take @xmath12 to @xmath18 and the strong measurement will take @xmath18 to @xmath3 , plus the probability that the weak process will take @xmath12 correctly to @xmath19 , but the strong measurement will take @xmath19 to @xmath3 . in the next simulation",

    "the solid curve describes the optimal success probability for projective measurements , @xmath64 .",
    "note that the success probabilities are with respect to different outcome vectors . ]",
    "the following conclusion is only natural :    * conclusion * @xmath65 .",
    "we can demonstrate the conjecture by extending the angle between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "hypothesis testing with weak measurements *    so far we have used the weak measurements to iteratively produce small biases of the initial vector to shift it towards one of the axes .",
    "the results we got for the pointer of the weak measurement apparatus were so far ignored .",
    "suppose now we use a very small number of weak measurements .",
    "we could use the pointers readings as samples from the vector s distribution .",
    "moreover , we can average over the few values and use the result as a statistic .",
    "notice however that we are sampling from a distribution that is changing following each pointer s reading .",
    "the advantage of such a protocol lies in the fact that the vector has not collapsed ; if the standard error of the weak measurement is large and the number of weak measurement is small then the resulting vector is still in the neighborhood of the original one .",
    "we will show that the distributions of the averages behaves as a function of the initial vector and therefore could be used to distinguish between the two .    in the next simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) we weakly measured the vectors for 5 , 10 , and 20 times , using @xmath66 .",
    "this simulation was performed 5000 times for several different angles @xmath7 ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is expected that the average value ( of weak measurements ) for @xmath12 ( resp .",
    "@xmath13 should be below 0 ( resp . above 0 ) .",
    "the success probability was computed by the number of times the average value did not cross 0 .",
    "[ fig6 ] describes the cumulative distribution function for the above average values ( denoted by @xmath67 ) for the initial angle @xmath68 and initial vector @xmath13 .",
    "it can be seen that the graphs are similar to a shifted cumulative distribution function of a normal random variable .",
    "moreover , the median is fixed regardless of the number of weak measurements .",
    "this median is supposed to coincide with the theoretical ` strong ' one when @xmath44 becomes lower .     and initial vector @xmath13 . ]    in practice , if we use such a protocol to distinguish between two vectors ( separated by an angle @xmath7 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) we should be aware of two types of errors .",
    "the first comes from the fact that the vector is changing with each weak measurement .",
    "it could possibly drift following the first measurement towards the other vector , thereafter staying in that neighborhood for long .",
    "thus our readings will identify the wrong vector .",
    "the second type of error comes from hypothesis testing",
    ". the sample of the average could be very close to 0 making the decision tougher .",
    "the simulation above does not distinguish between the two types of errors .",
    "it only matches the true vector with the average value of weak measurements , to give an overall success probability .",
    "in this chapter we will use the tsvf of weak measurements to perform a non - linear analysis of quantum state discrimination for a general coupling strength .",
    "we will show that for the rare events where the post - selection is successful we have a high probability to identify the vector .",
    "the motivation for utilizing post - selection was already verified in many precision measurements @xcite , hence it is natural to examine it for this application .    in the pre- and post - selected set of weak measurement ( see below ) we will look at the distribution of the pointer s coordinate variable @xmath69 .",
    "the moments of @xmath69 are functions of the pre - selected state @xmath70 , the post- selected state @xmath71 , and the operator @xmath72 .",
    "we will show that it is possible to pick two initial vectors @xmath73 such that the corresponding distributions of @xmath69 are easily distinguished ( possibly by one sample ) .",
    "in particular , for one of the initial vectors @xmath69 will be distributed around 0 with standard error @xmath44 while for the other initial vector @xmath69 will be distributed around @xmath44 with very low standard error ( almost 0 ) .",
    "this will make it easy to differentiate between the two cases .    in ii.1",
    "we compute the expansion of the weak value @xmath74 using all terms in @xmath75 and @xmath76 . in ii.2",
    "we show how to pick two initial vectors that maximizes the difference between the corresponding distributions of @xmath69 .",
    "our derivation is based on @xcite . + * ii.1 .",

    "let @xmath46 denote a state vector for that system .",
    "let @xmath77 .",
    "we will also assume @xmath78 , this will make it easy to write @xmath79 as a power series .",
    "assume also that :    @xmath80    let @xmath22 denote the wave function of a quantum measurement device .",
    "then ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the position operator of the measuring needle . we will also assume that @xmath25 is normally distributed around 0 with variance @xmath81 :    @xmath27    the function @xmath28 represents the device s ` needle ' amplitude distribution .",
    "we will now couple the principle system and the measurement system by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath32 :    @xmath82    ( we used the operator @xmath76 instead of @xmath29 since we need imaginary weak values @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath34 is a coupling function satisfying :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the coupling time .",
    "we shall start the measuring process with the vector :    @xmath31    in the tensor product of the two systems .",
    "then we apply the hamiltonian :    @xmath83    let    @xmath84    be the wave function of the needle following the coupling and the post - selection .",

    "now since the needle is symmetric ( normally distributed ) we can write :    @xmath100    hence    @xmath101    we shall now use the parametrization @xmath102 , ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) therefore :    @xmath105    since the needle is gaussian we can write    @xmath106    and    @xmath107    @xcite and therefore    @xmath108    the above ratio has maximal value at @xmath109 which is :    @xmath110    @xcite if the measurement is weak , i.e. @xmath111 , then    @xmath112    hence    @xmath113    this will be true for @xmath114 close to 0 . however , if @xmath115 then @xmath116 for all @xmath117 .    to sum - up @xmath118 is a function of two variables @xmath114 and @xmath119 .",
    "if the two variables are correlated such that @xmath120 then for @xmath119 small enough such that @xmath121 we can get @xmath118 to be very close to @xmath44 .",
    "but if we fix @xmath119 ( however small ) and let @xmath114 go to 0 we can decrease @xmath118 to 0 .",
    "the variable @xmath114 is a function of the weak values of @xmath75 .",
    "this means that we can tune @xmath114 such that for @xmath122 the expectation value @xmath123 will be close to @xmath44 , and for @xmath124 the expectation value @xmath125 will close to 0 .    to compute the variance of the needle after the post - selection note that : +   + @xmath126    @xmath127    since the needle is normally distributed it is easy to see that    @xmath128,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xcite and therefore @xmath129}{a^+ + a^-e^{-2(g\\sigma)^2}}\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for small enough @xmath130 the value of @xmath131 will be close to 1 and therefore @xmath132 will be close to @xmath81 .",
