    "access to large data sets on human activities and interactions has long been limited by the difficulty and cost of gathering such information . recently",
    ", the ever increasing availability of digital traces of human actions is widely enabling the representation and the analysis of massive amounts of information on human behavior .",
    "the representation of this information in terms of complex networks  @xcite has led to many research efforts because of the naturally interlinked nature of these new data sources .",
    "tracing human behavior in a variety of contexts has become possible at very different spatial and temporal scales : from mobility of individuals inside a city  @xcite and between cities  @xcite , to mobility and transportation in an entire country  @xcite , all the way to planetary - scale travel  @xcite .",
    "mobile devices such as cell phones make it possible to investigate mobility patterns and their predictability  @xcite . on - line interactions occurring between individuals can be monitored by logging instant messaging or email exchange  @xcite .",
    "recent technological advances further support mining real - world interactions by means of mobile devices and wearable sensors , opening up new avenues for gathering data on human and social interactions .",
    "bluetooth and wifi technologies give access to proximity patterns  @xcite , and even face - to - face presence can be resolved with high spatial and temporal resolution  @xcite .",
    "the combination of these technological advances and of heterogeneous data sources allow researchers to gather longitudinal data that have been traditionally scarce in social network analysis  @xcite .",
    "a dynamical perspective on interaction networks paves the way to investigating interesting problems such as the interplay of the network dynamics with dynamical processes taking place on these networks .    in this paper",
    ", we capitalize on recent efforts   @xcite that made possible to mine behavioral networks of face - to - face interactions between individuals , in a variety of real - world settings and in a time - resolved fashion .",
    "we present an in - depth analysis of the data we collected at two widely different events .",
    "the first event was the infectious exhibition  @xcite held at the science gallery in dublin , ireland , from april @xmath0 to july @xmath0 , 2009 .",
    "the second event was the acm hypertext 2009 conference  @xcite hosted by the institute for scientific interchange foundation in turin , italy , from june @xmath1 to july @xmath2 , 2009 . in the following",
    ", we will refer to these events as sg and ht09 , respectively .",
    "intuitively , interactions among conference participants differ from interactions among museum visitors , and the concerned individuals have very different goals in both settings .",
    "the study of the corresponding networks of proximity and interactions , both static and dynamic , reveals indeed strong differences but also interesting similarities .",
    "we take advantage of the availability of time - resolved data to show how dynamical processes that can unfold on the close proximity network  such as the propagation of a piece of information or the spreading of an infectious agent  unfold in very different ways in the investigated settings . in the epidemiological literature ,",
    "traditionally , processes of this kind have been studied using either aggregated data or under assumptions of stationarity for the interaction networks : here we leverage the time - resolved nature of our data to assess the role of network dynamics on the outcome of spreading processes . at a more fundamental level , simulating simple spreading processes over the recorded interaction networks allows us to expose several properties of their dynamical structure as well as to probe their causal structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we briefly describe the data collection platform and our data sets in section  [ data ] ; in section  [ static - properties ] we discuss the salient features of the networks of interactions aggregated on time windows of one day .",
    "these networks are static objects , carrying only information about the cumulative time that  daily  each pair of individuals has spent in face - to - face proximity .",
    "section  [ dynamic - properties ] analyzes the dynamical properties of face - to - face interactions between conference participants and museum visitors .",
    "section  [ resilience ] further characterizes the aggregated network structures by investigating the effect of incremental link removal .",
    "finally , section  [ information - diffusion ] investigates the role played by causality in information spreading along the proximity network , and section  [ conclusions ] concludes the paper and defines a number of open questions .",
    "the data collection infrastructure uses active radio - frequency identification devices ( rfid ) embedded in conference badges to mine face - to - face proximity relations of persons wearing the badges .",
    "rfid devices exchange ultra - low power radio packets in a peer - to - peer fashion , as described in refs .",
    "exchange of radio packets between badges is only possible when two persons are at close range ( @xmath3 to @xmath4 m ) and facing each other , as the human body acts as a rf shield at the carrier frequency used for communication .",
    "the operating parameters of the devices are programmed so that the face - to - face proximity of two individuals wearing the rfid tags can be assessed with a probability in excess of @xmath5 over an interval of @xmath6 seconds , which is a fine enough time scale to resolve human mobility and proximity at social gatherings .",
    "false positives are exceedingly unlikely , as the ultra - low power radio packets used for proximity sensing can not propagate farther than @xmath4-@xmath7 m , and a sustained excess of packets is needed in order to signal a proximity event .",
    "when a relation of face - to - face proximity ( or `` contact '' , as we will refer to it in the following ) is detected , the rfid devices report this information to receivers installed in the environment ( rfid readers ) .",
    "the readers are connected to a central computer system by means of a local area network .",
    "once a contact has been established , it is considered ongoing as long as the involved devices continue to exchange at least one radio packet for every subsequent interval of @xmath6 seconds .",
    "conversely , a contact is considered terminated if an interval of @xmath6 seconds elapses with no packets exchanged . for a detailed description of the sensing platform and",
    "some of its deployments , see refs.@xcite .",
    "the deployments at the science gallery in dublin  @xcite and at the ht09 conference in turin  @xcite involved vastly different numbers of individuals and stretched along different time scales .",
    "the former lasted for about three months and recorded the interactions of more than @xmath8 visitors ( more than @xmath9 face - to - face contacts recorded ) , whereas the latter took place over the course of three days and involved about @xmath10 conference participants ( about @xmath11 contacts ) .",
    "behaviors are also very different : in a museum , visitors typically spend a limited amount of time on site , well below the maximum duration permitted by the museum opening hours , they are not likely to return , and they follow a rather pre - defined path , touching different locations that host the exhibits . in a conference setting , on the other hand , most attendees stay on - site for the entire duration of the conference ( a few days ) , and move at will between different areas such as conference room , areas for coffee breaks and so on .",
    "the coverage of the community was different in both settings . at the science gallery",
    ", visitors were equipped with a rfid tag upon entering the venue , as part of an interactive exhibit , and therefore almost the totality of them were tracked .",
    "on the other hand , at ht09 , about 75% of the participants volunteered to being tracked .",
    "this sampling may introduce some biases in the results .",
    "sampling issues are also commonly encountered in the study of static complex networks @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite has shown that for a broad variety of real - world deployments of the rfid proximity - sensing platform used in this study , the behavior of the statistical distributions of quantities such as contact durations is not altered by unbiased sampling of individuals . on the other hand , we can not completely rule out that a systematic bias is introduced by the selection of volunteers , if volunteers and non - volunteers have different behavioral patterns . accurately checking",
    "this point would require monitoring an independent data source for face - to - face contacts , and because of scalability issues this would be feasible only for small control groups .",
    "issues regarding the effect of missing data and incomplete sampling on the properties of dynamical processes unfolding on the networks also deserve attention and will be the subject of future investigations .",
    "we start by analyzing aggregated networks of interaction obtained by aggregating the raw proximity data over one day .",
    "this aggregation yields a social graph where nodes represent individuals , and an edge is drawn between two nodes if at least one contact was detected between those nodes during the interval of aggregation .",
    "therefore , every edge is naturally weighted by the total duration of the contact events that occurred between the tags involved , i.e. , by the total time during which the corresponding individuals have been in face - to - face proximity .",
    "the choice of daily time windows seems quite natural in our settings .",
    "it would represent , for instance , a typical time scale for a description of articulated social networks based on surveys , in which each participant would ( ideally ) declare who s / he has encountered during the course of the day .",
    "such a choice for the duration of the time - window , albeit natural , is by no means unique  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is possible to aggregate the data over longer periods of time ( weeks or months ) to investigate the stationarity of the collected data  @xcite .",
    "shorter aggregation times of the order of a few minutes are also useful , for instance , to resolve circadian activity patterns at the venue under investigation .",
    "figure  [ aggregated - networks ] displays the aggregated contact networks for june 30@xmath12 at the ht09 conference ( top left ) , and for three representative days for the sg museum deployment . despite the large variation in the number of daily museum visitors , ranging from about @xmath13 to @xmath14 ,",
    "the chosen days illustrate many features of the sg aggregated networks , in particular the presence of either a single or two large connected components ( cc ) in the network .",
    "days with smaller numbers of visitors can also give rise to aggregated networks made of a larger number of small isolated clusters .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ nclusters ] , depending on the number of visitors the number of cc can in fact vary substantially . for a large number of visitors ,",
    "typically only one cc is observed . for a low number of visitors ,",
    "on the other hand , many clusters are formed .",
    "overall one also notices that the network diameter ( highlighted in all the plots of fig .  [ aggregated - networks ] ) is considerably longer for sg than for ht09 aggregated networks , reflecting the different behavioral patterns in these settings .",
    "the small - world nature  or lack thereof  of the aggregated networks can be investigated statistically by introducing a proper null model . to this end",
    ", we construct a randomized network using the rewiring procedure described in ref .",
    "the procedure consists in taking random pairs of links @xmath15 and @xmath16 involving @xmath17 distinct nodes , and rewiring them as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this procedure preserves the degree of each node and the degree distribution @xmath20 , while destroying the degree correlations between neighboring nodes , as well as any other correlations linked to node properties .",
    "the procedure is carried out so that initially distinct ccs do not get merged .",
    "since the rewiring procedure can not be implemented for the rare ccs with less than four nodes , these small ccs are removed from the aggregated networks before rewiring .",
    "figure  [ rewired - networks ] displays a single realization of the null model for the networks in the top row of fig .",
    "[ aggregated - networks ] .",
    "we notice that the rewired version of the aggregated ht09 network is very similar to the original version , whereas the null model for the aggregated network of the sg data on july 14@xmath12 is more `` compact '' than the original network and exhibits a much shorter diameter .",
    "similar considerations hold for the other aggregated networks of the sg deployment .    .",

    "the saturation value @xmath26 is reached when @xmath21 is equal to the length of the network diameter , and may vary for different realizations of the random networks . for a network consisting of several ccs one has to take into account the probability @xmath28 that the chosen node belongs to a given cc , where @xmath29 is the number of nodes in the @xmath30-th cc . as a consequence , eq .",

    ", we left out the few isolated nodes that contribute to the degree distribution for @xmath37 only .",
    "the @xmath20 distributions are short - tailed in all cases : @xmath20 decreases exponentially in the sg case , and even faster for ht09 .",
    "we notice that the ht09 degree distribution exhibits a peak at @xmath36 around @xmath38 , pointing to a characteristic number of contacts established during the conference",
    ". moreover , the average degree in the ht09 case , @xmath39 , close to @xmath6 , is more than twice as high as that for the sg networks , @xmath40 which is close to @xmath41 .",
    "this represents another clear indication of the behavioral difference of conference participants versus museum visitors ( the fact that the average degree is high for conference attendees can be regarded as a goal of the conference itself ) .",
    "finally , we observe that a large fraction of the recorded contacts are sustained for a short time : for instance , removing all the contacts with a cumulated duration below one minute yields @xmath40 about @xmath42 for ht09 and @xmath40 about @xmath43 for sg .",
    "the availability of time - resolved data allows one to gain much more insight into the salient features of the social interactions taking place during the deployments than what could be possible by the only knowledge of `` who has been in face - to - face proximity of whom '' .",
    "we first investigated the presence duration distribution in both settings .",
    "for the conference case , the distribution is rather trivial , as it essentially counts the number of conference participants spending one , two or three days at the conference .",
    "the visit duration distribution for the museum , instead , can be fitted to a lognormal distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ p - visits ] ) , with geometric mean around @xmath44 minutes .",
    "this shows that , unlike the case of the conference , here one can meaningfully introduce the concept of a characteristic visit duration that turns out to be well below the cutoff imposed by museum opening hours .",
    "the existence of a characteristic visit duration sheds light on the elongated aspect of the aggregated networks of visitor interactions ( see fig .",
    "[ aggregated - networks ] ) .",
    "indeed museum visitors are unlikely to interact directly with other visitors entering the venue more than one hour after them , thus preventing the aggregated network from exhibiting small - world properties .",
    "figure  [ node - color - code ] reports the sg aggregated networks for two different days , where the network diameter is highlighted and each node is colored according to the arrival time of the corresponding visitor .",
    "one notices that , as expected from the aforementioned properties of the visit duration distribution , there is limited interaction among visitors entering the museum at different times .",
    "furthermore , the network diameter clearly defines a path connecting visitors that enter the venue at subsequent times , mirroring the longitudinal dimension of the network .",
    "these findings show that aggregated network topology and longitudinal / temporal properties are deeply interwoven .",
    "let us now focus on the temporal properties of social interactions .",
    "at the most detailed level , each contact between two individuals is characterized by its duration .",
    "the corresponding distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ p - contact ] .",
    "as noted before , in both the ht09 and sg cases most of the recorded interactions amount to shortly - sustained contacts lasting less than one minute .",
    "however , both distributions show broad tails  they decay only slightly faster than a power law",
    ". this behavior does not come as a surprise , as it has been observed in social sciences in a variety of context ranging from human mobility to email or mobile phone calls networks @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the distributions are very close ( except in the noisy tail , due to the different number of contributing events ) , showing that the statistics of contact durations are robust across two very different settings .",
    "this robustness has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite across different scientific conferences , but the museum setting corresponds to a situation in which a flux of individuals follows a predefined path , and this strong similarity between distributions was therefore not expected a priori . at a coarser level ,",
    "aggregated networks are characterized by weights on the links , that quantify for how long two individuals have been in face - to - face proximity during the aggregation interval .",
    "figure  [ p - w ] displays the distributions of these weights @xmath45 .",
    "these distributions are very broad  @xcite : while most links correspond to very short contacts , some correspond to very long cumulated durations , and all time scales are represented , that is , no characteristic interaction timescale ( except for obvious cutoffs ) can be determined .",
    "we note that at this coarser level of analysis the distributions are again very similar .             in the ht09 ( left ) and sg ( right ) aggregated networks ( data for all daily networks ) .",

    "have been observed in various contexts  @xcite .",
    "a super - linear dependence such as the one observed in some conference settings  @xcite hints at the presence of super - spreader nodes that play a prominent role in processes such as information diffusion  @xcite . on the other hand , the sub - linear dependence observed for large - scale phone call networks  @xcite corresponds to the fact that more active individuals spend on average less time in each call .",
    "figure [ s - over - k ] displays the ratio @xmath54 for the sg and ht09 daily aggregated networks .",
    "two different trends appear despite the large fluctuations : a slightly increasing trend in the conference setting , and a clearly decreasing one in the museum setting .",
    "in particular , the behavior of @xmath55 for the ht09 case ( left plot in figure [ s - over - k ] ) can be fitted linearly yielding a linear coefficient @xmath56 ( p - value @xmath57 ) . by reshuffling @xmath58 times the weights of the network links and performing the same linear fit for each reshuffling",
    ", we obtain a distribution of linear coefficients @xmath47 . such distribution ,",
    "whose mean is zero , is shown in the inset of the left plot in figure [ s - over - k ] together with the value of @xmath47 from the ht09 daily aggregated networks ( vertical line ) .",
    "the observed value of @xmath47 at the ht09 is an outlier of the distribution ( @xmath59 percentile ) , thus showing that the observed behavior of @xmath55 can hardly arise by a random assignment of link weights . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed behavior of @xmath55 at the sg can be fitted to a power law with a negative exponent",
    "i.e. it decreases linearly on a double logarithmic scale such as the one shown in the inset of the right plot in figure [ s - over - k ] .",
    "these results indicate that individuals who encountered the same number of distinct persons can have different spreading potentials , depending on the setting .",
    "it also gives a warning about characterizing spreading by only measuring the number of encounters , which can yield a rather misleading view .",
    "the issue of network vulnerability to successive node removal has attracted a lot of interest in recent years starting from the pioneering works of refs .",
    "@xcite , that have shown how complex networks typically retain their integrity when nodes are removed randomly , while they are very fragile with respect to targeted removal of the most connected nodes . while the concepts of node failures and targeted attacks are pertinent for infrastructure networks , successive removals of nodes or links is more generally a way to study network structures  @xcite .",
    "for instance , detecting efficient strategies for dismantling the network sheds light on the network community structure , as it amounts to finding the links that act as bridges between different communities  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the context of information or disease spreading , the size of the largest connected component gives an upper bound on the number of nodes affected by the spreading . identifying ways to reduce this size , by removing particular links , in order to break and disconnect the network as much as possible , is analogous in terms of disease spreading to finding efficient intervention and containment strategies .    in order to test different link removal strategies , we consider different definitions of weight for a link connecting nodes @xmath30 and @xmath60 in the aggregated contact network : +  the simplest definition of link weight",
    "is given by the cumulated contact duration @xmath61 between @xmath30 and @xmath60 . in the following",
    ", we will refer to this weight as `` contact weight '' .",

    "@xcite , is defined as @xmath63 \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the degree of node @xmath65 and @xmath66 measures the number of neighbors shared by nodes @xmath30 and @xmath60 .",
    "this measure is reminiscent of the edge clustering coefficient  @xcite , and evaluates the ratio of the number of triangles leaning upon the @xmath67 edge with the maximum possible number of such triangles given that @xmath30 and @xmath60 have degrees @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "edges between different communities are expected to have a low number of common neighbors , hence a low value of @xmath62 .",
    "+  finally ,",
    "the structural similarity of two nodes is defined as the cosine similarity @xmath70 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the set of neighbors shared by nodes @xmath30 and @xmath60 , and the sums at the denominator are computed over all the neighbors of @xmath30 and @xmath60 .",
    "cosine similarity , which is one of the simplest similarity measures used in the field of information retrieval  @xcite , takes into account not only the number of shared neighbors of @xmath30 and @xmath60 , but also the similarity of the corresponding edge strengths , i.e. the similarity of individuals in terms of the time they spent with their neighbors .",
    "once again , edges connecting different communities are expected to have a low value of @xmath72 .",
    "based on these three weight definitions , we consider four different strategies for link removal , namely : removing the links in increasing / decreasing order of contact weight , in increasing order of topological overlap , and in increasing order of cosine similarity .",
    "the former two strategies are the simplest one can devise , as they do not consider the neighborhoods topology .",
    "the latter two strategies were implemented in an incremental fashion , by recomputing the lists of links ranked in order of increasing overlap or cosine similarity whenever a link was removed , and then removing the links in the updated list order ) and ( [ eq : cos - simil ] ) , leads to sub - optimal results .",
    "the deviation from the updating strategy becomes apparent only when more than @xmath73 of links have been removed since @xmath62 and @xmath72 deal with local quantities only . as a consequence ,",
    "each link removal amounts to a local perturbation of the network , contrary to what happens with non - local quantities such as the betweenness centrality  @xcite . ] .",
    "an issue also arises from the fact that all the generalized weights mentioned above produce a certain amount of link degeneracy ( in particular when using the contact weight ) : for instance , many links may have the same ( small ) value @xmath61 , or exactly @xmath74 overlap or similarity .",

    "we will mainly use an epidemiological terminology , but we may equally imagine that the rfid devices are able to exchange some information whenever a contact is established .",
    "individuals will be divided into two categories , susceptible individuals ( s ) or infected ones ( i ) : susceptible individuals have not caught the `` disease '' ( or have not received the information ) , while infected ones carry the disease ( or have received the information ) and can propagate it to other individuals .    in order to focus on the structure of the dynamical network itself , we consider in the following a deterministic snowball si model  @xcite : every contact between a susceptible individual and an infected one , no matter how short , results in a transmission event in which the susceptible becomes infected , according to @xmath90 . in this model , individuals ,",

    "such a deterministic model allows to isolate the role played in the spreading process by the structure of the dynamical network ( e.g. its causality ) .",

    "of course , any realistic epidemiological model should include a stochastic description of the infection process , since the transmission from an infected individual to a susceptible one is a random event that depends on their cumulative interaction time .",

    "we assessed the role of network dynamics on the outcome of dynamical processes such as spreading processes of informations or of an infectious agent .",

    "the networks differences are also unveiled by a percolation analysis , which reveals how the sg aggregated networks can easily be dismantled by removing links that act as `` bridges '' between groups of individuals ; on the contrary , aggregated networks at a conference are more `` robust '' , even with respect to targeted link removal .",
    "interestingly , some important similarities are also observed : the degree distributions of aggregated networks , for example , are short - tailed in both cases . moreover , despite the higher social activity at a conference , both the distribution of the contact event durations and the distribution of the total time spent in face - to - face interactions by two individuals are very similar .",
    "the study of simple spreading processes unfolding on the dynamical networks of interaction between individuals allowed us to delve deeper into the time - resolved nature of our data .",
    "comparison of the spreading dynamics on the time - dependent networks with the corresponding dynamics on the aggregated networks shows that the latter easily yields erroneous conclusions .",

    "the temporal properties of the contacts are crucial in determining the spreading patterns and their properties .",
    "studies about the role of the initial seed and its properties on the spreading patterns , or the determination of the most crucial nodes for propagation , can be misleading if only the static aggregated network is considered . in more realistic dynamics , the fastest path is typically not the shortest path of the aggregated network , and the role of causality is clearly visible in the analysis of the seed - to - last - infected paths .",
    "spreading phenomena unfold in very different ways in the two settings we investigated : at a conference , people interact repeatedly and with bursts of activity , so that transmission events also occur in a bursty fashion , and most individuals are reached at the end of the day ; in a streaming situation , instead , the fraction of reached individuals can be very small due to either the lack of global connectivity or the late start of the spreading process .",
    "detailed information on the temporal ordering of contacts is therefore crucial .",
    "we also note that in more realistic settings with non - deterministic spreading , information about the duration of contacts , and not only their temporal ordering , would also turn out to be very relevant and lead to an interesting interplay between the contact timescale and the propagation timescale  @xcite .",
    "future work will also address the issue of sampling effects : the fact that not all the conference attendees participated to the data collection may lead to an underestimation of spreading , since spreading paths between sampled attendees involving unobserved persons may have existed , but are not taken into account .",
    "we close by stressing that as the data sources on person - to - person interactions become richer and ever more pervasive , the task of analyzing networks of interactions is unavoidably shifting away from statics towards dynamics , and a pressing need is building up for theoretical frameworks that can appropriately deal with streamed graph data and large scales .",
    "at the same time , we have shown that access to these data sources challenges a number of assumptions and poses new questions on how well - known dynamical processes unfold on dynamic graphs .",

    "<S> we compare two settings with very different properties , a scientific conference and a long - running museum exhibition . </S>",
    "<S> we track the behavioral networks of face - to - face proximity , and characterize them from both a static and a dynamic point of view , exposing differences and similarities . </S>",
    "<S> we use our data to investigate the dynamics of a susceptible - infected model for epidemic spreading that unfolds on the dynamical networks of human proximity . </S>",
    "<S> the spreading patterns are markedly different for the conference and the museum case , and they are strongly impacted by the causal structure of the network data . a deeper study of the spreading paths shows that the mere knowledge of static aggregated networks would lead to erroneous conclusions about the transmission paths on the dynamical networks . </S>"
