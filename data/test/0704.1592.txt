    "in the quiet regions of the solar surface the magnetic field is mainly concentrated at the boundaries of the network cells . over the past decade , apart from the well - known mottles and spicules , several other structures residing at the network boundaries such as explosive events , blinkers , network flares , upflow events have been mentioned in the literature .",
    "however , their interpretation , inter - relationship and their relation to the underlying photospheric magnetic concentrations remain ambiguous , because the same feature has a different appearance when observed in different spectral lines and by different instruments . for most of the events mentioned above magnetic reconnection",
    "is suggested as the driving mechanism .",
    "this is not surprising , since it is now well established from investigations of high resolution magnetograms , that new bipolar elements emerge continuously inside the cell interiors and are , subsequently , swept at the network boundaries by the supergranular flow ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "interactions of the magnetic fields have as a result either the enhancement of the flux concentration in the case of same polarities or its cancellation in the case of opposite polarities .",
    "observations support the idea that flux cancellation most likely invokes magnetic reconnection . in this context , the study and comprehension of the dynamical behaviour of the different fine - scale structures is crucial to the understanding of the dynamics of the solar atmosphere .    in this work we present observations of a solar quiet region and some of the properties of several different structures appearing at the network boundaries and observed in different wavelengths by the different instruments involved in a coordinated campaign .",

    "in october 2005 we ran a 12 days observational campaign .",
    "the aim of that campaign was the collection of multi - wavelength observations both from the ground and space that could be used for the study of the dynamical behaviour of mottles / spicules and other fine structures , observed in different layers of the solar atmosphere .",
    "three ground - based telescopes were involved in that campaign : dot on la palma , themis on tenerife and solis at kitt peak . from space telescopes two spacecraft were involved : soho ( with cds , sumer , and mdi ) and trace .",
    "the analysed data were obtained on october 14 and consist of time sequences of observations of a quiet region found at the solar disk center recorded by different instruments .",
    "sequences recorded by the dot were obtained between 10:15:43 ",

    "were corrected for flat field , cosmic rays and other instrumental effects . a single gaussian with a linear background and poisson statistics were used for fitting each spectral line profile .",

    "dot s field - of - view ( fov ) is 80  in the @xmath5 direction and 63  in the @xmath6 direction . for the present study we selected a smaller region which contains a rosette with several mottles pointing to a common center ( see fig .",

    "these seem to be passively advected with the general granular flow field in the intergranular lanes .",
    "while we have not conducted an exhaustive study of bright point lifetimes we find that bright points can be visible from some minutes up to almost the entire length of the time series . in the contemporal caiih images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dotimage ] , _ right , first row _ bright points are less sharp due to strong scattering in this line and possibly due to increasing flux tube with height .",

    "some mottle endings appear extra dark in the blue wing image through doppler blueshift . near the mottle endings one can see bright points .",
    "these are sharper in the g - band but stand out much clearer in the h@xmath0  wing .",
    "thus h@xmath0  wing represents a promising proxy magnetometer to locate and track isolated intermittent magnetic elements .",
    "this is because the h@xmath0wing has a strong photospheric contribution , as it is shown by @xcite who arrived to this conclusion by using radiative transfer calculations and convective simulations . in the h@xmath8  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dotimage ] , _ left , second row _ ) dark streaks around the rosette s center are signatures of redshifts .",

    "_ right _ : the velocity at h@xmath7.,width=434 ]    an important parameter for the study of the dynamics of mottles is their velocity . for its determination , when filtergrams at two wavelengths of equal intensity at the blue and the red side of the line are available , a technique based on the subtraction of images can be used . in this technique , by using the well known representation of the line intensity profile and assuming a gaussian wavelength dependence of the optical thickness , we can define the parameter ds :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the reference profile emitted by the background .",
    "ds is called doppler signal , has the same sign as the velocity and can be used for a qualitative description of the velocity field ( for a description of the method see @xcite ) . when an optical depth less than one is assumed then quantitative values of the velocity can be obtained from the relation :    @xmath13    since in that case the velocity depends only on ds ( obtained from the observations ) and the doppler width , @xmath14 ( obtained from the literature ) . by using these relations",
    "we have constructed 2-d intensity and velocity images for the whole time series .",
    "we found out that it is difficult to follow each one mottle for more than two or three frames and that the general appearance of the region seems to change quite rapidly with time .",
    "for a quantitative estimate of the temporal changes we computed the value of the cross correlation ( cc ) function over the 2-d fov both for the intensity and velocity .",

    "the e - folding time for the left curve is found equal to 2min , the middle curve equal to 5min and the right curve is of the order of the cadence .",
