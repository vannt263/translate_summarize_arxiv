    "the characterization of the orbits supported by an astrophysical potential is of interest in order to study self - consistent models of stellar systems .",
    "@xcite , for example , pioneered the construction of steady state distribution functions from a well chosen set of regular orbits belonging to a given potential ; other studies followed on the same line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it was established that regular orbits act as a dynamical skeleton of a stellar system . moreover , among regular orbits , those that are resonant and stable are of utmost importance , since they generate entire families of orbits around them : they constitute the backbone of the system . on the other hand , chaotic orbits ,",
    "the existence of which in realistic models of galaxies is nowadays beyond doubt @xcite , are important to the dynamical evolution of stellar systems . in particular , the slow difusion of many chaotic orbits through their allowed phase space may affect even the global characteristics of the system .",
    "as @xcite and @xcite showed , the spatial distribution of fully chaotic orbits ( i.e. , those which obey only one isolating integral of the motion ) and partially chaotic orbits ( those which obey two integrals ) is quite different .",
    "this points towards a different dynamical role for each type of chaoticity , although what kind of role is still unknown .",
    "thus , finding regular , resonant , non resonant , partially chaotic and fully chaotic orbits is fundamental in the study of the dynamics of a stellar system .",
    "they all are defined by the number of isolating integrals of motion that they obey . for an @xmath0-dimensional potential , regular orbits have @xmath0 or more isolating integrals , whereas chaotic orbits obey less than @xmath0 isolating integrals or more isolating integrals of motion .",
    "however , a chaotic orbit is defined through its sensitivity to the initial conditions in phase space : if the initial conditions of the orbit are infinitesimally displaced , the distance between the original orbit and the new orbit grows exponentially with time .",
    "these definitions do not complement each other . whereas it can be proved that a regular orbit is not chaotic and a chaotic orbit is not regular ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has not been proved that every irregular ( i.e. not regular ) orbit is chaotic , or , in other words , that every orbit obeying less than @xmath0 isolating integrals has sensitivity to the initial conditions . nevertheless , to avoid confusion",
    ", we will follow here the widespread convention of considering irregular orbits and chaotic orbits as the same set . ] . among regular orbits , those that are not resonant obey exactly @xmath0 isolating integrals , whereas those resonant have one more isolating integral for each additional resonance . on the other hand , among chaotic orbits ,",
    "fully and partially chaotic orbits are also distinguished by the number of isolating integrals they have , as said above .",
    "thus , a method allowing to determine the number of isolating integrals an orbit obey is a fundamental tool in studying the dynamics of a stellar system .",
    "one of the main consequences of obeying isolating integrals of motion is the dimension of the manifold on which the orbit moves . since an isolating integral is , by definition , a non - degenerate , time independent funcion of the phase space coordinates the value of which is constant along the orbit , it reduces in one the dimension of the manifold in which the orbit moves @xcite .",
    "thus , if @xmath1 is the dimension of the phase space , an orbit obeying @xmath2 isolating integrals moves in a manifold of dimension @xmath3 .",
    "one can then ascertain the number of integrals that an orbit obeys by computing the dimension of the space in which it moves . to be brief , we will refer hereafter to isolating integrals as simply integrals , and to the dimension of the manifold on which an orbit moves as the dimension of an orbit.    the traditional methods to compute the dimension of an orbit or the number of its integrals are : a ) surfaces of section ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as is well known , this method needs a qualitative judgment on a plot , and can not distinguish between orbits moving in 3 o more dimensions .",
    "b ) lyapunov exponents ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this method is the standard tool to separate regular from chaotic orbits ; it is quite reliable , and can in principle recognize the dimension of chaotic orbits . on the negative side , since one needs both to integrate a set of variational equations and to integrate along large intervals in order to approximate @xmath4 , it is quite expensive in terms of computing time , and , furthermore , it can not recognize the dimension of regular orbits .",
    "c ) spectral dynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "taking into account that a regular orbit on an @xmath0-dimensional potential moves on a manifold diffeomorphic to a @xmath0-dimensional torus @xcite , the natural frequencies of revolution around the @xmath0 independent circles of the torus must be reflected in the fourier spectra of the orbit .",
    "this allows to find whether there are resonances , and thus the dimension of the orbit can be established .",
    "unfortunately , the method is not suitable for analizing rotating potentials , requires a fine tuning of a set of numerical parameters for each different potential , and can not find the dimension of chaotic orbits .",
    "the frequency map method @xcite is based on the same idea .",
    "d ) the smaller alignment index , or sali ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and its generalization , the generalized alignment index , or gali ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "both methods are based in a geometrical property of phase space vectors joining close initial conditions , namely that they align themselves or not depending on the geometrical properties of the local dynamics of the system , allowing a fast and accurate determination of whether an orbit is regular or chaotic .",
    "the gali , in particular , although can not retrieve the dimension of a chaotic orbir , do allow to discern the dimension of the torus of regular orbits , making it an excellent gauge to our results .    @xcite have proposed a method to find the dimension of ( the attractor of ) an orbit in an arbitrary dynamical system , the equations of motion of which are unknown , based on the computation of the correlation integral of the time series of an arbitrary observable . in this context",
    ", several improvements have been made to the method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and many caveats and spurious estimations have been found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "also , some implementations have been made in the astronomical field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the application of the method to find the dimension of an orbit integrated in an astronomical potential , i.e. , knowing the equations of motion and being able to sample the actual trajectory of the system at arbitrary points , was first proposed by @xcite , and more recently by @xcite .",
    "the rationale is as follows .",
    "suppose that a given orbit obeys @xmath5 isolating integrals , i.e. , it is closed and therefore unidimensional .",
    "given a small hypersphere ( in phase space ) of radius @xmath6 around a point @xmath7 of this orbit , the number of other points of the orbit included into the sphere will grow linearly as @xmath6 grows .",
    "if the orbit obeyed @xmath8 integrals , moving in a bidimensional surface , the number of points would grow as @xmath9 as @xmath6 grows . from this point on , it is clear that if the orbit is moving on a @xmath10-dimensional space , the number of points would grow as @xmath11 as @xmath6 grows .",
    "this simple mechanism , in principle , allows to easily compute the dimension of the orbit and , therefore , the number of integrals of motion it obeys .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have developed a simple algorithm in order to compute the dimension @xmath10 of an orbit following the foregoing idea .",
    "given a set of phase space points of the orbit , first compute the distances between pairs of them .",
    "second , compute the cumulative distribution function of those distances .",
    "this is nothing but the correlation integral @xmath12 of the points of the orbit , i.e. , an histogram of the number of pairs of points separated by a given distance or less",
    ". this function must be precisely equal to @xmath11 , i.e. , the number of pairs closer than a given distance must grow as @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , from a log  log plot of @xmath12 , a straight line can be fitted , its slope giving the desired exponent @xmath10 which is the dimension sought .",
    "a few caveats are in order : a ) the exponent @xmath10 is theoretically obtained only in the limit @xmath13 ; thus , the slope must be computed avoiding large values of @xmath6 .",
    "b ) unfortunately , since the volume of phase space is proportional to @xmath14 , there will be always few points in the region @xmath15 , so this region of @xmath12 will be noisy in general , and therefore must be also avoided in computing @xmath10 .",
    "c ) in order to avoid autocorrelations , the points of the orbit should not be too close in time ; otherwise , @xmath12 will tend to yield @xmath16 at short distances ( see  [ timestep ] ) .",
    "therefore , in order to build up the histogram , the distances should be computed only between a random subsample of the integrated points .",
    "of course , the number of points @xmath17 of the orbit must be sufficient so as to get a reasonable good computation of @xmath12 .",
    "as described , the method is very simple indeed . @xcite and @xcite give several examples of its application to orbits supported by different astronomical potentials , and the results seem encouraging .",
    "however , in order to compete against other methods , the algorithm must be capable of classify orbits blindly ; otherwise , it would be not better than inspecting surfaces of section .",
    "to see whether it is the case , we choose a stckel potential , for it has all its orbits regular ( i.e. , they all must have @xmath18 , with the possible exception of a few orbits with @xmath19 ) , and therefore we know the correct outcome beforehand , allowing us to assess immediately how good is the method , at least in this particular case .",
    "thus , we integrated 5487 orbits in the potential generated by the perfect ellipsoid density distribution @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are constants @xcite .",
    "we used @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the orbits were integrated along 500 periods with a time step of 1/200 of the respective orbital period , so as to get 100,000 points for each orbit .",
    "the dimensions @xmath10 were computed using the distances of a random sample of 10,000 of those points .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ dstackel ] , where it can be seen a wide dispersion of values instead of the unique expected value @xmath18 . in order to verify whether the number of points @xmath17 was inadequate @xcite",
    ", we took the 520 orbits that lie to the left of @xmath28 , and integrated them along 5000 periods , effectively increasing both the number of orbital points and the number of sample points by ten .",
    "the result is showed in fig .",
    "[ dstackel2 ] , where it can be seen again that the orbits do not pile up around @xmath18 .",
    "this result , besides showing that a nave implementation of the method does not yield good results , highlights another point : a non - integer value of @xmath10 does not necessarily denote a fractal dimension @xcite , but may indicate a poor computation of the true dimension .",
    "it is clear that a careful numerical implementation of the method is essential to get acceptable results .",
    "we have identified several parameters that affect the outcome . to illustrate the analysis , we will use , in the following , two orbits integrated in the stckel potential generated by the perfect ellipsoid density distribution ( eq . [ [ densidad ] ] ) .",
    "table [ tabla1 ] shows the respective initial conditions .",
    "the first orbit is a box orbit ; the second one is a @xmath29tube orbit ; both orbits move in a manifold of dimension @xmath18 .",
    "also , in all cases the function @xmath12 has been normalized to its maximum value , that is , @xmath30 at large distances .",
    ".initial conditions of the example orbits .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     therefore , we turn to a visual inspection of some of these orbits .",
    "although we found , as was the case with the chaotic orbits , that there were a few orbits misclassified by the correlation integral that were correctly classified by the spectral dynamics , we found that most of them seemed to have the dimension given by the correlation integral .",
    "when examining their fourier spectra to find out why the spectral dynamics method assigned these orbits a wrong dimension , we found that those spectra had close lines , which is the single most important numerical problem of the spectral dynamics .",
    "we have analized a method to find the dimension of the manifold on which an orbit moves , dubbed the correlation integral .",
    "this amounts to find out how many isolating integrals of motion the orbit has . in turn",
    ", this last number allows to classify the orbit as regular or chaotic , and , among these two categories , whether it is closed or resonant , of whether it is partially or fully chaotic .",
    "the method turns out to be easy to implement , but it depends on a number of numerical parameters which have to be chosen with some care in order to obtain good results .",
    "we have analized the most important parameters , finding the numerical values that allow the method to be reliable .",
    "the method was applied to orbits integrated in a stckel potential , obtaining that most of them move in a manifold of dimension 3 , as expected . however , a few orbits with computed dimensions below 3 can be well classified provided that they are integrated during longer times , as is the case of the computation of chaoticity by means of lyapunov exponents .",
    "the method was also applied to a number of other potentials previously studied in the literature , and compared against other gauges of chaoticity and/or regularity ( lyapunov exponents , sali / gali and spectral dynamics ) , giving in general satisfactory results .",
    "detailed analyses of the orbits that were variously classified by the different methods showed a limitation of the correlation integral , in particular to cope with near closed orbits , for which @xmath16 is obtained instead of the correct @xmath19 , and sticky orbits , which are already difficult to cope with for any algorithm intending to classify them .",
    "as said before , these results expose the need of combininig information from several techniques before a conclusive answer could be given for any particular orbit . for chaotic orbits ,",
    "in particular , it was found that the lyapunov exponents may not give the true dimension of the manifold on which the orbit moves .",
    "the fact that the exponential divergence may not be a direct measure of the dimension of the manifold of the trajectory was already proved for maps ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the experiments described here show that this may be true also for continuous differential equations .    a fortran 77 program that computes the correlation integral is freely available upon request .",
