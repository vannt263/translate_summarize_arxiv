    "the diffusion of particles in a narrow channel is a subject that has brought attention in the last decade because of its ubiquity in nature",

    "for example , the problem of a brownian particle diffusing in smoothly corrugated channels was studied in @xcite .",

    "@xcite also investigated the case of finite sized particles interacting through a hard  core potential and diffusing in a confined environment .",
    "we will focus on identical particles , interacting through a hard - core potential .",
    "if the system is one - dimensional , the process is known as single file diffusion , see e.g. @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are interested in diffusion along a narrow channel of variable transverse area and in the effects of a repulsive interaction among particles .",
    "we propose a generalization of the fick - jacobs equation in order to take into account the interaction .",
    "first we have to obtain the fokker - planck equation for interacting particles , since the fick - jacobs equation is derived from it .",
    "we arrive to the non - linear fokker - planck equation for fermions and bosons that can be reinterpreted for particles with repulsive or attractive interactions .",

    "jacobs @xcite introduced an effective one - dimensional diffusion equation , usually referred to as fick - jacobs equation , for the description of diffusion of non - interacting particles in a tube of varying cross section .",
    "if the cross section is constant , the problem is reduced to a simple one dimensional process .",
    "but if there is a region with , for example , a larger transverse area , a brownian particle spends more time exploring the available space and the random walk along the direction of the tube is slowed .",
    "let us consider the @xmath0 axis along the center of the tube ; @xmath1 is the transverse area at @xmath0 . for simplicity ,",
    "we use two dimensional systems , in which @xmath1 is the width of the channel ( it is straightforward to extend the results to three dimensions ) .",
    "the local concentration is @xmath2 and evolves according to the diffusion equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a constant diffusion coefficient and the tube geometry is taken into account in the boundary conditions .",
    "jacobs gives an equation for the reduced one dimensional concentration @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 . at equilibrium , @xmath8 is constant and @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "an external potential @xmath10 is included in the more general version @xcite :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the free energy and @xmath13 is interpreted as the entropy ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the main assumption in the derivation of ( [ fj1 ] ) or ( [ fj2 ] ) is local equilibrium , i.e. , for each point @xmath0 , the particle distribution in the transverse direction is approximately homogeneous , so that we can write @xmath15 the aim is to derive a fick - jacobs equation for particles with hard core interaction . in the next section",
    "we obtain , as a first step , the diffusion equation for interacting particles .",
    "then we obtain the corresponding fick - jacobs equation .",
    "let us consider a one dimensional lattice ; @xmath16 or 1 is the occupation number of site @xmath17 , and consecutive sites are separated a distance @xmath18 ( as shown below , the results are easily generalized to higher dimensions ) .",
    "the current between sites @xmath17 and @xmath19 for a given configuration is : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the transition rate from @xmath17 to @xmath19 , that satisfies the relation @xmath22 we have separated the external potential @xmath23 from the interaction potential @xmath24 , that depends on the configuration @xmath25 .",
    "it is convenient to define the transition rate @xmath26 so that the current ( [ current ] ) takes the form @xmath27 the interaction potential in site @xmath17 , @xmath28 , is infinite if the site is occupied and 0 otherwise , so that @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that the variation of the external potential is small @xmath30 , then @xmath31 we are interested in the configuration average of the current , @xmath32 , and the occupation number , @xmath33 .",
    "we take the decorrelation of the product @xmath34 ( this does not usually hold for occupation number of tagged particles , as explained in @xcite , but in our case particles are indistinguishable and it turns out that the decorrelation is a valid approximation ) . in the continuous limit we replace the discrete variables by fields as follows : @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 ; we approximate @xmath39 and consider that the concentration is smooth , @xmath40 . after some algebra , from ( [ curr2 ] ) we obtain @xmath41 where the diffusion coefficient @xmath4 is equal to @xmath42 . in the following ,",

    "the same equation ( [ fpeq ] ) is obtained , the only difference is a scaling of the concentration @xmath52 .",
    "a value of the concentration equal 1 means that the maximum number of particles is reached .",
    "a further generalization is to consider attractive potentials of the form @xmath53 . in this case , using again the scaling @xmath52 , the equation becomes @xmath54 \\label{bosons}\\ ] ]    we arrived to the well known fokker - planck equations for fermions ( [ fpeq ] ) and bosons ( [ bosons ] ) @xcite with the peculiarity of a classical context .",

    "these two geometries exemplify the accuracy of the equation obtained , but we are confident that similar results will be found with different cavities",
