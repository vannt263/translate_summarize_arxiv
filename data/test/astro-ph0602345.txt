    "a phase transition from nuclear to quark matter within a neutron star ( ns ) with millisecond scale rotation period can induce a collapse that releases up to @xmath1erg in energy , which potentially relates this process to violent phenomena such as core collapse supernovae  @xcite or @xmath2ray bursts ( grbs )  @xcite .",
