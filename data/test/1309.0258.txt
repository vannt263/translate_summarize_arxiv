    "since the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) superconducting / superfluid phase , which is a condensate of cooper pairs with finite center of mass momentum and the spatially modulated order parameter  @xcite , was proposed in the 1960s , the theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted in a variety of areas , ranging from heavy fermions  @xcite , dense quark matter  @xcite , ultracold atomic gases  @xcite , and so forth .",
    "this unconventional pairing state can be realized by pairing the particles on different fermi surfaces that are mismatched in spin - polarized systems  @xcite , as well as by pairing the particles on a single fermi surface that is deformed by breaking the spatial inversion symmetry  @xcite . however , the region occupied by the fflo phase in the @xmath1 phase diagram of ultracold fermions is typically small in 2 and 3 dimensions and becomes diminished with increasing temperature  @xcite . in the 1d ultracold atomic fermi gas with spin imbalance ,",
    "on the other hand , the fflo phase occupies a much larger portion of the phase diagram @xcite , although both the fflo phase ( with spin imbalance ) and the conventional bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid phase ( with equal number of up and down spins ) are only power law ordered in 1d even at @xmath1 . starting from the bethe ansatz equations  @xcite",
    ", one finds that the 1d polarized fermi gas can host an unpolarized uniform superfluid phase , an fflo superfluid phase , a fully - polarized normal phase , and the vacuum .",
    "although in 1d the fflo phase occupies a large region of the @xmath1 phase diagram , the study of 1d system in the frame of mean - field theory is problematic .",
    "this is because the pair fluctuations become significant with the reduced dimensionality and true long - range order in 1d is completely destroyed by the mermin - wagner theorem but has only power - law correlations in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "also , experimental investigations of the superfluid phases are hard since the transition temperature @xmath2 of the 1d superfluid is zero . in order to overcome these technical difficulties peculiar to pure 1d systems , the two - dimensional array of 1d atomic `` tubes ''",
    "@xcite has been proposed as a model of quasi-1d fermi gas , where atoms are allowed to move freely in one direction and tightly confined in the transverse motion  @xcite . in this",
    "weakly coupled 1d system the atomic motion is gas - like in the axial direction but the weak coupling in the transverse lattice plane stabilizes the long - range superfluid order .",
    "the stabilization of the long - range order allows the use of mean field theory while the anisotropy between the couplings in the axial direction and the transverse plane still reveals the behavior specific to 1d . in this model",
    ", the mean - field study shows that the parameter space of the fflo superfluid phase is enhanced in a spin - polarized quasi-1d fermi gas as the confinement of the atomic motion in the transverse directions is enhanced ( that is , as the system becomes more and more 1d - like ) .",
    "in addition , this model allows one to investigate the behavior of the system during the crossover from the 3d to 1d regimes by increasing the optical lattice strength that controls the transverse hopping between the tubes .",
    "the presence of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and external zeeman fields in otherwise uniform @xmath0-wave superfluids / superconductors is another topic of great current interest .",
    "these effects in combination with long - ranged superfluid order can produce interesting phases such as non - centrosymmetric superconductors  @xcite and nonuniform superfluids in ultracold systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these rich quantum phases , the combination of soc and a suitably directed zeeman field allows one to take a further step towards novel quantum states , the topological superconducting / superfluid phases  @xcite . in solid state systems , spin - orbit coupled semiconducting thin films and nanowires with proximity induced @xmath0-wave superconductivity and a zeeman field",
    "can host novel non - abelian topological states with the order parameter defects such as the vortex cores and the sample edges supporting localized topological zero - energy excitations called majorana fermions  @xcite . since the soc and zeeman field in @xmath0-wave superfluids induce topological superfluid phases in 1d with majorana fermion end states , while at the same time the crossover from 3d to quasi-1d in the presence of a zeeman field enhances the stability of the fflo phase , it is a natural question to ask what is the precise behavior of the system as it crosses over from 3d to 1d but in the presence of both spin - orbit coupling and a zeeman field .",
    "in particular , we ask which of the two phases between the ( a ) topological uniform superfluid ( that contains the majorana fermion end states and an otherwise gapped spectrum ) and ( b ) the fflo non - uniform superfluid ( that contains non - zero center of mass momentum cooper pairs and may be gapless ) is preferred as the system crosses over from 3d to quasi-1d in the presence of both zeeman field and soc . in this paper",
    "we address this question by calculating the @xmath1 phase diagram of a set of parallel 1d `` tubes '' arranged in a 2d lattice in the presence of a zeeman field and an additional rashba type spin - orbit coupling .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the mean - field theory of the above quasi-1d fermi gas under the effective zeeman field together with synthetic spin - orbit coupling , and show that the @xmath1 phase diagram can host both the uniform superfluid state with zero center of mass momentum cooper pairs , the uniform topological superfluid with majorana fermions edge states , and a fflo state with non - zero center of mass momentum cooper pairs .",
    "most importantly , we find that the uniform topological superfluid and the fflo state occur in distinctly different regimes of the ( zeeman field - soc ) phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) ) . from the uniform ( non - topological ) superfluid state",
    "the fflo state is the leading instability at high enough zeeman fields but only for small values of the spin - orbit coupling . for larger values of the soc , the fflo phase disappears from the phase diagram and the uniform non - topological superfluid state transitions into a uniform _ topological _ superfluid state for high values of the zeeman field .",
    "this result will be experimentally very useful because it clearly separates the two interesting unconventional superfluid phases  topological superfluid and fflo  into distinct regimes of the phase diagram as the system crosses over from 3d to 1d with the tuning of the transverse lattice .",
    "the emergence of the fflo phase with the zeeman field for small values of the spin - orbit coupling is easily understood from the fact that the dominant instability of the system as it crosses over to 1d in the presence of a zeeman field ( but no soc ) is to the fflo phase . for small soc",
    "this instability persists and the system moves into the fflo phase beyond a critical value of the zeeman field via a first order phase transition .",
    "the soc disfavors the fflo phase , however , since it creates a mixing of the spins in the same band , thus increasing the tendency of the system to create spin - singlet @xmath0-wave pairs from the same band ( note that , for symmetric fermi surfaces , the fflo phase is a result of pairing between electrons from the different spin - split bands ) . with increasing values of the soc the system transitions from the fflo phase to the uniform superfluid phase ( in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] moving horizontally for a high enough zeeman field ) finally entering into the topological superfluid phase with majorana fermions at a second order topological quantum phase transition ( tqpt ) .",
    "we find that the fflo phases are gapless ( see fig .  [ fig-2](a ) ) , while the uniform topological superfluid phase is gapped ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-2](b ) ) in the bulk but with zero energy majorana fermion excitations at the ends of the 1d tubes .",
    "in addition to these interesting phases , within the fflo phase itself we find a topologically distinct fflo phase ( indicated as fflo-2 in fig .",
    "1 ) setting in at higher values of the zeeman field .",
    "this new fflo phase is characterized by a non - trivial value of a certain relevant topological invariant known as pfaffian invariant for 1d systems that usually signals , in the presence of a gapped spectrum , the emergence of a topological phase with majorana fermion edge states .",
    "in contrast to the uniform topological superfluid state ( shown as uts in fig .",
    "1 ) with majorana fermions end states , however , we find that the spectrum in both topologically distinct fflo phases ( fflo-1 and fflo-2 ) is gapless",
    ". a full characterization of these topologically distinct fflo states is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be taken up in a future publication .",
    "the system we consider in this paper is an array of quasi-1d fermi gas with two hyperfine states , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , confined by a wide trapping potential @xmath5 . to create the two - dimensional lattice of 1d tubes ,",
    "we include optical lattice potential , @xmath6 $ ] , with lattice spacing @xmath7 and depth @xmath8 .",

    "this model of two - dimensional array of 1d tubes has been studied for the fflo superfluid phases in the quasi-1d spin - polarized fermi gas . with sufficiently low density and strong enough @xmath10 ,",
    "the particle motion along the tubes ( @xmath9 direction ) is well described by a parabolic dispersion with a single - band tight - binding dispersion for the @xmath11 motion  @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the uniform superfluid phase ( _ us _ ) with the zero center of mass momentum ( @xmath87 ) cooper pairs takes over the phase diagram even for high values of the zeeman field for larger values of the spin - orbit coupling . for even higher spin - orbit coupling",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) , a high zeeman field induces the topological phase transition within the uniform superfluid phase to a _",
    "topological _ uniform superfluid phase with majorana fermions at the ends of the 1d tubes . in 1d regime , corresponding to small @xmath23 , for small values of the soc , we have found that a topological phase transition can take place within the fflo phase at which the pfaffian topological index changes sign but the system remains gapless .",
    "the principal result of this paper is that , as the system crosses over from 3d to quasi-1d with decreasing transverse hopping , the 3d uniform superfluid phase in a zeeman field crosses over to the fflo phase for small values of the soc but to the topological uniform superfluid state with majorana fermion excitations for larger values of the soc .",
    "therefore , the soc separates the two important unconventional superfluid phases in very different regimes of the parameter space , which should be useful for experimental realizations of these phases in the laboratory .",
    "we have also investigated the crossover physics from 1d to 3d regime by increasing the lattice intensity , corresponding to increasing the transverse hopping @xmath23 in the single - particle dispersion @xmath67 . as anticipated in the phase diagram of 3d fermi gas ,",
    "the fflo phase is diminished with increasing @xmath23 with @xmath27 and @xmath26 fixed , and the uniform superfluid phase becomes favorable energetically .",

    "<S> we consider the quasi - one dimensional system realized by an array of weakly coupled parallel one - dimensional `` tubes '' in a two - dimensional lattice which permits free motion of atoms in an axial direction in the presence of a zeeman field , rashba type spin orbit coupling ( soc ) , and an @xmath0-wave attractive interaction , while the radial motion is tightly confined . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the zero - temperature ( @xmath1 ) bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations for the quasi-1d fermi gas with the dispersion modified by tunneling between the tubes , and show that the @xmath1 phase diagram hosts the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase with non - zero center of mass momentum cooper pairs for small values of the soc while for larger values of the soc and high zeeman fields the uniform superfluid phase with zero center of mass momentum cooper pairs has an instability towards the topological uniform superfluid phase with majorana fermions at the tube ends . </S>",
    "<S> also , we show that tuning the two - dimensional optical lattice strength in this model allows one to explore the crossover behaviors of the phases during the transition between the 3d and the 1d system and in general the fflo ( for small soc ) and the topological uniform superfluid phase ( for large soc ) are favored as the system becomes more one - dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> we also find evidence of the existence of a zeeman tuned topological quantum phase transition ( tqpt ) within the fflo phase itself and for large values of the zeeman field and small soc the tqpt gives rise to a topologically distinct fflo phase . </S>"
