    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions present an unique possibility to create nuclear matter at high densities and temperatures where the hadron properties become different and a phase transition to quark matter with signatures of the deconfinement and restoration of chiral symmetry is expected .",
    "the change of the nucleon mass in the nuclear matter was implemented into the walecka model @xcite already in 1970 s in the framework of the effective hadron field theory . later on this effect",
    "was put on the firmer grounds on the basis of a partial restoration of the chiral symmetry and finite - density qcd sum rules @xcite , the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite , and effective meson field theory @xcite .",
    "dileptons ( @xmath17 @xmath18 ) are the most clear probes of the high density nuclear matter .",
    "the reason is that the dileptons interact with the matter only by electromagnetic forces and can therefore leave the heavy - ion reaction zone essentially undistorted by final state interactions .",
    "they provide valuable information on the in - medium properties of hadrons and , hence , on the state of matter .",
    "the dilepton spectra from heavy - ion collisions have been measured at two different energy scales : by the ceres and helios-3 collaborations at sps @xcite ( a few hundreds gev per nucleon ) and by the dls collaboration at bevalac @xcite ( a few gev per nucleon ) . in the ceres and helios-3 experiments and in the bevalac experiment",
    "the production of dileptons with invariant masses between @xmath19 mev is found to be enhanced as compared to estimates based on the theoretically known dilepton sources when in - medium modifications of hadron properties are neglected .",
    "the data on the total photoabsorption cross section on heavy nuclei @xcite give an evidence for the broadening of nucleon resonances in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "the physics behind is the same as in the collision broadening of the atomic spectral lines in hot and dense gases , discussed by weisskopf in the early 1930 s @xcite ( for the present status of this field , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this rather general effect which takes its origin from the atomic spectroscopy should also lead to a broadening of the @xmath20-mesons in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the low - energy dilepton excess can be explained by a reduction of the @xmath21-meson mass in a dense medium @xcite .",
    "the in - medium modification of the @xmath21-meson spectral function @xcite leading to a broadening of the @xmath21-meson seems also to be sufficient to account for the ceres and helios-3 data @xcite .    in the dls experiment a different temperature and density regime",
    "is probed .",
    "the enhancement of the dilepton spectra due to the reduction of the @xmath20-meson mass and the @xmath20-meson broadening is not sufficient to bring theoretical estimates in coincidence with the available experimental data @xcite .",
    "the in - medium @xmath20-meson scenarios that successfully explain the dilepton yield at sps energies fail for the dls data .",
    "this phenomenon was called the ",
    "dls puzzle  .",
    "it worthwhile to notice that the final data from the dls collaboration have changed by about a factor of @xmath22 as compared to the initially reported results .",
    "the future hades experiment at gsi will study the dilepton spectra at the same energy range in greater details @xcite .    a possibility to clarify",
    "the origin of the dls puzzle has appeared since data from elementary @xmath11 @xmath23 collisions at @xmath24 gev ( @xmath25 is the kinetic energy of the incident proton in the laboratory frame ) became available from the dls collaboration @xcite .",
    "the elementary cross sections enter as an input into the transport simulations of heavy - ion collisions , so their better understanding is of great value .",
    "the dilepton spectra in the @xmath11 collisions at @xmath26 gev have been calculated in refs.@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the agreement achieved with the dls  data is generally good at low energies where the subthreshold production of nucleon resonances is important .",
    "when the energy increases and the inclusive production becomes dominant , the dilepton yield is underestimated at the same mass range @xmath27 mev as in the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "a signature for this effect exists also in the calculations of refs.@xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted to mean that the studies @xcite revealed , apparently , the reoccurrence of the dls puzzle on the elementary level of the nucleon collisions .",
    "they leave , therefore , a doubt on the quality of the experimental data and/or the reliability of the accepted theoretical schemes .",
    "this paper is devoted to a further going theoretical analysis of the elementary dilepton production cross sections .    in the next sect .",
    ", the production mechanisms are critically revisited .",
    "the subthreshold production cross sections for the vector mesons are treated such that no double counting appears with the inclusive processes .",
    "the effect of multiple pion production on the experimental detection efficiency for the dilepton pairs is also studied .",
    "we demonstrate that the detector efficiency is sensitive to the number of pions produced and propose a simple model to account for the multiple pion production effects .    in the dalitz decays of the nucleon resonances , @xmath28 , the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model",
    "is usually applied for the description of the resonance transition form factors . however , the naive vmd which takes the @xmath29 data as an input systematically overestimates the radiative decay branchings . in sect.3 ,",
    "the vmd model is extended to ensure the correct asymptotic behavior of the transition form factors in agreement with the quark counting rules .",
    "such a modification is found to be sufficient to achieve an unified description of both , @xmath30 radiative decays and @xmath14 meson decays .",
    "our estimates of the subthreshold cross sections rely therefore on the two essentially different sets of the experimental data , @xmath13 and @xmath31 .",
    "the numerical results are discussed in sect.4 .",
    "we found that the above improvements do not eliminate the discrepancy with the dls  data at @xmath32 gev .",
    "moreover , the results for the lowest energy , @xmath33 gev , also require an additional study from the experimental and/or theoretical side .",
    "the dilepton production in nucleon collisions goes through the production of virtual photons which decay subsequently into @xmath35 pairs . according to the vmd model , the virtual photons",
    "are coupled to vector mesons @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 the dilepton production can therefore be calculated using the inclusive vector meson production cross sections : @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is the square of the invariant mass of two colliding protons , @xmath41 the invariant mass of the dilepton pair , @xmath42 is the differential vector meson production cross section , and @xmath43 is the average number of additional vector mesons @xmath44 in the state @xmath45 . in the energy range of interest , @xmath26 gev , where @xmath25 is the kinetic energy of the proton in the laboratory system , @xmath46 .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath47 corresponds to the direct @xmath48 decays , with @xmath49 being the total meson decay width .    in order to disentangle the various contributions ,",
    "we decompose the cross section entering into eq.([v1 ] ) into pole and background parts : @xmath50 such a decomposition implies that interference effects between the different sources are neglected . the background sources like @xmath51 and @xmath52 do not interfere due to the kinematical reasons . these two reactions in turn do not interfere with the reaction @xmath53 , since the final states are different .",
    "the reactions @xmath54 , @xmath55 going through the nucleon resonances @xmath56 with different quantum numbers do not interfere with each other either .",
    "the sources like @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 do interfere , however .",
    "the relative phases of the amplitudes describing the different reactions are unknown , so the neglection of the interference between all the reactions constitutes a reasonable first approximation .",
    "the distribution over the meson mass @xmath41 in the pole part of the cross section has a breit - wigner form corrected to the available phase space for the final state @xmath61 . at moderate energies , the state @xmath45",
    "is dominated by two nucleons and pions , so one can write @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the @xmath64-body phase space of the final state ( two nucleons with masses @xmath65 , one vector meson @xmath44 with mass @xmath66 and @xmath67 pions with masses @xmath68 ) . the value @xmath69 $ ] is the maximal number of pions allowed by energy conservation , @xmath70 $ ] denotes the integer value of @xmath71 , and the values @xmath72 are the probabilities for the production of @xmath67 pions , with @xmath73 the normalization factor @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the physical threshold for vector meson decays ( @xmath77 for the @xmath20-meson ) .",
    "notice that the cross section ( [ v2 ] ) vanishes at values @xmath78 @xmath76 .",
    "however , the total width @xmath79 entering into the denominator of the branching ratio ( [ br ] ) at @xmath78 @xmath76 vanishes as well , so that the cross section ( [ v1 ] ) is actually finite everywhere above the two - electron threshold .    in the zero - width limit , @xmath80 eq.([v3 ] ) simplifies to give @xmath81 the finite - width effects are important for the @xmath20-meson and less important for @xmath4- and @xmath5-mesons .",
    "as the background we consider states with @xmath82-mesons originating from the @xmath44-meson strong decays , that do not contribute to the pole part of the cross section of @xmath44-meson production .",
    "we assume _",
    "e.g. _ that the @xmath20-mesons from the reactions @xmath83",
    "@xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 form a background , which should be added to the pole part of @xmath21-mesons production .",
    "( in the last line only the @xmath21-mesons away from the resonance region correspond to background . )",
    "the dilepton invariant mass in all these reactions can be lower than the two - pion threshold . clearly ,",
    "all processes with @xmath87 are not accounted for by the pole part of the inclusive cross section .",
    "their contributions should be added to the contribution of the pole part . with increasing invariant dilepton mass , somewhere in the region @xmath88 ,",
    "we come to the double counting problem .",
    "this part of the spectrum from the above reactions must be excluded as outlined below .",
    "experimental data on the exclusive cross sections @xmath89 with @xmath90 at @xmath91 are not available . here",
    "we assume that the probabilities @xmath72 are described by a binomial distribution @xmath92 to fix all probabilities it is sufficient to know the ratio between the exclusive vector meson production cross section @xmath93 and the inclusive cross section @xmath89 .",
    "these two cross sections are experimentally known @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath94 is defined as above by energy conservation while the value @xmath95 can be extracted from the relation @xmath96 the pion multiplicity equals @xmath97    in the case of the @xmath20-meson , the cross section @xmath89 determines the pole behavior of the total cross section @xmath98 in the vicinity of the @xmath20-meson peak .",
    "like for vector mesons , eq.([v2 ] ) , the total cross section @xmath99 for the @xmath100 production can be decomposed into @xmath20-pole and background parts @xmath101 the background parts on the right hand sides of eq.([v5 ] ) and eq.([v2 ] ) do not coincide since the @xmath102 quantum numbers are not necessarily equal to the quantum numbers of the @xmath20-meson ( this is the case at the @xmath20-meson peak only and this is why with @xmath103 the first terms in eq.([v2 ] ) and eq.([v5 ] ) coincide ) .",
    "thus the left hand sides of eq.([v5 ] ) and eq.([v2 ] ) do not coincide as well . since the @xmath20-meson is always detected via @xmath100 final states ( or via @xmath104 and @xmath105 final states for @xmath106- and @xmath5-mesons , respectively ) , the inclusive cross section for the production of vector mesons which enters into eq.([v1 ] ) can not be uniquely determined from the experimental data on inclusive production of @xmath102 .",
    "instead , one needs a model for the calculation of the background part of the cross section in eq.([v2 ] ) .",
    "a subtle problem of double counting in the total dilepton production cross section appears in this way .",
    "we propose a quite natural phenomenological solution for it .",
    "the background term @xmath107 at @xmath108can be saturated , at least partially , by considering the production of light mesons : @xmath109 @xmath110 , @xmath111 , etc .",
    ", similarly for the @xmath112- and @xmath5-mesons .",
    "the @xmath102 invariant masses are small here , so these processes contribute to the @xmath102 background .",
    "eq.([v1 ] ) can now be rewritten as follows @xmath113 the first term is the same as in eq.([v1 ] ) , i.e. with the sum running over all vector mesons , however , keeping only the pole part of the cross section . in eq.([xsec ] ) the background is divided into contributions from direct decays of intermediate vector mesons , which are off - shell and typically below their physical thresholds ( @xmath114 ) and from decays of intermediate mesons , @xmath115 , to multi - particle final states ( @xmath116 ) . in the latter case , the cross section for the production of the intermediate meson has to be folded over its branching ratio to the final state under consideration :    @xmath117    the sum runs over the mesons @xmath118and@xmath119 here , @xmath120 is the average number of mesons @xmath115 in the state @xmath121 .",
    "the value @xmath122 in the last equation describes the distribution over the off - shell masses of the mesons . for pseudo - scalar mesons , the cross sections due to their small widths are proportional to the delta - function @xmath123 ( cf .",
    "eq.([zero - width ] ) ) and the expression reduces to a sum over the on - shell mesons decaying to the states @xmath124with @xmath125 @xmath126 . for vector mesons entering the sum of eq.([o ] ) one should use the cross sections ( [ v2 ] ) whose pole components are well defined .",
    "the contribution to the background part of the cross section ( [ v1 ] ) with @xmath127can be calculated assuming that it results from subthreshold decays of baryon resonances @xmath128 produced in @xmath11 collisions , which decay into nucleons and vector mesons , @xmath129 @xcite . in terms of the branching ratios for",
    "the dalitz decays of the baryon resonances , the cross section can be written as follows    @xmath130    here , @xmath122 is the running mass of the baryon resonance @xmath56 with the cross section @xmath131 , @xmath132 is the differential branching ratio for the dalitz decay @xmath133 through the vector meson @xmath44 .    with increasing energy , the vector mesons in eq.([1 ] ) can be produced at their physical masses .",
    "in such a case , the processes ( [ 1 ] ) contribute to the pole part of the cross section @xmath134 .",
    "the pole part of inclusive cross sections by definition accounts for all possible sources for the appearance of on - shell vector mesons , so that a naive extension of the subthreshold cross section to higher energies would result in a double counting . to avoid this double counting",
    "we should skip the exclusive part of vector meson production in @xmath11 collision that enters to the total inclusive production of vector mesons as already taken into account in eq.([1 ] ) : @xmath135 the factor @xmath136 excludes the @xmath137 component of the inclusive cross section which is reproduced by the subthreshold mechanizm .",
    "this prescription lies on the comparison of the experimental data to the exclusive vector meson production cross section , that goes through baryon resonances @xmath138 the cross sections reasonably agree ( see figs .",

    ", the cross section is dominated by the @xmath6-dalitz decay below @xmath418mev and by the dalitz decays of the nucleon resonances , mainly the @xmath419-resonance , at @xmath420mev . compared to our calculation",
    "there is an excess of detected @xmath35 pairs at @xmath421 mev .",
    "earlier calculations @xcite obtained higher cross sections in this mass range .",
    "this is due to the normalization to the @xmath422 branching ratios within the framework of the naive vmd which overestimates the radiative decay rates @xmath13 , as discussed in sect.3 .",
    "= 12 cm    at higher initial proton energies , the agreement with the dls  data is generally very reasonable .",

    "the inclusive and subthreshold productions of the @xmath20- and @xmath4-mesons become important at @xmath426mev .",

    "refs.@xcite agree quite well with the experimental data at the @xmath403-meson region . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the inclusive @xmath403-peak is not reproduced , apparently , due to a stronger _ ad hoc _ smearing with a mass - dependent parameter @xmath428 .",
    "the smearing at the @xmath403-meson peak turns out to be factor of 3 greater than it should ( @xmath429 = 80 mev instead of 25 mev ) . in refs.@xcite , the @xmath403-chanels from the nucleon resonance decays are neglected .",
    "this is the reason for the difference between our results and relults of refs.@xcite . in our calculations ,",
    "the @xmath403-chanel contribution is large .",
    "it can only be lowered by price of an _ ad hoc _ reduction of the decay probabilities of the nucleon resonances into the vector mesons , which has been calculated using the quark models @xcite .",
    "the quark models reproduce , however , the @xmath21-meson decays of the nucleon resonances quite well , i.e. they are in good agreement with the partial - wave analysis of the @xmath404 inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "in this way the experimental underestimation of the dilepton yield at the @xmath403-peak at @xmath425gev seems to contradict the @xmath404 inelastic scattering data .",
    "remarkably , the three highest experimental points at @xmath425gev lie above the kinematical limit @xmath430mev and the indicated experimental error @xmath415  mev is not sufficient to explain their occurrence .",
    "we suppose that the experimental resolution is not good enough to resolve the kinematic threshold .    finally , at @xmath431gev , the contribution from the inclusive production of the @xmath7- , @xmath20- , and @xmath4-mesons becomes dominant at @xmath432mev . there is an underestimation of the dilepton yield in the region @xmath433mev .",
    "a similar underestimation was found in @xcite both , at @xmath425gev and @xmath431gev .",
    "as proposed in ref.@xcite , the existing gap might be filled by the subthreshold dilepton production via the baryon resonances .",
    "however , we were not able to match the data using a consistent description of the photoproduction data and the @xmath29 meson decay branchings , with the proper application of the breit - wigner formula ( see details in appendix 1 ) , and removing possible sources for the double counting .",
    "each of this three aspects leads to a reduction of the dilepton yield .",
    "therefore , one can not exclude that the origin of the so called  dls puzzle  can be traced back to the elementary @xmath434 level and is not a specific feature of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "new experimental measurements of the dilepton cross section , especially at @xmath25 = 1.04 , 2.09 , and 4.88 gev , would certainly help to clarify this point .    in this context one should be aware that the comparison to the experimental data is strongly influenced by the acceptance of the dls detector . in appendix 2",
    ", we discuss the application of the corresponding filter program @xcite for the calculation of the experimentally measured cross sections . in fig.[fig4 ] the effective detector efficiency , smeared by a gaussian distribution with the standard deviation @xmath416mev , is shown as a function of the dilepton mass @xmath41 for decays @xmath435 @xmath436 and @xmath437 at the two highest proton energies @xmath425gev and @xmath431gev , where the effects of the multiple pion production are most important .",
    "it can be seen that the effective acceptance decreases with increasing energy for a fixed number of pions in the final state . on the other hand , when the number of pions increases , the acceptance increases as well .",
    "this can be interpreted to mean that a larger number of the pions reduces the available phase space for mesons decaying to the dilepton pairs , and the decays of such mesons can be detected with better efficiency .",
    "= 12 cm    the effect is particularly strong for the @xmath438 decay at @xmath32 gev .",
    "while the average pion multiplicity @xmath140 is around @xmath439 the effective acceptance is extremely small below @xmath440 .",
    "the acceptance is not reliable when it is much smaller than unity . in our case",
    "this happens at @xmath441 .",
    "while the statistical distribution gives here , as we expect , reasonable estimates , the calculation of the part of the cross section connected to the additional production of @xmath441 pions turns out to be unreliable . from the other side , at @xmath442 the filter",
    "is well defined , but the binomial distribution gives exponentially small probabilities .",
    "the highest part of the pion spectra corresponding to @xmath443 also can not be calculated accurately .",
    "so , we consider the difference between our results for the pion contributions and those of refs.@xcite by about a factor of @xmath444 and those of ref.@xcite by about a factor of @xmath445 as a conservative estimate for uncertainties inherent in the theoretical calculations for both , the distribution over the pion multiplicities and the experimental filter acceptance in the region of small invariant masses .    at lower energies , these uncertainties practically disappear . in fig.[fig4 ] , we show a plot for the @xmath438 decay at @xmath446 gev",
    ". it can be seen that now already for @xmath447 the effective acceptance is no more extremely small . for heavier mesons ,",
    "the calculation of the acceptance is safer , which is again connected with less energy available for the produced mesons and , respectively , a better efficiency for the detection of the dileptons .    for the application of the filter we assumed an isotropic distribution of the particles in the final states in the c.m .",
    "this is justified at small energies @xmath25 . with increasing kinetic energy ,",
    "the distribution acquires a bias towards the beam direction .",
    "this is an additional source of uncertainties in the calculations of the filter , which can be important at energy @xmath32 gev for the pion dalitz decays .    the many - body phase spaces entering into eq.(4 )",
    "are known to be very sharp functions of the arguments .",
    "the breit - wigner distribution over the dilepton mass , @xmath41 , gets therefore an enhancement towards small values of @xmath41 .",
    "the greater the number of pions in the final state , the more important is this effect .",
    "we found that rare processes with probabilities @xmath448 corresponding to large numbers of pions produced in association with the vector mesons , that should in principle give small contributions to the total cross sections , become very important at masses @xmath449 mev .",
    "the spectral functions of the vector mesons are not known well far away from the vector meson peaks .",
    "this effect is thus beyond the scope of the present model .",
    "it should be analysed separately . in the present calculations ,",
    "we apply a @xmath450 criterion to the multiple pion processes : the values @xmath72 are set equal to zero every time when @xmath451 this works for the inclusive vector meson production at @xmath452gev . at smaller energies pions",
    "are not produced in association with vector mesons .",
    "we have considered the dilepton production in @xmath11 collisions at bevalac energies .",
