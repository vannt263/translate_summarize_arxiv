    "in feynman s statistical mechanics textbook , it is stated that the many - body ground state wavefunctions of bosons are _ positive - definite _ in the coordinate representation provided no external rotation is applied and interactions are short - ranged @xcite .",
    "the proof is very intuitive : due to the time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry , the ground state wavefunction @xmath0 can be chosen as real . if it is not positive - definite , _",
    "i.e. _ , it has nodes , the following surgery can be done to lower its energy .",
    "we first take its absolute value of @xmath1 , whose energy expectation value is exactly the same as that of @xmath0 .",
    "however , such a wavefunction has kinks at node points . further smoothing the kinks results in a positive - definite wavefunction , and the kinetic energy",
    "is lowered by softening the gradients of the wavefunction .",
    "although the single body potential energy and the two - body interaction energy increase , they are small costs of a high order compared to the gain of the kinetic energy . we can further conclude that the ground state is non - degenerate because two degenerate positive - definite wavefunctions can not be orthogonal to each other .",
    "this `` no - node '' theory is a very general statement , which applies to almost all the well - known ground states of bosons , including the superfluid , mott - insulating , density - wave , and even super - solid ground states .",
    "it is also a very strong statement , which reduces the generally speaking complex - valued many - body wavefunctions to be positive - definite distributions .",
    "this is why the ground state properties of bosonic systems , such as @xmath2he , can in principle be exactly simulated by the quantum monte - carlo method free of the sign problem .",
    "furthermore , this statement implies that the ordinary ground states of bosons , including bose - einstein condensations ( bec ) and mott - insulating states , can not spontaneously break time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry , since tr transformation for the single component bosons is simply the operation of the complex conjugation",
    ".    it would be exciting to search for exotic emergent states of bosons beyond this `` no - node '' paradigm , whose many - body wavefunctions can be complex - valued with spontaneous tr symmetry breaking . since properties of complex - valued functions are much richer than those of real - valued ones , we expect such states can exhibit more intriguing properties than the ordinary ground states of bosons .",
    "for this purpose , we have recently made much progress with two different ways to bypass feynman s argument , including the meta - stable states of bosons in the high orbital bands of optical lattices @xcite and multi - component bosons with spin - orbit coupling linearly dependent on momentum @xcite .",
    "clearly , the `` no - node '' theorem is a ground state property which does not apply to the excited states of bosons . the recent rapid development of optical lattices with ultra - cold bosons provides a wonderful opportunity to investigate the meta - stable states of bosons pumped into high orbital bands . due to the lack of dissipation channels",
    ", the life time can be long enough to develop inter - site coherence @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the interaction among orbital bosons are characterized by the `` _ orbital hund s rule _ '' @xcite , which gives rise to a class of complex superfluid states by developing the on - site orbital angular momentum ( oam ) moments . in the lattice systems ,",
    "the inter - site hoppings of bosons lock the oam polarization into regular patterns depending the concrete lattice structures .",
    "furthermore , the `` no - node '' theorem even does not apply to the ground states of bosons if their hamiltonians linearly depend on momentum , i.e. , the gradient operator .",
    "a trivial example is the formation of vortices in bose condensates with the external rotation in which the coriolis force is represented as the vector potential linearly coupled to momentum .",
    "however , in this case tr symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "a non - trivial example is that bosons with spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , whose hamiltonians also linearly depend on momentum and are tr invariant .",
    "the invalidity of the `` no - node '' theorem can also give rise to complex - valued ground state wavefunctions .    although @xmath2he is spinless and most bosonic alkali atoms are too heavy to exhibit the relativistic so coupling in their center - of - mass motion , so coupling can be important in exciton systems in two dimensional quantum wells .",
    "we have shown that the rashba so coupling in the conduction electron bands induces the same type of so coupling in the center - of - mass motion of excitons . in a harmonic trap",
    ", the ground state condensate wavefunction can spontaneously develop half - quantum vortex structure and the skyrmion type of the spin texture configuration @xcite . on the other hand , effective so coupling in boson systems can be induced by laser beams , which has been investigated in several publications by other groups in refs @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will review our work in both directions outlined above including many new results unpublished before .",
    "in section [ sect : boson ] , we explain the characteristic feature of interacting bosons in high orbital bands , the `` orbital hund s rule '' , and the consequential complex - superfluid states with the ordering of on - site oam moments .",
    "the ordering of oam moments in the mott - insulating states is also investigated . in section [",
    "sect : spinorbit ] , we review the tr symmetry breaking states of spinful bosons with spin - orbit coupling .",
    "interesting properties including half - quantum vortex , and the skyrmion - like spin - textures are studied .",
    "conclusions are made in section [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "due to the limit of space , we will not cover interesting related topics of orbital bosons , such as the nematic superfluid state @xcite and the algebraic superfluid state @xcite , and the orbital physics with cold fermions @xcite , which has also aroused much research attention recently .",
    "in this section , we will review the `` complex - condensation '' with tr symmetry breaking , which is a new state of the @xmath3-orbital bosons .",
    "this is an example of novel orbital physics in optical lattice with cold bosons .",
    "below let us give a brief general introduction to orbital physics for the general audience .",
    "orbital is a degree of freedom independent of charge and spin .",
    "it plays important roles in magnetism , superconductivity , and transport in transition metal oxides @xcite .",
    "the key features of orbital physics are orbital degeneracy and spatial anisotropy .",
    "optical lattices bring new features to orbital physics which are not easily accessible in solid state orbital systems .",
    "first , optical lattices are rigid lattices and free from the jahn - teller distortion , thus orbital degeneracy is robust .",
    "second , the meta - stable bosons pumped into high orbital bands exhibit novel superfluidity beyond feynman s `` no - node '' theory @xcite .",
    "third , @xmath3-orbitals have stronger spatial anisotropy than that of @xmath4 and @xmath5-orbitals , while correlation effects in @xmath3-orbital solid state systems ( e.g. semiconductors ) are not that strong .",
    "in contrast , interaction strength in optical lattices is tunable .",
    "we can integrate strong correlation with spatial anisotropy more closely than ever in @xmath3-orbital optical lattice systems @xcite .",
    "recently , orbital physics with cold atoms has been attracting a great deal of attention@xcite . for orbital bosons , a series of theory works",
    "have been done @xcite , including the illustration of the ferro - orbital nature of interactions @xcite , orbital superfluidity with spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking @xcite , the nematic superfluidity@xcite .",
    "the theory work on the @xmath3-orbital fermions is also exciting including the flat band and associated strong correlation physics in the honeycomb lattice @xcite , orbital exchange and frustration @xcite , and topological insulators @xcite .",
    "the experimental progress has been truly exciting @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have realized the meta - stable @xmath3-orbital boson systems by using the stimulated raman transition .",
    "the spatially anisotropic phase coherence pattern has been observed in the time of flight experiments .",
    "sebby - strabley _",
    "_ @xcite have successfully pumped bosons into excited bands in the double - well lattice .",
    "in addition , @xmath3-orbital bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) has also been observed in quasi one - dimensional exciton - polariton lattice systems @xcite .    below we illustrate the important feature of interactions between orbital bosons , the `` orbital hund s rule '' , which results in tr symmetry breaking .",
    "the most remarkable feature of interacting bosons in high orbital bands is that they favor to maximize their onsite orbital angular momentum ( oam ) as explained below @xcite .",
    "let us illustrate this hund s rule type physics through the simplest example : a single site problem with two degenerate @xmath6-orbitals filled with two spinless bosons . because bosons are indistinguishable , the hilbert space for the two - body states only contains three states , which can be classified according to their oam : an oam singlet as @xmath7 depicted in fig [ fig : pboson ] .",
    "a , and a pair of oam doublets @xmath8 , the interaction energy of the former is calculated as @xmath9 while that of the latter is @xmath10 with the definition of u = gd r^2 |_p_x ( r)|^4= gd r^2 |_p_y ( r)|^4 . in the oam singlet state , bosons occupy polar ( real ) orbitals ( e.g. @xmath11 ) , whose angular distribution in real space is narrower than that of the axial ( complex ) orbitals ( e.g. @xmath12 ) for the oam doublets . by occupying the same axial orbital and therefore maximizing oam , two bosons enjoy more room to avoid each other .",
    "this `` ferro - orbital '' interaction is captured by the following multi - band hubbard hamiltonian for the @xmath3-orbital bosons as h_int=_r \\{n^2_r- l_z^2 } , [ eq : bshamint ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the first term is the ordinary hubbard interaction and the second term arises because of the orbital degree of freedom . in three dimensional systems in which all of the three @xmath3-orbitals are present",
    ", we only need to replace @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 defined as @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "when more than two bosons occupy a single site , bosons prefer to go to the same single particle state by their statistical properties . again going into the same axial state and thus maximizing oam",
    "can reduce their repulsive interaction energy .",
    "this is an analogy to the hund s rule of electron s filling in atomic shells .",
    "the first hund s rule of electrons maximizes electron total spin to antisymmetrize their wavefunction , and the second hund s rule further maximize their oam to extend the spatial volume of wavefunction .",
    "the key feature is that electrons want to avoid each other as possible as they can . for the orbital physics of spinless bosons",
    ", the same spirit applies with the maximizing of oam .",
    "now we have understood the single site physics in which bosons develop rotation . from the symmetry point of view",
