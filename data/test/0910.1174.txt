    "in many physical processes one encounters a stochastic variable whose mean squared fluctuations increase with time @xmath4 as @xmath1 with @xmath5 .",
    "these processes are sometimes referred to as anomalous diffusion  @xcite , and specifically _ subdiffusion _ for @xmath6 .",
    "such behavior is usually caused by the collective dynamics of numerous degrees of freedom , or modes with a broad distribution of characteristic times .",
    "the exact relations between the underlying modes and the observed coordinate are usually unknown , and first - principle derivation of the equations governing the anomalous diffuser are rare . as a result , a variety of such processes are typically grouped into broad classes in accordance to their general characteristics  @xcite .",
    "while the exponent @xmath3 is an important and convenient indicator of anomalous dynamics , it contains little information on the hidden underlying driving forces .",
    "a different set of properties of a diffuser can be revealed by observing its _ first passage _ to a target , or its absorption at a trap  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it has been established  @xcite that the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath7 to be absorbed for one - dimensional ( 1d ) subdiffusion between two absorbing walls has a power law tail , if the process is described by a fractional diffusion equation  @xcite .",
    "this slow decay of @xmath7 for a subdiffuser following such dynamics leads to a diverging mean absorption time .",
    "on the other hand , kantor and kardar  @xcite demonstrated that a monomer in a gaussian polymer that is characterized by @xmath8 has a finite absorption time when it diffuses between two absorbing boundaries .",
    "the presence of absorbing boundaries introduces additional characteristics , such as the long time behavior of the survival probability @xmath9 in the presence of a single absorbing wall , or the behavior of the pdf of particle position near the trap . in specific cases with a well - defined @xmath3 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) some aspects of absorption characteristics have been determined . however , in the absence of rigorous scaling relations one can not establish whether the exponent @xmath3 determines all other characteristics .",
    "recently , zoia _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used some general scaling arguments to propose such a relation , furthering the need to probe such properties with tunable exponent @xmath3 .    while it is generally recognized that underlying ( hidden ) processes are responsible for anomalous dynamics , many theoretical approaches simplify the problem to effective equations for the observed variable , hoping to capture the multitude of underlying interactions .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason for such an approach to succeed , and it is therefore useful to consider alternative models where the underlying processes are well characterized . in this work",
    "we consider a model in which subdiffusion is generated as a result of superposition of underlying modes with a broad range of time scales .",
    "for solvability and ease of simulation we limit ourselves to linear ( but stochastic ) dynamics for the modes .",
    "our model is closely related to the dynamics of a gaussian polymer , or to fluctuations of a gaussian interface . in the polymer language , which we adapt for most of the presentation , the anomalous behavior of a single ( tagged ) monomer @xcite",
    "is easily understood in terms of the superposition of underlying rouse modes .",
    "the resulting exponent @xmath3 depends on whether the polymer dynamics is diffusive ( rouse ) or influenced by hydrodynamic interactions ( zimm ) . the difference between the two cases can be cast as due to a wave - length dependent friction coefficients .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : mod ] we take this analogy a step further , and show that any value of @xmath3 can be generated by appropriate scaling of the friction coefficients with wavelength .",
    "while we adapt notions from polymer physics in developing our model , the approach we take is not intended to address any particular polymer problem .",
    "rather , we rely on this well - defined mathematical model to explore issues pertinent to anomalous diffusion ( specifically absorption ) , and to compare and contrast with other mathematical models introduced in this context . our approach is closely related to the model proposed by krug _",

    "[ sec : abs ] and [ sec : pdfs ] .",
    "in particular , we explore the long - time tails of the absorbtion probability @xmath7 , as well as the asymptotic stable shapes of the pdfs of the surviving walkers .",
    "qualitatively , various quantities have similar features for a variety of @xmath3 . however , we find that @xmath3 does not enter the results in a trivial way , and the stable function for one @xmath3 can not be obtained from another by simple transformation .",
    "moreover , the comparison of results for our walker with exponent @xmath3 coinciding with that of a polymer translocating though a membrane pore ( sec .  [ sec : transloc ] ) demonstrates quantitative differences between the two cases .",

    "indeed , the time dependent pdf for a normal diffuser between two absorbing boundaries is represented by a sum of spatial sinusoidal modes ( eigenfunctions of the laplacian operator ) multiplied by functions of time which are pure exponentials . at large times only the lowest harmonic corresponding to the slowest decay , survives .",
    "thus for normal diffusion in the interval between two absorbing boundaries at @xmath174 , the spatial probability at long times behaves as @xmath175 , again vanishing linearly at the endpoints . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that for @xmath69 , at times significantly larger than the mean absorbtion time , the normalized pdf of positions of the surviving tagged monomer has a stable shape different from a cosine .",

    "the properly normalized pdf of surviving monomers progresses from a gaussian with variance growing linearly in time ( for @xmath176 ) , to a gaussian with variance increasing as @xmath1 at intermediate times , before settling down to a stable shape beyond the point of maximum of @xmath7 in fig .",

    "as we were initially lead to this subject in connection with polymer translocation , it is fitting to conclude by returning to this issue .",
    "translocation , the passage of a polymer through a pore in a membrane , is an important process that has been studied extensively in the last decade  @xcite .",
    "phages , for example , invade bacteria by taking advantage of existing channels in bacterial membranes to translocate their dna / rna inside  @xcite . in theoretical models , it is convenient to study a translocation coordinate @xmath182 which denotes the number of monomers @xmath182 on one side of the pore .",
    "the dynamics of this coordinate is anomalous : if we assume that the translocation time is of the order of polymer relaxation time",
    "@xmath90  @xcite , then the variance of @xmath182 will increase with time as @xmath183 with @xmath184 ( rouse dynamics ) .",
    "( for a self - avoiding polymer diffusing in 2d , @xmath185 and @xmath186 . ) we note that the actual value of the exponent @xmath187 also involves factors not explicitly related to the polymer dynamics : ( i ) that self - avoiding effects expand the equilibrium size of the polymer in the physical space ; and ( ii ) that the relevant variable represents a 1d coordinate in the _ internal _ space of monomer numbers .",
    "while the expression for the actual exponent has been supported numerically in some studies  @xcite , and disputed in others  @xcite , the anomalous nature of dynamics is not in question .    to simplify the process",
    ", numerical implementations frequently begin by inserting half of the polymer into the pore ( i.e. @xmath188 ) and allowing the polymer to diffuse until either of its ends ( @xmath189 or @xmath190 ) leaves the pore .",

    "( b ) for times larger than the typical translocation time the distribution of translocation time decays exponentially , as in @xmath7 in the current work .",

    "while the curves are quite similar , they do not coincide .",
    "the translocation data is represented by a narrower bell - shaped curve , and close to the boundaries is better described by a power law with exponent @xmath194  @xcite , while the curve obtained in our simulations produces a lower exponent of @xmath195 .",
    "the differences between the two behaviors is better observed on the logarithmic scale in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : trans ] .",
    "thus , there are quantitative differences between translocation and anomalous diffusion of a monomer with a similar exponent @xmath3 .      in this work we concentrated on a group of subdiffusion processes in which a tunable anomalous exponent @xmath3 is generated through collective behavior of many degrees of freedom .",
    "this is achieved by superposition of linear modes in which the relaxation times are scaled by a power law . in the polymer language this corresponds to following a tagged monomer when the friction coefficients of the rouse modes have a power - law dependence on wavelength . in the absence of absorbing boundaries",
    "the model can be solved exactly ; starting from a point the pdf of the anomalous walker is a gaussian whose width grows in time as @xmath196 .",
    "we were not able to solve the problem in the presence of absorbing boundaries , and resorted to numerical simulations . with a single absorbing point",
    "the pdf of absorption decays slowly at long times as @xmath197 .",
    "the power law decay can be justified by noting that the particle can avoid absorption by moving away from the trapping point .",
    "a qualitative understanding of the behavior is not yet attained : estimates based on the fractional fokker - planck equation suggest @xcite @xmath146 , while an alternative picture from fractional brownian motion suggests @xcite @xmath148 .",
    "reference @xcite provides provides numerical support for the latter , while our results are more consistent with the former .",
    "the possibility of systematic errors prevents us from making a definite statement on this point , and indicate necessity of further work .",
    "when the tagged monomer is confined to an interval bounded by two traps , the survival probability is found to decay exponentially at long times , irrespective of the subdiffusive exponent .",
    "an interesting feature of the process is the vanishing of the pdf on approaching an absorbing boundary ( whether single or double ) .",
    "the method of images , which is only valid for regular ( markovian ) diffusion , predicts a linear approach to zero , while our simulations indicate a singular form characterized by an exponent @xmath168 for anomalous walks .",
    "while we can not determine this exponent precisely due to various sampling problems , our results do not appear to support recently proposed exponent relations @xcite .",
    "the similarities in the shapes of the stable pdfs of surviving walkers in an interval for different values of @xmath3 , initially raised the hope that they can be collapsed by a simple transformation ( e.g.raising them to some power ) .",
    "however , the mismatch between the curves obtained for different exponents @xmath3 is sufficient to rule out an over - arching super - universality .",
    "furthermore , the discrepancies between translocation of a self - avoiding polymer and an anomalous diffuser with a similar exponent , suggest that the exponent @xmath3 is not sufficient to characterize universality . the situation is reminiscent of critical phenomena in which gaussian ( linear ) models",
    "can be devised to reproduce a particular critical exponent , but which do not capture the full complexity of the non - linear theory .",
    "the absence of definitive agreement between numerics and proposed models is on one hand disappointing , but on the other hand points to the necessity of further work and clarification .",
    "the linear nature of the underlying model raises the hope that exact solutions may be within reach . in the meantime",
    "the model does provide a means of generating anomalous walkers with a tunable exponent that incorporate some realistic features of collective dynamics of interacting degrees of freedom .",
    "there are certainly puzzles pertaining to the behavior of such anomalous walkers close to an absorbing boundary . to answer these questions simulations need to probe sufficiently short times to remain in the regime of anomalous dynamics , but long enough to ensure convergence to stable forms .",
    "our simulations had a rather limited range of times satisfying the above constraints .",
    "while one order of magnitude increase in @xmath10 could open a broad range of validity of the above conditions , it would significantly slow down the simulations .",
    "in addition , working at longer times significantly increases the attrition of the samples , and requires increasing sample size by several orders of magnitude .",
