    "the io plasma torus is a dense ( @xmath02000 @xmath2 ) ring of electrons and sulfur and oxygen ions trapped in jupiter s strong magnetic field , produced by the ionization of @xmath01 ton per second of neutral material from io s extended neutral clouds . on ionization , fresh ions tap the rotational energy of jupiter ( to which they are coupled by the magnetic field ) .",
    "much of the torus thermal energy is radiated as intense ( @xmath010@xmath3 w ) euv emissions .",
    "the @xmath0100 ev temperature of the torus ions indicates that they have lost more than half of their initial pick - up energy .",
    "electrons , on the other hand , have very little energy at the time of ionization and gain thermal energy from collisions with the ions ( as well as through other plasma processes ) while losing energy via the euv emissions that they excite .",
    "_ in situ _ measurements of the io plasma torus from the voyager , ulysses , and galileo spacecraft and remote sensing observations from the ground and from space - based uv telescopes have characterized the density , temperature and composition of the plasma as well as the basic spatial structure ( see review by @xcite ) . however , the azimuthal and temporal variability of the torus remains poorly determined .",
    "extensive measurements of torus emissions made by the ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ( uvis ) on the cassini spacecraft as it flew past jupiter on its way to saturn allow us to further examine the azimuthal structure of the plasma torus and its changes with time .",
    "analysis of torus spectral emissions provides estimates of plasma composition , temperature , and density , which can then be used to constrain models of mass and energy flow through the torus .",
    "such models can be used to derive plasma properties such as source strength , source composition , and radial transport timescale @xcite .",
    "thus , one aims to relate observations of spatial and temporal variations in torus emissions to the underlying source , loss and transport processes . towards this ultimate goal ,",
    "we present an analysis of uvis observations of the io torus from 1 october 2000 to 14 november 2000 .      in order to understand the uvis observations of azimuthal variability and periodicity , it is useful to briefly review the various jovian coordinate systems ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "jupiter has no fixed surface features on which measurements of its rotation period can be based .",
    "observations of the transits of jovian cloud features by several late 19@xmath4 century astronomers , among whom were @xcite and @xcite , led to the adoption of the `` system i '' and `` system ii '' rotation periods .",
    "the system i period , based on the rate of rotation of equatorial cloud features , was defined as 9@xmath5  50@xmath6  30.0034@xmath7 , while the system ii period , based on the more slowly rotating cloud features at high latitudes , was defined as 9@xmath5  55@xmath6  40.6322@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the prime meridians of the associated longitude grids for both coordinate systems were defined to be the central meridian longitude at greenwich noon on july 14 , 1897 .",
    "attempts to derive a rotation period based on the motion of the interior of the planet , rather than the cloud tops , met with little success until the discovery of decametric ( dam ; @xmath020 mhz ) radio emissions from jupiter by @xcite . from this radio emission",
    ", @xcite obtained the first measurement of the jovian rotation period based on the rotation of the magnetosphere .",
    "subsequent observations improved the accuracy of the rotation period derived from radio emissions , and a period of 9@xmath5  55@xmath6  29.37@xmath7the weighted average of several radio observations ",
    "was defined as the `` system iii '' ( 1957 ) rotation period @xcite . with further observations ,",
    "it gradually became clear that this period was in need of a slight revision .",
    "@xcite reported the weighted average of radio observations obtained since the system iii ( 1957 ) period was defined ; their published value of 9@xmath5  55@xmath6  29.71@xmath7 became known as system iii ( 1965 ) and was adopted by the international astronomical union ( iau ) as the standard rotation period of jupiter @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported that the system iii ( 1965 ) rotation period should be further revised to 9@xmath5  55@xmath6  29.6854@xmath7 , based on 35 years of radio observations of jupiter .",
    "this difference results in a shift of @xmath01@xmath8 in longitude every four years relative to system iii ( 1965 ) .",
    "since this shift in longitude is far less than can be measured by uvis during the jupiter encounter and since the proposed revision to the system iii period has not yet been uniformly adopted @xcite , all subsequent references to `` system iii '' , corotation , or rotation with the magnetic field , will refer to the iau accepted jovian rotation period : system iii ( 1965 ) .      for the purposes of modeling , the io plasma torus",
    "is often assumed to be azimuthally symmetric .",
    "however there have been numerous observations of the io torus that suggest that the torus exhibits significant variation with system iii longitude . here ,",
    "we present a brief review of some of these observations . an additional discussion of observations of longitudinal asymmetries can be found in @xcite .",
    "some of the earliest observations of the io plasma torus found that the brightness of the [ ] 6716/6731  doublet was correlated with system iii longitude .",
    "@xcite observed this [ ] doublet using the 5  m hale telescope on the nights of 711 october 1976 .",
    "they found that a region extending 90@xmath8 in longitude and centered on @xmath9 was consistently fainter than the rest of the torus .",
    "the [ ] brightness peaked at @xmath10 , although given the relatively large scatter in the data , this value is poorly constrained .    using the 2.2  m telescope of the mauna kea observatory , @xcite observed the [ ] 6716/6731doublet over a three month interval that began in december 1977 .",
    "the brightness of the [ ] doublet was found to vary with longitude by as much as a factor of 4 .",
    "the peak brightness was observed in the longitude range of 160@xmath11 . at other times , @xcite found the [ ] brightness to be more azimuthally uniform , with the transition between these two states taking approximately two weeks .",
    "@xcite reported a similar azimuthal variation in the brightness of the [ ] 6716/6731  doublet in widely - spaced observations between 19 january 1976 and 19 june 1979 using the mcdonald observatory s 2.7  m telescope .",
    "the brightness was found to vary by about a factor of 5 , with a peak located at @xmath12=260@xmath8 .",
    "extensive observations of the io plasma torus were made by the ultraviolet spectrometers ( uvs ) aboard the voyager 1 and voyager 2 spacecraft @xcite .",
    "the initial search for variations in the uv brightness of the torus with system iii longitude focused on the pre - encounter period of the voyager 2 spacecraft , which took place from days 116144 of 1979 @xcite . during the period of day 121/16:20 ut to day 123/14:00 ut , a weak ( @xmath1310% ) azimuthal variation in the brightness of the 685  feature was observed .",
    "this variation had a peak brightness located in the range of @xmath14 and a minimum brightness in the range of @xmath15 and was seen only in the dusk ansa of the torus .",
    "roughly two days later , during the period of day 123/18:00 ut to day 125/12:00 ut , a stronger azimuthal variation was seen in both the dawn and dusk ansae .",
    "however , the phase of the variation had shifted by @xmath060@xmath8 in longitude , such that the peak in brightness was located between @xmath16 and the minimum between @xmath17 .    a short - term variation with system iii longitude similar to that reported by @xcite has been found in spectra from the voyager 1 uvs @xcite .",
    "after analyzing 47 hours of voyager 1 uvs spectra of the io torus , @xcite found that both the electron density and electron temperature vary with system iii longitude .",
    "the electron density variation had an amplitude of about 12% with a peak near @xmath12=150@xmath8 and a minimum near @xmath12=320@xmath8 .",
    "the electron temperature variation had an amplitude of about 7% with a a peak near @xmath12=270@xmath8 and a minimum near @xmath12=80@xmath8 .    although @xcite found evidence for short - term azimuthal variations in the brightness of the 685feature , they reported no significant long - lived variation of torus brightness with system iii longitude during the 44-day voyager 2 pre - encounter period .",
    "however , such a long - lived system iii variation was found by @xcite , who used a lomb - scargle periodogram analysis @xcite to search for periodicities in the voyager 2 pre - encounter data . using similar analysis techniques ( lomb - scargle periodograms )",
    "@xcite and @xcite also discovered system iii periodicities in their observations of the torus [ ] 6731emission .",
    "imaging observations of the torus in 1981 by @xcite showed that the brightness of the [ ] 6731  line varied by a factor of 6 as a function of system iii longitude .",
    "the peak brightness was found to be at @xmath18 , although a secondary peak at @xmath19 was also evident .    also in 1981",
    ", @xcite was able to simultaneously image the [ ] 6716/6731  doublet , the [ ] 4069/4076  doublet , and the [ ] 3726/3729doublet , using the mauna kea observatory 2.2  m telescope .",
    "on observing runs that took place from 1417 february 1981 and 2023 march 1981 , @xcite found the brightness of both [ ] doublets varied with system iii longitude , with a peak at @xmath20 .",
    "however , no correlation of the brightness of the [ ] doublet with system iii longitude was apparent .",
    "@xcite made spectroscopic observations of the io torus [ ] 6716/6731  doublet on 2324 february 1981six days after the observations of @xcite  and found no obvious correlation of [ ] brightness with system iii longitude .",
    "additional imaging of the io plasma torus at the [ ] 6731emission was conducted by @xcite over six nights from 31 january 1991 to 6 february 1991 .",
    "they found the longitudes @xmath21 to be consistently @xmath034 times brighter than the longitudes @xmath22 .",
    "more detailed examination revealed that the variation of brightness with longitude was weakest on 31 january 1991 with a poorly - constrained maximum near @xmath0120@xmath8 .",
    "three nights later , the variation with longitude was significantly stronger , and the peak had shifted to a longitude of @xmath0170@xmath8 .",
    "finally , on the last night of observation ( 5 february 1991 ) , the amplitude of the longitudinal variation remained relatively large , and the peak had shifted further to a longitude of @xmath0210@xmath8 .",
    "@xcite interpreted the shift in phase of @xmath018@xmath8/day as evidence for a possible 2.1% subcorotation ( relative to rigid corotation ) of a torus feature .",
    "additionally , @xcite proposed that the modulation of the amplitude of the longitudinal variation might explain why numerous previous observations had detected an enhanced brightness of in the `` active sector '' ( a sector spanning roughly 90@xmath8 in longitude centered around @xmath23 ) : the amplitude of the variation is greatest when the peak lies within this region and is diminished when it lies outside .",
    "spectra of the io torus obtained on 1011 february 1992 showed that the brightness of the [ ] 6716/6731  doublet and the 6312  line were correlated .",
    "these spectral features peaked in brightness at a system iii longitude of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to observations of the 685  feature by the voyager 1 and voyager 2 uvs @xcite , @xcite found no correlation between the brightness of torus emission between 70760  and system iii longitude .",
    "emission from the [ ] 10.51 @xmath25 m line was discovered in observations of the io plasma torus on 25 may 1997 using the infrared space observatory @xcite .",
    "the brightness of this feature was found to vary by @xmath020% with system iii longitude with a poorly - constrained peak near @xmath26 .      in the 29 years since its discovery by @xcite ,",
    "there have been numerous observations of phenomena occurring in the io plasma torus having a period longer than the system iii rotation period .",
    "there have also been several direct measurements of the torus plasma lagging corotation with system iii . to place our results into proper context",
    ", we present a brief review of these observations .",
    "the first indications that plasma in the io torus might not be rigidly corotating with jupiter s magnetic field came from the planetary radio astronomy ( pra ) experiments aboard the two voyager spacecraft .",
    "the jovian narrow - band kilometric radiation ( nkom ) , first described by @xcite , is emitted from source regions lying in the outer io plasma torus at radial distances of @xmath089  r@xmath27 .",
    "@xcite found that the rotation period of jovian narrow - band kilometric radiation ( nkom ) source regions was 3.3% slower than the system iii rotation period during the voyager 1 encounter and 5.5% slower during the voyager 2 encounter .    the initial analysis by @xcite of the jovian nkom emissions observed by the voyager pra experiments covered only a relatively short period ( @xmath045 jovian rotations ) during each spacecraft encounter . a statistical analysis of all detections of nkom by both voyager pra experiments between 14 january 1979 and 31 december 1979 ( the period when the spacecraft were within 900  r@xmath27 of jupiter ) found that the rotation period of the nkom sources was not constant @xcite .",
    "rather , the rotation periods for individual nkom sources varied between 08% longer than the system iii rotation period with average values of 3.2% and 2.7% for voyager 1 and voyager 2 , respectively .",
    "the large range of values reflects intrinsic variability in the rotation period of the nkom sources rather than errors in measurement , which are estimated to be @xmath01% . although the rotation period of individual nkom sources generally lagged the system iii rotation period , the probability of observing nkom emission was found to be significantly greater when the spacecraft were at system iii longitudes of 40@xmath8 and 300@xmath8 .",
    "the order of magnitude greater sensitivity and direction - finding capabilities of the unified radio and plasma wave instrument ( urap ) on the ulysses spacecraft allowed the detection of six distinct nkom source regions during the ulysses encounter with jupiter in february , 1992 @xcite .",
    "these source regions were found to lie at radial distances of 7.010.0 r@xmath27 and to have a rotation periods ranging from 3.08.6% greater than the system iii period ( again the range in values represents the variability of the individual nkom sources , rather than measurement uncertainty ) .",
    "in addition , to the subcorotation period of nkom source regions , urap also detected a new component of the jovian hectometer radiation ( hom ) that recurs with a period 24% longer than the system iii rotation period @xcite .",
    "reexamination of voyager 1 and voyager 2 pra data found similar results .",
    "based partly on the spectroscopic observations of @xcite , which were concurrent with the ulysses encounter , @xcite conclude that the new hom component is the result of an hom source region in the high - latitude regions of jupiter being periodically blocked by a high - density region in the io torus .      _ in situ _ measurements of the bulk rotation velocity of the torus plasma have been made by the plasma science ( pls ) instruments aboard the voyager 1 and galileo spacecraft and the urap instrument aboard the ulysses spacecraft .",
    "the voyager 1 pls found that the torus plasma was within a couple percent of rigid corotation inside of 5.7  r@xmath27 , but between 5.910 r@xmath27 , deviations from corotation of up to 10% could not be ruled out @xcite .",
    "the ulysses urap instrument measured two components of the dc electric field during its fly - through of the outer io torus , and from this derived the flow speed of torus plasma @xcite .",
    "urap found the plasma flow speeds to be generally close to corotation but with significant deviations having an rms value of 5.3 km / s .",
    "finally , on five passes through the io torus , the galileo pls observed that the bulk plasma flow lagged the corotation velocity by 210 km / s , with an average deviation of @xmath023 km / s @xcite .",
    "the first direct observation of a corotational lag in the io torus plasma came from analysis of the doppler shift of the [ ]  6716  /6731    doublet @xcite . using observations from two nights in february , 1981 and three nights in april , 1981 , @xcite found that the radial velocity of deviated from rigid corotation by 6%@xmath284% , where the @xmath284% represents the variability of the derived corotation lag , rather than the measurement uncertainty .",
    "observations of [ ]  9531    emitted from the dusk side of the torus between 12 april 1982 and 30 april 1982 found that the torus brightness was not correlated with the system iii rotation period , but rather with a period of 10.2@xmath280.1 hours , 2.8% longer than the system iii period @xcite .",
    "these observations were obtained between 12 april 1982 and 30 april 1982 using a scanning fabry - perot spectrometer that had a field of view 2  r@xmath27 in diameter centered at a radial distance of 6  r@xmath27 .",
    "this was the first detection of a long - lived ( roughly 43 rotations of jupiter ) periodic phenomenon in the io torus at a period other than system iii .",
    "a reanalysis of this data by @xcite confirmed the existence of a 10.20  hour periodicity in the data and found a statistically significant secondary periodicity at the system iii rotation period .",
    "additional ground - based observations of [ ]  9531  and [ ]  6731    emission from the io torus in march and april , 1981 by @xcite and @xcite were interpreted as requiring a torus rotation period a few percent longer than system iii , consistent with @xcite .",
    "the reported subcorotation of the nkom source regions @xcite , the 10.2-hour periodicity in the brightness of [ ]  9531  @xcite , and analysis of voyager ultraviolet spectrometer ( uvs ) data @xcite , led @xcite to propose a new jovian coordinate system known as `` system iv '' that rotates 3.1% slower than system iii .",
    "the proposed system iv coordinate system was further refined by @xcite . using a lomb - scargle periodogram analysis of the brightness of the voyager 2 uvs 685    feature , ( a feature dominated by three multiplets of though also containing emissions from and )",
    ", @xcite found evidence for periodicity at both the system iii period , and at a period of 10.224 hours , 3.0% longer than system iii .",
    "in addition , @xcite noted that the azimuthal variation in brightness was greatest when these two periods were aligned .",
    "the observed period of 10.224 was used to define the system iv ( 1979 ) coordinate system .",
    "the prime meridian of the system iv ( 1979 ) coordinate system was defined such that the peak of the 685  emissions occurred near @xmath29=180@xmath8 .",
    "recent analysis of 47 hours of voyager 1 uvs spectra of the io torus by @xcite found both electron density and electron temperature to be organized in system iv longitude . however , the uncertainty in these quantities is larger than the observed system iv modulation .",
    "the first observational program designed specifically to look for periodicities in the io torus was undertaken in 1988 @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed emission of [ ]  6731  from the io torus over a 35 day period using a fabry - perot spectrometer similar to that used by @xcite . after careful analysis of their data using weighted lomb - scargle periodograms , they found periodicity in the torus [ ] intensity at 10.14@xmath280.03 hours  a period intermediate of system iii and system iv  and at 9.95 hours , consistent with the system iii period .    in an effort to address the apparent inconsistencies between the previous spectroscopic measurements",
    ", @xcite observed the [ ] doublet at 6717  and 6731  over a six month period in 1992 using a long - slit echelle spectrograph .",
    "to date , this remains the longest time baseline of torus observations , and it thus provides the most accurate measurement of the periodicities in the torus . using the now ubiquitous lomb - scargle periodogram analysis , @xcite found significant periodicity in the torus at both the system iii period and a period of 10.214@xmath280.006 hours2.91% longer than the system iii period .",
    "the latter period was found to remain constant between the radial distances of 5.875 and 6.750 r@xmath27 and provides the basis for a minor revision to the system iv ( 1979 ) coordinate system known as system iv ( 1992 ) .",
    "subsequent references to `` system iv '' will refer to the system iv ( 1992 ) period defined by @xcite .    during the observing period ,",
    "the variation of [ ] line brightness with system iv longitude underwent a sudden phase shift of @xmath0100@xmath8 . the sudden shift in phase resulted in a spurious weak peak in the dawn ansa periodogram at a period of 10.16 hours  quite similar to the value reported by @xcite . by subdividing the data into two groups ( before and after the sudden phase shift )",
    "the peak in the dawn ansa periodogram becomes 10.217@xmath280.010 hours , consistent with the value of 10.214@xmath280.006 hours obtained from the dusk ansa . in light of the discovery that the phase of system iv variations can shift rapidly , @xcite reanalyzed their 1988 data and found a similar phase shift was responsible for the reported periodicity of 10.14@xmath280.03 hours . by subdividing their data into two groups they found that the primary periodicity in the data was , in fact , at 10.2 hours , consistent with the system iv period .",
    "direct measurements of the radial velocity of the torus plasma as a function of radial distance were obtained by measuring the doppler shift in the sum of all 222 spectra obtained in 1992 @xcite .",
    "the torus plasma was found to lag rigid corotation with system iii , with the amount of corotational lag being a strong function of radial distance .",
    "the corotational lag reached a maximum deviation of @xmath04 km / s in the range of 66.5  r@xmath27 . between 67  r@xmath27 ,",
    "the torus lags corotation by an average of 2% .",
    "this measurement , coupled with the observation that the system iv period remained constant between 5.875 and 6.75 r@xmath27 , led @xcite to conclude that the system iv periodicity can not be caused by plasma lagging corotation .",
    "the radial velocity profile of the io torus was measured again in october 1999 using the 3.5  m european southern observatory s new technology telescope ( ntt ) @xcite .",
    "the radial velocities derived from and emission lines were in good agreement with the range in velocities measured by @xcite and @xcite , however the larger collecting area of the ntt telescope enabled @xcite to place much smaller relative error bars on their radial velocity profiles .",
    "the radial velocity measurements of @xcite represent a snapshot of the io torus radial velocity profile ( they were derived from a single integration ) whereas the radial velocity profile of @xcite represents the average profile over a six - month period .",
    "finally , a multi - year campaign to determine the long - term variability of torus [ ] 6731  and 6716  emissions has been carried out by @xcite . using small telescopes ( diameters of 28  cm and 35  cm ) ,",
    "@xcite obtained data in four observing seasons between 1997 and 2000 .",
    "using lomb - scargle periodogram analysis , they found periodicities of 10.18@xmath280.06 hours in 1998 , 10.29@xmath280.14 hours in 1999 , and 10.14@xmath280.11 hours in 2000 , all within measurement uncertainty of the 10.214 hour system iv period .",
    "data from the 2000 observing season were acquired between 15 december 2000 and 5 january 2001 , concurrent with the cassini spacecraft s closest approach with jupiter , but more than 30 days after the data presented in this paper were acquired .",
    "the data used in this paper were obtained by the cassini spacecraft s ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ( uvis ) @xcite between 1 october 2000 and 15 november 2000 ( doy 275320 ) during the inbound leg of cassini s jupiter flyby . during this period , while the spacecraft was between 1100  r@xmath27 and 600  r@xmath27 from the planet ( 1  r@xmath27=71,492 km ) , 1904 spectrally - dispersed images of the io torus , in its entirety , were acquired .",
    "all of these spectral images have an integration time of 1000 seconds .",
    "the duty cycle for uvis consisted of six 20-hour blocks . during blocks 1 , 2 , 5 , and",
    "6 uvis observed the io torus for 9 consecutive hours followed by 11 hours of downlink and observations of other targets .",
    "blocks 3 and 4 consisted of 28 hours of torus observation followed by 12 hours of downlink and other observations .",
    "this cycle was repeated nine times .",
    "additional information about this dataset , including examples of the observing geometry , images of the raw and processed data , and descriptions of the data reduction and calibration procedures used , can be found in @xcite .",
    "since the encounter distances were so large , the spatial resolution of this dataset is relatively coarse ( 0.61.1  r@xmath27 per detector row ) .",
    "we therefore limited our analysis to spectra from the ansa region on both sides ( dawn and dusk ) of the torus .",
    "the ansa region was defined as the part of the torus subtended by the brightest row on the detector , plus the two neighboring rows .",
    "spectra contained in these three rows were averaged together to obtain the ansa spectrum .",
    "the decreasing distance of the cassini spacecraft to jupiter during the observation period meant that the range of projected radial distances in the io torus from which the ansa spectra were extracted went from 4.58.0  r@xmath27 on 1 october 2000 to 5.27.0  r@xmath27 on 15 november 2000 .",
    "the io torus spectral model described in @xcite was used to derive the ion composition , electron temperature , and electron column density from the spectra extracted from each ansa of the torus .",
    "spectra from the dawn and dusk ansae of the torus are fit independently of each other and yield statistically identical results . for clarity of presentation ,",
    "all figures ( with the exception of fig .",
    "[ ne_te_vs_sys3 ] ) show results from only one of the torus ansae .",
    "since the long axis of the uvis entrance slit was oriented parallel to the jovian equator , information about the latitudinal distribution of the io torus is convolved with spectral information along the dispersion direction of the detector . to separate theses",
    "effects , we assume a gaussian scale height for the torus plasma , the value of which is a parameter fit by the model . additionally , we assume that the scale heights for all ion species present in the torus are equal .",
    "although this last assumption is somewhat unphysical , given the relatively coarse spatial resolution of the uvis dataset , it has no significant effect on our results .",
    "figure  [ p3_mix_vs_time ] shows how the mixing ratios ( ion density divided by electron density ) of four ion species in the torus : , , , and , and electron temperature vary with time during the observation period .",
    "the most obvious long - term change is that the mixing ratio of falls from 0.10 to 0.05 over a 45-day timescale , while the mixing ratio of increases from 0.02 to 0.05 over the same period . the mixing ratios of and , the two dominant ion species in the torus , remain relatively constant .",
    "the temporal changes in the composition of the torus plasma coupled with observations by the galileo dust detector system of a four - orders - of - magnitude increase in the amount of dust emitted from io @xcite led @xcite to propose a factor of 34 increase in the amount of neutral material available to the torus on , or around , 4 september 2000 .",
    "torus chemistry models including such an increase in the neutral source rate ( along with a corresponding increase in the amount of hot electrons in the torus ) can closely match the observed changes in plasma composition with time .    ]      over the 45-day inbound staring period , the long - term variations of torus parameters with system iii longitude are relatively small .",
    "the relative variation of the euv luminosity of the torus ansae with system iii longitude is only about 5% , with a maximum near @xmath12=120@xmath8 and a secondary peak near @xmath12=270@xmath8 @xcite ) .",
    "the relative variations of electron density and electron temperature with system iii longitude are shown in fig .  [ ne_te_vs_sys3 ] . like the euv luminosity ,",
    "both electron density and electron temperature show long - tern variations of only @xmath05% .",
    "in contrast , however , the variations of both electron density and electron temperature show a single , clearly defined peak with a single , clearly defined minimum .",
    "although there is a large amount of scatter in the individual data points , the average variation in electron density is clearly anti - correlated with the average variation in electron temperature : the electron density has a maximum value near @xmath12=160@xmath8 , while the electron temperature has a minimum value near @xmath12=170@xmath8 .     longitude bins .",

    "if the 10.07 hour periodicity in the uvis data were produced directly by the subcorotation of torus plasma , the plasma , when averaged over the uvis field of view and weighted by its euv emissions , would need to lag the local corotation velocity by 1.5% ( @xmath00.19 km / s / r@xmath27 ) . in order to maximize signal - to - noise in the torus spectra , spectra from three rows on the detector",

    "since there are also theoretical arguments against producing such periodicities in the torus directly from plasma subcorotation , i.e. that energy must be supplied continuously to the torus in just the right place and amount to keep the pattern coherent despite the changes in radial distance @xcite , we consider this possibility unlikely .    instead , the uvis observations are entirely consistent with the theory proposed by @xcite that the system iv periodicity is the result of the pattern speed of a compositional wave propagating through the io torus . while the individual particles of the torus lag corotation by an amount appropriate for their radial distance , the group velocity of the compositional wave lags rigid corotation by 1.5% .",

    "whose amplitude is modulated by its position relative to system iii longitude , several apparently contradictory observations of the io torus can be explained .",

    "the @xmath014 day modulation period of the amplitude of the azimuthal compositional variation also explains why @xcite observed a strong azimuthal variation in the brightness of the torus [ ] 6731  emission with a peak near @xmath62 during the period of 1417 february 1981 , while @xcite detected no significant azimuthal variation in the same emission line on 2324 february 1981 .",
    "furthermore , the subcorotation and amplitude modulation of the azimuthal variation in composition explains why the voyager 2 uvs observed only a weak azimuthal variation in the brightness of the 685  feature with a peak between @xmath14 on day 122 of 1979 ( the amplitude of the azimuthal variation was at a minimum ) , a stronger azimuthal variation ( the azimuthal variation had reached it s minimum amplitude with the peak near 20@xmath59 and was increasing in amplitude ) with a peak between @xmath63 on day 124 of 1979 ( assuming the azimuthal pattern had the 10.2 hour system iv period , the phase should increase by @xmath024@xmath8/day ) , and no significant system iii variation when the spectra were averaged over the 44 day pre - encounter period ( the system iii longitude of the peak varies with time ) .",
    "whereas the failure of @xcite to detect any significant variation in the brightness of torus emissions with system iii longitude results from the averaging of euve data obtained during the interval from 1924 june 1996 . during this time",
    ", the peak of the azimuthal variation would have shifted by over 120@xmath59 in system iii longitude .    finally , it is also interesting to note that the two largest torus euv luminosity events reported by @xcite occurred on days 280 and 307 , near the modulation peaks . during these events , which last for roughly 20 hours ,",
    "the power radiated by the io torus in the euv increases rapidly by @xmath0 20% before gradually returning to the pre - event level . since several other brightening events occurred throughout the 45-day observing period , the timing of the two largest events may be coincidental .",
    "the next step is to model the uvis observations by extending the torus chemistry model of @xcite .",
    "preliminary results suggest that the interaction of a subcorotating ( at 10.07 hours ) , azimuthally - varying source of hot ( @xmath055 ev ) electrons with a corotating ( i.e. fixed in system iii ) , azimuthally - varying source of hot electrons can produce torus behavior that is both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the uvis observations .",
    "the 28.8 day modulation period arises naturally from the beating of the 10.07 hour period with the 9.925 hour system iii period . while it is not too difficult to imagine a source mechanism capable of producing hot electrons in amounts that vary as a function of system iii longitude , it is far from obvious what could cause an additional , azimuthally - varying pattern of hot electrons to rotate with a period 13% slower than the system iii period . at present we know of no suitable physical mechanism capable of producing such behavior .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the temporal and azimuthal variability of the io plasma torus during the cassini encounter with jupiter .",
    "our main conclusions are :    1 .",
    "the torus exhibited significant long - term compositional changes during the uvis inbound observing period .",
    "these compositional changes are consistent with models predicting a factor of 34 increase in the amount of neutral material supplied to the torus in early september , 2000 . these results are discussed in more detail by @xcite .",
    "2 .   persistent azimuthal variability in torus ion mixing ratios , electron temperature , and equatorial electron column density was observed .",
    "the azimuthal variations in , , and electron column density mixing ratios are all approximately in phase with each other .",
    "the mixing ratios of and and the torus equatorial electron temperature are also approximately in phase with each other , and as a group , are approximately 180@xmath8 out of phase with the variations of , , and equatorial electron column density .",
    "the phase of the observed azimuthal variation in torus composition drifts 12.2@xmath8/day , relative to system iii longitude .",
    "this implies a period of 10.07 hours , 1.5% longer than the system iii rotation period .",
    "this period is confirmed by lomb - scargle periodogram analysis of the uvis data .",
    "the relative amplitude of the azimuthal variation in composition is greater for and .",
    "these species have relative amplitudes that vary between 525% over the observing period .",
    "the major ion species , and , have relative amplitudes that remain in the range of 25% .",
    "the amplitude of the azimuthal compositional variation appears to be modulated by its position relative to system iii longitude such that when the peak in mixing ratio is aligned with a system iii longitude of 210@xmath2815@xmath8 the amplitude is enhanced , and when the peak in mixing ratio is aligned with a system iii longitude of 30@xmath2815@xmath8 the amplitude is diminished .",
