    "to investigate this idea quantitatively , we apply standard leptonic synchrotron and inverse - compton ( ic ) modeling to the radio spectra of the lobes , investigating whether the extrapolation of the high - energy emission continuum may account for the gev flux from the system . in the ic calculations we consider seed photons provided by the cosmic background radiation , the observed ir  to  optical emission of the galactic disk , as well as the uv  to  hard x - ray photon field due to the active nucleus , corrected for obscuration ( assuming the intrinsic uv emission of the accretion disk @xmath57ergs@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the departures from the minimum energy condition @xmath79 , which may enhance the expected ic radiation for a given synchrotron ( radio ) flux , are often claimed for lobes in radio galaxies and quasars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in the particular case of circinus",
    ", however , the effect would have to be extreme in order to account for the flux detected with the lat , @xmath80 .",
    "although we can not exclude this possibility , we consider it rather unlikely .",
    "deep , high - resolution x - ray observations could in principle be used in the near future to validate the @xmath79 hypothesis for the circinus lobes , but at this moment the very limited photon statistics of the available _ chandra _ maps precludes any robust detection of a non - thermal lobe - related emission component at kev photon energies .",
    "we note however that the ic model curve calculated for @xmath81 and shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] is below the corresponding upper limits .",
