    "the present work has two main objectives . on the one hand",
    ", we establish the reliability of the recently introduced scattering - states numerical renormalization group ( snrg ) approach@xcite to quantum transport by comparing results for small values of @xmath0 to the diagrammatic kadanoff - baym - keldysh approach , which becomes exact in the limit @xmath1 . on the other hand",
    ", we will discuss discrepancies and reveal shortcomings of those diagrammatic approaches at intermediate values of the charging energy .",

    "but quantum - impurity models@xcite commonly used in the theory of quantum transport on the molecular level often exhibit infra - red divergences in perturbation theory@xcite which also restrict the diagrammatic keldysh approaches to certain parameter regimes usually to high temperature or to large bias .",

    "currents have been extracted from time - dependent density matrix renormalization group@xcite calculations using finite 1d wires , and the results agree well with bethe ansatz results for certain models.@xcite quantum monte carlo approaches based on scattering states@xcite can access the intermediate coupling regime@xcite at finite bias .",
    "recent real - time formulations of continuous - time quantum monte carlo@xcite and an iterative real - time path integral approach@xcite to quantum transport offer the appealing advantage of working directly in the continuum limit , but are confined to relatively short time scales .",
    "access to low temperatures and long times is hampered in the former case by a severe sign problem , and by the extrapolation to long memory times in the latter case .",
    "hence neither approach can presently be applied to nonequilibrium dynamics of correlated systems with a small underlying energy scale , as is the case with ultra - small quantum dots when tuned to the kondo regime .",
    "the usage of lippmann - schwinger scattering states has been well established in quantum - field theory@xcite for over 50 years and also successfully adapted to the description of quantum transport through strongly interacting nano - devices coupled to ballistic leads.@xcite these states fulfill the correct boundary condition of the open quantum system : ( i ) they break time - reversal symmetry and , therefore , are ( ii ) complex and current - carrying and ( iii ) describe ballistic transport in the leads combined with scattering events in the small interacting quantum - dot region .",
    "this time - reversal symmetry breaking is required for current carrying systems and reveals itself naturally in all diagrammatic approaches by the occurrence of retarded and advanced green s functions .",
    "it is a consequence of any regularization when performing the limit to an infinitely large system .",
    "in particular , the work of hershfield @xcite and doyon and andrei @xcite has rigorously shown that these boundary conditions remain unaltered when a local interaction is switched on .",
    "the noninteracting current - carrying system evolves into the new steady - state of the _ interacting _ system , and the steady - state density operator retains a boltzmannian form.@xcite the explicit construction of those scattering states allows to exactly solve the dc and ac kondo model at the toulouse point@xcite as well as the interacting resonant level model.@xcite    recently , an extension@xcite to wilson s numerical renormalization group has been developed for steady - state quantum transport through nano - devices which is able to deal with the crossover from weak to strong coupling for arbitrary bias voltages .",
    "it is based on oguri s idea@xcite of discretizing the single - particle scattering states which are the solutions of the lippman - schwinger equation@xcite for the noninteracting problem and , therefore , fulfill the correct boundary condition of an open quantum system .",

    "the rescaled current is very close to its values from the symmetric junction and the discrepancies between the 2ba , gwa and snrg follow the already discussed characteristics : the 2ba underestimates correlations and yields a slightly too large current .",
    "the gwa has the correct distribution of spectral weight in the bias window and produces a rather good estimate for the current , despite its deficiencies in the description of the single - particle spectra .",
    "the failure to produce the correct shifts of spectral weights in @xmath265 causes the current in the diagrammatic approaches to be smaller than the snrg for negative voltages .",

    "all differences in the spectral functions of the presented approaches are given by the known discrepancies already present in equilibrium .",
    "in the recently developed snrg approach to open quantum systems the scattering states of a noninteracting quantum impurity model are used to construct the nonequilibrium green s functions for the steady state at finite bias voltage .",
    "we have established the reliability of the snrg by benchmarking it against the diagrammatic kadanoff - baym - keldysh approach , which becomes exact in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "it has been shown that the spectra and the current - voltage characteristics agree excellently for small coulomb interactions for symmetric and asymmetric junctions at arbitrary bias voltage .    for intermediate values of @xmath0",
    "we have compared the snrg to three different approximations obtained from the keldysh approach , namely the second - order perturbation theory ( @xmath142 ) , the fully self - consistent second - order ( 2ba ) and the gw approximation ( gwa ) . as correlation effects",
    "play an increasingly important role discrepancies occur between the different methods .",
    "these were explained by the insufficient treatment of the coulomb interaction within the diagrammatic approaches .",
    "the fermi liquid at zero bias voltages is characterized by a single low - energy scale which is captured accurately by the snrg , but is not properly reproduced by the diagrammatic approaches .",
    "no single low - energy scale can be extracted from the @xmath142 approximation and the gwa at intermediate and large @xmath0 .",
    "while the scale associated with charge fluctuations decreases with increasing @xmath0 , the magnetic scale exhibits a qualitatively different @xmath0-dependency , since it develops a minimum for intermediate @xmath0 and increases again towards larger @xmath0 ! the gwa shows a tendency to over - screen magnetic moments for increasing values of @xmath0 and fails to reproduce the atomic limit .",
    "these deficiencies translate themselves to finite bias and explain the discrepancies at small to intermediate voltages .    at large bias",
    "voltages the self - consistent diagrammatic approaches ( 2ba and gwa ) reproduce the snrg spectral functions for a symmetric junction , while the second - order perturbation theory yields an unphysical plateau around the fermi level .",
    "all diagrammatic approximations and the snrg capture the onset of the coulomb blockade in the iv characteristics of the symmetric junction .",
    "the small discrepancies are explained by the deficiencies in the treatment of the interaction .",
    "however , the failure of the @xmath142 approximation to correctly describe the single - particle dynamics at large bias is masked in the current , since there only the total spectral weight in the bias window enters .",
    "in contrast to the other methods , the @xmath142 approximation reveals its non - conserving nature by producing a finite leakage current for an asymmetric junction , which is unphysical .",
    "this raises the question about the reliability of the results obtained within that method or extensions of it,@xcite even for a symmetric junction .",
    "they are only well - justified for cases where @xmath324 for all frequencies .",
    "the voltage dependent redistribution of spectral weight for an asymmetric junction is not well - reproduced by the diagrammatic approaches .",
    "this has been attributed to too large hartree shifts due to the wrong occupation number of the impurity and the inaccurate renormalization of the single - particle level in intermediate - valence situations .",
    "it leads to the underestimation of the current for large negative voltages .",
    "the snrg provides access to the description of nonequilibrium steady - state properties of nanoscale junctions for arbitrary coulomb interaction and voltages .",
