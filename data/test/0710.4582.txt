    "@xcite first highlighted that dwarf satellites of large galaxies tend to be gas deficient compared to isolated dwarfs .",
    "the former generally have little or no ongoing star formation and the stars are pressure supported ( dwarf spheroidal , dsph ) .",
    "the latter generally have ongoing star formation and the gas dynamics show that rotational support is important ( dwarf irregular , dirr ) .",
    "`` transition '' dwarfs are gas - rich and , unlike dirr galaxies , have little or no detectable hii regions , although they usually show indications of recent star formation .    the processes by which dwarf galaxies loose their gas are not fully understood .",
    "internal feedback , particularly winds from supernovae , are likely important ( @xcite ) and the existence of the position - morphology relation clearly indicates that environmental influences are significant .",
    "@xcite show that it is possible for dwarf galaxies to be ram pressure stripped of some of their gaseous component in a hot halo of the milky way or m31 .",
    "this idea was originally proposed by @xcite , who calculated the density of the medium required to be of order @xmath2@xmath1 .",
    "there have been no direct detections of such a medium , although recently @xcite and @xcite have detected ovi absorption which they attribute to hot gas associated with either a milky way corona or a local group medium .    in this _",
    ", we compare the stellar and gaseous structure of the isolated , transition - type , dwarf galaxy pegasus ( ddo216 ) .",

    "on the night of 8 august 2003 , we obtained johnson v ( @xmath4 ) and gunn i ( @xmath5 ) photometry of pegasus with the wide field camera ( wfc ) on the 2.5meter isaac newton telescope ( int ) , a mosaic of four ccds with a total field of view of @xmath6arcmins .",
    "this is large enough that the entire dwarf galaxy is contained within a single pointing .",
    "the seeing was typically @xmath7 and exposure times of 1000 seconds in each filter allowed us to reach @xmath8mags and @xmath9 with a signal - to - noise @xmath10 .",
    "these data were previously presented in @xcite , to which we refer the reader for more details . in the central regions of pegasus ,",
    "crowding is severe and the photometry is very incomplete ; however , this makes no difference to any of the results in this _",
    "letter_.    the top - left panel of figure  1 shows the reduced @xmath4 image of pegasus taken with the intwfc .",
    "also shown are the fields of view of previous studies of pegasus . in particular , the wiyn and hst wfpc2 fields analysed in @xcite are shown in green as the largest rectangular field and the small wfpc2 footprint ; the not field analysed by @xcite",
    "is shown in blue as the smallest rectangular field , and the field studied by @xcite using the 1.5 m palomar telescope is shown in red as the medium sized rectangle . as we show below , the extent of pegasus is significantly larger than has previously been recognised .",
    "low resolution hi data for pegasus was presented in @xcite and was obtained using the very large array ( vla ) with 2.2 hours in the d array on 13 march 1995 and 12.7 hours in the c array on 24 january 1999 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details of the data reduction procedures .",
    "the top - right panel of figure  1 shows the tangent - plane projection of the spatial distribution of objects identified as stellar from our int  wfc observations of pegasus .",
    "the dotted lines in this panel ( and the remaining panels of figure  1 ) correspond to the approximate edges of each ccd of the int  wfc .",
    "only objects which lie within @xmath11 of the stellar locus in both the @xmath4 and @xmath12band observations are shown .",
    "the hole at the center of the main body of pegasus is due to severe crowding which causes incompleteness .",
    "the bottom - left panel of figure  1 shows a contour map of the density distribution of stars .",
    "the first contour is @xmath13 above the background , and the contours correspond to @xmath14 and @xmath15starsarcmin@xmath16 .",
    "the contour map was made in the standard way and follows exactly the methodology described in @xcite .",
    "this panel shows that pegasus is significantly more extended than suggested by the image in the first panel .",
    "the bottom - right panel of figure  1 shows the stellar density distribution as a grey - scale with square - root scaling .",
    "the red contours are the low - resolution hi distribution from @xcite .",
    "the contours correspond to column densities of @xmath17 and @xmath18cm@xmath16 .",
    "whereas the stars are distributed in a regular ellipse ( typical of a flattened spheroid or an inclined disk ) the hi has a `` cometary '' appearance ; the contours in the south - east are more closely packed and do not extend as far as in the north - west .",
    "the shape of the low resolution hi contours in pegasus - the smooth , compressed contours in the south - east and the `` tail '' to the north - west - is very similar to the simulated morphology of gas undergoing ram pressure striping ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , the m81 group dwarf galaxy holmberg  ii is observed to have a similar morphology ( @xcite ) , interpreted as evidence of an intra - group medium . in clusters of galaxies ,",
    "ram pressure stripping of galaxies by an intra - cluster medium is used to explain various observations , including the deficit of hi in cluster spiral galaxies compared to field spirals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , several individual galaxies in the virgo cluster have been shown to display gaseous morphologies indicative of ram - pressure stripping ( @xcite ) .",
    "what else could explain the peculiar appearance of pegasus ?",
    "while tidal stripping by large galaxies can affect the structure of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the closest large galaxy to pegasus is m31 at @xmath20kpc ( all the distance estimates in table  1 place pegasus at @xmath21kpc from m31 ) . even if we assume pegasus is a weakly - bound satellite of m31 , tidal effects at this distance are minimal . if pegasus was disrupted at pericenter , it is unlikely that the gas would still show signs of current disturbance .",
    "further , tidal stripping tends to produce symmetrical distortions and both gas and stars should be affected",
    ". however , these are inconsistent with the structure of pegasus that we observe .",
    "could the appearance of pegasus be due to internal effects rather than external influences ?",
    "enhanced star formation in the south - east of pegasus could produce winds which remove gas from this region .",
    "however , if this is the case then the densely packed contours in the south - east should have a more concave , rather than convex , shape .",
    "for example , @xcite discuss a gas cloud associated with the phoenix dwarf galaxy and conclude that it was blown out by supernovae winds based in part on the concave shape of its contours .",
    "an alternative explanation for the hi morphology of pegasus is that it consists of multiple hi clouds , the sum total of which has a cometary appearance .",
    "figure  6 of @xcite is a position - velocity diagram of pegasus along its major axis .",
    "it shows a gradient in velocity and two main concentrations of hi which @xcite interpret as two distinct hi clouds .",
    "the strength of the secondary feature ( @xmath22kms@xmath23 ) is weaker than the main feature ( @xmath24kms@xmath23 ) and they join at relatively high column density ( between the @xmath25 contour levels ) .",
    "an alternative explanation of the data is that the overall velocity gradient is a result of ram - pressure stripping .",
    "the velocity difference between the two features may be due to stripped gas leaving a `` hole '' in the distribution , making the secondary feature appear at a higher density than its immediate surroundings ( we do not necessarily expect that the column density should smoothly vary over the entire cloud ) .",
    "henceforth , we adopt the hypothesis that pegasus is being ram pressure stripped . following @xcite , material will be ram pressure stripped from a galaxy if the density of the surrounding medium , @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the total surface density ( stars plus gas ) , @xmath28 is the column density of hi and @xmath29 is the relative velocity of the galaxy to the medium .",
    "thus ,    @xmath30    where we take the mean particle mass @xmath31 for fully ionized media .",
    "we approximate the local group space velocity of pegasus as @xmath32kms@xmath23 where @xmath33kms@xmath23 is the local group line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( @xcite ) .",
    "hi at a column density much lower than @xmath34cm@xmath16 has been stripped from pegasus , implying that this is a reasonable lower limit for use in this calculation .",
    "we adopt @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the stellar mass of pegasus ( table  1 ) .",
    "this seems reasonable ; the surface brightness of pegasus is @xmath37magsarcsec@xmath16 at a radius of @xmath38 on the minor axis ( @xcite ) , corresponding to a stellar surface density of @xmath39cm@xmath16 .",
    "this is approximately equivalent to the stellar - to - gas mass ratio multiplied by the gas surface density ( @xmath40 ) at @xmath38 .",
    "these values yield @xmath41@xmath1 . however , given the uncertainties involved , it is entirely plausible that the value of @xmath42 could be at least an order of magnitude larger than in equation  1 .      what is the source of the material that is stripping pegasus ?",
    "the bottom right panel of figure  1 shows the distances of pegasus to its nearest gas - rich neighbours .",
    "the dwarf neighbours are unlikely to be the source of the stripping medium ; not only is the required mass of gas unrealistically large ( an ejected spherical shell @xmath43kpc thick with a radius of @xmath44kpc would have a mass @xmath45 at a density of @xmath42 ) but the energy required is too large for a dwarf galaxy to reasonably provide .    alternatively , the gas could be associated with m31 . from observations of the magellanic stream , @xcite estimate that the density of the milky way halo at the stream must be @xmath46@xmath1 , although @xcite estimate @xmath47 @xmath1 .",
    "if the gas density in the halo of m31 is similar , then not only would m31 need to have a very extended corona , but its density would need to decrease very slowly with radius . indeed , if the milky way has a similarly extended corona , then the two will overlap and the result may be observationally indistinguishable from a local group medium .",
    "the isolation of pegasus raises the strong possibility that the stripping medium is associated with the local group , rather than individual galaxies within the group .",
    "clusters of galaxies have such media , and observations of holmberg  ii imply the presence of an intra - group medium in the m81 group ( @xcite ) .",
    "the density of the intra - group medium implied in equation  1 is of the same order as the density of the medium responsible for local ovi absorption detected by @xcite and @xcite , which they suggest is associated with either a milky way corona or a local group medium .",
    "our result favors the latter interpretation .",
    "theoretically , @xmath48 of baryons in the local volume are expected to be in a warm / hot phase ( @xmath49k ; @xcite ) ; this is likely concentrated around galaxies and galaxy groups as an intra - group medium .",
    "if the stripping medium pervades the local group , why do more dwarf galaxies not show evidence of ram pressure stripping ?",
    "@xcite suggest that all the dsphs have been stripped in this fashion , ( although @xcite show that ram - pressure stripping by itself is insufficient to remove all the gas from a dirr ) .",
    "it is possible that the local group medium will be clumpy and perhaps pegasus is passing through a region of higher density compared to other dirrs .",
    "alternatively , pegasus could be falling into and interacting with the local group for the first time , as has recently been speculated for two dsph galaxies at large radii from m31 ( and  xii , @xcite ; andxiv , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the reason why only pegasus currently shows signs of ram - pressure stripping is unlikely to be known until such time as the masses and orbits of the dirrs have been determined .",
    "given the distances of these galaxies , this will be some time yet .",
    "we show that the isolated , transition - type , local group dwarf galaxy , pegasus ( ddo216 ) is undergoing ram pressure stripping . we calculate that the density of the medium required to strip pegasus is at least @xmath50@xmath51 , of the same order as the medium recently identified by @xcite and @xcite through ovi absorption . given the large distance of pegasus from either the milky way or m31 ,",
