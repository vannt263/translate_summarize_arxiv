    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) for electron correlation was originally developed in the context of the many - body perturbation treatment of the uniform electron gas @xcite and later reformulated in the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) via the adiabatic - connection fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite . in the last years , rpa correlation witnessed an increasing interest in quantum chemistry @xcite , due to its ability to describe with good accuracy a rather large variety of reaction and interaction energies . in this context rpa",
    "is generally employed as a post kohn - sham ( ks ) approach where the exact exchange ( exx ) and the correlation energies are evaluated using the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions from a ks calculation with conventional exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals .",
    "exx ks orbitals @xcite have been also employed via the optimized effective potential ( oep ) method , while for a fully variational approach self - consistent exx - rpa orbitals are required @xcite . in all cases",
    "practical applications of the method are often hindered by the the very slow convergence of the rpa - correlation energy with the basis set dimension @xcite , which is related to the electron cusp problem @xcite , in analogy with wavefunction methods .",
    "the cusp problem is strongly reduced for range - separated rpa @xcite , whereas for full - range rpa approaches extrapolation to the complete basis set ( cbs ) must be employed .",
    "basis set extrapolation to the cbs limit has been longley studied for post hartree - fock correlated methods , with the aim of reducing as much as possible the basis set truncation error without resorting to the brute force employment of extremely large basis sets . numerical work",
    "@xcite on various correlation treatments of the helium atom has shown that the basis set incompleteness error is approximately proportional to the inverse third power of the maximum angular momentum , provided that all angular momenta are radially saturated .",
    "however , the ideal conditions of fully saturated angular momenta in an atomic system are rather distant from those encountered in real applications on molecules with finite basis sets .",
    "nevertheless , the correlation energy has been empirically observed to converge regularly enough to allow the development of various accurate extrapolation schemes which have been assessed in several studies in literature @xcite . on the other hand , no such study has been performed for rpa correlation energies",
    ".    in this paper we aim at filling this gap and shed light on the usefulness and limits of different extrapolation schemes for rpa correlation energies . in this respect",
    "the goal of the present work is to : ( 1 ) create a set of benchmark cbs rpa absolute correlation energies to be used as reference for future assessments ; ( 2 ) validate some extrapolation schemes , usually applied in the context of coupled cluster theory , for the calculation of cbs rpa absolute energies , including semiempirical techniques to approach the extrapolation from relatively small basis sets ; ( 3 ) test the convergence behavior of different basis sets and the reliability of the extrapolations schemes for atomization energies , which exploit a significant error cancellation effect .",
    "absolute correlation energies will be considered , as in many corresponding studies of correlated methods , because these converge regularly with the basis set and provide an ideal quantity for the study of extrapolation schemes . in this paper",
    "we focus on light elements because they provide a simpler convergence of the correlation energy and can be more easily investigated with large basis sets .",
    "rpa calculations were performed using the eigenvalues and the orbitals from dft calculations based on the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional @xcite . in all calculations dunning s correlation - consistent basis sets @xcite ( cc - pv@xmath0z , @xmath1 ) augmented with core and core - valence basis functions",
    "@xcite were employed .",
    "these are hereafter denoted as v@xmath0zcv with @xmath0=4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 . augmented",
    "diffuse basis functions were not considered in the present work since they were shown to slow down rpa basis set convergence without bringing substantial benefits in most cases @xcite . also , no basis set superposition error correction was considered for atomization energies . for molecules experimental geometries",
    "were considered @xcite .",
    "all calculations were performed with the turbomole program package @xcite using the implementation described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the inspection of tab .",
    "[ tab4 ] reveals that several approaches are capable to yield very good results , with mean absolute errors close to 1 mha and mean relative errors smaller than 1% .",
    "in particular , all the calculations using raw basis - set results ( except v4zcv ) perform remarkably well , showing a significantly better performance with respect to the case of absolute energies , thanks to the cancellation of systematic errors in the present case . interestingly little or no benefit comes instead from the use of extrapolation techniques .",
    "in fact , 67-extrapolation results are in line with v7zcv results , while 56-extrapolation atomization energies are even worst that v5zcv ones and of similar quality as the v4zcv results .",
    "this result shall be rationalized in terms of an inevitable small but random computational noise that affects the extrapolation data ( especially if small basis sets are used as a base for the extrapolation ) .",
    "the small inaccuracies of extrapolated data can be in fact almost irrelevant for absolute energies ( below 1 mha ) , but can easily sum to several mha in the case of atomization energies ( especially for many atoms molecules ) .",
    "finally , we remark the good performance of the semiempirical extrapolation method , which yields atomization energies in good agreement with the reference ones , with a mean absolute relative error of only 0.75% and very small maximum absolute deviation and standard deviation .    the results of tab .",
    "[ tab4 ] show that the quality of each extrapolation procedure to yield accurate atomization energies can not be directly inferred from the results obtained for absolute energies , because atomization energies are energy differences and thus a complex error propagation can occur . as we showed",
    "this effect is more important for low - level approaches and is somehow amplified for extrapolated results , because of the presence of unsystematic errors due to the numerical procedure .",
    "it is thus finally important to note that this issue applies also for our reference atomization energies , that were obtained from the best estimated rpa absolute energies of tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] , although in this case we may expect the effect to be rather limited due to the high quality of the extrapolation . nevertheless , we have to remark that possibly errors of few mha are plausible for some systems , so that in general the set can not be fully considered as an accurate benchmark set of atomization energies , although it could be safely considered as reference for a qualitative discussion of the trends obtained from different extrapolation methods .",
    "the slow basis set convergence of the rpa correlation energy is a major problem for the development and the application of the method in quantum chemistry and solid - state physics .",
    "in fact , a careful assessment of the rpa methodology and related methods ( e.g. , rpa+ @xcite , rpa+se @xcite ) , requires the existence of a set of benchmark absolute and relative rpa - correlation energies as well as the availability of accurate extrapolation techniques .",
    "practical applications , on the other hand , would greatly benefit from efficient extrapolation schemes with well calibrated levels of confidence .",
    "surprisingly however only little effort has been dedicated in literature to study the cbs limit of rpa correlation energies and assess the effectiveness of different extrapolation procedures in this context . in this paper we aimed at pushing this work",
    "one step further and considered the problem in a more systematic way , constructing a benchmark set of reference rpa - correlation energies and studying the behavior of different extrapolation schemes in the rpa framework .",
    "our work can be summarized in the following conclusions :    * the extremely slow convergence of the rpa correlation energy with the basis set dimension prevents the computation of highly accurate reference energies . already at the v7zcv level in fact",
    "the energies can be incorrect up to 10 mha .",
    "nevertheless , we showed that a careful extrapolation procedure allows to construct an accurate benchmark set with a well defined estimation of the uncertainty . in the present work we estimate our reference data to have an accuracy close to 1 mha for most of the systems .",
    "* we analyzed several two - point extrapolation formulas against our benchmark set of absolute rpa correlation energies .",
    "it turns out that good results can only be achieved if global parameters are optimized in eqs .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) , ( [ e6 ] ) , and ( [ e7 ] ) , as to effectively reproduce high - order terms in the theoretical asymptotic energy expansion ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "when this procedure is followed all the considered formulas provide equivalent results .",
    "moreover , with a careful optimization of the global parameters very good results can also be achieved from 56-extrapolation procedures .",
    "* rpa correlation energies evaluated at the v4zcv level appear to be of too low quality to serve as a basis in an extrapolation procedure with globally optimized parameters .",
    "this fact indicates that in the case of 45-extrapolations high - order terms beyond the @xmath3 one , play a crucial role and are thus dominant in the asymptotic expansion .",
    "therefore , rpa energies obtained at the quadruple - zeta level of theory can not be considered well converged with respect to the one - particle expansion in basis set and shall not be used in applications .",
    "nevertheless , the introduction of atomic - based parameters within a semiempirical extrapolation scheme can strongly reduce the problem and provide extrapolated rpa absolute energies of good quality ( within 2 mha from the reference ) .",
    "the semiempirical extrapolation method can thus be considered as a good tool for the cbs extrapolation in rpa applications on large systems .",
    "* when energy differences are considered , an unpredictable error propagation occurs and accurate cbs results are even more hard to achieve than the absolute correlation energies .",
    "however , because an error cancellation occurs for the systematic errors ( e.g. systematic underestimation of the energy by incomplete basis sets ) we finally found that most approaches yield results that agree within 2 mha . because no highly accurate reference data exist to assess such small differences , no clear preference can be expressed for any of the considered approaches and 2 mha ( @xmath4 kcal / mol , @xmath5 mev ) must be considered the level of confidence of state - of - the - art rpa calculations on atomization energies . therefore , caution must be always employed when small energy difference are considered .",
    "we mention finally that , following the encouraging results of the present study , further investigations will be needed to assess in detail the basis set - dependence of rpa energies and the accuracy of extrapolation schemes for energy differences ( e.g. atomization energies ) , which are a main quantity in many practical computational studies .",
    "in fact , when energy differences are considered , an unpredictable error propagation may occur and accurate cbs results are harder to achieve than the absolute correlation energies , despite the former can be directly derived as an algebraic sum of the latter . from our calculations",
    "it can be easily seen indeed that all the approaches considered in this work yield very similar atomization energies for the molecules of the test set , with differences mostly below 2 - 3 mha .",
    "however , no clear trend can be identified between the different approaches , so that no highly accurate reference data can be established to assess such small differences .",
    "this traces back to the fact that systematic errors ( e.g. systematic underestimation of the energy by incomplete basis sets ) may be expected to cancel out in this case , but extrapolation procedures may introduce in general unsystematic errors which worsen the results with respect to the raw data obtained from the corresponding basis sets .",
    "we thank turbomole gmbh for providing us with the turbomole program package , and m. margarito for technical support .",
