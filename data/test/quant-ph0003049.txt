    "the existence of geometric phases in quantum systems , ever since its discovery by berry @xcite , has attracted considerable interest both from the theoretical and experimental viewpoints .",
    "several applications of this phenomenon in different areas of physics have also been studied@xcite .",
    "comparatively much less work has been devoted to the question of the dynamical evolution of such systems in the presence of a weakly dissipative medium .",
    "basically the available results can be summarized as follows : nonhermitian operators lead to a modification of berry s phase@xcite , stochastically evolving magnetic fields produce both energy shift and broadening@xcite , phenomenological weakly dissipative liouvillians alter berry s phase by introducing an imaginary correction@xcite or causing damping and mixing of the density matrix elements@xcite .",
    "@xcite obtain their results studying the eigenmatrices of the complete liouvillian superoperator in a time - independent basis , while gamliel and freed@xcite , find closed formal expressions for the density matrix representation in the instantaneous frame of the hamiltonian in the adiabatic limit , and in the weak dissipation approximation .",
    "however , even in this regime the results in the cases studied can only be extracted through approximations ( in addition to the adiabatic approximation ) or numerical computation .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider the celebrated example of a spin 1/2 particle coupled to a slowly evolving magnetic field in the presence of a weakly dissipative medium as represented by a lindblad form superoperator@xcite , incorporated in a convenient and physically motivated frame . in the absence of dissipation ,",
    "a simple geometrical interpretation of the results emerges in terms of both the bloch s vector@xcite and the phase vector@xcite .",
    "the geometrical phase appears as a `` delay '' or an `` advance '' in the precession period of the bloch s vector with respect to the period dictated by the magnetic field s frequency .",
    "the precession of this vector occurs at a fixed angle with respect to a fixed axis about which the external magnetic field precesses , as usual .",
    "we will introduce the dissipation via a semi - group type dynamics , such that dissipation does not alter the precession frequency .",
    "however , the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 components of bloch s vector are altered in different ways by nonunitary effects .",
    "in particular , the modulus of bloch s vector will shrink .",
    "the relation between the reduction of bloch s vector modulus and the loss of coherence has been explored by stodolsky and collaborators@xcite . in order to make it explicit , we introduce the linear entropy ( or idempotency defect ) as a measure of purity loss@xcite    @xmath3    and write    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the bloch s vector .",
    "we get    @xmath6    which confirms that the shrinking of the modulus of @xmath7 is a measure of coherence loss .    in order to discuss dissipative effects on interference patterns due to berry s geometrical phase",
    "the natural framework is to consider the evolution of the density matrix , which completely characterizes the interference effect due to the different geometric phases acquired by the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian of the system , even in the absence of dissipation@xcite . of course , this time we add a nonunitary liouville operator contribution to the dynamics .    in section 2",
    "we present the two level quantum system of a spin 1/2 in the presence of an external magnetic field precessing with constant angular velocity around a fixed axis .",
    "the master equation of the model is written in what we call the diagonal frame where lindblad superoperators are introduced to describe the nonunitary part of the liouville operator . in subsection 2.1",
    "we consider the adiabatic limit of the quantum system in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir of electromagnetic fields and in subsection 2.2 we consider the case of a dephasing process . in both cases ,",
    "we treat the coupling of the quantum system with its environment in the weak regime . in section 3",
    "we show how the geometric phases and the dissipation effects acts on the @xmath2 component of the magnetization of the spin 1/2 coupled to a reservoir of electromagnetic fields at thermal equilibrium . in section 4 we summarize our conclusions ; finally , in appendix a , we present the non - unitary part of the liouvillians of the models under consideration in the instantaneous basis of the hamiltonian .",
    "we consider a spin 1/2 variable ( two level model ) coupled to a time dependent magnetic field precessing around the z - axis .",
    "the unitary contribution for this evolution is given by the hamiltonian    @xmath8    written in the basis of the eigenstates of the @xmath2-component of the spin , where @xmath9 is the norm of the external magnetic field , @xmath10 its azimuthal angle , @xmath11 the precession frequency and the constant @xmath12 , being @xmath13 land s factor and @xmath14 the bohr magneton .",

    "the representation of the density matrix in the diagonal frame is not very enlightening for this purpose .",

    "the definition of the geometrical phase can also be given in terms of a phase vector as in reference@xcite , where the discussion is confined to pure states .",

    "we find that the loss of coherence will shorten the phase vector in a manner which is completely analogous to what happens to bloch s vector .",
