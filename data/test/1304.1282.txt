    "epitaxy is an important concept for the fabrication of films with good crystalline quality like overlayers , multilayers , compound materials , and ordered alloys .",
    "such films are technologically important materials with adjustable electronic , magnetic , and optical properties  @xcite .",
    "epitaxial growth also allows to study fundamental aspects of low - dimensional structures and interfacial effects , and it allows to produce structures that are unstable in the bulk  @xcite . for example , body - centered cubic ( bcc ) co does not exist as a bulk phase but was stabilized by epitaxial growth on a gaas substrate  @xcite .    in coherent or pseudomorphic film growth , the in - plane film lattice parameters are determined by the substrate - in - plane lattice parameters .",
    "this allows to expose a material to static , non - isotropic but homogeneous strain which is a valuable mean to influence its intrinsic properties  @xcite .",
    "experiments on ferromagnetic bulk - like films showed , that the magnetic moments , the curie temperature , and the magnetic anisotropy can be tuned in a quasi - continuous manner by varying the substrate  @xcite . using piezoelectric substrates , even a continuous variation of the lattice parameters and of the related film properties",
    "was achieved  @xcite .    here , we predict by density - functional calculations scanning 30 non - magnetic metallic elements , that bulk - like epitaxial films of at least six metals show first - order martensitic transitions upon variation of the epitaxial strain .",
    "for example , we find jumps in the lattice parameter of la by @xmath3  and in the superconducting critical temperature of v by 20% .",
    "the examples considered in the present work include only the simplest case of tetragonal non - magnetic monoatomic films .",
    "we however emphasize that our main result , the possibility of isostructural phase transitions  @xcite under epitaxial strain and a related discontinuous dependence of intrinsic film properties on the interface lattice parameters , is not restricted to certain structures , compositions , or ground states .",
    "we model the structures of the considered films by the epitaxial bain path ( ebp )  @xcite .",
    "the ebp model applies to the bulk part ( i.e. , the interior ) of a coherently grown thick film  @xcite .",
    "it assumes that the film can be described by a bulk structure with periodicity in all three dimensions .",
    "due to epitaxial coherency , the in - plane film lattice parameters are rigidly tied to the substrate lattice parameters in the substrate - film interface via the underlying epitaxial relationship . on the other hand ,",
    "the film is free to relax its geometry perpendicular to the interface due to the absence of forces .",
    "summarizing , the model neglects all surface and interface effects except the determination of the in - plane film lattice parameters by the substrate .    in the past",
    ", the ebp model was used to predict metastable states in transition metals  @xcite , to investigate the magnetic order in strained overlayers  @xcite , and to identify the mother phases of strained bulk - like films  @xcite . in the same context , we recently suggested ru , os , and u films to be ferromagnetic in certain ranges of epitaxial strain  @xcite .",
    "focusing on the important case of substrates with four - fold surface symmetry and body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) films with ( 001 ) orientation , we denote the in - plane film lattice parameter by @xmath4 and the out - of - plane lattice parameter by @xmath5 , see . the mentioned absence of forces perpendicular to the substrate - film interface allows for a relaxation of @xmath5 minimizing the total film energy @xmath6 at any fixed value of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "hence , the ebp of a certain bct material is the set of points @xmath7 , for which @xmath8 the side condition determines the relaxation of @xmath5 for a given @xmath4 and defines the relation @xmath9 .",
    "quantities traced _ along _",
    "the ebp only depend on @xmath4 , e.g. , the total energy @xmath10 .",
    "the difference between @xmath11 and the ground state energy of the film material , @xmath12 , corresponds to the general definition of an epitaxial strain energy  @xcite .",
    "a strict implementation of the notion ` relaxation of @xmath5 minimizing @xmath6 ' leads to relevant , until now disregarded consequences for all materials to which strained coherent epitaxy applies .",
    "as we show , the function @xmath13 can have two equal - valued global minima at @xmath14 for certain values of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , @xmath9 can be discontinuous at @xmath16 in a first - order transition .",
    "this includes , by epitaxial coherency , also the dependence of @xmath2 on the substrate lattice parameters in the interface plane . in this way ,",
    "the possibility to tune overlayer - material specific properties can be restricted to a discontinuous manner .",
    "however , one can switch these properties on purpose , if one succeeds to control the lattice parameter @xmath4 in a narrow interval around @xmath16 , e.g. , by a piezoelectric substrate .    in the following ,",
    "we verify the existence of degenerate global minima in @xmath13 by high - precision density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations , carried out with the full - potential local - orbital scheme fplo-7.00 - 28  @xcite . using the local - density approximation according to ref .",
    "@xcite ( pw92 ) and a scalar - relativistic mode for elements with atomic number @xmath17 , a full - relativistic mode otherwise , we scanned the ebp of 30 elements with the atomic numbers 20 - 23 , 29 , 30 , 38 - 48 , 56 , 57 , 71 - 80 , and 92 in a wide range of parameters @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the convergence of numerical parameters and the basis set were carefully checked  @xcite . in order to converge the total energy per atom at a level smaller than @xmath18 mev ,",
    "linear - tetrahedron integrations with blchl corrections were performed on a @xmath19 mesh in the full brillouin zone , apart from the elements cu , ru , ir , and pt , for which a denser @xmath20 mesh was required .",
    "all detected degenerate minima in @xmath13 were cross - checked by additional calculations employing the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe96 ) parameterization of the exchange - correlation functional  @xcite ( results listed in table  [ table : discontinuities ] ) .",

    "vanadium is one of the elements which ebp was studied in several investigations  @xcite .",
    "this provides us with the following , as we will argue incomplete , picture .",
    "the ebp of vanadium includes two energy minima : one corresponds to the stable bcc phase ; the other one at @xmath23  , @xmath24 , is a local minimum , see .",
    "this local minimum corresponds to an unstable bct bulk state  @xcite , since its energy is lowered by a shear deformation .",

    "@xcite however succeeded to stabilize coherently grown vanadium - films on cu\\{001 } and ni\\{001 } which structures were determined to be strained derivatives of this bct state .",

    "the two discontinuities of the ebp are marked by solid bars on both the @xmath4 and the @xmath28 scale .",
    "the first discontinuity at @xmath29 results in a pronounced drop in @xmath30 .",
    "the second discontinuity at @xmath31 is related to a peak in the dos .",
    "the energies are spline interpolated to guide the eye .",
    "the pw92 equilibrium lattice parameters of the cubic structures are @xmath32 ; @xmath33 .",
    "the brown broken line denotes the bcc structure . ]    by symmetry , the bcc structure ( @xmath22 ) and the fcc structure ( @xmath21 ) are stationary points of @xmath6  @xcite , but the side condition in definition determines , _ whether they are located at the ebp or not_. at variance with previous reports  @xcite , we find that the fcc structure does _ not _ belong to the ebp of vanadium , because it is unstable against a tetragonal distortion at fixed @xmath34 .",
    "we note , that in terms of linear elasticity theory this instability of fcc vanadium with respect to a relaxation of @xmath5 corresponds to a negative elastic constant @xmath35 , since @xmath36 .",

    "there , @xmath37 has a local maximum at @xmath38 and the global minimum is situated at @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",

    ", double wells also occur for other values of @xmath4 in the vicinity of @xmath42 .",

    "all in all , the behavior shown in is typical for a first - order phase transition .",

    "the already described ( first ) discontinuity occurs at @xmath47 . the associated change of @xmath28 amounts to @xmath48 .",

    "for example ,",
    "if abscissa and ordinate axes in a were interchanged , determining the ebp would mean to search for minima along horizontals , which would result in a continuous ebp including the fcc structure .    in order to analyze the origin of the discontinuities",
    ", we consider the electronic density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level , @xmath30 , see and b. the transition at @xmath58 is accompanied by a pronounced change in @xmath30 due to a significant change of the unit cell volume .",
