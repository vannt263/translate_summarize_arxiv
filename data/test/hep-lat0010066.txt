    "the heavy quark - antiquark potential is known quite accurately in quenched simulations@xcite .",
    "it is traditionally measured with the wilson - loop observable , proportional to @xmath0 $ ] at large @xmath1 . in the presence of dynamical quarks",
    "it is expected that the potential levels off with increasing @xmath2 , signaling string breaking .",
    "however , in qcd simulations string breaking has proven to be very difficult to detect with this observable , even out to @xmath3 fm@xcite .",
    "the reason string breaking has not been seen using the traditional wilson - loop observable has been apparent for some time @xcite .",
    "the wilson loop can be regarded as a hadron correlator with a source and sink state `` f '' consisting of a fixed heavy quark - antiquark pair and an associated flux tube .",
    "the correct lowest energy contribution to the wilson - loop correlator at large @xmath2 should be a state `` m '' consisting of two isolated heavy - light mesons .",
    "however , such a state with an extra light dynamical quark pair has poor overlap with the flux - tube state , so it is presumably revealed only after evolution to very large @xmath1 . to hasten the emergence of the true ground state",
    ", it is necessary to enlarge the space of sources to include both f and at least one m state .",
    "string breaking has been demonstrated in the strong - coupling approximation to qcd @xcite , and a variety of qcd - like theories @xcite , and in su(3 ) with dynamical quarks at nonzero temperature@xcite .",
    "last year , we reported a preliminary low - statistics result for two flavors of staggered quarks @xcite , and , earlier this year , pennanen and michael announced evidence for string breaking at zero temperature using wilson - clover quarks and a novel technique for variance reduction in computing the light quark propagator @xcite .",
    "this year we report results with higher statistics @xcite .",
    "we work with 198 configurations of size @xmath4 , generated with the one - plaquette gauge action at @xmath5 in the presence of two flavors of conventional dynamical staggered quarks of mass @xmath6 .",
    "the lattice spacing ( _ via _ the sommer parameter @xcite ) is approximately 0.163 fm , and @xmath7 , giving a comfortable box size and a relatively light quark .",
    "our flux tube `` f '' source and sink operator is constructed from the product of smeared spatial links , for the most part taken along one of the lattice axes , using 10 ape smearing iterations @xcite , combining the direct link with a factor @xmath8 ( in our case , @xmath9 ) and six staples with factor @xmath10 with su(3 ) projection after each iteration .",
    "the correlator of this operator @xmath11 is the familiar wilson loop with smeared space - like segments , and point - like static quark and antiquark lines .",
    "our two - meson source and sink operator `` m '' is the direct product of static - light meson and antimeson operators . in constructing the static - light meson",
    "we use a light - quark wave function with weight 2 at zero separation and 1 on each of the six on - axis second neighbors .",
    "thus we measure the additional correlation matrix elements @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , diagramed in figs .",
    "[ fig : d1 ] and [ fig : e1 ] .",
    "these observables are computed for all translational and cubic rotational displacements .",
    "the required all - to - all propagator is estimated using a random source technique with 128 random sources per configuration .",
    "the static - light meson correlator in fig .",
    "[ fig : slprop ] has contributions from both a nonoscillating @xmath15-wave ( @xmath16-meson - like ) light - quark orbital and oscillating @xmath17-wave ( @xmath18-meson - like ) orbital with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "thus our two - meson correlator includes nonoscillating combinations @xmath21 and @xmath22 and an oscillating @xmath23 .",
    "if mixing is weak , our two - channel correlators should also include a flux - tube level with an approximately coulomb - plus - linear behavior in @xmath2 .",
    "our fit ansatz for the two - channel correlator is @xmath24^{t+1 } ~ , \\label{eq : transition}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 refer to the flux tube @xmath26 or meson - meson @xmath27 states and @xmath28 is a real ( positive or negative ) eigenvalue of the transfer matrix .",
    "the channel energy is @xmath29 .    for simplicity",
    "we restrict the analysis to three spectral components @xmath30 corresponding in the unmixed language , respectively , to the @xmath21 , @xmath23 , and flux - tube components . the peculiar phase for the flux tube component is required by discrete lattice symmetry and",
    "can be obtained simply by interpreting the wilson loop as a heavy staggered quark loop .",
    "results for the three levels are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] .",
    "we see clear evidence for string breaking at the first level crossing ( about 1 fm ) , but with our statistics , we see no evidence for rounding associated with avoided level crossing . thus string - breaking pair - creation and annihilation transitions are weak in qcd .    to explore mixing further",
    ", we introduce a mixing model similar to that of drummond , pennanen and michael@xcite . @xmath31 where the transfer matrix is given by @xmath32 and the mixing coefficients",
    "are @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this model matches our fit ansatz reasonably well , allowing us to extract values for the mixing parameters , the _ magnitudes _ of which are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : mixing_x ] and [ fig : mixing_y ] .",
    "we see that mixing is weak and is small in the vicinity of level crossing .",
    "to see string breaking in the heavy - quark potential , it is helpful to introduce explicit meson - meson channels .",
    "mixing among the channels is found to be very weak .",
    "string breaking occurs at the first level crossing , _",
    "i.e. _ , with our quark mass , about one fermi .",
    "these results justify a two - channel model of excited quarkonium decay , in which a closed channel populated by bound states couples weakly to an open channel @xcite .",
