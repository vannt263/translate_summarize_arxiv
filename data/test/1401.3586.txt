    "in shear flows such as plane couette flow ( fig .  [ sk ] ) , the discontinuous nature of the transition to turbulence allows the spatial coexistence of laminar and turbulent flow .",
    "the spot stage corresponds to the expansion in two directions of turbulence , triggered by a strong enough local perturbation of the laminar flow .",

    "this note is interested in a departure from the streaks & vortices flow that has been reported in the band regime of plane couette flow @xcite .",
    "this secondary instability of the velocity streaks is very similar to what is found in hagen ",
    "poiseuille pipe flow @xcite .",
    "this departure resembles a secondary kelvin  helmholtz instability of the streamwise velocity which forms rolls characterised by spanwise vorticity .",
    "the preliminary study of the instability showed that linear analysis rendered the phenomenon well .",
    "like other studies @xcite , this note will stress on the advection by the large scale flow around the band or the spot .",
    "indeed , the effect of an unsteady large scale flow on the advection of the rolls , as well as its behaviour for @xmath2 are unknown .",
    "spot growth is an interesting system in that case , since it is the only regime where laminar and turbulent flow coexist at large reynolds numbers , and where a net large scale flow can be found .    in order to investigate these questions ,",
    "this article is organised as follow : the numerical procedure and the system are described in a first section (   [ meth ] ) .",
    "two examples of growth and reorganisation of the spot , corresponding to two reynolds numbers above and below @xmath3 , are studied quantitatively . the instability is then described , first qualitatively on snapshots , then quantitatively using procedures that will be studied systematically in a future article @xcite (   [ inst ] ) .",

    "the system is formally described by the incompressible navier  stokes equations with plane couette base flow and in plane periodic boundary conditions ( fig .  [ sk ] ) .",

    "the departure @xmath12 from the plane couette baseflow @xmath13 is the variable of interest .",
    "the square of the norm of the departure @xmath14 is termed the energy .",

    "this feature is found for bands as well @xcite and leads to the so called overhanging regions @xcite . given the organisation of the flow @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ f1_bis ] ) , we define the laminar , intermediate and turbulent zones .",
    "the laminar zone corresponds to no departure from the the laminar base flow .",
    "the intermediate , or overhanging , zone corresponds to turbulence on top or below laminar flow @xcite .",
    "the turbulent zone corresponds to turbulence over the whole gap .    in order to provide quantitative definitions of these zones",
    ", we use a coarse graining and thresholding procedure .",
    "it has been introduced in a former article @xcite , and discriminates between laminar and turbulent locations in the flow .",

    "we are in the intermediate or overhanging zone .",
    "this discrimination procedure is used to compute the turbulent fraction @xmath31 , which measures the volume occupied by turbulence , _ i.e. _ the fraction of turbulent cells .",

    "this yields @xmath32 , the turbulent energy .",
    "it measures the intensity of turbulent inside the bands or spots .",
    "the square of the norm @xmath14 ( kinetic energy ) averaged over the whole flow is simply denominated as average energy @xmath33 .",
    "this discrimination procedure allows one to compute the area @xmath34 projected on the planes @xmath35 occupied by the intermediate zone between turbulent and pseudo - laminar flow @xcite .",
    "this is the number of @xmath27 turbulent cells facing a @xmath26 laminar one plus that of @xmath26 turbulent cells facing a @xmath27 laminar one , divided by half the number of cells .",

    "helmholtz type instability reported in the bands @xcite and in pipe flow @xcite is found in the spots as well .",
    "the streamwise and spanwise lengthscales are unchanged by the spot or band configuration .",
    "the perturbations are advected in a direction and with a velocity very close to that of the large scale flow around the spot .",
    "the difference lies in the large scale organisation of turbulence .",
    "the same findings are expected for spot growth in large domains @xcite , where they can take various shapes . moreover , no qualitative difference is found between the @xmath136 and the @xmath2 cases .",
    "the lengthscales , although smaller in spanwise direction , are of the same order of magnitude . the so - called secondary instability can be invoked in cycles of the same kind as those proposed for poiseuille pipe flow @xcite .",
    "vorticity is advected toward the spanwise interface of the spot can contribute to the excitation of the interface .",
    "together with the large scale flow , the rolls can stimulate the stochastic mechanism of spanwise growth @xcite .",
    "however the precise mechanical mechanism of the creation of streaks and vorticies on the side of the spot is unknown .",
    "the interaction of the spanwise vorticity is a matter of future investigations .",
    "linear modeling @xcite explains the onset of the instability at the local level and the effect of the advection , refinements taking into account the time evolution of the baseflow can be used in the case of the spot @xcite .",
    "non - linear models can shed light on the interaction between this instability and the other processes found in the flow , to improve the understanding of the spot growth process .",
    "no qualitative differences between the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 .",
    "this fact suggests that this instability _ alone _ has no effect on the disappearance of the bands as @xmath52 grows toward @xmath3 .",
    "other effects are at play : the appearance of laminar troughs for @xmath52 below @xmath3 in an uniformly turbulent flow has been described in dns @xcite as well as in models @xcite .",
