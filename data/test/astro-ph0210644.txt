    "strong gravitational lensing of background objects by massive clusters of galaxies is expected to produce multiple images with wide separations , @xmath0 , and the multiple images of background lensed galaxies have long been known with radii of giant arc systems up to @xmath1 ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , despite a number of searches , primarily in large - area radio surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) , widely - separated multiple images of qsos have not yet been found .",
    "this is attributable to the low probability of strong lensing along any given line of sight coupled with the relatively low numbers of known qsos .",
    "the widest separation qso lensed systems have separations @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "other wide - separation multiple qso systems found to date are more likely to be `` binary qsos '' ( that is , a pair of active black holes cohabiting the same parent host galaxy ) rather than multiple images of the same qso @xcite .    we have searched a catalogue of 22,163 qsos that comprises the recently completed 2df qso survey ( `` the 2qz survey '' ) for candidate wide - separation lensed qso systems and have obtained higher signal - to - noise spectra in an attempt to eliminate obvious non - lensed systems and to identify systems that are likely to be genuine lensed systems . after an incomplete survey of the most likely candidates , there remain six systems which , with varying degrees of confidence , are likely to be lensed .",
    "the 2qz survey covers 740 deg@xmath3 in two strips of sky , one centred on the south galactic pole region and the other on the celestial equator in the region of the north galactic pole .",
    "the survey photometry is described by @xcite and the initial release of the first 10,000 qsos is described by @xcite . in constructing the 2qz survey ,",
    "candidate qsos were first selected from @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 photographic photometry of morphologically - stellar objects , and objects whose colours lay bluewards of the main stellar locus were selected for low resolution spectroscopy at the two - degree field ( 2df ) facility at the anglo - australian telescope .",
    "the initial spectra obtained were of sufficient quality that reliable identifications of qsos and measurements of their redshifts could be made , with an r.m.s .",
    "error in redshift measurement of typically 0.0035 @xcite , although it should be noted that the redshift error for an individual object depends on its brightness and emission - line equivalent widths as well as observing conditions .",
    "the absolute accuracy of the photometry in each band is estimated as @xmath7 magnitudes at the faint survey limit @xcite .",
    "the relative photometric accuracy for objects measured close together on the same photographic plate is better than this , however : @xcite found that , for objects more than two magnitudes brighter than the completeness limit of the photographic plate , relative photometry accurate to @xmath8 magnitudes was typical , with that value rising rapidly to values @xmath9 magnitudes as the plate limit is approached .",
    "the resulting catalogue of photographic photometry and spectroscopically confirmed qsos was then searched for pairs or multiple systems whose colours were consistent given the large photometric uncertainties and whose redshifts were consistent given the typical redshift uncertainty . to determine the colour consistency , it was assumed that two qsos , if lensed , should have the same @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 magnitudes apart from a magnitude offset arising from differential magnification of the images in a lensed system , and thus assuming negligible effects due to variations in qso colours with time ( see section  [ timedelay ] ) .",
    "the statistic used as the measure of colour consistency was @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the difference in apparent magnitude of the two qsos measured in waveband @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the average magnitude difference for that qso pair .",
    "redshift consistency was measured by the difference , @xmath14 in 2qz catalogue redshift of two qsos .",
    "candidate multiple systems were initially selected if they satisfied the criteria @xmath15 , @xmath16 and angular separation @xmath17 .",
    "the colour criterion is close to the expected scatter in this statistic , given the photometric errors at the survey limit , and hence we expect the initial colour selection to select only @xmath18% of the lensed systems . the redshift criterion is a factor two larger than the expected scatter in @xmath14 and this criteria should allow the majority of lensed systems to be selected .",
    "the stringent colour criterion was chosen in this initial study in order to maximise the probability of finding lensed systems , and hence further observations should be carried out to establish the true completeness of the selected sample .",
    "a further check was made on the consistency of their radio properties by searching for detections in the nvss @xcite .",
    "one candidate pair with clearly discrepant radio detections was removed from the sample of candidates .",
    "the nvss properties of two remaining pairs are discussed further in section 3 .",
    "candidates with @xmath19 were selected from 12307 qsos in the sgp region and from 9856 qsos in the ngp region of the 2qz survey , and 38 pairs of qsos in total met these criteria . of the qsos with confirmed redshifts ,",
    "there were no candidate systems selected with more than two members , although some of the pairs do have additional @xmath20-selected companions for which 2qz spectroscopic observations either were not carried out or did not lead to a positive identification .",
    "our expectation is that the majority of the selected pairs will not prove to be lensed systems .",
    "test samples were also constructed in attempt to assess the possible contamination .",
    "first , qsos pairs that are more widely separated , but still within one degree of each other and measured on the same photographic plates , were selected with @xmath21 and the distribution of @xmath22 was compared with the @xmath22 distribution of the candidate pairs .",
    "no statistically - significant difference was found , although this is probably a reflection of the large errors in @xmath22 arising from the large photographic photometry errors .",
    "a second test sample comprising qso pairs with @xmath23 and @xmath16 was selected and the distribution of angular separations , normalised by the total number of pairs selected with @xmath24 , was compared with the candidate lens sample selected to have @xmath15 .",
    "this time there was an excess of pairs on arcminute scales in the sample of candidate lensed systems consistent with a minority of the pairs being lensed systems , but because of the small numbers of pairs selected the test was not statistically significant . hence at this stage there is no evidence either for or against the hypothesis that the selected sample contains a subset of lensed systems .",
    "further evidence needs to be collected on all members of the sample in order to establish its completeness and contamination .    a key part of that evidence is the follow - up spectroscopy described in the next section . because of limitations of observing time and observing conditions , only a subset of the candidates have had such observations , and only that subset is described in the remainder of this paper . for prioritising the observations ,",
    "the pairs were ranked in @xmath25 and also in @xmath22 : a composite rank was produced by multiplying these ranks and the top candidates in each region were observed . in the sgp region ,",
    "10 pairs were observed , but the spectroscopic follow - up is particularly sparse in the ngp region , where only for one pair have spectra been obtained of sufficient quality to allow some assessment of whether or not it may be lensed . at this stage the sample reported here can not be regarded as either being complete or free from contamination by non - lensed pairs of qsos .",
    "we postpone any discussion of the completeness of the sample to later work .",
    "we anticipate that in future the candidate qso pairs in the ngp region will also have the benefit of more accurate , five - band , colours from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , which should lead both to samples of candidates with lower contamination and with better quantified photometric uncertainties",
    ".    in the following sections each pair is designated by the iau naming convention applied to the mean position of the pair , in the fk5 ( equinox j2000 ) coordinate system .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ edr ]",
    "if these systems of paired qsos are indeed lensed qsos , then the lenses should be identifiable as clusters of galaxies .",
    "as described in section 2 , one of the possible lensed systems , j@xmath26 , appears associated with a galaxy cluster at @xmath27 .",
    "ten galaxies in the vicinity have redshifts , measured by the 2df galaxy redshift survey , that are close to this value , with a velocity dispersion of about 600  km  sec@xmath28 ( fig .  [ fchart ] ) .",
    "such a velocity dispersion would however produce an image splitting of only about @xmath29 for an isothermal sphere lens , so if this cluster is the lens then either an anisotropic or a more centrally concentrated mass distribution is needed . the total mass required to produce the observed image splitting is @xmath30 m . there is also a weak rosat - detected x - ray source close to the position of the two bright galaxies which lie along the line joining the two qsos , although the origin of the emission is not known .",
    "at present it is not clear if sufficient mass is present in this cluster to produce the observed image splitting .",
    "one other system , j0150@xmath312921 , may also have a low - redshift cluster associated with it , again based on redshift measurements from the 2df galaxy redshift survey , although in this case only three redshifts are currently known ( fig .  [ fchart ] ) .    in order to estimate the expected distribution of lens redshifts we consider the calculations presented by @xcite in which the lensing clusters are assumed to have spherically - symmetric @xcite mass profiles , and to have an abundance predicted by the @xcite evolving mass function .",
    "here we assume a cold dark matter power spectrum @xcite modified to include an approximate correction for baryons @xcite in a @xmath32cdm cosmology with @xmath33 and @xmath34 and a power - spectrum normalisation given by @xmath35 . in this model , it is found that the distribution of lens redshifts is not sensitive to the choice of cosmological parameters , although the abundance of lensing systems is .",
    "magnification bias is calculated as discussed by @xcite .    within this model ,",
    "it is clear that a lensing cluster is expect to have @xmath36 , and for the widest separations the model predicts that any lens should have @xmath37 .",
    "however , the total probability predicted for @xmath38 lensed systems is so low that such systems are expected only if there are significant departures from the assumptions of the model , in which case the lens redshift distribution would need to be recalculated .",
    "at this stage it can not be regarded as conclusive that these candidate systems are indeed lensed , and we also do not yet have an accurate assessment of the completeness of the lensing search .",
    "nonetheless it is interesting to compare the results presented here with the expectations of lensing models . @xcite and @xcite have calculated the expected distribution of angular separations arising from strong lensing by massive clusters of galaxies in the standard cosmological framework that assumes structure grows hierarchically from initial gaussian perturbations in a universe dominated by cold dark matter and dark energy . with cosmological parameters",
    "as determined from the wmap observations @xcite the expected number of systems with @xmath39 in the 2qz survey of @xmath40 qsos is about 0.5 @xcite , so it is possible , although not highly likely , that the 2qz survey contains wide - separation lensed systems .",
    "however , the distribution is expected to be dominated by angular separations towards the lower end of the range , and in this standard model the expected number of systems with @xmath41 is only @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation is that the widest - separation systems presented here are not in fact lensed , despite the similarity of the redshifts and spectra .",
    "a second is that the values of cosmological and cluster model parameters are not as assumed in calculating the above numbers : key parameters are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and also parameters of the model such as the dependence of cluster halo concentration on mass , redshift and cosmology and the cosmic scatter in halo concentration ( for details see @xcite ) . or it may be that the models do not yet comprise the full complexity required to model accurately the statistics : possible deficiencies include the assumption of the @xcite mass profile ( see also @xcite ) and the assumption of a smooth distribution of mass . other departures from the standard cosmological model , such as the existence of non - gaussian fluctuations , could also modify the lensing probabilities .    for these reasons",
    "we believe it is imperative to test carry out observational tests of the candidate lensed systems presented here in order to test these models , rather than using the predictions of the models to argue against the interpretation of these systems as being lensed .",
    "previous searches have been undertaken for lensed qsos with comparable separations , and it is interesting to investigate whether the detection of any systems in 2qz would be inconsistent with those searches .",
    "@xcite searched a sample of size @xmath46 radio - loud qsos without finding any evidence for multiple images in the separation range @xmath47 .",
    "@xcite examined a complete sample of 11,670 flat - spectrum radio sources for possible multiple images separated in angle by @xmath48 and found no lensed systems .",
    "an incomplete sample of @xmath49 radio sources yielded one possible lensed system .",
    "the first step in comparing these results with those from the 2qz survey is to compare sample selection .",
    "the range of angular separations probed by the radio surveys is generally smaller than considered here , although had any 2qz pairs with @xmath39 been lens candidates they should have been identified as such . for comparison purposes we shall use the cluster - lensing model to compare surveys covering different ranges in separation ,",
    "although we have argued above that the overall lensing probabilities predicted by such models may be too low to explain the existence of more than one lensed system in the 2qz survey .",
    "the model of @xcite with parameters @xmath50 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath51 predicts relative lensing probabilities of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the separation ranges @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively , assuming the same magnification bias in each case .",
    "if the models are indeed deficient in some way , or if the values of parameters are different from that assumed , these relative probabilities will be different , but they suffice for the discussion in this section .    in fact , because of the double radio and optical selection of the first survey @xcite the magnification bias could be a factor 5 smaller for that survey compared with the jvas / class or 2qz surveys ( @xcite ) , so the overall expected relative lensing probabilities in the three surveys are @xmath58 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 for first , jvas / class and 2qz respectively .",
    "we also need to make some assumption about sample completeness and to multiply the probabilities by the sample sizes . here",
    "we shall adopt a conservative view of the jvas / class result and say that out of 15,000 qsos no lensed systems were found , and we adopt an assumed completeness of 50% for the 2qz survey . at this stage",
    "this figure is illustrative only . with these assumptions ,",
    "the predicted relative numbers of systems in each survey are 0.1 , 1.6 and 1.0 for the first , jvas / class and 2qz surveys respectively .",
    "now suppose the entire dataset contains one lensed system : the _ a posteriori _ probability of that system being found in the 2qz survey is 37% .",
    "however , if there are more systems in the 2qz survey , the probability of there being none in the other surveys falls to 13 , 5 , 2 % for 2 , 3 or 4 2qz systems .",
    "thus , if the surveys are indeed comparable in this way , the existence of two lensed systems within the 2qz survey would not be inconsistent with the other surveys , but a larger number could be .",
    "finally , however , we note that another possibly significant factor in calculating the expected lensing probabilities is the redshift distribution of the source population .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have demonstrated that cluster lensing probability strongly increases with the mean redshift of the source population , and also depends to some extent on the distribution of source redshifts about the mean .",
    "the redshift distribution is not well - known for the class and first surveys , but appears likely to have a median value in the range @xmath59 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 2qz median redshift is 1.5 .",
    "lensing probability increases by a factor about 3 as the source redshift is increased from @xmath60 to @xmath61 @xcite , so if the typical redshift of sources in the radio surveys is even slightly lower than that of qsos in the 2qz survey this would also lower the relative probability of discovering lensed systems in the radio surveys .",
    "our overall conclusion from this comparison is that , observationally , the results from the 2qz and radio surveys may not be incompatible , but clearly further work needs to be done both to establish more accurately the redshift distribution of the jvas / class sources and to establish the reality of the 2qz candidate systems .",
    "evidence has been presented for the discovery of the first lensed qsos with multiple images separated on arcminute scales . if these are genuine lensed systems then we should expect the associated lenses to be observable as massive clusters of galaxies .",
    "further evidence needs to be collected to establish that these are indeed lensed , however .",
    "one such piece of evidence that is independent of assumptions of the nature of the lens would be the existence of common ly-@xmath62 forest absorption in candidate lensed qso spectra .",
    "the existence of giant arcs associated with a system would also provide strong evidence for cluster lensing , especially if the host galaxies of the qsos could be detected and shown to be distorted by lensing .",
    "detection of the lens itself , either by direct imaging or weak - lensing , would also provide convincing evidence .",
    "consideration of the expected distribution of angular separations indicates that , although a number of the identified systems may be lensed , a number of those with the greatest separations may not be .",
    "confirmation or discounting of the widest separated systems is particularly important as any such systems would challenge our current understanding of lensing by galaxy clusters .    among the examples found ,",
    "one candidate lensed system has been found to display broad civ absorption in one image and not the other , which could be due to the formation of such absorption systems on timescales of tens of years .",
    "further searches for wide - separation lenses may be partially incomplete because such absorption systems would affect optical colours , spectra and the flux in other wavebands , including possibly the x - ray band",
    ". broad - line region variability may also render search methods based on colour and/or spectroscopic comparison partially incomplete unless generous selection criteria are allowed .",
    "finally , it may be that optical searches are biased against lenses with separations less than a few tens of arcsec because of obscuration in galaxies associated with the cluster lens .",
