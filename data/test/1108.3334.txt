    "the metal - line and molecular cooling , metal transport , and feedback included in our simulations also allow us to accurately represent the thermodynamics of the gas , which has been shown to have a significant effect on the evolution of the clumping factor .",

    "more recent studies have trended towards less clumping .",

    "photoelectric heating during photoionization causes the filaments to expand , lowering the density .",
    "the increased electron temperature also reduces the radiative recombination rate coefficient . the df method ( eq .  [ 13 ] ) includes no dependence on the recombination rate coefficient , and therefore only counts the effect of photoheating on the filament density .",

    "by @xmath141 , we find nearly identical clumping factors for both backgrounds .",
    "after a substantial recovery time , the redshift when the background is turned on is not important . before this recovery ,",
    "the clumping factor of the earlier background is lower by a factor of @xmath782 , resulting in earlier reionization .",
    "one can compare the strengths of feedback to reionization , where  positive feedback \" lowers the clumping factor and  negative feedback \" suppresses star formation .",
    "at @xmath218 the total stellar mass ( sfr density ) of simulation @xmath219 is 1.19 ( 1.13 ) times lower than that of simulation @xmath220 , while the clumping factor is 1.64 times lower .",
    "for simulation @xmath217 , the total stellar mass ( sfr density ) and clumping factor are 1.52 ( 1.49 ) and 1.66 , respectively , times lower than those of simulation @xmath220 .",
    "this suggests that the positive feedback introduced by the background is greater than the negative feedback .",
    "however , the stellar mass ( sfr density ) does not recover in the same manner as the clumping factor .",
    "once photoheating suppresses the formation of small - mass halos , the hubble flow takes over and prevents them from collapsing and forming stars .",

    "the major results of our study can be summarized with the following points :    1 .",
    "we calculated the critical star formation rate required to maintain a photoionized igm , incorporating four free parameters ( @xmath44 , @xmath11 , @xmath45 , @xmath303 ) that control the rates of lyc photon production and radiative recombination .",

    "an epoch of full reionization at @xmath0 is consistent with recent optical / ir measurements of sfr history and a rising igm neutral fraction at @xmath3 , marking the tail end of reionization .",
    "these observations include the decrease in numbers of high-@xmath12 galaxies and ly@xmath2  emitters and igm damping - wing intrusion into the ly@xmath2  transmission profiles in high-@xmath12 qsos .",
    "our newly developed sfr and reionization calculator , now available on - line at + http://casa.colorado.edu/~harnessa/sfrcalculator , allows users to calculate the ionization history , critical sfr , and cmb optical depth , and to assess whether observed sfrs , imfs , and other parameters are consistent with igm reionization .",
    "4 .   reconciling late reionization at @xmath0 with @xmath13 of the cmb",
    "likely requires an epoch of partial ionization .",
    "a fully ionized igm back to @xmath79 produces @xmath306 , and an additional optical depth , @xmath16 , may arise from early sources of uv / x - ray photons at @xmath17 .",
    "alternatively , one can appeal to the likelihood contours from wmap , which allow optical depths as low as @xmath307 ( 95% c.l . )",
    "the _ planck _ experiment may clarify the situation in several years .",
    "if the eor is more complex , as we suggest , then redshifted 21-cm experiments should focus on the interval @xmath308 , corresponding to frequencies 124167 mhz , for the maximum signal of igm heating ( @xmath309  mk ) produced when the hydrogen neutral fraction @xmath53 ( pritchard et  al .",

    "finally , we plan to carry out more detailed modeling of the  ( 21-cm ) signal , coupled to the kinetic and spin temperatures driven by heating at @xmath17 .",
    "as described earlier , the duration of the reionization transition and the 21-cm emission during the heating phase could provide discriminants of various sfr histories at @xmath24 .",
