    "one of the methods in imaging a turbid or a diffusive medium with optical radiation is the time - gating technique @xcite . in this technique",
    "a temporally narrow pulse is injected into the medium .",
    "owing to the diffusivity of the medium , when the pulse exits the medium it becomes considerably wider .",
    "however , if the first arriving photons are separated from the rest of the pulse then it is possible to use these , so called , ballistic ( or quasi ballistic ) photons to reconstruct the ballistic image of the medium .",
    "therefore , by employing a short time - gating technique the multi - scattering effect can be eliminated .",
    "indeed , such methods were employed in recognizing hidden objects and informative signals in diffusive media @xcite .",
    "naively , one might expect that this technique can be implemented for electron imaging to `` see '' absorptive objects inside scattering medium .",
    "that is , one can send a short pulse of electrons to one end of the medium , while at the other end only the first arriving electrons will be measured . by doing",
    "so all the noise caused by the multi - scattering should be eliminated . on the other hand , the presence of absorptive regions ( like imaginary potentials @xcite ) will be felt in the amount of the early arriving electrons .",
    "however , electrons are governed by the schrdinger equation , and unlike the maxwell wave - equation , has a parabolic dispersion relation . as a consequence ,",
    "any localized wave - packet suffers from strong dispersion , since each spectral component propagates at different velocity .",
    "the fastest particles are the most energetic ones , which pass through the medium unaffected , since the barrier s potential energy is negligible compared to their kinetic energy . in particular , when the medium is a certain barrier ( or well ) , we conclude that when only the first - arriving particles are measured there should be no trace of the barrier s presence . it does not matter what shape or height the barrier has - the first particles that pass though the barrier should be indifferent to it .",
    "thus , one may argue that the time - gating technique can not be implemented to electrons imaging , at least not in its naive form . however , we show that the short - time measurement reveals information about the",
    "_ _ n__ature of the barrier whether it is imaginary or real .",
    "there is a peculiar distinction between an absorbing medium ( e.g. , an imaginary potential ) and a non - absorbing one ( e.g. , a real potential ) .",
    "while they both have no effect on the wavepacket ( both transmitted and reflected ) at @xmath0 , the imaginary barrier influences the wavepacket sooner .",
    "in other words , in the temporal taylor expansion of the probability density the imaginary potential appears at smaller order than a real potential .",
    "it is then clear that we can classify the barrier as an absorptive one simply by measuring the wave - packet at short times .",
    "note that in general it is required to measure both reflection and transmission coefficients to figure out if the barrier is absorptive or not .",
    "recently @xcite , it has been demonstrated even experimentally that it is feasible to investigate the 1d scattering of a bose - einstein condensate by a narrow defect .",
    "therefore , it seems that there is a good chance of witnessing these effects in the laboratory in the near future .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate this effect rigorously ( both analytically and by a numerical simulation ) for the delta function potential .",
    "that is , we show that it is possible to identify an absorptive potential by measuring the short time dynamics of only the transmitted wavefunction .",
    "the initial state we consider is a wave - packet , which is confined to one side of the barrier .",
    "it is then demonstrated that the wavefunction at the other side is independent of the barrier for short times , while the temporal dependence depends on the exact nature of the barrier ( absorptive or not ) .",
    "evidently , in order to confine the initial wavepacket to one side of the barrier , there has to be a certain singularity in the wavepacket . in this paper",
    "we focus on a step function to simplify the problem ; however , it has been demonstrated elsewhere that most of the conclusions are valid even in the continuous case provided the measurements are taken at specific ranges ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "is is also demonstrated at the end of the paper that the main conclusions are valid even when the initial wavepacket is a gaussian . for simplicity we take a 1d delta function as the potential barrier .",
    "the system illustration is depicted in fig.1 .",
