    "neutron stars can be considered as resonators where various oscillation modes can be excited .",
    "these oscillations are attracting much attention because , in principle , they can be used to study the internal structure of neutron stars .",
    "some of them ( for instance , r - modes ) can be accompanied by gravitational radiation . because neutron stars are relativistic objects ,",
    "their oscillations must be studied in the framework of general relativity .",
    "the relativistic theory of oscillations was developed in a series of papers by thorne and coauthors @xcite .",
    "in particular , the rapid ( @xmath6 s ) damping of p - modes with multipolarity @xmath7 by gravitational radiation was demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "an exact treatment of general - relativistic effects is complicated , but in many cases it is possible to use the relativistic cowling approximation @xcite .",
    "an analysis of various oscillation modes and mechanisms for their dissipation was carried out by @xcite .",
    "let us also note the review paper by @xcite , which contains an extensive bibliography . as a rule ,",
    "one considers neutron star oscillations with low values of @xmath8 .",
    "although neutron stars are objects at the final stage of stellar evolution , they can be seismically active for many reasons .",
    "possible mechanisms for the generation of oscillations have been widely discussed in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , much attention has been paid to r - modes  vortex oscillations that can be generated in rapidly rotating neutron stars and accompanied by powerful gravitational radiation .",
    "in addition , oscillations can be excited in neutron stars , for example , during x - ray bursts ( nuclear explosions in outermost layers of accreting neutron stars ) , bursting activity of magnetars ( anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft gamma - ray repeaters ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and glitches ( sudden changes of spin periods ) of ordinary pulsars .    in this paper",
    "we focus of high - frequency ( @xmath2 khz ) pressure oscillations ( p - modes ) with high multipolarity @xmath9 localized in neutron star envelopes ( crusts ) . in our previous paper @xcite we have studied these oscillations for @xmath10 . in that case",
    "p - modes are localized in the outer envelope ( before the neutron drip point , at densities @xmath11 g  @xmath12 ) , where the equation of state ( eos ) of stelar matter is relatively smooth .",
    "accordingly , the oscillation spectrum is simple and well established .    in the present paper",
    "we extend our analysis to p - modes with lower @xmath8 .",
    "these oscillations penetrate into the inner envelope of the star , where the eos undergoes considerable softening due to neutronization and becomes more complicated ( essentially different for ground - state and accreted matter ) .",
    "we show that the neutron drip affects strongly the oscillation spectrum .",
    "if detected , this spectrum would give valuable information on the eos in neutron star envelopes and also on global parameters of neutron stars ( their masses and radii ) .",
    "following @xcite we study oscillations localized in a thin neutron star envelope .",
    "it is convenient to use the approximation of a plane - parallel layer , and write space - time metric in the envelope as @xmath13 where the local time @xmath14 and local depth @xmath15 are related to the schwarzschild time @xmath16 and circumferential radius @xmath17 by @xmath18 @xmath19 is the circumferential radius of the stellar surface , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are spherical angles , @xmath22 is the gravitation radius , and @xmath3 is the gravitational mass of the neutron star .",
    "the metric ( [ metric ] ) is locally flat and allows us to use the newtonian hydrodynamic equations for a thin envelope with the gravitational acceleration @xmath23 the pressure in the envelope is primarily determined by degenerate electrons and neutrons ( in the inner envelope ) , being almost independent of temperature @xmath24 .",
    "accordingly , we can use the same zero - temperature eos for the equilibrium structure of the envelope and for perturbations . employing this eos",
    ", we neglect the buoyancy forces and study p - modes . the linearized hydrodynamic equations ( for a non - rotating star )",
    "can be rewritten as ( see , e.g. , the monograph by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the velocity potential and @xmath27 is the squared sound speed . the velocity potential can be presented in the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an oscillation frequency , and @xmath30 is a spherical function ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an unknown function @xmath31 obeys the equation @xmath32 the boundary condition at the stellar surface is @xmath33 .",
    "it comes from the requirement of vanishing lagrange variation of the pressure at the surface .",
    "the formal condition @xmath34 in the stellar interior should be imposed to localize oscillations in the envelope .",
    "of course , the actual variable @xmath15 is finite and the real depth of oscillation localization will be controlled in calculations .",
    "the eos of matter in neutron star envelopes contains a sequence of first - order phase transitions associated with changes of nuclides with growing density .",
    "these phase transitions are relatively weak ( the density jumps do not exceed 20 per cent ) .",
    "we should add boundary conditions at all phase transitions within the envelope .",
    "these are two well known conditions at a plain boundary of two liquids @xcite .",
    "the first condition can be written as @xmath35 it ensures equal radial velocities at both sides of the boundary .",
    "the second condition is @xmath36 it comes from the requirement of pressure continuity at the boundary .",
    "note , that the boundary conditions ( [ bound1 ] ) and ( [ bound2 ] ) provide a source of buoyancy which leads to the density discontinuity of g - modes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "oscillations of a plane - parallel layer for a polytropic eos ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 being the polytropic index ) were studied analytically by @xcite . in this case , the squared sound speed is @xmath39 .",
    "the solution for eigenfrequencies is @xmath40 and eigenmodes are given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a generalized laguerre polynomial @xcite , and @xmath43 is the number of radial nodes .",
    "note , that the mode with @xmath44 does not have any radial nodes ; its properties are independent of the polytropic index @xmath38 .",
    "this mode corresponds to the vanishing lagrangian variation of the density ( incompressible motion ) .",
    "adding the condition @xmath45 to eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) , one can easily show that the mode with the frequency @xmath46 and the eigenfunction @xmath47 , defined by eq .",
    "( [ fk ] ) , is the proper mode for a wide class of eoss .",
    "note , that the boundary conditions ( [ bound1 ] ) and ( [ bound2 ] ) are automatically satisfied for this mode , and it is continuous at phase transitions .",
    "the oscillation frequency redshifted for a distant observer is @xmath48 the frequency @xmath49 will be used to normalize eigenfrequencies of other p - modes .",
    "the number of radial nodes @xmath50 will be used to enumerate the modes .",
    "let us use the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath51 and transform eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) taking the equilibrium pressure @xmath52 as an independent variable , @xmath53 the boundary conditions ( [ bound1 ] ) and ( [ bound2 ] ) can be written as @xmath54 therefore , eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ bound1 p ] ) , ( [ bound2 p ] ) and with regularity requirement can be treated as the equation for an eigennumber @xmath55 containing the scaling parameter @xmath56 ( with @xmath57 for @xmath58 ) .",
    "accordingly , the eigenfrequencies can be written as @xmath59 here , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are functions which can be calculated numerically .",
    "they are universal for all neutron stars with a given eos in the envelope .",
    "the velocity potentials @xmath62 are also universal functions of @xmath52 .",

    ", we use the eos of @xcite ( hz ) .",
    "it was derived by following transformations of atomic nuclei ( beta captures , emission and absorption of neutrons , pycnonuclear reactions ) in an accreted matter element with increasing the pressure .",
    "the eos was calculated for the densities from @xmath69 g  @xmath12 to @xmath70  g  @xmath12 . for lower densities",
    ", we have taken the matter composed of @xmath71 and the eos of degenerate electrons with electrostatic corrections . for higher densities ,",
    "we use the eos of the ground - state matter presented by @xcite ( bps ) because , as remarked by @xcite , the hz eos becomes very similar to the bps eos at @xmath72 g  @xmath12 .",
    "we have also considered envelopes composed of the ground - state ( cold catalyzed ) matter . in the outer envelope we use the eos of @xcite ( hp ) and the recent eos of @xcite ( rhs ) . for the inner envelope",
    ", we employ the eos of @xcite .    phase transitions in these eoss",
    "have been treated carefully using the boundary conditions ( [ bound1 ] ) and ( [ bound2 ] ) at any phase transition . for comparison ,",
    "we have also employed the model of the outer envelope composed of ground - state matter with a smoothed composition ( the smooth composition model  scm ) . in the latter case",
    "we have included only a large density jump at the neutron drip boundary between the inner and outer envelopes .",
    "the squared sound speed @xmath73 as a function of depth @xmath15 for all these eoss is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cs2 ] .",
    "the solid line is for the accreted envelope ; the dashed , dotted and dash - and - dot lines are for the hp , rhs and scm eoss of the ground - state matter .",
    "the different versions of the ground - state eos show approximately the same sound speed profiles , but the profile in the accreted envelope is significantly different .",
    "the depth of the accreted envelope ( up to the density @xmath74 g  @xmath12 , which is the largest density in the envelope , where the atomic nuclei are present , for the bps eos ) is @xmath75  m. for all models of the ground - state matter , the largest density in the envelope has been taken @xmath76  g  @xmath12 ; the envelope depth is @xmath77  m.      figures [ fig_omegaccreted ] and [ fig_omegground ] show squares of dimensionless eigenfrequencies @xmath78 versus multipolarity @xmath8 for accreted and ground - state envelopes of the canonical neutron star . because of the scaling ( [ scaling ] ) the figures can be easily transformed to a star with any gravity @xmath79 and radius @xmath4 by changing scale of the @xmath8 axis by a factor of @xmath80 .    for any envelope , the modes with @xmath81 can be subdivided into two groups , with a pronounced linear dependence and with a weak dependence of @xmath78 on @xmath8 . as will be shown in section [ subsec_eigenprofs ] , the modes of the first type ( _ the inner modes _ , shown by thicker lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_omegaccreted ] ) are localized in the vicinity of the neutron drip point , while the modes of the second type ( _ the outer modes _ ) are localized in the outer envelope . in figs .",
    "[ fig_omegaccreted ] and [ fig_omegground ] one can see a number of quasi - intersections .",
    "when passing through a quasi - intersection point ( with growing @xmath8 ) , an inner mode gains an additional radial node , but an outer mode loses one .",
    "let us consider the outer modes .",
    "the eigenfrequencies are the same ( within @xmath82 ) for all ground - state eoss ( see fig.[fig_omegground ] ) . for the accreted envelope ,",
    "eigenfrequencies are larger because the eos is stiffer . with decreasing @xmath8 ,",
    "oscillations penetrate deeper into the outer envelope , where the eos is softer because electrons become relativistic , and because they undergo beta - captures .",
    "it leads to a gradual decrease of @xmath78 .",
    "as in the model with the polytropic eos , given by eq .",
    "( [ omegak ] ) , separations between squares of neighboring dimensionless eigenfrequencies @xmath78 are approximately constant for a fixed @xmath8 . the weak decrease of separations with the growth of @xmath50 is due to the penetration of oscillations into deeper layers of the star , where the eos is softer .",
    "the latter effect is more pronounced for the ground - state matter owing to a stronger softening of the eos .",
    "finally , at @xmath83 the outer p - modes are localized in the outer layers of the outer envelope , where the matter is composed of @xmath84fe nuclei for both accreted and ground - state eoss .",
    "accordingly , eigenfrequencies become nearly equal .",
    "naturally , the oscillation frequencies of outer modes with @xmath85 for the ground state envelope are the same as calculated by @xcite .    to demonstrate explicitly that inner modes are caused by the neutron drip in the inner envelope , in fig .",
    "[ fig_omegmodel ] we present eigenfrequencies for a model envelope without any neutron drip . here",
    "we employ the rhs eos in the outer envelope but assume that the inner envelope is composed of @xmath86se ions ( the last element at the outer envelope ) and electron gas ( no free neutrons ) .",
    "the oscillation spectrum does not contain any inner modes . a small decrease of @xmath78 for @xmath87 is produced by the softening of the eos at the bottom of the outer envelope .",
    "the growth of frequencies at @xmath88 is caused by the penetration of oscillations into the inner envelope , where our model eos is polytropic ( with the index @xmath89 ) .",
    "accordingly , oscillation frequencies tend to the values provided by the polytropic model ( [ omegak ] ) .",
    "if detected , outer modes would give us @xmath90 , and therefore @xmath91 ; see eq .",
    "( [ omega0_dist ] )",
    ". a detection of the only one fundamental mode ( @xmath44 ) would be sufficient to determine @xmath91 .",
    "a detection of several outer modes ( with different @xmath8 and/or @xmath50 ) would confirm and strengthen this determination .",
    "our calculations show that for the inner modes the ratio @xmath92 is a linear function of @xmath8 . using the scaling relation ( [ scaling ] ) we can present this linear dependence in the form @xmath93 here , @xmath94 is the surface gravity in units @xmath95  cm  s@xmath66 , @xmath96 cm=@xmath97 km , while @xmath98 and @xmath99 are dimensionless constants determined by the eos in a neutron star envelope .    for the canonical neutron star with the ground - state envelope , we obtain @xmath100 and @xmath101 in the case of inner modes with lowest frequencies . for the same star with the accreted crust we have @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the values of @xmath104 allow us to determine @xmath99 . in this way we obtain @xmath105",
    "hence , the difference between the ground - state and accretion envelopes is quite pronounced in oscillation spectra .",
    "therefore , if several ( minimum two ) inner modes could be detected in addition to outer modes , their frequencies could be fitted by a function ( [ innfit ] ) and the values of @xmath98 and @xmath104 could be determined .",
    "an accurate determination of @xmath98 would enable one to distinguish between the ground - state and accretion envelopes .",
    "the value of @xmath104 would give then @xmath106 . combining this @xmath106 with the value @xmath107 , determined from the detection of the outer modes ,",
    "one would get a simple system of two equations for two unknowns , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "thus , a detection of one outer mode and several inner ones could in principle enable one to discriminate between the ground - state and accreted envelopes and determine neutron star mass and radius .",

    "this value of @xmath8 is very close to the quasi - intersection point for the modes with 4 and 5 radial nodes ( see fig .  [ fig_omegaccreted ] ) .",
    "the subdivision into the outer and inner modes is clear  the modes with @xmath1150 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 radial nodes are localized in the outer envelope , but the energy of the mode with @xmath1154 is concentrated in the outer part of the inner envelope .",

[ fig_cs2 ] ) and increase their energy density in this region . however , the increase is not so large as for the inner modes .",

    "the modes with @xmath1150 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 are localized in the outer envelope ; the energy of the modes with @xmath1152 and 6 is concentrated near the neutron drip point .",
    "the subdivision of modes is the same as suggested in section [ subsec_eigenfrec ] on the basis of figure [ fig_omegground ] .",
    "the energy profiles of the second and third modes are very close for @xmath123  m , but for @xmath124  m the energy density differs by more than three orders of magnitude .",
    "qualitatively the same feature is demonstrated by the fifth and sixth modes .",
    "the outer modes ` respond ' to the lowering of the sound speed after the neutron drip point by increasing the energy density in this region . this increase is greater for the second and fifth modes whose frequencies are close to the frequencies of the inner modes .",
    "however , it is not so large as for the inner modes .",

    "we have studied high - frequency pressure oscillations which are localized in the envelopes of neutron stars composed of the accreted or ground - state matter .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the oscillations are almost insensitive to various modifications of the eos for the ground - state matter ( section [ subsec_eigenfrec ] ) .",
    "all eoss we have used ( hp , rhs , scm ) give the same oscillation spectrum .",
    "\\(2 ) the neutron drip and associated softening of the eos in the inner envelope do not affect strongly the spectrum of the well known ( outer ) oscillation modes which are localized predominantly in the outer envelope ( section [ subsec_eigenfrec ] ) .",
    "\\(3 ) however , the neutron drip leads to the appearance of inner oscillation modes localized mostly near the neutron drip point ( section [ secres ] ) .",
    "the spectrum of these modes is sensitive to the eos in the envelope ( accreted or ground - state ) .",
    "\\(4 ) the p - mode oscillation problem is self - similar ( in the plane - parallel approximation ) .",
    "once the problem is solved for one stellar model , it can easily be rescaled to neutron star models with any mass and radius ( but the same eos in the envelope ; see section [ subsecmodescale ] ) .",
    "\\(5 ) a detection and identification of one outer mode and several inner modes would enable one to discriminate between the ground - state and accreted envelope and determine neutron star mass and radius ( section [ sect : infer ] ) .",
    "for example , a detection of the fundamental mode with @xmath127 at the frequency 74 khz and of two inner modes with @xmath128 and @xmath127 at 56 khz and 140 khz , respectively , would indicate a canonical neutron star with the ground - state envelope .    therefore , high - frequency pressure modes are excellent tools to explore the physics of matter in neutron star envelopes and to determine masses and radii of neutron stars",
    ". the oscillation frequencies could be detected by radio - astronomical methods very precisely .",
    "a detailed analysis of pulse shapes of some radio pulsars reveals that oscillations with large multipolarity are possibly excited there @xcite but their frequencies are @xmath12930 hz , so that they are not high - frequency p - modes we discuss here .    a search for high - frequency p - modes could be useful .",
    "high - multipolarity p - modes do not damp very quickly because they do not produce any powerful gravitational or electromagnetic emission ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "they are robust because they are relatively independent of the thermal state of the star , and they should not be strongly affected by neutron star magnetic fields .",
    "the inner p - modes , localized in the inner envelope , could be easily triggered by pulsar glitches , which are thought to occur just in inner envelopes of pulsars .",
    "@xcite studied the dissipation of p - modes localized in the outer envelope ; this dissipation is mainly produced by the shear viscosity .",
    "it may be enhanced by thin viscous layers near numerous nuclear phase transitions .",
    "the viscosity in these layers can be diffusive or turbulent .",
    "note , that fundamental modes do not produce viscosity layers because they pass phase transitions without velocity discontinuities ( see sec .",
    "[ secformal ] ) .",
    "their dissipation is not enhanced by phase transitions .",
    "finally , p - modes in neutron star envelopes are relatively insensitive to the eos and composition of neutron star cores",
    ". however , these modes can be useful to discriminate between ordinary neutron stars and strange stars with crust .",
    "the latter stars are thought to contain extended cores composed of strange quark matter .",
    "nevertheless , a core is assumed to be surrounded by an envelope of normal matter ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that a strange star with the crust may look like an ordinary neutron star from outside . the density of the normal matter in a strange star does not exceed the neutron drip density .",
    "the pressure modes in the envelopes of such stars should easily ` feel ' underlying dense quark matter , and the oscillation spectrum would reflect the presence of the quark core .",
