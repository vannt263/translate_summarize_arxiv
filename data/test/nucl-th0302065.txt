    "the properties of loosely bound nuclei have been studied in nuclear physics for a number of years . in particular",
    "some electromagnetic processes , such as certain charged particle capture reactions , are very interesting in themselves as they are of vital importance in astrophysical scenarios .",
    "unfortunately , at stellar energies , the cross sections for these reactions are very small due to the coulomb barrier and direct measurements are therefore extremely difficult .",
    "instead one has to rely on theoretical extrapolations from experimentally accessible energies down to stellar ones .",
    "an alternative , indirect method to investigate radiative capture reactions , is to study electromagnetic dissociation ( emd ) on heavy targets  @xcite .",
    "this technique gives an enormous increase in yield due to the huge amount of virtual photons produced by the high-@xmath1 target , the more favorable phase space factor , and the possibility to use thicker targets . in principle",
    "it should therefore be possible to measure the cross section at very low relative energies .",
    "there are , however , also disadvantages with the indirect method ; the most important being the admixture of @xmath2-transitions with different multipolarities whereas the direct capture process , in most cases , should be completely dominated by e1 transitions . since the cross sections for radiative capture and photo - dissociation",
    "are related via detailed balance for each separate multipole , it is necessary to have knowledge of the strengths of different multipole transitions in the emd reaction .",
    "the problem of extracting the e1 contribution from a measured emd energy spectrum remains a challenge to the nuclear physics community . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proposed to study the angular or momentum distributions of the breakup fragments .",
    "the idea was to employ the fact that interference terms , between e1 and e2 excitation amplitudes , will produce an asymmetry in these distributions .",
    "this method was , e.g. , used in the analysis of @xmath0  emd  @xcite where the e2 excitation amplitude , calculated within first - order perturbation theory , was renormalized in order to reproduce the asymmetry of the measured @xmath3longitudinal momentum distribution .",
    "however , as was already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the asymmetry due to e1-e2 interference strongly depends on the final state interaction ( fsi ) between the breakup fragments ; or in other words , on the structure of the continuum up to relatively large energies .",
    "moreover , terms which contribute to the asymmetry do not contribute to the integrated cross section from which the astrophysical @xmath4-factor is extracted . finally , for low beam energies , higher - order dynamical effects will lead to a reduction of the asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "therefore we conclude that , if we are interested in astrophysical applications of emd experiments , it is desirable to look for more stable , and less model dependent , characteristics than the asymmetries of angular and momentum distributions . in this paper",
    "we will present two novel methods to extract the e1/e2 ratio from emd experiments .",
    "we will use an analytical approach based on a two - cluster picture of the nucleus , but the effects of many - body structure will also be included .",
    "our approach will be general in the sense that both neutron - rich and proton - rich systems can be studied .",
    "this model was first presented in  @xcite while similar approaches also exist for one - neutron  @xcite and two - neutron  @xcite halo nuclei .",
    "although advanced numerical investigations are readily performed utilizing present day computer power , an analytical approach might have an advantage when exploring general physics features , and the sensitivity to different model assumptions .    the physics case which will be investigated throughout this paper",
    "is the @xmath0  nucleus .",
    "the interest in @xmath0  stems from its key role in the production of high - energy solar neutrinos .",
    "it is well - known that the probability for the reaction @xmath5 at solar energies strongly depends on the structure of @xmath0  and , in particular , on the asymptotics of the valence proton wave function ( wf ) .",
    "this reaction has been studied indirectly through emd , using a radioactive @xmath0  beam impinging on a heavy target  @xcite .",
    "note that the question of e2 contributions to the experimental spectra was addressed differently in all these investigations .",
    "we should also mention the recent progress in radiative capture measurements  @xcite , where the cross section has been measured at energies around 200 kev with an accuracy of @xmath6 percent .",
    "nevertheless , in all cases theoretical models are needed to extrapolate the measured cross sections down to solar energies .",
    "theoretical studies of the low - energy behavior of the astrophysical @xmath7-factor has been presented by many authors , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following : section  [ sec : theory ] contains a summary of the theoretical framework that will be used in the calculations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] our analytical model wfs are presented and discussed in quite some detail . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : emd ] we discuss the model dependence of calculated emd energy spectra and propose two new methods to extract information from emd experiments .",
    "our starting point for calculating electromagnetic cross sections will be the @xmath8 strength function for a transition from a bound state ( total spin @xmath9 ) to a continuum state with energy @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the phase space element for final states , @xmath13 is the electric multipole operator and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the bound and continuum states in the center of mass system .",
    "we will consider loosely bound systems of two clusters @xmath16 and , in particular , we will study transitions to the low - energy continuum in which excitations are manifested as relative motion between the clusters @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the reduced mass of the two - body system .",
    "introducing the intercluster distance @xmath19 , the corresponding cluster @xmath8 operator ( operating only on the relative motion of clusters ) is @xmath20 where we have also introduced the effective multipole charge @xmath21 .",
    "the strength function is the key to study several reactions .",
    "for example , the cross section for photo - dissociation @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 ^ 2 } \\left ( \\frac{e_\\gamma}{\\hbar c }    \\right)^{2\\lambda -1 } { \\ensuremath{\\frac{\\mathrm{d } b ( \\mathrm{e}\\lambda ) } { \\mathrm{d}e } } } , \\label{eq : xsecgamma}\\ ] ] where the photon energy @xmath24 is larger than the binding energy @xmath25 . from this formula",
    "the inverse radiative capture reaction @xmath26 can be studied using detailed balance @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the spin of particle @xmath29 .",
    "note that the probability for direct capture of charged particles is dramatically reduced at low energies due to the coulomb barrier in the @xmath30 channel .",
    "the cross section is therefore usually factorized into the gamow penetration factor and the @xmath4-factor @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the sommerfeld parameter .",
    "the dominant part of the energy behavior is carried by the gamow penetration factor while , e.g. , nuclear structure information is incorporated into the @xmath4-factor .",
    "finally , we will consider the process of emd on a high-@xmath1 target .",
    "using first - order perturbation theory , and the method of virtual quanta  @xcite , the energy spectrum can be written as a sum over multipole @xmath33 photo - dissociation cross sections multiplied by the corresponding spectra of virtual photons @xmath34 @xmath35 note that , except in the vicinity of corresponding resonances , m@xmath36 transitions are usually strongly suppressed  @xcite . therefore , we will not study them in this work .",
    "a straightforward calculation of the electric multipole matrix element for a direct transition between a loosely bound state and a non - resonant continuum state , shows that the radial integrand rises to a maximum value at a radius which is , in most cases , many times the nuclear radius .",
    "thus , these processes will mainly probe the surface structure of the nucleus . furthermore , `` loosely bound '' implies that the nucleus will exhibit a large degree of clusterization and that the relative motion wf between the core and the valence nucleon will have an extended tail .",
    "the final , continuum state will contain both coulomb and nuclear distortions . for low continuum energies , and when the binding energy of the initial state is small , the nuclear distortions can be neglected in a first approximation .",
    "therefore , we will only consider a pure coulomb continuum in our analytical model , i.e. , all nuclear phase shifts will be put equal to zero .",
    "the effects of nuclear distortions in @xmath0  emd will be considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : emdmodeldep ] .",
    "thus , a continuum state , with relative orbital momentum @xmath37 between the clusters , will be described by a normalized , regular coulomb function @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the coulomb phase , @xmath41 is the sommerfeld parameter , @xmath42 is the confluent hypergeometric function  @xcite , and @xmath43    the reduced matrix element introduced in the definition of the strength function , eq .  , contains a radial integral . with our approximation for the continuum state",
    "this integral takes the form @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the two - body , relative motion wf describing the initial , bound state . at large @xmath19 ,",
    "with relative orbital momentum @xmath46 between the clusters , this radial function should be proportional to the whittaker function @xmath47 , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the binding energy .    in most studies on loosely bound systems ,",
    "the whittaker function has been used to describe the bound state for all @xmath19 .",
    "however , the whittaker function behaves as @xmath50 in the limit @xmath51 , and therefore this approximation is only motivated if the transition matrix element is dominated by contributions from very large @xmath19 .",
    "this is the case for reactions at very small energies ; while for real experimental energies ( @xmath52  kev ) , the wf of the bound state should be constructed in a more realistic way .",
    "our idea is therefore to introduce a model function that describes the bound state @xmath53 wf accurately for all distances .",
    "this can be achieved by considering the behavior at small and large @xmath19 .",
    "we have already pointed out that the wf should be described by a whittaker function at large @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , the expected @xmath54 behavior for a two - body system consisting of point - like particles is @xmath55 .",
    "both asymptotics are fulfilled using the following model function @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the normalization constant and @xmath58 denotes the parameters @xmath59 .",
    "the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 are defined by the binding energy , charges , and masses , while @xmath62 can be fitted to give the correct distance between particles @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( or the correct size of the system ) . using this wf , and solving the integral   numerically ,",
    "it is possible to get very good estimates for the electromagnetic reaction cross sections .",
    "we should also mention that in the limit @xmath65 we are actually able to solve the radial integral   analytically , except for the normalization constant @xmath57 .",
    "however , we are searching for a completely analytical model which will also enable us to incorporate many - body effects .",
    "our model function has to be modified accordingly .",
    "first , we note that the asymptotic form of the whittaker function as @xmath66 is @xmath67 .",
    "\\label{eq : asympwhit}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] secondly , for two - body systems in which the clusters have an internal structure , the centrifugal barrier is effectively larger and the wf should behave as @xmath68 ( where @xmath69 ) as @xmath54 .",
    "motivated by this , we put forward the following model function @xmath70 with norm @xmath71 where @xmath2 denotes the parameters @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is an integer fulfilling @xmath74 .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 is defined by the binding energy and effective mass . by putting @xmath75",
    "we would ensure to reproduce the tail of the wf at very large @xmath19 .",
    "however , the difference between an exact whittaker function and its asymptotic behavior ( first term of eq .  ) remains important for @xmath76  fm .",
    "therefore , @xmath77 and @xmath62 are used as free parameters in a fit to the `` exact '' wf   in the interval of interest . in this way",
    "@xmath77 will be an _ effective _ sommerfeld parameter while @xmath62 will still mainly be connected with the size .",
    "note that if @xmath78 , then the second term in eq .   will be negative and consequently we will find that @xmath79 . finally , the integer @xmath73 is fixed by the small @xmath19 behavior . for a pure two - body system we will use @xmath80 ( where @xmath81 is the closest integer to @xmath64 ) , while we can take many - body effects into account by putting @xmath82 .",
    "with this model wf it is possible to solve the integral   exactly @xmath83 many - body nuclear structure can further be taken into account by considering the possibility that the bound state wf contains several different two - body components @xmath84 which can be seen as two - body projections of the many - body wf .",
    "note that pure many - body components will not contribute to two - body breakup and , as a result , we will have @xmath85 .",
    "note also that the threshold for two - body breakup will be higher for components where one ( or both ) of the clusters is excited .",
    "therefore , we define the continuum strength function separately for each component . finally , we arrive at an analytical formula for the strength function of component @xmath29 @xmath86      the special case where @xmath87 , i.e. , a one - neutron halo system will lead to several simplifications .",
    "first of all we will have @xmath88 and the whittaker function in eq .",
    "will transform into a modified , spherical bessel function @xmath89 furthermore , the continuum solution will reduce from a coulomb function   to the corresponding component of a plane wave @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a spherical bessel function . in this case , the integral   can be solved exactly .",
    "consider , e.g. , a node - less @xmath92 state , for which our model wf would read @xmath93 with norm @xmath94 the radial integral   for this special case will be given by @xmath95      we will now apply our model to the @xmath0  nucleus .",
    "the low - lying @xmath0continuum can , with relatively good precision , be approximated as a pure coulomb one .",
    "at least there are no negative parity states at low excitation energies  @xcite and the electromagnetic processes are , in all cases we are considering , dominated by @xmath97 transitions . however , we will also show that the influence of a broad negative parity state at high excitation energy  @xcite is not negligible at intermediate ( @xmath98  mev ) continuum energies .    in a first approximation",
    "the bound state of @xmath0  can be treated as a pure two - body ( @xmath99 ) system with binding energy @xmath100  kev and relative orbital momentum @xmath101 .",
    "the single free parameter @xmath62 in our `` exact '' model function   was then fitted to an rms intercluster distance of @xmath102  fm ( extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to get analytical results",
    ", we then introduced the model function  .",
    "we put @xmath103 and fixed @xmath60 from the binding energy , while the remaining parameters @xmath62 and @xmath77 were fitted to the behavior of the `` exact '' model wf , see table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the resulting e1 strength function is shown as a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : e1strength ] .",
    "this analytical approximation agrees very well with numerical results obtained keeping the `` exact '' model wf . the error is less than 2% in the region of interest .    . although the total strengths are the same in these examples , the shapes are very different when treating the @xmath0  nucleus as a two - body ( dotted line ) or a three - body ( solid line ) system .",
    "the difference is mainly due to the stronger centrifugal barrier in the three - body case ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which forces the wf to be narrower in coordinate space and thus wider in momentum / energy space . the parameters of the model wfs can be found in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",

    "note that there is no dependence on the particular value of the channel spin in the two - body case .",
    "[ tab : parameters ] [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , concerning the structure of the @xmath0  ground state one should keep in mind that the @xmath3  core is in itself a weakly bound system with an excited @xmath114 state at 429  kev .",
    "the common treatment of @xmath0as a pure two - body system is therefore questionable .",
    "we want to investigate what effect the many - body structure of @xmath0  might have on the strength function . for this purpose",
    "we utilize a recent three - body ( @xmath115 ) calculation  @xcite where it was shown that , after projection onto the two - body channels , there are three main components ( adding up to 94% of the total wf , see table  [ tab : parameters ] ) and that the rest are pure three - body channels .",
    "for each of the numerical two - body overlap functions we fit our parameters @xmath62 and @xmath77 .",
    "the binding energy , @xmath116  kev , determines @xmath60 for the two first components and @xmath117  kev for the third , @xmath3  excited state , component .",
    "the best fit to the small @xmath19 behavior is obtained with @xmath118 which reflects the effectively larger centrifugal barrier in the three - body case .",
    "this centrifugal barrier will push the wf away from @xmath119 and will , thus , force it to become more narrow than the corresponding two - body wf .      using the two - body wf  , which describes correctly the binding energy and the geometry , we are able to restore the corresponding two - body potential . besides centrifugal barrier and coulomb interaction",
    ", the potential also contains an attractive part which we find can be approximated with a high accuracy by one or two yukawa - type potentials .",

    "the emd of loosely bound nuclei , impinging on a high-@xmath1 target , has been used in nuclear physics for many years both in order to investigate nuclear structure and as an indirect method to extract information on radiative capture reactions .",
    "unfortunately , as for all reaction experiments , a lot of information is contained in the experimental results and it is a hard task to disentangle the desired part .",
    "the transition matrix elements represents the probability for an initial state wave function to end up in a specific final state after being filtered through the reaction mechanism .",
    "naturally , both the structure of the initial as well as the final state are important for this quantity .",
    "in addition , further complications arise if nuclear induced breakup contributes to the measured cross section , and/or if the interaction time is long enough for higher - order transitions to become important . therefore , in order to minimize interference from higher - order dynamical effects and from nuclear interactions , we will be interested in high - energy experiments in which events characterized by large impact parameters have been selected .    in this section we will demonstrate that the analysis of emd energy spectra from loosely bound nuclei is highly model dependent",
    ". we will then discuss the important issue of how to separate the contributions from specific multipoles ; a problem which is of great significance when extracting information on the inverse , radiative capture reaction .",
    "applying our analytical model to study emd using first - order perturbation theory enables us to investigate the sensitivity of the energy spectrum to some properties of the initial bound state . at small relative energies the electromagnetic processes are highly peripheral , which means that the interaction mainly probes the external part of the bound state wf . as a consequence ,",
    "the amplitude of the emd cross section should depend crucially on the size of the nuclear system .",
    "a larger size implies a lower coulomb barrier , which results in a larger tunneling probability , and consequently a larger cross section .",
    "however , the radii of nuclei far from stability are usually extracted from interaction cross section measurements , and this procedure has unfortunately proven to be highly model dependent . a glauber - type analysis , assuming a uniform density distribution , results in a smaller radius as compared to an analysis in which the few - body structure is taken into account explicitly  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the relevant parameter for two - body breakup is in reality the intercluster distance rather than the total matter radius , and the relation between these two quantities is also model dependent . in a pure two - body model",
    "one often assumes that the size of the core is equal to the size of the corresponding free nucleus .",
    "in contrast , taking many - body structure into account will result in polarization effects .",
    "for example , it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the average distance between @xmath122 is approximately 10% smaller inside @xmath0(studied in a @xmath123 picture ) than in a free @xmath3nucleus ( @xmath124 picture ) .",
    "we have investigated the sensitivity of the emd cross section to the rms intercluster distance by performing model calculations with a @xmath0-like system . a pure two - body system with @xmath101 relative motion ( having unity spectroscopic factor ) was assumed and a binding energy of 0.137  mev was used .",
    "the effective sommerfeld parameter was fitted to the asymptotic behavior of  , i.e. , to the whittaker tail .",
    "the size of our model wf   was then a function of the remaining free parameter @xmath62 . by varying this parameter",
    "we could investigate the sensitivity to the size and from fig .",
    "[ fig : stot ] it is clear how strong it is . just for illustration : a 15% uncertainty in the rms intercluster distance ( which , in our model , would correspond to 5% uncertainty in the @xmath0  matter radius ) results in @xmath125% ambiguity of the calculated total cross section .     of our two - body model wf was varied in order to change the rms distance between the @xmath3  core and the valence proton .",
    "a beam energy of 82.7  mev / nucleon and a minimum impact parameter of 30  fm was used .",
    "[ fig : stot],width=302 ]    let us now consider the difference between a two - body and a three - body approach . as was mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : b8wf ] , the effectively larger centrifugal barrier in a three - body system will push the relative motion wf away from @xmath119 and consequently force it to become more narrow than the corresponding two - body wf for a given radius .",
    "we therefore expect the distribution in momentum / energy space to be broader .",
    "this effect is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : e1strength ] where the @xmath0  e1 strength functions , obtained using our three - body   and two - body analytical model wfs , are compared .",
    "this difference , seen in the strength function , should be even more pronounced in the energy spectrum since it will be magnified by the spectrum of virtual photons .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsde ] we compare different calculations of @xmath0  emd on pb , including both e1 and e2 transitions , to the experimental data from davids  et  al .",
    "this experiment is very appealing since the selection of scattering angles ( @xmath126 , which corresponds to a minimum impact parameter of @xmath127  fm ) minimizes the contribution from nuclear scattering , and the relatively high beam energy ( 82.7  mev / nucleon ) justifies the use of first - order perturbation theory .",
    "let us first compare our analytical two - body ( dotted line ) and three - body ( solid line ) results , see also ref .",
    "@xcite . concerning the shape of the energy spectrum we have an excellent agreement between the experimental data and our results obtained using the three - body model , while the pure two - body calculation gives a too narrow peak .",
    "as to the absolute values , the three - body energy spectrum is approximately 20% above the experimental data .",
    "however , the most important lesson from this comparison is that for two different assumptions concerning the nuclear structure , but keeping the rms intercluster distance fixed , we obtain very different shapes of the calculated energy spectra .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the interpretation of energy spectra is highly model dependent .",
    "a final remark in connection to this observation is that , in order to interpret experimental data correctly , it is very important to fix the spectroscopic factors of different two - body and many - body components .",
    "therefore , we want to stress the usefulness of experiments where emd is studied in complete kinematics . examples of interesting channels in the @xmath0  case is @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "some progress has already been made in this direction .",
    "recently , @xmath3  fragments and @xmath2-rays were measured in coincidence after breakup on a light target by cortina - gil  et  al .",

    "all theoretical curves have been corrected for experimental resolution and acceptance . [",
    "fig : dsde],width=302 ]    we have also performed numerical calculations , based on first - order perturbation theory , where the numerical @xmath0  bound state wf from  @xcite was used . in the first investigation we assumed a pure coulomb continuum and the results of this calculation is shown as a long - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsde ] .",
    "we note that the obtained energy spectrum compares rather well with our analytical three - body model except for a 15% difference in the peak height . since our analytical model has the correct asymptotic behavior for large @xmath19 and a three - body behavior at small @xmath19 , the main difference to the numerical wf should be in the intermediate region , and this is exactly the region which dominates the transition matrix elements for energies corresponding to the peak of the energy spectrum .",
    "this fact explains the observed discrepancy .    in our second numerical investigation",
    "we studied the influence of @xmath99 fsi .",
    "as previously mentioned , the low - energy continuum of @xmath0  is dominated by positive parity states  @xcite which are only relevant for e2 ( @xmath13010% of the total cross section ) and m1 transitions .",
    "note that the latter only plays a role in the vicinity of the narrow @xmath131 resonance at 0.64  mev above threshold , and is therefore not included in our calculations .",
    "however , the possible existence of a very broad negative parity state at high excitation energy can still have a strong influence on the energy spectrum .",
    "effects of such a state was observed in a recent elastic proton scattering experiment  @xcite from which the authors made a @xmath132 spin - parity assignment and , from an @xmath133-matrix analysis , they obtained a best fit with the parameters @xmath134  mev and @xmath135  mev .",
    "we have included such a broad continuum structure by adding an attractive potential in the @xmath92-wave channel .",
    "the effects of this are clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsde ] ( short - dashed line ) : the total cross section is reduced and the continuum strength is redistributed towards smaller energies .",
    "we conclude this comparison by stating that a broad negative parity structure in the high energy continuum has a non - negligible influence on the emd energy spectrum for energies @xmath98  mev and that the parameters of such a state are still to be determined with greater accuracy .      as we have seen in the previous section",
    "the main model uncertainties in the emd analysis are : the asymptotic normalization constant which depends on ( i ) the radius in combination with ( ii ) the spectroscopic factors of different two - body components ; ( iii ) the underlying many - body structure , and finally ; ( iv ) the fsi . despite the difficulties connected with measuring the cross section at small relative energies",
    ", we still suggest to focus on the low-@xmath10 part of the energy spectrum . in this way one can avoid uncertainties associated with fsi ( unless there are resonances very close to threshold ) and with the many - body behavior of the wf at small intercluster distances",
    ". the asymptotic normalization constant in combination with the spectroscopic factor will enter as an absolute normalization of the cross section .",
    "however , since this normalization affects all multipole transitions equally it is possible to calculate the ratio of two different multipoles with a very good precision .",
    "we have investigated the ratio @xmath137 and found that it is almost model independent at small relative energies . to demonstrate this we will continue to use the emd of @xmath0(on a pb target at 82.7 mev / nucleon with @xmath138  fm ) as an example .",
    "reusing the different model calculations from sec .",
    "[ sec : emdmodeldep ] we can investigate the sensitivity of the ratio to different model assumptions .",
    "firstly , in fig .  [",
    "fig : dsderatio ] we can see that the difference between a two - body and a three - body approach is less than 3% in the region of interest . this low sensitivity can be explained by the fact that the low-@xmath10 part of the spectrum mainly probes the large @xmath19 asymptotics of the radial wf . shown in fig .",

    "it is clearly seen that the influence from fsi is almost negligible at small relative energies where the numerical results and our analytical three - body model seem to converge .",
    "unfortunately , the numerical accuracy of our calculations becomes questionable at small energies and the calculated ratio is therefore only plotted down to 0.1  mev .",
    "in this context we want to stress that in our analytical model we are able to calculate the relevant transition matrix elements for all energies , including the limit @xmath139 .",

    "[ fig : dsderatiorad ] , the sensitivity of the @xmath141 ratio   to the intercluster distance is also very small .",
    "this feature is also expected since the intercluster distance determines the asymptotic normalization of the wf which , in turn , cancels when the ratio is calculated .",
    "however , as can be seen in the insets of figs .",

    "the inset shows the same curves for a broader energy range .",
    "[ fig : dsderatiorad],width=302 ]    one final question is well - founded : since the transition matrix elements for very small energies depend mainly on the tail of the bound state wf , is it still justified to use our model wf   which has merely an approximate description of the whittaker tail ?",
    "the result of our numerical calculation ( remember that the numerical bound state wf has the correct asymptotics ) presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : dsderatio ] indicates that it is justified , since it seems to converge with the analytical model for small @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , in the limit @xmath139 we are actually able to solve the radial integral   exactly even for the `` exact '' wf   which has a whittaker tail .",
    "we find that @xmath144 calculated with the model wf and with the `` exact '' wf agree within 0.5% .",
    "this result gives an additional justification to the use of our model wf for calculating transition matrix elements at small @xmath10 .    in summary",
    "we have found that the calculated @xmath141 ratio of the energy spectrum is almost model independent at small relative energies . in first - order perturbation theory",
    "this ratio can be expressed as @xmath145 where we have introduced the e2/e1 ratio of photo - dissociation cross sections @xmath146 naturally , the ratio @xmath141 will depend on the experimental conditions such as beam energy and minimum impact parameter .",
    "however , this dependence enters only in the spectra of virtual photons which are easily calculated for any experimental conditions @xmath147 ( see , e.g. , eq .  ( 4.7 ) of  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the ratio of @xmath0  photo - dissociation cross sections @xmath148   does not depend on the experimental conditions .",
    "therefore , we provide this ratio , calculated within our analytical three - body model , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigphotoratio ] . the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigphotoratio ] can approximately be described by the formula @xmath149 which describes the calculated curve with an accuracy of @xmath150% in the region @xmath151  mev . from this formula",
    "it is easy to obtain @xmath141 using eq .",
    ", width=302 ]      one of the beauties with the method of virtual photons is the separation of reaction kinematics and nuclear excitation dynamics into the spectrum of virtual photons and the photo - absorption cross section , respectively .",
    "this separation can be used as an alternative method to extract the e1 contribution from the measured cross section .",
    "the objective is to use the fact that the cross section will depend on beam energy and minimum impact parameter only through the spectra of virtual photons .",
    "first , let us introduce the notation @xmath152 where we have indicated that the spectra of virtual photons are functions of the beam energy and minimum impact parameter .",
    "in reality this dependence enters in the adiabaticity parameter @xmath153 assuming that the total cross section is dominated by e1 and e2 transitions we find that the energy spectrum for given experimental conditions @xmath154 is given by @xmath155 where we would like to remind the reader of the relation @xmath156 .",
    "now we can use the fact that the virtual photon spectra depends differently on @xmath157 for different multipoles to extract the contribution from one of the multipoles .",
    "let us assume that we have two sets of experimental data from the same experimental setup ; the only difference being the beam energy and/or the selected scattering angles ( minimum impact parameter ) . the e1 contribution to one of the measurements",
    "can then be obtained with the formula @xmath158 the advantage of this method is that information can be obtained directly from experimental data .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the formula is only valid under the assumptions of first - order perturbation theory and straight - line trajectories .",
    "thus , this method can only be used for emd at relatively large beam energies where events characterized by large impact parameters have to be selected .",
    "furthermore , the experimental conditions must be chosen so that the difference @xmath159 is observable and larger than the experimental uncertainty .",
    "in this paper we have studied electromagnetic processes involving loosely bound nuclei . to this aim",
    "we have developed an analytical model which is based on the use of radial model functions that give a realistic description of two - body wfs ( or the two - body projections of many - body wfs ) for all radii , see also  @xcite .",
    "we have used this model to study emd of @xmath0 , but have also indicated how it can be applied to other reactions and other nuclei .",
    "for example , it should provide an important tool to investigate the low - energy behavior of the astrophysical @xmath4-factor .",
    "we have also presented numerical calculations based on the three - body model of @xmath0 , developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and on recent experimental information on a broad negative parity state in the @xmath0continuum . combining the results of our analytical model , and of these numerical calculations , has allowed us to investigate the sensitivity of calculated emd energy spectra to different model assumptions .",
    "we concluded that the magnitude of the cross section depends strongly on the intercluster distance and on the spectroscopic factors of different many - body channels ; while the shape of the energy spectrum is very sensitive to the few - body structure .",
    "finally , we found that a broad negative parity state at high excitation energy will influence the energy spectrum for energies @xmath98  mev , and will lead to a reduction of the cross section .",
    "however , the main purpose of this paper has been to investigate the problem of how to extract the e1 contribution from a measured emd energy spectrum .",
    "this question is of great significance for the gathering of information on astrophysically interesting radiative capture reactions from emd experiments ( note the relation between the e1 component of the emd energy spectrum and the astrophysical @xmath4-factor via eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xsecrc][eq : xsecemd ] ) ) .",
    "the main method so far has been to study the asymmetries in angular or momentum distributions . however , this asymmetry ( which is due to e1-e2 interference ) depends strongly on details of the fsi which , in turn , are often relatively unknown .",
    "furthermore , the e1-e2 interference terms do not themselves contribute to the integrated cross sections to which the @xmath4-factor is related . instead",
    ", we have proposed two novel , and less model dependent , approaches to extract the e1 contribution from a measured emd energy spectrum : ( i ) firstly , we demonstrated that the ratio of emd cross sections @xmath160 is almost model independent at small relative energies .",
    "we also provided an analytical formula to calculate this ratio for any experimental conditions .",
    "( ii ) secondly , we demonstrated how two sets of experimental data , obtained with different @xmath161 and/or @xmath162 , can be used to extract the e1 component .",
    "this method relies on the fact that the strengths of different multipole components depend on the beam energy and minimum impact parameter , and in first - order perturbation theory this dependence enters only in the virtual photon spectra .",
    "since the proposed two methods are not directly connected to each other , they can be used independently and the results can be compared to each other .",
    "however , both methods , but in particular the first one , require that the energy spectrum is measured down to very small relative energies ( 100300  kev ) , which will probably prove to be a difficult challenge ."
