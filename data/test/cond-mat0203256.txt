    "in the risk minimisation of portfolio optimisation it is very important to consider how the returns of different companies correlate with each other . for this purpose",
    "the study of the equal time cross correlations between stocks has attracted much interest  @xcite : the clustering properties and the comparison between the time and ensemble averages have provided much useful information in this respect .    in statistical physics _",
    "time dependent _ correlations are also of major interest . due to their role in the fluctuation dissipation theorem",
    "they constitute as the main tool for determining transport coefficients .",
    "the famous onsager reciprocity relations have their roots in the symmetry properties of the time - dependent cross correlations  @xcite .",
    "obviously , in an economic system there is no reason to assume that the time reversal symmetry or detailed balance is maintained .",
    "nevertheless , it is of interest to investigate the time dependent cross correlations between stock returns because they contain information about the way how the prices influence each other , which are the dominant stocks and to what extent this dominance is reflected in the price changes under the conditions of an efficient market .",
    "the time dependent correlations between the indices of different stock exchanges were already studied empirically by @xcite and with a microscopic model by @xcite .",
    "they showed that there exists a time shift in the cross - correlations which arises from the fact that the different stock markets are open in different time cycles during the day as the earth rotates .",
    "in this article we study time - dependent cross correlation functions of the returns of different stocks taken from the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) .",
    "as we will show , in many cases the maximum of the correlation as a function of time is not at zero but shifted , meaning that there exists some `` pulling '' effect between the companies , _",
    "i.e. , _ one of them influences the price behaviour of the others .",
    "however , this effect can not be strong and the shift should be small , otherwise the effect could be utilized for arbitrage purposes , which is excluded from an efficient market .",
    "in fact , the investigated cases do not contradict with these criteria .",
    "the time dependent correlation between the stocks was studied before by @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite seems to contradict with ours because they studied weakly returns , and they found significant cross - correlations on the weakly scale .",
    "however , the results agree considering the `` pulling '' effect , namely that the cross - correlations are asymmetric .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we give a short description of the data set . in section 3",
    "we present the method of analysis and show how it works on an artificial set of data .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the presentation of the results .",
    "the paper terminates with a discussion .",
    "one of the stylized facts of markets is that the auto - correlation of stock returns decays exponentially with a very short characteristic correlation time , which is in the range of a few minutes @xcite .",
    "this is understood as a signature of market efficiency@xcite . since cross correlations",
    "could also be used for arbitrage , one should not expect effects much beyond the above scale and therefore high frequency data are needed .",
    "we have analyzed the trade and quote ( taq ) database for @xmath0 days over the time period from 01.12.1997 to 09.03.1998 , which includes tick - by - tick data for about 10000 companies . since this is quite a short time period we selected only those companies which were traded more than 15000 times such that the number of companies reduced to 195 .",
    "having these 195 time series we have to face the following problem : since the tradings do not happen simultaneously , the values of the returns have also to be defined for the time intervals between the tradings . according to the rules of the stock exchanges we have considered the price as constant between two changes",
    "the whole trading time @xmath1 during one day is divided into @xmath2 small intervals or windows of size @xmath3 .",
    "if the trading happens in the interval @xmath4 the return takes the value @xmath5",
    "\\over \\ln\\left [ p(t-\\delta t ) \\right]}\\   \\nonumber , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for simplicity the day index @xmath6 is not indicated ; otherwise it is zero .    in order to avoid the problem of major return values stemming from the differences between opening and previous day s closing prices we simply took the days as independent , _",
    "i.e. _ , the averaging is separated into two steps : over the intraday trading time @xmath1 and over the trading days .",
    "the data prepared in this way were then analysed from the point of view of time - dependent cross correlations .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we want to investigate the correlation of returns as the function of the time shift between pairs of stocks return time series .",
    "the definition of the time - dependent correlation function @xmath7 is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the variance of the return .",
    "the notation @xmath10 means averaging over the whole trading time @xmath1 and important details of this process will be given in the following .",
    "since the smallest interval between two tradings is one second , then @xmath11 seems to be a natural choice .",
    "however , for such a short window it quite often happens that at a given time step there is no transaction for one of the stocks ( or for both ) such that the return results in a zero contribution to the total correlations .",
    "since the number of non - zero contributions is small , the correlation coefficients as a function of the time shift , @xmath12 , will strongly fluctuate . to avoid this problem one has to enlarge the time difference , @xmath13 , and average the correlations over the starting points of the returns . in this way",
    "the average in eq .",
    "( [ correl_def ] ) means the following @xmath14 where the first sum runs over the starting points of the returns and the second one runs over the @xmath13 wide windows of the returns . in order to illustrate the effect that by taking larger time difference it is easier to identify the peaks in the correlation function  in other words to locate the time which gives the maximal correlation  we simulated two series of artificial data sets",
    "the first is a one dimensional persistent random walk ( prw )  @xcite , which deviates from a normal rw by the fact that the probability , @xmath15 , that it jumps in the same direction as in the previous step is higher than @xmath16 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the random walker remembers its history .",
    "the probability of an increment @xmath17 at time @xmath4 is @xmath18 the other time process is simply generated from the first one by shifting it by @xmath19 and adding to it gaussian random noise with zero mean and width @xmath20 : @xmath21 the advantage of this model is that the correlation function can be calculated analytically and the position of the maximum correlations can be adjusted at @xmath19 : @xmath22 after generating the two data sets we randomly drop points from both sets and keep only the fraction @xmath23 of the points in order to have the same problem as with the original data sets that the jumps do not occur at the same time in the different time series .",
    "it is apparent from fig.[artificial ] .",
    "that increasing the time difference , @xmath13 helps identifying the time of maximum correlation .",
    "the fact that we dropped random points from the original data changes slightly the position of the maximum correlation as compared to eq.([anal_artific ] ) .",
    "fig.[artificial ] .",
    "shows that the decay of the correlation function is not exponential as in eq.([anal_artific ] ) but it decays approximately linearly down to the noise level .",
    "this is due to the averaging procedure we use with the increased time difference , @xmath13 .",
    "the correlation corresponding to larger time difference @xmath24 can be written as the weighted sum of the one - step correlation functions , @xmath25 , which belongs to @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the return belonging to one second time difference .",
    "changing @xmath12 in eq.([correl_atiras ] ) means changing the weights of the one - step correlation functions . since the correlation function of the original data sets , see eq.([anal_artific ] ) , decays exponentially , the maximum , @xmath29 , will give the main contribution to the sum in eq.([correl_atiras ] ) and because its weight is linear in @xmath12 , then @xmath24 will decay approximately linearly .",
    "( it should be noted that the normalization factor in eq.([correl_def ] ) does not change this consideration since it is independent of @xmath12 . )",
    "there is only one question left namely how can we choose a smaller value for @xmath12 than for @xmath13 ?",
    "the time dependent cross correlation of the returns contains a product of the _ return _ of company a with that of company b shifted by @xmath12 .",
    "as the return is defined with the window @xmath30 the values of @xmath31 could only be multiples of @xmath13 .",
    "the solution is simply that one shifts the starting point of the return of company b by @xmath12 , as evident in eq .",
    "( [ correl_average ] ) , i.e. we make the time shift in the price function and in this way allow any time shift larger than the minimum trading time .",
    "the above arguments of averaging give support to choose a value for @xmath13 that is larger than the minimum trading time .",
    "however , it should not be too large since the averaging leads then to the smearing out of the maximum . as the width of the one - step correlation should be a few minutes",
    ", much larger time difference would mean that in the sum of eq.([correl_atiras ] ) we mainly have terms , which are only due to noise .",
    "this suggests that the optimal choice for @xmath13 is of the order of magnitude of one minute .",
    "as mentioned in sec . [ data ] we have studied the correlation of 195 companies , which were traded during the available 54 days more than 15000 times . in accordance with the arguments presented in the previous section we have used @xmath32 but checked that the results are quite robust within the range @xmath33 . as already mentioned , we averaged over the starting points of the returns .",
    "for the maximum of the time shift we choose @xmath34 .",
    "this is definitely beyond any reasonable characteristic time for correlations in return values because of market efficiency .",
    "in fact , using such a large value for the time shift allows us to measure the noise level , which the possible effect should be compared with .    for the resulting 195 * 194/2 correlation functions we measured the maximum value , @xmath35 , the position @xmath36 at which time shift this maximum was found , and the ratio , @xmath37 , of the maximum and strength of the noise defined as the variance of the correlation values for time shift values between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we looked at those pairs of companies for which these three values exceeded a prescribed threshold values , which we defined for @xmath40 as : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "one example of the measured correlation function can be seen in fig .",
    "[ esv - xon ] . in this case",
    "the company xon ( exxon )  which is a large oil company ",
    "`` pulls '' the esv ( ensco international ) which provides drilling service to oil and gas companies .",
    "this effect is quite weak but the large value of @xmath37 shows that it is significant .",
    "the maximal value of the correlations turn out to be quite small , in average less than 0.1 , ( _ e.g. _ see fig . [ esv - xon ] ) , although the generally quoted equal time cross correlations have much larger values .",
    "the root of this effect lies in the choice of the time difference , @xmath13 . increasing @xmath13 increases the values of the equal time correlations @xcite .    in some cases",
    "the position of the maximum correlation was found at values much larger than few minutes which would be inconsistent with the efficient market behavior .",
    "a closer inspection revealed that in such cases the peak in the correlation function is caused by two major return values in the considered time series .",
    "the contribution of their product to the correlation  at appropriate value of the time shift  dominates the maximum of the correlation function .",
    "these are not the effects we are looking for , therefore we did not take them into account . in order to check whether the peak in the correlation is due to some single large return value or due to persistent influence of one of the stocks on the other we also studied how the correlation changes if the analyzed time window changes .",
    "we measured the shifted time correlation also for the first and for the second half of the given 3 month period and studied whether the correlation function remains qualitatively the same .",
    "we also measured the correlation for shorter and for larger time difference , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , because it may happen that by changing the time difference also the position of the maximal correlation value changes due to the averaging procedure described in eq.([correl_atiras ] )",
    ". this can happen if the time dependent correlation function for @xmath13 has an asymmetric peak ; see fig .",
    "[ fre - tmx ] .",
    "let us suppose that the left hand side is higher than the right hand one . for @xmath46 the maximum will be shifted towards left as it can be shown through simple examples using eq.([correl_atiras ] ) . in the case of fig .",
    "[ esv - xon ] the correlation function is also asymmetric but not at its peak ( not near the maximum ) , which means that the maximum will not be shifted by increasing the time difference , @xmath13 .",
    "the results show that the characteristic time shift is around 100 sec .",
    "which is consistent with the effective market hypothesis .",
    "a time shift larger than the characteristic time of the decay of the return auto - correlations would contradict with the efficient market picture and could be used to arbitrage .",
    "in general the more frequently traded companies are influencing ( `` pulling '' ) the less frequently traded ones .",
    "this is not surprising since obviously the more frequently traded companies are more important .",
    "it is therefore more likely that they influence a smaller company than the other way around .",
    "although this is the generic situation , there are a few exceptions when a less often traded company `` pulls '' the other one .    in this study we found that in general one `` small '' company is influenced by many `` large '' companies and one `` large '' company pulls many `` small '' ones . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ arrow ] this behaviour can be represented as a graph of directed links , where there are nodes from which many links go out ( meaning that this node is influenced by many others ) and there are other nodes where many links go in ( these are the big companies influencing the less important ones ) .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the time dependent cross correlation functions of the returns of stocks at the nyse .",
    "we have studied whether there exists any pulling effect between stocks , i.e. , whether at a given time the return value of one stock influences that of another stock at a different time .    in general we can see two types of mechanisms to generate significant correlation between two stocks :    * some external effect ( e.g. economic , political news etc . ) that influences both stock prices simultaneously . in this case",
    "the change for both prices appears at the same time , and the maximum of the correlation is at zero time shift .",
    "* one of the companies has an influence to the other ( e.g. one of the company s operation depends on the other . ) . in this case",
    "the price change of the influenced stock appears later in time because it needs some time to react on the price change of the first stock , in other words one of the stocks pulls the other .",
    "this pulling effect has been the main focus of our study in this article .",
    "since the correlation between stocks was expected to be small and the available set of data was somewhat limited we had to do a careful analysis .",
    "for this reason and test purposes we generated an artificial data set with which we showed that by increasing the time window of the returns and by averaging over their starting points the detection of the correlation effect gets easier .    with the real data we saw that it is possible to find pairs of stocks where the pulling effect exists , though it turned out to be small .",
    "in addition , the characteristic time shift - given by the position of maximum correlation - was found to be of the order of a few minutes .",
    "these findings are compatible with the efficient market picture .    as for the pulling effect we found that generically the more traded , and thus more important companies pull the relatively smaller companies .",
    "this result is consistent with that of @xcite . in this light",
    "it is not surprising that in the study of the time - dependent cross correlation functions of pairs of companies in the dow jones industrial average index no pulling effect was found .",
    "this underlines the fact that the dow jones companies are indeed among the most important stocks of the new york stock exchange .    finally we would like to propose that",
    "although the observed pulling effect was small , our careful analysis could show that it is significant for a considerable set of pairs of companies .",
    "we think that this property of the stock market should be added to the so called stylized facts . of course",
    ", further analysis on more extensive data is needed to clarify further details of the time dependent cross correlations .",
