    "non - linear piezoelectricity and its importance in iii - v semiconductors and nanostructures has been a topic of intense debate over the last few years .",
    "@xcite the existence of non - negligible second - order piezoelectricity in gaas and inas was first proposed by bester _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in the context of linear - response density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "it was soon revisited semi - empirically by migliorato _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite using harrison s bond orbital model and a strain - dependent kleinman parameter @xmath0 calculated from dft .",
    "more recently , following bester s methodology , beya - wakata _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have extended the calculation of first- and second - order coefficients to other zinc - blende ( zb ) iii - v binaries .",
    "although failing for lower band gap materials due to the intrinsic limitations of the local density approximation ( lda ) ,  @xcite the approach by bester _",
    "et al_.  @xcite provides , for the higher energy gap iii - v materials , _ ab initio _ parameters without need to fit to experiment . given that measuring piezoelectric ( pz ) constants accurately is complicated , in particular when possibly large second - order effects are superimposed to the linear ones , the importance of theoretical calculations can not be overstated .",
    "it was indeed found by beya - wakata _ et al .",
    "_ ,  @xcite and is confirmed in the present work with the use of an improved energy functional , that second - order effects are large for the family of zb iii - v materials , in some cases dominating over first - order piezoelectricity even for small strains ( e.g. alp , alas and inp ) .",
    "however , it remains unclear and hidden beneath the numbers what is the physical origin of this large second - order pz effect , and what is the reason for the apparent lack of trends in the evolution of the coefficients for the different compounds .",
    "@xcite we try to address this question here by looking separately at the different factors which contribute to the pz coefficients , investigating separately the linear and nonlinear contributions to the kleinman parameter and to the material electronic response , as well as noting the influence of volume effects on the pz coefficient values .",
    "the form of the second - order pz polarization tensor for the zb lattice , along with all the remaining pz crystal classes , has been established by grimmer based on symmetry arguments .",
    "@xcite the full expression for the pz vector of a zb lattice , including first- and second - order effects , reads :  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the linear pz coefficient , while @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the second - order pz coefficients .",
    "the strain components are denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "we follow standard voigt notation for all the symbols .",
    "previous analysis by beya - wakata _ et al .",
    "_ ,  @xcite found that @xmath3 and @xmath4 show no obvious trend with compound .",
    "we note that the two terms in the first ( @xmath7- ) component of the polarization vector [ eq .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) ] involving these two second - order pz coefficients are proportional to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "however , it is often more useful and intuitive to describe the response of a material in terms of the hydrostatic strain @xmath10 and the biaxial strain @xmath11 .",
    "equation  ( [ 01 ] ) can then be rewritten as  @xcite @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 related to the more usual coefficients as follows : @xmath15 while trends in @xmath3 and @xmath4 alone are difficult to extract ,  @xcite we find that @xmath13 and @xmath14 tend to decrease and to increase , respectively , with increasing unit cell volume .",
    "these opposing trends then account for the difficulty to identify any clear trends in @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "overall , we show that , once the non - linear dependence on strain of the bond polarity , in terms of charge redistribution and internal strain effects , is taken into account , a complete explanation of the pz effect , including its non linearity , can be provided from first principles alone .",
    "we present a consistent picture of ionicity in zb materials , drawn from the well - established relation between the dynamics of wannier function centers and electric polarization .",
    "@xcite although data on pz coefficients is somewhat lacking for zb semiconductors , more reliable measurements are available for the urtzite iii - ns . a very recent study of elastic and pz properties of wz gan by witczak _",
    "et al_.  @xcite serves as validation of the methodology employed here , which we already followed in refs .   and , respectively .",
    "recent work by tse _",
    "et al_.  @xcite relying on the harrison model computed the effective pz coefficient of gaas and inas using a third - order expansion in strain , which corresponds for a fourth - order expansion for the polarization",
    ". however , the authors neglected the quadratic contributions arising from shear strain ( related to the @xmath5 coefficient ) which , as we will show , are of the same order of magnitude as the other second - order contributions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce our computational method in sec .",
    "the main results are then presented in sec .  [",
    "this is followed by an analysis of the results in sec .  [ 22 ] , where we provide some general considerations in sec .  [",
    "15 ] , before discussing the first - order and second - order coefficients in secs .",
    "[ 16 ] and [ 17 ] , respectively . finally , we summarize our conclusions in sec .  [ 23 ] .",
    "some additional details of the calculation method used are presented in the appendix .",
    "equations  ( [ 01 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) portray all the symmetries applicable to piezoelectricity which are characteristic of the zb lattice ,  @xcite and therefore form the basis of the target quantities being calculated here .",
    "the dft calculations for geometry optimization and self - consistent wave functions were carried out using the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse ) hybrid functional approach  @xcite within the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method  @xcite as implemented in the vasp package .",
    "@xcite the screening parameter @xmath16 was fixed to 0.2 in our calculations and the mixing parameter @xmath17 to 0.25 ( these settings correspond to vasp s hse06 version of the hse functional ) .",
    "the plane - wave cutoff energy was set to 600  ev . the semicore @xmath18 states of ga and in were treated as valence states .",
    "a @xmath19-centered configuration was used for the @xmath20-point mesh , with a variable number of divisions .",
    "the convergence of the pz coefficients was found to be slow with respect to the number of * k * points , as described further in the appendix . table  [ 04 ] shows the calculated energy gaps and lattice parameters for all the compounds considered .",
    "the calculations of electric polarization were performed employing the berry - phase technique within the context of the modern theory of polarization ,  @xcite as implemented by martijn marsman in vasp .",
    "we have successfully used a similar approach previously to study internal strain and electric polarization of wurtzite group - iii nitrides .",
    "@xcite    [ 04 ]    [ cols=\">,^,^,^,>,^,^,^,>,^,^,^ \" , ]     another important consideration that becomes immediately clear from eq .",
    "( [ 08 ] ) is the volume effect present in piezoelectricity , whereby the lattice parameter enters the expression of the pz coefficient as @xmath21 .",
    "this factor varies for the zb iii - v compounds between 0.023  @xmath22 for insb and 0.052  @xmath22 for aln , so that at equal dipole moment per atom pair , this volume effect would enhance the pz coefficient of aln by more than a factor of 2 compared to insb .",
    "the second - order internal strain parameters in zb , which we call @xmath23 , can be obtained in a similar way to the kleinman parameter  @xcite and the wurtzite internal strain parameters ,  @xcite expanding the expression of the interatomic energy to third - order in strain and evaluating the different terms : @xmath24 equation  ( [ 10 ] ) can also be expressed in terms of hydrostatic and biaxial strain : @xmath25 it is unsurprising that eqs .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 25 ] ) resemble the expressions of the second - order pz polarization [ cf .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) , respectively ] .",
    "we will not report their values for all the iii - vs here .",
    "they can however be computed from the second - order _ ionic _ pz coefficients in table  [ 03 ] in a similar manner to the linear one : @xmath26 and @xmath27 where the term involving @xmath28 in the different @xmath29s comes from the change in volume due to the hydrostatic strain .",
    "looking at the coefficients for @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 in table  [ 03 ] , and taking the scaling factor @xmath33 from eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) into account , it can be seen that the second - order internal strain shows only a relatively small variation between the different binaries , as was also the case for the kleinman parameter ( table  [ 09 ] and the bar charts in fig .",
    "[ 18 ] ) .",
    "the equivalent expressions for the center of mass of the wannier centers are : @xmath34 and @xmath35 using the expression for the second - order internal strain , eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) , together with the first order one , eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) , allows to construct strain - dependent analogues of @xmath0 and @xmath36 as a function of hydrostatic and biaxial strain : @xmath37 with @xmath38 it can be seen from the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in table  [ 03 ] that the magnitude of @xmath39 tends to increase with decreasing volume ( @xmath40 ) , as would be expected from the bonds becoming more rigid with decreasing volume .",
    "by contrast , @xmath39 has a much weaker dependence on biaxial strain , @xmath41 .",
    "we can in addition combine the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ 08 ] ) in the following form : @xmath42 the second - order contribution to the pz response then depends both on the evolution of @xmath43 and of @xmath44 : if @xmath44 was independent of strain then it would be impossible for @xmath45 to change sign with increasing strain . in fig .",
    "[ 12 ] we plot the variation of the strain - dependent parameter @xmath43 ( left ) and the strain - dependent ratio @xmath44 ( right ) for all the zb iii - vs , as a function of both hydrostatic strain ( change in volume ) and biaxial strain .",
    "we see in the left hand figure for @xmath43 that contours of constant @xmath43 are generally close to vertical , highlighting that the hydrostatic strain has a considerably stronger effect than biaxial strain on the effective kleinman parameter .",
    "the right figure elucidates how strain induces a transition ( denoted by the white region in the color maps , for which @xmath46 ) from a negatively charged to a positively charged anion in all the compounds except for the nitrides ( only gan at very high tensile hydrostatic strain sees this transition for the range shown ) . for many of the compounds",
    "this transition occurs remarkably close to the zero strain region , which highlights the importance of the second - order pz coefficients .",
    "we also note that the contours of constant @xmath47 are close to vertical for the iii - nitrides , becoming more tilted toward the bottom right hand corner of the figure , reflecting the trend previously noted that @xmath13 tends to decrease and @xmath14 tends to increase with increasing compound s unit cell volume .",
    "it is worth noting also that the nitrides retain their ionic character , a fact that is also reflected in their relatively constant born effective charge when compared to other iii - v compounds .",
    "in summary , we have calculated hybrid - functional first- and second - order pz coefficients for the whole family of zinc - blende iii - v semiconductors .",
    "the hybrid - functional approach allows a more accurate evaluation of structural parameters and , more particularly , of band gaps .",
    "other dft approximations predict a negative band gap for some of these compounds which prevents the calculation of a meaningful electric polarization .",
    "we have reported the pz coefficients split into their ionic and electronic contributions and have shown how the large second - order corrections to the first - order coefficients arise from the extremely delicate balance between these two large components .",
    "we have built a phenomenological model of the pz effect in the iii - vs that allows a straightforward interpretation of first- and second - order effects in terms of changes in internal strain and ionicity . while we find changes in internal strain to be largely dominated by hydrostatic strain alone , changes in ionicity are found to be also strongly sensitive to biaxial strain .",
    "these changes are more pronounced as the unit cell size increases : they are smallest for aln and largest for insb .",
    "the authors acknowledge financial support from science foundation ireland ( project numbers 10/in.1/i2994 and 13/sirg/2210 ) , the european union s 7th framework programme deepen ( grant agreement no .",
    "604416 ) , and computational resources from the tyndall national institute s in - house computer cluster .",
    "the convergence of the electric polarization , and therefore of the pz coefficients , is rather slow with respect to the number of * k * points used in the calculation .",
    "this becomes problematic with the highly demanding hse functional , where typical computational times are one to two orders of magnitude higher than standard implementations of kohn - sham dft .",
    "the effect of the finite @xmath20 sampling on the data affects both the slope at zero strain and the curvature of the polarization , that is first- as well as second - order pz coefficients . even for a large number of * k * points ( @xmath48 )",
    "the derived values are not fully converged .",
    "we have found , however , a clear asymptotic behavior as the number of * k * points grows , as can be inferred from fig .  [",
    "02 ] for gasb under homogeneous shear deformation ( @xmath49 ) for different @xmath20 grids .",
    "the non - zero value of the polarization at zero strain in this case can be observed to be a numerical error due to finite @xmath20 sampling .",
    "however , the error is consistent for the different data points within the same series and therefore the extracted pz coefficients are independent of it . in this context , the values of the extrapolated pz coefficients have been obtained assigning different weights to the coefficients obtained with different precision , with the lowest weight assigned to those obtained with @xmath50 @xmath20 meshes and the highest weights corresponding to the denser @xmath48 @xmath20 meshes .",
    "intermediate @xmath51 and @xmath52 meshes have also been considered . in the lda ,",
    "an additional number of * k * points is specifically required for materials for which a ( wrong ) negative band gap is predicted , as is the case of gasb , inn , inas and insb .",
    "beya - wakata _",
    "et al_. , for instance , used a very dense @xmath53 @xmath20 mesh to obtain their lda results .",
    "@xcite in our hse calculations all the iii - vs studied retain a nearly correct ( as compared to experiment ) positive gap , as shown in table  [ 04 ] .",
    "this renders the matter of @xmath20-point density less critical .        to compensate for finite @xmath20-mesh sampling , we assume that the absolute value of the numerical error @xmath54 in either @xmath55 or @xmath56 due to finite brilloin zone integration decays exponentially with the number of * k * points @xmath57 used in the calculation : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    for the linear coefficient @xmath2",
    ", we assume the error is 50% for the @xmath59 mesh and 1% for the @xmath60 mesh .",
    "for the non - linear coefficients @xmath56 these errors are assumed to be 100% and 5% , respectively .",
    "these numbers yield @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the linear coefficients and @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the non - linear ones .",
    "then the coefficients are obtained , for each strain branch , as a weighed average of the four available values ( corresponding to @xmath20-meshes @xmath59 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath60 ) , with weights @xmath67 . the final coefficient presented in this paper",
    "is obtained as the average of these values between the different strain branches used .",
