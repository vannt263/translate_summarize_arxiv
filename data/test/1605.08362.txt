    "particles continues to challenge experimentalists  @xcite .",
    "likewise , the mechanism responsible for generating small neutrino masses remains as elusive as ever .",
    "it is well  known that , in gauge theories , the detection of neutrinoless double beta decay would signify that neutrinos are of majorana type  @xcite . although experimental confirmation of the majorana hypothesis may come in the not too distant future  @xcite , so far the possibility remains that neutrinos can be dirac particles , despite the fact that the general theoretical expectation is that they are majorana fermions  @xcite as given , for example , in weinberg s dimension five operator  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the most widely studied mechanism to account for the smallness of neutrino masses relative to the charged fermion masses invokes their majorana nature , namely , the conventional high  scale type - i  @xcite or type - ii  @xcite seesaw mechanism .",
    "the same happens in low  scale variants of the seesaw mechanism , see  @xcite for a review .",
    "accommodating the possibility of naturally light dirac neutrinos constitutes a double challenge .",
    "one approach is to supplement the standard electroweak gauge structure by using extra flavor symmetries implying a conserved lepton number , so as to obtain dirac neutrinos , as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "another approach would be to appeal to the existence of extra dimensions , such as in warped scenarios  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may extend the gauge group itself , for example , by using the extended gauge structure because of its special features  @xcite . in this case",
    "one can obtain both the lightness as well as the dirac nature of neutrinos as an outcome  @xcite .",
    "in this letter we focus on the possibility of having naturally light dirac neutrinos with seesaw  induced masses within the framework of the simplest four - dimensional gauge structure , without non - abelian discrete flavor symmetries . to this end",
    "we impose a cyclic flavor ",
    "blind 53 symmetry in a theory with enlarged symmetry breaking sector : two higgs doublets and a singlet , see table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "we find that the resulting model has an accidental spontaneously broken u(1 ) symmetry that leads to the seesaw mechanism as well as the dirac nature of neutrinos .",
    "the smallness of neutrino mass follows from the smallness of a parameter @xmath0 whose absence would increase the symmetry of the electroweak breaking sector , ensuring naturalness in t hooft s sense .",
    "we discuss some phenomenological features of the scheme which follow from the existence of a _ diracon _",
    "namely , the nambu  goldstone boson associated to the spontaneous breaking of the global accidental u(1 ) symmetry in the scalar sector .",
    "the lepton and scalar boson assignments of the model are summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] , where a cyclic 53 symmetry is assumed , so that @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the abelian @xmath5 symmetry is used to have dirac neutrinos in the presence of the additional doublet @xmath6 , forbidding the terms @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we have used two higgs doublets @xmath11 with their conjugates defined as usual , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "the complementary @xmath14 symmetry  @xcite ensures lepton number conservation also at the non - renormalizable level , ruling out possible operators of the type @xmath15 , @xmath16 , etc .",

    "[ fig : numass ] .",
    "as illustrated in the figure , the latter induces nonzero neutrino masses @xmath18 where we denote the three vacuum expectation values as @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath0 is a dimensionless parameter in the scalar potential . for simplicity",
    "we have omitted generation indices .",
    "notice that the smallness of neutrino mass depends not only on the yukawa coupling @xmath22 but is also related to the smallness of @xmath0 , very much like in the type - ii  like seesaw mechanism .    ,",
    "the invariant scalar potential consistent with the global 53 symmetry is given by   @xmath23 where , after acquiring vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) the fields are shifted as follows , @xmath24 so the extremum conditions are , @xmath25 and from these one can derive a `` seesaw  type relation '' amongst the vacuum expectation values given as , @xmath26    notice that @xmath27 is required in order to drive @xmath28 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : numass ] .",
    "moreover one sees that the smallness of @xmath29 is directly related to the smallness of @xmath0 . in other words",
    ", @xmath6 acquires an `` induced '' vev @xmath29 whose smallness is associated to the symmetry enhancement that results from the absence of @xmath0 . in this limit",
    "there would be a second u(1 ) symmetry whose associated nambu - golstone boson is the pseudoscalar @xmath30 , see below .",
    "this means that the `` induced '' vev @xmath31 is always very much suppressed w.r.t .",
    "the standard @xmath32 , responsible for generating the w boson mass . in short the model has a double vev hierarchy @xmath33 the two hierarchies are consistent with the minimization of the potential .",
    "the first is a mild hierarchy , ensuring adequate couplings for the @xmath34 , while the second one is a strong yet `` natural '' hierarchy , because it is related to the enhanced symmetry which would result from the absence of @xmath0 in the lagrangean , even though , in practice , it can not be strictly realized , since we need @xmath35 for a realistic scheme .",
    "+ with the information above one can immediately work our the higgs mass spectrum .",
    "out of the ten scalars , eight from the two  doublet structure , plus two from the extra complex singlet , we are left with seven physical ones after projecting out the three longitudinal degrees of freedom of the massive gauge bosons .",
    "these correspond to three physical cp even scalars , one of which is the 125 gev state discovered at the lhc  @xcite , two physical cp odd scalars , and one electrically charged scalar .",
    "the mass squared matrices for the cp - even and cp - odd sectors , in the weak basis @xmath36 are given below , @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",

    "( [ eq : imag ] ) ( two  dimensional null space ) clearly implies two massless states whose profiles follow just from symmetry reasons .",
    "due to the smallness of @xmath44 , the main components of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath30 are the imaginary parts of the @xmath47 higgs doublet @xmath48 , the singlet @xmath49 and the doublet @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "indeed the first massless cp ",
    "odd eigenvector @xmath45 pointing mainly along @xmath48 corresponds to the unphysical longitudinal mode of the z boson .",
    "the second massless state @xmath46 is mainly singlet and we call it the _ diracon _ , i.e. the physical nambu - golstone boson associated to the accidental u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "it is the analogue of the majoron present in the `` 123 '' type - ii seesaw scheme of  @xcite , and is associated with the type - ii dirac neutrino seesaw mechanism illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : numass ] . on the other hand",
    "the massive pseudoscalar state @xmath30 pointing mainly along the weak isodoublet direction has mass @xmath50 which would vanish in the ( unphysical ) limit @xmath51 .",
    "+ turning now to the charged sector we have , in the basis @xmath52 , the following mass squared matrix , @xmath53 whose eigenstates are the longitudinal w  boson and a physical state @xmath54 of ( squared ) mass @xmath55    notice that , taking into account the smallness of the neutrino mass , i.e. @xmath56 , and using eq .",
