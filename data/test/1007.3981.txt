    "since its discovery by stephenson ( 1986 ) , the remarkable field star bp psc (= sth@xmath3 202 ) has been classified as a classical t tauri star ( ctts ) on the basis of its strong h@xmath3 and forbidden line emission .",
    "the discovery by zuckerman et al .",
    "( 2008 ; hereafter zms08 ) of an orbiting , dusty circumstellar disk and an enormous ( pc - scale ) system of highly collimated outflows ( jets ) would appear , at first glance , to provide strong support for such a ctts classification .",
    "however , as noted by zms08 , it is not at all clear that bp psc is a pre - main sequence ( pre - ms ) star .",
    "first , although its jet system resembles those of cloud - embedded young stellar objects , bp psc is located at high galactic latitude , far from any known star forming cloud . furthermore , unlike the rare ( though increasingly scrutinized ) `` isolated , '' ctts systems within @xmath4 pc ( torres et al .",
    "2008 )  the best - known examples being tw hya ( kastner et al .  1997 ; zuckerman & song 2004 ; and references therein ) and v4046 sgr ( kastner et al .",
    "2008b ; rodriguez et al .",
    "2010 ; and references therein )  bp psc is not associated with any known sparse group of young stars ( zms08 ) .",
    "second , its photospheric li abundance appears to be anomalously weak for a k - type pre - ms star of age @xmath5 myr , and its gravity - sensitive photospheric absorption lines also call into question such a classification ( zms08 ) .",
    "third , the mm - wave molecular spectrum of its circumstellar disk  specifically , its weak cn and hco@xmath6 emission  is atypical of the disks of low - mass , pre - ms stars ( kastner et al .",
    "2008a ) .",
    "in light of the first two considerations , zms08 proposed that bp psc is most likely a first - ascent giant at a distance @xmath7 pc .",
    "they speculated that the bp psc disk / jet system might therefore be the result of a recent , catastrophic interaction in which a low - mass companion star ( or perhaps giant planet ) had been consumed by bp psc .",
    "though somewhat exotic , a similar ( companion engulfment ) scenario may also apply to the first - ascent giant star tyc 4144 329 2 ( melis et al .",
    "2009 ) : the post - ms nature of tyc 4144 329 2 is well - established , yet ( like bp psc ) this star is evidently actively accreting gas from a dusty circumstellar disk .",
    "low - mass , pre - ms stars are highly luminous x - ray sources , with typical ( 0.38.0 kev ) x - ray luminosities @xmath8 \\stackrel{>}{\\sim } 29.5 $ ] and x - ray to bolometric luminosity ratios in the range @xmath9 to @xmath10 ( e.g. , preibisch & feigelson 2005 ; gdel et al .",
    "hence , x - ray observations are diagnostic of stellar youth .",
    "furthermore , in rare cases , tts jet systems may yield shocks energetic enough to produce x - rays , yielding insight into physical conditions within the jets ( e.g. , kastner et al .  2005 ; guedel et al .",
    "2005 , 2007b ) . here ,",
    "we report the results of _ chandra _ x - ray observatory observations of bp psc intended to determine whether bp psc and/or its jet system emit x - rays and , thereby , to better understand the nature of this unusual system .",
    "_ chandra _ observed bp psc in 2009 january , with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) as the detector .",
    "due to spacecraft thermal constraints , the observation was obtained in two pieces of duration 10.15 and 65.4 ks ( obsids 8900 and 10856 , respectively , on 2009 jan.12 and 13 ) , for a total exposure time of 75.5 ks .",
    "data were obtained with acis ccds s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , i2 , and i3 active .",
    "each ccd has a @xmath11 field of view with 0.49@xmath12 pixels , and is sensitive to photons in the energy range 0.58.0 kev ( with some additional sensitivity down to 0.3 kev , for back - illuminated ccd s3 ) .",
    "the telescope was pointed such that bp psc was positioned at the nominal aimpoint of ccd s3 , @xmath13 from the s2-s3 chip boundary .",
    "the merged event data from the two exposures were subject to standard processing , filtering , and calibration ( via _ chandra _ x - ray center ( cxc ) acis pipeline v7.6.1 and caldb v3.5.1 ) .",
    "we ran the cxc ( ciao ) source detection tool ` celldetect ` on the filtered event list , restricted to ccds s2 and s3 ( the other active ccds lie far off the best focal surface ) .",
    "we find 26 sources , including bp psc itself (  3.1 ) , were detected at a significance @xmath14 ( using poisson statistics ) on these two ccds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bppscimage ] , right ) .",
    "four of these s2 and s3 sources lie within @xmath15 of denis near - ir sources ; two of the four ( bp psc itself and an x - ray source detected on ccd s2 ;  3.3 ) are also 2mass sources . based on the @xmath16 x - ray sources that lie within @xmath15 of guide star catalog stars (",
    "not including the bp psc source ) , we estimate the absolute astrometric accuracy of the two - part _ chandra _ pointing to be @xmath17 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : bppscimage ] we display the wide - field h@xmath3 image originally published in zms08 alongside the broad - band ( 0.58.0 kev ) _ chandra_/acis image of the same field surrounding bp psc .",
    "the comparison reveals that _ chandra _ has detected a faint , point - like x - ray source at the position of bp psc .",
    "source detection indicates a background - subtracted count rate of 0.24@xmath180.07 ks@xmath19 for this source , or @xmath20 source photons detected during the @xmath21 ks exposure .",
    "the bp psc x - ray source lies at j2000 coordinates @xmath2223:22:24.72 , @xmath2302:13:41.66 , with a positional uncertainty that is dominated by the estimated astrometric accuracy ( @xmath180.2@xmath12 ) .",
    "given the uncertainties , this x - ray position is precisely coincident with that of the 2mass position of bp psc ( @xmath2223:22:24.70 , @xmath2302:13:41.40 ) as well as with the centroid of submillimeter continuum emission from bp psc ( @xmath2223:22:24.72@xmath180.02 , @xmath2302:13:41.55@xmath180.2 ; zms08 ) .",
    "analysis of photon arrival times ( via a kuiper test against a poisson process ; press et al .",
    "1992 ) yields no evidence that the bp psc source is variable , although we are unable to rule out source variability .",
    "given the small number of photons detected , it is not reasonable to attempt to deduce the characteristic source temperature @xmath24 and line - of - sight absorbing column @xmath25 and , hence , intrinsic source flux @xmath26 via standard x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "however , useful constraints on @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be obtained via the median energy of the detected source photons .",
    "specifically , feigelson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) demonstrated that orion nebula cluster ( onc ) pre - ms star x - ray sources detected by _ chandra_/acis - i display a relatively tight correlation between median x - ray energy and @xmath25 .",
    "getman et al .  ( 2010 ) refined and further generalized the feigelson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) results , demonstrating ( via spectral simulations ) that the relationship between median x - ray energy and @xmath25 should in principle apply to any source that can be modeled in terms of two - temperature optically thin thermal plasma emission suffering intervening absorption , and is applicable over a wide range of intrinsic source luminosity ( i.e. , for @xmath27 from @xmath28 to @xmath29 erg s@xmath30 ) . as the getman et al .",
    "analysis was carried out for sources detected on the front - illuminated acis ccds ( i0-i3 ) , which have lower qe than ccd s3 at low energy ( i.e. , photon energies @xmath31 kev ) , application of the getman et al.methods might result in an underestimate in the value of @xmath25 obtained via the median photon energy of a source on s3 .",
    "this is unlikely to be an important effect for a source as hard as that detected toward bp psc in 2009 , however , especially given the overall degradation in the soft ( @xmath32 kev ) x - ray sensitivity of acis in the decade since _ chandra _ s launch ,    to determine the median detected photon energy for the bp psc source , we applied the ( ae ) software package ( broos et al .",
    "2010 ) to extract and analyze the source photons .",
    "doing so , we find the median background - subtracted photon energy of the bp psc source in the 0.58.0 kev energy band is 3.47@xmath180.33 kev .",
    "this median energy corresponds to an absorbing column @xmath33 = 22.9\\pm0.2 $ ] , based on the `` best model family '' determined from the getman et al .",
    "( 2010 ) statistical spectral analysis method ( we display the ae - extracted x - ray spectral energy distribution of bp psc , overlaid with the getman et al .  `` best model family '' spectral model , in fig .  [ fig : bppsc_spec ] ) . the getman et al .",
    "( 2010 ) method yields an estimated apparent ( measured ) broad - band flux of @xmath34 erg @xmath35 s@xmath19 ( 0.58.0 kev ) , corresponding to an intrinsic flux @xmath36 erg @xmath35 s@xmath19 . the measured and intrinsic hard - band ( 2.08.0 kev ) fluxes are @xmath37 erg @xmath35 s@xmath19 and @xmath38 erg @xmath35 s@xmath19 , respectively . although the statistical error on the broad - band intrinsic flux ( @xmath26 ) is small ( @xmath39% ) , the value of @xmath26 is uncertain by almost a factor of 5 ( and the hard - band intrinsic flux is uncertain by a factor @xmath402 ) , due to systematic uncertainties in determining the generic spectral model that best describes the bp psc source ( see getman et al .  2010 , their fig .  1 )",
    ". however , the foregoing estimates for apparent and intrinsic flux are consistent with those we obtained via simple simulations to match the bp psc source acis - s3 count rate using absorbed thermal plasma models ranging in temperature from @xmath41 to 3.0 kev  a range typical of coronal sources with median photon energies similar to that of bp psc ( feigelson et al .",
    "2005 ; also see  4 )  assuming @xmath42 @xmath35 .    from the preceding results for @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    ", we estimate that the x - ray luminosity of the bp psc source is @xmath43 erg s@xmath19 where @xmath44 is the distance in pc . adopting a bolometric luminosity @xmath45 erg s@xmath19 for the star ( zms08 ) , and allowing for the ( large ) systematic errors in @xmath26 obtained via the getman et al .",
    "( 2010 ) method , we conservatively conclude that @xmath0 lies in the range @xmath1 to @xmath2 , with a best estimate of @xmath46 .      as is apparent from inspection of fig .  1 ,",
    "no diffuse x - ray emission is associated with the jets and bow - shock - like herbig - haro ( hh ) objects emanating from the position of bp psc .",
    "this result is not particularly surprising , considering such emission should be very soft ; indeed , there are few examples of shock - generated x - ray emission among pre - ms jet / hh systems , and the handful that have been detected to date generally display low x - ray luminosities ( e.g. , hh 210 in the onc , with observed @xmath47 erg s@xmath19 ; grosso et al.2006 ) .",
    "we estimated an upper limit on the surface brightness of such diffuse x - ray emission from the bp psc jet system by counting background events within regions centered on the h@xmath3 emission near the tips of the bow shocks seen in optical emission lines .",
    "the resulting limit is @xmath48 erg @xmath35 s@xmath19 arcsec@xmath49 .",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit on emergent x - ray luminosity of @xmath50 erg s@xmath19 for any compact ( @xmath15 ) x - ray - emitting knots in the bp psc jet system .      if bp psc is a nearby ( @xmath51 pc ) , `` isolated '' classical t tauri star akin to tw hya or v4046 sgr ( e.g. , kastner et al .",
    "2008b and references therein ) , then it could be a member of a sparse group of young ( age @xmath52 myr ) stars whose members are quite x - ray luminous relative to the field star population ( zuckerman & song 2004 ; torres et al .",
    "2008 ; and references therein ) .",
    "if so , there would be a small chance that the @xmath53 square degree field imaged by _",
    "[ fig : bppscimage ] ) contains one or more low - mass members of this putative `` bp psc association . '' such young stars , being close to earth , should be sufficiently luminous in x - rays as to be readily detectable in our @xmath21 ks _ chandra _ exposure and should be bright near - ir sources ( bp psc itself , though occulted by its disk and not directly detected in the near - ir , has @xmath54 )",
    ".    as already noted , however , only one of the roughly dozen x - ray sources detected on ccd s3  bp psc itself  is also a 2mass source .",
    "an additional dozen , relatively bright ( @xmath55 count ) x - ray sources are detected on s2 ( the ccd abutting s3 ) , although some of these sources suffer from poor image quality due to a combination of large off - axis angle and non - optimal detector geometry with respect to the focal surface of the _ chandra _ mirror assembly .",
    "of these s2 sources only one , at @xmath2223:22:41.4 , @xmath56=-02:21:23 ( j2000 )  the bright x - ray source at the extreme southeast corner of the image in the righthand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bppscimage ]  can be readily associated with a bright ( @xmath57 ) star ( usno - b1 08760839011 ) .",
    "given its usno and 2mass catalog magnitudes ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ) this x - ray - bright object is indeed a candidate young ( age @xmath16 myr ) , late - type ( k3 - 4 ) star ; but as such it would lie at a distance @xmath63 pc .",
    "furthermore , its proper motion ( @xmath64 = [ 48 , 28 ] mas yr@xmath19 ; usno - b1 ) is signicantly different from that measured for bp psc ( [ 44.4 , @xmath6526.3 ] mas yr@xmath19 ; tycho-2 ) .",
    "hence usno - b1 08760839011 is not associated with bp psc , whether or not bp psc is a young star at @xmath51 pc .",
    "our _ chandra _ observation of bp psc has yielded a detection of a faint x - ray point source that is coincident with the bright optical / near - ir and submillimeter emission associated with this unusual field star .",
    "the nature of this x - ray emission source is difficult to ascertain , given the small number of photons detected .",
    "however , the median energy ( @xmath66 kev ) and , hence , the resulting inferred absorbing column density ( @xmath67 @xmath35 ) appear typical of pre - ms star x - ray sources detected within dusty circumstellar disks that are viewed nearly edge - on ( kastner et al .  2005 ) . the large value we infer for @xmath25 , which corresponds to a @xmath68 band extinction of @xmath4 magnitudes ( vuong et al .",
    "2003 ) , is consistent with the fact that the photosphere of bp psc is thus far only detected indirectly  via scattering off circumstellar dust  in the visible and near - ir ( zms08 ) .",
    "given that the median detected photon energy is @xmath66 kev , it would appear that the x - rays detected from bp psc are too hard to be attributed to internal shocks associated with its jet - launching regions  in contrast to cases in which soft ( @xmath32 kev ) x - rays have been detected at the bases of optical jets associated with certain classical t tauri stars ( kastner et al .  2005 ; guedel et al .",
    "2005 , 2007b ) . indeed ,",
    "the bp psc x - ray source spectral energy distribution ( fig  [ fig : bppsc_spec ] ) reveals no evidence for such a soft x - ray `` excess . '' instead , the x - ray photons we have detected would appear to be associated with magnetic reconnection activity near the star .",
    "such magnetic activity , in turn , could be due either to a stellar corona or to star - disk interactions . in either case",
    " given that the stellar photosphere is evidently obscured from direct view , even at near - ir wavelengths ( zms08 )  it would appear that the x - ray source at bp psc likely represents the first direct detection of radiation from within a few stellar radii of bp psc itself , and that the x - ray - based value of @xmath25 we have obtained is therefore the only presently available measurement of the extinction toward the star ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the values of x - ray luminosity and @xmath0 (  3.1 ) inferred from the _ chandra _ detection would appear to place bp psc at the extreme low end of the ( well - determined ) x - ray luminosity distributions of t tauri stars in the onc ( preibisch & feigelson 2005 ) and in taurus ( guedel et al .",
    "specifically , the value of @xmath70 we estimate for bp psc , @xmath71 erg s@xmath19 , places bp psc well below the median value of @xmath70 for @xmath72 onc stars in the 320 myr age range ( the relevant range if bp psc is pre - main sequence ; zms08 ) .",
    "only @xmath73% of onc stars display @xmath74 erg s@xmath19 ( preibisch & feigelson 2005 ) .",
    "in contrast , the inferred range of @xmath0 , @xmath1 to @xmath2 , would place bp psc well within the ( rather broad ) @xmath0 distribution of the class of rapidly rotating ( fk com - like ) g giants .",
    "the dozen or so members of this class range from @xmath75 to @xmath76 , with a median of @xmath77 ( gondoin 2005 ) .",
    "hence , the _ chandra _ identification of a weak x - ray source at the position of bp psc appears to throw some weight behind a post - main sequence classification for this star  and supports a model in which the detected x - rays most likely arise from coronal activity , as a consequence of its rapid rotation rate ( see zms08 ) .",
    "the large angular momentum required to sustain such rapid rotation , in turn , would seem to be consistent with the notion that bp psc has recently consumed a companion star ( as proposed by zms08 ) , and is therefore an fk com - type star `` in the making '' ( as speculated by kastner et al .",
    "we have used the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory to detect a weak x - ray point source that is coincident with the centroids of optical / ir and submillimeter continuum emission from the disk - enshrouded , jet - driving field star bp psc .",
    "as the star s photosphere is obscured throughout the visible and near - infrared , the _ chandra _ x - ray source appears to represent the first detection of bp psc itself .",
    "chandra _ x - ray image yields no detection of the bp psc jet system , nor evidence that bp psc is associated with a young stellar group or cluster .    from the median energy of",
    "the detected bp psc source photons ( @xmath66 kev ) , we infer an absorbing column @xmath33 = 22.9\\pm0.2 $ ] and an x - ray luminosity @xmath78 erg s@xmath19 ) , with @xmath0 in the range @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "the rather large median x - ray energy indicates that the x - rays most likely originate with magnetic activity , as opposed to shocks near the star , and hence are produced either in a stellar corona or in star - disk magnetospheric interaction regions .",
    "the inferred values of @xmath70 and @xmath79 are 12 orders of magnitude smaller than those typical of low - mass , pre - main sequence stars , but are well within the range observed for rapidly - rotating ( fk com - type ) g giant stars .",
    "hence , the _ chandra _ results favor an exotic model wherein the disk / jet system of bp psc is the result of its very recently engulfing a companion star or giant planet , as the primary star ascended the giant branch .",
