    "once the system is in its steady state , a low - frequency wavepacket perturbation is generated in the downstream super - sonic region by means of an extra coherent laser pulse with a spatio - temporal shape of the form @xmath138 the probe wave vector ( @xmath139 ) and frequency ( @xmath140 ) are chosen to be resonant with the bogoliubov branch labeled as @xmath119 in the ( c ) panels .",
    "the probe beam is centered at @xmath117 ; its waist @xmath141 determines the spatial size of the generated wavepacket ( and its inverse width in @xmath135-space ) .",
    "the temporal duration @xmath142 has to be long enough not to excite the upper polariton branch nor the negative - norm bogoliubov branch .",
    "its amplitude @xmath143 is chosen weak enough to remain within the validity domain of a linearized description of excitations .    the generated wavepacket shown in figs .",

    "a series of snapshots of this evolution are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : nobh_snap ] and [ fig : bh_snap ] .",
    "the difference between the behaviors of the weak and of a large surface gravity cases is apparent : in the former case , only two wavepackets visibly emerge from the horizon at long times , located on the @xmath144 and @xmath145 bogoliubov branches . on the other hand , in the latter case , an extra wavepacket appears on the @xmath146 branch .",
    "remarkably , the bogoliubov norm of this wavepacket is negative , which signals the occurrence of hawking conversion processes .",
    "the identification of the different wavepackets in terms of their bogoliubov branch is confirmed by the numerical measurement of their group velocity and of their wavevector .    of course , the physical reason why we did not observe a @xmath146 wavepacket in fig .  [ fig : nobh_snap ] is that the low value of the surface gravity strongly suppresses the amplitude of the hawking process .",
    "as it was expected on general grounds  @xcite and then explicitly verified  @xcite , the hawking scattering amplitude for a bogoliubov wavepacket of given carrier frequency @xmath147 scales down exponentially with the surface gravity according to the boltzmann factor @xmath148 . on the other hand , excitation of the @xmath146 branch",
    "would be totally forbidden if the flow was everywhere sub - sonic and no horizon was present : in this case , in fact , energy could not be conserved in the hawking scattering process .",
    "this quantity directly reflects in the intensity correlations of a near - field image of the emitted light from the microcavity . the upper ( a ) panel refers to the case of a purely ballistic flow considered in figs .",
    "[ fig : nobh_scheme ] and [ fig : nobh_snap ] .",

    "the colored dashed lines in ( b ) indicate the different hawking features as discussed in the text.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the process studied in the previous section provides a solid evidence of the classical counterpart of the hawking effect , namely the possibility of inter - converting positive and negative norm waves at the horizon .",
    "now we shall proceed with the study of the hawking effect _",
    "stricto sensu _ ,",
    "i.e. the emission of radiation by the horizon via the inter - conversion of zero - point quantum fluctuations into observable radiation .    to this purpose",
    ", one has to fully include in the model the quantum fluctuations of the fields around the mean - field value predicted by the gross - pitaevskii equation . in this work ,",
    "we adopt the truncated wigner approach described in sec .",
    "[ sec : montecarlo ] , where expectation values of quantum operators are calculated as classical averages over a suitably chosen stochastic partial differential equation .",
    "inspired from previous theoretical  @xcite and numerical  @xcite work , we shall consider the spatial correlation function of the quantum fluctuations of the fluid density : the smoking gun of hawking radiation consist of a negative long - range correlation signal between points located on opposite sides of the horizon .",
    "numerical plots of the normalized density - density correlation function @xmath149 are shown in the two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] for the two cases of a weak and strong surface gravity @xmath150 , respectively .",
    "while in the upper panel , fig .",
    "[ fig : g2](a ) ( weak surface gravity , @xmath151 mev ) there is no clear feature emerging over noise , the lower panel , fig .",
    "[ fig : g2](b ) ( strong surface gravity , @xmath152 mev ) shows several features that can be interpreted as a direct consequence of the analog hawking radiation  @xcite : the two bogoliubov excitations forming the hawking pair are simultaneously emitted from the horizon . at later times ,",
    "the temporal correlation between the emission time of the hawking partners reflects into a long - distance correlation in the density fluctuations due to each member of the pair .",
    "while in the atomic case this correlation extends at long times to indefinitely large distances from the horizon , the finite decay rate of bogoliubov excitations in polariton fluids predicted in ( [ eq : sonic ] ) restricts the correlation signal to a finite region of size @xmath153 around the horizon , @xmath154 being the group velocity of the bogoliubov branch under consideration .",
    "away from this region around the horizon , the hawking phonons have decayed and the corresponding density fluctuations have disappeared .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .  [ fig : g2](b ) indicate the location at which one would expect the maximal density correlations due to the quantum vacuum emission process into the @xmath155 ( white ) , the @xmath156 ( purple ) , the @xmath157 ( yellow ) pair of modes .",
    "the first process is the traditional hawking emission process where the two quanta are emitted into opposite directions from the horizon .",
    "the main properties of the density correlation pattern due to this process is well captured by the non - dispersive quantum field theory on curved space - time as proposed in ref .  .",
    "for @xmath158 and @xmath159 , the correlation is peaked along the half - line @xmath160 here , @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the flow speed and speed of sound in the upstream and downstream regions , so that @xmath163 and @xmath164 are the group velocity of the @xmath146 and @xmath144 modes in the low-@xmath135 , sonic region .",
    "while in the atomic bec case of ref .",
    "their value did not depend on space in the asymptotic regions away from the horizon , the driven - dissipative nature of polaritons is responsible for the spatial dependence of the flow @xmath82 and sound @xmath165 speeds that is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : bh_scheme](b ) , mostly in the downstream region .",
    "however , as the space dependence remains moderate within the regions of thickness @xmath166 and @xmath167 on either side of the horizon where correlations are significant , no appreciable curvature of the hawking tongues is visible in fig .  [",
    "fig : g2](b ) .    the orientation of the purple and yellow dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2](b ) is analogously obtained from the group velocity of the corresponding modes , namely @xmath168 and @xmath169    the excellent agreement of the geometrical location of the numerically observed features with the analytical predictions ( [ eq : ud2][eq : d1d2 ] ) confirms our interpretation . remarkably  , the peak value of the @xmath155 hawking correlation signal is on the order of @xmath170 , which is not too far from the analytical prediction of ref .  .",
    "as the surface gravity is here comparable to the interaction energy @xmath171 , the quantitative discrepancy can be easily traced back to the breakdown of the hydrodynamical approximation underlying the analytical model  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the continuous - wave nature of the proposed experimental setting , the quantitatively low value signal to be observed can be overcome by a sufficiently long integration time .",
    "while agreement with the atomic case is good also for the @xmath156 feature , the @xmath157 one has a different sign .",
    "a possible explanation of this behavior can be traced back to the non - universality of the @xmath172 back - scattering effect that is responsible for the conversion at the horizon of the standard @xmath155 hawking correlation into the @xmath157 one .    before concluding , it is important to note that throughout the whole discussion , we have implicitly assumed that the @xmath173 correlation function is assumed to be measured at the same time : a rough estimate of the required temporal resolution of the detector is given by @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the speed of sound in the polariton gas ( on the order of @xmath176m / ps from figs .",
    "[ fig : bh_scheme ] ) and @xmath177 is the spatial width of the correlation signal . using the value @xmath178 m taken from fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] , one can estimate the needed temporal resolution to be on the order of @xmath179ps , which is within the state - of - the - art of optical technology .",
    "in this article we have presented a comprehensive study of classical and quantum hydrodynamic properties of acoustic black holes in superfluids of exciton - polaritons in semiconductor microcavities . inspired from on - going experimental research ,",
    "we have identified and characterized one - dimensional polariton wire devices as model systems , where the polaritons injected by a single monochromatic laser beam with a suitable spot profile generate a flow configuration showing an acoustic black hole horizon .",
    "inserting a repulsive potential defect provides a dramatic enhancement of the analog surface gravity at the horizon . even if our calculations have been performed for the specific case of a semiconductor microcavity in the strong - coupling regime , all conclusions straightforwardly extend to a generic planar cavity filled by a nonlinear optical medium , as originally suggested in ref .  , or photonic crystal polariton states with engineered mode dispersion  @xcite .    in analogy with previous works on acoustic black holes in atomic condensates and classical hydrodynamics of surface waves ,",
    "two experiments have been proposed and numerically simulated to assess the efficiency of hawking wave - conversion processes at the horizon . when a coherent wavepacket of bogoliubov phonons is incident on the horizon , the hawking effect is visible as the production of an extra emerging wavepacket on the negative - norm branch .",
    "this is the classical evidence for the hawking process taking place at the horizon . on the other hand , the usual hawking",
    "radiation is a purely quantum effect consisting of the conversion of zero - point fluctuations into a stream of observable phonons at the horizon : the correlation between the emission times of a phonon and its hawking partner is visible as a long - distance correlation between the density fluctuations on either side of the horizon .",
    "the density correlations provide the clearest experimental signature of hawking radiation in superfluids : in the present polariton case , in - cavity density correlations directly transfer into the secondary emission from the cavity photon , and can be observed as analogous correlations in the intensity fluctuations of the near - field emission .",
    "as soon as a sufficient signal over noise ratio is achieved , an experiment along the proposed lines will hopefully provide a clear evidence of a fundamental effect of quantum field theory that so far has eluded all experimental observation , overcoming the barrier to direct observation imposed by the negligibly small hawking temperature of astrophysical black - holes .",
