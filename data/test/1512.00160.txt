    "the study of quantum quench , the evolution following a sudden or slow change of the coupling constants of the system hamiltonian , has attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "dynamics in quench processes can serve as a powerful tool in revealing rich correlations and inducing interesting non - equilibrium states  @xcite . due to the highly controllable parameters ,",
    "ultracold atomic gases have become an ideal platform for the investigation of dynamical processes  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , quench dynamics have been used to study various interesting non - equilibrium properties of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec )  @xcite , and quenching has proved pivotal in probing pairing correlations in fermi condensates  @xcite . theoretically , quench dynamics of both bec and fermi superfluid",

    "many - body correlations depend sensitively on the inter - atomic interaction , a frequent theme in these studies is investigating the system dynamics following a sudden change of inter - atomic interaction strength .",
    "this is possible by switching the external magnetic field via a feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "a potential problem in these quench processes is the large atom losses close to the feshbach resonance .",
    "this is less of a problem for fermi gases , where losses through three - body recombination are suppressed near resonance  @xcite . for bose gases",
    ", the three - body loss rate typically grows faster with an increasing scattering length than the two - body scattering rate  @xcite .",
    "as the two - body scattering is essential for equilibration , it has been difficult to realize a strongly interacting bec in equilibrium close to the feshbach resonance .",
    "however , as a recent jila experiment demonstrates  @xcite , close to unitarity , a steady - state bec with strong interactions can be prepared via a quench process , where saturation of the system properties have been observed before the atoms are lost due to three - body recombination .",
    "apparently , the three - body loss rate is lower than the two - body scattering rate when the system is quenched close to unitarity .",
    "this is not unexpected , as at unitarity , the scattering length diverges and the scaling relations of losses with respect to the scattering length are no longer applicable  @xcite .",
    "this allows the gas to evolve into a stead - state bec .",
    "theoretically , the quench process and the final steady - state properties can be qualitatively captured by dynamic mean field approaches  @xcite .    motivated by these exciting experimental and theoretical developments , we study the quench dynamics of a bec under the synthetic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) that has recently been realized experimentally at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist )  @xcite .",

    ", we adopt a self - consistent bogoliubov approach , which is equivalent to applying the time - dependent bogoliubov - de - gennes equations .",
    "we investigate the dynamics of the condensate fraction as well as the momentum distribution of the bose gas after a sudden change of system parameters such as the interaction strength or the laser parameters generating the soc .",
    "typically , the system evolves into a steady state in the long - time limit , which features a stationary condensate fraction and an oscillating momentum distribution .",
    "the condensate fraction of the steady state depends on the quench parameters and remains finite .",
    "this is consistent with a recent work on the quench dynamics of a bec in the absence of soc  @xcite .",
    "although our approach differs from the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite , one thing in common is that the variation of the condensate mean field in time is taken into account .",
    "we also find that while sudden changes of su(2)-invariant interaction strengths can lead to large condensate depletions , a sudden change of the inter - species interaction strength typically gives rise to a much smaller condensate depletion .",
    "therefore , the intra - species interactions have great impact on the steady - state condensate fraction in these system .",
    "furthermore , we show that if the soc strength is changed , which is feasible by controlling the laser strength , the condensate fraction would remain large in the dynamical process .",
    "surprisingly , the depletion of the condensate remains small even if the single - particle dispersion undergoes a qualitative change after the quench .",
    "finally , we find that the time average of the oscillatory momentum distribution in the long - time limit can be described by a generalized gibbs ensemble with two branches of momentum - dependent gibbs temperatures , which correspond to the two helicity branches in the bogoliubov excitation spectrum .",

    "we note that this observation is consistent with a previous calculation on the quench dynamics of bec in the absence of soc  @xcite .",

    "typically , the depletion of condensate is much smaller than in the su(2 ) invariant case .",
    "this demonstrates the critical role of intra - species interaction in generating excitations during the quench process .",
    "finally , we note that quench processes with @xmath12 lead to larger condensate depletions under a sudden change of inter - species interaction .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that spin mixing is more pronounced in the pre - quench condensate with @xmath12 .",

    ", the steady - state condensate condenses at a different state from the equilibrium ground state under post - quench parameters .",
    "a similar quasi - condensation has been shown to exist in post - quench steady states of one dimensional systems  @xcite . finally , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , when the critical rabi frequency @xmath84 is crossed , the modification of the single - particle dispersion leads to a larger change in the steady - state condensate fraction .",
    "this is consistent with our expectation , as when both the initial and the final rabi frequency are on the same side of @xmath85 , the single - particle dispersion around the condensation point in momentum space only undergoes minimal change .     following an soc parameter switch from @xmath81 to @xmath82 .",

    "to further understand the steady state , we evoke the formalism of the generalized gibbs ensemble to characterize the distribution of quasi - particle excitations above the steady - state condensate .",
    "it has been pointed out that in isolated integral systems , the steady state can be described by the generalized gibbs ensemble  @xcite . while in our system the quasi - particle excitations are not isolated due to the existence of a condensate reservoir , we follow the argument first presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , that in the long - time limit , the quasi - particle excitations are approximately constants of motion .",
