    "0.25 cm a good number of the isotopes of nuclei heavier than iron are produced by the rapid neutron - capture process ( the so - called r - process ) nucleosynthesis , the site of which is not known .",
    "r - process nucleosynthesis requires interaction of a large number of neutrons during a relatively short duration , suggesting that its sites are likely to be associated with explosive phenomena .",
    "in fact , burbidge _ et al _ originally suggested that the neutrino - rich ejecta outside the collapsed core in a supernova could be an r - process site @xcite .",
    "recent observations of metal - poor stars and meteoric data suggest that r - process nuclei may be produced at multiple sites @xcite .",
    "possible sites for the r - process nucleosynthesis include the neutrino - driven wind in a core - collapse supernova @xcite or binary neutron - star systems @xcite .",
    "neutrino interactions play a very crucial role both in the dynamics of core - collapse supernovae and in the r - process nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "isotopic yields of r - process nucleosynthesis are determined by the neutron - to - proton ratio , n / p @xcite .",
    "there are two key issues in understanding how this ratio changes : i ) neutrinos and antineutrinos streaming out of the core interact both with nucleons and the seed nuclei . since these interactions determine the n / p ratio , it is crucial to understand neutrino - nucleon cross sections in considerable detail .",
    "ii ) before these neutrinos reach the r - process region they may undergo matter - enhanced neutrino oscillations as well as coherently scatter over other neutrinos .",
    "many - body behavior of this neutrino gas is not understood , but may have significant impact on the r - process nucleosynthesis . here",
    "i briefly discuss our recent work addressing these two issues .",
    "0.25 cm the covariant matrix element for the reaction @xmath0 is @xmath1 u_{p}\\right\\ }   \\left\\ { \\overline{\\nu } _ { \\nu } \\gamma^{\\alpha } ( 1   -\\gamma _ { 5})\\nu _ { e}\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the fermi weak coupling constant and @xmath3 is the cabibbo angle .",
    "the vector @xmath4 , the axial - vector @xmath5 , the tensor @xmath6 ( or weak magnetism ) , the induced tensor @xmath7 , the induced scalar @xmath8 and the induced pseudo - scalar @xmath9 form factors are included in this matrix element .",
    "the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis states that @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the difference in the anomalous magnetic moments of the nucleons , and @xmath12 is the mass of the nucleon .",
    "data for neutrino - nucleon scattering at energies relevant to astrophysics are very scarce .",
    "one possibility to measure the cross section for this process is to utilize proposed beta - beam facilities .",
    "beta - beams are pure @xmath13 or @xmath14 beams produced by allowing radioactive ions circulating in a storage ring to decay @xcite .",
    "the low - energy option @xcite , where one can vary the lorentz boost factor @xmath15 of the stored ions between 7 and 14 , is especially suitable to measure the energy dependence of the cross section in the energy range up to 100 mev .",
    "the potential of low - energy beta beams for neutrino - nucleus scattering @xcite , for electroweak tests of the standard model @xcite , and for core - collapse supernova physics @xcite has been previously discussed .",
    "we recently investigated the possibility of measuring antineutrino scattering off protons in a water cerenkov detector using low - energy beta beams @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the sensitivity using both the total number of events and the angular distribution of the positrons emitted .",
    "figure 1 shows the expected number of events at the detector over a period of one year as a function of the lorentz boost factor with ( solid - line ) and without ( dashed - line ) the weak magnetism term .",
    "one observes that at the highest @xmath15 value the weak magnetism term suppresses the total number of events by as much as 17 % .",
    "we found that the weak magnetism form factor may be determined with better than several percent accuracy using the angular distribution information of the positrons emitted .",
    "in addition to providing a test of the cvc hypothesis , measurement of weak magnetism terms in neutrino - nucleon interactions are of direct interest to astrophysics as these terms may play an important role in the dynamic of core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "4.3 cm   events in a water cerenkov detector over one year with ( solid - line ) and without ( dashed - line ) the weak magnetism term ( from ref .",
    "0.25 cm neutrino oscillations in a core - collapse supernova differ from the matter - enhanced neutrino oscillations in the sun as in the former there are additional effects coming from both neutrino - neutrino scattering @xcite and antineutrino flavor transformations @xcite .",
    "the standard msw term describing the interaction of neutrinos with the background electrons is a one - body term for neutrinos .",
    "exact solutions of the full neutrino many - body problem with the one - body msw term and the two - body neutrino - neutrino forward scattering term have not yet been found .",
    "for two neutrino flavors , i.e. the electron neutrino , @xmath13 , and a combination of muon and tau neutrinos , called @xmath16 , the one - body term in the neutrino many - body hamiltonian is @xcite @xmath17 - \\sqrt{2 } g_f   \\int d^3p n_e j_0(p ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the net electron density ; @xmath19 is the vacuum mixing angle , and @xmath20 . in writing eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) we introduced the operators @xmath21 where we used the creation and annihilation operators for @xmath13 and @xmath16 .",
    "the operators in eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) satisfy the commutation relations @xmath22 = 2 \\delta^3(p - q)j_0(p ) , \\ \\ \\ [ j_0(p),j_\\pm(q ) ] = \\pm \\delta^3(p - q)j_\\pm(p).\\ ] ] these operators describe @xmath23 mutually commuting su(2 ) algebras , where @xmath23 is the number of allowed values of neutrino momenta .",
    "in fact , the evolution operator for the standard msw problem of neutrinos , mixing with each other and interacting with background electrons , can be written down exactly using this algebraic ansatz .",
    "in addition , there is a two - body term in the hamiltonian describing neutrino - neutrino forward scattering : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the quantization volume and @xmath26 is the angle between neutrino three - momenta p and q.    one can calculate the path integral for the many - body problem using the su(2 ) coherent states @xmath27 path integral representation of the matrix element of the evolution operator calculated with @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 \\ ,",
    "e^{is[z , z^*]},\\ ] ] where the action functional is @xmath30= \\int_{t_i}^{t_f}dt \\langle z'(t_f ) |",
    "i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}-h_\\nu - h_{\\nu\\nu } | z(t_i )   \\rangle -i \\log \\langle z'(t_f)|z(t_f ) \\rangle.\\ ] ]    the path integral given in eq .",
    "( [ a4 ] ) , to date , has not been evaluated exactly .",
    "however , it is possible to evaluate it using the stationary path approximation and calculate the stationary path @xmath31 that minimizes the action functional @xcite . by interpreting this stationary path as the ratio of the one - body neutrino wavefunctions , i.e. @xmath32 and imposing the normalization condition @xmath33 one can relate results obtained using stationary path approximation to the commonly utilized schrodinger - type equation such as the one used in refs .",
    "@xcite . numerical solutions of this approximate schrodinger - type nonlinear equation are still not easy to obtain as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a description of neutrino physics with two flavors is exact only when the third mixing angle , @xmath34 , is zero @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to incorporate both the antineutrinos ( which are crucial to nucleosynthesis in core - collapse supernovae ) and the presence of three flavors in this algebraic formalism @xcite .",
    "0.25 cm it should be emphasized that neutrino oscillations significantly impact r - process nucleosynthesis only if different flavors initially have well - pronounced energy differences .",
    "the precise energy hierarchy of the neutrinos depends on the microphysics of their production @xcite .",
    "this microphysics is dominated by the inelastic neutrino - nucleon interactions .    in a core - collapse supernova ,",
    "as the alpha particle mass fraction increases , free nucleons get bound in alphas and , because of the large binding energy of the alpha particle , cease interacting with neutrinos .",
    "( this is called `` alpha effect '' @xcite ) .",
    "electron neutrinos radiated from the proto - neutron stars are typically too energetic to prevent the alpha effect ( and the following demise of r - process nucleosynthesis ) in most cases .",
    "one way to get around this issue is to convert active electron neutrinos into sterile ones @xcite .",
    "inclusion of sterile neutrinos in the algebraic approach described above will be discussed elsewhere .    finally , it should be pointed out that the neutrino gas is not necessarily present in all cases .",
    "if , instead of a proto - neutron star , a black - hole is formed , then the neutrino flux emission may be truncated @xcite .",
    "note that it may be possible to find signatures of such a neutrino - flux truncation in the fossil record of the isotopes produced in the r - process nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
