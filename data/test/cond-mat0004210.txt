    "the investigation of effects of weak localization in low  dimensional electronic systems still preserves its popularity today , since experimental studies of these systems give occasionally surprising results like metal  insulator phase transitions in the two  dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas at zero magnetic field@xcite and unusual behavior of dephasing time in quasi one  dimensional metallic wires@xcite at low temperatures .",
    "impurity effects in one  dimensional ( 1d ) disordered systems have been studied accurately due to the existence of methods which give exact results for the cases of both weak and strong disorder.@xcite also perturbative approaches give good results for three  dimensional ( 3d ) weakly disordered systems .",
    "weak localization corrections to the kinetic coefficients of 2d disordered systems are logarithmically divergent corrections and it is hard to sum perturbatively the leading divergent contributions .",
    "the dimension two is the marginal dimension for the localization problem and a small external perturbation can change the character of localization in these systems .    according to the scaling theory of abrahams _ et .",
    "al._@xcite all states of 1d and 2d electronic gases moving in the field of randomly distributed impurities are completely localized irrespective of the degree of randomness , and in 3d the anderson metal  insulator phase transition occurs with increasing impurity concentration .",
    "notice that the result of the scaling theory for 1d disordered systems is in agreement with exact results.@xcite the scaling theory , and also the diagrammatic approach to the problem for 2d weakly disordered systems has revealed logarithmic quantum corrections to the conductivity,@xcite which tend towards localization .",
    "the logarithmic correction to the conductivity found in [ ] can be expressed as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the drude conductivity , @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 being the elastic and inelastic scattering times , respectively ; @xmath5 is the linear size of a 2d system and @xmath6 is the external frequency .",
    "notice that weak disorder gives no singular contribution to the density of states ( dos ) @xmath7 of electron gas models when the condition @xmath8 or @xmath9 is satisfied ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the fermi momentum and the fermi energy ; @xmath12 is the mean free path ) .",
    "according to the einstein relation @xmath13 the quantum correction eq.([eq:2d_log_correction ] ) to @xmath14 is due to changes in the diffusion coefficient@xcite @xmath15 .",
    "even short  range and weak correlations in weakly disordered metals have been shown@xcite to result in nontrivial quantum corrections to the dos of low  dimensional conductors near the fermi level .",
    "electron interactions in disordered systems also give rise to quantum corrections to the conductivity , which tend to localize the electronic states .",
    "further , the dos of strongly doped semiconductors in the presence of long range coulomb interaction vanishes at the fermi surface,@xcite which is commonly referred to as coulomb gap .",
    "disordered metals in most of the papers on localization problems are modeled as a free electron gas moving in the random field of impurities .",
    "however , doped crystals with low concentrations of impurities usually preserve their periodical structures and the impurity atoms in most cases substitute the host atoms of the lattice .",
    "substitutional impurities appear to have strong influence on the physical properties of low  dimensional lattices near the commensurate values of the electron wave length @xmath16 with the lattice constant @xmath17 [ ] .",
    "in this paper we shall study the effects of substitutional impurities with small concentration on the density of states and the conductivity of a 2d square lattice .",
    "the effects of commensurability on the dos for the 3d simple cubic lattice will also be considered for the sake of completeness .",
    "bragg reflections of the electronic wave on the brillouin zone boundary in the process of impurity scattering become essential as the middle of the band is approached .",
    "this process introduces a new relaxation time for umklapp scattering to the problem , which increases for a deviation from half  filling due to the distortion of the commensurability condition for the bragg reflection .",
    "the lattices under consideration have square structure for 2d and simple cubic structure for 3d crystals .",
    "our calculations show that umklapp scattering strongly changes the energy dependence of the dos close to half  filling , causing it to decrease .",
    "for the 2d square lattice the dos of the pure system has a logarithmic van hove singularity at the middle of the band .",
    "this peak is shown to be preserved for the lattice with substitutional impurities .",
    "however its energy dependence is changed strongly , and the peak becomes narrower.@xcite for the 3d lattice , the van hove singularities lie far from the center of the band and umklapp scattering forms a shallow dip on the fermi surface , the depth of which increases with the impurity concentration .",
    "periodicity causes the appearance of a new class of diagrams which give a contribution to the conductivity @xmath18 .",
    "these corrections to the conductivity can be separated into two classes : corrections due to the diffusion coefficient and due to the dos .",
    "although quantum corrections to the diffusion coefficient slightly increase @xmath18 , the total corrections sum up to a decrease of @xmath18 due to dos corrections in the vicinity of half  filling .",
    "the paper is structured in the following form . in sec.[sec : description ] the method is described , where new diffuson and cooperon blocks due to umklapp scattering are introduced and calculated .",
    "sec.[sec : dos ] is devoted to the calculation of corrections to the dos near half  filling for 2d and 3d lattices . in sec.[sec : conductivity ] , the calculation of the conductivity of the 2d square lattice with substitutional impurities is presented . in sec.[sec : conclusion ] , a conclusion and a discussion of the results are given .",

    "the cooperon block turns out to have a diffusion pole also for large momentum transfer when the total momenta of the particles are @xmath62 with @xmath60 and when the total energy is small . in this case",
    "each act of scattering on an impurities involves a large momentum transfer close to @xmath59 .",
    "this process of course takes place mainly around half  filling when @xmath63 , and it consists of simultaneous bragg reflection of the electron in the process of scattering on the impurity , with relaxation time @xmath64 .",
    "this scattering process will be further referred to as @xmath65scattering .",
    "two different scattering processes and corresponding relaxation times can be separated : normal scattering with @xmath66 ( see fig.[fig : vertices]a ) , when the scattering on an impurity maintains the electron s momentum inside the first brillouin zone after scattering and @xmath65scattering , with a relaxation time @xmath64 ( fig.[fig : vertices]b ) . here ,",

    "the same situation occurs for the @xmath65diffusion block @xmath74 ( fig.[fig : ladder_diagrams ] ) with a large difference ( @xmath75 ) of electron and hole momenta , with @xmath76 .",
    "the comparison of the normal diffuson block @xmath77 with the @xmath65diffuson @xmath78 reveals again strong differences between these two processes . in the process of propagation in the @xmath79diffusion channel ,",

    "the dos of 2d and 3d simple ( cubic ) crystals with substitutional impurities turns out to have a quantum correction near the middle of the band even for noninteracting electrons .",
    "effects of commensurability on the dos and on the kinetics of 1d disordered crystals near the middle of the band have been calculated by many authors.@xcite dyson first pointed out@xcite that the dos of phonons of a 1d disordered chain has a singularity as @xmath120 near the middle of the band .",
    "notice that the singular increasing of the dos in a 1d system at half  filling is not connected with the van hove singularity , since the latter is located at the band edge for the 1d system .",
    "instead it is mediated by the interference of impurity scattering and bragg reflections at half  filling .",
    "later an analogous singularity has been found in the electronic dos of many 1d models.@xcite since the 1d scattering problem is characterized by forward and backward scattering processes , 1d models with off  diagonal disorder display a singularity at the center of the band only if the forward scattering amplitude turns to zero .",
    "small forward scattering with bragg reflection seems to enhance localization and as a result the dos divergence in the band center is blurred .",
    "effects of substitutional impurities on the dos of 2d ( square , honeycomb and triangular ) and 3d ( simple cubic ) lattices have been studied computationally@xcite for cases with diagonal and off  diagonal disorder .",
    "the existence of a van hove singularity in the dos of a two sublattice model for @xmath121 has been shown in [ @xmath122 on the basis of an @xmath123 expansion in disordered systems with @xmath124 orbitals per site for energies approaching the band center . in all cases diagonal disorder has been shown to suppress the van hove singularity , whereas it is preserved for the 2d simple square lattice with off - diagonal disorder .",
    "we start from the following expression for the dos @xmath125 which expresses @xmath7 by means of the retarded green s function @xmath126 .",
    "the new class of diagrams which give the dominating contribution to the self  energy of @xmath127 is drawn in fig.[fig : self_energy_diagrams ] .",
    "these diagrams represent the contributions to the self  energy in first order in cooperon and diffuson blocks ( @xmath70 and @xmath128 ) .",
    "since @xmath70 and @xmath128 do not carry an external frequency ( @xmath129 ) , their expressions are obtained from eqs.([eq : cp_sol ] ) and ( [ eq : dp_sol ] ) with @xmath130 :    @xmath131    as @xmath132 , both blocks have a diffusion pole for @xmath133 and @xmath134 . the cooperon and the diffuson blocks give rise to logarithmic corrections to the physical parameters for @xmath40 and @xmath135 corrections for @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , diagrams of higher order in the cooperon and diffuson blocks for the self  energy parts are not necessary for 3d systems for @xmath133 .",
    "nevertheless the logarithmic divergency existing in the first order contribution to the self  energy for 2d systems requires to examine higher order logarithmic corrections .",
    "the structure of the diagrams which contain all possible combinations of diffuson and cooperon blocks becomes complicated with increasing number of inserted blocks .",
    "however , as it has been shown by various theoretical methods , higher logarithmic corrections to the conductance cancel each other@xcite and the leading correction to the conductance is only the first order logarithmic term .",
    "high order corrections to the self  energy seem to cancel each other also in our case . the second order diagrams which give logarithm  squared contributions to the self ",
    "energy are drawn in fig.[fig : self_energy_second_order ] .",
    "straightforward calculations show that the sum of these diagrams gives zero .",
    "the retarded green s function @xmath137 is expressed by the sum of the first  order self  energy parts @xmath138 in fig.[fig : self_energy_diagrams ] according to the dyson equation as @xmath139 by summing the diagrams in fig.[fig : self_energy_diagrams ] one gets the expression for @xmath140 : @xmath141 by substituting eqs.([eq : fullgf ] ) and ( [ eq : sigma ] ) into eq.([eq : rho_from_gf ] ) one obtains the following expression for @xmath7 : @xmath142 with @xmath143 and @xmath144 here , @xmath145 is the dos for a @xmath19dimensional clean crystal and is given by eqs.([eq : rho_2d ] ) and ( [ eq : rho_3d ] ) for @xmath40 and @xmath136 , respectively .",

    "the dos for a 2d system with half  filled energy band can be expressed as @xmath151 where @xmath152 , given by eq.([eq : rho_2d ] ) , contains a logarithmic singularity in the middle of the band .",
    "eq.([eq : rho_2d_sol ] ) shows that the van hove singularity in the dos of a pure 2d square crystal is preserved in the presence of substitutional impurities .",
    "however , the central peak becomes narrower due to impurity scattering than that of the van hove peak in clean systems .",
    "in the vicinity of the band center the energy dependence of @xmath153 is changed from logarithmic dependence to the square root of the logarithm,@xcite @xmath154    in fig.[fig : rho_2d]a the dependence of @xmath153 on the impurity potential strength is drawn , which displays a narrowing of the central peak with increasing disorder strength or decreasing @xmath64 .",
    "the dos of a square lattice with off  diagonal disorder computed in [ ] shows the same effect .",
    "notice that the impurity potential studied in our problem corresponds to off  diagonal disorder , since the part of the hamiltonian eq.([eq : hamiltonian_tight_binding ] ) corresponding to the impurity potential can be decoupled into diagonal ( @xmath155 ) and off  diagonal ( @xmath30 with @xmath156 ) parts .",
    "the diagonal part is chosen to be equal to zero for the white  noise potential@xcite in the averaging process .",
    "unlike 2d systems , substitutional impurities have small effect on the dos of 3d simple cubic crystals . in the close vicinity of half  filling , eq.([eq : alpha ] ) for @xmath157 is simplified : @xmath158 by using eq.([eq : alpha_3d_simplified ] ) , on expresses @xmath159 as @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are real and imaginary parts of @xmath157 , respectively .",

    "the depth of this dip increases with disorder strength as @xmath163 the results obtained for the dos of 2d systems , eqs.([eq : rho_from_alpha])-([eq : rho_2d_singularity ] ) , and 3d systems , eqs.([eq : alpha_3d_simplified])-([eq : rho_3d_dip ] ) , show that in contrast to 1d systems substitutional impurities tend to reduce the dos on the fermi surface of 2d and 3d crystals at half filling .",
    "indeed , the dyson singularity , expressing the enhancement of the states density in the 1d lattice with off  diagonal disorder , is mediated by impurities,@xcite since the dos of a regular 1d lattice is a smooth function of the energy of a half  filled band .",
    "the mechanism of the relative reduction of the dos in 2d [ eq.([eq : rho_2d_sol ] ) ] and 3d [ eq.([eq : rho_3d_simplified ] ) ] systems is umklapp scattering , the same that increases the 1d dos .",
    "however , the nested fermi surface of a 2d square crystal with nearest ",
    "neighbor hopping contains also saddle points at @xmath164 and @xmath165 which cause the van hove singularity in the dos .",
    "umklapp scattering in this case weakens the central van hove peak in the dos , nevertheless it could not damp the peak or reverse its sign .",
    "we understand the different effects of substitutional impurities on the dos of 1d and higher dimensional systems in the following way : the main mechanism of localization in a 1d disordered system is backward scattering on impurities.@xcite in the process of scattering on an impurity , simultaneous bragg reflection at half  filling reverses backward scattering to forward scattering and vice versa .",
    "therefore for vanishingly small forward scattering amplitude@xcite bragg reflection prevents localization due to impurity scattering .",
    "however , the situation is different for 2d and 3d systems .",
    "according to the intuitive discussion given by bergmann,@xcite localization in 2d systems is due to interference of the electronic wave , returning to the starting point after multiple scattering on impurities with only a small change of the momentum at each act of scattering , with the wave on the time ",
    "reversed path ( see also [ ] ) . in this case",
    ", the bragg reflection accompanying the impurity scattering can not destroy the picture of interference and as a result can not completely delocalize all states .",

    "however , the optimal nested fermi surface is realized at @xmath169 and @xmath170 , with the new nesting vector @xmath171.@xcite our method can be applied also for this dispersion band .",
    "the singular blocks are again calculated after separating the large momentum transfer @xmath172 and linearizing the energy spectrum around the fermi surface . as a result the same expression ( [ eq : rho_2d_singularity ] ) ) for the 2d dos is obtained .",
    "however , @xmath173 in this case has no singularity on the fermi surface at half  filling .",
    "therefore @xmath153 decreases with the energy around the fermi surface for half filling and vanishes on it .",
    "the dc - conductivity for the 2d anderson model at zero temperature has been computed in [ ] and the behavior of @xmath14 as a function of the fermi energy and the disorder has been studied .",

    "maximally crossed or `` fan '' diagrams are responsible for the quantum interference corrections to the conductivity in the weak localization theory.@xcite interference between electronic wave functions in the process of multiple scattering on randomly distributed impurities changes the mobility of an electronic system and `` fan '' diagrams give a contribution to the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the conductivity of simple crystalline systems with substitutional impurities can also be affected through changes in the dos due to bragg reflection in the scattering processes on the impurities which becomes essential for an electronic band close to half  filling .",
    "the diagrams which describe first order weak localization corrections to the conductivity and represent both the diffusion coefficient and the dos contributions , are drawn in fig.[fig : conductivity ] .",

    "the question whether delocalized states exist in the center of the band of 2d disordered systems or not is also one of the crucial points for the integer quantum hall effect .",

    "the effect might be observable in the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility according to @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the bohr magneton .",
    "straightforward calculation using eq.([eq : rho_2d_sol ] ) for the 2d dos gives        the first logarithmic corrections to the conductivity of the 2d square lattice with substitutional impurities come from both the diffusion coefficient and the dos .",
