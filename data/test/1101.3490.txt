    "in the last decade , studies about the structure and dynamics of complex networks have blossomed , thanks in particular to the versatility of the network representation , which has turned out to be adequate for systems as diverse as the internet or social networks .",
    "a large body of knowledge about the empirical description of networked systems has thus been accumulated , together with a wealth of modeling techniques ; a good level of understanding of how dynamical processes taking place on networks depend on their structure has been as well reached @xcite .",
    "many network studies have been concerned with systems of interest in several scientific areas a priori remote from physics ( social sciences , biology , computer science , epidemiology , ... ) , and they have also reached more traditional fields of statistical physics , such as the study of glassy systems , as we now describe .",
    "the many puzzles raised by the glass transition , and in particular the slow dynamics displayed by glassy systems at low temperatures , have been the subject of a large interest in the past decades @xcite .",
    "one of the approaches which has led to promising insights consists in the description of the dynamics of a glassy system inside its configuration space .",
    "the energy landscape of a glassy system is typically rugged , made of many local minima ( metastable states ) , whose huge number makes it difficult to reach equilibrium . in this framework ,",
    "the energy landscape is seen as a set of basins of attractions of local minima ( `` traps '' ) , and the system evolves through a succession of harmonic vibrations inside traps and jumps between minima @xcite .",
    "this picture has stimulated the definition and study of various simplified models of dynamical evolution between traps , in order to reproduce the phenomenology of glassy dynamics @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , several studies have focused on obtaining a better understanding of the structure of these local minima .",
    "a way to attain this goal is to perform numerical simulations of small systems , at a fixed temperature , and quenching them at regular time intervals in order to make them reach the nearest local minimum .",
    "information is then gathered on the various local minima , and on the sizes of their basins of attraction .",
    "various studies have investigated , among other issues , the detailed structure of the potential energy landscape , the substructure of minima , and the properties of energy barriers between minima @xcite .",
    "several works have also used the information on the energy landscape to study a master equation for the time evolution of the probability to be in each minimum .",
    "the considered systems range from clusters of lennard - jones atoms to proteins or heteropolymers @xcite .",
    "an interesting property of the modeling of the energy landscape in terms of a set of traps linked by energy barriers , lies in the possibility to define and study its network representation within the context of network theory . in this representation",
    ", each local minimum is associated to a node , and a link is drawn between two nodes whenever it is possible for the system to jump between the basins of attraction of the corresponding minima .",
    "the links can then be defined as weighted and directed , as jumps between minima are not equiprobable , and may be easier in one direction than in the other .",
    "networks of local minima of the energy landscape have thus been built and studied .",
    "these networks have been found to exhibit a small - world character @xcite .",
    "the number of links of each node ( its degree ) turns out to be strongly heterogeneous , possibly with scale - free degree distributions , which have been linked to scale - free distributions of the areas of the basins of attraction @xcite .",
    "complex network analysis tools have also been used to investigate the structure of energy landscapes of various systems of interest , such as lennard - jones atoms , proteins , or spin glasses , among others @xcite .",
    "the energy of a minimum and its degree ( i.e. , the number of other minima which can be reached from this minimum ) have been shown to be correlated , as well as the barriers to overcome to escape from a minimum .",
    "in particular , a logarithmic dependence of the energy of a minimum on its degree has been exhibited , as well as energy barriers increasing as a ( small ) power of the degree of a node @xcite .",
    "no systematic study of these issues has however been performed , and most investigations have been limited to relatively small systems because of computational limitations .",
    "most importantly , the investigations cited above have focused on the topology of the network of minima , conceived as a tool to characterize the energy landscape .",
    "the structure of a network has however a deep impact on the properties of the dynamical processes which take place on it @xcite .",
    "it seems thus adequate to put to use the tools and techniques developed for the analysis of dynamical processes on networks to achieve a better understanding of how the energy landscape structure , represented as a network , affects the system performing a random walk in it , and how the onset of glassy dynamics can be described in this way in a general framework .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite , we have made a first step to fill this gap by focusing on the trap model put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we generalize our approach to more involved transition rates between energy minima .",
    "we show how the heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) theory @xcite can be used in this context to highlight the connection between the topological properties of the network of minima and the dynamical exploration of these minima .",
    "we show in particular that the relationship between energy and degree of the minima is a crucial ingredient for the existence of a transition and the subsequent glassy phenomenology .",
    "our results shed light on the empirically found relationship between the energy of a local minimum and its degree , and we hope that they will stimulate more systematic investigations on this issue .    we have organized our paper as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we define our model of energy landscape dynamics as a random walk on a complex network .",
    "different physical transition rates are proposed , and the corresponding numerical implementation is discussed . in section  [ sec : formalism ] we present a theoretical analysis based on the heterogeneous mean - field approximation for dynamical processes on complex networks .",
    "this formalism is applied in section [ sec : general - formalism ] , where general analytical approximate expression are presented for the main quantities characterizing the glassy transition and dynamics .",
    "these expressions are applied to the different physical transition rates considered in section  [ sec : appl - phys - trans ] , where checks against numerical simulations are also presented . in section  [ sec : barriers ] we discuss the relation between energy basins and energy barriers .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a network of @xmath0 nodes , in which each vertex @xmath1 corresponds to a minimum in the energy landscape , and a link is drawn between two minima @xmath1 and @xmath2 if the system can jump directly from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . to each node @xmath1",
    "is associated the energy @xmath3 of the corresponding minimum ( energies are defined from a reference level , in such a way that @xmath4 for all @xmath1 ) . moreover , an energy gap @xmath5 is associated to the edge between vertices @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as depicted in fig .  [ landscape ] : @xmath5 is a symmetric function , such that the energy barrier that must be overcome to jump from vertex @xmath1 to vertex @xmath2 can be written as @xmath6 and , analogously , @xmath7 . obviously , we will have in general @xmath8 .",
    "are measured positive downwards .",
    "energy gaps @xmath5 are defined positive upwards.,width=340 ]    the system under investigation is pictured as a walker exploring the network through a biased random walk .",
    "the rate ( probability per unit time ) @xmath9 to go from vertex @xmath1 to vertex @xmath2 depends a priori on the energy at vertices @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath2 and/or the energy barrier between @xmath1 and @xmath2 that must be overcome . the random walk model is defined in discrete time @xmath10 as follows :    * at time @xmath10 , the walker is in vertex @xmath1 .",
    "* it chooses at random a neighbor of @xmath1 , namely @xmath2 . * with a probability @xmath9 , that depends on the energy @xmath11 and/or on the energy barrier @xmath12 , the walker hops to vertex @xmath2 . * time is updated @xmath13 .",
    "the relationship between the probabilities @xmath9 and the energy and energy barriers can be of different forms . in usual unbiased random walks , @xmath9 is a constant independent of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite . as a first step to introduce a dependence on the nodes ,",
    "a possible approach is that in which the energy barriers depend only on the local minima themselves , i.e. we consider @xmath14 .",
    "for example , in the bouchaud trap model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , the probability to exit from a trap is just an arrhenius law depending only on the departing trap s depth , namely @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the inverse temperature and @xmath17 is a constant that determines a global timescale .",
    "other possible definitions include the metropolis one @xmath18 and the glauber rate @xmath19 we note that the rates considered in the bouchaud trap model are quite different from the metropolis or glauber rates . indeed , while the former depends only on the depth of the originating trap , the latter depend also on the energy of the arriving vertex .",
    "this translates in the fact that , in the limit of zero temperature , the dynamics of the bouchaud trap model is frozen for any @xmath11 , while metropolis and glauber dynamics still allow jumps to lower energy minima @xcite . within an even more realistic representation of glassy dynamics , one can also contemplate the case @xmath20 , allowing for the transition rates to depend explicitly on the energy barriers between adjacent minima . as a paradigm of this choice , we propose a rate of the arrhenius form @xmath21 which acts a straightforward generalization of the local transition rate ( [ eq : rate_traps ] ) .",
    "the case of rate ( [ eq : rate_traps ] ) ( local trapping ) was studied in a previous publication @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will consider in turn non - local rates ( [ eq : rate_metropolis ] ) , ( [ eq : rate_glauber ] ) and ( [ eq : rate_barriers ] ) and discuss the fundamental differences due to the introduction of energy barriers in the model .",
    "we emphasize that our model differs both from usual unbiased random walks , as the local energy determines the transition rates , and from mean - field trap models in which jumps between any pair of energy minima are a priori possible : here , the system can jump only between neighboring nodes .",
    "the dynamical evolution depends therefore both on the network topology and on the energies associated to the nodes .      to implement numerically the random walk , it is convenient to resort to the techniques developed for general diffusion processes on complex weighted networks @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of this method is to avoid rejection steps , thus improving dramatically the computational efficiency @xcite .",
    "therefore , at each simulation step the random walker sitting at node @xmath1 selects a neighbor @xmath2 with probability @xmath22 , where the sum in the normalizing factor is extended to all of @xmath1 s neighbors . as the walker hops on node @xmath2 , the physical time is incremented by an interval @xmath23 drawn from the exponential distribution @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the inverse of the average escape rate out of node @xmath1 . in this way",
    "the simulation time is disentangled from the physical time and the latter has no impact on the simulation efficiency .",
    "no matter how much physical time a walker spends in a node , from the simulation time point of view it is always just a time step .    the network substrates on which we will focus are scale - free networks with a degree distribution of the form @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ". we will generate them with the uncorrelated configuration model ( ucm ) @xcite , that allows us to tune the degree distribution to the desired form and prevents the formation of degree - degree correlations .",
    "networks are therefore generated as follows : a number of stubs ( or semi - links ) extracted from the desired final degree distribution is assigned to each node .",
    "stubs are then randomly paired to form links between nodes , with the prescription that multiple links as well as self - loops must be avoided . a minimal degree @xmath28 is fixed a priori . to avoid spurious effects due to the possible presence of tree - like structures",
    "@xcite it is convenient to adopt @xmath29 .",
    "we will choose @xmath30 in all of our simulations .",
    "so far the algorithm coincides with the one of the configuration model @xcite , but the ucm introduces moreover a cutoff to the degree distribution , @xmath31 , which avoids the formation of degree correlations by limiting the size of the hubs @xcite .",
    "in order to gain analytical understanding of the role of the different transition rates in the corresponding glassy dynamics , we apply a standard heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) formalism @xcite .",
    "the basic tenet of hmf is the assumption that all the dynamical properties of a vertex depend only on its degree .",
    "vertices are thus grouped into classes according to their degree , and vertices with the same degree are treated as equivalent .",
    "this approximation is consistent with previous findings that have uncovered the correlations between the energy of a local minimum and the degree of the corresponding node in the network @xcite .",
    "we therefore make the assumption that there exists a relationship @xmath32 where the function @xmath33 is a characteristic of the model .",
    "this also means that the distributions of energies @xmath34 of the system s landscape , and the degree distribution @xmath35 of the corresponding network are linked through @xmath36 . in the same spirit",
    ", we make the further assumption that the energy gap between minima @xmath1 and @xmath2 depends only on the degrees of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , i.e. , that it can be written as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a symmetric function of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    under the hmf approximation",
    "the dynamics will thus focus on the transitions between different degree classes .",
    "the rate to go from a vertex @xmath39 to a vertex @xmath40 can be written as @xmath41 the function @xmath42 , defined as the conditional probability that a vertex of degree @xmath39 is connected with another vertex of degree @xmath40 @xcite , takes into account the topological features of the network , by gauging the probability of selecting a vertex @xmath40 as neighbor of @xmath39 .",
    "the function @xmath43 measures the rate of jumping from a vertex of degree @xmath39 to a vertex of degree @xmath40 ( given that they are connected by an edge ) , and depends on @xmath39 and @xmath40 through the rates @xmath44 and the functions @xmath36 and @xmath45 . obviously , the rate @xmath43 is not in general a symmetric function of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "it is worth noting that , apart from a normalization , equation  ( [ eq : weighted_propagator ] ) is simply the so - called weighted propagator describing the probability that a node in class @xmath39 interacts with a node in class @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we also note that the rates @xmath43 depend on the inverse temperature @xmath46 through the microscopic rates @xmath9 .",
    "in this section , we apply the hmf theory to compute different quantities relevant for the characterization of the dynamics of a random walk in a complex energy landscape represented in terms of a network of minima .",
    "the description of a random walk dynamics starts from the occupation probability @xmath47 , defined as the probability for the walker to be in _ any _ node of degree @xmath39 at a time @xmath48 .",
    "its time evolution can be easily represented in terms of a master equation of the form @xmath49 upon describing the state at time @xmath48 with the row vector @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the cutoff or largest degree in the network , equation ( [ rate_scalar ] ) can be rewritten in vector form as @xmath52 where the matrix @xmath53 , with elements @xmath54 is a generalization of a laplacian matrix to the case of directed weighted graphs .",
    "the matrix elements satisfy @xmath55 which ensures conservation of probability and states that the columns of @xmath53 are not linearly independent .",
    "the real part of every eigenvalue of @xmath53 is non - negative @xcite . as a consequence , all solutions of eq .",
    "( [ rate_vectorial ] ) , which can be formally written as @xmath56 are stable according to lyapunov criteria .",
    "in particular , since @xmath57 , @xmath53 always has the eigenvalue @xmath58 , which corresponds to a constant solution of the problem . at this point",
    "one can proceed in close analogy with discrete - time regular markov chains @xcite . by making the assumption that the matrix @xmath59 is non - negative and irreducible ( indeed it is for every choice of @xmath60 in the following )",
    ", we can prove that the @xmath58 eigenvalue of @xmath53 has algebraic multiplicity @xmath61 .",
    "hence , the stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ rate_vectorial ] ) is unique .      in order to calculate the steady solution @xmath62 in the limit @xmath63",
    ", one can impose @xmath64 .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath65 so that we are left with the task of finding the left nullspace of @xmath53 .",
    "( [ homogeneous_v ] ) is a homogeneous system of algebraic linear equations .",
    "it admits non - trivial solutions since @xmath66 . in our case ,",
    "the solution to ( [ homogeneous_v ] ) can be easily found by imposing the detailed balance condition .",
    "namely , writing eq .",
    "( [ homogeneous_v ] ) as @xmath67=0 ,      \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] we can obtain a solution by imposing that the terms inside the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) cancel individually , that is @xmath68 substituting the form of @xmath69 , we obtain @xmath70 where in the last step we have used the degree detailed balance condition @xmath71 which simply expresses that the number of edges from a node of degree @xmath39 to a node of degree @xmath40 is equal to the number of edges from a node of degree @xmath40 to a node of degree @xmath39 @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , we see that its right - hand - side must be expressible as a simple ratio of a function of @xmath39 over a function of @xmath40 . a general way to obtain this is to impose a coarse - grained rate @xmath60 taking the general form @xmath72 in other words , we assume that the rate @xmath60 can be written as the product of a function of @xmath40 , a function of @xmath39 , and a symmetric function @xmath73 ( where @xmath39 and @xmath40 need not be separable ) .",
    "we will see later that all the rates @xmath74 defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : definition ] ( traps , glauber , metropolis , and energy barriers ) can be written in such a form .",
    "the stationary solution is then given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a normalizing constant determined by the condition @xmath77 .",
    "such a solution is unique , as proven above .",
    "interestingly , the symmetric function @xmath78 does not enter the steady solution , although it will play a role in affecting the transient behavior , as we will see in the next sections .      the steady state solution found above for the occupation probability",
    "is defined if and only if the normalization constant @xmath79 is finite .",
    "when this condition is met , the random walker reaches an equilibrium state with a distribution @xmath80 . on the other hand ,",
    "whenever such condition is not met , the random walker is unable to reach a steady state , i.e. the steady solution to the rate equation does not correspond to any physical steady state in equilibrium @xmath81 .",
    "we identify this region of the phase space with the glass phase for our random walker @xcite .    the functions @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    "depend on the temperature , on the precise dynamics chosen ( traps , glauber , metropolis ) , and encode the relationship @xmath36 between energy and degree of the minima .",
    "the degree distribution moreover enters explicitly the expression @xmath84 .",
    "as the various parameters of the model are changed , it is thus a priori possible to go from one phase in which @xmath84 is finite to one in which @xmath84 diverges . in a physical system in particular , the control parameter is usually the temperature , while the topology of the network of minima and the function @xmath36 are given .",
    "it is then clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) that the presence or absence of a finite glass transition temperature @xmath85 , such that @xmath84 becomes infinite for @xmath86 , depends on the interplay between the topology of the landscape network ( as determined by @xmath35 ) and the functions @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "interestingly , at this mean - field level , the existence of a transition does not depend on the network degree correlations , since the conditional probability @xmath42 do not enter eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "let us consider for instance a network of minima with a heavy - tailed degree distribution such as @xmath26 .",
    "a transition between a finite and an infinite @xmath84 can be observed if and only if @xmath87 behaves at large @xmath39 in the form @xmath88 where the exponent @xmath89 depends on the temperature , and can take values smaller or larger than @xmath90 depending on the temperature .",
    "another example is given by a stretched exponential form for @xmath35 , @xmath91 , in which case a transition is observed if and only if @xmath87 is of the form @xmath92 , with @xmath93 a function of the temperature ( the transition is then given by @xmath94 ) .      in any finite system , unless the product function @xmath87 exhibits some sort of singularity , the normalization constant eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) is finite and the steady state distribution @xmath95 exists , the occupation probability @xmath47 converging to it after an equilibration time , i.e. @xmath96 the corresponding thermalization of the occupation probability occurs in a way depending on the function @xmath36 .",
    "shallow energy minima are indeed explored first , while deep traps ( large @xmath97 ) are visited at larger times @xcite .",
    "if @xmath36 is a growing function of @xmath39 , as indeed found empirically @xcite , small degree nodes correspond to shallow minima , and deeper minima are associated to larger nodes .",
    "the evolution of @xmath47 takes then place in a hierarchical fashion : the small degree region equilibrates first , and progressive equilibration of larger degree regions takes place at larger times . in this respect , we obtain a strong difference between the biased random walk that the glassy system experiences and usual diffusion processes corresponding to unbiased random walks , which visit first large degree vertices and then cascade down towards small degree nodes @xcite , in the present case we observe an `` inverse cascade process '' from small vertices to hubs .",
    "we have found in @xcite that , in the case of a random walk among traps , this hierarchical thermalization is summarized in a scaling form for @xmath47 , which can be written as @xmath98 where @xmath99 represents the maximum degree of the vertices equilibrated up to time @xmath48 , and @xmath100 interpolates between @xmath101 at small @xmath102 and the short time form of @xmath103 which is proportional to @xmath104 .",
    "we will see in the next section that a similar scaling is obeyed for other transition rates .",
    "in general , for the glassy dynamics , the functional form of @xmath99 can moreover be obtained through the following argument : the total time @xmath48 can be written as the sum of the trapping times spent in the vertices that have been visited since the beginning of the dynamics .",
    "trapping times increase with the depth of the minimum , hence with the degree ( we are still considering the case of an increasing function @xmath33 ) , and , in the glassy phase , the consequence is that the sum of trapping times is dominated by the vertex with the largest degree visited up to that point , namely @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , the average trapping time @xmath106 at a given vertex @xmath39 can be estimated as the inverse of the average escape rate @xmath107 from that vertex : @xmath108 we can therefore estimate @xmath99 , the typical degree up to which nodes are `` equilibrated '' at time @xmath48 , by approximating @xmath109 , and solving the equation @xmath110 to obtain @xmath105 as a function of @xmath48 . note that the result depends here on the function @xmath111 and not only on @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath36 and @xmath35 .",
    "the properties of the system can be further quantified by measuring the average time @xmath112 required by the random walker to escape from the vertex it occupies at time @xmath48 @xcite . for small waiting times",
    "@xmath48 , @xmath113 increases as a result of the transient equilibration of @xmath114 . for large @xmath48 , such that @xmath115 is close enough to the equilibrium @xmath116",

    "( [ eq:7 ] ) , yielding @xmath119 most interestingly , the explicit form of the average escape time @xmath113 depends explicitely on the symmetric function @xmath111 as well as on the network degree correlations , as expressed by the conditional probability @xmath42 .",
    "let us go back to the issue of the existence of a glass transition in the model .",
    "we first recall the phenomenology of the fully connected trap model , with transition rates @xmath120 for any @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where the energies @xmath11 are random numbers extracted from a distribution @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "as all traps are connected with each other , all traps are equiprobable after a jump , so that the probability for the system to be in a trap of depth @xmath97 is simply @xmath34 , and the average rest time spent in a trap is @xmath121 .",
    "a transition between a high temperature phase and a glassy one is thus obtained if and only if , when @xmath46 increases , @xmath122 is finite at small @xmath46 and diverges at a finite @xmath85 . such a phenomenology is obtained if and only if @xmath34 is of the form @xmath123 at large @xmath97 ( else the transition temperature is either @xmath58 or @xmath124 ) , and the transition temperature is then @xmath125 @xcite .    in the present case of a nework of minima ,",
