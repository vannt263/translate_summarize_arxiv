    "it is by now well - known that quantum field theory permits violations of all of the local energy conditions used in classical general relativity .",
    "these conditions are employed in a variety of ways , such as in the proofs of theorems on the occurrence of singularities in gravitational collapse and cosmology , or of cosmic censorship .",
    "two of the weakest such local conditions are the `` weak energy condition '' and the `` null energy condition '' which state that : @xmath0 for all timelike vectors @xmath1 , and @xmath2 for all null vectors @xmath3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that the null energy condition follows by continuity if the weak energy condition holds .",
    "these two local conditions are satisfied by known forms of classical matter , but there are a variety of states of quantum fields which violate them @xcite , the most well - known of which is arguably the casimir vacuum @xcite",
    ".    the extent to which quantum field theory allows violations of the local energy conditions is not yet completely clear , although progress has been made in recent years to answer this question .",
    "two principal approaches for determining the degree of violation have been `` averaged energy conditions '' and `` quantum inequalities . ''",
    "the first , originally due to tipler @xcite , involves a suitable averaging of the local conditions over timelike or null geodesics .",
    "it can be shown that many of the standard results of classical general relativity obtained via global techniques can be proved using only the averaged , rather than the local , energy conditions @xcite-@xcite . here",
    "we take the `` averaged weak energy condition '' ( awec ) to be @xmath4 where the integral is taken over a timelike geodesic with tangent vector @xmath1 and parameterized by the proper time @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , we take the `` averaged null energy condition '' ( anec ) to be @xmath6 where the integral is taken over an affinely parameterized null geodesic with tangent vector @xmath3 and affine parameter @xmath7 @xcite",
    ". there has been a great deal of effort in the last several years to determine whether quantum field theory enforces averaged energy conditions .",
    "most of this activity has been concentrated primarily on anec @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is in part due to the discovery that violations of anec are required to maintain traversable wormholes @xcite .",
    "it appears that although anec holds for a wide class of quantum states in a variety of spacetimes , it does not hold in an arbitrary four - dimensional curved spacetime ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for more detailed discussions ) . however , it is quite plausible that a suitable generalization of anec may hold in more general spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the second approach involves uncertainty principle - type inequalities , derived from quantum field theory , which restrict the magnitude and duration of negative energy fluxes or densities @xcite .",
    "for example , one such `` quantum inequality '' ( qi ) for negative energy fluxes seen by inertial observers in two - dimensional flat spacetime has the form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the magnitude of the negative energy flux and @xmath10 is its duration .",
    "this inequality implies that @xmath11 , the amount of negative energy transmitted in time @xmath10 , is limited by @xmath12 therefore , @xmath11 is less than the quantum uncertainty in the energy , @xmath13 , on the timescale @xmath10 .",
    "recently , more precise versions of these inequalities have been derived @xcite .",
    "these involve an integral of the energy flux multiplied by a `` sampling function '' , i.e. , a peaked function of time with a time integral of unity and characteristic width @xmath14 .",
    "a convenient choice @xcite of such a function is @xmath15 $ ] . if the integrated flux , @xmath16 , is defined by @xmath17 then these inequalities may be written as @xmath18 and @xmath19 for all @xmath14 , in two- and four - dimensions , respectively .",
    "these inequalities have the form required to prevent macroscopic violations of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "it was also discovered that similar inequalities hold for a quantized massless , minimally - coupled scalar field propagating on two- and four - dimensional extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole backgrounds .",
    "these inequalities were shown to foil attempts to produce an unambiguous violation of cosmic censorship by injecting a negative energy flux into an extreme charged black hole @xcite .",
    "the latter results provide perhaps one of the strongest reasons for the belief that the production of large - scale effects via manipulation of negative energy may be forbidden by quantum field theory .",
    "classically , _ any _ amount of negative energy , no matter how small , injected into an extreme black hole is enough to produce a naked singularity .",
    "therefore , if one had any chance of producing gross effects with negative energy , the scenario discussed above would seem to have offered the best possibility of success .",
    "it should also be emphasized that the energy - time uncertainty principle was _ not _ used as input in the derivation of any of the qi restrictions .",
    "they arise directly from quantum field theory .    in a recent paper",
    ", we have shown that there exist deep connections between averaged energy conditions and quantum inequalities , at least in flat spacetime @xcite . for a quantized massless , minimally - coupled scalar field in two- and four - dimensional minkowski spacetime , we have derived analogous qi s to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fqi/2d ] ) and  ( [ eq : fqi/4d ] ) for energy density . in particular , for timelike geodesics in two - dimensional flat spacetime , @xmath20 for all @xmath14 .",

    "( [ eq : tlqi2duncp ] ) converges , even though the associated awec integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : awec ] ) diverges .",
    "analogous results hold in this case for null geodesics .    for a quantized massless scalar field in a two - dimensional minkowski spacetime with compactified spatial dimension",
    ", it was also discovered that the _ difference _ between the expectation values of @xmath24 , or @xmath25 , in an arbitrary quantum state and in the casimir vacuum state obey awec and anec - type inequalities @xcite .",
    "this is surprising since it is known @xcite that awec and anec are violated for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , in the ( renormalized ) casimir vacuum state by itself .",
    "such `` difference inequalities '' might provide new measures of the degree of energy condition violation in cases where the usual averaged energy conditions fail .",
    "this approach has recently been generalized to arbitrary two - dimensional curved spacetimes by yurtsever @xcite .    for a quantized massless , minimally - coupled scalar field in four - dimensional minkowski spacetime",
    ", we also derived the following inequality for timelike geodesics @xmath28 for all @xmath14 . from this inequality",
    ", it was shown that one can derive awec and anec @xcite .",
    "( the application of qi bounds to constrain the dimensions of traversable wormholes is discussed in a separate manuscript@xcite . )    in almost all studies of anec for quantum fields , the bounds on the anec integral have been taken from @xmath29 to @xmath30 @xcite . however , a question of some interest is whether anec is satisfied in the spacetime of an object collapsing to form a black hole .",
    "the answer to this question might determine , for example , whether penrose s singularity theorem @xcite will still hold in the presence of local violations of the energy conditions , such as the hawking evaporation process @xcite .",
    "in this case , one is usually concerned with the focusing of null geodesics which generate the boundary of the future of a trapped surface . to prove penrose s theorem , one would want anec to hold over these half - complete geodesics @xcite .",
    "this is a stronger condition to impose than to demand that anec hold over full ( i.e. , past and future - complete ) geodesics .",
    "however , even if this version of anec fails in some regions of a given spacetime , it may hold in enough other regions so that the conclusions of penrose s theorem will still be valid .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that anec is a sufficient condition to insure continued focusing of null geodesics .",
    "one can also guarantee focusing with other conditions , for example by allowing the right - hand - side of the anec integral to be only periodically non - negative @xcite , or even negative but bounded ( see lemma 3 of ref .",

    "it could be argued that it is no surprise that evaluation of the anec integral for null geodesics inside the horizon yields a divergent positive result .",

    "however , it is not obvious , a priori , what the _ sign _ of these integrals should be . since these are test fields on a given background , as opposed to fields which generate the background spacetime ( which we can not have in any case in 2d ) , it is possible that the integrals might have turned out to diverge with either sign .",
    "similar anec integrals for quantized massless fermion fields in 2d have the same signs as for the massless scalar field .",
    "this follows from the fact that the renormalized fermion stress tensor is identical to that in the scalar case @xcite , even though the formally divergent tensors have opposite signs in the two cases .",

    "in this paper , we have examined awec and anec in both two and four- dimensional evaporating schwarzschild black hole spacetimes , for quantized massless scalar and electromagnetic fields .",
    "our 2d results are the following : it was discovered that awec is satisfied for outgoing radial timelike geodesics which start just outside the horizon and reach infinity , for the unruh vacuum state .",

    "similarly , anec is violated for half - complete outgoing radial null geodesics , which start just outside the horizon , in both the unruh and boulware vacuum states .",
    "this is also true on the horizon in the unruh vacuum state .",
    "however , anec is satisfied along ingoing null geodesics and along outgoing null geodesics inside the horizon in the unruh vacuum state , due to a large positive contribution to the integral near the singularity .    in 4d , we examined awec and anec in the unruh vacuum state , using previously calculated numerical values of the stress - tensor components .",

    "this condition is violated for orbiting null geodesics as well .",
    "however , in all cases where the conditions are violated , there appear to be qi - type bounds which limit the degree of the violations .",

    "the corresponding inequalities have additional factors of @xmath226 on the right - hand - sides .",
    "can the semi - classical effects of negative energy , in processes such as black hole evaporation , invalidate the singularity theorems before quantum gravity effects become significant ?",
    "although we do not have a definite proof in the general case , our results suggest that the answer may be no .",
    "it remains possible that even though anec ( or even a weaker energy condition @xcite ) might fail in some regions of a given spacetime , it may hold in enough other regions for the conclusions of the singularity theorems to be maintained .",
    "our ( admittedly ) 2d results for anec would seem to support this view . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that if anec is satisfied along the null geodesics which generate the boundary of the future of a trapped surface , then penrose s singularity theorem will still hold . there",
    "the local null energy condition was replaced by anec along half - complete null geodesics .",
    "however , two points should be emphasized about that result .",
    "first , it is not necessary to assume that the anec integral is non - negative to prove the result @xcite .",
    "in fact , from lemma 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite or eq .",
    "( 5 ) of ref . @xcite and the einstein equations , it is sufficient to have @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the initial expansion of the null geodesic congruence at the trapped surface .",
    "the anec integral may be negative as long as it is not more negative than @xmath229 .",
    "physically this implies that a singularity will still form provided that the defocusing effects due to the presence of any negative energy are more than compensated for by the initial convergence of the null geodesics produced by the trapped surface .",
    "second , the existence of only _",
    "one _ such trapped surface whose orthogonal null geodesics obey either anec or the weaker inequality , eq .",
    "( [ eq : w - anec ] ) , is required to prove the occurrence of a singularity .",
    "there may exist other trapped surfaces in the spacetime whose orthogonal null geodesics do not obey either of the inequalities .",
    "however , as long as there exists _ at least one _ trapped surface with the desired properties , a singularity is inevitable .",
    "consider an evaporating black hole spacetime , with backreaction included .",
    "the penrose diagram for the standard scenario is shown in fig .",
    "let us assume that this standard picture is correct .",
    "the line @xmath230 is the event horizon , the dashed curve @xmath231 is the apparent horizon , and the lines @xmath232 , @xmath233 , and @xmath234 are outgoing null geodesics orthogonal to the trapped surfaces labelled @xmath235 , @xmath236 , and @xmath237 , respectively .",
    "the outgoing null rays from @xmath235 do not focus but instead reach future null infinity , so one expects that _ any _ averaged energy condition which would insure focusing , such as anec or eq .",
    "( [ eq : w - anec ] ) , would fail along them .",
    "the closest analogs to these rays in our analysis are the outgoing null rays just outside the horizon shown in fig .",
    "it was found that in both two and four - dimensional schwarzschild spacetime , anec was violated along these rays , although in each case a qi limits the degree of the violation .",
    "one would expect that if an analogous qi holds in more general cases , such as fig .",
    "( 3 ) , it will not be strong enough to guarantee focusing of null rays in the region between @xmath230 and @xmath231 in fig .",
    "we could not examine the weaker inequality eq .",
    "( [ eq : w - anec ] ) , since in a static evaporating black hole background there are no trapped surfaces outside the horizon . for the outgoing null rays from @xmath236 in fig .",
    "( 3 ) ( a trapped surface inside the collapsing matter ) , one would suspect that anec probably holds . in this case",
    ", the focusing effects of the matter of the star most likely overwhelm any defocusing by negative energy .",
    "for the outgoing null rays from @xmath237 ( a trapped surface `` behind '' the event horizon , in the vacuum outside the collapsing matter ) , one might expect either anec or a similar but weaker inequality such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : w - anec ] ) to hold , since the null rays eventually do run into a singularity .",
    "this is assuming , of course , that the `` standard '' scenario depicted in fig .",
    "( 3 ) is in fact the correct one - a view which could well be wrong . in our 2d analysis",
    ", we found that anec was satisfied along these rays , and also along ingoing null rays .",
    "we showed that our approximation of neglecting backreaction should fail only when the time of escape of a null ray from near the horizon is comparable to the evaporation time of the black hole .",
    "this implied that such a ray would have to start out extremely close to the horizon .",
    "nevertheless , it would be useful to attempt a similar analysis to ours for evaporating black hole spacetimes with backreaction taken into account .",
    "the situation is complicated by our ignorance of the detailed form of the stress - tensor components in such cases .",
    "recent work of kuo and ford @xcite has shown that negative energy densities in flat spacetime are subject to large fluctuations . in these circumstances",
    ", one does not expect the semi - classical einstein equations to be a good approximation . if the same is true of negative energy densities in curved spacetime , and we see no reason to believe otherwise , then the question arises as to whether such fluctuations could cause a gross failure of the semi - classical approximation at scales well above the planck scale",
    ". large stress - tensor fluctuations would presumably produce large fluctuations in spacetime geometry .",
    "therefore , it is very important to determine whether such fluctuations might render suspect the semi - classical picture of the hawking process , or the conclusions of the singularity theorems in the presence of negative energy . on the other hand it could turn out , for example in the hawking process ,",
    "that if the timescale of the stress - tensor fluctuations is very short compared to other relevant time scales , such as the evaporation time of the hole , then the standard analysis may still be valid . in the proofs of the singularity theorems",
    ", one assumes a fixed classical spacetime background which determines the causal structure .",
    "if the background geometry fluctuates , it is not clear that the usual global techniques employed in classical general relativity will still be useful @xcite .",

    "<S> in this paper the averaged weak ( awec ) and averaged null ( anec ) energy conditions , together with uncertainty principle - type restrictions on negative energy ( `` quantum inequalities '' ) , are examined in the context of evaporating black hole backgrounds in both two and four dimensions . in particular , integrals over only half - geodesics are studied . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the regions of the spacetime in which the averaged energy conditions are violated . in all cases where these conditions fail , </S>",
    "<S> there appear to be quantum inequalities which bound the magnitude and extent of the negative energy , and hence the degree of the violation . </S>",
