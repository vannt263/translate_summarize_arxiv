    "the formation and evolution of structures in the universe , such as galaxy clusters and large - scale structures , are part of the most important issue in astrophysics .",
    "since clustering properties of galaxies in the distant universe give us great clues to this issue , many observations have been done in order to detect ( proto ) clusters of galaxies at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "these deep surveys of galaxies , which have significantly advanced our understanding of the properties and distribution of galaxies at high redshifts , are equally important in constraining the underlying structure formation scenarios .",
    "@xcite showed a region around a radio galaxy in which number density of ly@xmath8 emitters ( laes ) is much higher than the mean of the universe suggested by @xcite at @xmath10 .",
    "the region has size of 2.7 @xmath11 1.8 mpc ( physical ) and mass of @xmath12 .",
    "more recently , @xcite found that laes are clustered in an elongated region with a size of 20 @xmath11 50 mpc ( comoving ) at @xmath9 , which is comparable to the size of present - day large - scale structures . in this elongated region , there is a circular region of high surface density of laes with 12 mpc radius , which may be a progenitor of a galaxy cluster .",
    "they also estimated the bias parameter of the laes in the range of @xmath13@xmath14 for spatially flat low - density cosmological model ( @xmath0cdm model ) .",
    "the elongated distribution of the laes in this region is also proposed to be a part of large - scale structures , although observation by @xcite of the same sky area which is closer to us by 39mpc ( comoving ) does not show large structure .",
    "in addition , @xcite reported that laes distribution at @xmath15 in their observed area shows broad large scale structure .",
    "they claim that this structure can not be explained in the context of the standard cdm model .",
    "@xcite observed laes at @xmath16 and discovered filamentary structures and voids .    although these regions which have much high number densities of laes are claimed to be proto - clusters , there is not yet enough detailed study on these possibilities .",
    "therefore , we investigate formation and evolution of galaxy clusters in early universe using cosmological simulation . in this letter",
    "we report some properties of simulated proto - clusters at @xmath17 and compare our numerical results with observations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we perform a cosmological n - body simulation with particle - particle - particle - mesh ( @xmath18 ) algorithm@xcite .",
    "our simulation code is the same one which was used in @xcite .",
    "we use the following values as parameters of our simulation : the hubble constant in units of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , the density parameter , @xmath21 , the baryon density parameter , @xmath22 , the root mean square density fluctuation amplitude on a scale @xmath23 , @xmath24 , the power - law index of the primordial density fluctuation , @xmath25 , and the cosmological constant parameter , @xmath26 .",
    "we employ @xmath27 dark matter particles and the mass of each one is @xmath28 .",
    "the size of the comoving simulation box , @xmath29 , is @xmath30 , and the box is on the periodic boundary condition .",
    "this size of the box is large enough to realize a sufficient number of clusters and large - scale structures at @xmath31 .",
    "we use the spline ( s2 ) softening function for gravitational softening , and the softening length , @xmath32 , is set to be @xmath33 ( @xmath34 in the comoving scale ) .",
    "we identify dark halos in a manner similar to that of @xcite .",
    "a brief explanation of the identification is as follows : first , we define densities of dark matter particles using an interpolation technique in the same way of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method @xcite , and pick up particles whose densities are more than the virial density .",
    "next , we perform the hierarchical friends - of - friends ( hfof ) method @xcite for the selected dense particles . the maximum linking length @xmath35 in hfof method is defined as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the mean inter - particle distance for all ( not only dense ) particles .",
    "then we draw a sphere of which the center is on the densest particle of the group and seek the radius in which the mean density of total matter is equal to the virial density .",
    "we regard the set of particles in the sphere as a virialized object .",
    "if a centroid of a sphere exists in another sphere , only the set which belongs to the more massive sphere is used .",
    "we regard dark halos which have mass of more than @xmath38 at @xmath31 as galaxy clusters and we analyze properties of their progenitors to compare with the observations of proto - cluster regions @xcite .",
    "we seek proto - clusters in high redshift universe as follows : first , we pick up all particles in each cluster at @xmath31 .",
    "next , we trace those particles back to high - z epoch , e.g.  @xmath17 .",
    "finally , we set a minimum cubic region which covers all of the particles .",
    "we call the region as `` proto - cluster region '' for the cluster .",
    "this region contains the proto - cluster of the present cluster .    in order to investigate galaxy distribution in the proto - cluster regions , we identify galaxy - size dark halos ( @xmath39 ) in the regions at @xmath17 .",
    "dark halos of this mass scale are suggested to contain laes and lbgs from their spatial distribution arguments @xcite .",
    "in proto - cluster regions , it is expected that dark halos which correspond to galaxies concentrate much denser than the background .",
    "therefore the excess of number density of dark halos , @xmath40 , should be useful quantities to compare the result of the simulation to observations : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the halo number density averaged in the suitable scale ( e.g.  25 mpc ) and @xmath43 is the background halo number density .",
    "the mass overdensity , @xmath44 , is defined in a similar way : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the density of the region under consideration and @xmath47 is that of the background .",
    "the combination of the halo overdensity and the mass overdensity give us important information of mass concentration , so - called bias information , which has been investigated in analytical and numerical works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find 63 galaxy clusters with @xmath48 in the simulation box at the present epoch ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we seek their progenitors , i.e.  proto - clusters , in high redshift universe and study their properties .",
    "we show an example of present galaxy clusters and proto - cluster regions in our simulation box at @xmath17 in figure [ fig : plot_ex ] .    in our numerical results ,",
    "the size of the proto - cluster regions is in the range of 2040mpc in the comoving scale .",
    "the extension is similar to that of the laes dense region observed by @xcite .",
    "several dark halos with @xmath49 already exist in proto - cluster regions at @xmath17 as shown in figure [ fig : plot_ex](c ) .",
    "we obtain bulk velocity of each dark halo in the proto - cluster regions and found that dispersion of those are typically @xmath50 .",
    "we calculate @xmath40 and @xmath44 for each proto - cluster regions at @xmath17 , by assuming a smoothing scale of 25 mpc ( comoving ) that is a typical proto - cluster size in our numerical results . in order to show that the values of these indicators have significant excess than the mean value of the universe , we randomly select @xmath51 regions in the simulation box and calculate @xmath40 and @xmath44 for these regions .",
    "the number of the randomly selected regions is 630 , which is 10 times more numerous than the proto - cluster regions .",
    "we show the histograms of @xmath40 in figure [ fig : histogram_dhalo ] , where the red solid line is for the proto - cluster regions and the green dashed line is for the randomly selected regions .",
    "the red solid line is significantly different from the green dashed line .",
    "figure [ fig : histogram_dhalo ] shows that the typical value of @xmath40 is @xmath52 for the proto - cluster regions , and its variance is very large .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath40 in most of the randomly selected regions are almost @xmath53 , where this value means that there is no massive dark halo in the regions .",

    "the relation between the @xmath44-@xmath40 given by the natural bias theory agrees well with our numerical results as shown in figure [ fig : scat_dm_dh ] , except for gradual deviation @xmath59 .",
    "this deviation may be explained by the effect of limitation of our simulation box size .",
    "our simulation box size is not enough to consider large - scale ( 100@xmath60 ) component of density fluctuation and this limitation may cause underestimation of mass function for @xmath61 dark halos at @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "it is very interesting to study a critical value of @xmath40 by which we can select a region as the proto - cluster regions . from figure",
    "[ fig : dh_z5_mmax_z0 ] , we have found that more than 80% of the regions with @xmath64 at @xmath17 contain rich clusters ( @xmath66 ) at the present epoch .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath64 is a good criterion to distinguish proto - cluster regions from field regions at @xmath17 .",
    "this criterion is very useful to judge whether observed galaxies excess regions are actual proto - clusters or not .",
    "it should be pointed out that there are a few regions which do not contain clusters at @xmath31 but have large @xmath40 values ( 37 ) at @xmath17 , although a fraction of those regions are very small .",
    "we discuss that the physical origin of the large @xmath40 is non - linearity and stochasticity of bias parameters proposed by @xcite .",
    "they studied variance of biasing parameters , and conclude that the variance increases strongly with redshift .",
    "they also conclude that stochasticity of the biasing is generated by the scatter in the halo mass distribution at higher redshift .",
    "@xcite confirmed these results for @xmath67 by large @xmath18 simulation .",
    "we conclude that our results for @xmath68 are consistent with their results and the trend of evolution of bias variance is still true for @xmath69 .",
    "we compare our results with the observation of @xcite .",
    "properties of the laes concentrated region reported by them are as follows : ( 1 ) diameter of the region is 25 mpc ( comoving unit ) , ( 2 ) projected overdensity of laes @xmath70 , ( 3 ) bias parameter is estimated 316 for @xmath0cdm model , and the best - fit value is @xmath71 , i.e.  @xmath72 . ( 4 ) the number of laes in the region is about 20 .",
    "properties from ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) are consistent with our numerical results of proto - cluster regions , if laes correspond to dark halos with mass more than @xmath7 , which is suggested by @xcite using correlation function on small - scales .",
    "the typical number of dark halos in the simulated proto - clusters is 510 , which is about half of that of observed laes .",
    "one explanation of this discrepancy is due to possibility that some dark halos have more than one laes .",
    "we speculate that some pairs of laes in fig .  3 of @xcite are included in the same dark halo .",
    "it is also possible that some of observed sample of laes in the region are low redshift interlopers .",
    "@xcite estimate the contamination of their sample to be about 20% .",
    "@xcite also reported properties of a laes rich region .",
    "the size of the region is @xmath73 14 @xmath11 10 mpc ( comoving unit ) .",
    "they estimate the region is overdense in laes by a factor of 15 compared with the blank field @xcite .",
    "the overdensity is much larger than that of proto - clusters at @xmath5 in our simulation and the size of their observed region is smaller than the typical size of the proto - clusters in our simulation .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the region observed by them is not a whole proto - cluster region , but the central region of the proto - cluster because of small size of the observed region and their high value of the overdensity .",
