    "the use of quantum channels to send classical information has many advantages over the use of classical channels .",
    "one of these is the fact that it enables one to establish cryptographic keys in a way that is provably secure , a feat which has never been achieved classically .",
    "developments such as this have led to renewed attention being given to the problem of distinguishing between quantum states@xcite . in state discrimination , we are faced with the following situation : a quantum system is prepared in one of @xmath0 states . for the sake of simplicity , we will take these to be pure states @xmath1 , where @xmath2 .",
    "the _ a priori _ probability of the state of the system being @xmath1 is @xmath3 .",
    "we would like to determine which state has been prepared . unless the states are orthogonal",
    "we can not determine the state perfectly .",
    "we are then faced with the problem of devising a strategy which discriminates between the @xmath0 potential states as well as possible .",
    "this will involve some , possibly generalised , quantum measurement .",
    "this measurement should be optimised and the resulting figure of merit , which is typically a probability , can be regarded as a measure of the distinguishability of the states with these _ a priori _ probabilities .",
    "a set of quantum states @xmath1 considered together with their _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath3 forms an ensemble @xmath4 .",
    "so , distinguishability measures will refer to ensembles .",
    "we shall denote a generic distinguishability measure by @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "several distinct measures are in common use for quantifying the distinguishability of states@xcite .",
    "the question we address in this paper is : do all distinguishability measures impose the same ordering on ensembles of @xmath0 quantum states ?",
    "that is , suppose that we have two ensembles , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and two distinguishability measures , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "then , if @xmath10>d_{1}[{\\cal e}_{2}]$ ] , is it the case that @xmath11{\\geq}d_{2}[{\\cal e}_{2}]$ ] ?",

    "the distinguishability measures we choose are the maximum probabilities of correct hypothesis testing and unambiguous state discrimination . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we restrict our attention to ensembles of states which have equal _ a priori _ probabilities .",
    "we show that for two equally - probable pure states , this effect can not be demonstrated for these distinguishability measures , which leads us to consider ensembles of @xmath12 states .",
    "we restrict our attention to linearly independent ensembles , since this is a requirement for unambiguous state discrimination@xcite .",
    "the states in the chosen ensembles are taken to form symmetrical sets .",
    "this is done to take advantage of the fact that for such ensembles , our distinguishability measures can be calculated analytically for equal _ a priori _ probabilities .",
    "the effect we have described is shown to occur for @xmath13 .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the connection between this effect and a related one recently discovered by jozsa and schlienz@xcite .",

    ", we consider an @xmath0 outcome generalised measurement , in which the @xmath15th outcome is associated with the povm element @xmath16 .",

    "this strategy will be the maximum probability @xmath25 of unambiguous determination of the state .    here",
    ", we will show that there exist ensemble pairs for which @xmath26 the effect we wish to demonstrate does not occur for an ensemble of just two equally - probable pure states .",
    "this can be seen by examining the values of @xmath18 and @xmath27 for a pair of pure states , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for later convenience",
    ", we will give expressions for these with arbitrary _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "also , the maximum value of @xmath27 for a pair of pure states is given by the jaeger - shimony bound@xcite @xmath34 when the a priori probabilities are equal , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . from this",
    ", one can show that @xmath18 is an increasing function of @xmath27 , implying that inequalities ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) can never be simultaneously satisfied .    to find ensembles of equally - probable pure states for which both ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) are true",
    ", we have to consider at least three states .",
    "we focus on ensembles of equally - probable , linearly independent , symmetrical states , since the maximum probabilities for unambiguous discrimination and correct hypothesis testing can be calculated explicitly for these .",
    "we will demonstrate the existence of ensemble pairs @xmath6 and @xmath7 which satisfy inequalities ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) , in the following way .",
    "firstly , we will consider _ all _ sets of @xmath0 linearly independent , symmetric states with equal _ a priori _ probabilities which have the same , arbitrary but fixed , value of @xmath27 . over this set , we will find the extremal values of @xmath18 .",
    "using this information , we choose ensembles pairs which satisfy inequality ( 2.3 ) , but where @xmath6 and @xmath7 have respectively the minimum and maximum values of @xmath18 for their corresponding values of @xmath27 .",
    "we will find that , for @xmath13 , inequality ( 2.4 ) is satisfied for a large range of parameters .",
    "the @xmath0 pure states @xmath1 , where @xmath37 , are linearly independent and symmetric if and only if they can be written as @xmath38 for some @xmath0 orthonormal states @xmath39 and non - zero complex coefficients @xmath40 satisfying @xmath41 . notice that the phase of @xmath40 may be absorbed by @xmath39 , which implies that we may , without loss of generality , take @xmath40 to be real and positive , which we shall .",
    "we will take all states to have equal _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath42 .",
    "the maximum unambiguous discrimination probability for these states is@xcite @xmath43 the optimum hypothesis testing strategy uses the so - called ` square - root ' measurement@xcite .",
    "define the operator @xmath44 and the states @xmath45 one can quite easily show that the operators @xmath46 form a povm ( i.e. , that @xmath47 and @xmath48 . )",
    "this povm is the optimal hypothesis testing strategy , and we find that @xmath49 the square - root measurement optimally discriminates between any set of equally - probable , symmetric states , even if they are not linearly independent",
    ". this measurement has recently been carried out@xcite for symmetrical optical polarisation states .",
    "applications of this measurement to quantum key distribution are discussed in@xcite .",
    "we now calculate the global extrema of @xmath18 for a fixed value of @xmath27 .",
    "our aim is to fix the smallest of the @xmath40 , which is equivalent to fixing @xmath27 , and vary the remaining coefficients to obtain the extremal values of @xmath18",
    ". we may let @xmath50 .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath51 for @xmath52 and some angles @xmath53 .",
    "we will now extremise @xmath18 with respect to these angles using the method of lagrange multipliers , in order to take into account the normalisation constraint .",
    "this method will yield the local extrema , over which we will subsequently optimise to find the global extrema .",
    "let @xmath54 .",
    "the constrained , local extrema of @xmath18 occur where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is our lagrange multiplier . inserting eq .",
    "( 2.12 ) into the definitions of @xmath18 and @xmath57 , we find that this becomes @xmath58=0.\\ ] ] it is a simple matter to show that the normalisation requirement will be violated if @xmath59 for any @xmath60 .",
    "so , for each @xmath60 , either @xmath61 , in which case @xmath62 , or the term in brackets is zero . to proceed , we will partition the @xmath40 into two sets , where each set corresponds to one of these two possibilities .",
    "let there be @xmath63 coefficients , including @xmath64 , which are equal to @xmath64 .",
    "for the remaining @xmath65 coefficients , the term in brackets is zero .",
    "all of the coefficients in this latter set must also be equal , as can be seen from the fact that the vanishing of the bracket term implies that the corresponding @xmath66 are equal .",
    "the value that they have is easily deduced from the fact that the other @xmath63 coefficients are equal to @xmath64 , and normalisation .",
    "we find they have the value @xmath67 we can now calculate the local extrema of @xmath18 .",
    "evaluating eq .",
    "( 2.11 ) where @xmath63 coefficients are equal to @xmath64 , with the remaining @xmath65 coefficients being given by eq . ( 2.15 ) , and making use of the fact that @xmath68 , we find that the local extrema of @xmath18 for fixed @xmath27 are @xmath69 finding the global extrema of @xmath18 amounts to extremisation of this expression with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "one method of doing this is to treat @xmath63 as a continuous parameter in the interval @xmath70 $ ] and differentiate eq .",
    "( 2.16 ) with respect to it . after some algebra , we find that @xmath71 , for @xmath18 given by eq .",
    "this implies that the global maximum and minimum of @xmath18 occur at the minimum and maximum values of @xmath63 respectively .",
    "thus , the maximum value of @xmath18 occurs at @xmath72 , which gives us the tight upper bound    @xmath73    for @xmath74 , we see that the maximum of @xmath18 is also equal to 1 . however , when @xmath75 , the maximum of @xmath18 is @xmath76 .",
    "[ 0.9 ] and @xmath77 of three linearly independent , equally - probable , symmetric states , versus the maximum unambiguous discrimination probability @xmath78 of @xmath6 and the parameter @xmath79 .",
    "this parameter is positive which implies that , except at the origin , inequality ( 2.3 ) is satisfied .",
    "inequality ( 2.4 ) is satisfied whenever the ratio @xmath80 , which , on this plot , corresponds to points lying above the fourth contour from the bottom.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we also see that the minimum value of @xmath18 occurs at @xmath81 , which gives us the tight lower bound @xmath82 when @xmath74 , the minimum of @xmath18 is also 1 , as we would expect .",
    "however , if @xmath75 , then the minimum of @xmath18 is @xmath83 , which corresponds to a random guess of which of the @xmath0 possible states the system has been prepared in . in fact , it is quite easily shown that in this case , all @xmath1 are , up to a phase , equal to @xmath84 . here",
    ", the states are linearly dependent and this case is of no interest to us in the present context .",
    "let us now use the bounds in ( 2.17 ) and ( 2.18 ) to demonstrate the existence of ensembles for which inequalities ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) hold .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will consider only ensembles for which @xmath13 .",
    "we will choose @xmath7 to be an ensemble which saturates the bound in ( 2.17 ) and @xmath6 to be one which saturates the bound in ( 2.18 ) , yet where @xmath85 , for some positive , non - zero parameter @xmath86 .",
    "this guarantees that inequality ( 2.3 ) is satisfied .",
    "figure 1 depicts @xmath87 as a function of @xmath78 and @xmath86 , where @xmath88 and @xmath13 .",
    "satisfaction of the inequality ( 2.4 ) occurs for parameters where @xmath89 , and a large range of such parameters in clearly visible in the figure .",
    "for example , let @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "this gives @xmath92 and inequality ( 2.3 ) is satisfied .",
    "evaluating the maximum correct hypothesis testing probabilities , we find that @xmath93 and @xmath94 which satisfies inequality ( 2.4 ) .",
    "we have seen that different distinguishability measures impose different orderings on ensembles of pure quantum states .",
    "we considered linearly independent states and demonstrated this effect using the maximum probabilities of correct hypothesis testing and unambiguous state discrimination as distiguishability measures .",
    "this result has important implications for any situation where we wish to transmit nonorthogonal states to send classical information .",
    "for example , in quantum key distribution , we may have a choice of sending states prepared in either ensemble @xmath95 or ensemble @xmath7 .",
    "the distinguishability of these ensembles may determine the potential information available to an eavesdropper and also the rate at which key bits can be generated .",
    "it would therefore be desirable to able to compare the distinguishability of both ensembles .",
    "what the results in the preceding show is that this can not be done in any absolute sense ; we must know in advance which distinguishability measure is being used .",
    "however , we may not know which measure would apply to a potential eavesdropper since we may not know in advance which detection strategy they would employ .    to put the results of the preceding section in context , it is helpful to consider a related finding recently made by jozsa and schlienz@xcite .",
    "they considered two ensembles of pure states , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with all states in each ensemble having equal _ a priori _ probabilities .",
    "they used the pairwise overlaps of pairs of states as a means of quantifying the distinguishability of each ensemble , and the von neumann entropy @xmath96 of the density operator of ensemble @xmath97 as a means of quantifying information content .",
    "they showed that there exist ensemble pairs in which the pairwise overlaps , and hence the distiguishability of @xmath7 are less than those of @xmath95 , yet where @xmath98 , implying that the information content of @xmath7 is greater than that of @xmath6 .",
    "this is somewhat counterintuitive , as information and distinguishability are often regarded as interchangeable concepts .",
    "this finding suggests that there are distinctions to be made between information and distinguishability .",
    "that they are not entirely interchangeable is perhaps suggested by the fact that they arise in different contexts . in attempting to distinguish between a set of states ,",
    "we are given only one copy , and must make optimum use of it . in information transmission however , we perform a collective measurement on a large number of states drawn from the same ensemble .",
    "the length of the strings and the subset chosen from the set of all possible strings is such that these strings are highly distinguishable .",
    "indeed , they are chosen in such a way that the probability of failing to distinguish between the states perfectly can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "the information content is the number of bits of classical information that can be transmitted per signal in each string , where the signals obey the statistical constraints of the ensemble . in information transmission , we select strings which are sufficiently long so that we can neglect the distinguishability issue in one way . however , it is possible that this issue does return in some form to dictate the information content of a single signal in ways that are not currently well - understood .",
    "a conclusive distinction , which does not apply to situations in which all states have the same _ a priori _ probabilities , is that information content and distinguishability can vary in opposite ways when the _ a priori _ probabilities of the states are altered . to illustrate this , consider two ensembles , @xmath95 and @xmath7 , where both consist of the pure states @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in @xmath95 , both states have equal _ a priori _ probabilities equal to 1/2 .",
    "however , in @xmath7 , they have unequal _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in state discrimination ,",
    "our goal is to determine the state .",
    "if one state is more probable than the other , then we can take advantage of this fact to tailor our measurement to weight it in favour of the state which has higher _ a priori _ probability , so that , on average , we will be able to improve our ability to determine the state .",
    "it follows that @xmath7 ought to have higher distinguishability than @xmath6 .",
    "this is made explicit if we look back at either the helstrom bound ( 2.5 ) or the jaeger - shimony bound ( 2.6 ) .",
    "these both increase as @xmath33 increases , confirming this expectation .",
    "however , if we wish to use states in ensemble @xmath7 to send messages , then the constraint that one state must always be more probable than the other implies that , to regain our freedom in the message we might choose to send , we must send more signal states per message as @xmath99 increases .",
    "quantitatively , for @xmath7 , the information content is given by the von neumann entropy of the ensemble density operator , which is equal to the binary entropy function @xmath100 where @xmath101 as @xmath99 increases , @xmath102 also increases which implies that , as can easily be shown , @xmath103 decreases .",
    "the extreme situation is where one of the _ a priori _ probabilities , say @xmath30 , is equal to 1 , in which case @xmath104 . here",
    ", we know in advance what the state is , and so we can always determine it perfectly .",
    "we may say that this ensemble has perfect distinguishability .",
    "however , the sender has no freedom in which state to send and the state is always entirely predictable .",
    "for this reason , it is impossible to transmit any information using this ensemble , for which @xmath103 is easily seen to be zero .",
    "as the above argument demonstrates , a clear distinction between information content and distinguishability emerges if variation of the _ a priori _ probabilities of the states is permitted .",
    "however , it is not entirely clear why they should be distinct concepts when the _ a priori _ probabilities of all states are equal .",
    "consequently , for ensembles with equal a priori probabilities , the observation that information and distinguishability impose different orderings remains to be properly understood .",
    "the results in this paper suggest a potential explanation of this phenomenon .",
    "given that it is not clear why information content should not be regarded as a distinguishability measure when we restrict our attention to ensembles of states with equal _ a priori _ probabilities , let us assume that it is in fact a suitable distinguishability measure under these circumstances .",
    "the jozsa - schlienz effect could then be explained as a demonstration of the fact that , even for ensembles of equally - probable states , different distinguishability measures impose different ensemble orderings , which is what we have shown in this paper , using quantities which are indisputably suitable distinguishability measures .",
    "it remains to be understood why different distinguishability measures impose different orderings .",
    "perhaps , for two distinguishability measures to be non - trivially distinct from one another , they must be sensitive to different aspects of ensembles of states , which can vary , with some degree of independence , from one ensemble to another .",
    "this seems reminiscent of the discovery recently made by virmani and plenio@xcite that different , good measures of the entanglement of mixed states must order these states differently .",
    "we have shown in this paper that two of the most common measures of the distinguishability of states , the maximum probabilities of correct hypothesis testing and unambiguous state discrimination , are essentially incompatible with each other . by this , we mean that they do not impose the same ordering on ensembles of pure states .",
    "it is possible to have one ensemble , @xmath6 , which is more distinguishable than another ensemble @xmath7 when the states must be distinguished unambiguously , yet where @xmath7 is more distinguishable than @xmath6 if we wish to identify the state by minimum error hypothesis testing . in general , we can not , in any absolute sense , characterise one ensemble of states as being more distinguishable than another .",
    "distinguishability comparison must necessarily refer to a particular discrimination strategy .    as with any interesting phenomenon ,",
    "it is important to determine the conditions under which this effect can be demonstrated optimally . here",
    ", we are faced with the fact that , for generic ensembles of states , the optimisation problems which must be solved to obtain values of distinguishability measures are difficult to tackle analytically . at the time of writing",
    ", the only ensembles for @xmath12 for which both of our chosen distinguishability measures can be calculated analytically are ensembles of equally - probable , linearly independent , symmetric pure states . for such ensembles , inequalities ( 2.16 ) and ( 2.17 )",
    "give the extremal values of the correct hypothesis testing probability for an fixed value of the maximum probability of unambiguous state discrimination , and so the optimal conditions for demonstrating this effect for these ensembles are given by these relations .",
    "we also explored in some detail the case of @xmath13 .",
    "the effect we have demonstrated is somewhat reminiscent of a related one recently discovered by jozsa and schlienz .",
    "these authors showed that one can construct an ensemble pair , @xmath105 , where the distinguishability of @xmath95 , as measured by the pairwise overlaps of states , is greater than that of @xmath7 , yet where the information content of @xmath7 , which is quantified by the von neumann entropy , is greater than that of @xmath6 .",
    "this is an important finding , not least because the concepts of distinguishability and information content are sometimes used interchangeably .",
    "we described how essential differences between these concepts do arise when , in moving from one ensemble to another , the a priori probabilities of the states are changed . however ,",
    "if the a priori probabilities of all states in both ensembles are the same , it is by no means clear that , despite the contrast between the asymptotic nature of information and the ` one shot ' nature of distinguishability , information measures can not also serve as measures of distinguishability .",
    "jozsa and schlienz demonstrated their effect using such ensembles .",
    "what the results in this paper suggest is a possible interpretation of the jozsa - schlienz effect .",
    "they showed that , for ensembles of equally - probable pure states , information and a particular distinguishability measure suffer an ordering incompatibility problem .",
    "does this imply that for such ensembles , information content is not a suitable distinguishability measure ?",
    "the results in this paper suggest that this is not necessarily the case , since different distinguishability measures suffer analogous ordering problems .",
    "it could then be the case that , for the ensembles considered by jozsa and schlienz , information content is in fact a suitable distinguishability measure and that the ordering incompatibility they discovered is a consequence of the fact that such problems arise with regard to generic distinguishbility measures .",
