    "with the advent of wide field surveys our knowledge of galaxy properties has significantly improved .",
    "the large amount of high quality data of nearby and high redshift objects obtained so far is allowing astronomers to shed light on how galaxies formed and evolved at different redshifts and in different environments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however our picture of the universe still remains limited since it is mostly based on the study of rest - frame optical selected objects .",
    "first of all optically - selected galaxies already contain , by definition , a large amount of stars which may not be the case in younger or less evolved galaxies .",
    "secondly , surface brightness selection is very dramatic and nearly all catalogued objects lie in an extremely narrow range of surface brightnesses @xcite .",
    "+ since each wavelength has its own selection effects and traces different baryonic components , the combination of blind surveys at various frequencies is of vital importance .",
    "alternative methods of baryon selection will allow us to have a less biased view of our universe and enable us to correctly reconstruct the evolutionary history of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the most interesting results can come from the comparison of optical surveys with blind surveys tracing components not directly related to stellar emission like , for example , neutral and molecular hydrogen . for molecular hydrogen we will have to wait a couple of years for the first results from alma , but with the advent of multi - beam instruments on large single dish radio telescopes it has become possible during the last decade to carry out fully sampled blind hi surveys of the sky ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "neutral hydrogen is extremely important because it represents the fuel for the future star formation activity of a galaxy .",
    "it is also one of the galactic components that can most easily be affected by environmental mechanism ( e.g. ram pressure , tidal interaction ) influencing its star formation history",
    ". therefore hi line observations of galaxies can provide us with some of the most powerful diagnostics on the role of the environment in regulating the evolution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "what we lack is deep and high spatial resolution hi blind surveys of cluster of galaxies and their outskirts .",
    "the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) has represented a real breakthrough for hi blind surveys , but its low spatial resolution ( @xmath115 arcmin ) has made it very difficult to carry out detailed studies of high density regions .",
    "fortunately , with the refurbishing of the 305 m arecibo radio telescope , blind hi surveys with much improved sensitivity , spatial ( 3.5 arcmin @xmath2 ) and velocity ( 5 @xmath3 ) resolution have become possible thanks to the installation of the alfa multi beam instrument .",
    "the abell cluster 1367 , due to its proximity ( z@xmath10.0216 , v@xmath16500 ) and to the fact that it is currently forming at the intersection of two filaments in the great wall @xcite , represents an ideal target for hi surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is ideal for the study of the properties of hi selected galaxies and environmental effects . for these reasons ,",
    "abell 1367 is one of the region observed as a part of the arecibo galaxy environment survey ( ages , @xcite ) , one of the new hi blind survey carried out with the alfa multi - beam system .",
    "ages aims to study the atomic hydrogen properties of different galactic environments to faint sensitivity limits ; low hi masses ( 6@xmath4 , assuming a 200 velocity width at 92.8 mpc , the distance of the a1367 cluster ) and column densities of @xmath1 3@xmath5 ( for a source that fills the beam ) . the environments ages will survey range from apparent voids in the large - scale structure of galaxies , via isolated spiral galaxies and their haloes , to galaxy - rich regions associated with galaxy clusters and filamentary structures .",
    "ages plans to cover @xmath6 square degrees centered on abell 1367 . here",
    "we report on the early results obtained from observations of a subset of the whole ages - a1367 region : a @xmath7 square degree area centered on the cluster core .",
    "as part of the ages , we observed the abell 1367 region in may 2006 and april 2007 using the alfa feed array at the 305-m arecibo telescope .",
    "a total of @xmath163 hours observing time were allocated with an average observing time of @xmath12.3 hours per night . since the allocated time was insufficient to cover all the ages - a1367 region ( 5@xmath04 square degrees ) we decided to give the highest priority to the cluster center and its immediate outskirts covering a strip of @xmath15@xmath01 square degrees ( 11:34:00@xmath8r.a.(j.2000)@xmath811:54:15 , 19:15@xmath8dec(j.2000)@xmath820:20 ) centered on the cluster core .",
    "the observation and data reduction techniques adopted by ages are extensively described in @xcite ; here we will only provide a brief summary of them .",
    "+ ages uses the 7-feed alfa multi - beam receiver and a spectral line backend capable of instantaneously recording spectra from the two linear polarizations of each beam and covering a bandwidth of 100 mhz .",
    "the angular resolution is given by the size of the alfa beams ( @xmath13.3@xmath03.8 arcmin ) and the velocity resolution is @xmath125khz , corresponding to @xmath1 5.5 .",
    "observations are performed in _ drift scan mode _ ( e.g. @xcite ) : the array is kept at a fixed azimuth and elevation while the sky drifts overhead .",
    "the earth s rotation rate governs the on source time in a drift scan . for arecibo",
    "this means that each point in the sky takes @xmath112 s to cross the beam .",
    "twenty - five separate scans are then required to reach the 300 s / beam integration time . in order to compensate for the change in parallactic angle , and thus achieve uniform sky coverage",
    ", alfa must be rotated before every scan and , in order to attain fully sampled sky coverage , it is necessary to stagger the declination ( dec . ) of individual scans by @xmath11 arcmin ( half the beam separation ) .",
    "we record data every second and total power values for each of the seven beams , both polarizations and 4096 channels , are recorded as four - bit floating point numbers .",
    "calibration is performed at the beginning of every scan using a high - temperature noise diode that is injected into each beam for a duration of 1 s. a uniform final depth of @xmath1 300 sec was achieved for all of the area observed .",
    "data reduction was performed using the aips++ packages livedata and gridzilla @xcite , developed by the australian telescope national facility ( atnf ) .",
    "livedata performs bandpass estimation and removal , doppler tracking and calibrates the residual spectrum .",
    "gridzilla is a gridding package that co - adds all the spectra using a suitable algorithm , to produce 3d data cubes .",
    "the abell 1367 5@xmath01 square degrees region was gridded using a median gridding technique into 1@xmath01 square arcmin pixels , each of which contains a 4096 channel spectrum , and was smoothed at a velocity resolution of 10 .",
    "the ages observing strategy is highly successful at reducing sidelobe variations by making a nyquist - sampled map with every alfa beam individually .",
    "thus , when the observations are median combined , the variations across the beams are removed , leaving a circular beam with symmetrical sidelobes at a @xmath15 - 10% level @xcite .",
    "the output data cube has two spatial dimensions and the spectral dimension can be chosen by the user to be frequency , wavelength or velocity .",
    "the noise distribution is fairly gaussian with a standard deviation of 0.8439@xmath90.0003 mjy , consistent with the expected value @xcite for minimal smoothing of the beam .",
    "the cube is publicly available and can be downloaded at the following link @xmath10 .",
    "radio frequency interference ( rfi ) represents a constant source of contamination in certain regions of the observed spectral window .",
    "in particular two main rfi sources were present in all the scans : the san juan faa radar at 1350 mhz and its 3rd harmonic at 1387.8 mhz .",
    "in addition an intermittent source of rfi ( gps satellite l3 ) appeared only in some of the scans at approximately 1381 mhz .",
    "the strong constant sources at 1350 mhz ( v@xmath114620@xmath9140 ) and 1387.8 mhz ( v@xmath17009@xmath919 ) completely obscure a part of the cosmic volume : in particular the 1387.8 mhz rfi lies approximately at the velocity of abell 1367 making part of the cluster volume inaccessible .",
    "the intermittent gps source at 1381 mhz ( v@xmath18500 ) reduces our sensitivity limit and could significantly influence the number of sources detected in a frequency range @xmath1 300 wide .",
    "in addition to the rfi another two sources of contamination affect our data . the first one is the galaxy : livedata is not able to correctly subtract the strong emission from the milky way , resulting in a blindness of our survey in about the velocity range -50@xmath11 + 50 .",
    "moreover the abell 1367 region includes the 3c264 radio galaxy ( r.a.=11:45:05.5 , dec=+19:36:23 ) .",
    "this strong radio source has a 1.4ghz continuum flux of @xmath15 jy , producing strong spectral standing waves and making a @xmath14 arcmin radius region around the galaxy inaccessible .      in every blind survey a crucial step in the data reduction is represented by the source extraction .",
    "the objective is to obtain a catalogue of confirmed sources to well defined selection limits : as the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) decreases , the contamination by spurious noise signals quickly rises .",
    "detection techniques need to be optimized to discriminate real from spurious signals as well as possible .",
    "currently source extraction is carried out using three different methods : the cube is visually inspected independently by two of us ( in this case rra and lc ) and by an automatic extractor ( polyfind , written by r. f. minchin ) based on a peak flux threshold . the automatic extractor is essentially based on the cross - correlation with templates method described by @xcite .",
    "the program initially looks for peak values above a pre - defined value ( in this case 4@xmath12 ) and then cross - correlates with templates accepting the best fit as long as the correlation coefficient is above 0.75 and the total signal - to - noise ratio of the detection is above 4 @xcite .",
    "automatically extracted candidates are then checked by eye , visually inspecting the full ages spectrum summed from a 5@xmath13 box around the position of the detection .",
    "the aim of this process is to quickly remove obvious spurious detections while not rejecting any real source .",
    "these methods provided a list of 104 candidate hi sources 210 .",
    "these systems are described in the appendix of this paper .",
    "] , of which 78 were detected by all the three different signal extraction techniques . in the following",
    "we will refer to these 78 objects as `` sure '' sources and to the remaining 26 as `` possible '' sources .",
    "the distribution of the total 21 cm flux as a function of the line width at the 50% level of peak maximum for our 104 candidate sources is shown in fig.[ftotw ] .",
    "filled circles indicate `` sure '' sources while empty circles are `` possible '' sources .",
    "the void in the bottom right part of the plot ( i.e. large velocity widths and small fluxes ) is due to a selection effect present in the source extraction technique : at fixed low total flux it is easier to detect a narrow hi source , since the survey is not flux but surface brightness limited . in order to compare the ages s / n threshold with the recent results presented by alfalfa @xcite we plotted in fig.[ftotw ] a s / n limit of @xmath14=6.5 for our survey , where @xcite : @xmath15 @xmath16 is the total flux in jy",
    ", @xmath17 is the velocity width measured at the 50% level , @xmath18 is either @xmath19 for @xmath20 or 400/@xmath21 for @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the spectral velocity resolution and @xmath24 is the r.m.s .",
    "noise across the spectrum measured in mjy at @xmath25 spectral resolution . in our case @xmath25=10 .",
    "the great majority of our `` sure '' sources lie well above @xmath14=6.5 while the `` possible '' sources have @xmath266.5 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "this suggests that also for our sample @xmath14=6.5 is a reliable threshold for discriminating between `` sure '' and `` possible '' sources .",
    "in order to test the reliability of our extraction technique and the real nature of the 26 `` possible '' sources , 10 hours of telescope time where scheduled with the arecibo single pixel l - band wide ( lbw ) receiver in april 2007 .",
    "the lbw observations were made covering a spectral band of 12.5 mhz ( 2048 spectral channels ) centered at the expected source recessional velocity .",
    "the integration time varied between 5 and 10 minutes depending on the intensity of the source , reaching an rms in the range @xmath10.5 - 0.8 mjy beam@xmath27 at a velocity resolution of 10 km s@xmath27 .",
    "all observations were taken using the position - switching technique , with each blank sky ( or off ) position observed for the same duration , and over the same portion of the telescope dish ( az and el ) as the on - source ( on ) observation .",
    "each 5 min + 5 min on + off pair was followed by a 10 s on + off observation of a calibrated noise diode . none of the 26 observed sources lies within the sidelobes of a `` sure '' hi detection , making unlikely a sidelobe contamination of the l - wide follow - up observations . of the 26 `` possible '' sources , only 4 ( indicated with crosses in fig.[ftotw ] ) were not confirmed by arecibo follow - up observations .",
    "we therefore have a sample of 100 sure hi sources detected in the 5@xmath01 square degrees observed by ages in the abell 1367 region .",
    "all the 100 sources in the sample were inspected and parametrized using the miriad task mbspect @xcite .",
    "the source position was estimated from a gaussian fit to the moment map within the galaxy velocity range and the spectrum was then extracted from the data cubes .",
    "this spectrum is a weighted average , with the weight depending on the distance of each pixel from the fitted position .",
    "velocity widths were then measured at the 20% and 50% levels ( @xmath28 and @xmath17 ) relative to the peak signal , using a width - maximizing algorithm @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in each derived quantity are computed following the recipes given by @xcite . in table",

    "the results of the lbw follow - up observations are presented in table [ lwidetab ] , which lists the following : + col.1 : hi source i d + col.2 : heliocentric velocity and relative error of the source ( @xmath29 ) , measured as the midpoint between the channels at which the flux density drops to 50% .",

    "although these are the lowest s / n sources within our sample , the agreement between the dataset is quite good with an average dispersion of 19 in recessional velocity , 35 in velocity width and @xmath114% in total flux .",
    "the coma - a1367 supercluster is one of the regions most intensively investigated by optically selected hi surveys ( i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "however only 21 out of the 100 sources detected by ages had a previous hi measurement .",
    "the high number of new hi detections in ages ( @xmath179% ) confirms once more the importance of hi blind surveys for having an unbiased view of the neutral hydrogen distribution in the local universe . among the 21 sources previously known @xcite ,",
    "three of these objects ( namely cgcg97 - 079 , cgcg97 - 087 and cgcg127 - 052 ) are strongly contaminated by rfis in the ages cube , and can not be used for a comparison with the literature .",
    "our measurements for the remaining 18 objects are in satisfactory agreement with past works as illustrated in fig.[lwide ] ( empty circles ) .",
    "there is quite a good agreement in both fluxes and velocity width measurements and the average scatter is @xmath110% in flux and @xmath1 28 in velocity width . in one case ( cgcg97 - 138 ) our velocity width estimate differs considerably from literature values : @xcite gives a velocity width of 160whereas we measure only 62 ) .",
    "however our new l - wide measurement is consistent with the value obtained from the ages cube ( w=58 ) .",
    "the abell 1367 region has been covered in the optical by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) as part of data release 5 .",
    "we have used this homogenous dataset to look for optical counterparts of our hi sources .",
    "we cross - correlated our list of hi detections with the sdss galaxy catalogue using a search radius of 4 arcmin . in the few cases",
    "in which no candidate optical counterpart was found , we visually inspected the sdss plates to look for low surface brightness galaxies not included in the sdss catalogue .",
    "once a candidate optical counterpart was found , we looked into the literature and ned for an estimate of its optical recessional velocity .",
    "in addition for 5 of the 46 candidates without an available redshift in the literature we obtained new optical recessional velocity estimates in january - febrary 2007 using the imaging spectrograph bfosc attached to the cassini 1.5 m telescope at loiano ( italy ) .",
    "observations and data reduction techniques applied are described in @xcite .    confirmed optical counterparts are defined as those optical galaxies lying within 4 arcmin and having a recessional velocity within @xmath9200 from the radio velocity .",
    "candidate optical counterparts are galaxies which lie within 4 arcmin but do not have a published optical recessional velocity . of the 100 hi sources in our sample ,",
    "55 have confirmed optical counterparts , 34 have a unique candidate ( i.e. no optical recessional velocity available ) optical counterpart , 7 have two or more candidate counterparts and 4 sources appear to have no optical counterparts .",
    "three of these objects are associated with the interacting groups in the outskirts of abell 1367 described in the appendix of this paper .",
    "a list of the optical counterparts ( confirmed and candidate ) associated with the hi sources is presented in table [ optcounttab ] .    in fig.[centroid",
    "] we show the distribution of the difference between the optical and hi positions and recessional velocities for the 55 sources having confirmed optical counterparts .",
    "optical and radio measurements show a very good agreement with a median offset of only 18 arcsec in position ( consistent with the typical error of 16 arcsec in the estimate of the centroid for radio sources ) and of @xmath14@xmath916 in recessional velocity .    for all the hi sources having 1 optical counterpart ( confirmed or candidate ) we downloaded sdss - dr5 @xmath30 images @xcite and performed aperture photometry and surface brightness profile decomposition using the task _ ellipse _ within iraf .",
    "the radial profiles have been constructed by integrating the available images within elliptical , concentric annuli .",
    "the ellipticity and position angles have been determined and then fixed using the @xmath31 band image .",
    "total magnitudes , effective radii ( @xmath32 ) and effective surface brightness ( @xmath33 , i.e. average surface brightness within @xmath32 ) have been determined following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "fig.[distrall ] illustrates the sky ( upper panel ) and the hi mass vs distance distributions ( lower panel ) for all the 100 sources detected in the a1367 cube . over half of the sources ( 54 )",
    "belongs to the abell 1367 cluster and its outskirts , lying in the velocity range 4000@xmath119000 .",
    "this roughly explains why in this cube we detect twice the number of sources than in other ages fields : excluding the abell 1367 region ( 4000@xmath119000 ) we are left with 46 sources consistent with the number found in ngc628 @xcite , ngc1156 ( auld et al . in prep . ) and ngc7332 @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel of fig.[distrall ] allows a direct comparison of ages with alfalfa @xcite showing that , in the same area of sky , alfalfa would miss @xmath1 half of the sources detected here .",
    "this is quite expected since alfalfa has an integration time @xmath1 6.3 times shorter ( @xmath148 sec instead of @xmath1300 sec ) than ages .",
    "more impressive is the difference between ages and the northern hipass extension @xcite : whereas ages finds 100 sources , hipass does not detect a single galaxy in the 5@xmath01 square degrees here studied .",
    "we use the hi data from ages and the optical data from sdss to derive the physical properties of our sample .",
    "the hi mass ( @xmath34 ) is defined as : @xmath35 where @xmath16 is the integrated hi flux in jy and d is the galaxy distance in mpc . for those galaxies belonging to abell 1367 ( 4000@xmath119000 )",
    "we assume @xmath36=92.8 mpc @xcite while we assume @xmath37 with @xmath38 70 @xmath39 for the rest of the sample .",
    "the stellar mass is obtained from the optical colors and luminosity as defined in @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the absolute magnitude in the @xmath31 band .",
    "therefore the total amount of baryons is @xmath42=@xmath43+@xmath34 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this quantity does not include the contribution of helium and metals ( usually assumed equal to 1.4@xmath0m(hi ) ) , the molecular hydrogen and any warm or hot gas component .",
    "therefore @xmath42 must be considered as a lower limit of the real value .",
    "finally we define the galaxy dynamical mass as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the gravitational constant , @xmath46 is the radius containing 75% of the @xmath31 band flux , @xmath47 is the hi velocity width ( here we use the average between @xmath17 and @xmath28 hi velocity widths ) corrected for inclination and @xmath48 is the ratio between @xmath46 and the extension of the hi emission ( i.e. @xmath49 ) .",
    "@xmath48 should lie between 2 - 3 @xcite , but for our galaxies radio interferometric data ( necessary to estimate @xmath50 ) is not available , so this remains unknown and we leave it as a free parameter .",
    "the galaxy inclination is obtained from the ellipticity determined in the @xmath31 band via : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the galaxy ellipticity and @xmath53 is the intrinsic axial ratio of the galaxy here assumed equal to 0.13 @xcite .",
    "we excluded from this analysis face - on galaxies having @xmath54 ( 20 galaxies ) , for which it is not possible to accurately estimate the dynamical mass .",
    "the correlations between different optical and hi quantities and their distributions for our sample are presented in fig.[paramall ] . from left to right : the ratio of the gas to stellar mass , the baryon fraction ( @xmath55 ) , the total hi mass , the effective surface brightness in @xmath31 band , the @xmath56 color and the dynamical mass are presented .",
    "only galaxies with one optical counterpart and @xmath54 ( 69 galaxies ) are shown : filled dots are objects with confirmed optical counterparts while empty dots indicate objects with optical counterpart candidates .",
    "our sample covers almost three orders of magnitude in both hi and dynamical mass .",
    "the optical surface brightness distribution shows a significant tail at low surface brightness ( @xmath5722.5 - 24 mag @xmath58 ) as usually observed in hi selected sample ( e.g. @xcite ) . hi",
    "selected samples are often considered as composed of only blue , gas - rich galaxies .",
    "this is not the case for our sample which spans over 1 magnitude in the @xmath56 color , as is typically observed in optically selected samples @xcite , and covers a wide range of gas to stars ratios ( @xmath59 ) : from gas poor objects ( @xmath60 0.1 ) to extremely gas rich galaxies ( @xmath60 10 ) .",
    "more massive galaxies appear to be redder , have higher surface brightness and lower gas content than dwarf systems .",
    "this is also found to be the case in optically selected samples @xcite .",
    "well known relations like color - mass , surface brightness - mass and hydrogen - dynamical mass are here rediscovered .",
    "unfortunately the small number of objects in our sample does not allow a more detailed comparison between the slopes , scatters and distributions of the relations followed by hi and optically selected galaxies .",
    "we postpone this kind of analysis to the moment when we will have a significantly large ages database at our disposition .",
    "+ the most intriguing result presented in fig.[paramall ] is the absence of any correlation involving the baryon fraction . on the contrary all galaxies in our sample appear to have almost the same baryon fraction @xmath61=(-0.2-log(@xmath48))@xmath90.13 independently from their mass , surface brightness or gas content .",
    "the little dispersion in the baryon fraction distribution is in fact well within the observational errors .",
    "assuming 0.1 dex error in the hi mass ( see sec.4.1 ) , in the stellar mass @xcite and in the dynamical mass , the uncertainty on the estimate of the baryon fraction is @xmath10.17 dex .",
    "the gas and stellar mass fraction cover a larger dynamical range ( i.e. have a larger dispersion : @xmath62=(-0.4-log(@xmath48))@xmath90.24 and @xmath63=(-0.6-log(@xmath48))@xmath90.3 ) ) than the baryon fraction , as shown in fig.[massratios ] and accordingly to the kolmogorov - smirnov test the baryon fraction distribution is not compatible with the gas and star fraction distributions at a 99.99% confidence level .",
    "we can therefore conclude that our sample shows approximately the same baryon fraction .",
    "a constant baryonic mass fraction in galaxies implies a direct correlation between dynamical mass and baryonic mass : exactly what is usually required for the tully - fisher relation @xcite .",
    "this result is also consistent with the recent study of an optically selected sample of extremely low mass dwarf galaxies carried out by @xcite . to our knowledge , this is the first confirmation of a constant baryonic fraction coming from an hi selected sample .",
    "this observational evidence is also consistent with models of galaxy formation @xcite but in contradiction with recent models of galaxy evolution which invoke supernova feedback and other physical mechanisms to remove baryons preferentially from low mass systems and to reproduce the observed scaling relations @xcite .",
    "even if our sample includes low surface brightness galaxies it appears that physical mechanisms that preferentially remove baryons from low mass galaxies are not effective in the mass range and selection criteria of our sample .",
    "we remark that the only way to obtain a correlation between the baryon fraction and the dynamical mass in our sample would be to assume that @xmath48 ( i.e. the ratio of the hi to optical radius ) is a strong function of the mass and/or the contribution of molecular hydrogen , hot and warm gas to the total baryon mass varies with the mass of the galaxy .",
    "we can not a priori exclude the first possibility , even if unlikely since @xcite found that the ratio of the hi to optical radius varies by only 20% along the hubble sequence .",
    "conversely , the molecular hydrogen represents only @xmath115% of the total gas reservoir in normal , late - type galaxies @xcite and the contribution of hot and warm gas components is a few percents ( @xmath641 - 2% ) of the total gas mass ( e.g. @xcite ) making the second scenario extremely unlikely .",
    "more than half of the hi sources detected in the cube belong to the abell 1367 volume .",
    "this includes not only the cluster core but also a part of the great wall : a large scale filament of galaxies connecting abell 1367 to the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "all galaxies in the filament lie approximately at the same distance from us as abell 1367 , implying that the system a1367+great wall constitutes a volume limited sample . at the distance of abell 1367 ( @xmath192.8 mpc )",
    "the surveyed sky area has a physical size of 8.1@xmath01.6 @xmath65 and our sensitivity limit for a source with @xmath17=200 is @xmath16@xmath4 .",
    "since the virial radius of abell 1367 is @xmath1 2.3 mpc @xcite , our region covers the cluster virialized region and its immediate neighborhood .    in order to compare the hi and optical properties of the abell 1367 region we extracted an optically selected sample of galaxies from sdss - dr5 .",
    "we select all galaxies in the ages region having @xmath66 mag ( corresponding to @xmath67 at the abell 1367 distance ) : 259 galaxies in total , of which 208 have optical redshift available and 155 are confirmed cluster members ( 4000@xmath119000 ) .",
    "we note that the time necessary to carry out a hi targeted survey of this optically selected sample ( reaching the same ages noise level ) would be similar to the observing time needed by ages to cover all the 5@xmath01 square degrees in abell 1367 .",
    "the sky distribution of the 54 hi sources belonging to the a1367 region ( 4000@xmath119000 ) is shown in fig.[skya1367 ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that no significant over - density of sources is observed corresponding to the cluster center : the only hi galaxy lying well within the x - ray cluster contours belongs to a small group of galaxies infalling for the first time into the cluster , suggesting that it is just entering the cluster and it is only projected on the center of abell 1367 @xcite .",
    "this appears much more evident when we compare the sky distribution of our sample with the typical sky distribution obtained for the optically selected sample . in fig.[skya1367 ] we show the distribution of the 155 confirmed cluster members ( empty circles ) and of the 51 galaxies without redshift available mag , suggesting that a not negligible fraction is composed by background galaxies @xcite . ]",
    "( empty stars ) extracted from the optically selected sample .",
    "the optical selected sample is strongly clustered on the cluster center and almost half of the sources detected lie within the x - ray emitting region .",
    "moreover the `` finger of god '' feature , typical of clusters of galaxies , is not observed in the hi selected sample ( see fig.[wedge ] ) .",
    "conversely the hi - selected galaxies show a different pattern in the wedge diagram shown in fig.[wedge ] : galaxies on the east side of the cluster have a lower recessional velocity than galaxies in the west side .",
    "this probably suggests the presence of two different infalling directions into the cluster core as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the differences observed between the optically and hi selected samples are somehow expected since clusters of galaxies are made hi deficient structures through the combination of the morphology - density relation @xcite and of the `` gas - density '' relation @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with recent determinations of the correlation function for hi selected samples @xcite which show that hi galaxies are among the least clustered objects in the universe .",
    "the influence of the harsh cluster environment is barely visible when we look for radial variations of the gas to star mass ratio and of the hi - deficiency ( see fig.[defradius ] ) .",
    "the hi deficiency is defined as the difference , in logarithmic units , between the observed hi mass and the value expected from an isolated galaxy with the same morphological type t and optical linear diameter d : hi def = @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "we used the equations in @xcite to calculate the expected hi mass from the optical diameter .",
    "the hi deficiency does not significant vary with the cluster - centric distance ( fig.[defradius ] , bottom panel ) , contrary to what usually observed in optically selected samples ( i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "a slight decrease on the average value of the gas to star mass ratio is observed in correspondence of the cluster center , however also in this case no strong gradients have been found .",
    "we can therefore conclude that when observed in hi the abell cluster 1367 almost completely disappears and the only evidence of its hidden presence is a slightly higher number of galaxies with a low gas to star mass ratio near the cluster core .",
    "the abell 1367 local volume can be used for a more detailed analysis of selection effects representing a unique dataset for which complete samples independently selected at optical and radio wavelengths are available .",
    "we are particularly interested in the comparison of the hi mass distribution and optical luminosity function estimated from the two samples . in the past",
    ", different authors have used optically selected samples to determine the hi mass distributions of galaxies in the local universe obtaining results significantly different from radio selected samples @xcite .",
    "we therefore used the optically selected sample extracted from sdss - dr5 , complete to @xmath66 mag , in order to compare the hi distribution and the @xmath69 band luminosity function for optically and hi selected galaxies .",
    "contrary to the hi selected sample , the sdss sample is not complete in redshift , but the redshift completeness rapidly drops below 50% for @xmath70 mag ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "this complicates the estimate of the luminosity function at low luminosities . in order to overcome",
    "the redshift incompleteness of cluster samples we used the _ completeness corrected _ method proposed by @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the assumption that the spectroscopic sample ( i.e. galaxies with redshift available ) is representative of the entire cluster , i.e. the fraction of galaxies that are cluster members is the same in the ( incomplete ) spectroscopic sample as in the ( complete ) photometric one .",
    "the hi mass distributions obtained from the optically and hi selected samples are shown in fig.[lfhi ] .",
    "as expected the two samples produce hi distributions significantly different .",
    "the optical selected sample drops quicker at low hi masses and does not include nearly half of the hi sources in the a1367 volume .",
    "the two samples start to differ at @xmath722@xmath73 , well before our sensitivity limit .",
    "low luminosity , low surface brightness , gas rich objects are in fact not included in the optical sample , but they represent a significant fraction of the total hi budget in abell 1367 . this result is consistent with the recent work by @xcite who showed that the faint end slope of the hi mass function for an optically selected sample is less steep than the one obtained from a 21 cm selected sample .",
    "our analysis suggests that this difference is mainly due to selection effects and that hi distributions obtained from optically selected samples can not be generally considered as good proxies of the hi mass function in the local universe .",
    "the hi and optically selected samples also differ in the estimate of the optical luminosity functions ( fig.[lfopt ] , lower panel ) .",
    "the luminosity function ( lf ) for the hi selected galaxies is flatter and includes fewer objects ( i.e. lower @xmath74 ) than the one obtained from the optically selected sample .",
    "a great part of this difference is due to the overabundance of red ( @xmath750.9 ) , gas poor galaxies in the center of abell 1367 : more than 80% of bright red galaxies ( @xmath76 ) in the a1367 region are not detected at 21 cm ( see fig.[lfopt ] , upper panel ) .",
    "the difference between the two samples is less evident if we compare the luminosity functions obtained only for blue galaxies ( fig.[lfopt ] , middle panel ) , but even in this case the hi sample misses @xmath130% of blue cluster galaxies .",
    "this result is quite interesting since we generally associate hi deficiency to red colors . in order to further investigate the properties of these blue galaxies",
    "not detected in hi , in fig.[colmag ] we compare the color @xmath56 , @xmath31 magnitude relation for the confirmed cluster members in the optically ( empty circles ) and hi selected ( triangles ) samples .",
    "almost all the hi galaxies lie on the blue sequence , but the opposite is not true : not all the galaxies in the blue sequence are detected in hi",
    ". this could be due to a number of different reasons .",
    "first of all we have to take into account our sensitivity limit ( @xmath726@xmath4 for w@xmath77 @xmath1 200 ) which we need to relate to optical color and magnitude . to do",
    "so we have used the correlation between the hi mass and @xmath31 band luminosity ratio and the @xmath56 color observed for our sample .",
    "the best bisector linear fitting gives the following relation : @xmath78 with a dispersion of 0.37 dex .",
    "we can use this equation to estimate our sensitivity limit , which is indicated by the solid line in fig.[colmag ] .",
    "we consider undetected blue galaxies those objects not detected by ages , lying outside the one @xmath12 region and with a @xmath56 color bluer than 0.9 mag : 10 galaxies in total . some of these sources lie within ( in both space and velocity ) strong hi galaxies and can be missed , due to the size of the arecibo beam ( fwhm@xmath13.5 arcmin ) and to the fact that in these cases the hi emission is totally assigned to the bright source .",
    "moreover some galaxies have a recessional velocity within the rfis frequencies and can not be detected . excluding these cases ( indicated with crosses in fig.[colmag ] , left )",
    "we are left with eight blue galaxies which are not detected in hi .",
    "these objects have a @xmath69 band luminosity in the range 2@xmath010@xmath79 10@xmath80 l@xmath81 ( i.e. -19.4@xmath82 - 17.9 mag ) , implying that we are dealing with intermediate mass galaxies and not dwarf systems .",
    "moreover their broad - band morphology and structural parameters are indistinguishable from the other blue hi detected galaxies .",
    "the limits obtained from eq.[ml ] imply that the undetected galaxies have a hi deficiency @xmath830.37 , suggesting that we are dealing with blue , deficient objects , consistent with the marginal detection of two of these galaxies ( cgcg97 - 092 , cgcg97 - 093 ) by deeper surveys @xcite implying an hi deficiency 0.31 and 0.57 respectively .",
    "this suggests that we are dealing with the same population of hi poor , star forming spirals originally observed in nearby clusters by @xcite .",
    "only when observed in h@xmath84 emission of a galaxy is due to the hydrogen ionized in hii regions by massive ( @xmath8510 m@xmath81 ) , young ( @xmath8 2 @xmath0 10@xmath86 yr ) stars . ]",
    "these galaxies appear different from healthy spirals , showing a truncation of the star forming disk .",
    "in particular , in all but one object for which h@xmath84 data are available ( 8 galaxies , @xcite ) the h@xmath84 radius ( e.g. the isophotal radius within @xmath87 ) is @xmath12 - 4 times less extended than the @xmath88 band 24th mag @xmath58 isophotal radius ( see table [ nodettab ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with various independent studies @xcite which have shown that the hi deficiency is associated with a truncation of the star forming disk .",
    "all the deficient objects lie at a projected distance of less than @xmath11 degree from the center of abell 1367 , suggesting that the absence of hi and the truncation of the star formation disk is likely due to their interaction with the cluster environment .",
    "the fact that these objects have lost almost 40% of their original gas content but their broadband morphology and optical colours are still those typical of normal star forming spirals implies that they are recent arrivals within the cluster environment .",
    "it appears that the neutral hydrogen has been already stripped well within the optical radius quenching the star formation in the galaxy outskirts , but a type stars have not yet died and the galaxies still appear as blue as they were before losing their gas .",
    "given that h@xmath84 traces stars younger than @xmath89 yr and the typical lifetime of a stars is @xmath11 gyr , we can speculate that our galaxies started to loose their gas @xmath1100myr ago , in agreement with the typical timescale for gas stripping observed in virgo cluster galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) and predicted by numerical models ( e.g. @xcite ) . in less than 1 gyr , when all the a stars are dead , these objects will lie in the @xmath56 red sequence and will not be any different from the bulk of the gas - poor ( red ) galaxy cluster population .",
    "only future detailed spectroscopic investigation will allow us the better estimate the time scale of this transformation .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that this population of blue gas - poor galaxies corresponds to @xmath1 one third of the whole population of blue galaxies in the a1367-volume , supporting the idea that a1367 is a cluster still young and a considerable number of objects are infalling into the cluster core for the first time @xcite .",
    "we have presented the results of a hi blind survey of 5@xmath01 square degrees centered on the core of abell 1367 as part of the arecibo galaxy environment survey .",
    "one hundred hi galaxies have been detected ( 79 new measurements and 50 new redshifts ) , half of which belong to the abell 1367 volume . comparing the properties of the hi selected galaxies with an optically selected sample extracted from sdss - dr5 we have shown that the large scale distribution of galaxies is strongly wavelength dependent : in hi the cluster core almost completely disappears and hi selected galaxies are homogeneously distributed in the cluster volume .",
    "the difference between the two samples is even more evident when we compare their luminosity and hi distribution .",
    "our optically selected sample misses a considerable number of low luminosity , low surface brightness galaxies underestimating by almost a factor 2 the number of hi rich galaxies present in the cluster volume . on the contrary",
    "our hi sample contains a factor 3 less bright galaxies than the optical one .",
    "these are mainly ellipticals or early type , red spirals but also a not negligible fraction of the blue sequence cluster spirals is missed .",
    "all these blue gas - poor objects are located near the edge of the x - ray cluster contours suggesting that their gas has been recently ( @xmath1 100 myr ) stripped by ram pressure so that the galaxies are already gas poor whereas their stellar populations are still young .",
    "+ although the spatial and number distribution of samples selected at different wavelengths are significantly different , the internal properties of galaxies seem not to be significantly wavelengths dependent .",
    "hi galaxies seem to follow the same scaling relations observed in optical and bigger galaxies are redder , have a higher surface brightness and a lower gas content than lower luminosity galaxies .",
    "the most interesting result of our analysis is that the baryon fraction of our sample appears to be almost constant , suggesting the difference in the star to gas ratio observed between bright and faint galaxies is only due to a different star formation efficiency ( i.e. the time scale necessary to convert gas into stars ) .",
    "this is the first time that such a result is obtained from an hi selected sample and even if consistent with models of galaxy formation it suggests that during their evolutionary history less massive galaxies do not lose a larger fraction of their baryons than bigger objects .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper points out the importance of hi blind surveys like ages in order to have an unbiased view of the properties of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "once the survey is at a more advanced stage and the size of our sample is significantly bigger than the one presented here it will be possible to carry out more detailed quantitative studies and comparisons between optically and hi selected samples , gaining more insight into the evolutionary history of nearby galaxies .",
