    "the ab initio band structure calculations of strongly - interacting low - dimensional ( quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) or two - dimensional ( 2d ) ) systems ( high-@xmath1 superconductor yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 as well as charge - density - wave ( cdw ) systems k@xmath5moo@xmath3 and bavs@xmath3 being examples @xcite ) usually reveal several bands in the vicinity of the fermi level that are , in the leading approximation , decoupled from the rest of the band structure . in the tight - binding approximation ,",
    "the bare dispersions of such a multiband model are well understood in terms of the strong hybridization among several properly chosen orbitals per unit cell , while the hybridization with the other electronic levels is neglected .",

    "all these ingredients make strongly - interacting multiband electronic problems extremely complicated .",
    "to explain most of experimental results on typical single - band systems , it usually suffices to describe properly the coupling between @xmath6 monopole charge fluctuations and external electromagnetic ( em ) fields and combine this coupling hamiltonian with the ordinary transport equations .",
    "@xcite however , in multiband electronic systems , even in the cases when only one band intersects the fermi level , the analysis is considerably more complicated . not only the interband physics but also the intraband physics depends drastically on both single - particle and two - particle parameters of the hamiltonian and are affected differently by various types of fluctuations .",
    "therefore , to understand the results of transport measurements @xcite and reflectivity measurements @xcite of multiband electronic systems in detail , we describe the @xmath6 multipolar fluctuations in the dynamical conductivity tensor in a way consistent with the results of experimental methods which probe charge and spin fluctuations which presumably occur at finite wave vectors @xcite .",

    "<S> a systematic method of calculating the dynamical conductivity tensor in a general multiband electronic model with strong boson - mediated electron - electron interactions is described . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is based on the exact semiclassical expression for the coupling between valence electrons and electromagnetic fields and on the self - consistent bethe  </S>",
    "<S> salpeter equations for the electron - hole propagators . </S>",
    "<S> the general diagrammatic perturbation expressions for the intraband and interband single - particle conductivity are determined . </S>",
    "<S> the relations between the intraband bethe  salpeter equation , the quantum transport equation and the ordinary transport equation are briefly discussed within the memory - function approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the lorentz dipole - dipole interactions on the dynamical conductivity of low - dimensional @xmath0 models are described in the same approximation . </S>",
    "<S> such formalism proves useful in studies of different ( pseudo)gapped states of quasi - one - dimensional systems with the metal - to - insulator phase transitions and can be easily extended to underdoped two - dimensional high-@xmath1 superconductors . </S>"
