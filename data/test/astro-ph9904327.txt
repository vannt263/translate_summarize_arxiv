    "elliptical galaxies in the local universe are known to populate only a two - dimensional manifold , known as the fundamental plane ( hereafter fp ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) , in the three - dimensional space defined by effective radius @xmath3 , mean surface brightness within the effective radius sb@xmath4 ( sb@xmath5const ; i is the surface brightness in linear flux ) , and central velocity dispersion  @xmath6 .",
    "the fp is described by : @xmath7 @xmath3 is in kpc ( while @xmath8 is in arcsecs ) , @xmath6 in km  @xmath9 , sb@xmath4 in @xmath10 and @xmath11 is hereafter assumed to be 50 @xmath12 km  @xmath9@xmath13 .",
    "typical values of the coefficients are for example @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 in johnson b ( bender et al .  1998 ; hereafter b98 ) .",
    "it is still unclear whether the thickness of the fp is intrinsic , i.e. , due to scatter in the properties of elliptical galaxies , or is due to observational errors .",
    "the existence of the empirical scaling described by the fp has strong implications in terms of galactic evolution and formation theories .",
    "for example , the fp suggests that the distributions of dark and luminous matter are related , since @xmath6 depends on the total gravitational potential , whereas sb@xmath4 and @xmath3 trace only the stellar mass .",
    "the fp can be explained in terms of homology , of the virial theorem , and of the existence of a well - defined relation between luminosity and mass , @xmath17 ( faber et al . , 1987 ; see also van albada , bertin & stiavelli  1995 ) .",
    "this interpretation requires a relation between the derived values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , namely @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "measuring the fp parameters for ellipticals at intermediate redshift @xmath22@xmath23 has only recently become feasible ( pahre , djorgovski & de carvalho 1995 ; van dokkum & franx 1996 ; bender et al .",
    "1996 ; kelson et al . 1997 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "this opens up two important questions which bear on the age , formation history , and internal properties of elliptical galaxies : _ i ) _ how far in the past does an fp - like relation apply ? and _ ii ) _ do its parameters evolve significantly with time ?",
    "the existence of a tight fp - like relation at substantial look - back times would suggest the existence of a universal relation between mass and formation time for ellipticals , since , e.g. , population differences would be amplified as the redshift increases .",
    "existing measurements of the properties of ellipticals at intermediate redshifts have concentrated so far on relatively rich clusters of galaxies , where bright ellipticals are easier to find @xcite and observations can be carried out efficiently with multi - object spectrographs .",
    "when comparing , e.g. , the fp of intermediate redshift and zero redshift clusters one must take into account the evolution with redshift of the population of galaxies in clusters , and environmental effects .",
    "although the evolution of clusters of galaxies is still somewhat controversial @xcite , the galaxy population in rich clusters is likely to become less uniform ( in terms , e.g. , of age and metallicity ) with time , due to accretion of isolated galaxies and small groups .",
    "moreover , the question of whether there are systematic differences between cluster and field ellipticals ( the latter including galaxies in loose groups or poor clusters ) is still open even at low redshift @xcite . a study of the galaxy properties as a function of look - back time provides a sensitive probe of the possible evolutionary differences between cluster and field ellipticals .",
    "for these reasons , we have begun a study of the empirical scaling laws of field ellipticals at intermediate redshift .",
    "we have started out by defining a sample of ellipticals which is not biased in favour of rich clusters .",
    "details on the selection process are given in section  [ sec : sample ] .",
    "sections  [ sec : foto ] and [ sec : spec ] describe the data reduction and the error analysis",
    ". measurements at non - zero redshift have to be carried out with photometric filters and effective apertures that differ from those used to derive the local scaling laws ; section  [ sec : corr ] describes the conversion of our measurements to the standard quantities .",
    "the main results are reported in section  [ sec : res ] , where our measurements are compared to local samples and intermediate redshift cluster samples .",
    "a summary is given in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "with this study we aim at addressing two questions : _",
    "i ) _ does the fp of field ellipticals evolve with redshift ? and",
    "_ ii ) _ do , at any given redshift , the field ellipticals have fp parameters different from those found in rich cluster environments ?",
    "for this we need to select a primary sample of galaxies biased against rich cluster membership at intermediate redshift , where the project is feasible and the look - back time ( @xmath24@xmath25 gyrs ) is high enough that evolution can be noticeable .",
    "the targets used in this study have been chosen among a sample of random ellipticals found in the wfpc2 parallel images collected by the medium deep survey @xcite .",
    "the target pool has been selected originally from available hst images in the appropriate ra , @xmath26 range according to the following criteria :    1 .",
    "apparent magnitude @xmath27 2 .",
    "morphology clearly defined as elliptical , with an apparent effective radius @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 colour in agreement with the empiric relation for ellipticals in the redshift range @xmath30 ( @xmath31 )    magnitudes and colours above are as defined by the medium deep survey group @xcite ; @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the magnitudes in the wfpc2 filters f606w and f814w , computed in the wfpc2 flight system ( holtzman et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the effective radius @xmath34 is the value found from the two - dimensional image fitting carried out by the mds .",
    "all photometric parameters have been rederived here with two different techniques ( see section  [ sec : foto ] ) to ensure a self - consistent treatment .",
    "individual targets were then selected from this pool of approximately 25 candidates on the basis of convenience and availability during each observing night ; in the spirit of this exploratory study , we did not attempt further to achieve uniformity or completeness within our pool of candidates .    since we did not explicitly exclude members of poor clusters ( no rich clusters were observed in these random fields ) ,",
    "the ellipticals in our sample should be representative of a random , magnitude - selected sample of non - rich - cluster objects .",
    "in fact , four of the six objects for which we have obtained fp parameters happen to be members of a group ( or a poor cluster ) , which was randomly observed in the available hst images .",
    "future observations will enable us to achieve a better level of completeness and thus to better characterise our sample .",
    "our colour selection criterion will bias against actively star - forming ellipticals , which are known to occur , albeit infrequently , in complete samples @xcite .",
    "we plan to relax the blue cutoff in future observations .",
    "the characteristics of the objects we observed are summarised in table  [ tab : obj ] . the final sample used in the discussion in section  [ sec : res ]",
    "is composed of the galaxies successfully fitted with the two different photometric techniques , isophotal profile fit and two - dimensional fit , and with measured kinematics .",
    "the photometry of * c , l , m , n * was of low quality due to companion galaxies , stars in the field of view and the faintness of the objects .",
    "the 2d fit was performed only on the galaxies with a high quality isophotal profile .",
    "we were able to determine high quality photometric parameters for * g * by subtracting a model of its companion * h * from the image before the 2d fit .",

    "dashes in column 7 indicate that the 2d fit was not performed . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : fres ]    we consider two scaling laws : the fp ( eq .  [ eq : fp ] ) and the kormendy relation @xcite @xmath36 the latter is useful for our purposes because it does not involve internal kinematics , and thus it can be followed to higher redshifts ( @xmath37 for our sample ) , although it has a larger intrinsic scatter than the fp and its coefficients are much more sensitive to sample selection biases ( see e.g. , capaccioli , caon & donofrio 1992 ) .    because of the small number of points in our sample , we do not try to rederive the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the fp independently , but we compare our sample of field ellipticals with the local relations , adopting their slopes . in figures  [ fig : allvscoma ] and [ fig : ben ] we compare our galaxies with a sample of coma ellipticals in johnson v ( lucey at el .",
    "1991 , hereafter l91 ) and with a recent determination of the fp in johnson b , @xmath40 , ( b98 ) .",
    "the mean offset @xmath41 ( defined as the mean of @xmath42 over the data points ) is 0.10 with respect to the l91 sample ( using the slopes given in l91 , i.e. @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) and 0.07 in johnson b. we also compared our data _",
    "i ) _ to the 7 samurai sample @xcite obtaining @xmath41=0.08 and 0.07 , respectively in johnson b and v and _ ii ) _ to the fp in gunn @xmath45 ( jfk96 ) , finding @xmath46 with respect to the coma zero point , even if the colour corrections increase in this case the uncertainty .",
    "the rms scatter of our points is 0.16 in @xmath47 giving a standard deviation of the mean value of about 0.07 in @xmath48 .",
    "considering other smaller sources of error such as the peculiar velocity of coma and the colour transformations we can estimate the uncertainty on @xmath49 to be @xmath50 .",
    "the offset found can be interpreted as a result of the evolution of the mean @xmath51 ratio , @xmath52 .",
    "in other words , our field galaxies are more luminous than a local elliptical with the same effective radius and @xmath6 ( dimension and mass ) , consistently with the expected evolution of stellar populations , and in agreement with the results found by bender et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , ziegler & bender ( 1997 ) , kelson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , schade , barrientos & lpez - cruz ( 1997 ) and van dokkum et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , for the cluster environment .",
    "if we exclude from the analysis the two galaxies * e * and * f * with lower signal - to - noise spectra , the mean offset becomes 0.15 with respect to the l91 sample , 0.11 to b98 , 0.13 and 0.12 to the 7 samurai b and v and 0.12 to jfk96 .",
    "the scatter is practically unchanged ( 0.16 ) .",
    "the change in the offset is not negligible , but is not statistically significant .",
    "more data are needed to extend this preliminary study to larger sample in order to overcome small number fluctuations and to measure the offset and scatter with smaller errors . moreover when a larger sample will be available ,",
    "it will be possible to measure the offset in smaller redshift bins , thus providing homogeneous subsamples .",
    "clusters provide a homogeneous environment for the formation of ellipticals .",
    "in contrast , there is no _ a priori _ reason to believe that randomly selected field galaxies have formed at the same epoch , and any differences in the formation redshift will be amplified with look - back time .",
    "therefore , one might have expected to find a larger scatter for our field relation ( if any relation was to be found at all ) than in the cluster fp .",
    "the scatter we find for our data points ( 0.16 in @xmath47 , using the local slopes ) is in fact larger than the scatter found by , e.g. , l91 ( 0.075 ) .",
    "part of this scatter can be explained because we are considering a small sample of galaxies at different redshifts ( and therefore different @xmath49 ; from a geometric point of view , the plane is thicker because is the superimposition of parallel planes ) .",
    "it is not clear however whether there is a residual scatter , and a larger sample is required to investigate the intrinsic variations of the formation and evolutionary history for galaxies not in rich clusters .      obviously , a larger sample of field galaxies is necessary to assess whether they truly obey an fp - like relation and whether , and how much , their properties vary with redshift . however , a significant body of data is now available on ellipticals at intermediate redshifts , mostly from clusters , and it is instructive to look at our sample in the context of the cluster data as well .    we consider here a total of 25 ellipticals from the papers of van dokkum and franx ( 1996 , 4 objects ) , kelson et al .",
    "( 1997 , 15 objects ) , and from our sample ( 6 objects ) .",
    "the first consideration is that these galaxies , much like ours , fit reasonably well with the zero - redshift relations ( see figure  [ fig : allvscoma ] ) .",
    "the zero point determined from all these galaxies using the l91 slopes is @xmath53 ( figure  [ fig : allvscoma ] ) , very similar to the value obtained with our six field galaxies alone .    with this sample",
    ", it is also possible to determine the fp slopes @xmath54 and @xmath39 independently of the low - redshift measurements .",
    "the results depend on the method used for the minimisation ( @xmath18 especially , while @xmath19 is better determined ) . using the technique described in jfk96 , which equally weights the three fp parameters ,",
    "we obtain @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( figure  [ fig : allvshigh ] ) .",
    "we estimate the errors to be @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this choice of the slopes reduces the scatter in @xmath59 from 0.13 ( with respect to the local relation ) to about 0.10 .",
    "the relation @xmath20 ( see section [ sec : intro ] ) still holds within the errors .",
    "if the reasoning is carried out with the assumption of the single parameter @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , this would lead to @xmath62 .",
    "if confirmed with better statistics , this variation might imply a differential passive evolution as a function of mass , i.e. a mass - dependent formation redshift .    in figure",
    "[ fig : totkor ] we show the kormendy relation between sb@xmath4 and @xmath3 for nine galaxies in our field sample ( up to z=0.647 ) plus the 25 other intermediate redshift cluster ellipticals .",
    "the intermediate redshift data are compared in the figure with the l91 sample of coma ellipticals .",
    "an average offset of @xmath63 magnitudes is found between the intermediate redshift cluster and field sample and the local coma sample .",
    "the intermediate redshift galaxies are therefore on average brighter ( at the same @xmath3 ) , consistently with what is found using the fp . in order to determine the slope @xmath64 , a sample with well - controlled selection biases is required .",
    "the intermediate redshift sample was not chosen to this aim and therefore we do not attempt to derive the value of @xmath64 .",
    "more data and carefully selected subsamples are needed to assess if the field kormendy relation at intermediate redshift differs significantly from the cluster one .",
    "with the instrumental setup and the procedure described sections 3 , 4 and 5 , we have measured the fundamental plane parameters of intermediate redshift field elliptical galaxies . as an important part of the data - reduction procedure we have carried out accurate k - corrections and spectroscopic aperture corrections .",
    "given the importance of the template spectrum choice for the kinematic fit , we have decided to make use of a wide set of spectra , checking how the results vary with the spectral type , as described in section 4 , obtaining at the same time an estimate of the systematic error produced by the choice of the template spectrum .",
    "while the number of galaxies studied here is too small to draw firm conclusions on the properties of field ellipticals at intermediate redshift , the preliminary evidence suggests that :    1 .",
    "our six field ellipticals at redshift @xmath65 , are in agreement with the local fp relation , with a variation of the zero point ( @xmath66 ) , and a scatter of 0.16 in @xmath67 .",
    "this means that the stellar populations of our sample of field galaxies are brighter than the local ellipticals , with the same size and mass .",
    "this data fit into a scenario in which our galaxies , at a look - back time of @xmath24@xmath25 gyrs , are evolving passively .",
    "the small sample and the sample selection criteria do not allow any more general conclusion .",
    "the fp obtained from our data and the cluster ellipticals at intermediate redshift @xcite is well defined with a scatter of 0.13 in @xmath47 with respect to the local relation .",
    "the full intermediate redshift sample is large enough to perform the fit the fp coefficients independently . using the fitting technique used by jfk96 ,",
    "we find @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and the scatter is reduced to 0.10 . by interpreting the fundamental plane as a result of homology , the virial theorem and the existence of a relation @xmath70 @xcite , different slopes at different redshift imply a variation of @xmath60 with time , i.e. , a mass - dependent evolution .",
    "the good agreement between the field and cluster galaxies suggests that there are no significant differences in the history of the two environments .",
    "more data are needed to perform separate fit to the two subsamples .",
    "the kormendy relation between sb@xmath4 and @xmath3 for all the intermediate redshift data shows an offset of @xmath71 magnitudes in surface brightness with respect to the coma ellipticals ( l91 ) , in agreement with what is found using the fp . even though caution is needed , due to possible sample selection biases",
    ", the variation of the kormendy relation suggests that the evolution found via the fundamental plane , extends to galaxies at higher redshift .",
    "carefully selected samples of field and cluster intermediate redshift are needed to study the the kormendy relation in greater detail and to investigate the possible differences between the two environments .",
    "further discussion on the evolution of elliptical galaxies will be given in a follow - up paper ( paper ii ; stiavelli et al .",
