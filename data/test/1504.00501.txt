    "the laws of thermodynamics are also equally applicable to quantum mechanical systems .",
    "a lot of progress has been made recently in studying the cold trap atoms that are largely isolated from surroundings @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the availability of feshbach resonances is shown to be useful to control the strength of interactions , to realize strongly correlated systems , and to drive these systems between different quantum phases in controlled manner @xcite .",
    "these experiments have raised the possibility of understanding the emergence of thermodynamics from principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "the fundamental questions that one hopes to answer from these investigations are : how the macroscopic laws of thermodynamics emerge from the reversible quantum dynamics ? how to understand the thermalization of a closed quantum systems ?",
    "what are the relations between information , thermodynamics and quantum mechanics @xcite ?",
    "while answer to these questions , for many body system is out of sight , some important progress has been made by considering simple lattice systems ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this work , in an attempt to address some of the above questions , our focus is on another simple , yet , macroscopic system  black - holes .",
    "it has long been conjectured that a black hole s thermodynamic entropy is given by its entropy of entanglement across the horizon  @xcite .",
    "however , this has never been directly related to the hawking temperature  @xcite . here",
    "we show that :    a.   hawking temperature is given by the rate of change of the entropy of entanglement across a black hole s horizon with regard to the system energy .",
    "b.   the information lost across the horizon is related to black hole entropy and laws of black hole mechanics emerge from entanglement across the horizon .",
    "the model we consider is complementary to other models that investigate the emergence of thermodynamics @xcite : first , we evaluate the entanglement entropy for a relativistic free scalar fields propagating in the black - hole background while the simple lattice models that were considered are non - relativistic .",
    "second , quantum entanglement can be unambiguously quantified only for bipartite systems  @xcite .",
    "while the bipartite system is an approximation for applications to many body systems , here , the event horizon provides a natural boundary .",
    "evaluation of the entanglement of a relativistic free scalar field , as always , is the simplest model .",
    "however , even for free fields it is difficult to obtain the entanglement entropy .",
    "the free fields are gaussian and these states are entirely characterized by the covariance matrix .",
    "it is generally difficult to handle covariance matrices in an infinite dimensional hilbert space @xcite .",
    "there are two ways to calculate entanglement entropy in the literature .",
    "one approach is to use the replica trick which rests on evaluating the partition function on an n - fold cover of the background geometry where a cut is introduced throughout the exterior of the entangling surface @xcite .",
    "second is a _ direct approach _",
    ", where the hamiltonian of the field is discretized and the reduced density matrix is evaluated in the real space .",
    "we adopt this approach as entanglement entropy may have more symmetries than the lagrangian of the system  @xcite .    to remove the spurious effects due to the coordinate singularity at the horizon need to be bipartited @xcite . ]",
    ", we consider lematre coordinate which is explicitly time - dependent .",
    "one of the features that we exploit in our computation is that for a fixed lematre time coordinate , hamiltonian of the scalar field in schwarzschild space - time reduces to the scalar field hamiltonian in flat space - time @xcite .",
    "the procedure we adopt is the following :    a.   we perturbatively evolve the hamiltonian about the fixed lematre time",
    ". b.   we obtain the entanglement entropy at different times .",
    "we show that at all times , the entanglement entropy satisfies the area law i. e. @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the entanglement entropy evaluated at a given lematre time @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the proportionality constant that depends on @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the area of black hole horizon . in other words ,",
    "the value of the entropy is different at different times .",
    "we calculate the change in entropy as function of @xmath4 , i. e. , @xmath6 .",
    "similarly we calculate change in energy @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath8 .    for several black - hole metrics ,",
    "we explicitly show that ratio of the rate of change of energy and the rate of change of entropy is identical to the hawking temperature .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "( [ sec.1 ] ) , we set up our model hamiltonian to obtain the entanglement entropy in ( @xmath9)-dimensional space time . also , we define _ entanglement temperature _ , which had the same structure from the statistical mechanics ,",
    "that is , ratio of change in total energy to change in entanglement entropy . in sec .",
    "( [ sec.2 ] ) , we numerically show that for different black hole space times , the divergent free _ entanglement temperature _ matches approximately with the hawking temperature obtained from general theory of relativity and its lovelock generalization .",
    "this provides a strong evidence towards the interpretation of entanglement entropy as the bekenstein - hawking entropy . finally in sec .",
    "( [ sec.3 ] ) , we conclude with a discussion to connect our analysis with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for the closed quantum systems @xcite .    throughout this work ,",
    "the metric signature we adopt is @xmath10 and set @xmath11 .",
    "before we go on to evaluating entanglement entropy ( ee ) of a quantum scalar field propagating in black - hole background , we briefly discuss the motivation for the studying entanglement entropy of a scalar field .",

    "d.   scalar field propagating in this coordinate system is explicitly time - dependent .",

    "<S> we explicitly show that the hawking temperature is indeed given by the rate of change of the entropy of entanglement across a black hole s horizon with regard to the system energy . </S>",
