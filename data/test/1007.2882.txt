    "data taken in the last few years have demonstrated that the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has created a strongly interacting hot , dense medium with partonic degrees of freedom , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in central au+au collisions at @xmath0 = 200 gev  @xcite .",
    "such matter is believed to have existed a few microseconds after the big bang .",
    "understanding the properties of this matter , such as the colored degrees of freedom and the equation of state is the physics goal of rhic and of broad interest .",
    "i will review the experimental results which were used to identify the existence of the hot , dense medium , followed by the measurements of its properties .",
    "future upgrades that are essential to understand the fundamental properties of the medium will be discussed as well .",
    "rhic at brookhaven national laboratory is the first hadron accelerator and collider consisting of two independent rings .",
    "it is designed to operate at high collision luminosity over a wide range of beam energies and particle species ranging from polarized proton to heavy ion  @xcite , where the top energy of the colliding center - of - mass energy per nucleon - nucleon pair is @xmath0 = 200 gev .",
    "the rhic facility consists of two rings with super - conducting magnets , each with a circumference of 3.8 km , which focus and guide the beams .",
    "there are four experiments at rhic , brahms  @xcite , phenix  @xcite , phobos  @xcite , and star  @xcite .",
    "brahms and phobos are relatively small experiments .",
    "they have finished their experimental program and were decommissioned after year 2008 . star and phenix , the two large detectors , are still in operation .",
    "in 2000 , the experiments started to take data . in 2005 , the four experiments published white papers summarizing what has been discovered .",
    "the details can be found in all four white papers  @xcite . the focus of rhic was to identify the existence of the qgp .",
    "below i will review two probes used to identify qgp , bulk probes and penetrating probes .",
    "bulk probes include measurements of the majority of produced particles at low @xmath1 ( @xmath2 gev/@xmath3 ) to address the energy density , collectivity and freeze out properties of hot , dense medium . penetrating probes are the measurements of the rarely produced particles such as heavy flavor , jets and identified particles at high @xmath1 ( @xmath4 gev/@xmath3 ) to see the medium effect on their productions and",
    "thereby are used to deduce medium properties .",
    "the measurements at intermediate @xmath1 ( @xmath5 gev/@xmath3 ) probe the interplay between bulk and hard components and reveal some unique interesting features of the collisions at rhic .      many measurements at rhic have studied the bulk properties of the collisions , including low @xmath1 identified particle transverse momentum and rapidity distributions in different collision centralities , system sizes and collision energies .",
    "the measurements indicate that rhic has created a hot and dense partonic medium which expands and cools down hydrodynamically .",
    "hadrons freeze out chemically at close to critical temperature ( @xmath6 ) and then freeze out kinetically at lower temperature .",
    "below are several important measurements that point to the existence of a hot , dense medium and its freeze out features .    *",
    "the rapidity dependence of particle multiplicity demonstrates that the 26 tev energy has been dumped in the system to produce particles in 200 gev central au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "the energy density is much higher than normal nuclear matter density thus it is believed that partonic matter is formed in such collisions  @xcite .",
    "* the measurements of elliptic flow @xmath7 , the second harmonic coefficient of a fourier expansion of the final momentum - space anisotropic azimuthal distribution , show mass dependence at low @xmath1 consistent with hydrodynamic behaviors with quark gluon plasma equation of state  @xcite .",
    "the quantitative consistency between data and hydrodynamic model calculations is lacked and complicated by initial conditions , hadronization and freeze out processes .",
    "however , the magnitude of the elliptic low can be reproduced only when partonic interactions are included in the calculations . *",
    "the identified particle @xmath1 distributions were measured and fit with the blast - wave model using thermal - like distribution or tsallis - like distributions  @xcite .",
    "the latter include the fluctuation and non - equilibrium effects in the system and can be applied in p+p collisions also .",
    "the thermal - like fit indicates that the kinetic freeze out temperature @xmath8 decreases from p+p to peripheral au+au to central au+au collisions while the velocity profile increases .",
    "this indicates that the system is cooling with expansion .",
    "* the identified particle ratios measured in au+au collisions at different centralities were fit with thermal model distributions  @xcite .",
    "the fit indicates that the chemical freeze out temperature ( @xmath9 ) is about 160 mev and that there is no significant centrality or system size dependence .",
    "this value of @xmath9 is very close to the critical temperature @xmath6 calculated by lattice qcd  @xcite . *",
    "the measurements of resonance to stable particle ratios and hanbury brown - twiss ( hbt ) interferometry of two particle bose - einstein correlations indicate that the time interval between chemical and kinetic freeze out is about 3 - 10 fm / c  @xcite .",
    "the above measurements are consistent with the physics picture in which partonic matter is created at rhic , expands and cools down , and hadronizes into a system of hadrons that freeze out chemically shortly after at a fixed temperature , followed by further expansion and cooling down until kinetic freeze - out .      beside bulk probes , hard probes such as identified particles at high @xmath1 , jets and and heavy flavor",
    "are thought to be ideal probes for quark gluon plasma .",
    "they are thought to be well calibrated since they are believed to be produced from hard processes with high @xmath10 transfer and thus can be calculated in perturbative quantum chromodynamic ( pqcd ) framework  @xcite . in pqcd calculations ,",
    "identified particle production can be described as a convolution of parton distribution functions , parton parton interaction cross sections and parton fragmentation functions .",
    "when hard partons traverse the hot and dense medium created in the collision , they lose energy by gluon radiation and/or colliding elastically with surrounding partons  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is also called jet quenching .",
    "jet quenching leads to a softening of the final measured hadron spectra at high @xmath1 .",
    "the amount of energy loss can be calculated in qcd and is expected to be different for energetic gluons , light quarks and heavy quarks  @xcite . in experiments , in order to quantify the effect of the medium , the nuclear modification factors ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) are measured , where the invariant yield in a+b collisions is divided by that in p+p or peripheral a+b collisions , scaled by their respective numbers of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "if there was no nuclear medium effect , the ratio would be 1 at high @xmath1 .",
    "any deviation from unity therefore indicates nuclear medium effects .",
    "this is similar to medical imaging techniques , where the picture of a human body can be obtained through the calibrated gamma ray interaction .",
    "below several important results are listed to illustrate the properties of the medium through the change in hard probes in central heavy - ion collisions compared to peripheral and to p+p collisions .    *",
    "the @xmath13 of inclusive hadrons in central au+au collisions at 200 gev at mid - rapidity shows a factor of 5 suppression with respective to unity at @xmath14 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "the pqcd calculation with gluon density @xmath15 and with radiative energy loss can describe the suppression  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 of inclusive charged hadrons in d+au collisions shows enhancement at intermediate @xmath1 and equals to unity at high @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the strong suppression observed in @xmath13 in central au+au collisions is due to final state effects and not due to an initial wave function difference such as a possible color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite at mid - rapidity .",
    "* two particle azimuthal angle correlations show that in central au+au collisions , away side particle production at @xmath17 gev / c disappears or is suppressed significantly compared to in p+p and d+au collisions with respect to a high @xmath1 trigger ( @xmath4 gev / c )  @xcite . when the @xmath1 was lowered for associate particles , enhancement of particle production on the away side",
    "was observed compared to p+p and d+au collisions , and the transverse momentum distribution on the away side is softened and approaches the inclusive particle distribution  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the energy loss by the jet on the away side might be thermalized by the system .",
    "the above measurements indicate that the suppression on @xmath13 of high @xmath1 particles in central au+au collisions are consistent with partonic energy loss picture .      between low @xmath1 where the physics is dominated by bulk properties and high @xmath1 where the particle production is by jet fragmentation",
    ", there is also rich physics which can be used to explore the properties of the medium created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "below several interesting results are presented .    * the identified particle elliptic flow measurements for @xmath18 , k , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 indicate that the flow pattern at intermediate @xmath1 seems to follow a simple scaling governed by the fact that mesons ( baryons ) has two ( three ) constituent quarks  @xcite .",
    "even though multi - strange hadrons or @xmath22 have smaller interaction cross sections at hadronic stage , they have a similar flow pattern as non - strange hadrons .",
    "this indicates that the elliptic flow is mainly developed at the partonic stage where the light - strange quark difference is insignificant .",
    "coalescence or recombination models  @xcite , in which two or three constituent quarks are combined into mesons or baryons , were proposed to explain the data .",
    "* at intermediate @xmath1 , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) for baryons is larger than that for mesons , indicating strong baryon enhancement in au+au collisions  @xcite . in central au+au collisions , the @xmath23 ratio reaches unity , which is much larger than that from elementary p+p collisions .",
    "the coalescence or recombination model can qualitatively reproduce the feature .",
    "the parton density at rhic is significant so that parton recombination into hadrons is efficient .",
    "in the same @xmath1 region , the parton @xmath1 for baryons is effectively lower than that for mesons , thus the baryon over meson ratio can be significantly enhanced in the intermediate @xmath1 region in central au+au collisions .    at intermediate @xmath1 , elliptic flow and baryon over meson ratio measurements",
    "are consistent with the recombination or coalescence picture in which partons recombine into hadrons at hadronization .",
    "to summarize this section , the measurements on bulk properties , hard penetrating probes and at intermediate @xmath1 at rhic indicate that rhic has created a dense and rapidly thermalizing matter characterized by : 1 ) initial energy densities far above the critical values predicted by lattice qcd for formation of a qgp ; 2 ) opacity to jets ; and 3 ) nearly ideal fluid flow , which is marked by constituent interactions of very short mean free path , established most probably at a stage preceding hadron formation  @xcite .",
    "the next objective is to study the properties of the created matter in detail in terms of the equation of state and colored degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , one would like to know the temperature , the chemical composition and the velocity of sound of the hot and dense matter .",
    "one would also like to further understand or test jet quenching and ncq scaling and to study other signatures of the quark gluon plasma such as color screening effects .",
    "in this section , several selected recent results will be presented that further our understanding of partonic flow , ncq scaling and jet quenching .",
    "new results on possible color screening effects of qgp are also presented .      with the high statistics data from au+au collisions taken in year 2007 , star measured @xmath7 of @xmath22 and @xmath21 with high precision , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath7 at intermediate @xmath1 is close to the proton and pion @xmath7 respectively .",
    "this indicates that @xmath7 observed at rhic is dominantly due to partonic collectivity  @xcite . with high precision measurements , star and phenix both showed that there is significant deviation from ncq scaling for @xmath7 measurements at intermediate @xmath1  @xcite , which can be understood as the hard component from jet fragmentation starting to play a role in the corresponding @xmath1 region .     as a function of @xmath1 for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 in 200 gev minimum bias au+au collisions .",
    "open symbols are from phenix  @xcite and the solid symbols are from star .",
    "lines represent ncq - inspired fit  @xcite .",
    "the figure is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "to further understand energy loss mechanisms and medium properties , nuclear modification factors for direct photons were measured .",
    "the @xmath13 from direct photons , which are the inclusive photon yields subtracting hadronic decay contributions , is consistent with no suppression at high @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this confirms that the suppression observed in the @xmath13 for hadrons is due to jet quenching , rather than initial wave function change which would affect the direct photons as well .",
    "in addition , nuclear modification factors for protons , pions , non - photonic electrons from heavy flavor decay were also measured to test color charge or flavor dependence of energy loss .",
    "for example , gluons carry different casmir factor from quarks .",
    "the coupling of gluons to the medium is stronger than the coupling of quarks to the medium thus gluons are expected to lose more energy than quarks when traversing the medium . at rhic energy ,",
    "the gluon jet contribution to protons is significantly larger than to pions at high @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "therefore , protons are expected to be more suppressed than pions in @xmath13 or @xmath12 measurement .",
    "experimentally , protons and pions show similar magnitudes of suppression in @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "one of the proposed mechanisms is the jet conversion mechanism  @xcite , in which , a jet can change flavor or color charge after interaction with the medium . with much larger jet conversion cross sections compared to that in the leading order ( lo ) calculation ,",
    "the proton and pion suppression magnitudes are similar . using the same factor scaling the lo qcd calculations , kaons",
    "are predicted to be less suppressed than pions since the initially produced hard strange quarks are much fewer than the strange quarks in a hot , dense medium  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , enhanced parton splitting in the medium will also lead to a change of the jet hadron chemical composition in au+au collisions compared to that in p+p collisions  @xcite .",
    "the new measurements of strange hadrons can test further these mechanisms .",
    "recently , star showed the invariant yields of @xmath18 , k and @xmath19 up to @xmath1 of 15 gev / c in 200 gev p+p collisions at mid - rapidity , which can further constrain light flavor separated quark and gluon fragmentation functions and serves as a baseline for the prediction of au+au collisions at high @xmath1 .",
    "the preliminary results of @xmath13 in central au+au collisions indicated @xmath24 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ]  @xcite .",
    "this provides additional constraints on energy loss calculations .",
    "a full comparison between data and calculations requires consideration of quantitative modelling and calculations incorporating 3d hydro in an expanding medium  @xcite and proper light flavor - separated quark and gluon fragmentation functions .",
    "experimentally , high @xmath1 strange hadron measurements in d+au , its centrality dependence of @xmath13 in au+au and elliptic flow @xmath25 measurements will shed more light on our understanding of energy loss mechanisms .",
    "on the other hand , non - photonic electrons , which come from heavy flavor charm and bottom decay , show a similar magnitude of suppression as light hadrons  @xcite . the pqcd calculations including collisional and radiative energy loss show a systematically higher @xmath13 value than experimental data  @xcite .",
    "further calculations indicate that with the charm contribution only , non - photonic electrons are expected to reproduce the data  @xcite . using the azimuthal angle correlations between non - photonic electrons and charged",
    "hadrons ( e - h ) and between non - photonic electrons and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , the bottom contribution factor to non - photonic electrons were measured  @xcite .",
    "it was found that at @xmath28 gev/@xmath3 , the bottom contribution is very significant .",
    "this together with non - photonic electron @xmath13 measurements challenge the pqcd energy loss model calculations ; they may indicate collisional dissociation of heavy mesons  @xcite , in - medium heavy resonance diffusion  @xcite , and multi - body mechanisms  @xcite might play an important role for heavy quark interactions with the medium .",
    "the dissociation of quarkonia due to color screening in a qgp is a classic signature of de - confinement in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "results at rhic show that the suppression of the @xmath29 as a function of centrality ( the number of participants ) is similar to that observed at the sps , even though the energy density reached in collisions at rhic is significantly higher  @xcite .",
    "possible production mechanisms such as sequential suppression  @xcite , @xmath30 recombination  @xcite were proposed to explain this .",
    "recent lattice qcd calculations indicate that direct @xmath29 is not dissociated in the medium created at rhic while the suppression observed for @xmath29 comes from the dissociation of @xmath31 and @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "however , the direct @xmath29 might be dissociated at rhic at high @xmath33 , which was predicted in the hot wind dissociation picture , in which the ads / cft approach was used and the dissociation temperature for @xmath29 was predicted to decrease as a function of @xmath29 @xmath33  @xcite . the ads / cft approach was applied to hydro framework and predicted that @xmath29 @xmath13 decreases versus @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figure3 ] shows @xmath29 @xmath13 as a function of @xmath33 in 0 - 20% and 0 - 60% cu+cu collisions from star  @xcite and 0 - 20% cu+cu collisions from phenix  @xcite .",
    "the average of two star 0 - 20% data points at high @xmath1 is @xmath34 .",
    "compared to low @xmath33 phenix measurements , the results indicate that @xmath13 of @xmath29 increases from low @xmath33 to high @xmath1 at the 97% confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "the @xmath13 of high @xmath1 @xmath29 is in contrast to strong suppression for open charm  @xcite , indicating that @xmath29 might be dominantly produced through color singlet configuration .",
    "however , even though there is significant improvement from the next - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) pqcd calculations with the color singlet model , the calculation still fails to reproduce the high @xmath1 part  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 trend of @xmath29 is contradictory to ads / cft+hydrodynamic calculations at the 99% c.l .. this might indicate two things : 1 ) cu+cu system is not big enough so that the calculation is not applicable .",
    "the larger system produced in au+au collisions may be necessary to observe or exclude the effect predicted by ads / cft ; 2 ) the formation time effect for high @xmath1 @xmath29 is important since the ads / cft+hydrodynamic calculation shown in fig .  [ figure3 ] requires that the @xmath29 be produced as an on - shell @xmath29 fermion pair , almost instantaneously , at the initial impact with no formation time .",
    "a calculation combining effects of @xmath29 formation time , color screening , hadronic phase dissociation , statistical @xmath30 coalescence and b meson feed - down contribution can describe the data  @xcite .",
    "the calculation suggests a slight increase in the @xmath13 at higher @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath13 versus @xmath33 .",
    "the box about unity on the left shows @xmath13 normalization uncertainty , which is the sum in quadrature of p+p normalization and binary collision scaling uncertainties .",

    "the uncertainty band of 10% for the dotted curve is not shown .",
    "figure is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    in summary , the recent measurements further confirm that a partonic , hot and dense medium is created in central au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "the strong suppression in @xmath13 for hadrons is due to jet quenching .",
    "however , even though the framework of jet quenching might be valid , the details of how jets interact with the medium and lose energy need more detailed theoretical assessments and coherent modelling is required . to understand possible color screening effects of quarkonia , it is necessary to understand their production mechanisms in elementary p+p collisions .",
    "nuclear modification factors for heavy quarkonia can help further constrain their production mechanisms as well .",
    "star and phenix recently updated their data acquisition and trigger systems , which will help sample rhic ii luminosity . with several detector upgrades , heavy flavor collectivity and energy loss , color screening effects , qgp thermal radiation  @xcite and jet quenching will be studied with better precision at rhic .",
    "the non - photonic electron analyses suffer from big systematic uncertainties , which are related to photonic background reconstruction and/or subtraction from hadronic decays . in the future , with the heavy flavor tracker upgrade at star , the direct topological reconstruction of heavy favor hadron decays will be feasible and direct charmed hadron measurements will be obtained with good precision  @xcite . with the silicon vertex detector upgrades , phenix will be able to measure non - photonic electrons from charm and bottom decay separately  @xcite .",
    "these measurements are crucial to understand heavy flavor energy loss thus further constrain the details of jet quenching .",
    "the collectivity measurements from heavy flavor will be important to understand the thermalization for light flavor .      to further understand the production mechanisms of quarkonia , color screening effects and medium properties ,",
    "the precise measurements of the following are needed : nuclear modification factors of @xmath29 from low to high @xmath1 in au+au and d+au collisions , @xmath29 @xmath7 , forward and backward @xmath29 production to address intrinsic charm contributions at large @xmath35  @xcite , @xmath36 correlations to access the feeddown contribution , the spin alignment of @xmath29  @xcite , higher charmonia states and different @xmath37 states  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37 states are also ideal tools to study the effect of color screening in hot and dense qcd matter since its ground state and excited states melt at different temperatures and all of them decay to dileptons  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since the @xmath38 cross section at rhic energy is expected to be much smaller compared to @xmath30 cross section from fonll calculations  @xcite , the recombination contribution from qgp phase might be negligible to bottomonia production .",
    "this makes the @xmath37 even a better probe for studying the color screening effect in qgp if sufficient statistics can be achieved experimentally .",
    "the time of flight system  @xcite , fully installed in the summer of 2009 , will enhance the @xmath29 capability at low @xmath1 significantly at star .",
    "rhic ii luminosity enables the @xmath37 @xmath13 measurements with good precision . with the possible muon telescope detector upgrade ,",
    "star can cleanly separate the ground state from the excited states even with the additional material from the upgraded inner tracker since the muons in @xmath39 do not suffer from bremsstrahlung radiation  @xcite . with the silicon vertex detector upgrade ,",

    "we can measure @xmath43 to see whether there is a mass shift or broadening and also compare the possible @xmath44 measurements .",
    "these measurements will shed light on the study of chiral symmetry restoration . at the intermediate mass region , in order to get the signature of qgp thermal radiation , the @xmath30 from heavy flavor decay must be subtracted .",
    "figure  [ figure4 ] shows the dilepton invariant mass distribution after background subtraction .",
    "you can see at low mass region , there is significant enhancement  @xcite .",
    "further study indicates that the enhancement is mainly at low @xmath1 . from the low mass and higher @xmath1 region ,",
    "the direct photon measurements were obtained at @xmath45 gev / c .",
    "the average temperature of qgp at rhic was obtained by phenix  @xcite . at the intermediate mass region ,",
    "currently , there is no conclusion yet as to whether there is enhancement from thermal radiation or not .",
    "the current measurement suffered from large systematic uncertainties . in the future , the precise measurements of d mesons with the heavy flavor tracker  @xcite and non - photonic electrons from charm decay with the silicon vertex detector  @xcite will help constrain the @xmath30 background contribution . however , the measurement of @xmath30 correlation is still challenging .",
    "the muon telescope detector in star will provide @xmath46 correlation for the much needed independent measurements of heavy - flavor contribution to the dileptons  @xcite .",
    "direct photons at high @xmath1 are believed to be a golden probe to study jet quenching since photons do not interact with the medium  @xcite .",
    "for example , if we trigger on a direct photon and look at away side hadrons or identified particles , the fragmentation function can be precisely studied and compared to theoretical calculations  @xcite .",
    "both star and phenix measured the fragmentation functions in p+p and au+au collisions with respect to a direct photon trigger and the results are consistent with most of the theoretical calculations  @xcite . in the future , with rhic ii luminosity , precise measurements on the away side in both p+p and au+au",
    "will shed light on the path length dependence of energy loss  @xcite , color charge dependence of energy loss  @xcite and jet conversion etc .",
    "recently , the results for full jet reconstruction at rhic were also shown  @xcite .",
    "the preliminary results indicate a significant broadening of energy profile in au+au collisions .",
    "rhic ii luminosity will make the measurements more precise thus how the jet energy loss disperses in the medium will be better understood .    to summarize the section , detector upgrades together with rhic ii",
    "luminosity will enable the rhic experiments to put further constraints on the characteristics of jet quenching .",
    "the study of color screening through different quarkonia states and precise dilepton measurements will also be enabled .",
    "possible thermal radiation signatures may be obtained allowing the temperature of the qgp created at rhic to be inferred . while the efforts mentioned above are mainly to study the properties of qgp in detail , an effort to understand phase transition and explore the phase diagram is also on - going at rhic .",
    "the baryon chemical potential ( @xmath47 ) at top energy at rhic is very close to zero  @xcite . at top energy ,",
    "the transition from hadronic to partonic matter was thought to be a cross - over transition  @xcite .",
    "when we go to larger @xmath47 , several calculations indicate that the transition might be first order  @xcite . to know where the first order phase transition ends is of great interest .",
    "the signature of a first order phase transition such as long range fluctuations in event - by - event observables will be measured .",
    "together with the identified particle ratio measurements , the @xmath47 and @xmath9 freeze out temperature can be obtained .    at rhic",
    ", a lower energy scan has been proposed to study the phase diagram and also to see at what energy , the signatures of qgp disappear such as jet quenching , large elliptic flow and ncq scaling etc  @xcite . in 2007 , rhic had a test run at 9.2 gev .",
    "star has analyzed the data , 3000 good events , for identified particle spectra , elliptic flow and hbt radii and submitted a paper with these results for publication  @xcite . compared to a previous lower energy program at the sps , rhic experiments have uniform acceptance for all beam energies thus systematic uncertainties can be reduced .",
    "also there will be less ambiguity when comparing the results in different energies .",
    "the large acceptance and excellent particle identification from the detectors at rhic will enable significant qualitative and quantitative improvements in the measurements compared to sps .",
    "beside the major discovery of qgp created at rhic , there are many other discovery possibilities .",
    "recently , the anti - hypertriton was measured at the star experiment .",
    "this is the first observation of an antimatter hypernucleus  @xcite .",
    "this opens the window to studying hyperon - baryon interactions .",
    "also at rhic , star collaborators found that the correlation between same ( different ) charged sign particles is positive ( negative )  @xcite .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the strong parity violation picture , which induces charge separation with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "the charge separation can occur if two possible scenarios exist : chiral symmetry restoration and a strong magnetic field in qgp  @xcite .",
    "similar measurements at lower beam energies will help the understanding of this effect and determine if strong parity violation is the only explanation for the observation .",
    "in addition , the search for the cgc  @xcite and qcd critical point  @xcite are important and ongoing programs at rhic too .",
    "in summary , i have presented measurements that identify the existence of qgp at rhic .",
    "several recent new measurements are presented that further our understanding of partonic flow and ncq scaling , jet quenching and the color screening effect in qgp .",
    "the future upgrades at rhic will significantly enhance the capability for dilepton and heavy flavor measurements , which will further our understanding of the properties of qgp .",
