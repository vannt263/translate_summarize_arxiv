    "cosmic shear shows great promise for testing the cosmological model and measuring cosmological parameters .",
    "it measures the gravitational bending ( lensing ) of light by all the intervening mass in the universe . in cosmic shear , distant ( background )",
    "galaxies provide a convenient screen of objects with potentially simple statistical properties , from which the light bending can be inferred .",
    "the distortion depends on the lens geometry and thus on the curvature and expansion history of the universe ; it also depends on the distribution of matter , which itself depends on most aspects of the cosmological model .",
    "cosmic shear was first detected in 2000 @xcite and has been used to constrain cosmological parameters in subsequent surveys ( recently * ? ? ?",
    "cosmic shear has the potential to become the most powerful probe of cosmology because it observes a non - gaussian three dimensional field in the local universe , where the mysterious dark energy dominates .",
    "however a number of details inevitably remain to be investigated further whilst planning for future experiments .",
    "the simplest statistic is the two point angular correlation function ( or integrals of this quantity such as the power spectrum or aperture mass , * ? ? ?",
    "if the background galaxies can be separated into populations at different redshifts the power of this statistic is greatly increased by cross - correlating galaxies in different redshift bins @xcite .",
    "this technique will dominate for future surveys which aim to measure the equation of state of the dark energy , or determine a new gravitational theory .",
    "cosmic shear is particularly simple if distant background galaxies can be assumed to have random orientations .",
    "the distortion by gravitational lensing can then be extracted statistically , for example by averaging over galaxy orientations in a given patch of sky .",
    "unfortunately it is unlikely to be straightforward since when galaxies form they tend to align pointing towards dark matter concentrations due to tidal interactions .",
    "this leads to two complicating effects : ( i ) neighbouring galaxies at a given redshift are intrinsically aligned @xcite and ( ii ) a pair of galaxies at two different redshifts have correlated observed ellipticities because a dark matter concentration close to the nearer object may tidally align the nearer object _ and _ simultaneously gravitationally lens the more distant object @xcite .",
    "these intrinsic alignment effects are complicated because they require an understanding of tidal alignments of galaxies , however they do have a distinctive signature and can therefore be removed without requiring a detailed understanding of galaxy formation @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present another complicating effect which is much simpler than the intrinsic alignment effects : cross - correlation of a pair of galaxies at different redshifts produces a contribution to the usual cosmic shear two - point statistic even if there are no tidal effects .",
    "this is because the nearer galaxy will gravitationally lens the more distant galaxy ( galaxy - galaxy lensing ) .",
    "this effect produces a net anti - correlation in the realistic case when the nearer galaxy ( i ) is not circularly symmetric and ( ii ) has a correlation between the asymmetry of the light and the mass . in this paper",
    "we present this new factor and quantify its effect for elliptical dark matter halos for which mass and light have the same ellipticity and orientation .",
    "first we review ellipticity and shear correlation function notation .",
    "we then illustrate the galaxy - galaxy lensing contribution to the ellipticity correlation function and calculate the effect due to a population of galaxy lenses at a fixed redshift .",
    "we investigate how this effect depends on the source and lens redshift .",
    "finally we compare this to the size of the tomographic cosmic shear cross - correlation signal .",
    "the two - point correlation function of the shear field @xmath2 at positions separated by an angle @xmath3 on the sky is given by @xmath4 , averaging over all pairs of angular separation @xmath3 ( we use complex notation for shears @xmath5 and similarly for ellipticities . ) for a concise introduction to cosmic shear see @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "cosmic shear aims to measure this correlation function by measuring observed ellipticities of distant galaxies @xmath6 and taking into account how intrinsic ( pre - shear ) ellipticities @xmath7 are modified by shear . for small shears",
    "this reduces to @xmath8 ; we define @xmath9 throughout .",
    "an estimate of the shear two point correlation function is obtained from the observed ellipticity correlation function @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the observed ellipticity of a distant galaxy @xmath12 and @xmath13 is that of a nearer galaxy @xmath14 .",
    "therefore we can expand the correlation functions to find @xmath15 , where the shear - ellipticity correlation is given by @xmath16 if we ignore intrinsic alignments ( @xmath17 ) and use @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite calculated the shear - ellipticity correlation function numerically using n - body simulations .",
    "the aim of that work was to quantify the intrinsic alignment - shear correlation presented by @xcite .",
    "their results should in fact contain a mixture of the intrinsic alignment - shear correlation and the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal we present here .",
    "however , they do not discuss the distinction between the two effects , or specifically state that the galaxy - galaxy lensing contribution might be significant .",
    "here we present simple analytical and numerically integrated results to quantify only the galaxy - galaxy lensing contribution .",
    "we assume a concordance @xmath19cdm cosmology throughout , with parameters taken from @xcite : hubble constant @xmath20 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , dark energy equation of state @xmath26 except where otherwise stated .",
    "we assume a flat universe with a scale invariant primordial power spectrum .",
    "in this section we calculate the galaxy - galaxy lensing contribution to @xmath27 , given by @xmath28 , as discussed above . to estimate this quantity",
    "we first calculate the signal for a single elliptical lens averaged over background galaxies at a fixed angular distance , and then average over a population of lenses .",
    "we assume that the lens light has the same ellipticity and orientation as the lens mass .",
    "by default we consider an nfw @xcite mass profile , calculating the projected mass from the equations given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath29 , the mass enclosed within the radius at which the density is 200 times the mean density of the universe , for consistency with simulations .",
    "we derive the concentration parameter , @xmath30 , as a function of @xmath29 using eq .",
    "12 of @xcite with @xmath31 , as appropriate for an nfw model .",
    "we calculate the shear for an elliptical mass distribution using the equations in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that this is not the same as calculations using elliptical potentials , which give dumbbell shaped mass distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". the projected mass distribution is squashed and stretched to have elliptical isodensity contours a factor @xmath32 smaller ( larger ) along the minor ( major ) axes , as compared to the corresponding spherical mass distribution .    the shear map for an elliptical nfw lens of ellipticity @xmath33 aligned along the @xmath34 axis is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] .",
    "the shading and contours show the convergence map ( projected mass density in units of the critical lens density ) .",
    "the overlaid shear sticks show two particularly interesting features : ( i ) the shear on the major axis of the lens is larger than that on the minor axis , for a given angular separation from the lens center ; ( ii ) the shear 45 degrees around from the major axis is approximately tangential to the center of the lens .",
    "these two features do depend on the details of the mass profile , but are general for relevant radii for an elliptical nfw profile , and also for a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) ( for which the shear is always exactly tangential and its amplitude follows the mass , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these two characteristics point towards our main result : that there is a net anti - correlation between lens ellipticity and the resulting shear of background galaxies .",
    "this arises because ( i ) the shears on the major and minor axes cancel out , but only partially , leaving a shear which is perpendicular to the major axis of the lens ; ( ii ) the shear sticks in - between the major and minor axes do not remove this anti - correlation ( for example this could have happened had the shear sticks been aligned along iso - density contours ) .",
    "this is quantified in detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : map_angle ] , which shows the shear - ellipticity correlation for a lens at @xmath35 with a background source at @xmath36 , but as a function of @xmath3 around the lens center ( consider moving around a concentric circular annulus in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ) .",
    "the integral under this curve shows the net effect of averaging over galaxies .",
    "the shape of the curve is non - trivial , but on average is below zero , as shown by the dashed lines .",
    "the larger amplitude oscillation is for the elliptical nfw shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] , and the smaller oscillation is for an sie with the same @xmath29 .",
    "they both show the same qualitative effect at the radius used for the figure ( 0.1 arcmin ) . at larger radii , for the sie",
    ", the average shear - ellipticity correlation remains a similar fraction of the maximum due to the scale independence of the sie .",
    "for the nfw profile , the average becomes a smaller fraction of the maximum due to the steepening of the nfw profile with radius .",
    "the middle dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : cf cosmic shear ] shows this average quantity as a function of angular separation for a single lens of mass @xmath37 and ellipticity @xmath38 .",
    "the other dashed lines show how the effect depends on lens mass .",
    "so far we have shown that for a single foreground lens there is an anti - correlation between shear and lens ellipticity .",
    "we now compare the cosmic shear tomographic cross correlation ( @xmath39 ) with the average of @xmath28 over all foreground lenses . qualitatively : the shear - ellipticity correlation for a single lens is a scalar quantity , and therefore is independent of the angle of the coordinate system . as a result , on averaging over many isolated lenses at different angles to each other , the anti - correlation will be preserved : we average many negative numbers ( @xmath40 for each lens ) together and still obtain a negative number .",
    "this assumes that the foreground lenses are isolated from each other , and that there is no additional lensing from structures the foreground lenses are aligned with ( i.e. ignores the intrinsic alignment ",
    "shear correlation ) .",
    "we now quantify the effect of averaging over many isolated lenses at a given redshift .",
    "first we assume all lenses have the same mass and consider just the variety of ellipticities .",
    "we average over a population of lens ellipticities , drawing each ellipticity component from a gaussian of width 0.16 , and calculating the absolute ellipticity .",
    "we find that the shear - ellipticity correlation scales roughly as the square of the lens ellipticity .",
    "this implies that the mean shear scales with lens ellipticity .",
    "the shear - ellipticity correlation function , after averaging over this population , is roughly equal to that for a single lens of ellipticity @xmath41 . as expected from the squared dependence , this is slightly higher than the mean absolute ellipticity of the lenses ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we also average over the lens population mass distribution expected for a survey with shear measurements complete to an apparent magnitude limit of 24 in the sdss r filter .",
    "we obtain number densities from @xcite calculated at the lens redshift , down to a limiting mass @xmath43 which corresponds to the magnitude limit .",
    "this limiting mass was determined by ( i ) calculating from the mass function the number of objects per unit volume integrated down to the limiting mass ( ii ) comparing this with number density of observed galaxies derived from combo-17 luminosity functions @xcite , using the numbers in table  1 of @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath44 , which gives a mean mass of @xmath45 .",
    "we investigated the effect of averaging over mass by considering the contribution to @xmath27 for a fixed lens ellipticity . at 4 arcmin",
    "the @xmath27 contribution averaged over mass is equal to that for a single lens of mass @xmath46 .",
    "this is bigger than the mean mass of the objects because the dependence of the shear - ellipticity correlation is roughly @xmath47 at this angular scale .    the thick solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : cf cosmic shear ] shows the contribution to the ellipticity correlation function after averaging over mass and ellipticity .",
    "it is slightly more shallow than the lines at constant mass since larger masses dominate at larger angular separations due to their smaller concentration parameters .",
    "this is slightly amplified by the fact that larger ellipticities contribute more at larger radii , and larger ellipticities have a larger shear - ellipticity correlation .    to estimate the dependence on lens profile we repeat the above calculations using a population of sie lenses , with velocity dispersions calculated analytically from @xmath29 .",
    "the resulting contribution is shown by the thin solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : cf cosmic shear ] , and is much higher than the nfw result , likely mainly because of the shallower density profile at large radii ( @xmath48 instead of @xmath49 ) .",
    "all of the above calculations assume a lens redshift of @xmath50 and a background redshift of @xmath51 .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : z dep ] show how the signal at 4 arcmin depends on lens and source redshift .",
    "in general the signal is larger at lower lens redshifts and decreases rapidly to zero as the lens approaches the source .",
    "we expect the signal to be smaller as the lens approaches the source because of the geometry of gravitational lensing .",
    "the fact that it drops so quickly , and in fact for @xmath52 rises slightly first , is because at higher redshifts a magnitude limited survey contains more massive objects , that are more effective at lensing . at low redshift",
    ", galaxies have a larger angular size so for a given angular separation we start to probe into the center of the nfw profile where the profile slope is more constant with radius .",
    "however , on averaging over redshift the lower redshift contribution would become smaller since there will be fewer objects in the light cone .",
    "also there is little cosmic shear signal at low redshift so these galaxies could be ignored .",
    "finally we investigated the effect of survey depth , and find that for a given angular scale , fixing @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the signal was around a factor 2.5 larger if @xmath53 , and a factor approximately 4 smaller if @xmath54 , depending on the extrapolation of the luminosity function .",
    "this is to be expected because deeper surveys contain many less massive objects .",
    "in figs .  [ fig : cf cosmic shear ] and  [ fig : z dep ] we compare the galaxy - galaxy lensing contribution to the ellipticity correlation function with that from cosmic shear cross - correlation tomography . we calculate the non - linear matter power spectrum as a function of redshift using camb  @xcite with the halofit @xcite option .",
    "this is converted into the cosmic shear cross power spectrum using equations from @xcite .",
    "we assume delta function redshift distributions corresponding to the galaxy - galaxy lens and source redshifts .    the cosmic shear correlation function is flatter than the galaxy - galaxy lensing contribution above @xmath55 the galaxy - galaxy lensing contribution is smaller than the cosmic shear signal for nfw lenses",
    ". however it must be much smaller than the cosmic shear signal if it is not to interfere with cosmological parameter analyses .    to illustrate this we also show the change in cosmic shear signal for a small change ( @xmath56 ) in the equation of state of dark energy , @xmath0 , leaving the other cosmological parameters ( including @xmath57 ) fixed .",
    "the galaxy - galaxy lensing contribution is not negligible below 4 arcmin for nfw galaxy profiles .",
    "we find that this scale will strongly depend on the lens profile since it is greater than 30 arcmin for sie profiles .",
    "we assumed that the lens ellipticity is the same size and orientation as the mass ellipticity .",
    "this is consistent with measurement attempts @xcite , but the signal to noise is low . if the mass ellipticity were a factor @xmath32 smaller than the light then this would simply scale the galaxy - galaxy lensing contribution by @xmath32 .",
    "if there is a misalignment then the effective @xmath32 on stacking would be a first approximation to the change .",
    "@xcite consider a more sophisticated alignment model which can reduce the signal by a factor of roughly three .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether the contribution is increased or reduced on considering clustering of the lens galaxies .",
    "further , it is not clear whether deviations from ellipsoidal symmetry of the lens ( such as substructures ) would average out . a rough comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig : cf cosmic shear ] with @xcite ( table 2 ) indicates that at 1 arcminute the galaxy - galaxy nfw lensing contribution is a significant fraction of the total shear - intrinsic alignment correlation , whereas at 10 arcmin the shear - intrinsic alignment correlation is dominated by tidal alignments .",
    "note that this comparison is only approximate since @xcite integrate over lens redshift .",
    "fortunately it may be relatively easy to remove the galaxy - galaxy lensing contribution using the characteristic tangential nature of galaxy - galaxy lensing .",
    "for example the ellipticity two - point function could be measured as a function of two dimensional separation @xmath58 , where the position angle @xmath59 is measured from the major axis of the foreground lens .",
    "the galaxy ellipticity and profile could then be fitted simultaneously with extracting the cosmic shear two point function .",
    "alternatively one could use the method of @xcite , which uses the redshift signature of the effect .",
    "also @xcite suggest removing the most luminous galaxies in the lower redshift slice .",
    "this effect should also ultimately be taken into account for higher order statistics of cosmic shear , since they probe smaller scales than the two - point statistic ( see * ? ? ? * for a calculation for the three point function ) .",
    "furthermore the galaxy - galaxy flexion signal could be a bigger contaminant of cosmic flexion because the latter is more sensitive than cosmic shear at small angular scales .",
