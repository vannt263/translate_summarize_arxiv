    "the past two decades have witnessed a dramatic development of quantum metrology  @xcite , which is rooted in the theory of quantum parameter estimation .",
    "the estimation of unknown parameters plays an important role in physics and engineering . by taking advantage of quantum resources such as entanglement and squeezing",
    ", quantum metrology promises a higher precision in parameter estimation than its classical counterpart .",
    "therefore many practical applications have been suggested to reap this benefit , including the detection of gravitational radiation  @xcite , quantum frequency standards  @xcite , and quantum imaging  @xcite .",
    "quantum parameter estimation usually involves schemes for optimally estimating properties of quantum states or processes .",
    "the problem of parameter estimation for quantum processes can be treated as a task of optimal estimation of quantum states , where the states under investigation are the parameterized output states of the quantum processes .",
    "the estimation of unitary quantum processes is of interest and has been investigated in many different setups  @xcite . in a realistic scenario ,",
    "the system evolution is unavoidably accompanied by some noise and the quantum process is treated as a general trace - preserving completely positive map , which is also called a quantum channel .",
    "the optimal estimation of a general one - parameter channel has been studied and some optimal estimation schemes have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "these schemes mainly consist of the identification of an optimal input state and an optimal estimator of the output state . in this paper , we restrict our investigation to unitary quantum processes , for simplicity , and concentrate only on finding the optimal input states and the corresponding accuracy limits .",
    "it is well known that the inverse of fisher information gives the lower bound of the accuracy limit .",
    "fisher information characterizes the amount of information about the true value of a parameter that can be extracted from a probability distribution .",
    "quantum fisher information ( qfi ) , which is a key concept in quantum metrology , is defined by maximizing the fisher information over all possible measurements  @xcite .",
    "the quantum cramer - rao theorem asserts that the precision is bounded from below by the inverse of the qfi  @xcite .",
    "due to its great importance in quantum metrology and parameter estimation , the qfi has attracted a lot of attentions  @xcite . however , analytical expressions for the qfi are difficult to obtain in most cases .",
    "the qfi associated with a state  @xmath0  for a parameter  @xmath1 is defined as  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 stands for trace and @xmath4 is the symmetric logarithmic derivative operator , which is determined by  @xmath5 .",
    "consider a general unitary parametrization process  @xmath6  for an initial pure state  @xmath7 , with the time - independent hamiltonian  @xmath8  depending on a parameter  @xmath1 , the qfi is simply connected with the variance of a hermitian operator  @xmath9 in  @xmath7 , that is  @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a hermitian operator associated with the parametrization .",
    "it has been shown that the variance of an hermitian operator  @xmath9 is maximized when the initial state  @xmath7  is an equally weighted superposition of the eigenvectors  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 , which correspond to the maximum and minimum eigenvalues  @xmath14  and  @xmath15  of the operator  @xmath9 , respectively  @xcite ; i.e. , @xmath16 where  @xmath17  is an arbitrary relative phase , and the maximal qfi ( mqfi ) is  @xcite @xmath18 here @xmath7 is the optimal input state .",
    "the convexity of the qfi guarantees that the mqfi is attained by a pure state rather than mixed states  @xcite .",
    "an important observation is that @xmath7 can be a maximal entangled state for a many - body system , e.g. , ghz states , or n00n states .",
    "this is consistent with previous research where maximal entangled states are optimal input states to enhance the estimation precision .",
    "previous research has mainly focused on the estimation of an overall multiplicative factor of a hamiltonian  @xmath8  @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "the  @xmath9 operator is easily obtained as @xmath19  @xcite . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "_ studied a general hamiltonian parameter estimation problem where the parameter does not appear as an overall multiplicative factor .",
    "their study extends the quantum metrology to a more general case . based on their work",
    ", we offered another approach to get the qfi for unitary parametrization processes in  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the qfi is related to the spectral decomposition of the initial state and the @xmath9 operator of the parametrization process @xmath20 where the superoperator",
    "@xmath21 denotes a @xmath22th - order nested commutator operation , @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath1 is a multiplicative factor , as in the mach - zehnder interferometer setup , @xmath24@xcite , where @xmath25 is independent of the parameter to be estimated , the summation vanishes , and only the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) contributes .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a general unitary parametrization process governed by an su(2 ) hamiltonian in the form of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a time - independent function of the parameter and @xmath28 is the generator of su(2 ) algebra .",
    "this hamiltonian covers many interesting applications in physics .",
    "we derive the analytical expression of the mqfi and find that it can be divided into two parts ; one is quadratic in time @xmath29 due to the dependence of the norm @xmath30 on the parameter @xmath1 , and the other oscillates with time @xmath29 because of the dependence of the direction @xmath31 on the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , we apply the theoretical expression in three practical examples .",
    "the first two examples undergo time - independent su(2 ) parametrization , and the third one is subjected to time - dependent su(2 ) parametrization .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sec",
    "ii , we derive the @xmath9 operator and the mqfi for a general su(2 ) hamiltonian . in sec iii ,",
    "three applications of the theoretical result are listed . the first two",
    "are governed by time - independent su(2 ) hamiltonians .",
    "we discuss the corresponding mqfi for the estimated parameters . in the third application , we further study the parameter estimation with a time - dependent su(2 ) hamiltonian and give the expression of the @xmath9 operator and the mqfi .",
    "finally , we give the discussion and conclusion in sec iv .",
    "in this section , we investigate the @xmath9 operator and the mqfi for a general su(2 ) parametrization process .",
    "assume that the hamiltonian takes the form of @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the generator of su(2 ) algebra and @xmath34 is a time - independent parametric curve in the parameter space .",
    "we denote the derivative of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath1 as @xmath35 where we define the velocity @xmath36 , which denotes the change of @xmath27 over the parameter space of @xmath1 , including both of the change of @xmath37 over @xmath1 and the change of the unit vector @xmath38 over @xmath1 .",
    "thus the velocity @xmath39 can be decomposed as  @xmath40 , with the radial velocity @xmath41 and the transverse velocity  @xmath42  reading as    [ eq : velocities ] @xmath43 @xmath44    utilizing the commutation relation for su(2 ) algebra @xmath45=i(\\mathbf{a\\times b})\\cdot\\mathbf{j } , $ ] the first two commutators in eq .",

    "it is shown that both @xmath48 and @xmath49 are eigen operators of the superoperator @xmath50 , i.e. ,    [ eq : commutator2 ] @xmath51 @xmath52    where @xmath53 . by plugging eq .   into eq .  , we have @xmath54 and inserting the first two commutators in eq .   into eq .  , we find that @xmath55 according to eq .  , we have that @xmath56 , latexmath:[$\\mathbf{r\\times v}=    therefore , @xmath9 can be further written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 the three terms in eq .",

    "equation ( [ eq : maxfisher1 ] ) shows that the mqfi can be divided into two parts .",
    "the first part is quadratic in time @xmath29 and is proportional to the square of the radial velocity @xmath41 .",
    "the second part oscillates with time  @xmath29  and is proportional to the ratio of the square of the transverse velocity @xmath42 to the square of @xmath65 . according to eq .",
    ", this ratio is equal to the square of the derivative @xmath66 .",
    "thus the quadratic term is due to the dependence of the norm @xmath30 on the parameter @xmath1 , while the oscillation term is due to the dependence of the direction @xmath67 on @xmath1 .",
    "when  @xmath29  is small , we can expand eq .   in  @xmath29  to the second order , and the mqfi",
    "is simplified to @xmath68=4j^{2}t^{2}\\mathbf{v}^{2}.\\ ] ] that is , the mqfi grows quadratically with time @xmath29 and depends only on the norm of @xmath39 .",
    "if the change of @xmath37 over the parameter space is 0 , i.e. , @xmath69 , then the mqfi is reduced to @xmath70 in this case , the mqfi always oscillates with the time so that its value is bounded . at the time",
    "points @xmath71 , the mqfi reaches the optimal value , @xmath72",
    "in this section , we apply the theoretical expression in three practical examples .",
    "the dynamics of the first two examples are governed by time - independent su(2 ) hamiltonians , and the third one is governed by a time - dependent su(2 ) hamiltonian .",
    "also note that the hamiltonians may depend on several parameters , and we only consider the single parameter estimation in this paper , i.e. , we suppose that other parameters are known when we estimate a specific parameter .",
    "_ case 1_. let us consider the hamiltonian , , with @xmath27 in the explicit form in the spherical coordinates , @xmath73 where @xmath74 represents the amplitude of the external magnetic field and @xmath1 , @xmath75 denotes the direction of the field .",

    "the velocity vector is readily obtained as @xmath76 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath77 . according to eq .  , the mqfi over @xmath1 is @xmath78 and when @xmath79 , @xmath80 reaches its optimal value of @xmath81 .",
