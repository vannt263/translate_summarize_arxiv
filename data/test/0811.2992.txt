    "more stars , not related to star formation , were recognized and excluded according to their color indices based on iras and msx photometry .",
    "the remaining 187 objects may be considered as potential ysos .",
    "evolutionary status was confirmed for 14 of the brightest objects from this list by obtaining their far red spectra ( corbally & straiys 2008 ) .",
    "more suspected ysos were confirmed to be h@xmath1 emission stars by the iphas survey ( witham et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the distribution of ysos in the area exhibits evident clustering in the darkest dust clouds .",
    "some groups of objects coincide with known star - forming regions ( w3 , w4 , w5 , ldn 1355/1358 at su cas ) , with the two centers of the cam ob1 association ( gl490 and sh2 - 205 ) , and with the infrared clusters described by bica et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) and froebrich et al .",
    "( 2007a ) .",
    "the grouping of objects within a few arcminutes around the object gl490 in @xmath26-band images was first described by hodapp ( 1990 , 1994 ) .",
    "however , clustering of infrared objects in the direction of dense dust clouds does not mean that we are observing a real cluster : distant heavily reddened k  m giants may imitate it as well ( straiys & laugalys 2008 ) .",
    "the suspected ysos were attributed to the gould belt , the cam ob1 and the perseus arm layers on the basis of radial velocities of the associated co clouds .",
    "42 objects were found belonging to the cam ob1 star - forming region in the local arm . in figure 6",
    "these objects are plotted in a @xmath22@xmath23 vs. @xmath23@xmath24 diagram together with other young objects of the same sfr : o  b3 stars of cam ob1 , irregular variables and h@xmath1 emission stars .",
    "in reality , more young objects are expected above the intrinsic t tauri line but they are difficult to identify among thousands of other stars with only 2mass photometry available .",
    "photometric data in the mid- and far - infrared would be helpful .",
    "the young objects for which fluxes have been measured in the 8100 @xmath13 m wavelength range , can be classified in the lada ( 1987 ) classes or the robitaille et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) evolutionary stages .",
    "we classified about 40 objects observed by iras and/or by msx .",
    "the spectral energy distribution curves ( seds ) in the @xmath27 vs. @xmath28 coordinates were used ( straiys & laugalys 2007b , 2008 ) .",
    "the object gl490 is the brightest among all , and its sed is typical for a class i object with a maximum at 5060 @xmath13 m .",
    "the milky way in camelopardalis ( including the nearby areas of cassiopeia and perseus ) was until a decade ago among the least investigated regions .",
    "however , recently a number of important studies of stars and interstellar matter in this region have appeared .",
    "this paper is an attempt to put together the results related to star - forming processes in the local spiral arm at the galactic longitudes from 132@xmath0 to 158@xmath0 .",
    "it is evident that this arm is populated by dust and molecular clouds of high density in which star formation takes place .",
    "the clouds may be divided into the gould belt layer at 150300 pc distances from the sun and the cam ob1 association layer at @xmath2900 pc distance . however ,",
    "this division is somewhat ambiguous since in some directions dust distribution across the arm is almost continuous . the largest density is observed in the cam ob1 layer where some cloud clumps ( like tgu  942  p1 ) reach an extinction @xmath16 of up to 25 mag or more .    the presence in the area of tens of young massive stars of spectral classes o  b3 and of supergiants is evidence of a recent star - forming process which lasted about 10 million years .",
    "probably this process continues up to now , since we have succeeded to find in the clouds tens of stars , which photometrically are similar to ysos of classes i  iii .",
    "the most typical yso of class i is gl490 , a massive object in a protostellar evolutionary stage .",
    "the presence of young stars of lower masses in the clouds is also confirmed by identifying about 17 irregular variable and h@xmath1 emission stars .",
    "most probably , new spectral and photometric observations will reveal more t tauri - type stars and related objects in the clouds . in the densest parts of the clouds",
    "more ysos in early evolutionary stages are expected .",
    "the cam ob1 association sometimes is considered as unusual due to its enormous linear extent .",
    "however , the association may be split into three parts  group a at the sh2 - 202 and vdb14 + 15 nebulae , group b at the sh2 - 205 nebula , and a third group formed by the cluster ngc 1502 .",
    "then both the a and b parts will become of normal sizes , 7090 pc in diameter .",
    "both groups contain o  b3 stars , supergiants , h@xmath1 emission stars and suspected young infrared objects .",
