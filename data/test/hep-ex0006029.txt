    "the experimental search for dibaryons continues since over 20 years ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the dibaryons considered couple usually to two nucleons and reflect their symmetry . therefore , such dibaryons have estimated decay widths from several mev up to a few hundreds mev . however , their production cross sections in reactions involving nucleons and pions are small and the spectra are dominated by a large background",
    ". this has lead to contradictory results and the dibaryons decaying directly into two nucleons are not unequivocally established .",
    "we consider a new class of dibaryons ",
    "supernarrow dibaryons ( snds ) , the decay of which into two nucleons is forbidden by the pauli exclusion principle @xcite .",
    "such dibaryons with masses @xmath11 , where @xmath12(@xmath13 ) is the nucleon ( pion ) mass , can decay into two nucleons , by emitting a third particle , normally a photon .",
    "the decay widths of these dibaryons are predicted to be @xmath14 kev @xcite .    in the framework of the mit bag model , mulders _",
    "@xcite calculated the masses of different dibaryons , in particular , @xmath15-decoupled dibaryons .",
    "these dibaryons @xmath16 gev ) and @xmath17 gev ) correspond to the states @xmath18 and @xmath19 forbidden in the @xmath15 channel .",
    "however , the masses of these dibaryon exceed the pion production threshold .",
    "therefore , these dibaryons can decay into the @xmath20 channel and their decay widths are larger than 1 mev .    using the chiral soliton model ,",
    "kopeliovich @xcite predicted that the masses of @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath15-decoupled dibaryons exceeded the two nucleon mass by 60 and 90 mev , respectively .",
    "these values are lower than the pion production threshold .    in the framework of",
    "the canonically quantized biskyrmion model krupovnickas _ al . _",
    "@xcite obtained an indication of the existence of one dibaryon with j = t=0 and two dibaryons with j = t=1 with masses smaller than @xmath23 .",
    "all these results are model calculations of very limited predictive power and provide just a motivation to look for snds . in the following we summerize the experimental attempts to look for such dibaryons so far .    in ref .",
    "@xcite dibaryons with exotic quantum numbers were searched for in the process @xmath24 .",
    "the experiment was performed with a proton beam from the jinr phasotron at an energy of about 216 mev .",
    "the energy spectrum of the photons emitted at @xmath25 was measured and showed two peaks .",
    "this behavior of the photon energy spectrum was interpreted as a signature of an exotic dibaryon resonance with a mass of about 1956 mev and possible isospin @xmath26 . however , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite make the possibility of a production of dibaryons with @xmath26 in this reaction questionable .",
    "so , additional careful studies of the reaction @xmath24 are needed to more correctly understand the nature of the observed state .    an analysis of the uppsala proton - proton bremsstrahlung data @xcite looking for the presence of a dibaryon in the mass range from 1900 to 1960 mev gave only upper limits of 10 and 3 nb for the dibaryon production cross section at proton beam energies of 200 and 310 mev , respectively .",
    "this result agrees with the expected values of the cross section obtained at the conditions of this experiment in the framework of the model of dibaryon production and decay suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and does not contradict the data of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our previous studies",
    "@xcite we investigated the reaction @xmath27 in order to search for snds . in this process",
    "snds can be produced only if the nucleons in the deuteron overlap sufficiently , such that a six - quark state with deuteron quantum numbers can be formed .",
    "then , an interaction of a meson or another particle with this state can change its quantum numbers so that a metastable state is formed .",
    "the experiment was carried out at the proton beam of the linear accelerator of inr using the two - arm spectrometer tams . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nucleons and the deuteron from the decay of snd into @xmath28 and @xmath29 have to be emitted into a narrow angular cone with respect to the direction of the dibaryon . if a dibaryon decays mainly into two nucleons , then the expected angular cone of the emitted nucleons is about @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , a detection of the scattered proton in coincidence with the proton ( or the deuteron ) from the decay of particle @xmath31 at correlated angles allowed to suppress effectively the contribution of the background processes and to increase the relative contribution of a possible snd production . as a result ,",
    "two narrow peaks in missing mass spectra have been observed at @xmath321905 and 1924 mev with widths equal to the experimental resolution ( @xmath33 ) and with 4.8 and 4.9 standard deviations ( sd ) , respectively .",
    "the analysis of the angular distributions of the charged particles ( @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) from the decay of particle @xmath31 showed that the peak found at 1905 mev most likely corresponds to a snd with isotopic spin equal to 1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite arguments were presented that the resonance at @xmath321924 mev could be snd , too .",
    "in this paper we present a new study of the @xmath27 reaction at the linear accelerator of inr with 305 mev proton beam using the spectrometer tams where the proton and deuteron from the decays @xmath36 and @xmath37 are measured in coincidence with the scattered proton .    in the experiment , cd@xmath38 and @xmath39c were used as targets .",
    "the scattered proton was detected in the left arm of the spectrometer tams at the angle @xmath40 .",
    "the second charged particle ( either @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) was detected in the right arm by three telescopes located at @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "a trigger was generated by four - fold coincidences of the two @xmath44 detector signals of the left arm combined with those of any telescope of the right arm .",
    "the events contained information about time - of - flights and full energies of two particles detected in coincidence in the left and right arms of the spectrometer .",
    "the energy resolution was 4 mev ( 7 mev ) for the left ( right ) arm .",
    "a time - of - flight resolution better than 0.5 ns was achieved .",
    "each valid event including two time - of - flights and two energies were stored event by event and then analyzed off line .",
    "an off - line identification of different particles was performed by means of their energies @xmath45 and time - of - flights @xmath46 . in this way",
    ", protons and other charged particles were identified via characteristic loci observed in two dimensional diagrams of time - of - flight versus energy . as an example",
    "such an experimental @xmath47 distribution for the right arm detector at @xmath48 is displayed in fig .",
    "1 . this figure shows the band of proton events , presenting the dependence of the proton time - of - flight on its energy , and a spot corresponding to the deuteron from the elastic @xmath6 scattering .",
    "several software cuts have been applied to the mass spectra .",
    "the energy of the scattered proton was limited by an interval of @xmath49 mev , that corresponded to the interval of measured dibaryon masses @xmath50 mev / c@xmath10 . in order to suppress the background from the reaction @xmath51 , where @xmath52 stands for the unobserved particles , in @xmath53 spectra , we omitted events with a deuteron energy higher than the energy of the elastically scattered deuteron in the @xmath54 reaction at the given angles . for the @xmath3 spectra the energy interval for the proton from the snd decay was determined by the kinematics of the decay of @xmath31 into the @xmath28 channel .",
    "this interval was equal to @xmath55 mev .",
    "such a cut allows to suppress essentially the contribution from the reaction @xmath56 . the main contribution to this reaction at the energy under consideration",
    "is given by one - nucleon pole diagrams when one of the nucleons is a spectator .",
    "these diagrams give the maximum contribution when the kinetic energy of the spectator nucleon approaches zero .",
    "missing mass spectra of @xmath3 and @xmath53 were determined with the expression @xmath57 with the additional condition that the proton from the @xmath36 and the deuteron from the @xmath37 decay were detected in the right arm detector of the tams spectrometer . in this expression @xmath58",

    "2 ) has a peak at the deuteron mass .",
    "this peak corresponds to the elastic @xmath6 scattering .",
    "a measurement of this reaction at different angles of the right and left arms was used to calibrate the spectrometer .",
    "the over all mass resolution of the spectrometer was @xmath64 mev , the angular resolution @xmath65 .",
    "we first consider the @xmath66 reaction .",
    "3a-3c depict the experimental missing mass @xmath3 spectra obtained with the cd@xmath38 and @xmath39c targets , where ( 3a ) , ( 3b ) , and ( 3c ) correspond to a detection of the second proton in the right arm detector at @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the background in these spectra are interpolated by polynomials .",
    "three peaks at @xmath67 , 1926@xmath2 , and 1942@xmath2 mev are clearly visible in these spectra .",
    "the first two of them confirm the values of the dibaryon mass obtained by us earlier @xcite , whereas the resonance at 1942 mev is a new one .",
    "this additional resonance is due to the different kinematical coverage of the new experiment . in this experiment",
    "we could decrease the detection threshold of the scattered proton down to 50 mev giving us a broader acceptance in the missing mass .",
    "the experimental missing mass spectra , obtained with the carbon target , are rather smooth .",
    "this smoothness is caused by both , an essential increase of the contribution of background reactions in the interaction of the proton with the carbon and the fermi motion of the nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "the latter increases essentially the angular cone of the emitted nucleons . in consequence , it is not possible to see peaks of snds on the carbon target . as the experiment with the carbon target resulted in the rather smooth spectra , all structures , appearing in the experiment with the cd@xmath38 target , have to be attributed to an interaction of the proton with the deuteron .    the experimental spectra in figs .",
    "3a-3c are compared with the prediction of the theoretical model of snds @xmath68 production constructed in the one meson exchange approach @xcite and normalized to the values of peaks in fig .",
    "our calculation for the isovector snd @xmath68 with the mass @xmath69=1904 mev showed that the contributions of such a dibaryon to the spectra at angles @xmath70 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 must relate as @xmath71 . for the isoscalar snd @xmath72 one obtains @xmath73 .",
    "the biggest contribution of the snd with @xmath74 mev is expected at @xmath75 . however , the angles @xmath76 were not investigated in this work .",
    "the calculation of the ratio of the contributions to the missing mass spectra at the angles @xmath70 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 gave @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "nucleons from the decay of the snd with @xmath81 mev have a wider angular distribution due to the the higher mass and consequently the higher transverse momenta in the decay @xmath36 according to the calculations with a maximum in the region of @xmath82 . in the region of the angles under consideration here , the contributions of the @xmath83 are expected to behave as @xmath84 . for the snd @xmath72 we have @xmath85 .",
    "all these predictions for the snds are in agreement with our experimental data within the errors .",
    "however , the analysis of the reaction @xmath0 only in the considered angular range does not allow to determine an isotopic spin of the snds .",
    "if the observed states are @xmath15-coupled dibaryons decaying mainly into two nucleons then the expected angular cone size of emitted nucleons must be more than @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , their contributions to the missing mass spectra in fig .",
    "3a-3c would be nearly constant and would not exceed a few events , even assuming that the dibaryon production cross section is equal to that of elastic @xmath6 scattering ( @xmath86b / sr ) .",
    "hence , the peaks found most likely correspond to snds .",
    "the missing mass @xmath53 spectrum of the reaction @xmath87 , for the sum of angles @xmath41 and @xmath42 is shown in fig .",
    "as seen from this figure , the reaction @xmath1 gives a very small contribution to the production of the dibaryons under study .    on the other hand",
    ", it is expected @xcite that isoscalar snds contribute mainly in the @xmath29 and isovector snds in the @xmath28 channels . as the main contribution of the indicated dibaryons",
    "is observed in @xmath88 channel , it is possible to suppose that @xmath89 and all found states are isovector snds .",
    "a more precise conclusion about the value of the isotopic spin of the observed snds could be obtained by the study of the reaction @xmath90 .",
    "the experiment on the snd photoproduction in the process @xmath91 with polarized photons could separate the @xmath92 and @xmath93 states @xcite where @xmath94 is the spin of the snd .",
    "the sum of missing mass spectra of the reaction @xmath0 over angles @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where the contribution of the snds is maximum , is presented in fig .",
    "this spectrum was fitted by a polynomial for the background plus gaussians for the peaks .",
    "the number of standard deviations ( sd ) is then determined from this spectrum as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the number of events above the background curve and @xmath97 is the number of events below this curve .",
    "taking nine points for each peak , we have 6.0 , 7.0 , and 6.3 sd for the resonances at 1904 , 1926 , and 1942 mev , respectively .",
    "the widths of these resonances are equal to the experimental resolution of @xmath64 mev .",
    "an additional information about the nature of the observed states has been obtained by studying the missing mass @xmath4 spectra of the reaction @xmath0 .",
    "if the state found is a dibaryon decaying mainly into two nucleons then @xmath98 is a neutron and the mass @xmath4 is equal to the neutron mass @xmath99 . if the value of @xmath4 , obtained from the experiment , differs essentially from @xmath99 then @xmath89 and we have the additional indication that the observed dibaryon is snd .",
    "the simulation of the missing @xmath4 mass spectra for the reaction @xmath0 has been performed assuming that the snd decayed as @xmath100 through the two - nucleon singlet state @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "such a decay is characterized in the rest frame by a narrow peak near the maximum photon energy in the probability distribution of the dibaryon decay over an emitted photon energy . as a result of this simulation , in the missing @xmath4 spectra three narrow peaks at @xmath102 , 987 , and 1003 mev",
    "have been predicted .",
    "these peaks correspond to the isovector snds with the masses 1904 , 1926 , and 1942 mev , respectively .",
    "the result of this simulation without the influence of the detector resolution is shown in fig .",
    "6a shows the @xmath4 mass spectrum when the proton from the snd decay @xmath103 is emitted into the whole allowed angular region .",
    "the acceptance of the detectors cuts into the widths of these peaks .",
    "the missing @xmath4 mass spectra , taking into account the acceptance of the detectors at the angles 34@xmath104 and 36@xmath104 , is presented in fig .",
    "the experimental resolutions widen these peaks to @xmath105 mev .",
    "5b depicts the sum of the missing mass @xmath4 spectra for the angles @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "as is seen from this figure , besides the peak at the neutron mass , which is caused by the process @xmath56 , peaks are observed at @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 mev .",
    "hence , for all states under study , we have @xmath89 in support of the assumption that the dibaryons found are snds .    it should be noted that the peak at @xmath109 mev corresponds to the resonance found in ref .",
    "@xcite and was attributed to an exotic baryon state @xmath110 below the @xmath111 threshold . in that work",
    ", the authors found altogether three such states with masses 1004 , 1044 , and 1094 mev .",
    "this is not in contradiction to our interpretation , since in principle snd could decay according to @xmath112 .",
    "the possibility of the production of @xmath113-coupled dibaryons was considered in @xcite .",
    "if the exotic baryon states decay into @xmath114 then they would contribute to the compton scattering on the nucleon .",
    "however , the analysis @xcite of the existing experimental data on this process excludes @xmath110 as intermediate states in the compton scattering on the nucleon .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was assumed that these states belong to totally antisymmetric @xmath115-plet of the spin - flavor @xmath116 group .",
    "such a @xmath110 can transit into a nucleon only if two quarks from the @xmath110 participate in the interaction @xcite .",
    "then the simplest decay of @xmath110 with the masses 1004 and 1044 mev would be @xmath117 .",
    "this conjecture could be checked , in particular , by studying the reactions @xmath118 or @xmath119 at a photon energy close to 800 mev .",
    "taking into account the mentioned connection between the snds and the resonancelike states @xmath98 , it is possible to assume that the peaks , observed in @xcite at 1004 and 1044 mev , are not exotic baryons , but they are the resonancelike states @xmath89 caused by the existence and decay of the snds with the masses 1942 and 1982 mev , respectively",
    ". such @xmath98 would be not real resonances and can not give contribution to the compton scattering on the nucleon .",
    "the result of the study of the reaction @xmath0 is that three narrow peaks at 1904 , 1926 , and 1942 mev have been observed in the missing mass @xmath3 spectra .",
    "the analysis of the angular distributions of the protons from the decay of the @xmath88 states and the data of the reaction @xmath120 showed that the peaks found can be explained as a manifestation of the isovector snds , the decay of which into two nucleons is forbidden by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the observation of the peaks in the missing mass @xmath4 spectra at 966 , 985 , and 1003 mev is an additional confirmation that the dibaryons found are the snds .",
