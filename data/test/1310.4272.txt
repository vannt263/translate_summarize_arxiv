    "an important concept in condensed matter physics is that of an order parameter ( op ) , introduced by lev landau in the last century to describe the transition to the superconducting state .",
    "interestingly , one of landau s first proposals of an order parameter was the supercurrent , also suggested to exist in the microscopic superconducting ground state of felix bloch  @xcite .",
    "these ideas were soon dismissed since a spontaneous circulating supercurrent increases the kinetic energy . in this letter",
    "we find an excited but stable state with supercurrents , containing flow and counter flow in the layers , even without the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "this is a skyrmion state found to exist in a layered superconductor described by a two - component op .",
    "the decay of the skyrmion state into other configurations of lower free energy is prevented by its topological stability , which gives rise to an energy gap since it lies above the homogeneous state .",
    "the skyrmion state breaks the time reversal symmetry and we find that the very weak magnetic field , produced by the spontaneously circulating supercurrents , determines the value of the gap above the homogeneous state .",
    "the gap above the ground state , the topological stability and the unusual magnetic order that breaks the time reversal symmetry found here leads us to suggest that the pseudogap of the layered superconductors is indeed a skyrmion state .",
    "we derive the op and the local magnetic field associated to the skyrmion state from the _ first order equations _ ( foe ) instead of the second order variational equations .",
    "interestingly a. a. abrikosov @xcite , used the foe to discover the vortex lattice instead of the second order ginzburg - landau ( gl ) variational equations .",
    "the gl free energy only sorts among the possible vortex lattice the one with minimal energy .",
    "later the foe were rediscovered by e. bogomolny  @xcite in the context of string theory and shown to solve exactly the gl second order equations for a particular value of the coupling constant .",
    "the seiberg - witten equations , which also describe topological excitations , namely four dimensional monopoles  @xcite , are foe that belong to the same family of the abrikosov - bogomolny ( ab ) equations . in this family ,",
    "the foe determine the op and the vector potential associated to topological excitations .",
    "in this letter we obtain the topological solutions ( skyrmions ) associated to another set of equations that belong to this family that lives in the three - dimensional euclidean space  @xcite .",
    "the existence of topological solutions for the two - component gl theory was pointed out long ago  @xcite , through a mapping into a nonlinear o(3 ) sigma model .",
    "recently skyrmion solutions were obtained from the second order equations of the two - component gl theory , but only in the two - dimensional limit , due to an uniaxial symmetry along the direction of an applied field  @xcite . here",
    "we obtain skyrmions as truly three - dimensional topological solutions of the foe of the two - component gl theory , applied to a stack of layers and without the presence of an applied magnetic field .",
    "we find that the skyrmions form an excited gapped state regardless of the shape of the condensate energy .",
    "in his original work t. skyrme made protons and neutrons stable by association to a topologically non - trivial solution of the sigma model  @xcite , the skyrmion , that represents a configuration with particle - like properties .",
    "skyrmions are found in many condensed matter systems with an inner structure constructed over a physical op .",
    "skyrmions were reported in the quantized hall effect  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates  @xcite and superfluid@xmath1he - a  @xcite . in the antiferromagnet la@xmath2cu@xmath3li@xmath4o@xmath5",
    "@xcite the cuo@xmath2 layers are modified by li atoms , which are dopants that frustrate the original neel state , leading to a magnetic state made of skyrmions .",
    "recently skyrmions were found to form a crystalline order  @xcite in the helimagnet mnsi  @xcite and also in the doped semiconductor fe@xmath3co@xmath4si  @xcite .",
    "the present skyrmion state generates a magnetic field @xmath6 between the layers due to the superficial supercurrent @xmath7 circulating in the layers . in this letter",
    "we assume a tetragonal symmetric skyrmion state , described by a unit cell of size @xmath8 .",
    "we find here that the skyrmion state exists around the minimum of the magnetic energy density , @xmath9 , stored between layers , which takes place for a special value of the ratio between the unit cell size and the distance between consecutive layers , @xmath10 .",
    "surprisingly our theoretically found ratio @xmath11 coincides with the experimentally obtained ratio @xmath12  @xcite , where @xmath13 is the distance between dopants within a copper - oxygen layer . according to r.p .",
    "roeser et al .",
    "@xcite the tetragonal structure set by @xmath13 at maximum doping acts as a resonator that we claim here to be that of the skyrmion state , namely , @xmath14 .",
    "indeed since the discovery of stripe order in the cuprates , charge , magnetism and superconductivity are believed to coexist in geometrical periodic arrangements @xcite .",
    "the skyrmion lattice associated to d and s wave symmetrical op are shown in fig .",
    "( [ currents ] ) .",
    "there are two cores of circulating currents for d wave ( red ) , with centers in the middle of the unit cell sides , while for s wave ( black ) there is only one core centered at the corners of the unit cell . in both cases , there is no net circulation in the unit cell , and yet there is a single sense of intense circulation set in the cores .",
    "as seen from above a layer , e.g. the plane of fig .",
    "( [ currents ] ) , the @xmath6 stream lines sink into these cores to re - emerge from below , and pierce the unit cell a second time , forming closed loops . besides these field stream lines most densely concentrated in the cores , there exists other ones that fully crosses the stack of layers , in the opposite direction relative to the sinking ones ,",
    "never to come back again , like in an infinitely extended solenoid .",
    "the skyrmion cores are small , concentrated pockets of opposite field with 9.4@xmath15 and 5.3@xmath15 of the total cell area , for d and s wave respectively . in the pseudogap state",
    "the fermi surface breaks apart leading to the emergence of electron pockets for hole - doped cuprates @xcite .",
    "this transformation of the fermi surface has been suggested to be a consequence of a new periodicity that sets in the system @xcite .",
    "we find strong similarities between the electron - hole duality and the flow - counter flow circulating supercurrents of the skyrmion state .",
    "the skyrmion s topological charge is obtained by integration over a single layer , at @xmath16 for @xmath17 . @xmath18 and one obtains that q=-2 and -1 for the d and s wave states , respectively , in agreement with the plotted solutions of fig.([currents ] ) .",
    "clearly the time reversal symmetry , ( @xmath19 ) , is broken by the skyrmions .",
    "the normal state of the underdoped cuprate superconductors is unusual because it reveals a gap , the so - called pseudogap  @xcite that breaks the time - reversal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the pseudogap as a skyrmion state leads to an estimate of the number of carriers that condense in the pseudogap of the cuprate superconductors , @xmath20 .",
    "we obtain here that @xmath21 , or @xmath22 of the cooper pair density in the cuprates .",
    "two - component op theories are being considered to describe properties of the high - temperature layered superconductors  @xcite and only a multi - component op theory can yield a time reversal broken state  @xcite . according to volovik and",
    "gorkov a state described by an op with broken time reversal symmetry must have an accompanying magnetic order  @xcite .",
    "for this reason there has been an intense search for the accompanying magnetic order associated to the pseudogap , and proposals have been made to explain it , such as by c. m. varma  @xcite , based on microscopic orbital currents . indeed polarized neutron diffraction experiments  @xcite indicate a magnetic order below the pseudogap , but nmr / nqr @xcite and @xmath0sr @xcite experiments set a very restrictive limit to _ the maximum magnetic field _ inside the superconductor , hereafter called @xmath23 .",
    "we obtain here that the gap density of the skyrmion state is @xmath24 , where @xmath23 is given in gauss . for the single - layer cuprates",
    "the inter - layer distance is @xmath25 . to fix ideas we take that @xmath26 , thus below the above experimental thresholds , and obtain for the gap density that @xmath27 .",
    "recall that the bcs superconducting state which lies below the normal state and has a gap density of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the energy required to break a single cooper pair and @xmath30 represents the density of available cooper pairs , namely @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 being the electronic density and the fermi energy , respectively .",
    "then one obtains that the gap density for metals is @xmath34 since @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . a similar estimate for the cuprates",
    "gives that the gap density is @xmath38 , considering that the gap is ten times larger than that of metals , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , since there are a few cooper pairs  @xcite occupying the coherence length volume , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "our estimate of @xmath20 follows from the assumption that the skyrmion gap ( pseudogap ) is equal to the superconducting gap .",
    "then the large wavelength limit of the kinetic energy ( eq.([gap ] ) ) reveals the pseudogap density for the cuprates , since @xmath44 and by assumption , @xmath45 .",
    "we consider the scenario of a layered superconductor above its critical temperature t@xmath46 such that its free energy density is widely dominated by the kinetic and field density energies over the condensate energy , to the point that this last one can be neglected .",
    "notice that the presence of a condensate energy will not affect the stability of the skyrmions , which is of topological nature .",
    "then the free energy density , is just the sum of the kinetic energy and field energy densities  @xcite , @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the bulk volume .",
    "there is minimal coupling , @xmath51 , and the local magnetic field is @xmath52 .",
    "we solve the resulting variational equations for a set of equally spaced superconducting layers , separated by @xmath10 , with metallic filling between them .",
    "the layers carry a superficial current @xmath53 , which must also be determined .",
    "we do this by the first order equation ( foe ) method , which solves ampre s law exactly , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and the ginzburg - landau equation , @xmath56 approximately , meaning that , instead , we solve exactly the so - called integrated equation , @xmath57 , which can also be expressed as @xmath58 .",

    "thus for fields that satisfy the foe , eq.([kin2 ] ) becomes :",
    "@xmath64 introducing eq.([kin3 ] ) into the integrated equation gives that @xmath65 , which is exactly solved for the following choice of integration constant : @xmath66 thus one obtains that , @xmath67 \\label{fenop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eqs.([foe1 ] ) and ( [ foe2 ] ) are nonlinear and must be solved iteratively .",
    "the first one determines @xmath68 while the second one , @xmath6 .",
    "we solve them in the lowest order approximation , that is , firstly @xmath68 is obtained from eq.([foe1 ] ) in the absence of @xmath6 , and , next , @xmath6 is determined from eq.([foe2 ] ) , using the known op solution .",
    "the success of this lowest approximation relies on the fact that @xmath6 must be very weak , such that no further iterations of the foe are needed . for the case of a single layer",
    ", the solution of @xmath69 is , for @xmath70 , @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",

    "there is a fundamental difference between _ single _ and _ multiple _ layer solutions described by eq.([sls ] ) and ( [ mls ] ) , respectively . for a single layer @xmath85 , since @xmath86 .",
    "in fact for the single layer eq.([cconst ] ) does not apply to determine @xmath87 . for a stack of layers @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "thus the stack of layers behaves similarly to a solenoid , which renders @xmath90 , and only @xmath91 .",
    "the low component of eq.([mls ] ) vanishes in the middle plane ( @xmath92 ) , and there @xmath93 .",
