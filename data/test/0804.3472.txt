    "understanding the chemical history of heavy elements (  metals \" ) in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies is an important , but difficult undertaking .",
    "because refractory elements are found to be depleted from the gas phase ( locked into grains ) , they provide a substantial reservoir of coolants in the solid - state phase .",
    "interstellar grain surfaces are believed to furnish formation sites for molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath1 ) , which is both a coolant and the starting point for a rich cloud chemistry .",
    "grains also provide a critical transfer mechanism for reprocessing uv / o starlight into far - infrared and sub - mm emission from interstellar molecular clouds and high - redshift galaxies . in the high - redshift universe , the first dust grains may influence the thermodynamics of the primordial gas and thereby control rates of star formation .",
    "recent observations of dust grains at high redshift have been puzzling in the context of their formation .",
    "several observations of damped ly@xmath2 systems ( pettini 1994 ; ledoux , bergeron & petitjean 2002 ) have shown evidence of dust grains in them . also , thermal emission ( at @xmath3 mm ) from dust in high redshift ( @xmath4 ) qsos in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have been reported ( bertoldi 2003 ) .",
    "the implied dust mass of @xmath5 m@xmath6 within a gyr after the big bang appears difficult to explain with traditional models of grain formation in evolved low mass stars ( dunne 2003 ) , from which grains are thought to be transported to the interstellar medium ( ism ) through stellar winds ( whittet 1992 ) .",
    "recent models have , therefore , focused on other sites of dust grain formation , such as ejecta of core - collapse supernova explosions that can occur on shorter time scales than that of the evolution of low mass stars ( dwek & scalo 1980 ) .",
    "core - collapse supernovae are thought to be capable of synthesizing a significant amount of dust in the sn ejecta .",
    "applying a theory of nucleation and grain growth developed by kozasa & hasegawa ( 1987 ) , kozasa ( 1989 ; 1991 ) and todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) have studied grain formation in expanding sn ejecta , the latter estimating the dust mass formed @xmath7 m@xmath8 .",
    "nozawa ( 2003 ) have extended it to the case of zero - metallicity sne for population iii stars ( see also schneider , ferrara & salvaterra 2004 ) .",
    "although the sn `` dust factory model '' would explain the large observed dust masses in high - redshift galaxies , observations of dust in nearby sne appear inconsistent with this model , falling factors of 10100 short of the required amounts ( @xmath9 ; see above ) . as an example , in a review of type  ii sn  2003gd ( ngc  628 ) , sugerman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) state that  radiative transfer models show that up to 0.02 solar masses of dust has formed within the ejecta \" .",
    "however , a recent study ( meikle et al .  2007 ) of the same remnant concludes that the mid - ir flux  is consistent with emission from @xmath10 of newly condensed dust in the ejecta \" . in a young , oxygen - rich snr in the smc , stanimirovic et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found only @xmath11 of hot dust ( @xmath12  k ) .",
    "the claimed sub - mm detection ( dunne et al .",
    "2003 ) of @xmath13 of cold dust toward the cas  a remnant was later shown to arise from interstellar dust in an adjacent molecular cloud ( krause et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "observational tests of predictions made by models of sne are difficult , involving far - ir and sub - mm observations of young snrs .",
    "one must disentangle far - ir backgrounds , separate newly synthesized dust from circumstellar and interstellar dust , and understand the role of snr reverse shocks , which can destroy newly synthesized dust in high - speed ejecta . a case in point",
    "is sn 1987a .",
    "dust formation was inferred in ejecta of sn  1987a , but only @xmath11 was detected ( dwek 2006 ; dwek & arendt 2007 ) .",
    "additional dust is almost certainly present , because of observed changes in the optical and bolometric fluxes and emission - line asymmetries in the red and blue wings ( mccray 1993 , 2007 ) .",
    "moreover , the reverse shock has not yet reached the interior of the supernova debris in sn  1987a .",
    "these inner ejecta are most prone to dust formation , since they are cold , dense , and metal - enriched .",
    "a challenging theoretical issue is whether high - velocity dust ( @xmath14 km  s@xmath15 ) can survive the shocks , thermal sputtering , and grain - grain collisions , as the ejecta are slowed down by the surrounding ism .",
    "a goal of this paper is to determine how much dust survives the sn event and is incorporated into the surrounding ism .",
    "the relative speed of reverse shocks with respect to the expanding ejecta can be very large , and can raise the temperature of the ejecta to the extent of destroying the nascent dust grains in it .",
    "it is therefore important to study the effect of reverse shocks in detail .",
    "recently , nozawa ( 2007 ) have considered this problem and came to the conclusion , with the help of hydrodynamical simulation , that reverse shocks can destroy a fraction of dust mass of order @xmath16% depending on the ambient gas density and explosion energy .",
    "bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) also used numerical simulations and semi - analytical methods to conclude that only a small amount of dust mass survives ; e.g. , @xmath17% dust mass survives in the case of a sn with a progenitor of mass @xmath18 m@xmath8 and ambient particle density of @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "nozawa ( 2007 ) have included the motion of dust relative to gas within the sn remnant and calculated the evolution of dust grains over a period spanning the radiative phase ( @xmath21 yr ) , whereas bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) neglected the effect of motion of grains on dust destruction and calculated dust evolution up to the non - radiative phase ( @xmath22 yr ) .",
    "we study in this paper a simple and analytically tractable problem , namely the effect of reverse shocks for a power - law mass distribution of the ejecta , in the regime of self - similar evolution of both forward and reverse shocks .",
    "although the simple formalism does not allow us to study several important processes including motion of dust grains and its effect on evolution of dust grains our approach allows one to segregate the processes of destruction within the reverse shock itself from those occuring between forward and reverse shocks ( which can be dealt with in numerical simulations involving grain motion ) .",
    "we first summarize the results of the theoretical predictions of dust grain formation in snrs .",
    "todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) calculated the formation of different types of dust grains amorphous carbon ( ac ) , silicates ( enstatites : @xmath23 , forsterites : @xmath24 ) and iron - bearing magnetites ( @xmath25 ) and others , in ejecta with different metallicities .",
    "they found that ac grains are generally of larger size , in the range of @xmath26  m , whereas silicates are produced with sizes @xmath27  m. nozawa ( 2003 ) reached similar conclusions for pop iii sn events , with sizes of newly synthesized grains spanning a range of three orders of magnitude , with maximum grain size being less than @xmath28 m .",
    "the dust grain parameters in the ism are inferred to be somewhat different from these estimates .",
    "the extinction observations are satisfactorily reproduced by assuming mostly of two components graphite and silicate with a common power - law size distribution , @xmath29 , truncated at a minimum size @xmath30 m and a maximum size @xmath31 m ( draine 2003 , and references therein )",
    ". there also appears to be a population of very small grains with pah composition .",
    "nozawa ( 2003 ) found for grains synthesized in pop iii sn ejecta a size distribution with index @xmath32 for smaller grains and with @xmath33 for larger grains ( with the grain size at crossover point depending on supernovae models ) .",
    "we use these two power laws to bracket the possible size distributions of grains synthesized in sn ejecta , and assume that grains are formed in the range @xmath34 cm ( see figure 11 of nozawa ( 2003 )",
    ". we also consider the case of an upper limit of @xmath35 cm and compare our results for both upper limits .",
    "it is instructive to estimate the destruction time scales before we calculate the effect of reverse shock in detail .",
    "the sputtering time scale for dust ( graphite , silicate and iron ) grains of size @xmath36 is approximately @xmath37 yr , for ambient temperatures larger than @xmath38 k ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) , where @xmath39 is electron density . for grains with size @xmath7 @xmath40 ( which incidentally contain most of the dust mass for a @xmath41 distribution ) , and for @xmath42 @xmath43 , the sputtering time scale is @xmath44 yr .",
    "we now briefly discuss the self - similar evolution of forward and reverse shocks in sn ( see truelove & mckee 1999 , hereafter referred to as tm99 , for further details ) .",
    "the parameters used to describe a supernova remnant which affect its evolution are the energy of the explosion ( @xmath45 ) , the mass contained in the expanding ejecta ( @xmath46 ) , the maximum velocity of the material within the ejecta ( @xmath47 ) , and the density of the ism ( @xmath48 ) . denoting the time of the explosion as @xmath49 , we construct our initial conditions at a later time , still early in the history of the remnant , assuming the ejecta to have already expanded to a radius @xmath50 without any deceleration due to the ambient medium .",
    "if we consider sn to be a point explosion , then the radial velocity profile will be linear as ejecta with velocity @xmath51 will travel out to a distance @xmath52 : @xmath53 this profile becomes flatter as time progresses and the faster - moving ejecta are flung out to greater distances .",
    "the corresponding radial density distribution of the ejecta matter is given by : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the time - independent structure function of the density profile and the @xmath56 term arises from the free expansion of the ejecta .",
    "we define a dimensionless parameter to label shells of the ejecta starting from the centre outwards as w = , 0 w 1 following tm99",
    "we consider the situation when _ f _ is given by a power law in _",
    "w _ : f(w ) = \\ {    ll f_0 , & + f_nw^-n , &    . where we have separated the ejecta into a uniform density core region and a power - law envelope region .",
    "the continuity of _ f _ at @xmath57 and the normalization of @xmath58 translate to expressions for parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 in terms of the free parameters @xmath57 and _ n _ : f_0 & = & f_nw_c^-n + f_n & = & .      as the freely expanding ejecta come into contact with the ambient medium , with the contact discontinuity moving at @xmath47 , a speed much larger than the sound speed in the ambient medium , a forward shock",
    "is set up in the surrounding gas which propagates into the medium .",
    "the ejecta at the contact surface decelerates suddenly as it hits the ambient gas , and consequently , a reverse shock is set up that propagates inwards through the ejecta .",
    "while the mass of this matter swept by the forward shock is less than the total mass of the ejecta driving the shock , the remnant is said to be in the _ ejecta dominated _ or ed stage .",
    "it is in this stage , before the reverse shock has attained a significant velocity , that the ejecta can be approximated as a spherical piston freely expanding into the ambient gas .",
    "when the mass swept by the forward shock becomes approximately equal to the ejecta mass , the corresponding late - time limit is known as the _ sedov - taylor _ or st stage of the evolution of the remnant .",
    "we follow tm99 to follow the evolution of the reverse shock analytically .",
    "let @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote the radii of the forward and reverse shocks , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 be the velocities of the forward and reverse shock waves respectively , all in the rest frame of the unshocked ambient medium .",
    "we have the velocity of the unshocked ejecta as seen by the reverse shock as it propagates into the ejecta : _",

    "although the post - shock temperature at @xmath153 is higher than at @xmath157 , the shells in the inner region encounter the reverse shock later than shells in the outer region of ejecta , and by the time they encounter it , the density in the inner shells would have decreased rapidly ( see equation [ eq : den_ev ] ) .",
    "the rarefaction in the inner shells at the time of encounter with the reverse shocks lessens the effect of dust sputtering in these shells .",

    "results for graphites and silicate grains are shown in the upper and lower panels respectively .",

    "the sizes of grains which are sputtered below @xmath163 m lie in the range of @xmath164 m @xmath165 m , with silicates more strongly sputtered than graphites . in all cases , the curves of the maximum size of sputtered grains increases with decreasing values of @xmath89 and @xmath162 , finally plunging to very low values for @xmath166 , indicating negligible effect of the reverse shock deep inside the ejecta .",
    "for example , the ( dotted ) curve for @xmath155 shows a peak at @xmath167 below which the maximum size of sputtered grains decreases .    also ,",
    "although it is not explicitly shown in figure 4 , the corresponding results for @xmath168 show that reverse shocks do not penetrate most of the ejecta mass in the time period of the validity range of analytical solutions @xmath112 .",
    "analytical means allow us to probe deep into the ejecta mass distribution only for @xmath91 , and full hydrodynamical models are needed to address the cases of steeper profiles . for steep density distributions ,",
    "the limiting time of @xmath169 is reached by the time the reverse shock only skims the surface of the ejecta , as far as mass fraction is concerned .",
    "the characteristic time in the case considered here ( @xmath71 erg , @xmath72 g , ambient density @xmath145 g @xmath20 ) is @xmath170 yr . although , by the limiting time of @xmath171 yr for the validity of self - similar regime , reverse shocks can hit shells with small @xmath89 in these steep cases , the mass contained inside of these shells remains very large .",
    "in other words , in these cases we can not probe what happens to most of the ejecta mass , or the dust contained in them with analytical means , within the limits of the self - similar regime of shock evolution .",
    "we also note that a substantial amount of grain sputtering takes place in the hot gas between the forward and reverse shock that analytical methods can not capture .",
    "detailed hydrodynamical calculations are needed to address these issues , and our result can only provide a lower limit to the total mass fraction of dust that is destroyed .    finally , we calculate the total dust mass sputtered away as a function of initial grain sizes in the following manner .",
    "we first calculate for a given shell @xmath89 , the final grain size @xmath172 corresponding to the initial grain size @xmath173 .",
    "then the fraction @xmath174 is the total dust mass sputtered for grains formed in this shell .",
    "we then calculate the total dust mass sputtered for all shells ( for a given initial grain size @xmath173 ) , weighted by the shell mass in which they are situated , as given by , f_d",
    "( a_i)= d m(<w ) m_ej , where @xmath175 is the ejecta mass contained within the shell @xmath89 .    we plot these weighted fractions @xmath176 for graphite and silicate grains as functions of @xmath173 for @xmath177 in figure 5 .",
    "thick curves denote the results for silicates and thin ones are for graphite grains .",
    "as expected , the sputtered fraction decreases with increasing @xmath173 , and the fraction for silicates is in general larger than that for graphites .",
    "the total dust mass fraction that is destroyed can then be evaluated from these results by convolving @xmath176 with an initial grain size distribution .",
    "as mentioned earlier , nozawa ( 2003 ) found that the size distribution of synthesized grains is bounded by two power laws , with indices @xmath33 for larger grains and @xmath32 for smaller grains .",
    "we therefore estimate the total dust mass fraction destroyed , assuming a size distribution @xmath178 , with @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "the destroyed fraction of dust mass is given by , f = n(a ) a^3",
    "f_d(a ) da n(a ) a^3 da + , where the grain volume scales as @xmath181 .",
    "the results for graphites and silicates are presented in table 1 , for @xmath177 ( @xmath71 erg , @xmath144 g ) , leaving the cases of @xmath100 for which the reverse shocks do not reach the interiors of the ejecta within the validity range of self - similar solutions .",
    "we assume the lower and upper limit for the integral to be @xmath158 cm and @xmath182 cm respectively , as explained earlier in  2 .",
    "we also calculate the destroyed fractions for a truncated grain size distribution , with an upper limit of @xmath35 cm , and the results are shown inside brackets in table 1 for comparison .",
    "we have further studied the variation of the destroyed dust mass fraction with explosion energy and ejected mass .",
    "tables 2 and 3 show the fraction of dust mass supttered for two sets of parameters : table 2 for @xmath144 g and @xmath183 erg , and table 3 for @xmath184 g and @xmath71 erg .",
    "figure 6 plots the varition of ( logarithm ) of the destroyed dust mass fraction , @xmath185 , for silicates , for different values of explosion energy and ejected mass , and for different mass profiles ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "in the upper panel , we plot the variation of @xmath185 with @xmath46 ( in logarithm ) , keeping the explosion energy constant at @xmath71 erg , and in the lower palnel , we plot ( logarithms of ) @xmath185 with explosion energy @xmath104 , keeping the ejected mass fixed at @xmath186 g. the destroyed fraction generally increases with ejected mass , but its variation with explosion energy is not monotonic .",
    "the reason is that the process of dust destruction depends mainly on two factors : the speed of the reverse shock ( which depends on the characteristic speed @xmath187 ) and the characteristic time , @xmath188 .",
    "now , @xmath189 , whereas @xmath190 .",
    "it would appear that a change in ejected mass manifests itself in increasing @xmath188 , and thereby increasing the destroyed fraction , whereas , a change in @xmath104 affects @xmath188 and @xmath187 in a complicated manner , which results in the variation shown in the bottom panel of figure 6 .",
    "we therefore find that a mass fraction @xmath191 % of silicates and graphite grains created in cooling ejecta can be sputtered away by the reverse shock if the density distribution of the ejecta has a shalow profile ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "nozawa et al ( 2007 ) recently studied sputtering of dust in reverse shock and found a destroyed dust mass fraction of @xmath193 ; their result for an ambient hydrogen number density of @xmath194 @xmath20 and a progenitor mass of @xmath195 m@xmath8 is @xmath196 ( their table 1 ) .",
    "in fact , their result for the ` unmixed grains ' model ( which has to do with spatial mixing of the core heavy - element distribution ) in which the maximum size is @xmath197 m is @xmath198 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that a considerable amount of sputtering in their calculation is caused by the hot plasma between the forward and the reverse shocks ( see  3.3 in nozawa et al ( 2007 ) ) , which we have not considered . in our case , for analytical simplicity , we have assumed the post - reverse shocked gas to be cooling adiabatically .",
    "our results are , therefore , expected to give lower bounds on the actual dust mass fraction destroyed in sn remnants .",
    "there is another reason why the destroyed fraction of dust mass calculated here is lower than that of nozawa et al ( 2007 ) and bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) . strictly speaking",
    ", the destruction rate of tielens et al ( 1994 ) used here is valid for a gas with solar abundance .",
    "the gas in the dust formation region in the supernova ejecta is expected to be metal rich , and the destruction of dust grains in this gas can be more efficient in this case , since sputtering yields by metal ions are much higher in general than by hydrogen and helium ions .",
    "it should be noted that our results for the destroyed fraction is independent of the ambient density , since the gas density enters into our calculation only to change @xmath188 ( notice in equations [ eq : char ] that @xmath187 is independent of ambient density , and so the relative speed of reverse shock , and in turn the post - shock temperature , are also independent of ambient density ) . in reality , however , a lot of grain sputtering would take place between the forward and reverse shock , where the gas density will crucially depend on the ambient density .",
    "this aspect of grain sputtering is neglected in our analytical calculation , but is captured in the simulation results of bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) and nozawa ( 2007 ) .",
    "another difference between our results and those of bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) arises from the assumption of initial grain size distribution .",
    "bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) used grains of small size in their calculation , with silicate grains smaller than @xmath199 m and graphites smaller than @xmath200 m .",
    "also , their size distribution is more confined to a narrow range than the power law distribution assumed here .",
    "both these factors would enhance the destroyed fraction of dust mass in reverse shocks .",
    "for example , if the sizes of @xmath201 grains have a delta - function distribution around @xmath202 ( see figure 1 of bianchi & schneider 2007 ) , then the curves in figure 2 of the present paper ( say , for @xmath153 ) yield a mass destruction fraction of @xmath203 % ( with @xmath204 ) . for @xmath205 grains of size @xmath206",
    ", we similarly estimate a destroyed mass fraction of @xmath207 % . from figure 2",
    ", we estimate that one requires @xmath208 in order to get @xmath209% destruction of silicate grains .",
    "a note on the observed density distribution of supernovae ejecta is in order here .",
    "chevalier & fransson ( 1994 ) studied a model of the ejecta from a type ii supernova with a shallow ( @xmath115 ) core surrounded by a steep ( @xmath110 ) envelope . in the case of type ia supernovae , a steep density distribution in the ejecta mass has also been discussed in the literature ( colgate & mckee ( 1969 ) ; dwarakadas & chevalier ( 1997 ) ) .",
    "there has been success , however , in modelling data of type ia supernova with uniformly distributed ( @xmath210 ) ejecta ( hamilton & sarazin ( 1984 ) ; hamilton , sarazin & szymkowiak ( 1986 ) ) .",
    "it is worth considering what observations might improve our understanding of the net dust production by sne .",
    "far - infrared and sub - millimeter observations of reverse - shocked dust in young sne by _ spitzer _",
    ", _ herschel _ , and other facilities will help , but our theoretical studies suggest that unshocked ( cold ) dust may harbor a considerable mass of undetected dust . to constrain this dust and distinguish it from surrounding interstellar clouds will probably require sub - mm observations with small beam sizes .",
    "this brings in complications of the circumstellar environment of young sne .",
    "furthermore , the long times ( thousands of years ) required for reverse shocks to reach the core ejecta suggest that late - time observations of supernova remnants would be useful .",
    "we have studied the effect of reverse shocks analytically , in the regime of self - similar evolution , on the sputtering of dust grains that are believed to form in cooling ejecta . for representative cases we found that fractions of dust mass that is destroyed are of order of order @xmath211 % of silicates and graphites , for sn of explosion energy @xmath212 erg , ejecta mass @xmath213 g , and an ambient density @xmath214 g @xmath20 .",
    "our analytical formalism provides only a lower bound on the dust mass fraction that is destroyed by the reverse shock , since it ignores further sputtering of grains in hot plasma between the forward and reverse shocks .",
    "our results are , therefore , consistent with the recent estimates from numerical simulations which include these additional effects .",
    "furthermore , our study provides a formalism to generalize these results to cases with different values of sn parameters .",
