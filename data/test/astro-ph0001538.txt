    "nowadays , very high redshift galaxies and quasars are being found .",
    "however , quasars still offer the opportunity of a ( relatively ) easy construction of high - z samples , due to their high luminosity , quasi - stellar shape ( allowing accurate photometry ) , and to their emission lines ( allowing spectroscopical identification ) . therefore , many large optical quasar surveys are in progress or in project .",
    "even if high energy emission is quite a common quasar property , x - ray samples still need the detection of emission lines in the optical domain for the purposes of redshift determination . to improve the efficiency of all quasar studies",
    ", one has to increase both the size and the upper redshift limit of the sample , and to achieve a maximum completeness over a redshift range as large as possible .",
    "these surveys are essentially based on the photometric preselection of quasar candidates , in order to optimize the efficiency of telescope time .",
    "preselection makes the completeness questionable both at low and at high redshift ( see discussion in e.g. miller & mitchell , 1998 ) .",
    "even multiple color - color diagrams @xcite still reveal a bias in the range @xmath1 , exactly where a reversing of evolution is thought to occur , making completeness specially important . at low redshift",
    ", it has been shown that the usual morphologic prerequisite for _ quasi - stellar _ candidates results in a noticeable deficiency @xcite .",
    "this trend may increase the apparent evolution of quasars .",
    "the present paper describes a joint method both for distinguishing between quasars and stars / galaxies by their photometry _ and _ for obtaining an estimate of the photometric redshift of the quasar candidates as well . in  [ state ]",
    "we present the current state of the art in the optical search for quasars . ",
    "[ method ] gives a brief description of our method , which has been first validated with simulations , as shown in ",
    "[ simul ] , before being applied to real samples (  [ eis ] ) .",
    "the last section of this paper (  [ discuss ] ) contains a summary of our conclusions and a brief discussion .",
    "one of the most common problems in optical surveys is the selection criteria one has to apply in order to distinguish between stars and quasars , since both categories of objects have ( in most cases ) a point  like morphology .",
    "quasars are spatially resolved only at low redshifts and only when high quality imaging data are available .",
    "selection of qso candidates among stellar objects from photometric data is becoming a standard method .",
    "the uvx technique ( uv excess ) separates stars from quasars with a redshift @xmath2 .",
    "this technique is still currently being used , e.g. in the _ chile - uk quasar survey _ , and the _ aat 2df qso survey_.    to avoid both the redshift limitation @xmath3 and the bias towards blue objects , other equivalent techniques are also being applied ( for example brx ) , with quite a high efficiency in other redshift ranges .",
    "many multicolor surveys use an increased number of filters , especially towards the red , with special care paid to high - z quasars : examples are found in boyle et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , kennefick et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , osmer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the references therein , jarvis & mac alpine ( 1998 ) and the _ dposs _ ( digital poss ii ) . in all these cases",
    ", the efficiency never exceeds 35% ( @xmath4 3 candidates selected per one real quasar ) , depending on magnitude and redshift .",
    "for all the selection methods described above , the working space is the n @xmath0 2d - manifold of n color - color planes .",
    "the locus of quasars at different redshifts in each of these planes is compared to the locus expected for main sequence stars . for quasars ,",
    "the allowed multi - color space is defined through simulated template spectra , set to different redshifts .",
    "basically all the selection procedures use the positions of candidates in the multi - color space either to compare with the expected locus for quasars or to compute the distance to the main sequence ( newberg & yanny , 1997 ; sloan digital sky survey - fan , 1999 ; krisciunas et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "quasar candidates are among the objects at the largest distances with respect to this main sequence `` snake '' .",
    "however the selection of candidates with quasar spectra is basically a 1d problem : the fitting between the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and the equivalent one obtained from templates ( quasars / stars ) , all of them computed within the same photometric system .",
    "two quasar surveys make use of such a fit to select candidates and to estimate their photometric redshifts .",
    "the calar alto deep imaging survey ( _ cadis _ ) uses specialized filters and a multicolor classification algorithm to distinguish between stars , galaxies and quasars , and the identification of high - z quasars in particular is based on the photometric redshift method @xcite .",
    "the _ large zenith telescope _ , a 6-meter liquid - mirror telescope , will provide photometric redshifts for more than 1 million of galaxies , thanks to a series of 40 medium - band filters specially designed , and will be able to select quasar candidates quite efficiently . for the purposes of this paper , even a reduced set of broad band photometric data on a given object",
    "shall be considered as a very low resolution spectrum ( _ r_@xmath5 1 ! ) , which could be fitted by synthetic templates according to the standard methods commonly used on photometric redshift estimates .",
    "assumptions on the morphology of the objects could be avoided in principle , in such a way that both point - like and spatially resolved sources could be examined through the same pipeline .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to have a prior idea on the redshift range of each candidate , in order to perform the spectroscopic follow up in the suitable wavelength range ( visible or ir ) .",
    "the software described in the present paper has been developed for the needs of preparing the quasars / agn sample to be assembled in the future virmos survey .",
    "it can however be applied to all multicolor catalogues .",
    "the forthcoming virmos spectroscopic galaxy survey will consist in 2 surveys : a deep one and a shallow one . the virmos - shallow spectroscopic sample ( statistically 1/4 to 1/3 complete to @xmath6 , no other preselection )",
    "will ensure random completeness , without any color or morphology preselection . the virmos - deep survey ( complete for all objects with @xmath7 )",
    "will provide the opportunity of assembling a quasar sample avoiding the drawbacks of any preselection , therefore basically free of the usual biases ( colors , redshift etc ) .",
    "so far , very few such samples are available : three examples come from the cfrs ( i=22.5 , schade et al . ,",
    "1995 ) , the faint galaxy redshift survey ( b=24 , glazebrook et al . , 1995 ) and more recently cohen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to r=24 in the hdf , involving , however , very few quasars .",
    "we are examining various possibilities of assembling a third quasar sample in the limits of the virmos - shallow survey , trying to get as much as possible of the spectra of the several thousands of quasars present in this field by selecting photometric candidates . comparing the three virmos samples",
    "should provide a unique opportunity of examining the biases introduced by a photometric and/or morphological preselection on the quasar samples .",
    "our method used here is closely based on _ hyperz _ , a public photometric redshift code presently under development at the observatoire midi - pyrnes .",
    "details on _ hyperz _ will be given in a forthcoming paper ( bolzonella et al .",
    ", 2000 ; see also miralles & pell , 1998 ; pell et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "it is basically a standard sed fitting procedure : the observed photometric sed of a given object , obtained through @xmath8 filters , is compared to the sed computed for a set of template spectra .",
    "the aim is to find the best fit between the observed and the model photometry through a standard @xmath9 minimization procedure :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the observed and the template fluxes in the @xmath13 band , and @xmath14 is the error on the observed flux in this band .",
    "fluxes are normalized to an arbitrary reference filter .",
    "this is a quite general method .",
    "the photometric redshift is the redshift @xmath15 corresponding to the minimum @xmath9 value . as expected , the accuracy on the photometric redshift determination depends strongly on the set of filters used ( number and wavelength coverage ) ; this is illustrated in the next paragraph .    in order to apply this method to quasars ,",
    "the template set is made by series of simulated quasar spectra .",
    "these spectra have been constructed by varying the slope of the power - law spectra ( spectral index ) in the optical ( between 0.0 and 1.0 , in 3 steps ) while keeping the ultraviolet index , @xmath16 , constant at 1.76 ( a value compatible with wang et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "emission lines are included ( ly@xmath17 , ly@xmath18 , ciii , civ , mgii , siiv , h@xmath17 , h@xmath18 and h@xmath19 ) with gaussian profiles and typical intensities ( e.g. peterson , 1997 ) , as well as the small blue bump , centered at 3000  .",
    "the redshift value is set between 0 and 7 .",
    "totally , there are 213 quasar spectra , with 71 redshift steps ( d@xmath20 ) , with 3 simulated spectra on each step , obtained by varying the optical spectral index .",
    "the ly@xmath17 forest has been modelized according to madau ( 1995 ) , while no reddening has been included .",
    "we also included the stellar library of pickles ( 1998 ) , which contains 108 spectra of stellar types ranging from o to m , including dwarfs and giant stars .",
    "additionally , we included 22 white dwarf and carbon stars spectra , which are known to contaminate the quasar candidates catalogues .    when applying the method to a given sample",
    ", the discrimination between stars and quasars is performed in two steps . a first distinction between stars and quasars",
    "is made by identifying as star ( quasars ) the objects that show a better fit to one of the stellar ( quasar ) spectra .",
    "a further selection on the remaining sample can be made , based on the value of the reduced @xmath9 , with stars identified as objects excluded as quasars at the 95% or 99% confidence levels . in the present paper , the terms `` @xmath9 selection '' or `` no @xmath9 selection '' will apply for such a distinction . when an object is identified as quasar candidate , a photometric redshift estimation is automatically provided .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath21 , is equal to the number of filters minus 2 : we lose one degree by normalizing the flux to a reference filter and one degree because of the `` best fit '' procedure . in this way",
    ", the separation between stars and quasars is reduced to a one  dimensional fit between the data ( the observed sed ) and the spectral templates .    as expected , and as confirmed by the simulations , the quality of the quasar / star discrimination depends on the filter combination , as it happens for the photometric redshift estimate in the case of galaxies .",
    "not only the number of filters is important , but also the wavelength range covered .",
    "another important point is the width of the filters which must be suited to the width of quasar spectral features .",
    "a realistic determination of the photometric errors is the key to a successful issue for this method .",
    "the first test of this method has been done on mixed ( quasars + stars ) simulated catalogues . in this paragraph",
    "we intend to show the importance of the set of filters used for optimizing the results .",
    "first , let us define an arbitrary and useful quantity which is aimed to quantify the efficiency of this procedure .",
    "let @xmath22 be the number of quasar candidates resulting from the identification technique , @xmath23 the number of actual quasars found as candidates ( real quasars effectively selected ) , and @xmath24 the number of expected quasars . in principle , @xmath24 is a quantity which can be estimated from previous surveys .",
    "we define the `` _ efficiency _ '' of the method as follows : + _ efficiency_=_completeness _ @xmath0 _ confirmation rate _ , + where _ completeness_@xmath25/@xmath26 and _ confirmation rate _ @xmath25/@xmath27 . obviously , both the _ completeness _ and the _ confirmation rate _ take values in the interval [ 0,1 ] and so does the _",

    ", 1995 ( r95 ) .",
    "the star counts correspond to the six deep multicolor survey ( hereafter dms ) fields , since we primarily tested our results with the results of this survey .",
    "the fields with their surface ( in square arc minutes ) and the estimated star numbers are given in table [ gal_lat ] .",
    "quasar numbers were based on previous surveys ( hartwick & schade , 1990 , hereafter hs90 ) .",
    "catalogues contain @xmath28100 quasars and @xmath283000 stars , with a magnitude limit of @xmath29=22.2 and photometric errors scaling with magnitude , with typical values of the order of 0.1 magnitudes .",
    "quasars are uniformly distributed in redshift , in order to obtain reasonable statistical results at all redshifts .",
    ".the six dms fields , galactic coordinates , surfaces and estimated star numbers . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a closer look at fig .",
    "[ chi2sel ] and table [ filter_comb ] reveals that the filter combination is , most of the time , more important than the number of filters . in general , filters like u or the infrared filters h and/or k are very useful : they add much photometric information constraining the number of candidates .",
    "neighboring filters like b , v , r , when used all together , decrease the _ efficiency _ because , as mentioned above , they increase the number of the degrees of freedom without adding any essential information .",
    "a comparison of the two figures reveals several trends .",
    "the _ completeness _ is almost not influenced by a @xmath9 selection in the case of 3-filter combinations ( such as ubv , bri , bvr , bvi , or ubr ) .",
    "it is , however , strongly influenced by a @xmath9 selection when the filter u is present , in sets of 4 or more filters .",
    "note that this quantity decreases significantly , when a @xmath9 selection is imposed , for filter combinations with index higher than 26 , which are all sets containing the u - filter .",
    "furthermore , the _ confirmation rate _ is generally increasing with increasing number of filters . the decision whether to make a @xmath9 selection or",
    "not depends on the available time for spectroscopy and the scientific objectives of the project .    for this purpose",
    ", we made an approximative estimation of the time needed for making the spectroscopy in order to cover an area of 1 square degree , @xmath30 , for the same 40 filter combinations , given a detector area , @xmath31 , a magnitude limit , @xmath29 , a quasar candidate density , @xmath32 ( depending on this limit as well as on the filter combination ) , a number of slits , @xmath33 and an exposure time , @xmath34 , with and without any @xmath9 selection .",
    "we calculate @xmath30 as : @xmath35    fig .",
    "[ teltime ] illustrates @xmath30 ( in hours ) for @xmath36 , s=0.06 square degrees , g=10 and @xmath373 hours , without any preselection ( solid line ) and with a @xmath9 selection ( dashed line ) .",
    "note that the y - axis is logarithmic .",
    "as expected , there is an anticorrelation between @xmath30 and the _ confirmation rate _ , as it appears from the comparison of fig .",
    "[ chi2sel ] and [ teltime ] .",
    "the highest the _ confirmation rate _ , the less time is required .",
    "the problem of the quasar photometric redshift ( hereafter @xmath38 ) estimation is at least as complex as the one for galaxies .",
    "quasar spectral features ( mainly emission lines ) are rather narrow and the overall shape of the ultra - violet and optical continuum is a single power low , while the filters commonly used for photometry are wide - band filters , not very suitable for the quasar characteristics .",
    "all the above are in the origin of the dispersed values of the estimated quasar @xmath38 , when compared to the spectroscopic ones , especially for quasars with redshifts lower than @xmath39 .",
    "the filter combination is very important for the accurate determination of the @xmath38 .",
    "figure [ zphotsimps ] shows the photometric redshift versus the model redshift , for a catalogue of 1540 simulated quasars , uniformly distributed over the redshift range [ 0,6 ] , and for 4 different filter combinations . from top to bottom and left to right the following filter combinations are illustrated : bvri ( a ) , bvik ( b ) , ubvri ( c ) , ubvrik ( d ) .",
    "0.2 cm    the use of the filter set bvri is clearly a bad choice : these four filters cover a relatively short wavelength range and their effective wavelengths lie close to each other .",
    "the @xmath38 in this case is poorly determined for @xmath40 , while there is also a large dispersion at @xmath41 . if we replace the r - filter by the k - filter ( figure [ zphotsimps]b ) , the dispersion becomes more important at redshifts higher than 4 , since this is the redshift at which ly@xmath42 should enter the r - band , but it decreases the dispersion at redshifts lower than 3 , due to the very large wavelength range covered .",
    "adding the filter u to the bvri combination decreases the dispersion at both high and low redshifts ( figure [ zphotsimps]c ) , but one can still feel the absence of an infrared filter , whose importance is seen in figure [ zphotsimps]d .",
    "the periodic accumulations of points at different redshifts are due to the passage of ly@xmath42 from one filter to the other . as a general rule",
    ", the determination of the photometric redshifts should be rather accurate in the redshift range [ 3,5 ] even without the u or an infrared filter , but their presence is crucial for all other redshift ranges .",
    "the quality of the @xmath38 determination is likely to improve if real quasar spectra are used .",
    "however , this implies that a spectral library is required , containing some hundreds of quasar spectra , with redshifts spanning from 0 to @xmath43 and with a spectral coverage spanning form the ultra - violet to the infrared .      the _ completeness _ , the _ confirmation rate _ and , therefore , the _ efficiency _ of the method depend on the redshift .",
    "the demonstration of this dependence is easy to show for the _ completeness _ , but not for the _ confirmation rate_. the _ completeness _ within redshift bins has the same definition as for the entire sample : the ratio between the number of real quasars with spectroscopic redshifts ( hereafter @xmath44 ) within the examined bin , identified as candidates even if their @xmath38 is significantly different from their @xmath44 , over the estimated total number of quasars .",
    "figure [ cvsz ] illustrates the _ completeness _ versus the redshift , without @xmath9 selection , for 4 different filter sets : the solid , dotted , dashed and dashed - dotted lines correspond to bvik , ubvrih , uvk and bvri , respectively .",
    "the _ completeness _ over the whole redshift range for this 4 filter combinations is in all cases more than 85% , as shown in figure [ chi2sel]a .",
    "figure [ cvsz ] reveals that , independently of the filter combination , the _ completeness _ is always lower in the redshift range [ 2,3 ] due , as already mentioned , to the stellar  like colors of quasars .",
    "this fact could certainly increases the number of quasar candidates within this range but it could also be a possible source of incompleteness , since some quasars will inevitably be classified as stars . furthermore , different filter combinations offer a different _ completeness _ at different redshifts .",
    "the filter set bvik assures a _ completeness _ of over 70% in the critical redshift range [ 2,3 ] , which however remains low up to @xmath45 .",
    "uvk offers the possibility of a _ completeness _ of @xmath2880% for @xmath46 , while ubvrih results give a _ completeness _ over 90% for high-@xmath15 quasar samples",
    "( @xmath47 ) .",
    "things become more complicated if one tries to make an equivalent evaluation of the _ confirmation rate _ within redshift bins .",
    "this time , the _ confirmation rate _ is the ratio between the number of real quasars with @xmath38 in the examined redshift bin , over the number of quasar candidates ( quasars + possibly stars ) with @xmath38 that belong to this particular redshift interval .",
    "obviously , this definition depends on the accuracy of the determination of the @xmath38 as well as on the width of the redshift bins .",
    "therefore , the dependence of the confirmation rate versus the redshift can be evaluated qualitatively but not quantitatively , and so it goes for the _ efficiency _ as well .",
    "if the final aim of a survey is assembling a quasar sample with redshifts within a restrained interval , all candidates with a @xmath38 that lies outside this interval will , in principle , be rejected . in the more realistic case of an all redshift survey",
    ", the most interesting strategy is to simply optimize the spectroscopy towards the optical or the infrared wavelengths .",
    "the spectroscopy of quasars with redshifts up to @xmath283 is much more interesting in the optical band , while higher redshift quasars should be spectroscopically observed in the infrared , since most of their emission lines are shifted to these wavelengths .",
    "the simulations have shown that , although the determination of quasar @xmath38 is sometimes dispersed at @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( figure [ zphotsimps ] ) , this effect hardly translates into high-@xmath15 quasars ( @xmath50 ) being wrongly identified as low-@xmath15 ones ( @xmath51 ) or vice versa .",
    "the method presented above has been tested on a series of samples found in the literature , giving rather satisfactory results .",
    "depending on the sample and the available information , the _ confirmation rate _ and/or the _ completeness _ have been calculated .",
    "the deep multicolor survey is an imaging survey covering 6 fields on a total area of 0.83 square degrees on the northern sky at high galactic latitude , carried out at the 4 m mayall telescope of the kitt peak national observatory .",
    "6 filters have been used , covering the wavelength range from 3000 to 10000  : u , b , v , r , i75 and i86 , and a photometric catalogue of @xmath28 21000 stellar  like objects has been assembled , with the aim of conducting a multicolor quasar search ( osmer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the references therein ) .",
    "137 stars , 49 compact narrow emission line galaxies ( hereafter cnelgs ) , and 54 quasars with redshifts spanning from 0.3 to 4.3 have already been spectroscopically identified .",
    "these objects were the 240 quasar candidates selected by hall et al . according to their position on color - color plots , a high fraction of them ( 194 objects ) selected by the uvx technique ( hall et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "this selection favored quasars with redshifts less than 2.2 .",
    "the redshift distribution of these objects can be seen in fig .",
    "[ histo ] , where the spectroscopic sample is plotted by a dotted line .    for our purposes",
    ", we cut the catalogue at b=22.3 , a limit at which the sample is almost 100% complete and only marginally contaminated ( @xmath28 8% ) by galaxies , and we only used objects for which photometry was available in all 6 filters .",

    "the result is different when the same extended template library is applied to the 34 b @xmath57 dms cnelgs . in this case , 85% of the sample ( 29 objects )",
    "is well fitted by galaxy spectra rather than quasar or stellar templates .",
    "the fraction of best - fit galaxy templates corresponding to young starbursts is @xmath64 . generally speaking",
    ", a typical fraction between @xmath65 and @xmath66 of the quasar candidates is also compatible with young starbursts , and cnelgs are hardly selected as quasars , when supplementary galaxy templates are used .",
    "to summarize , adding star - bursting and early - type galaxy templates does not give a better solution to the problem of selecting quasar candidates : if star - burst candidates are included in the list , the number of candidates is multiplied by a factor of 4 to 5 . on the other side , objects like cnelgs will not be mixed with the quasar candidates but we take the risk to miss @xmath67 of the quasars , identified as star - bursting galaxies .",
    "however , for the purposes of a survey , all objects will be tested through the same , general pipeline .",
    "some objects ( like quasars and compact blue galaxies ) will inevitably end up as candidates in more than one list , depending on the different selection criteria .",
    "figure [ zmzpps ] left presents the @xmath38 versus @xmath44 for the 51 dms quasars . for 23 of them , @xmath68 .",
    "we note an important dispersion for redshifts lower than typically 2.5 : quasars with a @xmath69 $ ] are better fitted by templates of quasars with @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "this is also the tendency arising from simulations and shown on figure [ zphotsimps ] ( upper right ) , for the filter combination ubvri .",
    "figure [ zmzpps ] right presents the @xmath38 versus @xmath44 for a new sample of 46 spectroscopically identified quasars ( hall et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "17 of them have @xmath68 .",
    "this time we note that quasars with a @xmath71 $ ] are better fitted by quasars with @xmath72 $ ] , and this trend is also seen on the simulations ( figure [ zphotsimps ] upper right ) for the same set of filters .",
    "the _ completeness _ has also been tested on two recently published quasar catalogues .",
    "liu et al . ( 1999 ) published a list of 30 spectroscopically confirmed quasars with their photometry in b , v and r. these objects have @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and were selected on a one square degree field centered on the hdf north .",
    "they were firstly identified as quasar candidates by their ( b - v ) ( v - r ) colors , along with 31 other candidates that , after the spectroscopy , turned out to be stars .    with our method",
    "we identified all 30 quasars as quasar candidates .",
    "however , the limited number of filters did not allow us to reduce the number of stars selected as quasar candidates , 30 out of 31 were in our own list .",
    "we also applied our method to the parkes subsample published by francis et al .",
    "only point - like objects , with the photometry in all 7 filters ( b , v , r , i , j , h , k@xmath76 ) were kept , thus 129 out of the 157 quasars of the initial sample remain in our catalogue . at a confidence level of 99% , 107 among these objects were classified as quasar candidates ( _ completeness_=0.83 ) . if no @xmath77 selection is applied , the _ completeness _ is equal to 0.97 .",
    "columns 7 to 14 in table [ efficiency ] summarize these results .",
    "simulation results are also given for comparison .",
    "note that in both cases , the _ completeness _ for the real samples is found to be even higher than expected according to the simulations .",
    "_ confirmation rate _ and _ efficiency _ can not be computed for these two samples , since the entire point - like object catalogues ( including stars ) are not available .",
    "an attempt to apply our method to the eis  wide ( patch b ) data was made .",
    "the results are approximatively the same as those obtained in multicolor procedures .",
    "this was somewhat expected : the multicolor approach proposed here , when applied to a 3 filter data set , is equivalent to a color  selection technique .",
    "note that 3 filters have been used to carry out this survey : b , v and i. on a ( b - v ) ( v - i ) diagram , quasar evolutionary tracks up to a redshift of @xmath78 and the main sequence stars mix together .",
    "the quasar multicolor selection technique presented in this paper has some advantages as compared to the `` traditional '' color - color methods .",
    "first , it has the advantage of selecting quasar candidates even at redshifts where quasar and stellar colors are very much alike ( 2.5  3.0 ) .",
    "however , the _ efficiency _ varies with the redshift .",
    "independently of the filter set , some quasars with redshifts lying in the interval [ 2.5,3 ] will be skipped .",
    "furthermore , the number of quasar candidates with estimated @xmath38 within this range will be far higher in comparison to other redshift bins .",
    "the set of filters used plays an important role in these results .",
    "adding a filter is not necessarily equivalent to adding information and does not always improve the results , but imposes more stringent constraints by increasing the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "for this reason , a @xmath9 selection does not improve the results in all cases .",
    "this technique gives also an estimate of the ( photometric ) redshift of the candidates , and it is thus able to improve the spectroscopic follow up of a given sample . in some cases , which depend ( again ) on the filter combination and the redshift of the objects , this determination can be accurate ( @xmath79 ) . in most cases , quasars at redshift @xmath40",
    "will not be misidentified at @xmath80 and vice versa , therefore the spectroscopy can be reliably targeted towards the optical or the infrared bands .    for the purposes of a survey aiming in assembling a quasar catalogue with a minimum cost , adding star - bursting and early - type galaxy templates does not appear as a priority . on the contrary",
    ", this addition will cause either the increase of the candidates by a factor of almost 5 ( if star - burst candidates are considered as possible quasars ) or the decrease of the _ completeness _ @xmath81 ( because an important fraction of real quasars will be better fitted by star - burst galaxies templates ) . for practical purposes ( e.g the virmos survey ) ,",
    "when all the sources examined through the same pipeline , a fraction of objects identified as quasars will be also found within the `` starburst '' sample , but this does not affect the present selection .    the same method can be extended towards different directions .",
    "first , it can be adapted to particular objects like very red quasars , by adding the suited templates .",
    "however , this has to be done thoroughly , to prevent from a possible and undesirable increase of the quasar candidates .",
    "it can also be used on spatially resolved objects , like seyfert galaxies , because by construction , the software is independent of the morphology of the objects .",
    "this can be done by adding a stellar component to the agn simulated spectra already used .",
    "last but not least , it can be extended to very high redshifts ( higher than 6 ) , after an appropriate modeling of the intergalactic absorption .",
    "as already mentioned , this software has been developed for the needs of preparing the quasars / agn sample assembled in the future virmos survey .",
    "however , the results and conclusions of this paper apply to all multicolor surveys in general .",
    "a cross - identification between optical and x - ray sources can be extremely useful , when x - ray data are available , and can increase the _ efficiency _ , as quasar candidates with a compact x - ray counterpart will have an even higher chance of being real quasars .",
