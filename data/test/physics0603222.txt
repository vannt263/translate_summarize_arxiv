    "in the last several years , many systems have been analyzed unraveling the way in which their constituents interact which each other . surprisingly , many seemingly diverse phenomena found in biological , social and technological systems @xcite share a complex interaction topology that is in most cases characterized by the existence of a few key nodes that participates in a large number of interactions @xcite .",
    "this observation is in sharp contrast to previous studies that in order to model the dynamical aspects of biological , social and technological processes assumed a regular or a random distribution of interactions for the system s units . obviously , the new approach to the topology of networked systems has important bearings on their dynamics and functioning as have been pointed out during the last few years @xcite .",
    "a first step is then the characterization of the topological properties in order to get better insights into the dynamics , functioning and new designs of natural and man - made networked systems .",
    "peer - to - peer ( p2p ) networks form a kind of open , decentralized overlay network on top of the internet @xcite , on which distributed users communicate directly to find and share resources , often music and movie files",
    ". these networks may be one of the few largest distributed computing systems ever , and more surprisingly , they can run with great stability and resilient performance in face of possibly the most ferocious dynamics .",
    "the number of hosts running on gnutella was reported to be 1,800,000 in august 2005 @xcite .",
    "recent studies have extensively investigated the traffic , shared files , queries and peer properties of some widely applied p2p systems such as gnutella and kazaa @xcite .",
    "it has also been reported that node connectivity ( the number of partners a node interacts with ) in gnutella follows a combination of a power - law distribution ( usually for nodes with more than 10 connections ) and a quasi - constant distribution ( for nodes with fewer connections ) @xcite .",
    "this may be due to the arbitrarily created connections : peers establish connections to others by searching presently available peers on the overlay , in addition to a few links to well known hosts provided by the system .",
    "peer connections in these systems only suggest routes of traffic and usually have no relation to peer properties , e.g. , peer interests or resources held by peers .    [ cols= \" <",

    "this paper presents the first study on social associations of distributed peers in peer - to - peer networks .",
    "several peer social networks have been constructed from the real user data collected from the gnutella system .",
    "basic properties of the social networks , including degree distributions , local topological quantities and degree - degree correlations have been particularly studied in this paper .",
    "the results have proved that peer social networks are small world networks , as peers are clustered and the path length between them is small . moreover , most of the peers ( nearly 98.5% ) are pure resource providers , contributing to the high resource reliability and availability of p2p networks in resource sharing .",
    "comparatively , free riding peers that do not contribute any resources are only a small fraction ( less than 1% ) of the whole network . for peers that have more than one connection , their undirected , directed ( including out and in ) and weighted degree distributions follow a clear power - law distribution .",
    "the exponents are greater than 2 for undirected and in degrees and nearly 1 for out degrees .",
    "investigations on betweenness and correlations suggest that dynamics of peer social networks are not dominated by a few highly connected peers .",
    "in fact , the peer degrees are generally disassortative mixing , except some @xmath0 and @xmath1 , suggesting that active providers are connected between each other and by active requesters .",
    "the collected social networks studied in this paper are only some small snapshots of the large - scale and continuously changing p2p networks .",
    "however , the kind of study performed here allows us to touch upon the real network topologies that are difficult to obtain with existing network models .",
    "the analysis results will give useful hints for the future design of effective p2p systems , by considering their acyclic topologies and small world architecture .",
    "in the future , the joint relation of the social network topology and the topology of the underlying peer - to - peer network ( e.g. , gnutella ) will be studied to examine their commonness and discrepancy . on top of the kind of network found in the study",
    ", simulations of processes can be enabled to investigate spreading processes @xcite , modeling of traffic flow @xcite and optimization of network resources @xcite .",
    "based on the current study on peer betweenness and degree correlations , we will further investigate network hierarchy , peer work load and dynamic properties of p2p social networks .",
    "the authors are grateful to di liu for his work on gnutella data collection , dr . kun yang and weibo chen for their help on early data calculation and the anonymous referees for their valuable comments .",
