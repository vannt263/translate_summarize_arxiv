    "the study of the effect of strong magnetic field on dense stellar plasma is one of the oldest branches of physics . it has gotten a new life after the discovery of a few magnetars- the strange stellar objects , with unusually high surface magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "these stellar objects are believed to be strongly magnetized young neutron stars .",
    "the surface magnetic fields are observed to be @xmath1 g .",
    "then it is quite possible that the field strength at the core region may go up to @xmath2 g .",
    "the exact source of this strong magnetic field is of course yet to be known .",
    "these objects are also supposed to be the possible sources of anomalous x - ray and soft gamma emissions ( axp and sgr ) .",
    "if the magnetic fields are really so strong , in particular at the core region , they must affect significantly most of the important physical properties of such stellar objects and the physical processes , e.g. , weak and electromagnetic interactions taking place at the core region . which means , the presence of strong quantizing magnetic field at the core region should modify , both qualitatively and quantitatively the equation of state of dense neutron star matter , and as a consequence the gross - properties of neutron stars @xcite , e.g. , mass - radius relation , moment of inertia , rotational frequency etc .",
    "should also change significantly . in the case of compact neutron stars , the phase transition from neutron matter to quark matter at the core region , if any , will also be affected by strong quantizing magnetic field .",
    "it has been shown that a first order phase transition initiated by the nucleation of quark matter droplets is absolutely forbidden if the magnetic field @xmath1 g at the core region @xcite .",
    "however a second order phase transition is allowed , provided the magnetic field strength @xmath3 g .",
    "this is of course too high to achieve at the core region .",
    "the elementary processes , in particular , the weak and the electromagnetic processes taking place at the core region of a neutron star are strongly affected by such ultra - strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "since the cooling of neutron stars are mainly controlled by neutrino / anti - neutrino emissions , the presence of strong quantizing magnetic field should affect the thermal history of strongly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "further , the electrical conductivity of neutron star matter which directly controls the evolution of neutron star magnetic field will also change significantly .    in another kind of work , the stability of such strongly magnetized rotating objects are studied .",
    "it has been observed from the detailed general relativistic calculation that there are possibility of some form of geometrical deformation of these objects from their usual spherical shapes @xcite . in the extreme case",
    "such objects may either become black strings or black disks . in the non - extreme case , however , it is also possible to detect gravity waves from these deformed rotating objects .",
    "in a recent study on microscopic model of dense neutron star matter , we have observed that if most of the electrons occupy the zeroth landau level , with spin anti - parallel to the direction of magnetic field and very few of them are with spin along the direction of magnetic field and landau quantum number @xmath4 , then either such strongly magnetized system can not exist or such a strong magnetic field is just impossible at the core region of a neutron star @xcite .",
    "motivated by the problems as mentioned in preceding two sections , in this paper we shall study the effect of strong quantizing magnetic field on the transport coefficients of dense stellar electron - proton plasma .",
    "we shall follow an exact formalism @xcite which is applicable for a wide range of magnetic field strengths and obtain the transport coefficients from the relativistic version of boltzmann kinetic equation by linearizing the distribution function and using relaxation time approximation .",
    "we shall obtain the relaxation time from the rates of standard electromagnetic processes taking place inside electron - proton plasma and make necessary modification in the rate calculation due to the presence of strong quantizing magnetic field .",
    "we have noticed that the electrical conductivity of the medium becomes extremely small in presence of ultra - strong magnetic field ( @xmath5 g ) .",
    "the magnetic field at the core region of a magnetar must therefore decay very rapidly ( time scale @xmath6 a few mins . ) and becomes moderate or low enough . as a consequence there will be in principle no problem on the existence of magnetars ( with very low or moderate core magnetic field ) .",
    "the formalism we have developed to obtain rates of electromagnetic processes or the relaxation time is also applicable to evaluate neutrino emissivity and mean free path in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field .    in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field , since the momentum component in the transverse plane with respect to the external magnetic field gets quantized , whereas the component along the field direction varies continuously ( from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ) , the momentum space volume element becomes @xmath9 ( we have assumed @xmath10 ) where we have chosen the gauge @xmath11 , so that the constant magnetic field @xmath12 is along z - direction .",
    "we have considered the simplest possible picture of neutron star matter with @xmath13 out of thermodynamic equilibrium and the neutrinos are assumed to be non - degenerate .",
    "the baryonic components are interacting via @xmath14 meson exchange type mean field and the electrons are assumed to be freely moving particles .    in this article",
    ", we shall first calculate the transport coefficients of electron gas .",
    "then it is very easy to obtain the transport coefficients for proton matter just by replacing mass , chemical potential etc . of electrons by protons and taking into account the proper modification in presence of @xmath14 meson exchange type mean field @xcite .",
    "spinor solutions for electrons in presence of strong quantizing magnetic fields are then given by @xmath15^{1/2 } } \\times\\left ( \\begin{array}{c}(\\varepsilon_{\\nu}^{(e)}+m_e ) i_{\\nu;p_y}(x)\\\\ 0\\\\p_z i_{\\nu;p_y}(x)\\\\-i(2\\nu e b_m)^{1/2}i_{\\nu-1;p_y}(x ) \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] and @xmath16^{1/2 } } \\times\\left ( \\begin{array}{c } 0\\\\(\\varepsilon_{\\nu}^{(e)}+m_e)i_{\\nu-1;p_y}(x)\\\\ i(2\\nu e b_m)^{1/2}i_{\\nu;p_y}(x)\\\\-p_z i_{\\nu-1;p_y}(x ) \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent up and down spin states respectively , @xmath19 h_{\\nu } \\left [ \\sqrt{e b_m}\\left ( x- \\frac{p_y}{e b_m } \\right ) \\right],\\ ] ] with @xmath20 the hermite polynomial of order @xmath21 and @xmath22 the energy eigen value with @xmath23 the landau quantum numbers .",
    "for neutron we consider the usual spinor solutions .",
    "since the temperature of the system is @xmath24 electron chemical potential , we have not considered the negative energy spinor solutions , in the energy eigen value @xmath25 is the transverse component of electron momentum . to overcome the serious problem on the mechanical stability and hence the existence of magnetars ,",
    "we have studied the variation of transport coefficients , in particular the electrical conductivity of electron gas / proton matter in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field and try to show whether the electrical conductivity which is solely responsible for the evolution of neutron star magnetic field , becomes sufficiently small in presence of ultra strong magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in section 2",
    ", we have developed the relativistic version of boltzmann kinetic equation for fermions in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field and obtain the expressions for transport coefficients following de groot @xcite .",
    "we shall use the relaxation time approximation for the collision term . in section",
    "@xmath26 we shall evaluate the the relaxation time from the rates of standard electromagnetic processes taking place at the core region .",
    "we shall incorporate the necessary changes in the rate calculation due to the presence of strong quantizing magnetic field ( or the effect of quantized landau levels ) . in the last section we shall discuss importance of the results .",
    "the relativistic version of boltzmann transport equation is given by @xcite @xmath27 where the second and the third terms are coming from electromagnetic and gravitational ( general relativistic ) interactions respectively and @xmath28 is the collision term . since we have considered the flat space - time geometry and noticed that there is no contribution of external magnetic field , only the induced electric field arising from local charge non - neutrality , causes an induced current in the system will contribute in the electromagnetic interaction term and the curvature term is neglected .    to obtain the shear and bulk viscosity coefficients , heat conductivity and electrical conductivity of dense electron gas we make the relaxation time approximation , given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 i.e.",
    ", the system is assumed to be very close to the local equilibrium configuration .",
    "here @xmath31 is the relaxation time and @xmath32 is the ( local ) equilibrium distribution ( fermi distribution ) function , given by .",
    "we shall now follow the general technique to obtain the perturbed part @xmath34 as a linear sum of driving forces . following the formalism developed in the book by",
    "de groot @xcite , we express the four derivative as the sum of a space like part and a time like part , given by @xmath35 with @xmath36 the hydrodynamic velocity , @xmath37 is the convective time derivative and @xmath38 is the gradient operator , with @xmath39 some kind of projection operator , @xmath40 the metric tensor . then using the eqns.(6)-(9 ) , the decomposition of @xmath41 and the equations of motion , given by @xmath42 we obtain the perturbative part @xmath34 , given by @xmath43 } p_\\nu e^\\nu ( 1- f^{(0)})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the driving force for bulk - viscosity",
    ", @xmath45 is the driving force for heat conduction , @xmath46 is the driving force for shear viscosity and @xmath47 is the driving force for electric current ( @xmath47 for @xmath48 are the components of electric field vector ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the equilibrium local kinetic pressure and number density respectively . for a non - relativistic boltzmann gas @xmath54 , the local temperature of the system and finally @xmath55 , the enthalpy per particle with @xmath56 the local energy density and @xmath57 the ratio of specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume respectively .",
    "now from the definition , the heat flow four current is given by @xmath58 where the first term is the equilibrium contribution , which is identically zero . then omitting the symbol @xmath59",
    ", we have the irreversible term @xmath60 again using the definition @xmath61 we have the heat conductivity coefficient @xmath62 now from the definition , the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath63 which can also be written as @xmath64 , with the equilibrium value @xmath65 and the non - equilibrium part @xmath66 which is a symmetric second rank tensor .",
    "now we consider a model in which a flow of electron gas with cylindrical symmetry is assumed . then considering @xmath67 , @xmath68",
    ", we have from the definition @xmath69 hence the shear viscosity coefficient is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 , the transverse component of electron momentum .",
    "then it is quite obvious that in presence of ultra strong magnetic field , for which @xmath72 , the shear viscosity coefficient vanishes . here",
    "@xmath73 is the maximum value of quantum number of the landau levels occupied by electrons for a given density and temperature . for @xmath74 , @xmath75,\\ ] ] where @xmath76 $ ] indicates the nearest integer less than the actual value .",
    "to obtain an expression for bulk viscosity coefficient , we next consider the pressure tensor , given by @xmath77 where the reversible part @xmath78 and the non - equilibrium part @xmath79 hence omitting @xmath80 , we have the traceless part of pressure tensor @xmath81 hence we have the bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath82    we shall now calculate the the electrical conductivity for electron gas .",
    "the electric four current is given by @xmath83 now because of local charge neutrality , the reversible part @xmath84 and the non - equilibrium part is given by @xmath85 then using the covariant form of ohm s law @xmath86 the electrical conductivity tensor is given by @xmath87 this equation shows that due the presence of strong quantizing magnetic field the electrical conductivity becomes a second rank tensor- even if the space is isotropic in nature .",
    "the @xmath88-component is given by @xmath89 the @xmath90-component is given by @xmath91 and finally the @xmath92-component is given by @xmath93 from eqn.(34 ) and ( 35 ) it is quite obvious that just like the shear viscosity coefficient , both @xmath94 and @xmath95 components of electrical conductivity vanish for @xmath72 , i.e , in the ultra strong magnetic field limit .",
    "this is of course not at all evident for @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "now to obtain the numerical values of all these transport coefficients , or their variations with the strength of magnetic field we have to know the relaxation time @xmath31 , given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the rate of @xmath101 electromagnetic process and the sum is over all possible electromagnetic processes taking place involving the electrons .    therefore to obtain the relaxation time we evaluate the rates of the basic electromagnetic processes , given by @xmath102 .",
    "now in the case of @xmath103-scattering it is necessary to consider both direct and exchange processes , whereas in the case of @xmath104 scattering only the direct term contributes .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath103-scattering process , then the direct part is given by @xmath105 similarly the exchange term is given by @xmath106 where @xmath49 is the exchanged momentum .",
    "the rate element is then given by @xmath107 since the spinors are functions of @xmath108-coordinate through @xmath109 ( see eqns.(2)-(4 ) ) , we use the relation @xmath110 and we also need the positive energy projection operator , given by @xmath111 substituting the positive energy spinor solutions ( eqns.(2)-(3 ) ) , we have @xmath112 the matrices @xmath113 and @xmath114 are given by @xmath115 @xmath116 where primes indicate the functions of @xmath117 .",
    "since the dirac @xmath118 matrices are traceless and both @xmath113 and @xmath114 matrices are diagonal in nature with identical blocks we have a few interesting relations , e.g. , @xmath119",
    "@xmath120 @xmath121 etc .",
    "the beautiful form of @xmath113 and @xmath114 matrices allow to multiply @xmath118-matrices in the above relations from any side or in any order .",
    "the other interesting aspects of @xmath113 and @xmath114 matrices are + i ) @xmath122 + ii ) @xmath123 + iii ) @xmath124 + iv ) @xmath125 + all these results are entirely new and to our knowledge not reported before in the literature .",
    "we do believe that these new results can have interesting applications in various studies of properties of strongly magnetized dense stellar matter .",
    "with all these new formulae , the transition matrix element for @xmath126 scattering direct term is given by @xmath127   dp_{2y } dp_{2z } dp_{3y } dp_{3z } dp_{4y } dp_{4z}\\nonumber \\\\ & & f_0(p_{2z } ) ( 1-f_0(p_{3z } ) ) ( 1-f_0(p_{4z}))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 .",

    "we have generated the hermite polynomials appearing in the matrices a and b numerically .",
    "we obtain the relaxation time from eqn.(36 ) and finally evaluate the kinetic coefficients from eqns.(18),(23),(28),(33)-(35 ) for various values of magnetic fields @xmath12 , temperature @xmath134 and matter density @xmath135 . in figs.(1)-(6 ) we have shown the variation of kinetic coefficients with magnetic field strength .",
    "identical results can also be obtained for dense proton matter .",
    "from the figs.(1)-(6 ) it is quite obvious that the kinetic coefficients are almost independent of magnetic field for moderate strengths @xmath136 , but all of them go to almost zero for magnetic field strength beyond @xmath137 .",
    "the first conclusion is therefore , that at ultra strong magnetic field , the matter ( electron or proton matter ) behaves like a superfluid insulator .",
    "the mechanism of superfluidity is of course completely different from conventional neutron matter .",
    "now as we know from classical plasma physics in presence of strong magnetic field , that the charged particles can only travel along the lines of force , motions are almost forbidden across the field , as a consequence @xmath138 or @xmath139 vanish for a classical plasma in presence of ultra - strong magnetic field , whereas @xmath140 remains non - zero even at very high magnetic field strength . on the other hand , in the case of quantum mechanical plasma as the magnetic field become strong enough , the maximum value of landau quantum number @xmath141 , which further means the system becomes effectively one dimensional in the ultra - strong magnetic field limit .",
    "then in the collision dominated scenario , since @xmath142 varies continuously from @xmath7 to @xmath8 and @xmath143 , @xmath144 . to elaborate this point a bit-",
    "since the current is flowing along the field lines only , then from the symmetric nature of @xmath142 , we have @xmath145 this is specially true for an effectively one dimensional collision dominated quantum plasma . in the case one dimensional flow ( free streaming ) of charged particles along the field lines , this is not true ; @xmath140 has non - zero finite value .",
    "since all the three component of electrical conductivity vanish in presence of ultra - relativistic magnetic field , this must affect significantly the ohmic decay of strong magnetic field .",
    "we know that the ohmic decay time scale is given by @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the dimension of the system . since @xmath148 for extremely strong magnetic field , as a consequence , the field should decay quickly .",
    "we have noticed that a field of strength @xmath2 g become @xmath1 g within a minute .",
    "this moderate field of course will take longer time to decay further ( long decay time scale ) .",
    "therefore the last conclusion is that stronger the magnetic field , shorter the decay time scale and as a result we do believe that the magnetic field strength at the core region of a magnetar can not be high enough and consequently there will be no problem on the mechanical stability or the existence of magnetars .",
