    "diffusion is a fundamental transport mechanism in nature and industry , with applications ranging from physics to biology , chemistry , engineering , and economics .",
    "this process has attracted much attention during the last decades , particularly in statistical and condensed matter physics : diffusion - reaction processes ; transport in porous media and biological tissues ; trapping in heterogeneous systems ; kinetic and aggregation phenomena like dla , to name a few fields . from an intuitive point of view , brownian motion is often considered as a continuous limit of lattice random walks .",
    "however , a more rigorous background is needed to answer subtle questions . in mathematical textbooks ,",
    "brownian motion is defined as an almost surely continuous process with independent normally distributed increments @xcite .",
    "the deceptive simplicity of this definition relies on the notion of `` almost surely '' that , in turn , requires a sophisticated formalism of wiener measures in the space of continuous functions , filtrations , sigma - algebra , etc .",
    "although this branch of mathematics is well developed , it is rather difficult for non - mathematicians , that is , the majority of scientists studying brownian motion in their every - day research .    in this paper , we discuss a different , but still rigorous , approach to define and operate with brownian motion as suggested by p. lvy @xcite .",
    "we construct from scratch a simple and intuitively appealing representation of this process that gives a closed formula mapping of the unit interval onto the functional space of brownian paths . in this framework , sampling a brownian path is nothing else than picking up uniformly a point from the unit interval . figuratively speaking , brownian motion",
    "is constructed here by adding randomly wavelet - based geometrical features at multiple length scales .",
    "the explicit formula elucidates many classical results about brownian motion ( e.g. , non - differentiability of its path ) .",
    "the illustrative character of the wavelet representation , along with the simple structure of the underlying probability space , is different from the usual presentation of most classical textbooks .    among various amazing properties , brownian motion",
    "is known to have a self - similar structure : when a fragment of its path is magnified , it `` looks '' like the whole path . in other words",
    ", any fragment obeys the same probability law as the whole path . as a consequence , brownian paths",
    "exhibit their features at ( infinitely ) broad range of length scales . as a matter of fact , multiscale geometrical structures are ubiquitous in nature and material sciences @xcite .",
    "for instance , respiratory and cardiovascular systems start from large conduits ( trachea and artery ) that are then split into thinner and thinner channels , up to the size of few hundred microns for the alveoli and several microns for the smallest capillaries @xcite .",
    "another example is a high - performance concrete which is made with grains of different sizes ( from centimeters to microns ) , smaller grains filling empty spaces between larger ones .",
    "the best adaptive description of such self - similar structures relies on intrinsicly multiscale functions to capture their mechanical or transport properties at different length scales .",
    "we illustrate this idea by constructing brownian motion using wavelets , a family of functions with compact support and well defined scaling @xcite .",
    "wavelets appear as the natural mathematical language to describe and analyze multiscale structures , from heterogeneous rocks to biological tissues @xcite .",
    "the wavelet construction of brownian motion naturally extends to fractional brownian motion and other gaussian processes and fields , allowing one to efficiently simulate , for instance , turbulent diffusion with high reynolds numbers or financial markets . in particular",
    ", we discuss the gaussian ( or massless ) free field and fractional gaussian fields which appear as basic models in different areas of physics , from astrophysics ( cosmic microwave background ) to critical phenomena , quantum physics , and turbulence @xcite . written in a spectral form in one dimension , brownian motion and the fractional gaussian field",
    "look very similar , one of them being the fractional derivative of the other .",
    "putting together these two processes reveals deep relations between them , and this correspondence carries over to higher dimensions .",
    "most importantly , the wavelet representation is a starting point for a number of highly efficient numerical methods to simulate various gaussian processes and fields .",
    "though wavelet representations and the related numerical methods are all known , they are not easily available in a single source .",
    "indeed the totality of these methods seems to be poorly understood , even amongst specialists .",
    "the purpose of this article is to present a unified and intuitive framework that is based on elementary mathematical structures like , for example , dyadic subdivision or wavelet tree .",
    "we also present some simple number - theoretic shortcuts and consequent numerical algorithms .",
    "finally , we discuss fast simulations of brownian motion in confining domains , where one of the difficulties is the ability to quickly access the local geometry near the boundary .",
    "these techniques can be applied for studying brownian motion and related processes or solving partial differential equations in complex multiscale media .",
    "we hope that this didactic article will provoke interesting discussions amongst the experts and will help for a better understanding of both theory and implementation of brownian motion and other gaussian processes and fields for a much broader community of their practical `` users '' , namely , physicists , biologists , chemists , engineers , and economists .",
    "in this section , we derive a wavelet representation of brownian motion in a simple explicit way , allowing one to gain an intuitive feeling of this constructive approach .      in order to illustrate the basic idea of a wavelet representation , we revisit the first single particle tracking experiment by r. brown who looked through a microscope at stochastic trajectories ( now known as brownian paths ) of pollens of clarkia ( primrose family ) @xcite .",
    "first examples of such trajectories for mastic grains in water were reported by j. perrin @xcite .",
    "the essence of the wavelet representation can be recognized in his description of three trajectories ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perrin ] ) that were recorded at 30-second intervals @xcite : `` _ ils ne donnent quune ide trs affaiblie du prodigieux enchevtrement de la trajectoire relle .",
    "si , en effet , on faisait des points de seconde en seconde , chacun de ces segments rectilignes se trouverait remplac par un contour polygonal de 30 cts relativement aussi compliqu que le dessin ici reproduit , et ainsi de suite .",
    "_ '' following this idea , let us record the positions of a particle ( e.g. , pollen or grain ) at successive time moments with a selected time resolution @xmath0 .",
    "each particle submerged in water is permanently `` bombarded '' by water molecules .",
    "since the number of the surrounding water molecules is very large and their tiny actions are mostly uncorrelated , net microscopic displacements of the particle can not be considered deterministicly as in classical mechanics , but random .",
    "since the interaction of water molecules between them is very rapid as compared to the macroscopic resolution scale , there is no memory effect in their action on the heavy particle . as a consequence , the microscopic displacements of the particle are ( almost ) independent and have a finite variance @xmath1 . the macroscopic displacement during the resolution time @xmath0 is the sum of a large number @xmath2 of these displacements with zero mean ( no coherent flow ) .",
    "although the average displacement is also zero , the stochastic fluctuations around this value are of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the central limit theorem gives us a precise probabilistic description of the fluctuations , resulting in a normal ( or gaussian ) distribution of macroscopic displacements of the particle @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that the gaussian character of the macroscopic displacements appears _ without any specific knowledge about the microscopic interactions_. the only important information at microscopic level was stationary , uncorrelated character of the interaction , and finite variance ( if one of these conditions is missing , the resulting macroscopic process may exhibit anomalous behavior , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is known as coarsening or upscaling : complex interactions and the specific features of the underlying microscopic dynamics are averaged out on macroscopic scales .",
    "this is the reason why brownian motion ( or diffusion in general ) is so ubiquitous in nature and science .",
    "once we know that the microscopic details are irrelevant ( under the conditions mentioned above ) , we can extend the gaussian behavior from macroscopic scales , where it has been established , to microscopic scales .",
    "this procedure can be called downscaling , when we explicitly and purposefully transpose the universal macroscopic behavior even onto smaller scales . the resulting _ model _ of the microscopic dynamics exhibits gaussian features at all scales .",
    "while the true dynamics and its gaussian model can be completely different at microscopic scales , they become identical at macroscopic scales .    knowing that a particle moves continuously , we connect its successive positions separated on time @xmath0 by a continuous line .",
    "since the experimental setup is limited to the selected time scale @xmath0 , nothing can be said about the trajectory of the particle in between two records .",
    "in other words , the only condition for the trajectory to pass through the recorded points leaves us a variety of choices for the shape of the connecting continuous line .",
    "the common choice is connecting the successive positions by linear segments .",
    "as one will see , this choice fixes a particular wavelet representation , the haar wavelets .",
    "we shall show that other wavelets , corresponding to other choices of continuous connections , are as well useful .    when the magnification and time resolution of the experimental setup are increased , smaller details of the particle s trajectory appear , allowing one to refine the above piecewise linear approximation . repeating this procedure , in theory up to infinity ,",
    "one recovers all geometrical features and thus constructs the whole brownian path . in what follows",
    ", we put this schematic description into a more rigorous mathematical frame .",
    "we start with the position `` records '' at every unit time : @xmath4 ( e.g. , every second ) along one coordinate ( two- and higher dimensional brownian motion is then obtained by taking @xmath5 independent copies of the one - dimensional process ) .",
    "we focus on the time interval between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the construction being applicable to any interval @xmath8 $ ] . for convenience , brownian motion is started at @xmath9 from the origin : @xmath10 . by definition ( or as a consequence of the central limit theorem if one relies on the above physical reasoning ) , the position at time @xmath11 , @xmath12 , is a random variable @xmath13 distributed according to the standard normal ( or gaussian ) law , @xmath14 , with mean zero and variance one @xmath15 in physics , the variance @xmath1 is related to the diffusion coefficient , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the one step duration ; here , @xmath18 yielding @xmath19 throughout the paper .",

    "the advantages of multiscale dyadic trees are numerous : the simplicity of construction , the generality of boundary shapes , the rapidity of distance estimation , the flexibility for shape modifications , and low memory usage .",
    "in fact , for a given precision @xmath78 , the storage of the dyadic tree requires at worst @xmath358 intervals ( i.e. , @xmath79 levels for each boundary point , for @xmath2 points ) . in practice , this number is much smaller since many boundary points share the same interval at larger scales ( e.g. , the interval of size @xmath7 is shared by all boundary points ) .",
    "the crucial point is that geometrical structure of the boundary does not matter at all : the method works for a random cantor dust as well as for a circle .",
    "moreover , the tree - like representation is highly adaptive , allowing one to modify the boundary from one set of simulations to other ( or even from one run to the other ) .",
    "this feature can be very useful to study diffusion - controlled growth processes like dla or transport phenomena in domains with moving boundaries .",
    "in this paper , we revised the multiscale construction of gaussian processes and fields .",
    "first , the haar wavelet representation of brownian motion was explicitly constructed as a natural way to refine the geometrical features of a brownian path under magnification .",
    "since the haar functions form a complete basis in the space @xmath145)$ ] and their weights are gaussian , such a representation can be extended to any complete basis @xmath147 of @xmath145)$ ] , wavelet - like or not . in other words , the construction of brownian motion has two separate `` ingredients '' : deterministic functions @xmath149 capturing geometrical details , and their random weights @xmath157 .",
    "the choice of the functions @xmath149 is voluntary that gives a certain freedom and flexibility in dealing with different problems .",
    "qualitatively , this choice determines the way of connecting successive positions of brownian motion at a given scale . on the opposite ,",
    "the random weights determine the intrinsic stochastic properties of brownian motion , independently of our choice of the basis @xmath147 .",
    "the multiscale construction gives not only a simple closed formula for brownian motion , but reveals its fundamental properties .",
    "for instance , continuity and non - differentiability of brownian paths naturally follow from this construction .",
    "in addition , we discussed a closed mapping from the sampling unit interval onto the space of brownian paths . sampling brownian paths can therefore be formally reduced to picking up a real number @xmath70 with the uniform measure .",
    "this construction does not require elaborate notions from modern probability theory such as wiener measures , sigma - algebras , filtrations , etc .",
    "although these notions are useful , the explicit multiscale construction is much easier for non - mathematicians .    these concepts are not limited to brownian motion .",
    "we illustrated how fractional brownian motion , gaussian free field , and fractional gaussian fields can be constructed in a very similar way .",
    "extensions to other gaussian processes were also mentioned .",
    "finally , we briefly discussed how the multiscale concepts can be used for simulating restricted diffusion ( i.e. , brownian motion in confining domains ) .",
    "the dyadic subdivision and the related hierarchical ( multiscale ) tree of subintervals allow one to rapidly estimate the distance to the boundary and thus to generate random displacements adapted to the local geometrical environment .",
    "such fast random walk algorithms have found numerous applications . as for usual",
    "brownian motion , dyadic decompositions appear as natural tools to store and rapidly access the geometrical information , resulting in fast algorithms .",
