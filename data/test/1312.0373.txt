    "pressure - balanced structures are commonly observed in space plasmas .",
    "they are often associated with the nonlinear saturation of the mirror instability ( mi ) @xcite which , being of subcritical type @xcite , permits the persistence of non - zero solutions below threshold @xcite .",
    "furthermore , near the mi threshold , the dynamics of weakly nonlinear mirror modes are governed by an asymptotic equation of gradient type [ 5 , 6 ] .",
    "this property implies an irreversible character of the mirror modes behavior , associated with ion landau damping , where the free energy can only decrease in time . in this framework , above the threshold , the mirror modes have a blow - up behavior with a possible saturation at an amplitude level comparable to that of the ambient field .",
    "below threshold , all stationary ( localized ) structures were predicted to be unstable .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study stationary localized structures resulting from the balance of magnetic and ( both parallel and perpendicular ) thermal pressures , whose simplest description is provided by anisotropic mhd .",
    "isotropic mhd equilibria are classically governed by the grad - shafranov ( gs ) equation [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] .",
    "we here revisit this approach in the case of anisotropic electron and ion fluids where the perpendicular and parallel pressures are given by equations of state appropriate for the static character of the solutions .",
    "however , the mhd stationary equations , at least in the two - dimensional geometry , turn out to be ill - posed . as a consequence ,",
    "these equations require some regularization . as done in a similar context of pattern formation [ 10 ] , an additional linear term involving a square laplacian",
    "for nonlinear mirror modes , regularization can originate from finite larmor radius ( flr ) corrections , which are not retained in the present analysis based on the drift kinetic equation ( see , e.g. [ 5 , 6 ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the anisotropic grad - shafranov equations are revisited when the gyrotropic pressures depend only on the local magnetic field amplitude that , as shown in the forthcoming sections , is specific for nonlinear mirror modes . in this case , as well known [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ] , the parallel component of the equation is satisfied identically . in section 3 , we show that in the two - dimensional geometry , the problem is expressed in a variational form with a free energy given by the space integral of the parallel tension . in section 4 , it is shown that the equations of state resulting from an adiabatic approximation of the drift kinetic description , require a regularization due to an overestimate of the contributions from the particles with a large magnetic moment .",
    "we discuss in particular the small - amplitude regime and show that the pressure - balanced structures are then governed by the kpii equation which possesses lump solutions .",
    "numerical simulations reproduce these special structures , that turn out to be unstable .",
    "computation of stable so- lutions lead to large - amplitude purely one - dimensional solutions that appear to be sensitive to the regulariza- tion process , an indication that the regime can not be captured by the drift kinetic approximation and that fi- nite larmor corrections and trapped particles are to be retained .",
