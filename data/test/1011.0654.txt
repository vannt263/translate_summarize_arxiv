    "the analysis of the electronic properties of semiconductors often requires considering the presence in their band structure of multiple degenerate valleys , centered around different , symmetry - related positions in reciprocal space @xcite . at low energy , the dynamics of electrons in each of these valleys can be modeled in terms of a long - wavelength effective hamiltonian , an approach suitable to describe the vast majority of the transport phenomena that are measured experimentally .",

    "the two best known examples of non - trivial topological insulators in two dimensions are provided by integer quantum hall systems @xcite and by spin - orbit induced topological insulators @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the non - trivial topological properties of the bulk band structure result in a quantized hall conductivity when the fermi level is located in a bulk energy gap ( for spin - orbit induced topological insulators , spin - hall conductivity is quantized only when the spin is a good quantum number and one can consider the hall conductivity for each spin state separately ) .",
    "indeed , it is well established that the expression of the bulk hall conductivity @xmath6 given by the kubo formula for linear response corresponds to the chern number that characterizes the topological structure of the mapping from the brillouin zone to the space of the bloch states @xcite .",

    "if the bulk band structure is fully gapped , and the chemical potential @xmath11 lies inside the gap , the hall conductivity ( in units of @xmath12 neglecting spin degeneracy ) , equal to the chern number associated to the occupied band , is given by @xcite @xmath13 with @xmath14 ( again , for spin - orbit induced topological insulators with conserved spin , these expressions hold separately for the two spin directions ) .",
    "the integral has to be performed over the entire brillouin zone .",
    "the system is topologically non - trivial if @xmath15 .",
    "the physical manifestation of the topological non - triviality , which discriminates between topological and trivial insulators , is the appearance of @xmath16 gapless states at the system edges , which can transport current even when the fermi level is located in the bulk energy gap .",
    "this statement , true for both integer quantum hall and spin - orbit induced topological insulators with conserved spin , relates the bulk electronic structure ( which determines the chern number ) to the edge properties and is known as _ bulk - edge correspondence _ @xcite .",
    "the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intro2 ] ) is often sharply peaked in the regions of the momentum space where @xmath17 , and hence the gap , becomes small  these are the valleys of the band structure .",
    "thanks to the fast convergence , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intro2 ] ) over the brillouin zone can be calculated using the long wavelength approximation for the hamiltonian valid in the individual valleys . in this case",
    "one can associate an index @xmath18 to each one of the valleys ( @xmath19 labels the valley ) , and the chern number is then the sum of the @xmath18 .",
    "this sum can vanish even if the individual @xmath18 do not , in which case the system is according to the definition given above topologically trivial .",
    "however , the question arises as to whether the non - vanishing of the @xmath18 associated to the individual valleys has observable consequences .",
    "indeed , a non - vanishing @xmath18 implies that valley @xmath19 gives an non - zero contribution to the hall conductivity , and the appearance of @xmath18 gapless edge states associated to each individual valley may be expected by a naive  extension \" of the bulk - edge correspondence .",
    "it may be argued that due to the overall triviality of the system ( i.e. , the fact that the chern number defined over the entire brillouin zone vanishes ) these states localize because they are not protected against disorder at the edge , which causes inter - valley scattering @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the fundamental question remains , whether in a system with ideal edges ( i.e. , edges that preserve the _ valley quantum number _ , well defined at low energies ) there exists a bulk - edge correspondence for individual valleys .",
    "here we consider the case of gapped bilayer graphene ( blg ) as a model system for the case in which two symmetry - related valleys are present ( the @xmath2 and @xmath3 valleys with non - vanishing @xmath20 depending on the valley , see fig . [",
    "fig : tcd ] ) , and investigate the low - energy electronic states at its edges .",
    "specifically , we consider different crystalline edges which do not couple the valleys , and we find the corresponding edge states in the different cases ( we have discussed elsewhere the effect of disordered edges , which is experimentally more relevant@xcite ) . if the bulk - edge correspondence could be generically extended to single - valley hamiltonians , one would expect that @xmath20 should imply the presence of exactly one gapless mode per valley per spin at an ideal edge of gapped blg , for all edges that do not couple the valleys .",
    "in contrast to this expectation , we show through an explicit analytical solution in complete agreement with full tight - binding calculations , that the number of the gapless edge modes depends on the boundary conditions , even when no mixing between valleys exists at the edge@xcite . in other words ,",
    "_ the valley - specific bulk - edge correspondence is not fulfilled for plain blg - vacuum interfaces . _    in order to understand this result , we examine the geometrical meaning of @xmath18 associated to a particular valley hamiltonian , and find that , contrary to the case of the chern numbers in topological insulators ( defined over the entire brillouin zone ) , @xmath18 in blg does not correspond in itself to a well - defined topological invariant of a mapping .",
    "nevertheless , the non - vanishing of @xmath18 still signals that the properties of the electron states in individual valleys are non - trivial , and we discuss how this non - triviality manifests itself at interfaces between different domains where the gap of blg changes sign @xcite . in this case , the number of zero - energy states corresponds to the difference of @xmath18 on opposite sides of the blg - blg interface ( @xmath21 , where we denote with @xmath22 the value of @xmath18 at the left and at the right of the blg - blg interface ) , in agreement with expectations based on bulk - edge correspondence .",
    "indeed , we show that for a blg - blg interface the difference @xmath21 is a well - defined topological invariant of a mapping , even though the individual @xmath23 and @xmath24 are not .",
    "these results reveal the _ marginal _ character of individual valleys in gapped blg : the _ difference _ of @xmath18 across an interface may or may not be topologically well defined , depending on the specific kind of interface .",
    "it is a well defined topological invariant across a domain wall where the gap changes sign , but it is not for a blg - vacuum interface .",
    "such a marginal topological character of a single valley is likely to be not only characteristic of blg , but is a more general property common to many other multi - valley systems .",
    "we start by briefly reviewing the known properties of the band structure of bilayer graphene , emphasizing the specific aspects that will be relevant later . in blg",
    "a gap between valence and conductance bands can be opened controllably by applying a perpendicular electric field , while maintaining the fermi energy in the middle of the gap@xcite ( the sign of the gap is determined by the orientation of the field ) .",
    "the continuum low - energy , long - wavelength limit hamiltonian for each individual valley can be obtained from the tight - binding description of blg with bernal stacking @xcite . with the four inequivalent atoms in a unit cell labeled by a(b)1(2 ) ( see fig . [",
    "fig : lattice](a ) ) , the dimensionless hamiltonian matrix for the wave function @xmath25 reads @xcite : @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the ( dimensionless ) wave vector , the valley index @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) defines the size of the bulk gap .",

    "the original four - component hamiltonian can be inconvenient to work with , especially when one needs to find solutions with specific boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , bearing in mind that the energy range of our interests would only involve the two low energy bands , we reduce to a two - component hamiltonian by rewriting the schrdinger equation @xmath37 in the following form : @xmath38 \\varphi = e(1+k^2 ) \\varphi , & \\label{eq : phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "as we are interested in the subgap edge state solutions with @xmath41 , only terms up to linear order in @xmath42 and @xmath43 are kept .",
    "if we further neglect @xmath44 and @xmath45 terms , we obtain @xmath46 which is the reduced hamiltonian , describing the low energy bands to the lowest order in @xmath43 and @xmath47 .",
    "this reduction procedure is essentially identical to that used by mccann and falko @xcite .",
    "here we emphasize two important aspects : first , the nontrivial topological properties of the original four - component model are fully inherited by the reduced two - component model  this will be shown in section [ ssec : bulk ] ; second , the relation between the low - energy ( @xmath48 ) and high energy ( @xmath49 ) components of the wavefunction [ eq . ]",
    "is essential to impose the correct boundary conditions at edges  this will be shown in section [ ssec : edge ] .",
    "starting from the effective hamiltonians given previously and following the logic explained in the introduction , we examine the nontrivial topological properties of a single valley of gapped blg by calculating the corresponding ( single - valley ) contribution to the hall conductivity @xmath50 .",
    "we consider the case when the fermi energy is lying in the middle of the bulk energy gap , so that we are dealing with one completely full and one completely empty bulk bands of .",
    "the valley - specific hall conductivity @xmath50 ( in units of @xmath12 ) corresponds , through kubo formula , to the quantity @xmath18 defined previously .",
    "here we present calculations for both the original four - band model and the reduced two - band model , and show that these calculations yield consistent results .",
    "this consistency implies that the nontrivial momentum topology of the original four - band model is fully inherited by the two - band model , which lends itself more easily to a geometrical interpretation of our results .",
    "the hall conductivity ( in units of @xmath12 ) associated to a fully - gapped model is generically given by@xcite @xmath51 where the non - singular propagator @xmath52 is defined as @xmath53 .",
    "for the four - component single - valley hamiltonian of blg , we find @xmath54 , which is equal and magnitude but opposite in sign ( @xmath55 for two valleys ; therefore , the chern number defined over the entire brillouin zone vanishes .",
    "this result is expected for blg , which is strictly speaking topologically trivial , despite the fact that the individual valleys possess nontrivial @xmath56 .    for the reduced two - component model given by eq . , we can write the hamiltonian as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 . in this case , using the simplified form of the above formula for two - band models@xcite , given by , we find @xmath59 , in agreement with the calculation based on the full four - band model .",
    "this agreement indicates that the nontrivial topological properties of the individual valleys are due solely to the low energy bands .",
    "it is worth noting that the integral ( divided by 2 ) in eq .",
    "can be also identified as the berry phase acquired by an electron adiabatically transferred along the path enclosing the area of the integral @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the quantized hall conductivity is equivalent to the quantized berry phase ( in units of @xmath60 ) associated with the single - valley hamiltonian @xcite .      we now proceed to calculate the exact solution of the edge states in gapped blg , for different edge structures that do not mix the valleys .",
    "we will only consider one of the two valleys , with @xmath61 , and the results for the other valley can be inferred through a symmetry transformation similar to time reversal .    .",
    "the upper panel case corresponds to the edge shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : lattice ] ( c ) , and contains two branches of gapless edge modes.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    the generic constraint for boundary conditions in the present model is imposed by vanishing probability current across the boundary .",
    "this constraint allows for a variety of boundary conditions which are physically valid ( see appendix [ app : bc ] ) . in order to base our investigation on concrete physical examples",
    ", we illustrate the boundary conditions that will be discussed in the following in the tight - binding picture of blg",
    "[ fig : lattice ] shows the edge structure for four cases , where the blg lattice terminates at different sublattices , either a or b , in each of the two layers .",
    "indeed , each of these combinations corresponds to a distinct boundary condition imposed in the continuum model , similar in spirit to what has been discussed by brey and fertig @xcite for single layer graphene .",
    "a significant difference is that in blg the boundary conditions in general involve both low ( @xmath48 ) and high ( @xmath49 ) energy components of the wavefunction .",
    "still , thanks to eq .",
    ", the latter can be written in terms of the low energy components and their derivatives , which is why a description in terms of the low energy components only is possible .",
    "for the structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice](a ) where the blg lattice terminates at the edge with sublattices a1 and a2 , this corresponds to imposing @xmath62 ( the blg is infinitely long in the @xmath63 direction and semi - infinite in the @xmath64 direction , i.e. the edge is located at @xmath65 ) .",
    "the general solution of for @xmath66 is @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) are coefficients that need to be determined .",
    "using , the boundary conditions lead to two coupled equations for @xmath69 with the secular equation for the existence of nontrivial subgap solutions @xmath71 this equation gives the dispersion relation @xmath72 for one sub - gap edge mode .",
    "when @xmath73 ( as is true for the @xmath74 mode ) eq .",
    "can be simplified ( since @xmath75 ) to : @xmath76 in fig .",
    "[ fig : solutions](a ) the analytical solution is compared with the full tight - binding solution , from which we see that the continuum model represents an excellent approximation .",
    "we conclude that for the edge just considered , one zero - mode exists ( per valley and spin ) @xcite , i.e. the result expected if the bulk - edge correspondence for single valley holds .",
    "we now consider the edge shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice](c ) .",
    "the corresponding boundary conditions are @xmath77 , which lead to the new dispersion relation for the subgap edge modes , given by @xmath78 this equation has two solutions related by transformation @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which comes from the symmetry of the wave equation under @xmath81 .",
    "it is this symmetry , which is also preserved by the boundary conditions in the present case ( whereas it is broken by the boundary conditions considered in the previous example ) , that guarantees the existence of _ two _ subgap edge modes .",
    "the dispersion relation given by can be further simplified when @xmath73 , to @xmath82 which explicitly shows a pair of gapless edge modes propagating in the same direction , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : solutions](b ) ( again , in excellent agreement with the tight - binding solution ) . without presenting the details of the solutions for the other cases , we only state that the edge shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : lattice](d ) ( @xmath84 ) yields no subgap modes .",
    "we therefore have to conclude that the number of zero - modes at the blg - vacuum interface depends on the specific edge considered , i.e. , the bulk - edge correspondence relating the hall conductivity and gapless edge modes does not hold in general for individual valleys @xcite .",
    "finding that bulk - edge correspondence does not hold for an individual valley , even though the contribution that each valley gives to the hall conductivity is integer ( in units of @xmath12 ) may seem surprising .",
    "specifically , one may wonder why the argument based on laughlin s gedanken experiment @xcite  which is normally invoked to justify the existence of edge states in integer quantum hall systems  does not apply to individual valleys in gapped blg .",
    "the answer to this question has to do with the fact that laughlin s gedanken experiment considers the adiabatic flow of electric charge , which is a conserved quantity ( in the context of laughlin s argument conservation of charge is so obvious that this assumption is not normally emphasized ) .",
    "contrary to the charge , the valley quantum number is not in general conserved .",
    "in particular , it is not conserved even in the presence of ideal edges if one considers the process  the adiabatic insertion of flux , which is the basis of laughlin s gedanken experiment .",
    "as we outline below , the non - conservation of the valley quantum number allows for the possibility of a quantized valley hall conductivity in the absence of zero - energy edge modes .    upon varying the magnetic flux @xmath85 in the usual cylindrical geometry involved in laughlin s argument , the allowed @xmath86 values of momentum along the edge flow according to @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the circumference of the cylinder .",
    "upon insertion of flux @xmath89 , the set of allowed @xmath86 values returns to the original one . from the generic form of the electron wave function",
    "it follows that the wave - function weight is redistributed in the direction perpendicular to the edge in the process of flux insertion .",
    "the redistribution occurs in the opposite directions for the states near two valleys , with states in one valley flowing towards the edge , and states in the other valley flowing away from the edge .",
    "this is the microscopic mechanism for the transverse valley current flow implied by the non - zero value of the valley hall conductivity , @xmath90 .",
    "the fact that the valley current flows perpendicular to the edge , according to continuity equation would imply accumulation of the valley density at the edge .",
    "this apparent valley charge accumulation can be accommodated in two ways .",
    "the first is by creating valley charge imbalance at the edge , in direct analogy to quantum hall and quantum spin hall effect with conserved spin .",
    "clearly , for that to occur , the gapless edge modes have to exist .",
    "alternatively , the valley current influx at the edge can be compensated by the adiabatic transfer of the electrons between the valleys induced by the flux insertion , which converts @xmath91 for states in the _ entire _",
    "1d brillouin zone of the cylinder .",
    "this is possible due to the fact that the valleys are indeed connected by the bands that extend deep below the chemical potential . as a consequence",
    ", the spectral flow can not be fully described in terms of the long - wavelength effective hamiltonian in the neighborhood of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 points , but it requires considering the hamiltonian of the system over the entire brillouin zone .",
    "this is how the non - conservation of the valley quantum number can account for the seemingly paradoxical result that non - zero @xmath92 can exist even when gapless edge modes are completely absent @xcite .     for gapped blg .",
    "panel ( a ) shows @xmath4 for a single valley as a vector field on the @xmath93 plane of @xmath0 .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the solid angle @xmath94 that @xmath95 covers when @xmath0 runs over the whole plane , the double arrow signifying the double covering of the ( upper ) hemisphere .",

    "it originates from the fact that the quantity @xmath18 associated with a given valley is not a well - defined topological invariant .",
    "this statement may appear to be in conflict with the case of domain wall interfaces , across which the sign of the mass ( @xmath43 ) in blg changes sign@xcite . in this latter case , bulk - edge correspondence  predicts \" that gapless states should be present , whose number corresponds to @xmath21 .",
    "when the gap @xmath43 changes sign across the domain wall , @xmath96 and indeed two gapless states are found at the interface .",
    "the conflict is only apparent , because @xmath21 does correspond to a well - defined topological invariant , even though @xmath18 does not .    to understand the difference between @xmath18 and @xmath21 we look at the integrand function that is used to calculate these quantities , which , from eq .",
    ", is given by @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "this expression corresponds to the jacobian of the transformation from the region @xmath93 of the momentum space in the vicinity of a given valley point , to the unit sphere @xmath98 on which @xmath99 resides . for blg , at large @xmath47 ( @xmath100 ) , the vector @xmath95 lies on the equator , and therefore the integral of @xmath1 does not represent a topological invariant since the mapping between non - compact @xmath93 and compact @xmath98 is topologically trivial . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : topo ] ( a ) and ( b ) , the vector @xmath95 wraps around half of the unit sphere twice , but does not cover the entire sphere .",
    "that is despite the fact that the integral rapidly converges for latexmath:[$k^2 \\gg    @xmath43 ; it is @xmath102 for the opposite valley or for opposite sign of @xmath43 ) . for massive dirac fermions such",
    "non - compact behavior has been discussed by volovik , and is known as _ marginal _ @xcite . in the same sense , the massive chiral fermions in blg are marginal as well .",
    "the marginality implies that a small perturbation in the hamiltonian ( e.g. momentum - dependent mass term @xmath103 ) or boundary conditions can have a big effect on presence or absence of the gapless modes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "now , for a domain wall such that @xmath104 and @xmath105 , despite the marginal character of @xmath18 on the two sides of the domain wall , their difference is a well - defined topological invariant .",
    "that is because at @xmath106 , the @xmath43 in the hamiltonians becomes irrelevant and the textures of the @xmath107 vectors for the two insulators seamlessly connect on the equator of @xmath98 , thereby compactifying the momentum space _ within the same valley_. the connection of the textures is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : topo ] ( c ) .",
    "similar considerations are not only valid for blg , but can also be extended to individual valleys in ( gapped ) single layer graphene @xcite , as well as to interfaces between gapped single layer graphene and kane - mele topological insulators with conserved spin @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the differences in the single - valley @xmath18 across the interface is a well defined topological invariant , corresponding to number of gapless states present ( or more precisely , the difference between the numbers of left and right moving gapless modes in a given valley ) .",
    "mathematically , this is a consequence of the index theorem discussed in this type of contexts by volovik ( see section 22.1.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "our work shows that the long wavelength hamiltonians that describe the low - energy electronic states in individual valleys of gapped blg possess non - trivial topological features .",
    "in contrast to integer quantum hall systems and quantum spin hall systems ( with conserved spin ) , these non - trivial valley - specific properties can not be described by a topological invariant .",
    "rather , they require the analysis of the specific interfaces ( in the present case the blg - vacuum interface and the domain wall ) in order to establish whether a topological invariant that determines the number of gapless edge modes can be defined .",
    "this is the characteristic signature of marginal topological insulators .",
    "it is certainly the case that the low - energy edge states that can be predicted through these topological considerations are not robust against short - range disorder that couples the valleys ( even though they are stable against long range disorder that scatters electrons within the same valley ) . in the presence of inter - valley scattering",
    ", the gapless modes associated to individual valleys will couple , leading to the opening of a transport gap .",
    "nevertheless , this does not mean that the low - energy states at interfaces and domain walls are experimentally irrelevant .",
    "in fact , for sufficiently pure materials when the fermi energy is in the gap , the states originating from the localization of the gapless modes can provide a dominant path for transport in the insulating state , because no other states are available deep in the bulk gap of the material @xcite .    finally , even though all calculations presented here have been performed specifically for gapped blg",
    ", our arguments do not rely on the particular form of the valley hamiltonian , or the number of valleys .",
