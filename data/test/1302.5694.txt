    "the recent discovery  @xcite of a new particle with properties consistent with a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson is clearly the most significant news from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "this discovery was supported by evidence for a higgs boson found by the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron @xcite and completes our picture of the sm .",
    "however , the sm leaves many fundamental questions open  perhaps the most pressing issue being that the sm does not explain the value of the electroweak scale ,   the higgs mass , itself . clearly , a prime goal after the discovery is to thoroughly test the sm nature of this higgs - like signal .    with the measurements in various channels , a comprehensive study of the properties of the higgs - like state becomes possible and has the potential for revealing whether or not the higgs sector is as simple as envisioned in the sm . in a recent study  @xcite , we analyzed the extent to which the results from the lhc and tevatron , as published by the end of 2012 , constrain the couplings of the higgs boson - like state at @xmath0 . to this end",
    "we assumed that only sm particles appear in the higgs decays , but tree - level higgs couplings to the up - quarks , down - quarks and vector bosons , relative to the sm are free parameters .",
    "moreover , we considered the case that new particles appearing in loops modify the effective higgs couplings to gluons and/or photons .",
    "we found that the sm expectation is more than @xmath7 away from fits in which : a ) there is some non - sm contribution to the @xmath8 coupling of the higgs ; or b ) the sign of the top quark coupling to the higgs is opposite that of the sm . in both these cases good",
    "fits with @xmath9-values @xmath10 can be achieved .",
    "since option b ) is difficult to realize in realistic models , it would seem that new physics contributions to the effective couplings of the higgs are preferred .    in this paper",
    "we carry our work a step further and investigate the extent to which current data constrain invisible decays (  @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the lightest susy particle ) or undetected decays ( such as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a light cp - odd , perhaps singlet scalar ) of the higgs - like particle . with a small @xmath15 of about @xmath16 . for the global fits , there is no difference between invisible and yet undetected decays , and we will use the term  invisible \" for both , genuine invisible and merely undetected . when talking about specific signatures , like monojets + missing energy , it is however important to make the distinction  in this case we will use `` invisible '' in the strict sense . ]",
    "our parametrization and fitting procedure is the same as in @xcite , where we introduced scaling factors @xmath17 relative to sm couplings .",
    "we treat the couplings to up - type and down - type fermions , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as independent parameters ( but we only consider the case @xmath20 , and we assume that the @xmath21 are family universal ) .",
    "moreover , we assume a custodial symmetry in employing a single @xmath22 .",
    "in addition to the tree - level couplings given above , the @xmath23 has couplings to @xmath24 and @xmath8 that are first induced at one loop and are completely computable in terms of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath1 if only loops containing sm particles are present .",
    "we define @xmath25 and @xmath26 to be the ratio of these couplings so computed to the sm (  @xmath27 ) values .",
    "however , in some of our fits we will also allow for additional loop contributions @xmath28 and @xmath29 from new particles ; in this case @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "limits on `` invisible '' higgs decays from global fits to lhc data were obtained previously in  @xcite and within the mssm in  @xcite . since then , much more data has become available .",
    "we therefore find it worthwhile to re - investigate the status of invisible decays .",
    "moreover , we consider more general deviations from sm couplings than the previous works .    the possibility of probing directly the ( genuine ) invisible branching fraction of the higgs in various channels at the lhc has been investigated already some time ago  @xcite .",
    "it was revisited more recently in light of the 125  gev higgs signal at the lhc in  @xcite .",
    "the channels considered were monojets or 2 jets plus missing energy .",
    "associated production , leading to high-@xmath32 @xmath33 s plus missing energy .",
    "however , stronger limits were obtained from monojet searches . ]",
    "these make it possible to constrain the product of the higgs production cross section in the gluon ",
    "gluon fusion ( ggf ) , or vector boson fusion ( vbf ) and vh associated production modes , times the invisible branching fraction . specifically , they put constraints on @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ". we will not include these direct limits in our fits but will comment on the impact of these probes on the valid parameter space . probing yet undetected",
    "@xmath13 decays ( with the pseudoscalars further decaying in various channels ) was discussed in  @xcite  results depend strongly on the manner in which the @xmath14 decays .",
    "the results of our global fits are presented in section  2 . in section  3 , we discuss further probes of invisible or undetected decays . in the case of higgs",
    "decays into dm particles , a strong interplay with direct dm searches arises .",
    "this is discussed in section  4 .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in section  5 .",
    "distributions for the branching ratio of invisible higgs decays . the full , dashed , and dotted lines correspond , respectively , to the cases of 1 ) sm couplings , 2 ) arbitrary @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and 3 )  deviations of @xmath36 from unity . in addition",
    ", we show as dash - dotted line the variant of case 3 ) with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "[ fig : onedim ] ]    as mentioned , we consider several cases in our analysis .",
    "we start the discussion with the simplest case , case 1 ) , of an sm higgs boson augmented by invisible / undetected decays ,  we require that all couplings be equal to the sm values ( @xmath39 ) but allow for ( yet ) invisible decays of the higgs state in addition to the normal decays to sm particles .",
    "we first recall that , for the most part , the observed rates in many production - decay channels are not far from the sm - predictions and , in particular , are not suppressed .",
    "in addition , there are a few final states that have a somewhat enhanced rate relative to the sm , most notably the @xmath8 final state . since invisible decays reduce the branching ratio to the ( visible ) sm final states , it is to be expected that @xmath40 is strongly limited .",
    "this is confirmed in our fit .",
    "we find that @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) at @xmath7 ( @xmath43 ) .",

    "the @xmath44 at the minimum is @xmath45 ,  the same as for the sm  @xcite . with 20 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . )",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath9-value of @xmath46 , as compared to a @xmath9-value of @xmath47 for the pure sm ( 21  d.o.f . ) .",
    "let us now turn to case 2 ) , where we allow for extra loop contributions to the @xmath24 and @xmath8 couplings of the higgs boson , denoted @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "such loops would involve particles beyond those present in the sm .",
    "if these bsm particles receive mass from the higgs mechanism , then they will give contributions to @xmath28 and @xmath29 that approach a constant value as their mass increases in size  they do not decouple .",
    "allowing for arbitrary @xmath28 and @xmath29 the minimum @xmath44 decreases from the sm fit value of @xmath48 to @xmath49 with the best values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 for a non - zero value of the invisible rate , @xmath52 .",

    "this amounts to taking @xmath185     as a function of the mass of the dm particle , for @xmath186 ( from bottom to top ) for the case of a majorana @xmath162 ( left panel ) or a real scalar @xmath168 ( right panel ) when @xmath187 and @xmath188 ,  an sm higgs plus invisible decays .",

    "[ brinv - sigmasi ] for a majorana fermion ( left panel ) and a real scalar ( right panel ) assuming @xmath187 .",
    "as can be seen , for a majorana fermion the current xenon100 limits  @xcite exclude , for example , @xmath189 when @xmath190 . for scalar dm , the cross sections are larger , and xenon100 excludes @xmath189 for @xmath191  gev .",
    "these limits become much stronger when @xmath105 and/or @xmath192 are large provided they have the same sign .",
    "further , these limits become stronger when we include a non - zero value of @xmath193 . for example ,",
    "for @xmath194 we find that @xmath184 increases by a factor 1.8 as compared to the case @xmath195 for any given value of @xmath40 .",
    "this increase is due in part to the new contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigsi ] ) and in part because a larger coupling of the dm to the higgs is necessary to maintain a constant value of @xmath40 .",
    "note that imposing universality of quark couplings to the higgs has an impact on our predictions for @xmath184 since all quark flavors contribute to this observable , whereas universality plays basically no role for higgs decays as only the third generation is important .    when @xmath196 and @xmath197 , corresponding to the best fit for case 3 ) , there is a destructive interference between the @xmath198-type and @xmath199-type quark contributions such that @xmath184 is much below the current limit .",
    "note however that a negative sign of @xmath105 would require that @xmath106 is induced dominantly by the vev of a higgs boson which is not the higgs boson considered here ; if such a higgs boson also couples to dark matter it could then contribute significantly to the si cross section . without a complete model for the higgs sector",
    "it is therefore difficult to make generic predictions in this case .",
    "when the dm candidate is a dirac fermion and one assumes the same amount of matter and anti - matter in the early universe , the results for @xmath184 are simply a factor @xmath200 lower then those obtained in the majorana case .",
    "however if this fermion also couples to the @xmath33 , this gives an additional positive contribution to @xmath184 , thus leading to stronger constraints from direct detection experiments .",
    "similar arguments hold for the case of a complex scalar , as compared to a real scalar .",
    "assuming that the 125  gev state observed at the lhc is , indeed , a higgs boson a very important question is whether or not it has decays to non - sm particles that escape undetected .",
    "truly invisible decays include , for instance ,",
    "@xmath201  lsp+lsp ( the lsp being the lightest supersymmetric particle in r - parity conserving supersymmetry and a dm candidate ) while undetected , but not intrinsically invisible , decays are typified by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a light pseudoscalar of an extended higgs sector . in these and many other cases , `` invisible '' @xmath23 decays provide a portal to bsm physics that might prove hard to detect in any other way .    in this paper , we have assessed the extent to which currently available data constrain invisible ( or undetected ) @xmath23 decays . by performing fits to all public data from the lhc and the tevatron experiments , we have shown that the 95% cl limits for @xmath40 obtained depend very much upon the higgs sector model . assuming a higgs boson with sm couplings , @xmath202 is allowed at 95%  cl . allowing the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath1",
    "reduced coupling factors ( that are defined as the coefficients multiplying the up - quark , down - quark and vector boson couplings relative to the sm values ) to deviate from unity , much larger invisible decay rates are possible . in the most theoretically motivated case where @xmath90 , @xmath203 and @xmath94 the latter being required for any two - doublet or two - doublet plus singlets model  we find @xmath204 at 95%  cl .",
    "limits on invisible ( or yet undetected ) higgs decays also depend strongly on whether or not there are bsm particles that provide extra loop contributions to the @xmath24 and @xmath8 couplings of the @xmath23 . in the simplest case of an sm - like higgs with bsm loop contributions to its @xmath24 and @xmath8 couplings , the invisible decay rate can go up to about 60% at 95%  cl .    in the absence of invisible decays ,",
    "the best fits to the lhc data suggest significant deviations of @xmath18 and/or @xmath205 from unity .",
    "we have shown that including the additional possibility of invisible / undetected @xmath23 decays makes even larger deviations accompanied by large @xmath40 values consistent with lhc observations .",
    "if @xmath40 really were as large as the @xmath7 limits we derived , one might hope that direct detection of invisible and/or hard - to - detect @xmath23 decays would be possible .",
    "estimates suggest that @xmath206 at @xmath153 will typically be required .",
    "finally , we have also shown that if @xmath207 is due to @xmath23 decays to a pair of dm particles , there are significant constraints on the size of @xmath40 from the non - observation of spin - independent dm scattering on nucleons , the most important such limits currently being those from the xenon100 experiment .",
    "these constraints are much stronger for scalar dm than for majorana or dirac fermions .",
    "overall , our results suggest a continued competition between limits on @xmath184 and those on @xmath40 as direct detection experiments achieve improved sensitivity and increasingly accurate measurements of the properties of the @xmath23 become available with future lhc running .    in short , precision measurements of the properties of the @xmath23 could well continue to provide the strongest constraints on a number of types of bsm physics , including the existence of light ( mass @xmath208 ) weakly interacting massive or hard - to - detect bsm particles .",
    "while this paper was being refereed , atlas and cms presented major updates of their higgs results based on @xmath209  fb@xmath113 of data in most channels . taking these new results into account , we find @xmath210 at 95%  cl for a higgs boson with sm couplings , and @xmath211 at 95%  cl when @xmath90 , @xmath203 and @xmath94 are left free to vary  @xcite .",
