    "long before the development of general relativity , john michell wondered about the gravitational influence of objects on the light they emit , and how one might go about finding objects so dense that light could not escape their surfaces . `` [ i]f any other luminous bodies should happen to revolve about them we might still perhaps from the motions of these revolving bodies infer the existence of the central ones with some degree of probability , as this might afford a clue to some of the apparent irregularities of the revolving bodies , which would not be easily explicable on any other hypothesis '' @xcite .",
    "more than 200 years later , precisely this method has been employed to determine the mass of the black hole ( bh ) at the center of our milky way .",
    "sgr  a@xmath10 is one of the most tightly constrained bhs in the universe , with a total mass uncertainty ( statistical and systematic ) of less than 10% ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "using stellar motions to measure the bh masses in more distant galaxies is complicated by our current inability to spatially resolve the orbits of individual stars .",
    "instead , one must rely on the luminosity - weighted line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) within different spatial resolution elements , and model the most likely contribution to the gravitational potential from the unseen bh ( beyond that provided by the stars themselves and any dark matter ) .",
    "the most common numerical approach to constraining the bh mass ( @xmath0 ) and mass - to - light ratio of the stars ( @xmath11 ) is the orbit superposition method of @xcite , which simultaneously optimizes the fit to the surface brightness distribution and the line - of - sight kinematics of stars within the nuclear region .",
    "application of that technique has yielded more than 50 bh mass estimates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a complimentary mass scale has been developed for the bhs in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , based on the technique of reverberation mapping ( rm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "measuring the size - scale and velocity of gas near the bh has provided mass estimates for @xmath1250 bhs @xcite , but systematic uncertainties remain due to the unknown geometry and dynamics of the gas .",
    "this uncertainty is traditionally encapsulated in a scaling ( or projection ) factor , @xmath13 an empirical calibration for the rm mass scale @xmath14 has been established by assuming that those agns also lie on the tight correlation between bh mass and bulge stellar velocity dispersion ( the @xmath15 relation ) found in quiescent galaxies .",
    "this was first done by @xcite , who obtained an average rm mass scale of @xmath16 .",
    "subsequent determinations have ranged from @xmath17 @xcite to @xmath18 @xcite , with the most recent value being @xmath19 @xcite . for ngc  4151 , this gives a current rm - derived bh mass of @xmath20  ( based on the revised estimate of * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to note that the error generally quoted on a rm - derived bh mass in an individual galaxy is the formal uncertainty in the virial product and does not include the uncertainty in the nominal mean scale factor @xmath21 .",
    "what has been missing is an independent bh mass measurement for a sample of galaxies with rm estimates .",
    "early results have suggested that the empirically calibrated rm masses are consistent with the values produced by other techniques @xcite , but the few agns near enough to be probed by stellar dynamics have not yielded particularly tight constraints ( in part , owing to the complicating factor of the bright agn overwhelming the stellar absorption features at the smallest galactic radii ) . while only a few galaxies lend themselves to multiple methods for measuring the masses of their central bhs , such independent bh mass determinations are crucial to isolating the systematic errors inherent in each method .",
    "it is only via independent measurements that it is possible to derive robust bh masses .",
    "ngc  4151 is a particularly interesting galaxy since it is one of the rare objects for which there already exist two independent dynamical measurements for the mass of the bh .",
    "@xcite use optical spectroscopy of stellar absorption lines and orbit superposition modeling to derive an upper limit for the bh mass of @xmath22 when the galactic bulge is assumed to be edge - on .",
    "when the bulge is assumed to have the same inclination as the large - scale disk , they derive a bh mass of 4 - 5@xmath23 , which they caution is likely to be a biased solution since it is associated with a very noisy @xmath1 surface that also gives a poor fit to the data ( in terms of absolute @xmath1 value ) .",
    "@xcite use adaptive optics ( ao ) to obtain high spatial resolution , near - infrared spectroscopy of the molecular , ionized , and highly ionized gas in ngc  4151 . from the kinematics of gas in the vicinity of the bh",
    ", they derive a dynamical mass of @xmath24 for the bh .",
    "being somewhat smaller than the value obtained by @xcite , this suggests a need to revisit the stellar dynamical bh mass measurement .    two serious concerns with the result of @xcite",
    "motivate the need for the high spatial resolution observations that are presented in this paper .",
    "first , based on the rm mass and the bh mass derived by @xcite , the sphere of influence of the bh is estimated to be @xmath25 , significantly smaller than the spatial resolution of the spectra used by @xcite .",
    "second , low spatial resolution integral field spectroscopy of a larger field of view @xcite shows that the true kinematic major axis of the bulge ( derived from the 2d velocity field ) is oriented @xmath26 from the axis assumed by @xcite .",
    "the observations and modeling presented in this paper are designed to overcome both of these drawbacks and to provide a more robust comparison with the gas dynamical measurement of @xcite .    to enhance the comparison between the rm and stellar dynamical mass scales for bhs",

    "ngc  4151 is a nearby ( @xmath27 ) galaxy with a prominent bulge , faint spiral arms and a large scale bar ( see sections 3.4 and 3.5 for more details on the morphology and distance of the galaxy ) .",
    "the galaxy s nuclear activity has been studied extensively since the original paper by seyfert ( 1943 ) ; in particular , the analysis of uv and optical emission lines have been used for determining the bh mass via rm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the analysis presented here uses new near - ir spectroscopy performed with ao , as well as previously published optical long - slit spectroscopy , and space- and ground - based imaging ( primarily from * ? ? ?",

    ".      observations of ngc  4151 and three giant stars ( used as velocity templates ) were obtained with the near - infrared integral field spectrograph ( nifs ; * ? ? ? * ) on gemini north between 16 feb 2008 and 24 feb 2008 in queue mode ( program i d gn-2008a - q-41 ) .",
    "the nifs image - slicing integral field unit ( ifu ) provides @xmath28 near - ir spectra across a @xmath29 field , with a spatial sampling of @xmath30 , or @xmath31 `` spaxels '' ( spatial pixels ) , where the smaller pixel scale is along each of the 29 image slices .",
    "because previous observations of the k - band stellar absorption lines in ngc  4151 show the features to be weak in the central regions @xcite , we focus on the co  ( 6 - 3 ) bandhead at a rest - frame wavelength of 1.62  @xmath32 m , which has been found to be quite prominent in previous nifs spectra @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-band spectra cover a wavelength range of @xmath33m@xmath34 m ( centered at 1.6490  @xmath32 m ) , with a dispersion of 1.60    pixel@xmath35 across the 2040 spectral pixels , and a velocity resolution of 56.8  .",
    "to take advantage of the spatial sampling afforded by nifs , the observations were taken with the altair ao system @xcite , using the agn in ngc  4151 as the ao guide star .",
    "the observations employed the altair field lens @xcite to provide a more uniform point spread function ( psf ) across the nifs field .",
    "the level of ao correction depends upon the prevailing seeing conditions at the time .",
    "the median uncorrected seeing was @xmath36 , and more than 95% of the data were obtained in seeing better than @xmath37 , which provided an ao - corrected nuclear fwhm between @xmath38 and @xmath39 . to estimate the psf",
    ", we model the contribution from the agn to the spectrum in each spaxel across the field of view , taking advantage of the agn s strong [ ]  @xmath40 m emission line , at an observed wavelength of @xmath41 m .",
    "although the [ ] emission is spatially extended in ngc  4151 , the off - nuclear emission line is narrower than the nuclear line profile , and tight constraints can be placed on the amount of agn spectrum that ends up in each spaxel ( see   4.2 of * ? ? ?",
    "the analysis was restricted to a wavelength region around the [ ] line ( @xmath42m@xmath43 m ) , and to control the effects of noise , the spectra were box - car smoothed over 5 pixels .",
    "a slice was taken through the center of the resulting 2d map , cutting along the smaller pixel scale ( @xmath44 ) .",

    "the typical observing sequence included a 9-point dither pattern with separations of 0206 , and offsets to a sky field ( 210  away ) approximately every third frame .",
    "individual exposures were 120  s long , and the observations were split into sequences of 80 minutes in duration ( in some instances , shortened by changing weather conditions ) .",
    "arc lamps were taken in the middle of each observing sequence , and telluric standards were obtained before and after each sequence .",
    "the telluric stars were chosen to be 2mass sources to simultaneously provide photometric calibration : hd  98152 was observed before ngc  4151 , and hd  116405 afterwards .",
    "darks , flats , and ronchi mask calibrations were obtained during the daytime after each night s science observations . in total , 253 on - source frames",
    "were obtained , for a total exposure time of 30360  s. a total of 112 sky frames were also acquired .",
    "the giant stars we observed were included so as to provide a measure of the spectral broadening of the instrument , allowing the intrinsically narrow - featured stars to serve as templates that could be broadened to match the actual stellar velocity distribution of ngc  4151 .",
    "these velocity template stars were observed without ao , and were selected to span a range of spectral type : hd  35833 ( g0 ) , hd  40280 ( ) , hip  60145 ( m0 ) .",
    "the observations of each star consist of four on - source and two sky exposures , each with an integration time of 5.3  s.      the nifs data were reduced with a combination of version 1.9.1 of the gemini iraf package and our own iraf scripts .",
    "calibrations were processed independently for each night .",
    "the observations of ngc  4151 were grouped by proximity to a telluric standard , typically dividing the observing sequence in half .",
    "the data were flat - fielded , dark - subtracted , wavelength - calibrated , and spatially rectified , then combined , corrected for telluric features , and flux - calibrated .",
    "the flux calibration provided by the two telluric / flux standards differs systematically by @xmath48% , implying a 0.3  mag discrepancy in the 2mass photometry for the two stars .",
    "because the absolute flux levels in the nifs data play no role in our subsequent analysis , we do not attempt to correct for this offset .",
    "since the image quality of some frames is significantly worse than others , we select a subsample of individual frames with fwhm values below a certain upper limit . with a threshold of 016 in the fwhm ( measured at a uniform wavelength of 1.6598  @xmath32 m to avoid emission features in the spectra ) ,",
    "236 frames are included in the final datacube .",
    "we spatially shift the data to account for the dither pattern and then median - combine the images , yielding a datacube containing 29@xmath4969  spatial pixels and 2040 spectral pixels .",
    "the near - ir spectra at each spatial position in the final nifs datacube are combined onto a bin of size @xmath1202-square ( 2@xmath495 raw spaxels ) , resulting in a cube of 15@xmath4915 spaxels .",
    "this choice of binning the spaxels arose from two main considerations .",
    "first , prior to carrying out the axisymmetric dynamical modeling , the kinematic data need to be symmetrized about the kinematic major axis and reflected about the rotation axis , to avoid modeling inconsistencies .",
    "this process is best accomplished with square bins , especially when the symmetry axes of the galaxy are not aligned with the axes of the spectrograph ( as is generally the case ) .",
    "second , since the halo of the psf has @xmath46 and this component comprises 50% of the overall psf amplitude , the spatial resolution of the data is not significantly altered by using larger bins .",
    "we reduce the observations of the telluric / flux standard stars and the velocity template stars with procedures similar to those we apply to the ngc  4151 data .",
    "we median - combine the four frames for each star , extract spectra with a fixed aperture of 1@xmath505 , and then we normalize each extracted spectrum for the velocity template stars by a low - order fit to the continuum .",
    "in addition to the new data from nifs , we utilize the results from the optical spectra of ngc  4151 that were analyzed in paper  i. the data consist of long - slit spectra of the calcium triplet region ( @xmath51 ) taken with the mayall 4  m telescope at kitt peak national observatory in 2001 , and with the 6.5  m mmt observatory at mt .",
    "hopkins in 2004 . for the data from kitt peak , the spectroscopic slit was 2wide and was placed at a position angle of 135@xmath52 . to enhance the signal - to - noise",
    ", spectra were extracted with an aperture that increased in size away from the galaxy center , extending to radii of @xmath5314 .",
    "the spectral resolution was @xmath54  .",
    "for the observations with the mmt , the slit was 1  wide , at a position angle of 69@xmath52 .",

    "to model the surface brightness profile of ngc  4151 in the near - ir , we make use of the @xmath2-band imaging from the early data release of the ohio state university bright spiral galaxy survey ( osubsgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "the data were obtained with the 1.8  m perkins telescope at lowell observatory .",
    "the image has a plate scale of 15  pixel@xmath35 , and we estimate the seeing to be 2 .",
    "we photometrically calibrate the osubsgs imaging using 2mass point - sources in the field , deriving a photometric zero - point of @xmath57  mag .",
    "to bridge the gap in the surface brightness information between the small field - of - view of the ao - assisted nifs data and the large - scale low resolution imaging data of the osubsgs , we use the _ hubble space telescope _",

    "the images have an exposure time of 53.9  s in each band , with 0396 pixels and @xmath1210-seeing in both filters .",
    "we use the photometrically calibrated and sky - subtracted images that sdss makes available .",
    "as in paper  i , our modeling relies on simultaneously fitting both the luminosity distribution of the bulge and the observed integrated line - of - sight velocity distributions ( losvd ) of stars obtained with various spectrographs over a range of spatial scales .",
    "we detail below the methods of deriving those quantities from the data described above .      as discussed in [ sec : nifs_details ] , the nifs instrument produces a grid of spatial pixels ( `` spaxels '' ) of size @xmath30 which were combined onto a bin of size 02-square , resulting in a cube of 15@xmath4915 spaxels . the spectrum from each binned spaxel",
    "is then analyzed using the `` penalized pixel fitting '' ( ppxf ) package for idl by @xcite .",
    "the ppxf routine computes the velocity shift , the velocity dispersion , and the higher - order moments of the stellar losvds ( parameterized as gauss - hermite ( gh ) polynomials ) that , when convolved with the velocity template star spectrum , provide the best match to the observed data .",
    "the software allows emission features to be masked in the fit , and also provides for multiplicative and additive polynomials to be included ( which we use to account for the contribution of the agn continuum ) .",
    "our ppxf analysis fits the losvd up to 4th - order gh terms , including 2nd - order multiplicative and additive polynomials , and fits the spectra over the wavelength range @xmath60m@xmath61 m , with four small wavelength gaps around agn emission lines and residual sky features .",
    "figure  [ fig.spec ] shows four example spectra and ppxf fits , from different positions within the datacube .",
    "we obtain the smallest uncertainties on the kinematic parameters when we fit the agn spectra with the m0 velocity template , and allowing simultaneous use of all three templates does not measurably improve the results .",
    "we also compared the velocity measurements to those obtained when using nifs velocity templates ( spectral types , , , and a ) acquired by watson et al .",
    "( 2008 ; gemini program gn-2006b - sv-110 ) .",
    "the m - type stars provided better matches to the relative strengths of the absorption lines in each ngc  4151 spectrum , and the kinematic uncertainties were smaller than for the k - type stars .",
    "compared to the kinematics derived from our m0 velocity template , the differences were typically less than 1@xmath4 , suggesting our fits are robust against the effects of template - mismatch .",
    "our results are consistent with those of @xcite , who found better matches to @xmath2-band galaxy spectra with m - type stars than with k - type stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : vel_fields_orig ]  ( top row ) shows maps of the line - of - sight velocity ( @xmath62 ) , velocity dispersion ( @xmath63 ) , and the 3rd and 4th gh moments ( @xmath64 ) in 02 spaxels .",

    "this procedure enhances the s / n by combining the measurements on either side of the kinematic minor axis in a symmetric ( @xmath63 and @xmath67 ) , or anti - symmetric ( @xmath62 and @xmath66 ) way .",
    "data point is multiplied by -1 and averaged with the @xmath66 value at a position mirrored on the opposite side of the bh .",
    "] such a procedure is necessary in order to obtain sensible results from an axisymmetric dynamical modeling code , which assumes such an underlying symmetry .",
    "the kinematic data were bi - symmetrized in a weighted mean , using the individual uncertainties reported by ppxf to derive the weights .",

    "figure  [ fig : nifs_sau ] shows the line - of - sight stellar velocity fields from nifs ( left ) and sauron ( right ) .",
    "the latter data are from @xcite and show a similar large scale rotational velocity to that seen in the inner 3@xmath493  region observed with nifs .",
    "although the large scale line - of - sight velocity fields in both panels show the same global rotational velocity , the central region of the sauron velocity field within  5@xmath49 5  ( right ) is dominated by agn continuum .",
    "therefore , the innermost parts allow no velocity measurement , and appear as a black oval region in the image .",
    "thus , the sauron data do not provide constraints on the bh mass , although they could provide constraints on the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "however , we do not include the sauron data in our modeling , relying instead on the long - slit kinematics obtained from mmt and kpno to provide the constraints on @xmath11 at large radii .",
    "this is partly a pragmatic choice since the use of ifu data on both small and large scales would significantly increase the total number of kinematic constraints that would need to be fitted and , therefore , would require a significantly larger orbit library than we use here , making the problem significantly more computationally expensive than we are able to handle .",

    "our use of the optical data could potentially bias the surface brightness profile we derive if there are significant variations in extinction or stellar population at radii of @xmath72 .",
    "however , there are no independent indications of stellar population changes in that part of ngc  4151 , and the radial profile of the acs image is relatively smooth at those distances .",

    "we derive a stellar flux profile directly from the nifs datacube .",
    "one of the outputs of the ppxf modeling is the derived amplitude of the stellar template that best matches the galaxy data . as our template spectra are continuum - normalized , these amplitudes constitute relative measurements of the stellar flux in each spaxel , calculated in a way that naturally omits the agn contribution to the light profile .",
    "the unbinned data are used to probe radii of 0@xmath73 ( excluding the agn - dominated central spaxel ) . the overall nifs stellar profile",

    "[ fig:1dchi2 ] )  clearly _ underestimates _ the nifs velocity dispersion ( top right panel ) for the central - most points .",
    "the uniformly large central @xmath226 values in the inner @xmath227 region are much better fitted by larger values of @xmath228 and @xmath218 ( blue curve ) .",
    "both the models do an equally good job of fitting , , and @xmath66 from the mmt data , but overestimate  from the kpno data .",
    "another important point to note is that the values of the gh parameters @xmath67 are _ negative _ in the innermost regions of each of the three datasets .",
    "neither model is able to fit the negative @xmath67 values measured with the mmt spectrograph nor the central dips to negative values in @xmath67 seen in the nifs data and kpno data .    in spherical and axisymmetric galaxies ,",
    "@xmath67 is negative when the velocity distribution is tangentially biased ; it is positive when orbits are predominantly radial ; and it is zero when the velocity distribution in isotropic @xcite .",
    "however , negative @xmath67 values have also been associated specifically with the presence of a bar . in recent @xmath229-body simulations of barred galaxies by @xcite ,",
    "the losvds have negative @xmath67 values in the region where the bar dominates .",
    "the negative @xmath67 parameters arise due to the kinematic properties of the special orbits that constitute the bar , and due to the fact that from an external observer s point of view , the bar has a large tangential velocity component due to its pattern speed . even after a bar buckles and forms a boxy bulge ,",
    "negative @xmath67 values can be seen in face - on systems @xcite .",
    "another signature of the kinematics associated with a nuclear bar is undulations in the rising part of the inner rotation curve @xcite , which we also see in the mmt data for ngc  4151 . finally ,",
    "while @xmath66 is always anti - correlated with the line - of - sight velocity  in axisymmetric systems , @xcite show that @xmath66 is _ correlated _ with  along the major axis of the bar . for the data obtained with kpno ( where the slit lies along the major axis of the large scale bar ) @xmath66",
    "is correlated with  over the radial range @xmath230 ( figure  [ fig : kinematics_90_1d ] ) , providing additional kinematical evidence for a bar .",
    "therefore it appears that despite the very circular photometric contours of the bulge in ngc  4151 , and the visual appearance of a rather weak bar at radii outside the bulge , there are several clear kinematical signatures of a small scale bar in the vicinity of the nuclear bh .",
    "this is consistent with the properties of `` barlens '' features that have recently been identified in real and simulated galaxies @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite , barlenses frequently masquerade as classical bulges because of their nearly circular central isophotes , especially when viewed nearly face - on , but have bar - like kinematics",
    ".    the combination of bars and bhs can have significant implications for the central dynamics of galaxies . @xcite",
    "analyze a suite of @xmath229-body simulations of barred galaxies in which point masses representing bhs were grown adiabatically .",
    "they find that the growth of a bh of a given mass causes a 5 - 10% larger increase in @xmath63 in a barred galaxy than in an otherwise identical axisymmetric galaxy .",
    "@xcite find that if a disk galaxy with a bulge has a pre - existing black hole , the formation and evolution of a bar can result in a 15 - 40% increase in the central velocity dispersion .",
    "both studies find that the increase in the observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion in the barred systems is a consequence of three separate factors : ( a ) mass inflow due to angular momentum transport by the bar , ( b ) velocity anisotropy due to the presence of bar orbits , and ( c ) weak dependence on orientation of position angle of the bar .",
    "if ngc  4151 does have a bar and is thus non - axisymmetric , that fact also has implications for our modeling results . in stellar dynamical modeling of axisymmetric galaxies ,",
    "fitting a negative @xmath67 requires a larger fraction of tangential orbits , which contribute little to the line - of - sight velocity dispersion . fitting a given velocity dispersion with such an orbit population",
    "will imply a larger enclosed mass than would be required if @xmath67 was zero or positive ( which is typically the case in axisymmetric systems with bhs ) .",
    "@xcite argue that if an axisymmetric stellar dynamical modeling code is used to derive the value of @xmath0 in a barred galaxy with a high central @xmath231 and a negative @xmath67 , the central bh mass will be systematically overestimated .",
    "if the large values of @xmath231 in the nuclear regions and the negative @xmath67 values in the mmt data are a consequence a nuclear bar , then the discrepancy between @xmath127 and @xmath125 could reflect this predicted bias in @xmath0 .      in this section",
    "we examine the consequences of fitting only the nifs kinematical data ( ignoring the kinematical constraints at larger radii obtained from the lower spatial resolution long - slit spectra from kpno and mmt ) .",
    "there are three reasons why the nifs data alone may provide better constraints on the mass of the bh .",
    "first , the nifs data have higher spatial resolution ( 02 ) than the long slit data ( 1 - 2 ) . for",
    "a @xmath232 , the sphere - of - influence of the bh ( assuming @xmath233  ; see section  [ sec : msigma ] below ) is @xmath1216  pc , which corresponds to @xmath12 024 for our assumed distance of 13.9  mpc for this galaxy .",
    "therefore the nifs data used in our modeling are barely able to resolve the sphere - of - influence of the bh , but are quite close to doing so .",
    "if @xmath234 , the sphere - of - influence of the bh would be 26  pc ( 038 ) and the bh sphere - of - influence would be resolved by the nifs data .",
    "the long slit data do not provide constraints on @xmath0 and are included mainly to provide constraints on the mass - to - light ratio of the stars , which is assumed to be independent of radius .",
    "second , as discussed previously , the nifs velocity dispersion within @xmath235 is significantly larger than the velocity dispersion on same physical scale obtained from the long - slit data .",
    "however , since the error bars on the long - slit mmt data are about half those from the nifs data , the optimization code tries to fit them better than the nifs data .    in figure",
    "[ fig : kinenifs_90 ] ( top two panels ) , the need to fit the lower velocity dispersion values from mmt manifests as low velocity dispersion values ( blue ) at the edges of the nifs field .",
    "these low dispersion values outside the sphere - of - influence of the bh also force the model to adopt a lower mass - to - light ratio , which is then compensated for in the inner region by requiring a much larger to fit the nifs velocity dispersion . neglecting the long - slit data",
    "would allow the optimization code to raise the mass - to - light ratio in the inner @xmath532   region ( where the velocity dispersion is quite flat ) .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig : kinematics_90_1d ] , we see kinematic evidence for the bar in mmt and kpno long - slit data ( negative @xmath67 values and undulations in the rising part of the rotation curve seen in mmt data ; correlation between @xmath66 and @xmath236  in kpno data ) occurring on scales of 3 - 5 , well outside the nuclear region . except for the central value of @xmath67 in the nifs dataset ( which , as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig.spec ] , is contaminated by the agn ) , all the other @xmath67 values are positive , which is what is expected for orbits around a central bh . neglecting the long - slit kinematical data could help overcome biases introduced by the bar kinematics . assuming that the bh mass should primarily be constrained by kinematic constraints at the smallest radii we now test the effect of not including the long - slit data in the nnls optimization problem .",
    "the expectation is that neglecting the long - slit data should bring the best - fit solutions obtained from @xmath183 and @xmath178 closer to each other .",
    "we construct a full sets of models ( 18 values of @xmath0 and 18 values of @xmath95 ) in which we only fitted the nuclear kinematical data obtained with the nifs spectrograph , with an orbit library of @xmath211 .",
    "figure  [ fig : nifs_only ] shows @xmath138 values obtained by marginalizing over @xmath95 ( top ) and by marginalizing over @xmath0 ( middle ) .",
    "the solid curves show @xmath237 while the dashed curves show @xmath238 .",
    "the dotted horizontal lines show the 1@xmath4 , 2@xmath4 and 3@xmath4 confidence levels , respectively ( for 1 degree - of - freedom ) .",
    "the top plot shows that the minimum @xmath178 ( dashed curve ) has decreased quite significantly and is now in agreement with the minimum @xmath183 ( solid curve ) .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath95 ( middle panel ) are still inconsistent within 1@xmath4 but are consistent within 3@xmath4 .",
    "the bottom - most panel shows the error on the fit to the mass and surface brightness distribution .",
    "contours are spaced at intervals of 0.1% error per constraint .",
    "it is clear that the fit to the self - consistency constraints is uniform over a much larger range of @xmath0 and @xmath95 values implying that the fit to the mass is no longer a significant factor in determining the location of the minimum .",
    "the best fit black hole mass and m / l ratio obtained using @xmath237 and @xmath238 , along with the reduced @xmath138 and 1@xmath4 and 3@xmath4 error bars , are shown in the bottom two rows of table  [ tab : robustbestfit ] . since the best fit @xmath0 values and their 1@xmath4 error bars from both methods of computing @xmath1 are nearly the same we use the average of the two best - fit values as the solution and sum their 1@xmath4 errors in quadrature to obtain @xmath239 .",
    "figure  [ fig : nifs_only ] shows that the @xmath95 values obtained from @xmath178 are consistent with the best fit value obtained with @xmath183 at the 3@xmath4 level , but both are well within the expected range @xmath240 .",
    "therefore we use the average of the two best - fit m / l values and sum their 3@xmath4 errors in quadrature to get @xmath241 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : kinenifs_90 ] shows a 2d kinematic map for a model with @xmath219 and @xmath242 , with parameters closest to the best - fit solution obtained with @xmath125 ( see 3rd row of table  [ tab : robustbestfit ] ) .",
    "this model achieves adequately large values of @xmath231 ( see red / orange regions ) over the central nifs field by raising the m / l ratio very slightly from @xmath243 to @xmath244 .",
    "the 1d kinematic fit of this model to the nifs data along the kinematic major axis of the model is shown by the green curves in figure  [ fig : kinematics_90_1d ] , from which it is also clear that the lower value of @xmath0 is able to fit the high velocity dispersion values even better than the high bh mass when the model attempted to fit both the nifs and long - slit kinematic data .",
    "this test largely confirms our hypothesis that the two main causes of the large value of @xmath0 obtained in the previous section were ( a ) inconsistencies between @xmath231 values from nifs and the long - slit data in the same spatial region , ( b ) the need to fit the low @xmath67 values and high central @xmath231  values with a low m / l ratio .",
    "thus , we see that by not including the kinematics data with poorer spatial resolution ( which are clearly unaffected by the bh as can be seen in figure  [ fig : kinenifs_90 ] ) we are able to simultaneously fit the nifs kinematics and the mass and surface brightness distributions with a lower value of @xmath0 .      in this section ,",
    "we determine how the new nifs kinematic measurements in the nuclear region of ngc  4151 affect the galaxy s location in the @xmath15 relation .",
    "the aperture used to define the appropriate @xmath4 value for the relation is a historically contentious issue ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the nifs data naturally lend themselves to one of those standards : @xmath245 , which is the velocity dispersion within an aperture of radius @xmath246/8 , where @xmath246 is the bulge effective radius @xcite .",
    "( despite having to adopt one particular standard , we note that @xcite found no systematic differences between estimates of @xmath245 ( inside of @xmath246/8 ) and estimates of @xmath4 that extended out to @xmath246 , likely because of the steep radial surface brightness gradient in most bulges . )",
    "the @xmath246 value for ngc  4151 has been measured to be @xmath247 @xcite , while the nifs field - of - view extends to a radius of between @xmath86 and @xmath248 .",
    "thus , we sum the nifs datacube across all of the spaxels into a single spectrum , and fit for the dispersion using ppxf .    from the nifs data , we find @xmath249  .",
    "this is somewhat larger than either the @xmath250  measured by @xcite , or the @xmath251  measured by @xcite . both of those earlier measurements used the calcium triplet absorption lines , but whereas the former covered a similar region of the galaxy as our nifs spectra ( @xmath252 ) , the latter used an aperture of @xmath253 .",
    "previous studies of bulge kinematics have found near - ir and optical data to give consistent results ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , while the discrepancies seen in some luminous ir galaxies are in the sense of _ smaller _ @xmath4 values from the co - bandheads @xcite .",
    "our new measurement of @xmath254  is @xmath1225% above the previous velocity dispersion measurements , while our best - fit stellar dynamical estimate of @xmath255 is 17% below our earlier stellar dynamical estimate @xcite .",
    "previously , ngc  4151 had been an outlier from the agn @xmath15 relation in the direction of low-@xmath4 or high-@xmath0 .",
    "the new @xmath245 and @xmath0 measurements helps to bring ngc  4151 closer to the best - fit relation of @xcite , though it does remain on the low-@xmath4 side .",
    "finally , we note that if the bh masses in barred galaxies have been overestimated due to the use of axisymmetric dynamical modeling codes , such galaxies would lie even further below the standard relation than has been found previously ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of developing robust bar dynamical modeling approaches in the future .",
    "we have conducted ao - assisted near - ir integral field spectroscopy of the local seyfert galaxy ngc  4151 , using the nifs instrument on gemini north .",
    "we used an axisymmetric orbit - superposition code to fit the observed surface brightness distribution within 50 , nifs kinematics within @xmath5315 , and long slit kinematics along two different position angles in order to estimate the best - fit values of the mass of the bh ( @xmath0 ) and the mass - to - light ratio of the stars ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "models were constructed for 10 - 18 values of @xmath0 , 18 values of @xmath95 and 3 different inclination angles .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized below .",
    "we use the @xmath1 estimator to determine the model which gives the best - fit to the data but find that the solution depends on whether the @xmath1 includes both self - consistency constraints ( which are not strictly speaking `` data '' ) and kinematic constraints or only kinematic constraints .",
    "when we use both types of constraints and all the available kinematical data ( from low - resolution long - slit data and high resolution nifs data ) the best - fit solution is @xmath256 and @xmath175 , for a model with @xmath101 .",
    "however , this best fit model gives a central @xmath231 that is too low to fit the data obtained with the nifs instrument .",
    "when we use @xmath127 ( determined by only considering the fit to the kinematic data ) , the best fit model has @xmath257 and @xmath258 , and provides a better fit to the nuclear kinematical data from nifs spectrograph , although it gives a slightly worse fit to the mass and surface brightness distributions .",
    "an interesting point worth noting is that @xcite found a best - fit value of @xmath259 in ngc 4151 when they fitted the kinematics of the h@xmath260 line - emitting gas within 1  of the center ( see figure 43 in their paper ) .",
    "however , if they included the kinematics of gas within 2  they obtained a larger value of @xmath261 , although with a somewhat worse reduced-@xmath1 .",
    "it is intriguing that both our stellar dynamical modeling and their gas dynamical modeling , while preferring lower values of @xmath262 , also suggest that _ higher _ values of @xmath0 may be obtained when lower spatial resolution data are included in the fit .",
    "models are generated for three different inclination angles of the bulge @xmath263 and show that the best - fit @xmath0 and @xmath95 values are relatively insensitive to inclination angle .",
    "we examine an additional 4 inclination angles for fixed bh mass values ( @xmath264 ) and fixed mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath265 ) .",
    "we find that edge - on models ( @xmath101 ) give the smallest @xmath1 values , while models with the inclination of the large scale disk ( @xmath103 ) are strongly disfavored .",
    "this suggests that the bulge must be nearly spherical but its rotation axis is significantly misaligned from the rotation axis of the disk .",
    "however , it is well known from previous work @xcite that inclination of a spheroid is extremely difficult to determine via dynamical modelling , especially in the presence of a bar . this determination of the inclination of the bulge",
    "should therefore be treated with caution .",
    "a detailed examination of the kinematics in the inner 5  of ngc  4151 shows evidence for bar kinematics , which manifest as high values of @xmath231 , low or negative values of @xmath67 and @xmath66 values which are correlated with @xmath236 .",
    "we hypothesize that the discrepancy between the @xmath1 obtained from including all the constraints and that obtained by only including the kinematic constraints is likely a consequence of two factors : ( a ) a stellar bar , which is not possible to model with our axisymmetric code , and ( b ) inconsistencies between the velocity dispersion values obtained from the low - spatial resolution long - slit data and the high spatial resolution nifs data over the same spatial range .",
    "this hypothesis was tested by fitting only the nifs data .",
    "when we fit only the kinematical data obtained with the nifs spectrograph ( neglecting all kinematical constraints beyond @xmath266 - i.e those data that show kinematical evidence for a bar and data that is discrepant with high - resolution nifs data ) , the non - negative optimization problem was able to find a much better fit to the nifs data and the same best - fit @xmath0 was obtained by both methods of computing @xmath1 .",
    "the stellar - dynamical modeling carried out in this paper gives a best - fit value of @xmath267 ( obtained by averaging over the @xmath125 and @xmath127 values in the lower two rows of table  [ tab : robustbestfit ] ) which is consistent at the 1@xmath4 level with the reverberation mapping - based mass of @xmath268 ( 1@xmath4 errors ) obtained by using data from @xcite , but relying on a recently updated empirical calibration of the rm mass scale by @xcite .",
    "the best fit m / l ratio @xmath269 ( 3@xmath4 error ) is consistent with the photometrically derived mass - to - light ratio of @xmath270 .    the new nifs data yields @xmath254 , the velocity dispersion within @xmath271 , which is @xmath1225% larger than previous values , while the new best estimate of @xmath272 17% smaller than but fully consistent with both our previous stellar dynamical upper limit @xcite and the dynamical estimate based on h@xmath260 line - emitting gas @xcite .",
    "the larger value of @xmath245 and smaller value of @xmath0 help to bring ngc  4151 closer to the best - fit relation of @xcite .",
    "the analysis in this paper demonstrates that biased estimates of bh masses can arise when an axisymmetric orbit superposition code is used to model a galaxy with a weak , but kinematically identifiable barred galaxy , possibly resulting in an over - estimate in @xmath0 if the m / l ratio is constrained primarily by data beyond the sphere - of - influence of the bh .",
    "this confirms the prediction made from the recent analysis of @xmath229-body simulations of barred galaxies with bhs by @xcite , and points to the need for new dynamical modeling tools capable of modeling a stellar bar .",
    "when such codes are applied to the existing sample of barred galaxies , our results suggest that it will likely enhance the discrepancy between barred and unbarred galaxies in the @xmath15 relation @xcite .",
    "our modeling of this complex system suggests that the standard practice of fitting kinematical constraints over a large range of radii with a constant mass - to - light ratio ( for exceptions to this practice , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can bias the mass of the central bh and the derived mass - to - light ratio . to some extent",
    ", the biases can be overcome by only considering the kinematics very close to the central bh , although this gives larger errors on the estimated solutions of @xmath0 and @xmath95 .",
    "our tests of robustness demonstrate that the use of such high spatial resolution nuclear kinematical data in such modeling is very valuable .",

    "<S> we present a revised measurement of the mass of the central black hole ( @xmath0 ) in the seyfert  1 galaxy ngc  4151 . </S>",
    "<S> the new stellar dynamical mass measurement is derived by applying an axisymmetric orbit - superposition code to near - infrared integral field data obtained using adaptive optics with the gemini nifs spectrograph . </S>",
    "<S> when our models attempt to fit both the nifs kinematics and additional low spatial resolution kinematics , our results depend sensitively on how @xmath1 is computed  probably a consequence of complex bar kinematics that manifest immediately outside the nuclear region . </S>",
    "<S> the most robust results are obtained when only the high spatial resolution kinematic constraints in the nuclear region are included in the fit . </S>",
    "<S> our best estimates for the bh mass and @xmath2-band mass - to - light ratio are @xmath3 ( 1@xmath4 error ) and @xmath5 ( 3@xmath4 error ) , respectively ( the quoted errors reflect the model uncertainties ) . </S>",
    "<S> our bh mass measurement is consistent with estimates from both reverberation mapping ( @xmath6 ) and gas kinematics ( @xmath7 ; 1@xmath4 errors ) , and our best - fit mass - to - light ratio is consistent with the photometric estimate of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the nifs kinematics give a central bulge velocity dispersion @xmath9  , bringing this object slightly closer to the relation for quiescent galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> although ngc  4151 is one of only a few seyfert  1 galaxies in which it is possible to obtain a direct dynamical bh mass measurement  and thus , an independent calibration of the reverberation mapping mass scale  the complex bar kinematics makes it less than ideally suited for this purpose . </S>"
