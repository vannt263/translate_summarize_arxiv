    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     recent afterglow observations of short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) have provided various information about their environments which can be interpreted as circumstantial evidence linking sgrbs with mergers of compact binaries such as double neutron stars ( ns - ns ) @xcite and black hole - neutron star ( bh - ns ) ( see @xcite for a latest review ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the compact binary merger scenario is challenged by the detection of jet breaks in the afterglow of some sgrbs and the deduced small jet opening angle of @xmath0 .",
    "the formation of such a collimated jet in compact binary merger has not been clarified yet ( see e.g. , ) .",
    "one of the most interesting features in the latest numerical - relativity simulations @xcite is that ns - ns mergers in general are accompanied by a substantial amount of dynamical mass ejection .",
    "interestingly , the excess in near - ir band observed by _",
    "hubble space telescope _ in _ swift _ sgrb 130603b ( @xcite ) is explained by the kilonova / macronova model @xcite provided that a large amount of mass @xmath2 is ejected in the ns - ns merger and it is powered by the radioactivity of r - process nuclei @xcite .",
    "such massive ejecta will have a large impact on the dynamics of the jet and the observed collimation could be naturally explained by their interactions .    in this _ letter _ , we numerically investigate the jet propagation in the material ejected by double neutron star mergers based on a scenario indicated both by our latest numerical - relativity simulations and the observations of sgrb 130603b .",
    "the scenario is summarized as follows ( see fig.[f1 ] ) .",
    "* according to latest numerical relativity simulations adopting equations of state ( eoss ) which are compatible with the recent discovery of massive neutron stars with @xmath3 @xcite , a hypermassive neutron star ( hmns ) is the canonical outcome formed after the ns - ns merger for the typical binary mass ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) @xcite . * during and after the merger",
    "a large amount of mass @xmath6 is ejected ( phase ( ii ) ) .",
    "this size of ejecta is required to explain the kilonova candidate associated with sgrb 130603b . according to our numerical - relativity simulations @xcite ,",
    "the morphology of the ejecta is quasi spherical for the case of the hmns formation .",
    "in particular , the regions along the rotational axis is contaminated significantly by the mass ejection .",
    "* such a large amount of mass can be ejected only if the eos of neutron - star matter is relatively soft @xcite . in this case , the massive ns formed after the merger is expected to collapse to a bh _ within several tens of milli seconds _",
    "( phase ( iii ) ) , forming a massive torus around it .",
    "* after the formation of the bh - torus system , a jet would be launched and it propagates through the expanding merger ejecta ( phase ( iv ) ) .",
    "a sgrb will be produced only if the jet successfully breaks out of the ejecta .",
    "note that our scenario is different from that explored by previous studies based on the newtonian studies , in which the mass ejection is not isotropic but is concentrated along the orbital plane . in this case",
    ", there will be little interaction with the jet and ejecta , and no collimation by the ejecta is expected .",
    "indeed , found no strong collimation by the disk wind ( see also @xcite ) , since their simulations were carried out in rather dilute ejecta ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "after studying the dynamics of the jet in the presence of the expanding ejecta , we discuss the canonical model for explaining a particular event , sgrb 130603b . with the observationally consistent parameter set ,",
    "we show that relativistic jets successfully break out of the dynamical ejecta and travel with the required collimation angle .",
    "for constructing ejecta profile models , the results from numerical relativity are employed as the reference .",
    "we first analyze results in @xcite , and then fit the ejecta profile along the pole by the following formulae as @xmath8 in the above expressions , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 denote the onset time of jet injection ( measured from the merger time ) , radius , rest - mass density , and velocity of ejecta , respectively .",
    "other variables , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are fitting parameters .",
    "the power - law index of density distribution ( @xmath13 ) has more or less dependence on the dynamics of merger , which is in the range @xmath17 .",
    "we choose the middle of this value @xmath18 in this study .",
    "@xmath14 denotes the velocity at the dynamical ejecta front ( we set @xmath19 ) .",
    "@xmath16 denotes the snapshot time at which we refer to the result of numerical relativity merger simulations .",
    "we set @xmath20ms , since the morphology of ejecta has been determined by that time and the outer ejecta continues to be in the homologous expansion phase @xcite . the location of forward shock wave at @xmath16 is denoted as @xmath21 , which is set as @xmath22 cm .",
    "the rest - mass density @xmath23 can be expressed as a function of ejecta mass ( @xmath24 ) as ; @xmath25 where @xmath26 @xmath27 denotes the central remnant mass , which is chosen as @xmath28 , and @xmath29 denotes the escape radius , which is defined as @xmath30 .",
    "the pressure of ejecta is set as @xmath31 with @xmath32 , which is cold enough not to affect the jet and ejecta dynamics .    according to these formulae",
    ", we determine the ejecta profile as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath24 .",
    "we first examine the case of @xmath33 ( see table  [ tab : model ] ) , which is the approximate value of the required mass for explaining the kilonova associated with sgrb 130603b @xcite , and then we study the dependece on @xmath24 ( _ m - m3 , m - m2 - 2 , m - m1 _ ) .",
    "@xmath9 corresponds to the time of jet injection , which is supposed to be the operation timing of the central engine . for this",
    "there are no observational constraints .",
    "we set @xmath34ms as the reference value , since our numerical - relativity simulations predict that the life time of hmns is likely to be several tens of milli seconds to explain the large mass of ejecta @xmath35 as well as the large mass of torus surrounding a black hole . for comparison ,",
    "we study @xmath36ms case for one model ( _ m - ti500 _ , see table  [ tab : model ] ) .    using the ejecta profile obtained above as initial conditions , we perform axisymmetric simulations of jet propagation by employing a relativistic hydrodynamical code @xcite .",
    "we assume that the central engine successfully operates in the vicinity of the compact remnant , and the jet is injected with constant power from the innermost computational boundary . in these simulations , we focus only on exploring the interaction between the jet and ejecta .",
    "therefore , the computational domain covers from @xmath29 to @xmath37 cm .",
    "the canonical jet power is set to be @xmath38erg / s for all models , which is comparable with the average jet power of sgrb 130603b ( see @xcite for the collimation - correlated jet energy and also duration of prompt emission ) .",
    "we also prepare the model _ m - l4 _ for which @xmath39erg / s to study the dependece of the jet luminosity . throughout our simulations",
    ", we use the gamma - law eos with @xmath40 . the initial lorentz factor ( @xmath41 ) and specific enthalpy ( @xmath42 ) are set to @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which result in the terminal lorentz factor as @xmath45 .",
    "the initial jet opening angle ( @xmath46 ) is also not well constrained by observations , and hence we set @xmath47 as the reference value with @xmath48 for the study of dependence on @xmath46 ( _ m - th30 , m - th45 _ ) .",
    "note that @xmath47 is larger than the opening angle of @xmath49 , so that the initial thermal expansion of the jet would not be significant ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "simulations are carried out until the shock reaches the outer boundary or time becomes @xmath50  s after the jet injection .",
    "our models are summarized in table  [ tab : model ] .",
    "starting from the initial moment of jet injection at the chosen post - merger time , the jet begins to burrow through the homologously expanding ejecta with mildly relativistic velocity . in the left two panels of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , we display the density contour maps for _ m - ref _ at the time of jet breakout and the end of our simulation . at a short distance from the inner boundary , the jet structure changes from conical to cylindrical one due to the confinement by the dense ejecta .",
    "the small cross section of the jet head allows the shocked jet matter to escape sideways and generates hot cocoon around the jet . even though the density gradually decreases with the radius , the surrounding cocoon keeps confining the jet near the pole , and eventually the jet head successfully breaks out of the edge of the ejecta .",
    "the overall properties of the interaction between ejecta and jet are very similar to those in the context of the collapsar model @xcite .",
    "a remarkable difference between the jet propagation in the ns - ns ejecta and the stellar mantle is that the background fluid is no longer stationary and expands with time .",
    "the jet head chases the ejecta edge from behind , and needs to catch up with it for the relativistic breakout ; otherwise it would become non - relativistic ejecta and will never produce sgrbs ( see below ) .    for less massive ejecta case ( _ m - m3 _ ) , the jet experiences less confinement and propagates faster than _ m - ref _",
    "( see right panels in fig .",
    "even so , the hot cocoon is formed by the jet - ejecta interaction and works to weakly confine the jet . in order to analyze the cocoon confinement and its degree",
    ", we use the dimensionless jet luminosity parameter ( @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the ambient density above the jet head ) following the study by @xcite . by employing equations ( [ eq : rho])([eq : resc ] ) and imposing the condition @xmath53 , @xmath54 can be roughly estimated as ; @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 and @xmath58 denote the radius of the jet head and the time after the merger , respectively . according to @xcite , ) , but we employ it for a qualitative argument . more detailed analytical criterion is currently under study @xcite . ]",
    "the condition of cocoon confinement is @xmath59 . in the vicinity of @xmath29 ( @xmath60 ) ,",
    "all models ( including _ m - m3 _ ) satisfy the confinement condition , which indicates that the jet undergoes a collimation once at least .",
    "the cocoon pressure decreases with time because the density of ejecta has steep radial gradient ( @xmath61 ) . despite the weakening cocoon pressure ,",
    "the opening angle of the jet becomes smaller than the initial one . in order to analyze the degree of the collimation",
    "more precisely , we define the average jet opening angle as @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the radius of jet head .",
    "the jet opening angle at each radius ( @xmath64 ) is defined as the angle of relativistic components , for which @xmath65 .",
    "note that if we instead employ the criterion @xmath66 , we would obtain the incorrectly small @xmath64 , caused by baryon pollution by numerical diffusion .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] shows the evolution of @xmath67 for each model .",
    "indeed , @xmath67 is always less than @xmath46 , which is a clear evidence of a jet collimation .",
    "we also find that @xmath67 after the breakout is larger than @xmath68 , which is different from the results in the collapsar case @xcite .",
    "this may be attributed to the fact that the ejecta is not stationary contrary to the stellar mantle , and the density gradient of ejecta is steeper than in the case of the stellar mantle .",
    "the initial jet opening angle is also important for the dynamics of jet propagation . in reality",
    ", it would be determined in the vicinity of hmns or bh by the interaction between the jet and the hot accretion disk , or pinching by magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "one of the important consequences of this study is that all models succeed in the breakout by the end of our simulation except for _ m - th45 _ ( @xmath69 ) . for the failed breakout model ( _ m - th45 _ ) , the shocked jet and ejecta can not go sideways into the cocoon because of the large cross section of the jet and eventually expands quasi - spherically",
    "this fact gives an interesting prediction that there may be some population of choked ( failed ) sgrbs or low - luminous new types of event , which could be potential candidates for the high energy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the rate of these events is uncertain , since it depends on the jet luminosity , opening angle , ejecta mass , and the operation timing of the central engine .",
    "we also find that the delayed central engine activity tends to result in failed sgrbs or low - luminous events since the ejecta head has already traveled farther away from the merger remnant ( see @xmath70 of _ m - ti500 _ in table  [ tab : model ] ) .",
    "we here discuss the canonical model for sgrb 130603b based on the results of our simulations . according to @xcite , sgrb 130603b has a well - collimated jet ( its opening angle is @xmath71 ) with a prompt duration @xmath72ms .    here",
    "we focus on the two main properties of the jet : its breakout radius and opening angle .",
    "the breakout radius @xmath73 is defined as the radius where the jet head reaches the edge of the ejecta .",
    "broadly speaking , the spatial length of jet ( @xmath74 ) in sgrb 130603b is @xmath75 cm .",
    "we regard that @xmath76 is a preferred condition for the generation of sgrbs . in this case",
    ", the central engine must be active longer than the jet breakout time @xmath77 , so that the late parts of the jet could reach the emission region without dissipating much energy to the cocoon .",
    "the duration of the central engine can be estimated as @xmath78 , which is @xmath79ms for _ m - ref _ ( see @xcite for a comparison with long grbs ) . by this criterion , _ m - th30 _ , _ m - ti500 _ and _ m - m1 _ are discarded as the candidate for sgrb 130603b .",
    "the second property we focus on is the jet opening angle and its evolution .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the jet undergoes the confinement by the ejecta and breaks out with smaller opening angle than the initial one .",
    "the model _ m - m3 _ does not satisfy observational constraints for sgrb 130603b , because the opening angle that it reaches is too large ( see fig .",
    "therefore , _",
    "m - m3 _ may not be a good model for sgrb 130603b .",
    "note that , since @xmath64 includes the jet component inside the ejecta , it is not exactly equal to the observed opening angle .",
    "we check the average opening angle of the jet outside of ejecta , and it is not very different from @xmath64 .    according to these criteria ,",
    "_ m - ref _ , _ m - l4 _ and _ m - m2 - 2 _ are favored candidates for sgrb 130603b .",
    "note that , if the intrinsic jet luminosity is much larger than @xmath80erg / s , there is a possibility of production of grbs even for @xmath81 ejecta mass .",
    "note also that if the initial jet opening angle is sufficiently small , it may not require the cocoon confinement to explain the observed small jet opening angle .",
    "however , that would become demanding for the central engine , and the mechanism for generating such well - collimated jets has not been discovered yet .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we investigate the jet propagation in the dynamical ejecta after the ns - ns merger .",
    "similar to the collapsar model , the interaction between the jet and the merger ejecta generates the hot cocoon and the jet undergoes collimation at least by the deepest and densest layers of the ejecta , which is qualitatively consistent with the criterion @xmath82 .",
    "importantly , models except for quite large initial opening angle ( @xmath83 ) succeed in the breakout with smaller opening angle than the initial one .",
    "we also , for the first time , show the possibility that there are some populations for the choked sgrbs or low - luminous new types of event .    using only the duration of the prompt emission , the jet opening angle , and ejecta mass , we argue for the canonical model for sgrb 130603b . under the assumption of spherically symmetric ejecta , _ m - m2 - 2 _ model satisfies all observational constraints . in reality , however , the ejecta profile is not exactly spherically symmetric , and its mass contained in the equatorial region tends to be larger .",
    "according to this , the ejecta mass in the realistic system would be larger than in our spherical models by a factor of a few .",
    "therefore , _",
    "m - ref _ and _ m - l4 _ could also be candidates for sgrb 130603b @xcite .",
    "the result of this study and @xcite suggest that the eos of neutron stars may be soft among several models of eos with its maximum mass @xmath84 if the central engine of this sgrb is a ns - ns merger .",
    "the required condition for the central engine is that the jet should be collimated @xmath85 before reaching the ejecta , and its life time should be @xmath79ms with @xmath86erg / s as the average jet power , and the time lag between merger and jet launching should not be much longer than several tens of milli seconds .    as discussed in this _",
    "letter _ , the cocoon confinement changes the conventional picture of jet propagation for the production of sgrbs , and reinforces the scenario of ns - ns binary merger for sgrbs . in bh - ns merger ,",
    "the morphology of dynamical ejecta is non - spherical , i.e , concentrates on the equatorial plane ( see @xcite ) , so the jet never undergoes the strong collimation unless neutrino or magnetic driven winds from the accretion disk provide enough baryons in the polar region .",
