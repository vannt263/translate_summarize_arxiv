    "suppose the prepared multipartite entangled state is intended for use in an entanglement - enabled quantum protocol involving remote clients . while transferring the quantum information to recipients , the state will be modified by inevitable noise processes .",
    "it can happen that the type of multipartite entanglement received by the clients differs significantly from the original one , and the realization of the desired protocol becomes impossible .",

    "degradation of entanglement also imposes limitations on the benefit of advanced quantum metrology relying on genuinely multipartite entangled states @xcite .",
    "these examples demonstrate the necessity of tracking the multipartite entanglement dynamics and finding noise levels corresponding to the change of entanglement type .",
    "previous efforts in this direction relied on specific entanglement measures .",
    "negativity @xcite  a measure detecting negativity of the density matrix under partial transpose ( npt ) @xcite  was originally used by simon _",
    "et al_. @xcite and dr _",
    "et al_. @xcite to analyze ghz , w , and cluster states under local depolarizing noise",
    ". then bandyopadhyay _ et al_. @xcite and hein _",
    "et al_. @xcite utilized it to study the behavior of ghz states and graph states , respectively , under general local homogeneous noise .",
    "generalized ghz - type states under a local amplitude - damping channel were considered with the help of negativity by man _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "et al_. exploited negativity to study effects of local depolarizing , dephasing , and generalized amplitude damping channels on ghz states @xcite and graph states @xcite .",
    "those results were obtained for an arbitrary number of qubits ( except for some graph states @xcite and randomly sampled states @xcite ) due to the ultimate simplicity of negativity computation .",
    "depolarization and dephasing of qudit ghz states were considered via negativity in @xcite .",
    "similarly , concatenated ghz states ( where blocks of a small number of qubits are ghz states themselves ) were considered in @xcite .",
    "however , the negativity does not provide comprehensive information about the entanglement structure because it can be sensitive to the entanglement with respect to a particular bipartition only ( remember , e.g. , bound - entangled ppt states @xcite and biseparable but non - triseparable states @xcite )",
    ".    the absence of full separability can also be detected by some other measures .",
    "for instance , carvalho _",
    "et al_. used the lower bound for a specific generalization of the concurrence and applied it to the dynamics of several - qubit ghz and w states under amplitude - damping and dephasing local channels @xcite .",
    "et al_. used the geometric measure of entanglement @xcite to study global dephasing process of four - qubit ghz , cluster , w , and dicke states @xcite .",

    "et al_. developed the evolution of an averaged sl - invariant entanglement measure for local decoherence @xcite .",
    "a similar approach with a lower bound of the concurrence was exploited in @xcite .",
    "a non - zero value of these quantities indicates the presence of some entanglement within the quantum system , but gives little information about its particular form and , therefore , the benefit of this entanglement for some applications remains questionable .",
    "moreover , vanishing values of the above measures can not guarantee the full separability of the state , and thus , the problem of fundamental noise limits eliminating any form of entanglement ( resulting in fully separable states ) is still open .    genuine multipartite entanglement is the exact opposite of full separability : this form of entanglement is intrinsically multiparticle and can not be attributed to the entanglement distributed among smaller subsystems .",
    "the detection of genuine entanglement for specific quantum states has been a subject of intensive recent research ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "dissipative evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement has been analyzed with the help of some measures .",

    "et al_. used fidelity- and collective spin - based entanglement witnesses to analyze the dynamics of genuine multipartite entanglement of dicke states under local amplitude - damping , phase - damping , and depolarizing channels @xcite .",
    "tripartite negativity and generalized concurrence were also applied to the dissipative dynamics of ghz and w three - qubit entangled states @xcite .",
    "let us recall that the above measures are not precise , i.e. , their zero values do not imply in general that the genuine entanglement is lost .",
    "on the other hand , precise measures ( based on the convex roof definitions ) are quite hard to compute .",
    "this is the main reason why the research in entanglement dynamics is usually restricted to particular initial states ( ghz , w , x , dicke , etc . ) and the use of relatively simple measures .    despite existing results for noises preserving genuine entanglement and entanglement on the whole ( absence of full separability ) ,",
    "the evolution of entanglement structure still remains unexplored .",
    "the aim of this paper is to track the transformations of entanglement structure during dissipative processes . by `` structure '' we understand the number of separate components and the number of particles within each of them ( with allowance for convex mixtures ) @xcite .",
    "this structure resembles a russian nested doll , and dissipative evolution maps states from the outer to the inner dolls .",
    "the evolution of entanglement structure can be seen as a dissociation of the entanglement compound due to interaction with the `` solvent '' ( particles of the environment ) .",
    "note that the `` entanglement compound '' refers to a genuinely entangled multipartite component and differs from the concept of an `` entanglement molecule '' whose bonds depict entanglement of reduced two - particle states @xcite .",
    "the idea of tracking the entanglement structure was realized for three - qubit ghz states under global depolarization in @xcite and for the restricted hilbert space of single - excitation states in @xcite .",
    "we do not restrict ourselves to particular input states and develop a theory of transformations that map _ any _ initial state into a chosen doll . note that mainstream research is focused on showing that a particular state is outside a given doll ( mostly that of biseparable states ) @xcite , whereas ours ensures the opposite and matches the recent approach of ref .",
    "our methodology relies on a neat decomposition of the physical map into simpler ( but not necessary physical ) processes involving entanglement - breaking operations @xcite .",
    "the criteria obtained are formulated for general quantum channels .    to illustrate our approach , we discuss examples of local and global depolarizing noises modelling individual and common baths , respectively .",
    "local depolarizing noises are relevant in quantum communication tasks ( exploiting , e.g. , optical fibers ) as well as in purely physical systems such as nuclear spins in molecules @xcite .",
    "global depolarizing noise is an appropriate model in experiments where full - rank quantum states are detected @xcite and is argued to be the worst - case scenario of system - environment interactions @xcite .",

    "[ section - summary ] , we concisely summarize the ideas , methods , and achieved results .",
    "to express the idea of entanglement structure quantitatively , one can make use of the following formalism .",
    "whenever we speak about entanglement , we imply a particular partition of the composite system . in general , an @xmath1-body system @xmath2 can be partitioned into @xmath3 subsystems , where @xmath3 ranges from @xmath4 to @xmath1 .",
    "if the system is not partitioned at all , we will reckon @xmath5 .",
    "one can divide the @xmath1-body system @xmath2 into @xmath3 subsystems ( also referred to as parties ) in @xmath6 different ways , where @xmath7 is the stirling number of the second kind .",
    "denote by @xmath8 a set of possible partitions into @xmath3 parties .",
    "partitions are ordered in such a way that the parts with fewer bodies go first .",
    "then , for a three - body system @xmath9 we have @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . in the case of a four - body system @xmath13 ,",

    "denote by @xmath29 the @xmath30-th partition of the set @xmath8 , e.g. , @xmath31 . in order to address the @xmath32th subsystem of the partition @xmath29 , we will use the notation @xmath33_m$ ] , e.g. , @xmath34_2 = d$ ] .",
    "quantum states of the system @xmath2 are described by density operators @xmath35 ( positive and with unit trace ) acting on the hilbert space @xmath36 and altogether forming the convex set @xmath37 .",
    "a state @xmath38 is called separable with respect to a particular partition @xmath29 if the resolution @xmath39_1 } \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\varrho_i^{[{{\\cal p}}_j^k]_k}$ ] holds true for some probability distribution @xmath40 and density operators @xmath41_m}$ ] , @xmath42 .",
    "we will denote such a separable state as @xmath43 for brevity . if @xmath44 for any @xmath43 , then @xmath38 is said to be entangled with respect to the partition @xmath29 .",
    "the above consideration of partitions is important because the physics of multipartite entanglement can be quite counterintuitive .",
    "for instance , the three - qubit state of refs .",
    "@xcite is separable with respect to any bipartition @xmath45 but is entangled with respect to tripartition @xmath46 .",
    "another example is a four - qubit smolin state @xcite which is separable with respect to bipartitions @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and is entangled with respect to bipartitions @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , any tripartition @xmath54 , and quartering @xmath55 .",
    "now we can define the concept of @xmath3-separability of a quantum state , which indicates that the state can accommodate components each of which has @xmath3 separate parties .",
    "namely , the state @xmath38 is called @xmath3-separable and denoted @xmath56 if it adopts the resolution @xmath57 for some probability distribution @xmath58 and separable density operators @xmath43 .",
    "note that @xmath56 can still be entangled with respect to partitions @xmath29 if @xmath59 .",
    "clearly , if the state is @xmath3-separable , then it is also @xmath60-separable , which implies the inclusion relation @xmath61 for convex sets of @xmath3-separable states",

    "one can quantify multipartite entanglement in an alternative way by counting the number of bodies that are actually entangled  @xcite .",
    "this number would indicate the resources needed to create the state . for instance , the state @xmath64 of a 5-body system @xmath65 is 2-separable but comprises a party @xmath66 which can be genuinely entangled ( @xmath67=1 $ ] ) , i.e. , requires 3 bodies to be entangled .",
