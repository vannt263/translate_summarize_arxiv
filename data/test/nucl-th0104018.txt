    "elliptic flow , @xmath5 , the differential second moment of the azimuthal momentum distribution , has been the subject of increasing interest @xcite , especially since the discovery@xcite at rhic that @xmath6 gev ) @xmath7 .",
    "this sizable high-@xmath4 collective effect depends strongly on the dynamics in a heavy ion collision and provides important information about the density and effective energy loss of partons .",
    "the simplest theoretical framework to study elliptic flow is ideal hydrodynamics@xcite . for rhic energies ,",
    "ideal hydrodynamics agrees remarkably well with the measured elliptic flow data@xcite up to transverse momenta @xmath8 gev@xmath9 .",
    "however , it fails to saturate at high @xmath10 gev as does the data reported by star at quark matter 2001 .",
    "a theoretical problem with ideal hydrodynamics is that it assumes local equilibrium throughout the whole evolution .",
    "this idealization is marginal for conditions encountered in heavy ion collisions@xcite .",
    "a theoretical framework is required that allows for nonequilibrium dynamics .",
    "covariant boltzmann transport theory provides a convenient framework that depends on the local mean free path @xmath11 .",
    "parton cascade simulations@xcite show on the other hand , that the initial parton density based on hijing@xcite is too low to produce the observed elliptic flow unless the pqcd cross sections are artificially enhanced by a factor @xmath12 .",
    "however , gluon saturation models@xcite predict up to five times higher initial densities , and these may be dense enough to generate the observed collective flow even with pqcd elastic cross sections . in this study",
    ", we explore the dependence of elliptic flow on the initial density and the elastic @xmath13 cross section .",
    "calculations based on inelastic parton energy loss@xcite also predict saturation or decreasing @xmath14 at high @xmath4 .",
    "these calculations are only valid for high @xmath4 , where collective transverse flow from lower-@xmath4 partons can be neglected .",
    "the collective component from low @xmath4 is , on the other hand , automatically incorporated in parton cascades .",
    "though parton cascades lack at present covariant inelastic energy loss , elastic energy loss alone may account for the observed high-@xmath4 azimuthal flow pattern as long as the number of elastic collisions is large enough @xcite .",
    "forerunners of this study @xcite computed elliptic flow for partonic systems starting from initial conditions expected at rhic . here , we extend these in three aspects . we compute the @xmath4-differential elliptic flow @xmath15 , model hadronization , which enables us to compute the final observable hadron flow , and consider realistic nuclear geometry .",
    "we consider here , as in @xcite , the simplest form of lorentz - covariant boltzmann transport theory in which the on - shell phase space density @xmath16 , evolves with an elastic @xmath17 rate .",
    "we solve the transport equation using the cascade method , which inherently violates lorentz covariance . to ensure lorentz covariance",
    ", we apply the parton subdivision technique@xcite .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the elastic gluon scattering matrix elements in dense parton systems are modeled by a debye - screened form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the screening mass , @xmath20 is the total cross section , which we chose to be independent of energy .",
    "the initial condition was a longitudinally boost invariant bjorken tube in local thermal equilibrium at @xmath21 mev at proper time @xmath22",
    "fm/@xmath23 as by fitting the gluon mini - jet transverse momentum spectrum predicted by hijing@xcite ( without shadowing and jet quenching ) .",
    "the pseudo - rapidity distribution was taken as uniform between @xmath24 , while the transverse density distribution was assumed to be proportional to the binary collision distribution for two woods - saxon distributions . for collisions at impact parameter @xmath25 ,",
    "the transverse binary collision profile is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , in terms of the diffuse nuclear density @xmath28 . from hijing ,",
    "the pqcd jet cross section normalization at @xmath29 , @xmath30 is fixed such that @xmath31 .",
    "the evolution was performed numerically with 40 and 100 mb isotropic cross sections , and with 3 , 40 and 100 mb gluonic cross sections ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we used particle subdivision @xmath33 for impact parameters 0 , 2 , and 4 fm , while @xmath34 , 450 , 1100 , and 5000 , for @xmath35 , 8 , 10 , and 12 fm .",
    "two different hadronization schemes were applied .",
    "one is based on local parton - hadron duality , where as @xcite , we assumed that each gluon gets converted to a pion with equal probability for the three isospin states .",
    "hence , @xmath36    the other hadronization prescription was independent fragmentation .",
    "we considered only the @xmath37 channel with the nlo fragmentation function from @xcite .",
    "for the scale factor @xmath38 we take @xmath39 because the initial hijing gluon distribution is already quenched due to initial and final state radiation .",
    "since we do not consider soft physics , we limit our study to hadrons with @xmath40 gev .",
    "[ figure : v2 ] shows elliptic flow as a function of @xmath4 and impact parameter . with increasing @xmath4 , the minimum - bias elliptic flow increases until @xmath44 gev , where it saturates . with increasing impact parameter , elliptic flow first",
    "monotonically increases , then monotonically decreases , showing a maximum at @xmath45 fm .",
    "the minimum - bias flow was computed via @xmath46 where we chose @xmath47 fm .",
    "this differs from the definition by star , which weights @xmath48 with @xmath49 and hence results in a smaller @xmath15 than our estimate .",
    "the @xmath50 mb isotropic curve is almost the same as the @xmath51 mb gluonic curve , showing that not the _ total _ , rather the _ transport _ cross section is the relevant parameter .",
    "thus , we expect that the flow in the @xmath51 mb isotropic case can also reproduced with @xmath52 mb and a gluonic cross section . with the pqcd @xmath13 cross section of 3 mb",
    ", this corresponds to an 80 times larger initial density than from hijing .",
    "[ figure : pt ] shows the quenching of the @xmath4 spectra due to elastic energy loss . in the dilute",
    "@xmath53 mb case quenching is negligible , however , for @xmath54 mb it is an order of magnitude at @xmath55 gev for semicentral collisions . naturally , for a fixed @xmath56 , quenching decreases as the collision becomes more peripheral because the parton density decreases .",
    "hadronization via independent fragmentation results in an additional quenching .",
