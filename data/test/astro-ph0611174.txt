    "extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) are now being discovered at an accelerating pace @xcite . in particular ,",
    "an increasing interest has been focused on hot jupiters that transit their parent stars , since they represent a valuable tool to determine key physical parameters of the egps , such as atmospheric composition and dynamics , thermal properties and presence of condensates @xcite .",
    "the most studied transiting extrasolar planet , hd209458b , orbits a main sequence g - type star at 0.046 au ( period 3.52 days ) .",
    "it is the first one for which repeated transits across the stellar disk were observed ( @xmath0 1.6% absorption ; @xcite ) . along with radial velocity measurements",
    "@xcite , it was possible to determine mass and radius ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , confirming the planet is a gas giant , with one of the lowest densities discovered so far . owing to this property , its very extended atmosphere is one of the best candidates to be probed with transit techniques",
    ". in particular the upper atmosphere extends beyond the roche lobe , showing a population of escaping atoms .",
    "this discovery was possibly due to the observed extraordinary deep absorptions in hi , oi and cii over the stellar emissions lines ( 15% , 13% and 7.5% respectively ; @xcite ) . the numerous follow - up",
    "observations of hd209458b , also include the detection and upper limits of absorption features in the deeper atmosphere @xcite .",
    "most recently @xcite detected the thermal emission of this planet with the spitzer space telescope during a secondary transit in the 24 @xmath3 m band and @xcite detected the first primary eclipse in the same band .",
    "to explain these observations several models were proposed , including atmospheric photochemistry , thermal properties , 3-d circulation simulations , cloud and condensate height , escaping processes ( e.g. @xcite ) . for these reasons ,",
    "the extrasolar planet hd209458b is the best known so far .",
    "additional observations are required , though , to constrain the past , present and future modeling effort .",
    "the planet hd189733b , recently discovered by @xcite , with mass @xmath4 and @xmath5 , orbits an early main sequence k star at 0.0313 au .",
    "it is an exoplanet transiting the brightest and closest star discovered so far .",
    "here we focus our interest on both planets hd209458b and hd189733b , and we model the spectral absorption features in the mid - infrared ( mir ) due to the most abundant atmospheric molecules during their _ primary eclipse _ ,",
    "i.e. , when the planet passes in front of the parent star",
    ". the use of transmission spectroscopy to probe the upper layers of the transiting egps , has been particularly successful in the uv and visible spectral ranges @xcite , and only very recently attempted in the mir , in the 24 @xmath3 m band , using spitzer observations @xcite .",
    "two circumstances make it an approach worth considering .",
    "first , the high surface temperatures , relatively small masses , and mostly hydrogen atmospheres of close - in egps imply large atmospheric scale heights . as a consequence , for spectral features that span a reasonably wide bandwidth , so",
    "that the total photon flux is not too small , this is a feasible and diagnostically powerful technique .",
    "second , this is a complementary approach to the secondary eclipse observations .",
    "transmission spectroscopy , taken during primary eclipse , is sensitive to different parameters and regions of the atmosphere , compared to emission spectroscopy , on which the secondary eclipse method is based .",

    "the requirement is certainly met for the known transiting egps .",
    "carbon monoxide ( co ) and methane ( ch@xmath8 ) , and other photochemical products , such as carbon dioxide ( co@xmath9 ) and acetylene ( c@xmath9h@xmath9 ) , are plausibly present in the atmospheres of egps , and possibly abundant to be detected .",
    "these species have strong absorption bands in the mir , and more importantly , in spectral regions compatible with present and future space - based observations such as the spitzer space telescope or the james webb space telescope @xcite .",
    "given o and c , h@xmath9o and co will be controlled mainly by the relative abundances of these two species .    *",
    "if c / o ratio is close to the solar , h@xmath9o , co and ch@xmath8 abundances are determined by the thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry in the deep atmosphere @xcite . *",
    "if c / o ratio is above solar , the atmospheric chemistry might change dramatically and , according to the scenario proposed by @xcite , planets should show a significant paucity of water vapor in their atmospheres , carbon rich species should by contrast be enhanced .",
    "in particular , co is expected to be the dominant carbon - bearing molecule at high temperatures and ch@xmath10 the dominant at low temperatures @xcite . *",
    "if c / o ratio is below solar , the atmosphere is depopulated of carbon - bearing molecules and water - vapor is the dominant species between @xmath11 to 1.5 bars .",
    "we have built a model of planetary atmosphere and calculated the expected absorption of the stellar light when filtered through the planetary atmospheric layers .",
    "this has been already discussed in the literature . in particular for our simulations , we have used the geometry and the equations described in @xcite ( fig .",
    "1 , configuration 2 ) and @xcite ( sec .",
    "2.1 , fig .",
    "our cloud and haze - free atmospheres were divided in forty layers spanning from @xmath11 to 1 bars .",
    "photochemical models are used to determine the molecular abundances of 33 species above @xmath01 bar altitude level .",
    "we start with four parent molecules h@xmath7 , co , h@xmath7o , and ch@xmath10 .",
    "their relative abundances are determined by thermochemistry in the deep atmosphere , and are fixed as our lower boundary condition .",
    "chemical reactions and eddy mixing profiles are taken from @xcite .",
    "details of the model can be referred to @xcite and references contained therein . for the simulation of the photochemistry of hd209458b",
    ", we adopt the solar spectrum .",
    "for hd189733b we use the spectrum of hd22049 , which is a k2v star similar to hd189733 @xcite .",
    "we have repeated our calculations for three temperature - pressure profiles ( fig .",
    "[ model ] right ) , to test the sensitivity of our results to these assumptions .",
    "the modeled chemical abundances show a negligible dependence on temperature ( see @xcite )    the absorption coefficients in the mir were estimated using a line - by - line model , lblabc @xcite , that generates monochromatic gas absorption coefficients from molecular line lists -hitemp , @xcite- , for each of the gases present in the atmosphere .",

    "ch@xmath8 and c@xmath9h@xmath9 are more abundant in the upper atmosphere compared to hd209458b , since hd189733 is a later type star , therefore the photo - dissociation processes occurring in the atmosphere of that planet are less significant .    _",
    "sensitivity to molecular abundances and c / o ratio .",
    "[ ratio ] show the predicted absorption signatures due to water vapor and co on the planets hd189733b and hd209458b .",
    "the three plots compare the spectral absorptions of these two species when c / o ratio is solar ( standard case , solid line , see fig .",
    "[ model ] left for mixing ratios ) and when is below and above solar . as specific examples ,",
    "we have assumed h@xmath7o to be 10 times more and at the same time co 10 times less abundant than the standard case ( dotted line ) , and vice - versa ( dashed line ) . when we increase / diminish h@xmath7o and co of a factor 10 , the absorption is increased / decreased by a constant @xmath0 0.03  % through all the selected wavelength range .    in these figures , we show also the signatures ( white rhombi , squares and triangles ) relative to the three cases ( standard , c / o ratio below and above solar ) averaged over the irac , irs and mips bandpasses ( centered at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8 , 16 and 24 @xmath3 m ) , the instruments on board the spitzer space telescope ( see table 1 for the calculated absorptions ) .",
    "water vapor has strong absorption lines through all the selected spectral range in the mir , the co signature appears only in a narrower wavelength interval , where the irac 4.5 @xmath3 m bandpass is centered .",
    "when the c / o ratio is above solar , the triangle is expected to appear above the rhombus in that band , indicating the strong co contribution to the total absorption ( table 1 , numbers in bold ) .",
    "note that we included the species ch@xmath8 , co@xmath9 and c@xmath9h@xmath9 in our calculations , which strongly absorb in the mir .",
    "however their abundances are too small compared to co and h@xmath7o , and they are masked by these species .",
    "for example , we show in fig .",
    "[ co2 ] ( left ) the contribution due to co@xmath7 in the case of c / o above solar ratio .",
    "co@xmath7 is increased by a factor 10 here , to follow co behavior consistently with chemistry predictions @xcite .",
    "when co@xmath7 is present , an increase in absorption of @xmath0 0.02  % is found in the band centered on 15 @xmath3 m and a very narrow peak reaching 0.07  % is visible at shorter wavelengths .",
    "although not negligible , the contribution due to co@xmath7 is masked by co and water .",
    "_ sensitivity to temperature .",
    "_ the effects due to temperature variations ( fig .",
    "[ co2 ] right ) are negligible compared to the changes in molecular mixing ratios . temperature plays a secondary role in the determination of the optical depth : it affects the absorption coefficients and the atmospheric scale heights ( see eq . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "for hd189733b , the discrepancy between the standard and the hot profile is less than 0.005% , and between the standard and the very hot profile has a maximum of 0.014% in the 15 - 30 @xmath3 m range ( fig .",
    "[ co2 ] right ) .",
    "analogous results are obtained for hd209458b .",
    "in our model we did not include the contribution of hazes or clouds @xcite . due to their presence ,",
    "the atmospheric optical depth might increase , partially masking the absorption features due to atmospheric molecules . in the case of water vapor and co ,",
    "only clouds / hazes lying at altitudes higher than 1 bar might affect our results .",
    "predictions of cloud / haze is particularly difficult for egps , since the few observations we have are not sufficient to constrain all the cloud microphysics and aerosol parameters .",
    "moreover , the planetary limb observable during the star occultation might show the signatures of both the night and day side of those planets , which are presumably tidally locked @xcite .",
    "the thermal profiles , hence the condensate dynamics , might be very different on the two sides .",
    "consequently , a more complete model able to predict cloud and haze location and optical characteristics , should contain a 3-d dynamical simulation of the atmosphere . in this paper",
    "we limit our simulations to the cloud - haze free atmosphere , with the caveat they might be perturbed by the possible presence ( constant or variable ) of optically thick particles in the atmosphere above 1 bar pressure .",
    "same considerations are valid for the thermal profiles .",
    "a extensive literature is available on @xmath12 profiles for egps at pressures from @xmath01 bar to 10@xmath13 - 10@xmath14 bars , most recently including 3d dynamical effects @xcite . for transmission spectroscopy in the mir , we need to consider also the contribution of the upper atmosphere .",
    "the @xmath12 profiles calculated by @xcite suggest that the trend for the atmospheric temperature is to increase in the exosphere . for our simulations",
    ", we use a @xmath12 profile compatible with the lower atmosphere models cited above up to 10@xmath15 - 10@xmath13 bars , and then we consider three cases : the atmospheric temperature decreases up to 10@xmath16 bars ( standard ) , the atmosphere is isothermal ( hot , very hot profiles ) . our results , show that the differences among the spectra calculated with the three profiles are within 0.009  % for @xmath17 m and within 0.014  % at longer wavelengths , so we are confident our simulations will not significantly change using a more refined thermal structure .",
    "our model atmospheres extend to 10@xmath16 bars , where non local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) effects might occur @xcite .",
    "however , if we truncate our calculations to 10@xmath18 bars , we obtain a maximum error of @xmath19 at 30 @xmath3 m ( no discrepancy for wavelengths shorter than 20 @xmath3 m ) , indicating that our calculated absorptions in lte regime are correct at first order approximation .    in order to detect the presence of water vapor and co on hd189733b and hd209458b in the mir , an extra absorption of @xmath0 0.15  %",
    "is expected to be added to the 2.85  % and 1.6  % due to the optically thick disks at 1 bar atmospheric level . to estimate the chemical abundances , an accuracy of at least 0.03  %",
    "is needed . by inspection of the relative absorption of the irac 4.5 @xmath3 m bandpass with respect to the others",
    ", we might be able to infer the c / o ratio , but in this case an extremely high s / n is required .",
    "hd189733 is a bright k0v star of magnitude k = 5.5 .",
    "we estimate the brightness in the four irac bands to be of the order of 1850 , 1100 , 730 and 400 mjy at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8 @xmath3 m respectively . for hd209458 , a g0v star with k - magnitude of 6.3 , the irac predicted fluxes are 878 , 556 , 351 and 189 mjy . according to these numbers , a better s /",
    "n should be obtainable for hd189733b @xcite , and this makes hd189733b a better candidate for observations .",
    "in this paper we have presented simulations of transmission spectra of two extrasolar giant planets during their transit in front of their parent star . according to our calculations",
    ", we estimate an excess absorption in the ir of up to 0.15 % for hd189733b and up to 0.12 % for hd209458b ( c / o ratio @xmath0 solar ) , in addition to the nominal 2.85 % and 1.6 % absorptions measured at shorter wavelengths . if water were far less abundant , other species might be observable , depending on their mixing ratios . among them , co@xmath9 , ch@xmath8 and c@xmath9h@xmath9 are the best candidates .    according to our simulations ,",
    "transmission spectra of egps in the mir are sensitive to molecular abundances and less to temperature variations .",
    "temperature influences the transmission spectrum by way of its influence on the atmospheric scale height , as discussed by brown ( 2001 ) , and on the absorption coefficients .",
    "if water vapor and co are as abundant as photochemical models predict , we expect they can be detected with the irac , irs and mips instruments on board the spitzer telescope and with future telescopes like jwst .",
    "moreover , if an accuracy of 0.03  % is obtainable , future observations may give a first direct estimate of h@xmath9o and co abundances in the upper atmosphere of egps and possibly -depending on their mixing ratios- a constraint on co@xmath9 , ch@xmath8 and c@xmath9h@xmath9 .",
