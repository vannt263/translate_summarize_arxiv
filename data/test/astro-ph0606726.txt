    "there are nearly 200 known extrasolar planetary systems . many of these systems contain planets of several jupiter masses . for those few systems that transit the stellar disk , the radius",
    "can be measured , and most of these transiting planets appear to be gas giants ( see , e.g. henry et al . 2000 ; udalski et al .",
    "2002 ; pont et al . 2004 ; alonso et al .",
    "2004 ) . currently , there are two main theories for forming such planets . the core accretion theory ( pollack et al .",
    "1996 ) argues that a heavy element core is built up by the accretion of planetesimals . as the core grows , its ability to accrete gas from the surrounding disk increases .",
    "when the core is sufficiently massive , there is a rapid accretion of such gas and a giant planet is formed .",
    "the big advantage of this model is that the same basic mechanism of planetesimal accretion will form terrestrial planets , uranus and neptune - sized intermediate planets , and giant planets .",
    "the disadvantages are that the core mass required to form jupiter is at the upper end of the mass estimated from interior models ( saumon and guillot 2004 ) , and that the time to reach a jupiter mass is uncomfortably close to the upper limit estimated for lifetime of the gas disk ( haisch , lada , & lada 2001 ) .",
    "both these objections can be ameliorated , if not entirely removed , if the accreted material does not sink entirely to the core ( pollack et al .",
    "1996 ) and if the opacities are in fact lower than those estimated from interstellar grains ( podolak 2003 ; hubickyj et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "a competing mechanism for giant planet formation is a local disk instability ( boss 1998a ) .",
    "this model suggests that under the right conditions an instability can form in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "this instability can lead to the creation of a self - gravitating clump of gas and dust .",
    "such clumps can contract to form giant gaseous protoplanets ( boss 1997 ; boss 1998b ) .",
    "this model has several advantages , among them , that planets can be formed quickly , before the nebular gas dissipates .",
    "calculations by boss ( 2000 ) show that the unstable disk can break up into giant gaseous protoplanets in @xmath1 yrs .",
    "the instability occurs over dynamical timescales ( some tens of orbital periods ) , and the formation of clumps ( future giant gaseous protoplanets ) can easily occur within the estimated lifetime of most circumstellar disks ( haisch , lada , & lada 2001 )",
    ".    one of the problems with the disk instability model is that the planets formed by this mechanism start with a solar abundance of elements .",
    "observations as well as theoretical models , however , indicate that jupiter s envelope ( and saturn s as well ) is enriched with heavy elements ( young 2003 ; saumon et al .",
    "the theoretical estimate for the mass of heavy elements in jupiter is @xmath2 ( saumon and guillot 2004 ) . a solar composition planet of jupiter s mass",
    "would be expected to have only @xmath3 of heavy elements .",
    "this means that planets created by the disk instability mechanism must have accreted this additional material later , presumably as solids . in this paper",
    "we follow the evolution of an isolated clump and compute the planetesimal accretion rate as a function of time .",
    "the calculation is divided into three parts : the computation of the evolution of an isolated clump , the computation of the cross section for the two body interaction between the protoplanet and a planetesimal , and the actual calculation of the mass that is accreted .",
    "the details are presented in the following sections .",
    "in our calculation we assume an isolated non - rotating clump .",
    "the initial physical parameters of the body were chosen to fit the expected initial conditions after the onset of the gravitational instability ( boss 2002 ) .",
    "we assume that there are no external influences on the body , such as solar heating or disk shear .",
    "we follow the evolution of this clump using a stellar evolution code developed by one of us ( kovetz ) .",
    "this code , which was originally developed for stellar evolution studies , solves the standard equations of stellar evolution : @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number fraction of the @xmath10th species , related to the mass fraction @xmath11 by @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the particle flux of the @xmath10th species , determined by the corresponding coefficient of diffusion @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the temperature ` gradient ' @xmath16 , determined by the mixing length recipe ( mlr ) , and the remaining symbols are in standard notation . at the center @xmath17 ,",
    "the energy flux @xmath18 and the @xmath13 s all vanish .",
    "the star s surface is taken to be the photosphere .",
    "thus , the surface boundary conditions are @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the optical depth of the photosphere , which we take to be unity .",
    "the foregoing equations are replaced by implicit difference equations , which are then solved numerically . instead of using a fixed grid of mass points ,",
    "the code determines the mass distribution by requiring the function @xmath23 to change by a constant increment between any two consecutive mass points . with",
    "@xmath24 a numerical constant of order unity , the second - order difference equation @xmath25 , which has the boundary conditions @xmath26 at the center and @xmath27 at the surface , ensures equal steps of @xmath28 , except near the center , where it imposes equal steps of @xmath29 .    in the absence of any nuclear ( or chemical )",
    "change , the rates @xmath30 will all vanish , but the heating source @xmath31 may still be positive , e.g. when ( and where ) accreted planetesimals are slowed by friction .    as noted above , convection is treated in accordance with mlr . in order to avoid the difficulties connected with sudden , instantaneous mixing in convective zones , the code regards convective mixing as a diffusive process in a gas of density @xmath32 , mean velocity @xmath33 ( supplied by mlr ) and mean free path @xmath34 .",
    "the artificial convective diffusion coefficient @xmath35 ( the same for all species ) of course vanishes outside the convective zones . any real diffusion , or settling , process",
    "can then be easily incorporated by adding actual diffusion coefficients .",
    "the equation of state tables were kindly provided by d. saumon and are based on saumon et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , supplemented at low pressures by our own equation of state , appropriate for a weakly interacting ( debye approximation ) mixture of gases .",
    "the opacity tables were kindly provided by p. bodenheimer , based on the work of pollack et al .",
    "they include both gas and grain opacity , the latter being based on the size distribution relevant for interstellar grains .",
    "we were able to find an initial quasi - static model of a jupiter mass object , similar to the initial clump in the model of boss ( 2002 ) , based on a preliminary model , also provided by bodenheimer .",
    "table 1 gives the initial parameters of the starting model .",
    "the pressure and temperature profiles for the initial model are shown in fig .",

    "we present an evolutionary model of an isolated giant gaseous protoplanet such as might be formed from a clump caused by an instability in the solar nebula .",
    "assuming that such a clump survives and becomes a protoplanet , we calculate the rate at which it would capture planetesimals .",
    "we considered three planetesimal sizes and two types of materials , ice + rock , and pure rock .",
    "the total mass of solids that is captured depends on the size distribution of bodies in the accretion zone and on their composition .",
    "100 km - sized planetesimals can not be captured during the first @xmath36 years of the evolution .",
    "this is due to the fact that until that time the density and temperature throughout most of the volume of the protoplanet are too low .",
    "bodies with sizes of 1 km or less can be accreted starting at times shortly after the clump s creation .",
    "icy bodies are captured more easily than pure rock planetesimals .    in the case of higher random velocities , the capture efficiency decreases and the time for capturing the same amount of solids is longer , but even with random velocities as high as 15% of the keplerian velocity , more than 16 @xmath37 of heavy elements can be captured . for a higher surface density ( bigger amount of solids in jupiter s feeding zone ) , the total mass of heavy elements that is captured increases proportionately . as can be seen from table 3 the accreted mass varies by a factor of two when the random velocity of the 100 km planetsimals is increased from 1 to 2 km s@xmath38 .",
    "since the latter is already 20% of jupiter s orbital speed , it is unlikely that the random velocities will be significantly higher than this , especially since most of the planetesimals are captured before they can be highly stirred . even in this case",
    "some 50% of the mass in the feeding zone is captured .",
    "if , as is likely , there is a distribution of planetesimal sizes , with 100 km being at the high end , then the fraction of feeding zone mass that is captured will be even higher .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. weissman 1986 ) that planetesimals are actually loosely bound `` rubble piles '' .",
    "if this is indeed the case , they would be held together even more weakly than our ice + rock planetesimals .",
    "such planetesimals would be captured more easily that those composed of ice + rock , and again , the values we have presented for the mass captured would be a lower limit .",
    "of course all this assumes that the planetesimals remain in the feeding zone of the protoplanet and are not scattered out ( see , e.g. , hahn and malhotra 1999 ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that simulations of planetesimal scattering treat the planets as point masses , and do not include the gas drag on the planetesimal as it goes through the protoplanet s extended envelope .",
    "the energy loss which results from the gas drag will act to inhibit scattering .",
    "in addition , the larger cross section for capture that an extended protoplanet presents , will also significantly increase the ratio of captured to ejected planetesimals . thus , in the simulations of hahn and malhotra , for example , significant mass ejection requires times much longer than the @xmath39 years required for the protojupiter to accrete most of the mass in its feeding zone .",
    "therefore , if giant planets are created by the disk instability mechanism , there is a good chance that many of the planetsimals will be accreted before they are scattered out of the feeding zone . as a consequence",
    ", these protoplanets can collect a substantial amount of solids during their evolution and end up with a significantly non - solar composition .",
    "this finding removes an important objection to the disk instability model as a mechanism for giant planet formation .",
    "our model assumes a non - rotating clump , in reality , the clump is likely to have some angular momentum .",
    "this might act to slow the contraction of the clump in its later stages , and lead to the formation of a subdisk .",
    "planetesimals in this subdisk could then provide the material for forming both regular and irregular satellites .",
    "it is also interesting to speculate on the possibility of observational verification of our results .",
    "some models of extrasolar planets whose densities are known seem to indicate non - solar compositions ( e.g. , bodenheimer et al .",
    "the extent of the enhacement of the non - solar component may provide limits on the proposed accretion mechanism .",
    "however , both the fits to the observations and the models we have computed , have , as yet , too many free parameters , to allow useful constraints .",
    "there are a number of issues which may affect the conclusions presented above . in the first place",
    ", the captured planetesimals will contribute high - z material to the gaseous envelope , and change its composition .",
    "this will also affect the opacity of the envelope .",
    "since much of this additional material will end up in the convective region of the planet , this change in opacity should not have a large effect on its subsequent evolution .",
    "in addition , there will be some small effect due to the additional mass of the planetesimals themselves .",
    "finally , the high - z material which remains in the envelope in the form of grains will sediment towards the center of the protoplanet leading to the formation of a core , and this too should affect the final evolution of the body .",
    "we hope to address these issues in more detail in future work .",
