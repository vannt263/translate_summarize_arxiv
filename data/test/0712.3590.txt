    "the zitterbewegung ( zb , trembling motion ) , first described by schrodinger with the use of the dirac equation for free relativistic electrons in a vacuum @xcite , has been in recent years a subject of great theoretical interest since it has been shown that this phenomenon should exist in many systems in solids @xcite . if one deals with two or more interacting energy branches , an interference of the upper and lower energy states gives rise to the zb also in the absence of external fields .",
    "a formal similarity between two bands interacting via the @xmath4 terms in a solid and the dirac equation for relativistic electrons in a vacuum allows one to apply similar theoretical methods for both systems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "most of the theoretical zb treatments for semiconductors used as a starting point plane electron waves . however , lock @xcite in his important paper observed that , since such a wave is not localized , it seems of a limited practicality to speak of rapid oscillations on the average position of a wave of infinite extent . using the dirac equation lock demonstrated that , when an electron is represented by a wave packet , the zb oscillations do not sustain their amplitude but become transient .",
    "the disappearance of oscillations at large times is guaranteed by the riemann - lebesgues theorem as long as the wave packet is a smoothly varying spatial function .",
    "the transient character of the trembling motion was demonstrated in our recent papers @xcite .",
    "since the zb is by its nature not a stationary state but a dynamical phenomenon , it is natural to study it with the use of wave packets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these have become of practical use with the emergence of the femto - second pulse technology @xcite .",
    "recently , the transient trembling motion was proposed for ultra cold atoms @xcite , for photons in two - dimensional photonic crystals @xcite and for ramsey interferometry @xcite .",
    "most recently , an actual _ observation _ of an acoustic analogue of zb in a macroscopic two - dimensional sonic crystal was reported @xcite .",
    "the trembling motion of charge carriers in solids has been described until present for no external potentials . on the other hand ,",
    "lock has remarked that , when an electron spectrum is discrete , the zb oscillations do not have to disappear with time . in the present work we consider the trembling motion of electrons in solids in the presence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is known to cause no interband electron transitions , so the essential features of zb , which results from an interference of positive and negative energy states of the system , are expected not to be destroyed . on the other hand , introduction of an external field provides an important parameter affecting the zb behavior .",
    "we show that , indeed , the zb in a magnetic field is not damped in time .",
    "we consider the zb phenomenon in monolayer graphene .",
    "this material has recently become an important subject of investigation in the condensed matter physics and its applications @xcite . in particular , the charge carriers in graphene are considered to represent massless dirac fermions . in our approach",
    "we look for observable zb phenomena .",
    "the situation we describe seems to be the most promising case for an experimental observation of the trembling motion in solids considered until present .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we consider the hamiltonian for electrons in graphene in a magnetic field , its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "second , we calculate carrier velocities and their averages taken over a gaussian wave packet .",
    "third , we give results for the zb of electric current and electron position and emphasize the essential features introduced by the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "finally , we propose and describe electromagnetic radiation emitted by the trembling electrons .",
    "the paper is concluded by a summary . in appendices we discuss additional points related to the subject .",
    "we consider a graphene monolayer in an external magnetic field parallel to the @xmath5 axis . as shown in both continuum and tight - binding models ,",
    "there exist two inequivalent points @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the brillouin zone ( bz ) of graphene .",
    "the hamiltonian for electrons and holes at the @xmath6 point is @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath910@xmath10 cm / s is a characteristic velocity , @xmath11 is the generalized momentum , @xmath12 is the vector potential and @xmath13 is the electron charge .",

    "for nonzero values of @xmath105 , both @xmath125 and @xmath126 appear .",
    "it is seen that the frequency and the shape of zb oscillations change with growing @xmath105 values . for growing @xmath105 different @xmath97",
    "become large and in consequence different frequencies @xmath78 and @xmath79 dominate in sums ( [ v_vy(t ) ] ) and ( [ v_vx(t ) ] ) . the striking feature seen in figs .",
    "2a , 2b and 2c is , that the zb is manifested by several frequencies simultaneously .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that , as follows from eq .",
    "( [ h_ens ] ) , in graphene the energy distances between the landau levels diminish with @xmath36 , which results in different values of frequencies @xmath78 and @xmath79 for different @xmath36 .",
    "thus , it is the presence of an external quantizing magnetic field that introduces various frequencies into zb .    for sufficiently large values of @xmath105 only _",
    "one _ frequency prevails , as shown in fig .",
    "this is related to the fact that , as seen in the inset of fig . 8 in appendix b , the coefficients @xmath97 in this regime",
    "have a pronounced maximum around a specific value @xmath127 .",
    "the dominant frequency is @xmath128 , which is simply the cyclotron frequency for @xmath127 , see fig .",
    "thus , it might appear that the current shown in fig .",
    "2d corresponds to the simple classical cyclotron motion and the trembling motion is manifested only by the damping in time ( see appendix d ) .",
    "this is however not the case .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the calculated current for @xmath110@xmath108 ( the same as in fig .",
    "2d ) , but in a much larger time scale .",
    "it turns out that , after the zb oscillations seemingly die out , they actually reappear .",
    "thus , _ for all @xmath105 values ( including @xmath106 ) , the zb oscillations have a permanent character _",
    ", that is they do not disappear in time .",
    "this feature is due to the discrete character of the electron spectrum caused by a magnetic field .",
    "the above property is in sharp contrast to the no - field cases considered until present , in which the spectrum is not quantized and the zb of a wave packet has a transient character , see @xcite . in mathematical terms , due to the discrete character of the spectrum , averages of operator quantities taken over a wave packet are sums and not integrals , see eqs .",
    "( [ v_vy(t ) ] ) and ( [ v_vx(t ) ] ) .",
    "the sums do not obey the riemann - lebesgues theorem for integrals which guaranteed the damping of zb in time for a continuous spectrum ( see ref .",
    "we consider the demonstration of a permanent character of zb oscillations for a discrete spectrum to be the main result of our present work .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the zb oscillations of the current for a constant wave vector @xmath109@xmath108 at different magnetic fields . it can be seen that the intensity of a magnetic field has a dramatic effect on zb : not only its frequency is changed but also the character of oscillations .",
    "lower magnetic fields are equivalent to higher @xmath105 values , since both lead to higher landau levels involved ( see figs .",
    "2d and 4a ) .",
    "inversely , higher magnetic fields and lower @xmath105 values lead to lower landau levels involved ( see figs .",
    "2b and 4c ) .",
    "at very small magnetic fields there exist three regimes of zb oscillations : the initial oscillations dying out during a few femtoseconds ( as shown in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the second range of oscillations dying out during several picoseconds , as shown in fig . 2d , and the third range of permanent , somewhat irregular oscillations shown for @xmath129ps in fig .",
    "finally , we calculate the displacements @xmath130 and @xmath131 of the wave packet . to this end",
    "we integrate expressions ( [ v_vy(t ) ] ) and ( [ v_vx(t ) ] ) with respect to time using the initial conditions @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the results are plotted in fig . 5 in the form of @xmath134 trajectories for different initial wave vectors @xmath105 .",
    "the direction of movement is clockwise .",
    "the trajectories span early times ( 1ps ) after the creation of a wave packet . as mentioned above",
    ", the zb oscillations do not die out in time which is reflected by infinite trajectories . in fig .",
    "5 the trajectories are shown around the point @xmath135 , whereas in reality the @xmath136 component of the center is almost a linear function of @xmath137 .",
    "all in all , the presence of a quantizing magnetic field has the following important effects on the trembling motion .",
    "( 1 ) for @xmath2 the zb oscillation are permanent , while for @xmath3 they are transient .",
    "( 2 ) for @xmath2 many zb frequencies appear , whereas for @xmath3 only one zb frequency exists .",
    "( 3 ) for @xmath2 both interband and intraband ( cyclotron ) frequencies appear in zb ; for @xmath3 there are no intraband frequencies .",
    "( 4 ) magnetic field intensity changes not only the zb frequencies but the entire character of zb spectrum .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "2 were obtained using the simplifying assumption about packet s width : @xmath138 .",
    "this allowed us to use formula ( [ gauss_u_mn_ldy ] ) for the calculation of @xmath97 .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "4 we show the results obtained for constant @xmath139 and variable @xmath1 , for which we had to use general formula ( [ gauss_u_mn ] ) .",
    "in all the calculations involving magnetic field , precise numerical values of the hermite polynomials are required , see eqs .",
    "( [ gauss_u_mn ] ) and ( [ gauss_u_mn_ldy ] ) . for the results shown above we used the values of the first 400 hermite polynomials , and checked their high precision using sum rule ( [ gauss_a1 ] ) .",
    "we also considered the case of an initial electron momentum directed not along the @xmath20 direction ( as shown above ) , but also along the @xmath136 direction . in this case",
    "the @xmath97 coefficients are imaginary , so that only the last two terms of eqs .",
    "( [ v_vy(t ) ] ) and ( [ v_vx(t ) ] ) come into play .",
    "the final results are similar but not identical to those quoted above .",
    "the reason is that , as already mentioned , the initial hamiltonian ( [ h_pi0 ] ) is not symmetric in @xmath14 and @xmath15 momenta . when using gaussian wave packet ( [ gauss_f ] )",
    ", we assumed equal upper and lower components @xmath116 .",
    "this is in contrast to previous papers which usually took @xmath140 , @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "this choice is somewhat arbitrary , it is determined by an experimental wave packet usually prepared by optical methods .",
    "one should keep in mind that the relative final amplitudes of @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( and the resulting currents ) depend on this choice via @xmath97 coefficients , see eqs .",
    "( [ gauss_u_mn ] ) and ( [ gauss_u_mn_ldy ] ) .",
    "if one chooses @xmath140 , @xmath141 , the resulting motion coming from the @xmath6 point of bz is only along the @xmath136 direction .",
    "it is of interest that phenomena analogous to those described above for electrons , occur also for photons .",

    "thus they correspond approximately to a situation with the fermi energy relatively low in the valence band .",
    "clearly , the frequencies corresponding to transitions with the final states below the fermi energy are not possible .    in general terms , the excitation of the system we propose is due to the nonzero momentum @xmath163 given to the electron .",
    "it can be provided by accelerating the electron in the band by or by exciting the electron with a nonzero momentum by light from the valence band to the conduction band .",
