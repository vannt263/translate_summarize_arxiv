    "the laser ultrasonics technique is a unique tool for acoustic - wave generation in objects with a curved surface .",
    "much work has been done by this means for generating surface and bulk acoustic waves in opaque cylindrical targets with a view of their non - destructive testing and evaluation , see recent publications @xcite and the bibliography therein .",
    "there exists a well developed theory for the case when , at a given laser wavelength , the target ( either cylindrical or planar ) is opaque and hence the source is located at the surface .",
    "given so , the ablation model applies for high enough local energy such that causes ablation at the laser - heated region of the surface , and the dipole ( scruby s ) model applies for relatively low incoming energy scruby:1990 . in this latter , thermoelastic regime ,",
    "the dilatation of an infinitely small volume adjacent to the surface produces a surface source equivalent to a force dipole .",
    "the dipole strength has been derived in royer:2001,arias:2003 .",
    "thermoelastic regime for the optically absorptive materials implies that the laser input penetrates into a target and creates a volume distribution of sources therein .",
    "hence the assumption of a surface source is no longer appropriate .",
    "laser generation of acoustic waves in optically absorptive materials has been considered for the case of a planar target ( plate ) @xcite .",
    "the next natural step is extending laser ultrasonics treatment to optically absorptive cylindrical targets . to the best of the authors knowledge ,",
    "such a case has not yet been studied .",
    "the present paper proposes a two - dimensional ( 2d ) semi - analytical model for calculating acoustic response to a line - focused laser pulse in an optically absorptive isotropic cylinder .",
    "thermoelastic regime of generation is assumed and a typical case of materials with negligible thermal conductivity is treated .",
    "closed - form solution is obtained in the fourier domain to the inhomogeneous ordinary differential system with a radially distributed thermoelastic source and with the traction - free boundary condition at the cylinder surface . performing two",
    "inverse fourier transforms yields the sought waveforms of acoustic response in the time - space domain .",
    "this calculation is carried out in the paper for two different source settings .",
    "one of them formally treats the case of an opaque cylinder by assuming a vanishingly small optical penetration or , which is equivalent , a buried source tending to the cylinder surface .",
    "the other considers the actual case of an optically absorptive cylinder , where the exponentially decaying law of optical absorption produces a distributed source with large enough radial penetration length .",
    "the results obtained for these two settings are compared with the calculation based on scruby s model of a surface dipole source .",
    "it is observed that the waveforms , computed for a buried source tending to the surface , agree very well with those following for scruby s surface - source model , whereas the waveforms , computed for a distributed source , have essentially different shapes comparatively to the prediction following for the surface source .",
    "the former observation serves as a test for our model , while the latter highlights the effect of laser - energy penetration into the bulk of an optically absorptive cylinder .",
    "consider an infinite homogenous isotropic elastic cylinder of radius @xmath0 , whose surface is heated by the line - focused laser pulse independent of the axial coordinate @xmath1 .",
    "the laser energy is supposed to be low enough to preclude ablation .",
    "it is assumed that viscoelasticity , thermal conduction and the contribution of deformation to the entropy change may be disregarded .",
    "the thermoelastic generation of acoustic wave is therefore described by the following simplified system of governing equations:@xmath2where @xmath3 is the stress tensor including mechanical and thermal stresses , @xmath4 is the strain tensor , @xmath5 is the displacement , @xmath6 is the density , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the lam coefficients , @xmath9 is the thermal modulus ( @xmath10 is the dilatation coefficient ) , @xmath11 is the temperature rise , @xmath12 is the specific heat , @xmath13 is the power density of the line laser source , @xmath14 is the identity matrix and @xmath15 denotes the trace .",
    "the heat input @xmath16 creates a volume distribution of thermal sources inside the cylinder through the optical absorption . assuming normal incidence of the gaussian laser beam @xcite and the exponential fall off of the incoming energy @xmath17",
    ", it follows that @xmath18where @xmath19describes the angular extent of the beam with width @xmath20 . by ( eq::coupled_thermoelastic_equations)@xmath21 and ( [ 3 ] ) , @xmath22where @xmath23 is the heaviside function . the temperature field ( eq::temperature_field ) specifies the thermal stress @xmath24 in ( [ eq::coupled_thermoelastic_equations ] ) .",
    "thus , the thermoelastic problem is reduced to solving the 2d plane - strain equation of motion for the displacement @xmath25 in the cylinder cross - section @xmath26 .",
    "divergence of the thermal stress plays the role of a source term .",
    "the equation is complemented by the traction - free boundary condition ( bc ) @xmath27 at the cylinder surface @xmath28 .",
    "consider the above 2d problem in the fourier domain @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the circumferential wave number and @xmath31 the angular frequency . thereafter in this section the factor @xmath32 is omitted , the same notations for the transformed functions are used , and their dependence on @xmath33 is understood and suppressed . according to ( eq::coupled_thermoelastic_equations ) and ( [ eq::temperature_field ] ) , we write@xmath34 \\mathbf{i}+2\\,\\mu \\mathbf{% \\varepsilon } \\left ( r\\right ) , \\",
