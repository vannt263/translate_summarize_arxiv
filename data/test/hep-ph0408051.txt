    "the physical problems which arise in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions or in the study of the very early universe require a consistent treatment of field theory at finite temperature ( ftft )  @xcite . in the context of ftft one of the most fundamental objects",
    "is the partition function , from which all information concerning the equilibrium thermodynamic macroscopic properties of the system can be obtained .",
    "one of such thermodynamic properties is the pressure .",
    "however , it was noted by linde  @xcite that the thermodynamic pressure of the yang - mills theory can not be calculated perturbatively beyond fifth order in the coupling constant .",
    "this is due to the infrared ( ir ) divergences which emerge in ftft .",
    "various nonperturbative approaches has been used in the last decades trying to circumvent the ir problem cited above  @xcite . among these nonperturbative methods ,",
    "are the ones based on the schwinger - dyson equations , the hard thermal loop resummation scheme and others .",
    "in this paper we employ an alternative nonperturbative method , the modified self - consistent resummation ( mscr ) , which we have developed recently  @xcite , to study the infrared behavior of the pressure in the @xmath0 scalar theory in six dimensions .",
    "this model has been chosen due to its similarities to the yang - mills theory .",
    "this problem was firstly studied by almeida and frenkel  @xcite through the schwinger - dyson equations in the ladder approximation and more recently by carrington et al .",
    "@xcite , that certified ( qualitatively ) their results under certain approximations . the mscr resums higher - order terms in a nonperturbative way curing the problem of breakdown of the perturbative expansion .",
    "another advantage of the mscr is that one can sum an infinite subset of diagrams in order to cancel the ir divergences  @xcite .",
    "we show in this work that only one recalculation ( resummation ) of the self - energy , is enough to obtain an ir divergent free result .",
    "we also obtain an analytic ( finite ) expression for the pressure which was computed in two approximations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give the details of our approach , which is based on the mscr formalism and derive an expression for the pressure . in sec .",
    "iii we compare the results obtained by using two approximations to compute the self - energy .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec . iv .",
    "in this section we perform the resummation of an infinite subset of diagrams employing the mscr . to one loop order ,",
    "the self - energy for the massless @xmath0 theory in six dimensions is given by    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a positive coupling constant , @xmath4 is an infrared cutoff , @xmath5 is an ultraviolet cutoff on the momentum integration and @xmath6 is the free massless particle propagator , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . as we are interested in study the infrared behavior of the theory , we take only the zero frequency ( @xmath9 ) terms in the equation above . to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we use the maximization procedure adopted by almeida and frenkel @xcite , @xmath10 in the limit @xmath11 and at leading order we get @xmath12 at the pole of the corrected propagator , we have @xmath13 the mscr dictates that the dressed mass is obtained self - consistently at the pole of the full propagator , in a way that the ( temperature dependent ) divergences can be absorbed  @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath15 is the coefficient of the appropriate temperature dependent counterterm and @xmath16 is expressed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 - 1 ] ) . as we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the resummation in the mscr is achieved by the recalculation of the self - energy .",
    "this first iteration ( recalculation ) of the self - energy correspond to a sum of an infinite subset of daisy - type diagrams .",
    "successive recalculations of the self - energy would turn eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) in @xmath19 this is nothing , but the schwinger - dyson equation for the two - point function evaluated at zero momentum at the pole of the dressed propagator .    to obtain the pressure , let us use the relation @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the free - particle propagator and @xmath22 means that only one - particle - irreducible diagrams enter @xmath23 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath24 , as given by eq . ( [ eq5 ] ) , is the one - loop self - energy plus an infinite subset of diagrams summed nonperturbatively through the mscr .",
    "then , in this approximation , the pressure is @xmath25 let us now evaluate @xmath16 .",
    "as will be clear below , from here now @xmath4 can be set equal to zero with no harm to the pressure , due the presence of @xmath18 .",

    "in fact , as the value of the parameter @xmath33 is small even for @xmath34 , the leading term in eq .",
    "( [ pressuremax ] ) reads    @xmath35",
    "in order to verify the reliability of the maximization procedure employed , we compare its results with results obtained by using feynman parametrization and shifting the integration variable in the computation of the self - energy .",
    "we must remark that this is also an approximate procedure , since no surface effects are taken into account , and the results are valid only in the high temperature limit .",

    "( [ pressuremax ] ) ( maximization procedure ) and ( [ pressurefeyn ] ) ( feynman parametrization ) , as a function of the coupling @xmath3 , for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "in this paper we have considered the effects of the resummation in the study of the infrared behavior of the pressure in the @xmath0 scalar theory in 6 dimensions . for that purpose",
    "we have used the mscr , which resums higher - order terms in a nonperturbative fashion .",
    "the computation of the scalar self - energy has been done both using a maximization procedure proposed by almeida and frenkel as well as the feynman parametrization .",
    "we found that the two approximations agree in the limits analyzed , giving confidence in the procedure we used .",
    "we have shown that only one recalculation of the self - energy , which is equivalent to a sum of an infinite subset of diagrams , is enough to ensure the finiteness of the pressure .",
    "although the results for the self - energy and the pressure given by the two approximations used differ a little bit from each other , they ensue a finite expression for these quantities in the infrared limit .",
    "we note that other approaches like the 2pi  @xcite and the 2ppi  @xcite ( one of its variations ) effective actions are also used to perform systematic selective resummations and furnish nonperturbative results such as the mscr .",
    "for some models recently studied in the literature , and under certain approximations , we could point out some similarities between the mscr and , for instance , the 2pi results .",
    "consider , for example , the 2pi effective potential at finite temperature for the @xmath52 model , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the dressed propagator .",
    "after minimizing @xmath53 with respect to @xmath54 one obtains a gap equation for @xmath54 .",
    "if a hartree form is taken for the dressed propagator  @xcite , @xmath55 , this yields an equation for the effective mass , which is eq .",
    "( [ eq4 - 2 ] ) with @xmath56 in this case , where @xmath57 is the bubble diagram  @xcite .",
    "however , the 2pi effective resums only the two - point correlation function , leaving the vertex as the bare one leading to gauge dependent results for physical quantities .",
    "the gauge dependence of the effective action has been studied by arrizabalaga and smit  @xcite , whereas gauge independent formalisms have been discussed by carrington et .",
    "al  @xcite and j. berges  @xcite .",
    "a modified form of the 2pi effective action has been suggested by mottola  @xcite in order to maintain gauge invariance in qed . since with the mscr",
    "the vertex can be resummed in the same spirit of the two - point functions , it is expected to preserve gauge invariance as well  @xcite .",
    "then we conclude that mscr could serve as an alternative nonperturbative method to calculate the pressure and other physical quantities besides a dyson resummation .",
