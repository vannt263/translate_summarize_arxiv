    "an extensive study of the reactivity of the transition - metal carbide and nitride ( tmx ) surfaces is being performed with the density - functional theory ( dft).@xcite it is aimed at an understanding of reactivity from fundamental principles , similar to the one available today for pure metal surfaces.@xcite due to the intimate relation between bulk and surface electronic structures , a careful mapping of trends in the bulk electronic structure is essential for the overall purpose to understand the trends in reactivity of the transition - metal carbides ( tmc s ) .",
    "therefore , a bulk background focusing on the trends in electronic structure and nature of bonding in the early transition - metal carbides ( tmc ) is here provided .",
    "the relevance of the results is , however , broader , as the bulk tmx s are also interesting by themselves , having such properties as extremely high melting point , ultrahardness , and metallic conductivity.@xcite as a consequence , the importance of the electronic - structure trends for atomic structure and stability is also analyzed .",
    "the bulk tmx s have been studied experimentally and theoretically with a large number of techniques.@xcite already the early studies agree on the fact that the bonding in these compounds involves simultaneous contributions from metallic , covalent , and ionic bonding.@xcite the main electronic - structure properties are related to ( i ) the direction and amount of charge transfer between the tm and x atoms , responsible for the ionicity of the material , and ( ii ) the modifying effect on the metal _ d _ band upon the carbide / nitride formation , responsible for the formation of hybridized bonding and antibonding @xmath0 states .",
    "the decreasing stability of the tmc s in nacl structure from left to right along a period in the periodic table has been explained as arising from the successive filling of the antibonding tm@xmath1c@xmath2 states in a rigid - band model.@xcite    recently , the contributions to the cohesive energy from the tm ",
    " c bonds , respectively , have been approximately determined quantitatively by a two - sublattice model of the nacl structure based on dft calculations.@xcite these results confirm the dominance of the tm ",
    "c bond ( strongest for tic ) and the importance of the tm ",
    "tm bond ( strongest for vc ) .",
    "in addition , they show that direct c  c interactions can not be neglected in some of the considered tmc s ( from crc to nic along period 4 in the periodic table ) .",
    "the used model , however , falls short of explaining such results from the calculated electronic structures .",
    "our systematic dft investigation is performed on a number of non - magnetic early tmc s .",
    "complementary electronic - structure analysis tools are employed in a joined way to obtain detailed information of the bond character : valence - electron density differences , bader charge analyses , band structures , projected densities of states ( dos ) , and real - space wave functions .",
    "key bulk properties are calculated , compared with earlier studies , and analyzed on the basis of the obtained knowledge of the electronic structure .",
    "the studied subgroup of tmc s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tmcs ] ) is chosen to allow a monitoring of trends with respect to the constituent transition metals ( tm ) along both period and group within the periodic table .",
    "also , some of these tmc s are widely used in applications .",
    "we argue that the subgroup is large enough to pick up the important trends .",
    "many tmc s crystallize in the sodium chloride structure , either as stable , including scc ( at normal pressures ) , tic , vc , zrc , nbc , and tac , or metastable compounds , such as @xmath3-moc and wc .",
    "the choice of the tmc s in the nacl structure is natural for our calculations since the number of varying parameters should be kept small when performing a trend study to allow for an identification of the important electronic factors .",

    "the similarities and differences in the nature of bonding in the considered tmc s are studied with the following electron - structure analysis tools : electronic density differences , bader charge analyses,@xcite band structure diagrams , atom - projected local dos s , and kohn - sham wave functions .",

    "our calculated lattice constants are also in quantitative agreement with other published theoretical results , obtained with both the pw91 and the rpbe gga functionals.@xcite    for both the cohesive energies and the bulk moduli the deviations from experiments are larger .",
    "still , our results agree well with other theoretical values.@xcite the deviations from experiments can be understood from the fact that in reality the tmc s often occur as substoichiometric phases , with strongly varying amounts of carbon vacancies .",
    "it is known that several bulk properties depend strongly on such defects.@xcite    the trends in lattice parameters can be understood qualitatively by plotting them against empirical covalent  @xcite and ionic  @xcite radii ( fig .  [",
    "fig : a0_vs_rion_rcov ] ) .",

    "three - dimensional contour plots of the differences between the valence electron densities in the bulk tmc s and the electron densities of free tm and c atoms are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens_diff ] for the considered tmc s .",
    "the changes in the distribution of the valence electrons upon bond creation in the bulk tmc s reveal ( i ) a partially ionic character of the bond , seen as quite localized electron clouds ( orange - red regions ) around the c atoms , indicating a charge transfer from tm to c , and ( ii ) covalent tm  c @xmath10 bonds , seen as a localization of charge ( orange ) in the region in between the tm and c atoms .",
    "our bader analysis results presented in table  [ tab : tmc_a0 ] confirm that the tmc s are partly ionic compounds .",
    "charge is transferred from tm to c for all considered compounds , as expected from the higher electronegativity of c. this direction of the charge transfer is confirmed experimentally by the near - edge x - ray absorption fine structure ( nexafs ) technique.@xcite    the covalent nature of the bonding is most evident in tic and vc , as shown by the charge - difference contours ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dens_diff ] ) and by the lower bader charge transfer for these compounds . in general , the bader charge trends indicate ( i ) an increase in covalency and a decrease in ionicity ( an exception is the metastable @xmath3-moc ) , when moving from left to right along a period , and ( ii ) a decrease in covalency and an increase in ionicity down a group .    all of the considered carbides except moc and wc are stable in the nacl structure .",
    "the electron - density difference alone can not explain why this is the case .",
    "to gain an understanding of the structure change of wc other methods must be employed , including the ones in the next section .",
    "calculated total and atom - projected dos s and band structures for the considered bulk tmc s are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : dos_bulk ] and [ fig : band_structure ] , respectively .",
    "furthermore , complementary information about the bond character for different bands and @xmath11 points is obtained by investigating the real - space kohn - sham wave functions in detail .",
    "such an analysis is performed for all the tmc s .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure ] and a representative selection of the different bond types is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure_psi ] .",
    "the overall electronic structure is similar for all considered tmc s and is characterized by ( i ) a deeply bound lower valence band ( lvb ) with c @xmath12 states and a very small amount of tm @xmath1 states ( not shown in the dos figures for all the tmc s in the given energy interval ) ; ( ii ) a filled ( or , for scc , partly filled ) bonding upper valence band ( uvb ) below @xmath13 , with overlapping c @xmath14 and tm @xmath1 states ; ( iii ) an empty or partly filled antibonding conduction band ( cb ) above or around @xmath13 , dominated by tm @xmath1 states with a clear contribution from c @xmath14 states ; and ( iv ) a non - vanishing dos in the pseudogap between the uvb and the cb .",
    "the contribution to the bonding from the lvb is presumably small due to the small hybridization of the tm and c states . points ( ii ) and ( iii ) illustrate the presence of a covalent bond .",
    "the mainly c @xmath14 and tm @xmath1 characters of the uvb and cb , respectively , indicate a partially ionic bonding nature .",
    "orbital - projected dos s show that the tm states are of predominantly @xmath15 and @xmath16 symmetry in the uvb and in the cb , respectively .",
    "property ( iv ) explains the metallic character of the tmc s .",
    "an analysis of the kohn - sham wave functions along the @xmath11 symmetry lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure ] shows that the band structure is dominated by tm ",
    "c states [ see figs .  [",
    "fig : band_structure_psi](a)-(b ) for representative tm ",
    "c bonds in the case of vc ] .",
    "these states are found throughout the whole energy region of the @xmath11 space , that is , they are present in both the lvb and the uvb , as well as in the cb .",
    "the wave function analysis reveals also that large parts of the states in the lvb and in the lower energy range of the uvb have a bonding c  c character of both @xmath10 and @xmath17 symmetry [ see figs .",
    "[ fig : band_structure_psi](d)(e ) for representative c",
    " c bonds in the case of bulk vc ] .    finally , tm  tm",
    "states are evident in significant parts of both the uvb and the cb [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure_psi](c ) for a representative tm  tm bond in the vc system ] . in all the tmc s , at least one band of tm ",
    "tm character crosses @xmath13 .",
    "the wave function analysis confirms also the picture that the uvb states have a bonding symmetry , while the cb states show a more antibonding character ( _ i.e. _ , nodes in between the atoms ) .",
    "experiments on the band structures for single bulk crystals of group iv - vi tmc s have been carried out by using , for example , angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , in particular x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) for the mapping of occupied bands and inverse photo - emission spectroscopy ( ipes ) for the mapping of unoccupied bands ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "these results agree with the rough features of our calculated results but do not provide any information on the different bond characters of the different bands , which our method is able to give .",
    "the dos figures , together with the band structure and wave function analyses , show that , as the tm group number increases , ( i ) both the uvb and the cb ( as well as the lvb ) are shifted down in energy relative to @xmath13 , due to the filling of bands ; ( ii ) as a consequence the metallicity ( _ i.e. _ , the number of states at @xmath13 ) increases ; ( iii ) the bands crossing @xmath13 show more tm  tm character ; ( iv ) the energy separation between the uvb and the cb decreases ; ( v ) the uvb becomes less c localized ; and ( vi ) the overall amount of c  c states decreases .",
    "as the tm period number increases the following general features are observed in the dos , band structure , and wave function plots : ( i ) the position of @xmath13 relative to the center of mass of the uvb and the cb is unchanged ; ( ii ) the bond character of the different states is largely unchanged ; ( iii ) the energy separation between the uvb and the cb increases ; and ( iv ) the uvb becomes more c localized .",
    "the differences between periods 5 and 6 are smaller than the differences between periods 4 and 5 .",
    "also , a detailed investigation of the band structure reveals that the energetical order of the bands changes : ( i ) at the @xmath18 point the higher tm ",
    "tm band moves up in energy , while tm  c bands move down ; and ( ii ) the two lowest uvb bands at the @xmath19 point ( the c  c and the tm ",
    "tm bands ) approach each other and change places .       and antibonding @xmath20 states",
    "correspond to the uvb and cb of the tmc , respectively . ]",
    "the above trends can be explained on the basis of a two - level system , comprised of the valence @xmath1 and @xmath2 states of the free tm and c atoms , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : twolevel ] ) .",
    "this discussion resembles the one for a heteronuclear diatomic molecule ( see for example ref .  ) . due to the lower electronegativity of the tm atom ,",
    "the energy of the tm @xmath1 state is higher than that of the c @xmath2 state .",
    "their interaction results in bonding @xmath21 and antibonding @xmath20 states , the uvb and the cb , respectively , separated by an energy @xmath22 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : twolevel ] ) . assuming a one - electron picture , the solutions to the schrdinger equation are @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the energy of the tm @xmath1 level and @xmath27 is the energy of the c @xmath2 level , and @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 , which is the case here , there is a charge transfer from tm to c and the bond is partially ionic .    as the tm group number increases , the tm level is shifted down in energy , due to the increase of @xmath1 electrons , giving a better energy overlap between the tm and c states .",
    "this results in a stronger @xmath0 hybridization , a smaller @xmath30 , and a bond of more covalent character , that is , a more similar amount of tm and c localization of the uvb . at the same time , the increase of @xmath1 electrons causes a shift of @xmath13 towards higher energies .",
    "the separation between uvb and cb is given by @xmath31 .",
    "along a period , each extra @xmath1 electron is added in the same valence shell . to a first approximation",
    "one can therefore assume that @xmath32 is constant along a period .",
    "hence , @xmath22 becomes smaller , which is confirmed by our dft calculations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_bulk ] ) .",
    "moving down a group , the number of @xmath1 electrons is constant , leaving @xmath13 at the same energy .",
    "however , the tm level is shifted up in energy , resulting in a smaller @xmath0 hybridization and a larger separation between the tm and the c levels , giving a more ionic bond .",
    "as the separation increases , the closer the resulting levels come to the original ones , giving them more character of the original levels , that is , the uvb ( cb ) becomes more c ( tm)-localized .",
    "this picture is supported by our calculated bader charge - transfer trends ( table  [ tab : tmc_a0 ] ) . to the right along a period , the ionicity decreases , which results in decreasing bader values ( except for @xmath3-moc , as mentioned in sec .  [",
    "sec : dens_diff_bader ] ) . down a group ,",
    "the increase in ionicity is reflected by increasing bader values .",
    "in this paper we present a systematic and detailed trend study of the electronic structure of a collection of early transition - metal carbides based on dft calculations .",
    "the results confirm the mixed iono - covalent tm  c and the metallic tm ",
    "tm nature of the bond .",
    "this is shown both by local dos analyses and by a thorough analysis of the band structures and kohn - sham wave functions along several symmetry lines in the brillouin zone ( fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure ] ) .",
    "c bands are present throughout the whole energy range of the _ k _ space , including the pseudogap between the uvb and the cb .",
    "also , both a bonding and an antibonding tm  tm band are identified .",
    "in addition , our analysis shows that in all the considered tmc s there exist direct c ",
    "c bonds , localized mainly in the lower part of the uvb .",
    "this presence is most pronounced in scc ( where c  c bands cross @xmath13 ) and decreases as the tm group and period numbers increase .",
    "c bonds are also found in the pseudogap .    hence , the c atoms play two roles for the bonding in the tmc s , by their interaction with the tm atoms and with other c atoms , respectively .",
    "the valence - electron density difference analysis shows that the dominating bond character is the iono - covalent tm ",
    "c bond , which is supported by the mapping of bands in the band structure ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : band_structure ] ) . the trends in the covalent and ionic contributions",
    "can be extracted even though these two bonding types are closely intertwined .",
    "we find that the covalent contribution increases from left to right along a period and decreases down a group , while the ionic one decreases from left to right and increases down a group .",
    "in addition , our results show that there is a correlation between the covalency and the separation between the uvb and cb",
    ". a larger covalency corresponds to a larger separation .",
    "although the tm  tm and c  c bonds are not observed in the density difference plots , their existence is revealed by the real - space wave function analysis . a contribution from c ",
    "c bonds to the tmc cohesion has been suggested in ref .",
    "based on a two - sublattice model .",
    "however , such a model does not take into account the modifying effect of the tm @xmath1 states on the c orbitals in the c sublattice , and vice versa .",
    "our approach identifies the different bonding types directly from the calculated electronic structure and therefore includes this modifying effect .",
    "we find that a significant amount of c  c states are present in all the studied tmc s , that is , not only the metastable ones , as was suggested in ref .  .",
    "all the studied tmc s have a metallic bond character , that is , a non - vanishing dos at @xmath13 .",
    "these states ( fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure ] ) are of both tm  tm and tm ",
    "c character ( for scc also c  c states ) .",
    "indeed , measurements show that group iv and v tmc s are almost as good electrical conductors as the parent metals.@xcite with an increasing dos at @xmath13 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : dos_bulk ] ) , and assuming everything else weakly varying , the conductivity should increase from group iv to group vi , which agrees with measurements.@xcite on the same arguments , the conductivity of scc should be comparable to that of vc .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bulk_geometry ] , along a period the calculated cohesive energies exhibit a maximum for group iv .",
    "the calculated electronic structure shows that for group iv , @xmath13 is positioned in the pseudogap between the uvb and the cb , meaning that all the bonding uvb states are filled and all the antibonding cb states are empty .",
    "the same arguments as in the case of the bonding energy in a diatomic molecule can be applied , that is , a filling of bonding states increases the bond strength , while filling of antibonding states reduces the bond strength.@xcite for scc , not all bonding uvb states are filled and therefore the cohesive energy is lower for this compound . for groups v and vi , the antibonding cb states are partly filled , which again results in a weaker bond .    down",
    "a group , the cohesive energies of the tmc s increase .",
    "this is because the uvb is shifted down in energy , making the bond stronger , while the cb is shifted up in energy , resulting in an energy gain due to the emptying of antibonding states .",
    "the band structure and kohn - sham wave function analyses show the origin of the instabillity of moc and wc in nacl structure .",
    "the instability arises from the filling of antibonding states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure ] . in moc , the tm ",
    "tm antibonding band around @xmath18 is partly filled . in wc , two additional antibonding bands , of w ",
    "c character , cross @xmath13 around the @xmath18 point and become partly occupied .",
    "this picture agrees with previous studies  @xcite but also provides additional details .",
    "the detailed analysis of the electronic structure provided in this study lays the essential foundation for the understanding of the tmc s surface properties , such as their surface reactivity .",
    "the surface characteristics of a material are tightly bound to its underlying bulk properties , and will of course depend strongly on the type of bonds that are broken upon creation of the surface .",
    "it is , for example , known that the surface electronic structure of the tmc ( 100 ) surfaces is similar to that of the bulk .",
    "however , the tmc ( 111 ) surface shows both tm - localized as well as c - localized surface resonances.@xcite the importance of these resonances on the surface reactivity is investigated in refs .   and  .",
    "this trend study deals with the bonding nature of early tmc s .",
    "our approach is based on a complementary use of different types of electronic - structure analysis tools . in particular",
    ", a thorough mapping of the band structure provides detailed insight into the bonding of the bulk tmc s .",
    "the results ( i ) confirm that the dominant contribution to the bond is the iono - covalent tm ",
    "c bond , ( ii ) show the existence of tm ",
    "tm bonds , and , importantly , ( iii ) reveal the existence of direct c ",
    "c bonds ( most pronounced for scc ) .",
    "we provide new information on the spatial extent of the different bonds , on their _",
