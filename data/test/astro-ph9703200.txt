    "discovered by g. candeo at m@xmath0 = 14.5 on 1986 april 13 in ngc 4302 ( rosino 1986 ) , with a precise optical position of ra(b1950 ) = @xmath1 , decl(b1950 ) = @xmath2 given by king ( 1986 ) , sn 1986e attracted little initial attention from observers . recently , interest in the sn has revived with discovery of late time optical emission ( cappellaro , danziger , & turatto 1995 ) , a relatively rare phenomenon for supernovae ( sne ) , leading to a comparison with other late time optical emitting sne 1957d , 1970 g , 1979c , and 1980k ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1995 ; see also ryder et al .",
    "1993 for sn 1978k , and rupen et al .",
    "1987 and leibundgut et al .",
    "1991 for sn 1986j ) . due to these optical similarities and , since all are radio supernovae ( rsne ) , cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1995 ) predicted possible radio emission for sn 1986e with flux density as high as 0.5 - 5 mjy at 20 cm in 1995 , @xmath39 years after optical discovery .",
    "this prediction was followed by a search for radio emission in 1995 by eck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who were unable to detect the sn with very low limits at both 6 cm ( s@xmath4 @xmath5 0.038 mjy ; 3@xmath6)@xmath7 and 20 cm ( s@xmath8 @xmath5 0.169 mjy ; 3@xmath6 ) . due to this apparent lack of radio emission , eck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) concluded that sn 1986e is surprising in being apparently radio faint and suggested that it is the first old sn that has been seen in the optical but not the radio .",
    "this work by cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and by eck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) has prompted us to reexamine observations taken with the very large array ( vla ) of sn 1986e at times closer to the explosion date , one of which had showed a possible , weak detection . applying additional processing , we were able to obtain a clear detection of sn 1986e at 6 cm on 1986 december 05 and to establish a number of new upper limits at both 6 and 20 cm .",
    "these new data constrain rather well the range of possible models for the radio emission from sn 1986e , so that a comparison with other type iil sne such as sn 1979c and sn 1980k can be made . from these results",
    "we conclude that the cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1995 ) predicted flux density for sn 1986e is far too high and , while sn 1986e was probably a reasonably typical type iil sn in its radio emission , that eck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) failed to detect it due to limited vla sensitivity and the relatively large age of the sn at the time of their search .",
    "a number of observations were taken of sn 1986e at 6 cm wavelength ( 4.860 ghz ) and 20 cm ( 1.425 ghz ) with the vla over an interval extending from 17 days to 991 days after the optical discovery .",
    "the observations were calibrated with assumed flux densities for the primary calibrator 3c286 of 14.45 jy at 1.425 ghz and 7.42 jy at 4.860 ghz . following the normal procedure for the vla ,",
    "3c286 was used to obtain flux densities for the compact secondary , possibly variable , calibrator 1252 + 119 , which was then used as both amplitude and phase calibrator for observations of the sn 1986e field .",
    "( more details of vla calibration procedures for sn observations can be found in weiler et al .",
    "1986 and , particularly for 1252 + 119 , in weiler et al . 1991 . )",
    "the derived flux densities for 1252 + 119 used for amplitude calibration are listed in table 1 and the position of 1252 + 119 used for phase calibration was ra(b1950 ) = @xmath9 , decl(b1950 ) = @xmath10 .",
    "the results of the observations of sn 1986e are listed , along with the two limits from eck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , in table 1 .    as is apparent from table 1",
    ", one of the observations of sn 1986e resulted in a weak , but significant detection of 0.304 @xmath11 0.034 mjy at 6 cm on 1986 december 05 .",
    "the radio position of the emission of ra(b1950 ) = @xmath12 , decl(b1950 ) = @xmath13 agrees with the optical ( king 1986 ) position to within 1  .",
    "this positional coincidence , along with the lack of detection of any similar level of emission both before and after the single detection date , indicates that the emission almost certainly is from sn 1986e .",
    "a 6 cm contour map of the area around the position of sn 1986e is shown in figure 1 with the emission from the sn indicated .",
    "two relatively strong background sources , labeled @xmath14 and @xmath15 by eck et al . ( 1996 ) , are clearly seen in figure 1 .",
    "the eck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) source @xmath16 , while outside of the field shown in figure 1 , was also detected .",
    "the 6 cm flux densities for these three field sources , taken as an average of the results from 1986 august 11 ( b - array ) and 1986 december 05 ( c - array ) are listed in table 2 . an observation from 1987 august 28",
    "was not used for table 2 because the high resolution of the a - array on that date partially resolved the sources .",
    "the positions for the three field sources ( source @xmath14 : ra(b1950 ) = @xmath17 , decl(b1950 ) = @xmath18 ; source @xmath15 : ra(b1950 ) = @xmath19 , decl(b1950 ) = @xmath20 ; source @xmath16 : ra(b1950 ) = @xmath21 , decl(b1950 ) = @xmath22 ) are in good agreement with the results of eck et al .",
    "weiler et al . ( 1986 ) discuss the common properties of radio sne ( rsne ) , including nonthermal synchrotron emission with high brightness temperature , turn - on delay at longer wavelengths , power - law decline after maximum with index @xmath14 , and spectral index @xmath23 asymptotically decreasing to an optically thin value .",
    "weiler et al . (",
    "1986 ) have also shown that the `` mini - shell '' model of chevalier ( 1982a , b ) adequately describes known type iil rsne . in this model , the relativistic electrons and enhanced magnetic fields",
    "necessary for synchrotron emission are generated by the sn shock interacting with a relatively high - density ionized circumstellar envelope .",
    "this dense cocoon is presumed to have been established by a high mass - loss rate ( @xmath24   @xmath25   10@xmath26 @xmath27   yr@xmath28 ) , low velocity ( @xmath29   @xmath3 10  km  s@xmath28 ) wind from a red supergiant ( rsg ) sn progenitor which was ionized and heated by the initial sn uv / x - ray flash . the rapid rise in radio flux density results from the shock overtaking progressively more of the wind matter , leaving less of it along the line - of - sight to absorb the emission from the shock region .    following weiler et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , we adopt the parameterized model : @xmath30 where @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 corresponding , formally , to the flux density ( @xmath32 ) and uniform absorption ( @xmath33 ) at 5  ghz one day after the explosion date @xmath34 .",
    "the term @xmath35 describes the attenuation of a local medium that uniformly covers the emitting source ( `` uniform external absorption '' ) .",
    "this absorbing medium is assumed to be purely thermal , ionized hydrogen with frequency dependence @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 ( not to be confused with source @xmath16 from eck et al .",
    "1996 ) describes the time dependence of the optical depth for this local , uniform medium . for an undecelerated sn shock ,",
    "@xmath16 = -3 is appropriate ( chevalier , 1982a ) .",
    "this parameterization has been found generally applicable to other type iil sne , such as sn 1979c ( weiler et al .",
    "1991 ) and sn 1980k ( weiler et al . 1992 ) , with values of @xmath16 close to the undecelerated value ( @xmath37 = -3.12 , @xmath38 = -2.74 , see table 3 ) .",
    "with only the one radio detection available in table 1 , it is certainly not possible to determine the 6 parameters ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath23 , @xmath14 , @xmath16 , @xmath34 ) in eqs . 1 and 2 through a fitting procedure .",
    "however , if we assume no shock deceleration ( @xmath16 = -3 ) , if we assign a `` typical '' spectral index for a type iil rsn of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 = -0.73 , @xmath41 = -0.58 , see table 3 ) , and if we take @xmath34 = -30 days before optical maximum ( optical discovery date in the case of sn 1986e ) , as we did for sn 1980k ( weiler et al .",
    "1992 ) , only @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath14 remain undetermined .",
    "this is still too many parameters to determine unambiguously from only one detection , but through the use of the 3@xmath6 upper limits available at 6 cm on 1986 august 11 ( 4 months before the detection ) and on 1987 august 28 ( 8 months after the detection ) , we can place limits on their possible values .",
    "these are listed in table 3 and the resulting model radio light curves are shown along with the available data in figure 2 .    accepting these limits for @xmath32 and @xmath14 ,",
    "the two parameters which predict the late time radio behavior , implies that sn 1986e would have had a flux density @xmath5 0.060 mjy at 20 cm on 1995 july 14 and @xmath5 0.026 mjy at 6 cm on 1995 december 04 , the epochs of the eck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) observations .",
    "these are both less than their reported 3@xmath6 upper limits ( see table 1 ) and consistent with their non - detection of the sn in the radio at those times and frequencies .",
    "using these `` best estimate '' parameters for sn 1986e and taking a distance to ngc 4302 of 16.8 mpc ( tully 1988 ) yields a 6 cm peak spectral luminosity of @xmath42 @xmath43 1.1 @xmath44 10@xmath45 erg s@xmath28 hz@xmath28 .",
    "although more than an order of magnitude less radio luminous than sn 1979c at peak ( @xmath46 erg s@xmath28 hz@xmath28 , see table 3 ) , sn 1986e is comparable in 6 cm peak luminosity to sn 1980k ( @xmath42 = 1.0 @xmath44 10@xmath45 erg s@xmath28 hz@xmath28 , see table 3 ) .    further , using the parameters from table 3 and the formulation of weiler et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , eq .",
    "16 , we can obtain an estimate of the ratio of the presupernova mass loss rate ( @xmath24 ) to presupernova stellar wind velocity ( @xmath29 ) of @xmath47 4.7 @xmath44   10@xmath26  @xmath27 yr@xmath28 ( km   s@xmath28)@xmath28 or @xmath48 4.7 @xmath44   10@xmath49  @xmath27 yr@xmath28 ( @xmath50 = 1.9 @xmath44   10@xmath51  @xmath27 yr@xmath28 , @xmath52 = 2.0 @xmath44   10@xmath49  @xmath27 yr@xmath28 , see table 3 ) , for the commonly assumed parameters of @xmath53 10 km s@xmath28 , t = 20,000 k , and @xmath54 13,000 km s@xmath28 .",
    "a comparison of the model and physical parameters derived for sn 1986e , sn 1979c , and sn 1980k is shown in table 3 .",
    "as is clear from examination of table 3 , sn 1986e was likely a fairly typical type iil sn with properties somewhat similar to those of sn 1980k .",
    "although our radio data sample is extremely limited with only one detection at one frequency , by including new upper limits it is possible to show , with reasonable assumptions and parameter estimates , that sn 1986e was probably a fairly `` normal '' type iil sn in its radio behavior .",
    "the best parameter estimates imply that the late time radio upper limits determined by eck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) are not in conflict with the estimated properties of sn 1986e , and their conclusion that sn 1986e represents the first example of a late time optically detectable sn which has not been seen in the radio is not supported .",
    "sn 1986e could , in fact , have been rather similar to sn 1980k .",
    "thus , the strong correlation between the presence of radio emission and late time optical emission is maintained .",
