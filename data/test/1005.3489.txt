    "are observed to form , whilst carbon - rich environments give rise to amorphous carbon , graphite and sic .",
    "metallic iron grains , however , produce featureless infrared emission which can be difficult to differentiate from other sources , particularly amorphous carbon dust .",
    "iron has hitherto only been inferred as a likely component of oxygen - rich dusty winds @xcite , but never positively identified .",
    "previous observational studies @xcite of giant stars in globular clusters have found a featureless contribution in addition to the flux emanating from the star s photosphere , which has been attributed to an unidentified circumstellar dust species .",
    "we herein show that this dust species is metallic iron .",
    "our sample consists of 35 highly - evolved , ( strongly-)pulsating stars in globular clusters @xcite ( paper i ) , observed using the _ spitzer space telescope _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) .",
    "these long - period variable stars lie near or above the red giant branch tips of 19 galactic globular clusters , which range in metallicity from [ fe / h ] = 1.62 to 0.10 .",

    "silicate features at 10 and 20 @xmath0 m are seen in 24 objects , implying oxygen - rich chemistry .",
    "more pertinently , the remaining ten stars either have very weak silicate features or appear to be ` naked ' .",
    "@xmath3-band light curves are also available ( paper i ) for 25 of our 34 objects , which allows us to construct the photometric fluxes of these objects at the pulsation phase of their irs spectrum .",
    "figure [ excess2fig ] shows the @xmath4[8 ] colour for these objects , where the 8-@xmath0 m photometry was derived by convolving the irs spectrum with the _ spitzer _ irac 8-@xmath0 m filter .",

    "all 25 stars , however , have a positive colour .",
    "this implies a flux excess at 8 @xmath0 m which can not be caused by commonly - assumed dust species ( silicates , alumina ) under normal conditions of temperature and grain size . this excess flux at long wavelengths",
    "is confirmed by comparison to marcs photospheric model spectra @xcite as shown below .    from our sample ,",
    "four example stars have been selected for detailed modelling : ngc 5927 v3 , a highly - evolved agb star with a strong , narrow , 10-@xmath0 m silicate feature ; ngc 6352 v5 , a less luminous giant star with unusual dust features ; and ngc 362 v2 and ngc 5139 v42 , ` naked ' rgb - tip or agb stars showing optical tio bands ( indicating they are oxygen - rich ) and infrared dust excesses , but no silicate features ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "being very similar objects near the giant branch tip , we expect the effective surface temperature _ below the dust - producing zone _ to be 3750 @xmath15250 k. we use the near - infrared flux to fit the photospheric continuum .",
    "a low - temperature , metal - rich model therefore represents an intentional bias toward a model with a more - luminous infrared spectrum compared to its near - infrared flux .",
    "this reduces the calculated excess to rule out disparity between the modelled and real photospheric spectra .",
    "figure [ examplefig ] shows the observed spectra , alongside fits to the stellar wind contribution using dusty @xcite . using the marcs model atmosphere as an input , we fit a stellar wind model using metallic iron grains @xcite . for each model",
    "we assume a radiatively - driven wind ; and a standard mathis - rumpl - nordsieck grain size distribution @xcite , given by @xmath16 , @xmath17 for @xmath18 nm .",
    "we correct for interstellar reddening using the absorption profiles from @xcite .",
    "we further assume that @xmath19 and that @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath8 values for ngc 362 , 5927 and 6352 are from @xcite , @xmath21 is assumed for @xmath22 cen , based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the correction applied is thus quite small and negligibly different from that applied in paper i.    ngc 362 v2 and @xmath22 cen v42 are best fit with a dust shell truncated to an outer radius ( @xmath23 ) of @xmath24100 times the inner radius ( @xmath25 the dust formation radius ) .",
    "( normally , fits are extended to @xmath26 . )",
    "this suppresses the flux at @xmath27 m .",
    "a similar effect can also be achieved by using a grain distribution with fewer large grains : both effects may be in play ( we only model a truncated shell here ) . the strength , and indeed existence of",
    ", this suppression depends crucially on the subtraction of the infrared background ( caused by galactic interstellar medium and other cluster objects ) .",
    "while every effort has been made to make sure this has been done correctly , we can not be conclusively sure that such a suppression and thus truncation exist .    in ngc 5927 v3 and ngc 6352 v5 ,",
    "we also observe other dust species , which emit at @xmath28 m .",
    "identified species include silicates ( magnesium - rich olivines and pyroxenes ) at 10 and 20 @xmath0 m and amorphous alumina ( al@xmath9o@xmath10 ) at 1115 @xmath0 m ( optical constants from @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "related crystalline minerals with a smaller degree of amorphisation are likely responsible for the sharp 9.6- and 13.1-@xmath0 m features seen in ngc 6352 v5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that the fit to ngc 5927 v3 produces a fairly good match to the 10-@xmath0 m feature , but at a wavelength which is too red .",
    "this can be caused by a number of factors , including grain size and porosity @xcite .",
    "the 20-@xmath0 m feature has an unknown carrier : a promising candidate is magnesio - wstite ( mg@xmath29fe@xmath30o ; see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; paper i ) .",
    "this provides a good fit to the feature in ngc 6352 v5 .",
    "the comparatively - red peak wavelength seen in ngc 6352 v5 further suggests that @xmath31 : i.e.  that it is near - pure feo @xcite",
    ". we return to this feature later .",
    "we could not fit a single - temperature dust model to these two stars , implying that the dust species are not in thermal contact with each other .",
    "iron and alumina were fit at temperatures of @xmath241000 k. in ngc 6352 v5 , silicates and feo were fit at @xmath24450 k ; in ngc 5927 v3 , the strong 10-@xmath0 m peak suggests mainly glassy silicates , which we fit at @xmath24400 k.    table [ exampletable ] lists our fitted parameters , including dust temperatures at the outer and inner edges of the dust envelope ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) and the size of the envelope used ( @xmath13 , @xmath34 r@xmath35 ) .",
    "we do not include mass - loss rates , as explained at the end of this section .",
    "featureless infrared excess can be produced by a variety of circumstellar material .",
    "this can take the form of free - free emission , emission from shells of molecular gas ( a ` molsphere ' ; e.g.  @xcite ) , extremely - large silicate grains , or amorphous carbon grains .",
    "figure [ modelsfig ] shows modelled fits for these possible emission sources , modelled in an identical way to the iron fits listed above .",
    "ionisation in a chromosphere or shock fronts propagating through the outer atmosphere can give rise to free - free emission , as observed by radio observations toward galactic miras @xcite .",
    "the optical depth of free - free emission in a region of thickness @xmath36 can be calculated as : @xmath37 where the electron density , @xmath38 , is recoverable from the electron temperature , @xmath39 , via the saha equation . at low frequencies , where @xmath40 , the emission scales as @xmath41 for an isothermal , isobaric region ; and @xmath42 for an isothermal wind expanding with constant velocity . for @xmath22 cen v42",
    ", we find our spectrum would require @xmath43 at 34 @xmath0 m , and that @xmath44 for @xmath40 .",
    "this more - closely approximates an isobaric density profile , which would be difficult to achieve in an expanding wind .",
    "very similar conditions would have to exist in all 34 of our stars , as the shape of their spectra are very similar .",
    "an isobaric chromosphere producing a spectrum with this optical depth can not exist except in the following case : the wind must be mostly ionised ( @xmath45 k ) _ and _",
    "either the chromosphere extends to an unphysical radius ( @xmath46 r@xmath47 ) and/or the mass - loss rate becomes unphysical ( @xmath48 m@xmath7 yr@xmath49 ) for a thermally - expanding wind .",
    "departing from an isobaric state makes conditions even more prohibitive .",
    "while chromospheres may be present in these stars , this infrared excess is not seen in chromospherically - active stars that are less evolved @xcite . in v42 ,",
    "circumstellar ionisation appears dominated by pulsation shocks .",
    "@xcite show that , for galactic miras , the temperature and density increases provided by shocks in the outer atmosphere are insufficient to produce an ionised layer that would be optically thick in the infrared .",
    "we thus rule out free - free emission as a dominant contributor to our spectra .",
    "the molsphere creates a dense ` forest ' of molecular lines .",
    "water lines are the most important , and cause emission throughout the spectrum , but mainly in the 68-@xmath0 m and @xmath50 m regions .",
    "this emission is seen in some of our example stars ( paper i ) . however , the water bands in our spectra are very weak compared to stars with naked molspheres ( e.g.  @xmath51 peg  @xcite ) .",
    "gas - phase model emission spectra ( figure [ modelsfig ] ) , created from the line list of @xcite using spectrafactory @xcite , fail to reproduce the flatness of the spectrum for any reasonable combination of temperature and column density .",
    "figure [ modelsfig ] shows the highest column density we consider feasible , and even this contains @xmath52 m@xmath7 of water or @xmath240.01% of the star s oxygen .",
    "furthermore , most molsphere host stars still require an extra opacity source ( such as iron grains ) providing flux at 68@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "infrared molecular emission should therefore not make a significant contribution to our spectra .    of the commonly - considered dust species only metallic iron and amc produce a featureless infrared continuum that matches the observed ` naked ' spectra .",
    "other dust species ( e.g.  graphite ) produce either strong spectral features or inflections which do not fit observed spectra .",
    "spectral features can be damped by unusual conditions , notably exceptionally large grains @xcite : these can not simultaneously reproduce both the excess at @xmath53 m and @xmath54 m at the observed levels ( figure [ modelsfig ] ) and are not expected in metal - poor stars where grain growth may be hampered by a lack of constituent elements .",
    "observationally , amc can also provide an acceptable fit to our example stars over most of the spectrum .",
    "the remaining discrepancies may be fixable by fine - tuning the wind parameters ( grain size , density distributions , temperatures , background subtraction , etc . ) .",
    "detection of amc as dominant dust species in an oxygen - rich environment would be unexpected . in giant stars ,",
    "carbon and oxygen are bound into co near the stellar surface , locking away the least abundant element .",
    "the remaining majority element , either carbon or oxygen , dominates the dust chemistry .",
    "co may be dissociated in atmospheric shock waves or by chromospheric uv irradiation @xcite .",
    "this can lead to the production of small amonuts of other carbon - rich molecules : mainly co@xmath9 ( observed in our stars : see paper i ) , but also hcn and cs @xcite .",
    "small quantities of carbon - rich dust may then form @xcite , though oxygen - rich dust production is still expected to be dominant .",
    "in our sample , however , the featureless component often appears to be the dominant species , and no evidence for oxygen - rich dust is found .",
    "having ruled out the alternatives , we conclude that the source of the dust excess must be iron grains , and that these must dominate the condensed material in some stars .",
    "if we navely assume identical populations of spherical grains , the fraction of warm silicates in the ` naked ' stars being @xmath55 1% of the iron content ( figure [ modelsfig ] ; the same would be true at a @xmath55 3% level for an amc component ) .",
    "the silicate fraction may increase if iron grains are made smaller and oblate , thus presenting a higher cross - section per unit mass : extreme needle - like grains are required if silicates are to become the dominant dust species by mass . as we do not know the grain shape , it becomes difficult to estimate a mass - loss rate for an iron wind .",
    "spherical grains produce unfeasibly low expansion velocities of order @xmath24 m s@xmath49 for a pure iron wind ; expansion velocities for ngc 5927 v3 and ngc 6352 v5 were not calculated as the model assumes a zero initial velocity for both temperature components , which will not be the case if they form at different radii . the mass - loss rates and expansion velocities",
    "can also be significantly modified by altering , e.g. , the grain size or density ( single crystal vs. conglomerate ) , but reasonable changes still fail to produce feasible values , except for extremely elongated grains .",
    "this implies that iron alone may not be able to drive a dusty wind in these stars .",
    "other factors may also accelerate the wind .",
    "these could include small amounts of amorphous carbon @xcite ; energy deposition either from shocks created by stellar pulsations ( @xcite ) , or magnetic reconnection ( @xcite ) ; increased opacity from circumstellar molecular gas ( @xcite ) ; stellar pulsation , either by direct acceleration or dissipation of shocks ; line - driving of h i or ca ii atoms , or h@xmath9o molecules ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the driving mechanism is thus likely to be complex , with radiation pressure on metallic iron being only one of several accelerants which drive matter from the star . obtaining an accurate radial profile of the wind s outflow velocity will be crucial in determining which",
    "factors dominate this acceleration .",
    "efficient production of metallic iron by oxygen - rich agb stars would explain several iron depletions .",
    "gas - phase depletion of iron extends to the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "iron grains contribute to infrared emission from this medium @xcite and iron is seen to be destroyed in shocks @xcite .",
    "iron is also depleted by @xmath56%  in the gas phase of planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "direct evidence for iron condensation in agb winds comes from depletion patterns in binary post - agb stars . in these stars ,",
    "the wind is captured in a circumbinary disk , from where gas re - accretes onto the star .",
    "these stars show large depletions of refractory elements , with iron being among the most depleted @xcite thus indicate a history of iron - rich dust production .",
    "the 20-@xmath0 m feature , seen in ngc 6352 v5 , is also observed in ngc 5927 v1 and terzan 5 v6 .",
    "it has a width ( fwhm ) of @xmath57 m and a line - to - continuum ratio up to 50% .",
    "this feature has previously been seen in low mass - loss stars ; it correlates with the presence of an 11-@xmath0 m shoulder , and 13.1- and 28-@xmath0 m peaks @xcite .",
    "the related peaks are also present in our sample , and we confirm that the 20-@xmath0 m feature disappears for more evolved ( i.e.  more luminous ) stars .",
    "the 20-@xmath0 m and associated features are barely detectable in the naked stars , strongest in stars with weak silicate emission and disappear when silicates dominate ( figure [ mbolfehfig ] ) .",
    "this suggests they are produced either during the formation or destruction of silicate grains .",
    "the identification of the feature with mg@xmath29fe@xmath30o is unconfirmed mainly because it does not predict the associated features , but the proposed identifications for those ( corundum , pyroxenes ) @xcite do not provide good fits at 20 @xmath0 m , making it plausible that a range of minerals form under these conditions .",
    "we suggest that these features may be caused by the chemical modification of silicate grains : silicate grains which adsorb iron into the lattice have higher opacity , and can be heated until the iron - bearing component dissociates from the grain @xcite .",
    "this is expected to occur at any radius from the star at which dust formation is efficient @xcite . in this model , metallic iron",
    "is produced first , but at higher metallicity and mass loss rates , the iron becomes partly incorporated into other grain types including iron - oxide and iron - containing silicates .",
    "studies of inclusions within meteoric primitive solar system material have traced dust grains to specific origins in agb stars , supernovae and novae , through their isotopic ratios @xcite .",
    "recently , the first pre - solar iron - oxide grain has been identified @xcite .",
    "the iron and oxygen isotopic ratios in it are indicative of an origin in an agb star .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that agb stars are a source of interstellar iron dust , and have contributed to the solar system s iron content .",
    "figure [ mbolfehfig ] shows the variation of dust types ( see paper i ) with bolometric magnitude and metallicity .",
    "silicate - rich winds are only seen at high luminosity or high metallicity , with iron dominating the outflow in lower - luminosity , lower - metallicity stars .",
    "this indicates that the dust condensation sequence depends on metallicity and luminosity .",
    "@xcite show that , under equilibrium conditions , iron is only expected to condense before silicates in regions with high gas pressure .",
    "if this applies to our stars , it implies high gas pressure at low metallicity and/or low luminosity , as may be expected if the outflow velocities where iron condenses ( at the outside edge of the molsphere ) are very low . under non - equilibrium conditions ,",
    "grain growth chemistry is strongly controlled by kinetics @xcite , which may favour the formation of iron .    in @xcite ,",
    "silicates form before iron at lower densities and temperatures .",
    "the restriction of silicates towards higher metallicity and luminosity ( figure [ mbolfehfig ] ) suggests that their circumstellar envelopes are more extended , favouring silicates .",
    "silicate production is expected to increase with both stellar metallicity and luminosity @xcite .",
    "using mid - infrared spectra and photometry , we have shown that there is a considerable amount of unattributed infrared flux in a large selection of globular cluster giants . through radiative transfer modelling , we deduce that this flux is most likely due to metallic iron grains forming in a truncated stellar wind , corroborated by a potential identification of feo with the 20-@xmath0 m emission feature .",
    "the production of metallic iron seems to become more dominant at lower metallicity , suggesting that the dust condensation sequence is fundamentally different in metal - poor objects .",
    "large - scale production of iron grains and iron oxide in agb stars can explain iron depletion in the gas and solid phases of the post - agb stars and planetary nebulae ; as well as isotopic ratios in feo grains in meteorites .",
    "while iron increases opacity in oxygen - rich winds , it remains unclear whether it can dominate driving of metal - poor winds .",
    "future observations to determine outflow velocities in these stars should help determine the driver of these stellar winds",
