    "this converse magnetoelectric coupling relies on mechanical deformations of the ferroelectric layer caused by the converse piezoelectric effect , or by ferroelectric / ferroelastic domain reconfigurations .",
    "these elastic strain changes are transferred into the ferromagnetic thin film clamped onto the ferroelectric layer , modifying its magnetic properties due to magnetoelastic effects.@xcite in total , converse magnetoelectric effects in multiferroic hybrids can be described phenomenologically by a product tensor property including piezoelectric and mangetoelastic effects.@xcite thus , a detailed understanding of these effects and the elastic coupling across the interface is mandatory to predict magnetoelectric effects in novel multiferroic hybrid structures .    as a first step , we here investigate magnetization changes caused by magnetoelastic effects in batio@xmath0 ( bto ) based extrinsic multiferroic hybrid structures using both fe@xmath1co@xmath1 ( feco ) and ni as ferromagnetic materials .",

    "were observed caused by strain changes of the respective ferromagnetic thin film , which are induced by the structural phase transitions of bto .",
    "however , the experimental results could hardly be explained in a quantitative manner , since ferroelectric bto forms a multi - domain state upon crossing the phase transitions without any external field applied to the crystal .",
    "this nonuniform strain state is induced into the overlying ferromagnetic thin film and causes changes of its magnetic properties . in particular , since the volume fraction of the domains in each ferroelastic phase of bto may not exhibit the same value upon cooling down or warming up the hybrid structure , a different behavior of the overlying ferromagnetic thin film was observed during decreasing and increasing temperature.@xcite this demonstrates , it is essential to control both the ferromagnetic and ferroelastic domain configuration in order to correctly describe the manipulation of the magnetization in bto - based multiferroic hybrid structures .    by using miscut bto substrates , we show that the magnetization changes of multiferroic hybrid structures can indeed be predicted on the basis of first - principles effective hamiltonian simulations . to calculate these changes ,",

    "[ fig : fig6](a ) , ( b ) ] fairly well . as discussed in the context of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , the magnetic anisotropy visible throughout the investigated temperature range can be attributed to the presence of ferroelastic @xmath10- and @xmath11-domains during the deposition of feco .",
    "while the magnetic anisotropy observable in the tetragonal phase of bto is caused by ferroelastic @xmath11-domains , the difference of @xmath126 and @xmath127 in the orthorhombic phase can mainly be attributed to a finite volume fraction of ferroelastic @xmath10-domains .",
    "thus , by controlling the ferroelastic state of the bto crystal during the fabrication process , the desired magnetic anisotropy can be adjusted in the whole temperature range .    despite of the large magnetoelastic coupling constants of feco",
    ", the changes of the magnetization projections @xmath126 and @xmath127 do not exceed 25% .",
    "this is mainly caused by the low @xmath82 value of @xmath128 .",
    "however , @xmath82 values up to @xmath129 were measured in ni / bto hybrid samples . as an example , squid magnetometry measurements and the corresponding simulations of the temperature dependent magnetization",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "the external magnetic field was applied along the @xmath39-direction of the hybrid structure .",
    "moreover , the elastic and magnetoelastic constants published in refs .   were used for the simulations . as obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , an excellent agreement between experiment and simulation was obtained for @xmath130% , @xmath131% , and @xmath132 . in this sample ,",
    "variations of the magnetization of up to 70% can be observed at the orthorhombic - rhombohedral phase transition .",
    "unfortunately , these large changes are not persistent and can only be achieved shortly after the deposition .",
    "one explanation is the presence of mechanical fatigue , which is expected to lead to two effects .",
    "first , mechanical fatigue can occur in the bto crystal , which in turn reduces the converse piezoelectric strain .",
    "second , the elastic coupling between the ferromagnetic thin film and the bto crystal might be reduced .",
    "in contrast to ferroelectric fatigue effects , the detailed understanding of mechanical fatigue is still lacking . to clarify this issue is of particular technological importance for strain - mediated multiferroic hybrid structures.@xcite however , the excellent agreement between experiment and simulation clearly demonstrates that the magnetoelastic behavior in ferromagnetic / bto multiferroic hybrid structures is well understood .",
    "this paves the way for engineering novel multiferroic composite hybrid structures .",
    "we have investigated magnetoelastic effects in bto - based multiferroic hybrid structures using feco and ni as ferromagnetic thin film .",
    "as bto exhibits different ferroelectric / ferroelastic phases , its strain state can be modified by simply controlling the temperature of the bto crystal .",
    "this allowed us to study one and the same ferromagnetic thin film under different elastic constraints .",
    "our detailed analysis showed that a ferroelectric / ferroelastic domain control is mandatory to ensure a predictable , homogeneous strain state of the bto crystal . to this end , we used miscut bto substrates and applied a sufficiently large electric field along the out - of - plane direction so that a single ferroelastic domain becomes energetically favorable in each ferroelastic phase .",
    "this enabled us to calculate the strain state of the bto crystal as a function of temperature by means of md simulations based on a first - principles effective hamiltonian .",
    "since the ferromagnetic thin film deposited on top of the bto crystal is elastically clamped to the bto substrate in our multiferroic hybrid structures , each modification of the in - plane strain components leads to changes of the strain state of the ferromagnetic thin film .",
    "thus , with the knowledge of the elastic behavior of bto , we could calculate the strain state of the overlying ferromagnetic thin film using a phenomenological thermodynamic model .",
    "the calculation revealed , as expected , large strain changes around the natural phase transitions of bto .",
    "employing magnetoelastic theory , we were able to simulate the magnetic behavior of the ferromagnetic thin film on the basis of the elastic behavior derived from md simulations . by comparing the results of these simulations to experimental data",
    ", we clearly demonstrated that the magnetic properties of bto - based multiferroic hybrid structures can be theoretically modeled on the basis of first - principles md simulations .",
    "this opens the way to design novel multiferroic composite hybrid structures .",
