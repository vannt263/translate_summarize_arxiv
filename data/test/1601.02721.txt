    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "a large fraction of the bh xrbs are close binaries with orbital periods @xmath2 day .",
    "the spectral types of the companion stars range from a2v to m1v , indicating that most of them are less massive than @xmath3 , so these xrbs are correspondingly classified as low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "all known bh lmxbs are transient systems , spending most of their time in quiescence with x - ray luminosities below @xmath4 , and occasionally exhibiting outbursts when the x - ray luminosities can rise up to @xmath5 .",
    "galactic bh lmxbs are believed to evolve from primordial binaries consisting of a massive star and a low- or intermediate - mass companion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the standard formation scenario involves a common envelope ( ce ) phase , during which the binary s orbital separation reduces drastically due to the loss of the orbital kinetic energy @xcite , since the orbital separations of the present day binaries are orders - of - magnitude smaller than the radii that the massive primaries can reach during their evolution .",
    "when the primary star evolves and overflows its roche lobe , mass transfer proceeds on a dynamical timescale because the primary is much more massive than the secondary .",
    "the secondary can not accrete all the mass transferred onto it , and an envelope forms enshrouding the two stars .",
    "then the secondary star spirals into the envelope , and the orbital energy is used to expel the envelope ( for reviews of ce evolution , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if surviving the ce event , the binary can continue to evolve ; otherwise the two stars would merge to be a single star .",
    "though the ce stage is too short - lived to be detected , indirect observational evidence has emerged ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "bhs are thought to be the evolutionary outcomes of sufficiently massive stars ( @xmath6 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the envelope of such stars are generally too tightly bound for a low - mass secondary to expel @xcite , thus a merger is more likely to take place , unless the primary has lost a significant fraction of its envelope before the ce phase through stellar winds @xcite , or abnormally high values for the ce ejection efficiency are adopted @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario is that the secondaries in bh lmxbs are initially intermediate - mass stars , which can eject the primary s envelope more easily .",
    "observational evidence for this scenario comes from the cno - processed material in xte j1118@xmath7480 from its ultraviolet spectra @xcite .",
    "it is , however , difficult for an intermediate - mass x - ray binary ( imxb ) to evolve to short - period systems , unless some unusual angular momentum loss mechanisms are invoked ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "meanwhile , these binaries reveal a discrepancy between the calculated effective temperatures and the observed spectral types of the donor stars .",
    "the reason lies in that nuclear burning in the center of an intermediate - mass star causes a higher effective temperature than an ordinary low - mass star , though it has lost a significant fraction of its mass during the evolution @xcite .",
    "clues to the initial mass range for the donors in bh lmxbs can be derived from the spin evolution of the bhs , since the bh spins increase with accretion @xcite .",
    "two methods , i.e. , x - ray continuum - fitting @xcite and modeling relativistic reflection @xcite have been employed to estimate the spins of about 20 bhs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "assuming that bhs in lmxbs are born with negligible spins , @xcite showed that the initial masses of the secondaries in short - period binaries are generally @xmath8 .    from another point of view",
    ", approaches have been taken in the study of ce evolution by refining the energy budget for the ejection as well as the core - envelope binding energy .",
    "for example , @xcite argued that nuclear fusion should be added into the energy sources that may contribute to the envelope ejection .",
    "@xcite proposed that a thermonuclear runaway which is caused by the mixing hydrogen from the secondary into the helium - burning shell of the primary would assist the ejection . when treating the binding energy of the envelope , @xcite pointed out that there might be mass outflows during the slow spiral - in stage , when the orbital energy is balanced with the enthalpy rather than merely the internal energy of the envelope .",
    "that treatment can lower the binding energy by a factor of @xmath9 , and help allow for a low - mass companion to survive the ce phase .",
    "it is also noted that the value of the binding energy is sensitive to the definition of the boundary between the remnant core and the ejected envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite advocated that , the he core of a giant would experience a thermal readjustment stage after the ce event .",
    "thus the boundary between the remnant core and the ejected envelope can be determined as the place where the hydrogen burning shell had maximal compression prior to ce evolution .",
    "another issue in the formation of bh lmxbs is the mass range for the bh progenitors .",
    "current supernova ( sn ) theories can not reliably predict which stars form bhs instead of neutron stars ( nss ) , although they are generally thought to be more massive than @xmath10 .",
    "the bh masses in the 24 xrbs have been dynamically measured to be in the range of @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , there is statistical evidence for the presence of a dearth of nss or bhs with masses @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the traditional thought that the distribution of bh masses should decay with mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the physics of sn explosions that lead to the formation of bhs is still unclear @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite argued that zero - age main sequence stars with mass @xmath14 might experience an unsuccessful explosion and evolve to bhs , while stars with mass around @xmath15 experience a successful sn explosion and become nss .",
    "though this bifurcation is not well understood and may be related to the compactness parameter that describes the density profile outside the iron core @xcite , the failed sn mechanism can naturally account for the observed @xmath16 gap between nss and bhs .",
    "@xcite proposed that this mechanism can interpret the red supergiant problem and the sn rate problem , which concerns the absence of red supergiants with masses @xmath17 as the progenitors of type iip sne , and the deficit of the observed cosmic sn rate compared to the observed cosmic star formation rate , respectively .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the formation of galactic bh lmxbs incorporating the influence of the aforementioned factors with both stellar evolution and binary population synthesis ( bps ) methods . in section 2 ,",
    "we calculate and compare the binding energy parameters in various models , which are then used in our bps study . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the assumptions and prescriptions adopted in our bps calculations .",
    "the results in various kinds of models are presented and compared with observations in section 4 .",
    "we summarize the results and discuss their implications in section 5 .",
    "in the standard ce model the change in the binary s orbital energy @xmath18 is responsible for the ejection of the ce , which is described by the following equations @xcite , @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the binding energy of the envelope , @xmath22 the efficiency of converting the orbital energy to kinetic energy to eject the ce , @xmath23 the gravitational constant , @xmath24 the primary s mass and @xmath25 its core mass , @xmath26 the mass of the secondary , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 the orbital separations just before and after the ce phase , respectively .",

    "since the @xmath36 term is non - negative , the absolute value of @xmath21 becomes smaller in this case .    for convenience",
    ", @xcite introduced a parameter @xmath37 characterizing the central concentration of the donor s envelope to describe the binding energy : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mass of the donor star s envelope , and @xmath40 is the ratio of the roche lobe radius and the orbital separation at the onset of ce .",
    "generally , once a star fills its roche lobe , @xmath41 is taken to be the stellar radius .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ equation3])([equation6 ] ) , one can obtain different @xmath37s from the gravitational binding energy , the total energy and the enthalpy prescriptions , namely @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "we calculate their values using an updated version ( 7624 ) of the modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ) @xcite evolution code .",
    "we consider stars with initial masses in the range of @xmath45 , which securely covers the range of the stellar - mass bh progenitors ( more massive stars produce negligible bhs according to the initial mass function and will evolve to wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars with almost all the hydrogen envelopes lost due to strong stellar winds ) .",
    "the chemical composition of the stars is taken to be @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the mixing length parameter @xmath48 is set to be 2.0 . for massive stars",
    ", stellar winds may have non - ignorable influence on the @xmath37 parameter @xcite , but their loss rates have not been accurately determined . here , we adopt two prescriptions for the wind loss rate .",
    "the first one is taken from @xcite and @xcite for o and b stars in different stages , denoted as wind1 hereafter , while the other one , denoted as wind2 , adopts the maximum value of the prescriptions above in all the evolutionary stages , to be consistent with @xcite , and to set an upper limit for the influence of the stellar wind .",
    "the effect of stellar rotation is ignored , because in our calculation for lmxb formation , ce evolution usually occurs during case c mass transfer when the primary star has evolved to be a supergiant star with very slow rotation due to stellar evolution and/or tidal synchronization .",
    "our calculations show that the evolution of @xmath44 , @xmath43 , and @xmath42 generally have the similar trend in most of the evolutionary stages , i.e. , decreasing with increasing stellar radius .",
    "however , for stars less massive than @xmath49 , @xmath37s increase again when they have ascended the asymptotic giant branch and developed a deep envelope ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as an illustration , fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] shows different @xmath37 values as a function of the stellar radius @xmath50 for a @xmath51 star , and fig .",

    "[ figure1 ] the red , blue , and green lines describe the evolution of @xmath44 , @xmath43 , and @xmath42 respectively in each case .",
    "it is seen that the values of @xmath37 with the wind1 prescription are about three times as large as those with the wind2 prescription ( the binding energy with the wind1 prescription is half of the value with the wind2 prescription considering different envelope masses ) , indicating that the binding energy parameter for massive stars is sensitive to wind loss @xcite .",
    "we plot the core mass against the stellar radius in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , and list the stellar parameters along the evolutionary tracks in table  [ table1 ] in the two cases .",
    "we also use an updated stellar evolution code called ev originally developed by @xcite to calculate the values of @xmath37s , and find that they are several times smaller than those with the mesa code in the wind2 case ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the reason for this difference is that stars are generally more compact ( especially for stellar structure within the hydrogen burning shell ) during late evolution when modeled with the ev code .",
    "we choose to use the results with the mesa code in the following because it adopts much denser grids for stellar structure than the ev code .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a low - mass ( @xmath52 ) star is unable to eject the bh progenitor s envelope unless @xmath53 . in our calculation , this condition could be achieved for both @xmath44 and @xmath43 if the masses of the bh progenitors are @xmath54 .",
    "binaries with more massive progenitor stars are unable to survive ce evolution even if @xmath44 is adopted ( see also fig .  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "we use an updated version of the bps code developed by @xcite to study the formation of bh lmxbs .",
    "the code originates from the rapid single - star evolution code written by @xcite .",
    "it involves various kinds of processes such as mass transfer , accretion , ce evolution , sn kicks , tidal interactions , and angular momentum loss .",
    "we have made quite a few modifications of the bps code to follow the formation and evolution of xrbs @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe some considerations adopted in this work .      given the binding energy parameter @xmath37 , we can estimate the post - ce separation with the following equation : @xmath55 if neither the he core nor the secondary star fills its roche lobe , the binary is regarded to survive the ce phase and can continue to evolve .",
    "generally the value of @xmath22 is less than unity , and there is indication that the ce efficiency could be low @xcite .",
    "moreover , it may vary with stellar structure and the binary parameters .",
    "indeed , it has been suggested that @xmath22 may depend on the component mass and the orbital period in the studies of the formation of post - ce white dwarf binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is not known whether this can be applied to more massive binaries , so we still adopt constant values ( 1 and 0.2 ) for @xmath22 .",
    "it is noted that @xmath22 and @xmath37 are usually combined to affect ce evolution .      besides ce evolution , the sn explosions play an important role in the formation of bh lmxbs .",
    "the sn mechanisms are relevant to both the formation rate of xrbs and the mass distribution of the remnant bhs .",
    "when determining the bh masses @xmath56 , one needs to account for the measured masses of known bhs and the @xmath57 gap between the ns and bh masses without any fine - tuning of stellar mass loss .",
    "we consider both the prescriptions based on the neutrino - driven convection - enhanced sn mechanism , which is called the rapid sn mechanism , and the failed sn mechanism . in",
    "the former case the gravitational remnant mass is described by @xcite , @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the mass of the proto - compact object and @xmath60 with @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the co core mass , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "the latter prescription is under the assumption that the bh formation is controlled by the compactness of the stellar core at the time of collapse : low compactness stars are more likely to explode as sne and produce nss , while high - compactness stars are more likely to evolve to failed sne that produce bhs @xcite .",
    "in this case we assume @xmath65 or @xmath62 , where @xmath66 is the he core masses prior to core collapse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "first , the core mass @xmath67 at the end of the hertzsprung - gap is set according to the initial mass of the star ( see eq .  28 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . then the evolution of the core mass during the giant branch is determined by combining the power - law core mass - luminosity relation @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 depend on the stellar mass , and the energy conservation equation for hydrogen burning @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the envelope mass fraction of hydrogen and @xmath75 is the specific energy release .",

    "the kick velocity is set to be inversely proportional to the remnant mass , i.e. , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the kick velocity for nss , which follows a maxwellian distribution with @xmath84 @xcite .",

    "we then consider the alternative failed sn mechanism , and assume that the remnant bh mass equals the he or co core mass of the primary .",
    "this time we obtain more satisfactory results , with the distributions of the donor mass , temperature and orbital period for the current binaries largely consistent with observations .",
    "in particular , most bh lmxbs in this case originate from primordial binaries with incipient low - mass ( @xmath133 ) secondary stars , compatible with the requirement derived from the spin estimates of several bhs in lmxbs . finally , all models predict that most bh lmxbs are transient sources due to thermal instability in the accretion disks .",
    "thus , in the framework of the failed sn mechanism , it is possible to reproduce the galactic bh lmxbs with normal value of @xmath144 .",
    "realizing the uncertainties in the treatment of ce evolution , we also check the results by adopting a small @xmath118 in each case .",
    "our results demonstrate that , when @xmath122 is large enough for a low - mass star to survive the ce phase , the donor mass distribution is not sensitive to the choice of @xmath37 or @xmath22 , which affects the number and birthrate of the produced bh lmxbs .",
    "however , for very small @xmath122 , the donor mass distribution strongly depends on the value of @xmath37 or @xmath22 , because surviving the ce phase becomes paramount and difficult .",
    "in addition , the prescription of the bh mass with the he core mass leads to better match of the observations than with the co core mass .",
    "our results provide useful constraints on the formation process of bh lmxbs , but are subject to many uncertainties in both observational and theoretical aspects .",
    "when comparing the calculated results with observations , one needs to be cautious that this comparison is influenced by small number statistics as well as selection effects .",
    "currently there are around 20 dynamically confirmed stellar - mass bhs . it is not known whether they are correctly representative of the overall population in the galaxy .",
    "most bh lmxbs are transient sources , and we are lack of thorough understanding of their outburst characteristics ( including the peak luminosity and its relation with other parameters , and the duty cycles ) and the physical mechanisms @xcite . to make things more complicated , a new class of very faint x - ray transients were recently discovered with peak luminosities of only @xmath145 ergs@xmath80 @xcite . further more ,",
    "considering the selection effect that luminous sources are more likely to be observed , we may expect that a large fraction of the lmxbs possess even lower - mass donor stars than the current sample , because they are relatively dim in x - rays even during outbursts .",
    "there are also big uncertainties in modeling the evolutionary sequences of compact star binaries .",
    "we take into account @xmath146 in calculating the binding energy of the envelope ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but its credibility is controversial and there are arguments both for and against it in the literature , let alone the definition of the core - envelope boundary from which the binding energy is integrated ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion ) .",
    "it is also highly uncertain whether the ce efficiency @xmath22 is constant or depends on other physical parameters . @xcite and @xcite suggested that it may decrease with increasing mass ratio , but this effect has not been confirmed in modeling the sdss post - ce binary population ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and needs further verification .",
    "even if true , the physics behind it is not clear , and numerical simulations in 3d of ce evolution are eagerly required to resolve this issue . as to the sn and the bh formation mechanisms , our results base on the suggestion that stars of mass @xmath147 die in failed sne leaving a bh @xcite .",
    "the model still needs to be tested by both 3d numerical simulations of the collapse of massive stars and targeted field surveys for sne in nearby galaxies .",
    "obviously a thorough investigation on the evolutionary history of bh lmxbs needs to incorporate bps with the aforementioned input physics in a self - consistent way .",
