    "this article is a review of the main experimental applications of fluctuation theorems ( fts ) and summarizes the plenary talk given at statphys24 . in order to define the main contents",
    "let us consider several simple examples .",
    "the simplest and most basic out of equilibrium system is a thermal conductor whose extremities are connected to two heat baths at different temperatures , as sketched in fig.[fig : conduction ] .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics imposes that in average the heat flows from the hot to the cold reservoir ( from h to c in fig.[fig : conduction ] ) .",
    "however the second law does not say anything about fluctuations and in principle one can observe for a short time a heat current in the opposite direction . what is the probability of observing these rare events ? as a general rule when the size of the system decreases the role of fluctuations increases .",
    "thus from an experimental point of view it is reasonable to think that such rare events can be observed in systems that are small .",
    "a good candidate could be for example the thermal conduction in a nanotube whose extremities are connected to two heat baths @xcite , exactly in the spirit of fig.[fig : conduction ] . in reality in this kind of experiments the measure of the mean quantities @xcite is already difficult and of course the analysis of fluctuations is even more complicated .",
    "however there is an electrical analogy , shown in fig.[fig : conduction]b ) , of the thermal model of fig.[fig : conduction]a ) .",
    "let us consider an electrical conductor connected to a potential difference @xmath0 and kept at temperature @xmath1 by a heat bath .",
    "if the mean current @xmath2 ( @xmath3 being the electrical resistance of the conductor ) is of the order of @xmath4  a and the injected power is about @xmath5  j ( @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant ) then the instantaneous current inside the resistance has fluctuations whose amplitude is comparable to the mean , as shown in fig.[fig : conduction]c ) .",
    "the variance of these fluctuations is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the characteristic time constant of the electrical circuit . in the specific case of fig .",
    "[ fig : conduction]c ) the current reverses with respect to the mean value .",
    "the probability of having those negative currents have been studied both theoretically and experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite within the context of fluctuation theorems , that we will present in sec.[section_ft ] .     and @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "b ) electrical analogy .",
    "a conductor of electrical resistance @xmath3 and kept at a temperature @xmath1 is submitted to a potential difference @xmath11 .",
    "c ) instantaneous current @xmath12 flowing into the resistance using @xmath13  m@xmath14 , @xmath15  k and @xmath16  ms . [ fig : conduction ] ]    we discuss a second example where the source of fluctuation is not the coupling with a thermal bath , as in the case of the electrical conductor , but it is either a chaotic flows or a chaotic force produced by the non - linear interaction of many degrees of freedom of a dissipative system sustained by an external driving",
    ". we will refer to them as chaotic systems .",
    "let us consider a turbulent wind flowing around an object as sketched in fig.[fig : turbulence]a),b ) .",
    "the wind exerts a mean force @xmath17 on the object but the instantaneous force , plotted in fig.[fig : turbulence]c ) , is a strongly fluctuating quantity which presents negative values @xcite , i.e. the object moves against the wind , fig.[fig : turbulence]b ) .",
    "in such a case the mean work done by the wind on the object is about @xmath18  j@xmath19 and obviously thermal fluctuations do not play any role but so does the chaotic flow , which produces the fluctuations .",
    "other similar examples can be found for example in shaken granular media @xcite , discussed in sec.[section : dynamical_system ] .     ]",
    "these examples stress that in the two experiments the electrical conductor and the turbulent wind we may observe the counterintuitive effect that the instantaneous response of the system is opposite to the mean value , in other words the system has an instantaneous negative entropy production rate .",
    "this effect is induced by the thermal fluctuations in the first case and by the chaotic flow in the second case .",
    "the question that we want analyze in this article is whether the fluctuations theorem ( defined in section 3 ) is able to predict the probability of these rare events in both cases , i.e. for the stochastic and the chaotic systems .",
    "we will take an experimentalist approach and we will use experimental results in order to introduce the main concepts .",
    "the largest part of the article concerns stochastic systems described by a langevin dynamics . for chaotic systems we will mainly discuss the difficulty of comparing the experimental results with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the experimental results on the energy fluctuations measured in a harmonic oscillator driven out of equilibrium by an external force . in section 3 the experimental results on the harmonic oscillator",
    "are used to introduce the property of fluctuation theorems ( fts ) . in section 4 the non linear case of a brownian particle confined in a time dependent double well potential is presented . in section 5",
    "we introduce the applications of the ft , and as a more specific example we describe the measure of the torque of a molecular motor .",
    "finally in section 6 we discuss the chaotic systems and we conclude in section 7 .",
    "the choice of discussing the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator is dictated by the fact that it is relevant for many practical applications such as the measure of the elasticity of nanotubes@xcite , the dynamics of the tip of an afm @xcite , the mems and the thermal rheometer that we developed several years ago to study the rheology of complex fluids @xcite .",
    "this device is a very sensitive torsion pendulum as sketched in fig.[fig : pendulum]a ) .",
    "it is composed by a brass wire ( length @xmath20  @xmath21 , width @xmath22  @xmath21 , thickness @xmath23  @xmath24 ) and a glass mirror with a golden surface , fig.[fig : pendulum]c ) .",
    "the mirror ( length @xmath25  @xmath21 , width @xmath26  @xmath21 , thickness @xmath27  @xmath21 ) is glued in the middle of the brass wire .",
    "the elastic torsional stiffness of the wire is @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "it is enclosed in a cell , fig.[fig : pendulum]d ) , which is filled by a fluid .",
    "we used either air or a water - glycerol mixture at @xmath30 concentration .",
    "the system is a harmonic oscillator with resonant frequency @xmath31 and a relaxation time @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the total moment of inertia of the displaced masses ( _ i.e. _ the mirror and the mass of displaced fluid ) @xcite .",
    "the damping has two contributions : the viscous damping @xmath34 of the surrounding fluid and the viscoelasticity of the brass wire .",
    "the angular displacement of the pendulum @xmath35 is measured by a differential interferometer  @xcite which uses the two laser beams reflected by the mirror fig.[fig : pendulum]a ) .",
    "the measurement noise is two orders of magnitude smaller than thermal fluctuations of the pendulum .",
    "@xmath36 is acquired with a resolution of @xmath37 bits at a sampling rate of @xmath38  @xmath39 , which is about 40 times @xmath40 .",
    "we drive the system out - of - equilibrium by forcing it with an external torque @xmath41 by means of a small electric current @xmath42 flowing in a coil glued behind the mirror ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pendulum]b ) .",
    "the coil is inside a static magnetic field .",
    "the displacements of the coil and therefore the angular displacements of the mirror are much smaller than the spatial scale of inhomogeneity of the magnetic field .",
    "so the torque is proportional to the injected current : @xmath43 ; the slope @xmath44 depends on the geometry of the system .",
    "the practical realization of the montage is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pendulum]c ) ,  [ fig : pendulum]d ) . in equilibrium the variance @xmath45 of the thermal fluctuations of @xmath35 can be obtained from equipartition , i.e. @xmath46  nrad for our pendulum , where @xmath1 is the temperature of the surrounding fluid .",
    "the dynamics of the torsion pendulum can be assimilated to that of a harmonic oscillator damped by the viscoelasticity of the torsion wire and the viscosity of the surrounding fluid , whose equation of motion reads in the temporal domain @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the memory kernel and @xmath49 the thermal noise . in fourier space ( in the frequency range of our interest )",

    "the response function of the system @xmath59 can be measured by applying a torque with a white spectrum .",
    "when @xmath60 , the amplitude of the thermal vibrations of the oscillator is related to its response function via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) . therefore , the thermal fluctuation power spectral density ( psd ) of the torsion pendulum reads for positive frequencies @xmath61 ^ 2}.     \\label{fdt}\\ ] ] the brackets are ensemble averages . as an example , the spectrum of @xmath35 measured in the glycerol - water mixture is shown in fig.[fig : spectrum]a ) . in this case",
    "the resonance frequency is @xmath62  @xmath39 and the relaxation time @xmath63",
    "@xmath64 the measured spectrum is compared with that obtained from eq.[fdt ] using the measured @xmath56 .",
    "the viscoelastic component at low frequencies correspond to a constant @xmath65 . indeed if @xmath66 then from eq.[fdt ] @xmath67 as seen in fig.[fig : spectrum]a ) . instead if @xmath68 then for @xmath69 from eq.[fdt ] the spectrum is constant as a function of @xmath70 .",
    "it is important to stress that in the viscoelastic case the noise @xmath49 is correlated and the process is not markovian , whereas in the viscous case the process is markovian .",
    "thus by changing the quality of the fluid surrounding the pendulum one can tune the markovian nature of the process . in the following we will consider only the experiment in the glycerol - water mixture where the viscoelastic contribution is visible only at very low frequencies and is therefore negligible .",
    "this allows a more precise comparison with theoretical predictions often obtained for markovian processes .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath35 , plotted in fig.[fig : spectrum]b ) , is a gaussian .",
    "we now consider a periodic forcing of amplitude @xmath71 and frequency @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is a very common kind of forcing which has been already studied in the case of the first order langevin equation @xcite and of the two level system @xcite and in a different context for the second order langevin equation @xcite .",
    "furthermore this is a very general case because using fourier transform , any periodical forcing can be decomposed in a sum of sinusoidal forcing .",

    "the fact that @xmath318 and @xmath303 have the same dependence on the control parameter have been interpreted considering that the vibrator injects into the system the amount of energy lost in the collisions but once excited in a ness the granular medium behaves like a thermal bath for the measured observable .",
    "however this interpretation is not necessarily correct .",
    "indeed for the experiment of ref.@xcite it as been shown in a numerical simulation @xcite that for the quantity measured in this experiment ft does not apply for the large deviations @xmath115 because the symmetry function @xmath154 becomes non - linear for large @xmath115 .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and experiment is obviously coming from the fact that experimentally the very large deviation are difficult to be measured , thus the non - linear part of @xmath154 can not be observed .",
    "however the experiment of ref.@xcite is certainly interesting because is the first where the question of the prefactor has been analyzed experimentally .",
    "in contrast for the experiment of ref.@xcite is observed that @xmath319 where @xmath320 is the restitution coefficient of the grains .",
    "it is interesting to notice that @xmath321 is the temperature of an intruder inside a diluted granular gas as it has been found in theoretical models @xcite .",
    "these two examples of comparison between numerical and experimental results show the difficulty of interpreting the experimental results on ft and the importance of verifying them in a precise theoretical framework .",
    "where does the difference between the experiments of ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite come from ?",
    "the answer can be found on the fact that in the two experiments two different quantities are measured .",
    "indeed in sect.[section_ft ] we have seen that , even for stochastic systems , the fluctuations of @xmath82 , @xmath105 and @xmath213 behave differently within the context of ft .",
    "this can be more complex for granular media and it will be useful to give more insight on this point .",
    "furthermore even in cases where a description in terms of @xmath322 applies , comparing eq.[ft_granular ] with eq.[ft_dynamical ] a question that arises naturally is whether @xmath323 is a good estimation of @xmath324 .",
    "this is an important question which will be interesting to analyze in the future .      in the experiment on mechanical waves@xcite",
    ", a metallic plate is set into a chaotic state of wave turbulence by a periodic local forcing at @xmath325  hz .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cadot]a ) .",
    "the chaotic dynamics is produced by the non - linear interaction of the oscillatory modes of the plate .",
    "the authors measure the local force and displacement ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cadot]a ) and compute the work @xmath82 done on a time @xmath102 by the external force which excites the vibrations of the plate .",
    "they find that the pdfs of @xmath313 are strongly non - gaussian ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cadot]b ) . from these pdfs",
    "they compute the symmetry function @xmath326 which is plotted ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cadot]c ) as a function of @xmath115 .",
    "we see that in spite of the fact that the pdf are not gaussian the function @xmath326 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cadot]c ) converges to a unique straight line for large @xmath102 as predicted by ft . from eq.[ft_dynamical ] the slope of this straight line is @xmath310 , which the authors can estimate independently by measuring the relaxation time of the vibrational modes .",
    "they find that the values estimated with the two methods ( ft and the relaxation time ) are very close and within experimental errors .",
    "this result is quite interesting and it is probably the only experiment where a direct test of eq.[ft_dynamical ] has been done .",
    "certainly the errors of this comparison are very large but this kind of tests are useful to understand in some details the applications of fts to chaotic systems .     for @xmath327 )",
    "( c ) functions @xmath315 obtained from the pdfs of ( b ) .",
    "inset : compensated value @xmath328 in a semi log plot . in ( c )",
    "the dashed line corresponds to a linear law of slope @xmath329 . ]",
    "in this paper we have reviewed several experimental results on the fluctuations of injected and dissipated power in out of equilibrium systems .",
    "we considered the two cases when the fluctuations are produced by the coupling with the heat bath ( stochastic systems ) and when they are produced by the non linear interactions of many degrees of freedom ( chaotic systems ) .",
    "we have seen that in both cases we observe that the external forces may produce a negative work because of fluctuations .",
    "the probability of these negative events has been analyzed in the framework of fluctuation theorem .",
    "we have mainly discussed the stochastic systems described by langevin equations , both with harmonic and unharmonic potential .",
    "we have seen that injected and dissipated power present different behaviors .",
    "fts are valid for any value of @xmath82 whereas can be applied only for @xmath330 in the case of the heat .",
    "we have also seen the the finite time corrections to ssft depend on the driving and on the properties of the system .",
    "we have introduced the total entropy , which takes into account only the entropy produced by the external forces neglecting the the equilibrium fluctuations . for the total entropy fts are valid for all the times .",
    "we discussed the applications of fts to extract important physical properties of a stochastic system .",
    "thus one may conclude that for markovian systems driven by a deterministic force the applications of ft does not present any major problems and can be safely applied .",
    "the case of random driving has been recently discussed and several problems may arise when the variance of the driving become larger than the fluctuations induced by the thermal bath .",
    "we have not discussed this problem but an analysis of this specific case can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "finally we discussed the applications of ft to chaotic systems .",
    "the experimental test is in this case very important and useful because many questions can be asked on the system under study which does not necessarily verify all the theoretical hypothesis .",
    "one has to say that in the case of non - gaussian statistics even the linearity of the symmetry function can be an interesting result .",
    "however we pointed out that , for a real comparison with theory , the difficulty is to estimate of the prefactor of eq.[ft_dynamical ] by an independent measurement .",
    "only a few experiments have addressed this point in some details , but many problems remain open and it seems to be difficult to find a general behavior for chaotic systems as for the case of stochastic ones .",
