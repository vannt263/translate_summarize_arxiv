    "it has been known for a long time that the classical two - integral equilibrium theory in axisymmetric geometry is not sufficient to adequately describe the stellar discs of galaxies . in accordance with jeans theorem ( jeans 1915 )",
    ", the phase space distribution function of a stellar system in a steady state depends only on the isolating integrals of the motion ; the binding energy @xmath0 and the vertical component of the angular momentum @xmath1 are isolating integrals in a stationary and axisymmetric system .",
    "it is a fundamental property of all two - integral distribution functions @xmath2 that the dispersion of the velocity in the radial direction equals the dispersion in the vertical direction : we know that , for example , the disc of the milky way does not have that property  ( binney & merrifield 1998 ) .",
    "illustrations of other shortcomings of a two - integral model in a galactic context can be found in durand , dejonghe & acker  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the introduction of a third integral of the motion helps to overcome these constraints : in that case , the velocity dispersions can be different in all the directions .",
    "numerical experiments show that a third isolating integral seems to exist for most orbits in realistic galactic potentials  ( ollongren 1962 , innanen & papp 1977 , richstone 1982 ) .",
    "this third integral can be taken into account numerically in the models by using extensions of schwarzschild s  ( 1979 ) orbit superposition technique  ( cretton et al .",
    "1999 , zhao 1999 , hfner et al .",
    "it is also possible to define an analytic third integral specific to particular orbital families  ( de zeeuw , evans & schwarzschild 1996 , evans , hfner & de zeeuw 1997 ) or an approximate global third integral  ( petrou 1983ab , dehnen & gerhard 1993 ) , but we choose to construct models with an exact analytic third integral by using a stckel potential  ( stckel 1890 , de zeeuw 1985 ) .",
    "it is not quite obvious to define suitable global distribution functions @xmath3 that depend on three exact analytic integrals and that can somewhat realistically represent our ideas of a real stellar disc .",
    "for example , bienaym  ( 1999 ) made three - integral extensions of the two - integral parametric distribution functions described in bienaym & schaud  ( 1997 ) , but these ones were built to model the kinematics of neighbouring stars in the milky way only .",
    "dejonghe & laurent  ( 1991 ) also defined the three - integral abel distribution functions , but these ones could not provide very thin discs in the two - integral approximation .",
    "robijn & de zeeuw  ( 1996 ) constructed three - integral distribution functions for oblate galaxy models , but they also had problems to recover the two - integral approximation .    in this paper",
    "we continue the work of batsleer & dejonghe  ( 1995 ) , who constructed component distribution functions that are two - integral , but that can represent ( very ) thin discs when a judicious linear combination of them is chosen .",
    "we use these components as a basis for new component distribution functions that are three - integral , of which the batsleer & dejonghe components are a special case .    in the next section",
    ", we outline some fundamentals of two - integral equilibrium systems and we show how to model discs with a finite extent in the vertical direction . in section 3 , we present some general facts about stckel potentials and we present new analytic three - integral distribution functions that can represent stellar discs .",
    "an analytical expression for the moments of these distribution functions is calculated in section 4 . in the next section",
    ", we discuss their physical properties and show their realistic disc - like character . finally ,",
    "in section 6 , we show that these distribution functions can be used as basis functions in the modeling of a van der kruit disc . for the conclusions ,",

    "we denote the gravitational potential in cylindrical coordinates @xmath4 by @xmath5 . the two classical isolating integrals of the motion are the binding energy , @xmath6 , and the @xmath7-component of the angular momentum , @xmath8 .",
    "when we use the term orbit , we do not consider the information contained in the phases of the orbital motion : an orbit is thus shorthand for an orbital density .",

    "as mentioned before , we intend to create three - integral stellar distribution functions , for the construction of stellar discs : we want to achieve an exponential decline in the mass density for large radii , while we want to introduce a preference for ( almost ) circular orbits .",
    "it has been known for some time that two - integral models can describe very thin disc systems , with the restriction that both vertical and radial dispersions are equal  ( jarvis & freeman 1985 ) .",
    "so we want to create three - integral distribution functions that can describe very thin discs in the two - integral approximation , unlike the abel distribution functions  ( dejonghe & laurent 1991 ) .    the fricke components  ( fricke 1952 ) @xmath45 favour that part of phase space where stars populate circular orbits , so they could be taken as a starting point",
    "however , they can not be used in their basic form to model discs with a finite extent because they populate orbits which can reach arbitrary large heights : therefore , we will take as a starting point the components defined in batsleer & dejonghe  ( 1995 , eq . 19 ) .    in order to make the components depending on the third integral @xmath46",

    "furthermore , if we want to favour ( almost ) circular orbits , we have to suppose the distribution function to be an increasing function of @xmath0 : this forces @xmath51 to be positive .",
    "since a large @xmath46 implies that the orbit can reach a large height above the galactic plane  ( see de zeeuw 1985 for a complete analysis of the orbits in a stckel potential ) , the orbits with small @xmath46 s have to be favoured in order to describe thin discs : this forces @xmath48 to be negative .",
    "other constraints ( on @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath48 and @xmath63 ) will be imposed in section 4 , in order to enable the analytical calculations of the moments .",
    "the moments of a distribution function @xmath58 at the point @xmath33 of a spheroidal coordinate system are defined as @xmath64 with @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 the components of the velocity in the @xmath34 , the @xmath11 and the @xmath35 direction of the spheroidal coordinate system , and @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 integers .    the mass density , the mean velocity and the velocity dispersions of the stellar system represented by @xmath58 can easily be expressed in terms of the moments ( [ defmoments ] ) by @xmath71    to obtain the value of one of these moments , we have to integrate over the volume in velocity - space corresponding to all orbits that pass through the point @xmath33 .",

    "in this section , we show the realistic disc - like character of our stellar distribution functions : their mass density has a finite extent in the vertical direction and an exponential decline in the galactic plane , they favour almost circular orbits and their velocity dispersions are different in the vertical and radial direction . by varying the parameters",
    ", we can give a wide range of shapes to the components .    in order to illustrate the role of the different parameters , we calculate the moments of many component distribution functions with different values for the parameters .",
    "as galactic potential , we use one of the stckel potentials described by famaey & dejonghe  ( 2001 ) , that are extensions of the ones described by batsleer & dejonghe  ( 1994 ) . in the implementation of the theory",
    "we choose @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath126 .",
    "this parameter was introduced in order to impose a maximum height above the galactic plane for the disc - like component ( figure [ fig : parz0 ] ) : indeed , when @xmath127 , an orbit can not go higher than @xmath16 , and the distribution function ( [ eq:3icomp ] ) is null for @xmath128 . in order to model samples of stars belonging to populations with different characteristic heights above the galactic plane",

    "the parameter @xmath62 enters eq .",
    "( 10 ) as the exponent of @xmath26 : so , for non - negative values of @xmath62 , the factor where it appears will behave as a declining function of @xmath1 , in the same way as @xmath117 does , showing a steeper decline for larger @xmath62 ( see figure [ fig : a1 ] ) .",
    "a large @xmath62 thus results in a distribution function that favours a large fraction of bound orbits .",
    "when it is increasing , this parameter helps to produce mass close to the center .",
    "when a given exponential decline is requested , @xmath62 will be a function of the other parameters rather than a fixed parameter ( see section 5.3 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 occurs as exponent in the distribution function s exponential factor .",
    "increasing values of this parameter will contribute to the mass distribution near the center ( figure [ fig : a2 ] ) , like in the @xmath62 case ( but exponentially ) .",
    "on the other hand , our potential is approximately keplerian at very large radii : this implies that , in the galactic plane , @xmath129 and that ( batsleer & dejonghe 1995 ) @xmath130    so , at very large radii , @xmath61 is the reciprocal of the component s scale length , if the contribution of the other factors to the mass density does not vary much with respect to @xmath17 ( for very large @xmath17 ) . in practice , it is often desirable to use components for which an exponential decline and a given scale length ( as determined by @xmath61 ) is already built - in between two radii ( say @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) . in such cases ,",
    "the parameter @xmath62 is adjusted in such a way that it corrects for the non - constant behaviour of the other factors at large radii , making the global contribution of all factors ( except the one in @xmath61 ) constant at @xmath131 and @xmath132 .      for this parameter , there are two distinct cases : @xmath134 and @xmath135 . in the first case ,",
    "the density is maximum in the center and falls off smoothly . in the latter case ,",
    "the density is null in the center since @xmath136 for @xmath137 . in order to model real stellar systems , we need components with @xmath134 to have some mass in the center .",
    "however , in a real galaxy , the maximum number of stars occurs in the intermediate region where the bulge meets the disc : this justifies the utilization of components with @xmath135 when modelling real stellar systems .",
    "we see the maximum density moving away from the center when @xmath133 is rising ( figure [ fig : parb ] ) .",
    "we also see on figure ( [ fig : parb ] ) that an increasing @xmath133 will concentrate the mass in a smaller region of configuration space .",
    "[ fig : parg ]    for a given @xmath1 , the largest value of the factor @xmath138 is obtained when the binding energy @xmath139 corresponds to the circular orbits in the galactic plane ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "so , the parameter @xmath63 is responsible for the favouring of almost circular orbits : a larger @xmath63 implies a larger contribution of almost circular orbits ( figure [ fig : parg ] ) and thus a mass density located closer to the plane .",
    "condition ( [ eq : cond ] ) @xmath140 implies that for @xmath141 and a strictly negative @xmath48 , the orbits can not reach the height @xmath23 above the galactic plane .",
    "we see on figure ( [ fig : pars ] ) that the height @xmath23 is reached only in the case @xmath142 . furthermore , since a large @xmath46 corresponds to an orbit that can reach a large height , the factor @xmath143 favours orbits that stay low .",
    "so , by setting @xmath48 more negative , we confine the orbits closer to the galactic plane .",
    "a very important property of our components is the possibility of introducing a certain amount of anisotropy in the stellar disc : if we denote by @xmath144 the dispersion of the velocity in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane , and by @xmath145 the dispersion of the radial velocity in the galactic plane , then any nonzero @xmath48 will produce a ratio @xmath146 less than 1 ( figure [ fig : dispratio ] ) .",
    "the ratio is closer to unity in the center than in the outer regions : this indicates the physically realistic character of our components . for @xmath142 , we find @xmath147 since we are dealing with a two - integral component again .",
    "a large @xmath49 has partly the same effects as a large @xmath63 : it favours circular orbits .",
    "furthermore , a large @xmath49 augments the effects of the negative @xmath48 and forces the stars to stay close to the plane by favouring low @xmath46-values . as we can see on figure ( [ fig : pard ] ) , a component with a larger @xmath49 has more stars in the galactic plane but shows a steeper decline with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "the component distribution functions described in this paper are very useful as basis functions in the method described by dejonghe  ( 1989 ) , in order to model any observable quantities ( spatial mass density , velocity dispersions , average radial velocities on a sky grid , ... ) . as an illustration , we present the application of the method to fit a given spatial density @xmath148 ( see batsleer & dejonghe 1995 for a similar application in the two - integral approximation ) .",
    "we look for a linear combination of our components @xmath149 that fits @xmath148 , with @xmath150 and @xmath151 the coefficients that are to be determined .    in practice , to find this linear combination we must introduce a grid @xmath152 in configuration space and minimize the quadratic function in @xmath153 : @xmath154 ^ 2 \\label{eq : chi2}\\ ] ] this minimization , together with the constraint that the distribution function must be positive in phase space , is a problem of quadratic programming ( hereafter qp ) described by dejonghe  ( 1989 ) .    here , we choose to adopt for @xmath155 a spatial density which closely resembles that of a real disc , i.e. a van der kruit law , for which the vertical disribution is a good compromise between an exponential and an isothermal sheet  ( van der kruit 1988 ) .",
    "@xmath156 in order to have a zero derivative with respect to @xmath17 on the rotation axis , we adopt a mass density that follows closely the van der kruit law , without a cusp in the center ( see also batsleer & dejonghe  1995 ) :    @xmath157    with @xmath158 and @xmath159 denoting the horizontal and vertical scale factor , respectively .",
    "since the moments @xmath160 are dependent on the potential of the galaxy ( including the dark matter ) , we have to choose a potential for the galaxy that contains the stellar disc we want to model .",
    "we adopt a stckel potential with three mass components that produces a flat rotation curve and that therefore is a candidate potential for a disc galaxy ( famaey & dejonghe 2001 , see also batsleer & dejonghe 1994 ) .",
    "the actual modelling follows the same strategy as followed by batsleer & dejonghe  ( 1995 ) , which we briefly repeat here for easy reference .",
    "the first step in the actual modelling consists in the selection of a subset of components out of the ( infinite ) set of possible components .",
    "this subset is chosen so that certain features , that we suppose to be present in the stellar disc , such as circular orbits , are included .",
    "for example , we expect the mass density corresponding to a component to have an exponential behaviour close to the mass density we want to model .",
    "the qp program first minimizes the function ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) for one component @xmath161 and chooses the component of the initial subset that produces the lowest minimum for that function ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) . then the program iterates , selecting and adding at each iteration the component which , together with the components already chosen in a previous run , produces the best fit .",
    "once the minimum of the @xmath162-variable does not change significantly any more with the addition of extra components , the program is halted because too low a value for @xmath162 could imply that the qp program starts producing a distribution function featuring unnecessary oscillations .    as an example",
    ", we model a modified van der kruit disc with @xmath163kpc and @xmath164kpc .",
    "batsleer & dejonghe  ( 1995 ) already showed that a linear combination of two - integral components ( with @xmath142 and @xmath165 ) could fit such a disc , but with @xmath166 . in order to model real anisotropic velocity data in the future",
    ", the dependence on the third integral will be needed .",
    "we show that , by choosing components with @xmath167 ; @xmath168 ; @xmath169 ; @xmath170 ; @xmath171 ; @xmath172 ; @xmath173 and @xmath59 in the initial subset , a fit with components featuring @xmath174 and @xmath175 can be obtained too ( see figure 12 ) .",
    "the fit is obtained for a linear combination of @xmath176 components at @xmath177 configuration space points ( @xmath178 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "if we assume relative errors of @xmath179 , we obtain for our minimum @xmath180 , and the probability that a value of @xmath162 larger than @xmath181 should occur by chance is @xmath182  ( abramowitz & stegun 1972 ) , which makes the goodness - of - fit believable  ( press et al . 1986 ) .    by using stckel dynamics to model a galactic disc ,",
    "we construct a completely explicit and analytic distribution function , with an explicit dependence on the third integral .",
    "figure ( 13 ) displays the distribution function obtained by qp in function of @xmath0 , for @xmath183 and for two values of @xmath46 ( @xmath184 and @xmath185 ) . for @xmath184 , the distribution function is non - zero if @xmath186 ( with @xmath187kpc ) ; for @xmath188 , instead , the maximum value of @xmath0 is the one corresponding to infinitesimally thin short axis tubes and is smaller than @xmath189 .",
    "we see on figure ( 13 ) that the distribution function is decreasing with increasing @xmath46 ( particularly near @xmath190 ) , and that it has some clumps .",
    "these clumps at @xmath185 are not discontinuities since the distribution function is a linear combination of continuous components .",
    "many different three - integral distribution functions correspond to a given spatial density , and there is no guarantee that they will yield realistic velocity dispersions .",
    "it is a major result of this paper to show that it is possible to find a linear combination of our components yielding realistic velocity dispersions .",
    "figure ( 14 ) displays the ratio @xmath146 in the galactic plane : at the radius corresponding to the solar position in the milky way ( @xmath191-@xmath192 kpc ) , the classical value of @xmath193 is obtained .",
    "the local maximum in the @xmath146 curve is due to the individual shapes of the velocity dispersions curves ( figure 14 ) .",
    "in this paper , we have constructed new analytic three - integral stellar distribution functions yielding @xmath194 : they are generalizations of two - integral ones that can describe thin discs with the restriction that @xmath195  ( batsleer & dejonghe 1995 ) .",
    "we first reduced the triple integral defining their moments to a simple one , like in the abel case  ( dejonghe & laurent 1991 ) , by making some assumptions on the parameters .",
    "then we looked for the effects of the different parameters and showed the disc - like ( physically realistic ) features of our distribution functions : they have a finite extent in vertical direction and an exponential decline in the galactic plane , while favouring almost circular orbits .",
    "a very important feature induced by the dependence on the third integral is their ability to introduce a certain amount of anisotropy , by varying the parameters responsible for this dependence ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "we finally showed that a van der kruit disc can be modelled by a linear combination of such distribution functions with an explicit dependence on the third integral and a realistic anisotropy in velocity dispersions .",
    "this implies that they are very promising tools to model real data with @xmath194 ( hipparcos data for example ) by using the quadratic programming algorithm described by dejonghe  ( 1989 ) .",
    "this will provide information on the dynamical state of tracer stars in the milky way ( or on external galaxies ) .",
    "we thank dr alain jorissen very much for his permanent assistance .",
    "we thank the referee dr stephen levine for his thorough reading of the manuscript and many helpful suggestions .",
