    "inflation , a quasi - exponential expansion of the very early universe , is the most commonly adopted and successful model to explain the problems such as horizon , flatness and monopole @xcite .",
    "a most charming feature of the inflation is that it can predict the generation of a nearly flat spectrum of primordial perturbations , which fit the observations of cosmological microwave background ( cmb ) exactly .",
    "such perturbations naturally arise from vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields in standard inflation @xcite or thermal fluctuations in warm inflation @xcite .",
    "there are two candidates of inflation so far - standard ( also named cold inflation ) and warm inflation as we just mentioned .",
    "they share the advantages such as successfully solving the horizon and flatness problem and naturally producing seed to give rise to the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "in addition , warm inflation has some improved character compared to standard inflation .",
    "for example , the constant production of radiation through the interaction between inflaton and other sub - dominated fields can lead the universe go into radiation dominated phase smoothly . and warm inflation can also cure the ` eta problem ' @xcite and the overlarge amplitude of the inflaton suffered in standard inflation @xcite .",
    "the inflaton in warm inflation is not isolated as in cold inflation , so the evolution equation of inflaton is modified by an additional thermal damped term adding to it due to its interactions with other fields .",
    "so in warm inflation the damped effect is stronger and the slow - roll conditions are much more easily to be realized @xcite .",
    "the inflaton usually used in standard inflation can be divided into two kinds : canonical and noncanonical scalar fields .",
    "canonical field is the most commonly used one in inflationary scenario with the lagrangian density @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the kinetic term and @xmath3 is the potential of inflaton .",
    "however , noncanonical field with a general form of lagrangian density @xmath4 can generalize the scope of inflation , where @xmath5 is an arbitrary function of the inflaton @xmath6 and the kinetic term @xmath7 that satisfied the conditions proposed in @xcite .",
    "much work have been done in the context of the noncanonical standard inflation @xcite and a lot of novel phenomena have been revealed , such as the less restricted slow - roll conditions , the usual sub - light ` sound speed ' ( denotes as @xmath8 ) for inflaton scalar perturbations , the modified expression of power spectrum and consistency equation , and in particular significant non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , the warm inflation is always dealt with the canonical fields except in @xcite where a warm dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) inflationary model was proposed .",
    "since the warm inflation and the noncanonical standard inflation both have some differentiable and good novel features , it s meaningful and interesting to combine them .",
    "we extend the warm inflation from canonical fields to a general noncanonical fields in @xcite and build a new and broader picture of inflation . with stronger hubble damping term and thermal damping term , stability analysis gave the even less restricted slow - roll conditions and a new but still scale - invariant power spectrum was obtained @xcite . the energy scale of inflation when hubble horizon crossing , the production of gravitational wave and consistency equation all acquire modification from both noncanonical effect and thermal effect .",
    "the non - gaussianity generated in the new picture hasnt been fully researched and it s the main task of our paper .",
    "although the inflation is a successful and elegant picture to explain the problem of horizon , flatness and large scale structure of the universe etc , there still exists a degeneracy problem @xcite , i.e. a single set of observables maps to a range of different inflaton models ( canonical and noncanonical fields with different potentials ) .",
    "even a precise measurement of the spectral index , the running of spectral index , and the detection of gravitational wave will not allow us efficiently discriminate among them .",
    "there is another observable - non - gaussianity can provide more information about the mechanism chosen by nature .",
    "non - gaussianity , as the name implies , is the deviation from a gaussian statistics and the presence of higher - order correlation functions , such as the bispectrum @xcite and the trispectrum @xcite .",
    "the primordial curvature perturbation in slow - roll inflationary scenario is almost gaussian with an almost scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "research on the issue of non - gaussianity in standard inflation has been done a lot in both canonical theory @xcite and noncanonical theory @xcite . the non - gaussianities in multi - field inflation were calculated using @xmath9-formalism in some papers @xcite .",
    "the single - field slow - roll inflation model itself produces negligible non - gaussianity , and in noncanonical or multi - field inflationary models , the non - gaussianity can be significant .",
    "non - gaussianity was considered in different approach in @xcite in both strong and weak regime of canonical warm inflation .",
    "our paper concentrates on the issue of non - gaussianity in noncanonical warm inflation and make some comparisons between the new model and other inflationary models .",
    "the calculations about non - gaussianity in kinds of models are almost all results of the first - order cosmological perturbation theory , and the analysis of the second - order cosmological perturbation theory is really complicated .",
    "non - gaussianity is often characterized by a nonlinear parameter @xmath0 .",
    "some calculations in the context of the second - order perturbation theory were done @xcite and yield @xmath10 regardless of the inflationary models .",
    "we ll also compare our result with the general second - order theory result .",
    "the new observations of planck find no evidence for primordial non - gausssianity for usual shapes ( such as local , equilateral and orthogonal shapes ) @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the new noncanonical warm inflationary scenario and review the basic equations of the new picture . then in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we get the evolution equations for the first- and second - order scalar field perturbations .",
    "then the nonlinear parameter @xmath0 which can describe the non - gaussian signatures in the new scenario is obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] and the special dbi warm inflationary example is discussed .",
    "finally , we draw the conclusions in sec .",
    "warm inflation occurs when there is a significant amount of radiation production during the inflationary epoch and the universe is hot with a non - zero temperature @xmath11 . in noncanonical warm inflationary case ,",
    "the total matter action of the multi - component universe is @xmath12,\\ ] ] where the lagrangian density of the noncanonical field is @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the lagrangian density of radiation fields and @xmath15 denotes the interaction between the scalar fields .",
    "usually the noncanonical lagrangian should satisfy the conditions : @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite , where a subscript @xmath7 denotes a derivative .",
    "the energy density and pressure of the noncanonical field are : @xmath18 , @xmath19 . in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , the field is homogeneous , and we can get the equation of motion of the scalar field through varying the action .",
    "we consider the case that the lagrangian density has a separable general form kinetic term and a potential term as in @xcite , i.e. @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the noncanonical kinetic term which is weakly dependent or independent on @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "then the equation of motion of the noncanonical scalar field during warm inflation can be derived under some calculations @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the dissipative coefficient due to thermal dissipation effect in warm inflation , @xmath24 is the ` sound speed ' which describes the traveling speed of scalar perturbations , @xmath25 is the hubble parameter and @xmath26 denotes the effective potential ( the subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 both denote a derivative and for simplicity we ll write @xmath26 as @xmath3 hereinafter ) .",
    "the interaction between the inflaton and other fields leads to thermal damping effect of inflaton and energy transfer to radiation @xcite , which can be characterized by the entropy production equation : @xmath27 the number of e - folds is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dissipation strength that parameterizes the efficiency of warm inflation ( @xmath30 denotes strong warm inflation and @xmath31 denotes weak warm inflation ) .    inflation is often associated with slow - roll approximation to drop the highest derivative terms in the equations of motion , the same in the new picture : @xmath32 @xmath33 the validity of slow - roll approximation depends on slow - roll conditions characterized by slow - roll parameters defined as : @xmath34 and two parameters about the temperature dependence : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the reduced squared planck mass .",
    "the slow - roll assumptions can be more easily to be guaranteed when @xmath37 in noncanonical warm inflationary scenario @xcite , which makes the analysis of the new model maneuverable .",
    "thermal fluctuations dominate over quantum fluctuations in warm inflation and thermal noise is introduced in the evolution of the perturbations .",
    "thermal fluctuations in radiation are coupled to the inflaton as a consequence of the damping term in the inflaton evolution equation , and their amplitude is fixed by a fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "this means that both entropy and curvature perturbations must be present .",
    "fortunately on large scales only the pure curvature perturbation survives @xcite . and",
    "primordial cosmological perturbations are usually expressed in terms of the curvature perturbation on uniform energy density hypersurfaces , denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "the quantity is widely used because it s conserved on large scales in simple models , even beyond linear order perturbation theory @xcite . in order to treat the fluctuations of the primordial curvature perturbation , we utilize the similar stochastic approach which has been used in strong and weak warm inflation @xcite . in the linear order perturbation theory for the slow - roll single field inflation ( noncanonical warm inflation",
    "is dominated by one single noncanonical inflaton field in overdamped slow - roll regime ) , the curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurfaces is given by a gauge - invariant linear combination : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is spatial metric perturbation and @xmath41 is perturbations about homogeneous inflaton fields .",
    "for convenience , we calculate in the commonly used spatially flat gauge ( where @xmath42 ) . considering the perturbations",
    ", we expand the full inflaton field as @xmath43 , with @xmath44 being the homogeneous background field and @xmath45 .",
    "the behaviour of a scalar field interacting with radiation can be analysed using the schwinger - keldysh approach to non - equilibrium field theory @xcite . and",
    "the evolution equation of the full inflaton field coupled to radiation is described by a langevin equation @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the thermal stochastic noise in thermal system with zero mean @xmath48 . in the high temperature limit @xmath49 ,",

    "we can see from eq .",
    "( [ solution1 ] ) that the larger squared magnitude of the physical momentum @xmath72 is , the faster the relaxation rate is . if @xmath72 is sufficiently large for the mode to relax within a hubble time , then that mode thermalizes .",
    "while as soon as the physical momentum of a @xmath73 field mode becomes less than @xmath74 , it essentially feels no effect of the thermal noise @xmath75 during a hubble time @xcite . to quantify this criterion ,",
    "the freeze - out momentum @xmath74 is defined by the condition @xmath76 that the mass term can be negligible is guaranteed by the slow - roll conditions and we can work out the freeze - out momentum @xmath77 .",
    "we can see that for strong regime of warm inflation , the fluctuations freeze in well before horizon exit , while in weak regime of warm inflation or the case that noncanonical effect dominate over thermal effect , fluctuations freeze in almost when horizon crossing .",
    "for a perfect gaussian distribution quantity , the two - point correlation function ( or power spectrum as its fourier transform ) is all that is needed in order to completely characterize it from a statistical view and all the connected corrections higher than two - point vanish .",
    "if the distribution has some departure from perfect gaussian one , then the higher - order correlation functions appear .",
    "the lowest - order statistics that is able to distinguish non - gaussian from gaussian perturbations is the three - point correlation function ( or bispectrum ) . we know that the first - order inflaton perturbations @xmath61 are gaussian fields and their bispectrum must vanish .",
    "so the leading order of the non - gaussianity of the fluctuations is the bispectrum generated from two first - order and one second - order fluctuations as    @xmath78+a(k_3,t ) \\langle\\delta\\phi_1(\\mathbf{k}_1,t)\\delta\\phi_1(\\mathbf{k_2},t)\\delta\\phi_2 ( \\mathbf{k}_3e^{-h(t - t_0)},t_0)\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\&+&(\\mathbf{k}_1\\leftrightarrow\\mathbf{k}_3)+(\\mathbf{k}_2\\leftrightarrow\\mathbf{k}_3).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the amplitude and slope of the bispectrum are determined at the time when cosmological scale exiting the horizon , nearly 60 e - folds before the end of inflation and for @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 all within a few e - folds of crossing the horizon .",
    "the parameter @xmath82 in the expression above is slowly varying so it can be approximated as a constant .",
    "when evaluating the three - point correlation function , the parameter @xmath83 is weakly dependent on @xmath84 and can have the approximation @xmath85 in the small time interval as stated in @xcite .",
    "since we have @xmath86 in noncanonical warm inflationary model , it implies the @xmath41 correlations that must be computed at time of hubble horizon crossing @xmath87 , are the thermalized correlations that were fixed at freeze - out time @xmath88 @xcite .",

    "the bispectrum of curvature perturbation @xmath38 is defined as @xmath91 in spatially flat gauge we have the relation : @xmath92 and since the inflaton fluctuation distributions are gaussian dominating , the curvature perturbations are also gaussian term dominating . for that case , the bispectrum can have the general form @xmath93,\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the non - linear parameter that often used to describe the non - gaussian signatures . through the eqs .",

    "the non - gaussianity described by the non - linear parameter in strong regime of canonical warm inflation @xcite has the same order as in standard inflation @xcite .",

    "the situation in our new case is more complicated for the dependence of more parameters . from the expression of eq .",

    "the stronger the noncanonical effect is , the more the departure from gaussianity is .",
    "the above analysis are results in the context of first - order cosmological perturbation theory , and there is a contribution that comes from the evolution of the ubiquitous second - order cosmological perturbation after inflation .",
    "the second - order perturbation evolution is model independent and introduce a contribution @xmath10 .",
    "so in the limit of low ` sound speed ' , the first - order result is dominated while in the canonical standard inflationary case the first - order contribution is negligible and overwhelmed by the second - order one .",
    "however , the new observations of planck satellite suggest no evidence for primordial non - gaussianity @xcite and place a upper bound @xmath100 , so the ` sound speed ' should not be too small .",
