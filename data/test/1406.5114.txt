    "the harmonic oscillator potential for relativistic spin 1/2 was first introduced by ito et al .",
    "@xcite and has attracted considerable interest in the last years . moshinsky and szczepaniak named it dirac oscillator and renewed to a great extent the interest in the topic @xcite . besides intrinsic mathematical interest ,",
    "the study of the dirac oscillator has drawn much attention because of its various physical applications .",
    "for instance , moshinsky and szczepaniak @xcite showed that , in the non - relativistic limit , its becomes a harmonic oscillator with a strong spin - orbit coupling term plus a constant term .",
    "moreno and zentella @xcite showed that an exact foldy - wouthuysen transformation could be performed in the dirac oscillator . also , quesne and moshinsky @xcite studied its symmetry lie algebra explicitly .",
    "after , benitez et al .",
    "@xcite found the complete energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunction of the dirac oscillator .",
    "they found the electromagnetic potential associated with the dirac oscillator , and showed that this exactly soluble problem has a hidden supersymmetry , which is responsible for the special properties of its energy spectrum .",
    "they also calculated the related superpotential and discussed the implications of this supersymmetry on the stability of the dirac sea .",
    "some time later , nogami and toyama @xcite and toyama et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the behavior of wave packets of the dirac oscillator in the @xmath0 dimensional dirac representation .",
    "the aim of these authors was to study wave packets that represent coherent states .",
    "this reduction of the dimension was brought as an attempt to get rid of spin effects and to concentrate on the relativistic effects .",
    "also , rozmej and arvieu @xcite have shown a very interesting analogy between the relativistic dirac oscillator and the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "they showed that the strong spin - orbit coupling of the dirac oscillator produces an entanglement of the spin with the orbital motion similar to that is observed in quantum optic models .",
    "more recently , some attention has been given to the models of noncommutative quantum mechanics and the space noncommutativity version of the dirac oscillator was studied in refs .",
    "also , regarding the aharonov - bohm effect , the dirac oscillator in noncommutative spaces was considered by hassanabadi et al . @xcite .",
    "the authors then calculated the exact energy levels and the corresponding eigenfunctions by means of the nikiforov - uvarov method .",
    "besides , the dirac oscillator has also been discussed in connection with the @xmath1-deformed poincar - hopf algebra by andrade et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the study of the thermal properties of the one - dimensional dirac oscillator was carried out by some of us , some years ago @xcite .",
    "we applied a numerical method based on the euler - maclaurin formula to calculate the associated partition function and hence obtain the thermodynamic functions , such as the free energy , the mean energy and the heat capacity .",
    "since then , several studies have been made in connection with our initial results @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the method was initially used for the study of one - dimensional systems which have non - degenerate energy spectrum . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this approach has not been extended to three - dimensional systems with degeneracies of the eigenvalues .",
    "the present paper has as its main goal to extend the work of @xcite and to consider the full @xmath2 dirac oscillator .",
    "contrary to one - dimensional case we expect to observe new physical effects due to the presence of a large spin - orbit coupling and the existence of degeneracy in the energy spectrum .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermalproperties ] , we make a brief review of the dirac oscillator in a thermal bath , discussing the degeneracy of the stationary states and present our main results on the thermodynamic properties of the model .",
    "furthermore , we comment on the connection of our results with others in the literature . finally , we present our conclusions and final remarks in sec . [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "before discussing the thermal properties of the dirac oscillator , let us first briefly recall the main results on this system .",
    "the three - dimensional dirac equation for a free spin @xmath3 particle is @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are usual dirac matrices , @xmath8 is the rest mass of the particle and @xmath9 is the speed of light .",
    "the dirac oscillator can be obtained through the non - minimal substitution @xmath10 , which is linear in both the coordinate and the momentum .",
    "this leads to the hamiltonian @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the constant oscillator frequency .",
    "the non - relativistic limit of the dirac oscillator reproduces the usual harmonic oscillator added by a very large spin - orbit coupling plus a constant term .",
    "the complete solution for the dirac oscillator was first obtained by moshinsky and szczepaniak @xcite and the corresponding energy levels can be expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the total angular momentum , the orbital angular momentum and the principal quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "these expressions can be rewritten in another manner as @xmath17 such that @xmath18 while @xmath19 is the radial quantum number @xcite .",
    "we see from eqs . -",
    "that the stationary states exhibit a great deal of degeneracy .",
    "for instance , the energy levels with @xmath20 depend only on the values of @xmath21 . since @xmath15 can take any integer value",
    ", the states are infinitely degenerate .",
    "in particular , for @xmath22 @xmath23 all states are two - fold degenerate ( with fixed @xmath21 ) .",
    "further , when @xmath24 one has that @xmath25 and the energy depends on the combination of quantum numbers @xmath26 , but now the degeneracy remains finite , increasing with the @xmath27 value .    to carry out our analysis on the thermodynamics of the dirac oscillator , we will restrict ourselves to stationary states of positive energy and whose degeneracy remains finite .",
    "the reason for this is twofold .",
    "first , the hamiltonian for the dirac oscillator admits an exact foldy - wouthuysen transformation ( fwt ) , such that the positive- and negative - energy solutions never mix , leaving the dirac sea stable @xcite .",
    "consequently , we can assume that only particles with positive energy are available in order to set up a thermodynamic ensemble .",
    "second , the solutions with infinite degeneracy do not correspond to physical states since there is not lorentz finite representation for them .",
    "now let us write the main object of our interest , the canonical partition function @xmath28 at finite temperature @xmath29 .",
    "for the positive energy levels with @xmath24 , the following equation for @xmath28 holds : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath33 is the degree of degeneracy for the energy level @xmath34 defined as @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 being a dimensionless constant .    in order to determine @xmath33 , let us note that for each pair @xmath39 there are @xmath40 degenerate states differing with values of the angular momentum projection quantum number @xmath41 .",
    "for a given ( positive integer , see above ) @xmath27 , the total degree of degeneracy is given by @xmath42    therefore , the partition function @xmath28 of the dirac oscillator can be rewritten as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for simplicity ,",
    "over the remainder of the work , we adopted the natural unit system @xmath47 ) , such that all parameters are considered dimensionless .    according to the above considerations",
    ", we can define the thermodynamic functions of interest as follows : @xmath48    as our initial evaluation , we consider the convergence of the series in eq . .",
    "applying the integral test , this series is convergent since @xmath49 is a monotonic decreasing function and the associated integral @xmath50,\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is finite .    in order to get an insight into the convergence speed of the series , needed to find the high - temperature limit and",
    "numerically evaluate the partition function , we employ the euler - mclaurin summation formula @xcite : @xmath51-\\sum_{i=2}^{p}\\frac{b_{i}}{i!}\\big[f^{(i-1)}(a)\\big]\\nonumber \\\\   &   & -\\int_{a}^{b}dt\\frac{b_{p}\\big(\\{1-t\\}\\big)}{p!}f^{(p)}(t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the bernoulli polynomials and bernoulli numbers , respectively , @xmath54 is any positive integer and the symbol @xmath55 denotes the fractional part . after fixing a number @xmath56 of terms ,",
    "the partition function will become    @xmath57    in the high - temperature regime , where @xmath58 , only the first term in have significant contribution for the partition function .",
    "hence , in this limit we have @xmath59 which gives the asymptotic behavior for the average energy and specific heat : @xmath60 let us note that all functions are written in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath61where @xmath62 stands for the characteristic temperature of the system .",
    "this quantity is analogous to the so - called debye temperature defined in solid state physics .    as in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "the equations and show that , at high temperatures , the mean energy and the specific heat are twice greater than the non - relativistic three - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "this result is consistent with the equipartition theory applied for an extreme relativistic ideal gas , and despite the presence of a stronger spin - orbit coupling in the hamiltonian of the dirac oscillator , the asymptotic behaviour of the functions described above is unaffected .",
    "thus , at high temperatures the relativistic effects become dominant @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this same relation holds for the one - dimensional kemmer oscillator @xcite and the two - dimensional noncommutative dirac oscillator @xcite .",
    "in the sequel , we briefly depict our numerical results on the evaluation of the thermodynamic functions - and compare them with the one - dimensional case , commenting on the main features of the new profiles . here , we plot all profiles of the thermal quantities as a function of the dimensionless temperature @xmath63 for different values of the parameter @xmath64 .",
    "thus , we have chosen @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which implies an oscillator frequency within the range @xmath69 @xmath70 .",
    "the results that we obtained are shown in the figures [ fig : the - free - energy ] , [ fig : the - mean - energy ] , [ fig : the - entropy ] and [ fig : the - specific - heat ] . the overall conclusion being that the profiles of the curves behave in the same general way of their one - dimensional counterpart @xcite . however , in all cases the values of the functions are raised with respect to the one - dimensional case due to the degeneracy of the energy levels .",
    "the helmholtz free energy @xmath71 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - free - energy ] .",
    "notice that for a fixed value of @xmath63 , the free energy increases when @xmath64 grows .",
    "in all cases , the profile of the curves decreases monotonically with the temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - mean - energy ] , we plot the mean energy such that all curves have the same linear behavior and exhibit very close profiles .",
    "figure [ fig : the - entropy ] displays the entropy , and we identify that it increases as we reduce the value of the parameter @xmath64 . finally , the specific heat for the 3d dirac oscillator is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : the - specific - heat ] , which reveals that all the profiles have the same general behavior , reaching the limit value @xmath72 as predicted by eq . , monotonically .",
    "this result reveals that the specific heat is three times greater than that of the one - dimensional dirac oscillator for high temperatures @xcite .",
    "also , we point out that this same relation holds for the one - dimensional kemmer oscillator @xcite .",
    "the present work was devoted to study the three - dimensional dirac oscillator in thermal bath .",
    "we focused on thermodynamic properties derived from the canonical partition function at finite temperature @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , the high - temperature limit has been worked out and the asymptotic values for the mean energy and the specific heat were determined .",
    "also , the profiles of the main thermodynamic functions have been evaluated . as a result , we have observed an effective increase on the values of the functions . in particular , the asymptotic value for the specific heat is three times bigger than the one - dimensional case .",
    "this result indicates the effect of the degeneracy on the general behaviour of the system .",
    "recently , the first experimental realization of the dirac oscillator was carried out by franco - villafae _",
    "et al_. @xcite and we expect that our results may be used as a good tool to study the thermodynamic properties of dirac - like equations .",
