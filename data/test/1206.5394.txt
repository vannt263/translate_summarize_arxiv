    "it has been almost five decades , since the pioneer work of hnon and heiles [ 1 ] , who studied the regular and chaotic character of motion in a system of two coupled harmonic oscillators . during these years",
    "several methods have been presented in order to distinguish order from chaos . among them , it is worth mentioning , the method based on the fourier spectra of trajectories ( see [ 2,18 ] ) , the lyapunov characteristic exponents ( l.c.es)(see [ 19 ] ) and the ks entropy ( see [ 3 ] ) .",
    "apart from the above methods , in systems of two degrees of freedom , one can apply the classical method of the poincar phase plane , in order to distinguish regular from chaotic motion . on the contrary , in a 3d system",
    "the above method can not be applied . on this basis , it is of particular interest to locate the regions of initial conditions in 3d potentials generating regular or chaotic motion .",
    "the aim of the present article is to investigate the nature of motion in the 3d potential @xmath3 , \\ \\",
    "\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the common frequency of oscillation along @xmath5 and @xmath6 axis , while @xmath7 is the perturbation strength .",
    "potential ( 1 ) represents three coupled harmonic oscillators in the 1:1:1 resonance .",
    "potentials of this type are also known as perturbed elliptic oscillators ( see [ 5,6 ] ) .",
    "the basic reason for the choice of potential ( 1 ) is that perturbed elliptic oscillators appear very often in galactic dynamics and atomic - particle physics ( see [ 5 ] and references therein ) .",
    "a second reason is that it displays exact periodic orbits , interesting sticky orbits together with large chaotic regions .",
    "therefore , it gives a good chance in order to check the reliability of the @xmath1 spectrum ( see [ 7,10 ] ) , which is used as an indicator to track the sticky orbits and to distinguish between regular and chaotic motion .",
    "the outcomes of this research are mainly based on the numerical integration of the equations of motion @xmath8 where the dot indicates derivatives with respect to the time .",
    "the hamiltonian to the potential ( 1 ) reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the momenta per unit mass conjugate to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , while @xmath12 is the numerical value of the hamiltonian .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the analysis of the structure of the @xmath13 poincar phase plane of the 2d system for a set of values of energy @xmath12 . in the same section ,",
    "we give some examples for the reader to understand the usefulness of the @xmath1 spectrum , since it has the ability to describe islandic and sticky motion . in section 3",
    "we study the character of orbits in the 3d system .",
    "special interest is given to the evolution of the exact periodic orbits .",
    "particularly , we are interested to find the value of energy , where orbits starting near the exact periodic orbits change their character from regular to chaotic .",
    "we close our investigation with section 4 , where a discussion and the conclusions of this research are presented .",
    "in the following we shall study the character of motion in the corresponding 2d potential @xmath14 it is well known , that in this potential the two axes @xmath15 and @xmath16 and the straight lines @xmath17 are exact periodic orbits ( see [ 8 ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian to potential ( 4 ) writes @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the numerical value of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is interesting to note , that potential ( 4 ) has not a finite energy of escape , so the corresponding zero velocity curves ( zvcs ) are always closed . in all numerical calculations ,",
    "we adopt the values : @xmath20 , while the energy is treated as a parameter .",
    "figure 1a shows the @xmath13 , @xmath21 phase plane , when @xmath22 .",
    "one can see , that a large part of the phase plane is covered by chaotic orbits .",
    "the regular regions are occupied by invariant curves around the points @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the above points give the positions of two exact periodic orbits , the first is the @xmath16 axis while the second describes the @xmath17 straight line orbits on the @xmath13 phase plane .",
    "furthermore , one observes a large number of smaller islands of invariant curves produced by secondary resonances and some sticky regions as well .",
    "figure 1b is similar to fig . 1a but when @xmath25 .",
    "here we see that the majority of the phase plane is covered by a chaotic sea .",
    "the regular regions are confined only around the straight line periodic orbits , while the @xmath16 axis has now become unstable .",
    "some smaller islands of invariant curves are also present .",
    "the most interesting feature observed in this case , is the sticky regions around the chain of islands of invariant curves on the @xmath15 as well as on the @xmath26 axis .",
    "we shall come to this point later in this section .",
    "if we increase the value of energy to @xmath27 , we obtain the phase plane shown in figure 1c . in this case",
    ", the @xmath16 axis has returned to stability , while the straight line periodic orbits are unstable .",
    "almost all the phase plane is chaotic , except of a small region around the center and some small islands of invariant curves which are products of secondary resonances . a sticky region around the chain of the small islands of invariant curves near the center is also observed .",
    "figure 1d is similar to fig . 1a but when @xmath28 .",
    "this value of the energy is the value of the energy of escape of the 3d potential ( see next section ) . here",
    "almost all the phase plane is covered by chaotic orbits .",
    "there is a tiny regular region near the center .",
    "a careful observation also shows some very small regular islands of invariant curves embedded in the chaotic sea .",
    "0.02 cm    one can see , that the fraction of the phase plane covered by chaotic orbits increases as the energy @xmath19 increases .",
    "figure 2a shows a plot of the percentage of the phase plane @xmath29 covered by chaotic orbits vs @xmath19 .",
    "we observe that @xmath29 increases rapidly , as @xmath12 increases .",
    "dots indicate values of @xmath29 found numerically , while the solid line is a fourth degree polynomial fitting curve .",
    "we would like to make clear , that @xmath29 is estimated on a completely empirical basis , by measuring the area on the @xmath13 phase plane occupied by chaotic orbits ( see [ 11 ] ) . in order to have an estimation of the degree of chaos from another point of view",
    ", we have plotted the maximum l.c.e vs @xmath19 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2b .",
    "note that the l.c.e increases linearly with @xmath19 . here",
    ", we must point out that it is well known that the l.c.e has different values in each chaotic component ( see [ 20 ] ) .",
    "since we have regular regions in all cases and a large chaotic area with small sticky regions embedded in each chaotic sea , we calculate the average value of the l.c.e in each case by taking fifty orbits with different initial conditions @xmath30 , in each chaotic domain . in all cases ,",
    "the obtained values of the l.c.es were different in the fourth decimal point , in the same chaotic area .",
    "0.02 cm    0.02 cm    0.02 cm    0.02 cm    interesting information not only for the chaotic or regular character of orbits but also for islandic and sticky motion can be obtained using the dynamical parameter of the @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the successive values of the @xmath34 orbital elements on the poincar @xmath13 phase plane .",
    "the dynamical spectrum of the parameter @xmath31 is its distribution function @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the number of the parameters @xmath31 in the interval @xmath37 , after @xmath38 iterations .",
    "this dynamical spectrum has been proved a very reliable tool in several cases ( see [ 7,10 ] for details ) .",
    "the nature of a 2d orbit can be identified by the shape of the @xmath1 spectrum . if the structure of the spectrum is a well formed @xmath39-type shape , then the corresponding orbit is regular . on the other hand ,",
    "if the shape of the spectrum is complicated , asymmetric , with a lot of of small and large abrupt peaks , then this indicates that the orbit is chaotic .",
    "moreover , the @xmath1 spectrum can help us identify resonant orbits or orbits of higher multiplicity , as it produces as much @xmath39-type spectra as the total number of the islands of invariant curves in the @xmath13 phase plane .",
    "one additional advantage of this spectrum , is that it can be used in order to calculate the sticky period of a 2d sticky orbit and also to help us follow its time evolution towards the chaotic sea .    at this point",
    ", we should emphasize that there are some spectra , such as the @xmath40 spectrum , ( see [ 23 ] ) , which have no ability to identify islandic or sticky motion .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath40 spectrum needs the computation of two neighboring orbits and a large number of iterations ( about @xmath41 ) in order to provide reliable results regarding the character of a 2d orbit . using the @xmath1 spectrum we have managed to overcome these drawbacks .",
    "recently , in [ 24 ] we introduced the @xmath42 spectrum which proved to be a very sensitive and reliable spectrum .",
    "this new spectrum definition allow us to study more accurately the islandic motion of resonant orbits of higher multiplicity , as it produces as much spectra as the total number of the islands of invariant curves in the @xmath13 phase plane .",
    "the main advantage of the @xmath42 is that it has the ability to detect complicated resonant orbits especially in 2d hamiltonian systems , no matter how small are the corresponding islands of invariant curves .",
    "furthermore , for the study of orbits in 3d hamiltonian systems , we constructed and used in [ 25 ] the @xmath43 dynamical spectrum .",
    "this spectrum is an advanced form of the @xmath1 spectrum and it was especially designed for the study of 3d orbits , as it produces as much spectra as the total number of the 3d invariant tori in the @xmath44 phase subspace .    in what follows we present some examples in order to visualize the usefulness of the @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "figure 3a - b shows the @xmath1 spectrum and the corresponding l.c.e vs time of an orbit with initial conditions : @xmath45 and @xmath22 , while in all cases the initial value of @xmath46 is always found from the energy integral .",
    "we see a @xmath39 type spectrum indicating regular motion while the corresponding l.c.e tends asymptotically to zero .",
    "figure 4a - b is similar to fig .",
    "3a - b for an orbit with initial conditions : @xmath47 and @xmath25 .",
    "here we see a spectrum with a lot of asymmetric small and large peaks indicating chaotic motion . the plot of the l.c.e vs time in fig .",
    "4b verifies the results of the spectrum .",
    "the @xmath1 spectrum is useful in order to detect islandic and sticky motion .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5a - d .",
    "figure 5a shows an orbit with initial conditions : @xmath48 and @xmath25 .",
    "this orbit produces the two sets of five islands shown near the @xmath15-axis in fig .",
    "1b . note that the corresponding spectrum produces ten individual regular spectra each one corresponding to an island . as the orbit produces two different sets of five islands on the positive and negative side of the @xmath15-axis ,",
    "we observe two sets of five spectra almost symmetric to the origin .",
    "figure 5b shows the spectrum of a nearby orbit .",
    "the initial conditions are : @xmath49 and @xmath19=2 .",
    "this orbit produces the two sticky regions around each set of the five islands near the @xmath15-axis shown in fig .",
    "1b . as there are two areas of sticky motion we see two separate sticky spectra with asymmetric large and small peaks . here",
    "the time is @xmath50 time units .",
    "figure 5c is similar to 5b but when @xmath51 time units .",
    "we see two different asymmetric spectra .",
    "this indicates that the test particle is still in the sticky region .",
    "figure 5d shows the spectrum when @xmath52 time units . in this case",
    ", we see that the two spectra have joined to produce a unified chaotic spectrum .",
    "this indicates that the test particle has left the sticky region and has gone into the chaotic sea .",
    "the l.c.e vs time of the orbit described above is shown in figure 6 .",
    "all l.c.es were computed for a time period of @xmath53 time units .",
    "the above results strongly suggest that the @xmath1 spectrum is a powerful dynamical parameter providing useful and reliable results for distinguishing between order and chaos .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath1 spectrum describes very satisfactorily islandic and sticky motion .",
    "in this section we shall investigate the regular or chaotic behavior of the orbits in the 3d potential ( 1 ) .",
    "working in a similar way as in caranicolas and varvoglis [ 9 ] , we find that this potential has an energy of escape given by @xmath54 for values of @xmath55 the zero velocity surface is open and the test particle is free to escape to infinity . in this paper",
    "we investigate only bounded motion that is we consider always @xmath56 . for the adopted values of the parameters @xmath20",
    "we find that @xmath57 .",
    "figure 7 shows the surface @xmath58 .",
    "note that in the potential ( 1 ) the straight lines @xmath59 are exact periodic orbits .",
    "using the origin @xmath60 as a starting point we find from hamiltonian ( 3 ) that the starting value of the corresponding velocities are @xmath61 , while the value of @xmath46 is obtained from the energy integral .",
    "0.02 cm    0.02 cm    0.02 cm    0.02 cm    in order to find the regular or chaotic nature of the 3d orbits we choose initial conditions @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a point on the phase plane of the 2d system .",
    "this point lies inside the limiting curve @xmath64 which is the curve containing all the invariant curves of the 2d system .",
    "we use @xmath65 and the value of @xmath46 , for all orbits , is obtained from the energy integral ( 3 ) .",
    "the numerical calculations suggest , that orbits with initial conditions @xmath62 , such as @xmath63 is a point in the chaotic regions of fig .",
    "1 a - d and for all permissible values of @xmath66 , produce chaotic orbits .    on the other hand , it would be also interesting to investigate the character of orbits with initial conditions @xmath62 , such as @xmath63 is a point in the regular regions of fig .",
    "1 a - d . we shall use the @xmath1 spectrum and in order to verify the effectiveness of the @xmath1 spectrum in 3d dynamical systems , we shall compare the results with two other indicators , the classical method of the l.c.e and the spectral method @xmath2 , used by karanis and vozikis [ 18 ] .",
    "this method , uses the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of a series of time intervals , each one representing the time that elapsed between two successive points on the poincar @xmath13 phase plane , for 2d systems , while for 3d systems they take two successive points on the plane @xmath67 .",
    "note that the coupling of the third component , @xmath6 , carrying all the information about the 3d orbits , is hidden in the definition of the @xmath1 spectrum , but in any case it affects the values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 entering eq .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 spectrum provides implicit results for the 3d orbits . on the other hand , using the new @xmath43 spectrum the outcomes are explicit , since the coupling of the third component @xmath6 is located directly in its definition .",
    "figure 8 a - d shows ( a ) the 3d orbit , ( b ) the corresponding l.c.e .",
    "( c ) the @xmath1 spectrum and ( d ) the @xmath2 indicator , of an orbit with initial conditions : @xmath70 .",
    "the value of energy is @xmath71 , while in all cases the value of @xmath46 is found from the energy integral .",
    "all dynamical indicators coincide that this orbit is regular .",
    "figure 9a - d is similar to fig .",
    "8a - d but for a chaotic 3d orbit .",
    "initial conditions are : @xmath72 , @xmath71 . here",
    "one observes an asymmetric @xmath1 spectrum with a lot of small and large peaks indicating chaotic motion .",
    "the l.c.e in figure 9b and the @xmath2 indicator in figure 9d , coincide with the results of the spectrum .",
    "finally , we shall study the character of orbits starting near the 3d exact periodic orbits .",
    "figure 10 a - d is similar to fig .",
    "8 a - d but for an orbit starting near the 3d exact periodic orbit .",
    "initial conditions are : @xmath73 , @xmath71 .",
    "the l.c.e , the @xmath1 spectrum and the @xmath2 indicator suggest for regular motion . figure 11 a - d is similar to fig .",
    "9 a - d but when @xmath74 . here",
    "the dynamical indicators reveal the chaotic nature of this orbit .",
    "the numerical calculations indicate that orbits starting near the exact periodic orbits become chaotic when @xmath75 .",
    "figure 12 shows a plot of the l.c.e vs @xmath12 for the chaotic orbits in the 3d system .",
    "we see that the l.c.e increases linearly as @xmath12 increases .",
    "note that the values of the l.c.es of the 3d system are smaller than the corresponding values of the l.c.es of the 2d system .",
    "potentials composed of harmonic oscillators have been frequently used during the last years by several researchers [ 4 , 12 - 16 ] . in this article",
    "we have studied the regular or chaotic character of orbits in a 3d potential made up of perturbed elliptic oscillators .",
    "this potential displays exact periodic orbits , that are straight lines going through the origin , together with extended chaotic regions .",
    "our investigation begins from the 2d potential . in order to keep things simple",
    "we tried to study the regular or chaotic character of orbits for fixed values of the two other parameters and different values of the energy .",
    "our numerical calculations have shown that the extend of chaotic regions increases rapidly as the value of the energy increases .",
    "on the other hand , we have found that the degree of chaos also increases as the energy of increases .",
    "the numerical experiments show that the l.c.e increases linearly with @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , the application of the @xmath1 spectrum shows that this dynamical parameter is a fast and reliable indicator in order to distinguish order from chaos . note that in order to obtain the @xmath1 spectrum we need only one orbit and 3000 - 10000 time units , while in order to obtain the l.c.e we use two orbits and much longer time periods .",
    "moreover , the @xmath1 spectrum describes in a very satisfactorily way islandic and sticky motion . on the other hand ,",
    "the time needed in order to obtain the @xmath2 indicator , is of order of 5000 time units .    using the results of the 2d potential we proceeded to study the 3d model .",
    "first we tried to find the character of the 3d orbits with @xmath65 and initial conditions @xmath62 , such as @xmath63 is a point in ( i ) in the chaotic regions or ( ii ) in the regular regions of fig .",
    "the numerical results indicate that all orbits of type ( i ) are chaotic .",
    "the orbits of type ( ii ) display a different behavior .",
    "the numerical outcomes suggest that for small values of @xmath6 @xmath76 the orbits remain regular , while for larger values of @xmath6 @xmath77 the motion becomes chaotic .",
    "the regular or chaotic nature of the 3d orbits can be found using the @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "comparison with the l.c.e and the @xmath2 spectral method , shows that the @xmath1 spectrum is a good and fast indicator in order to distinguish regular from chaotic motion , in 3d dynamical systems . in the present research",
    ", we have choose to use dynamical parameters , such as the @xmath1 spectrum and the @xmath2 indicator , in order to characterize the nature of orbits , because the main advantage of these new methods is that they can provide reliable and conclusive results in short integration time periods , that is @xmath78 time units .",
    "here , we must point out that there are also other new dynamical indicators , such as the fli [ 17 ] , sali [ 21 ] and gali [ 22 ] .",
    "these indicators need at most 500 to 1000 time units of integration time , in order to reveal the true nature of an orbit in hamiltonian systems .",
    "the main disadvantage of the above methods is that we can not use them to identify resonant orbits of higher multiplicity which correspond to multiple islands of invariant curves in the phase plane .",
    "moreover , fli and gali are not very sensitive in the case of sticky motion . on the contrary , the sali method can provide reliable information about sticky orbits , using shorter integration time than the s(c ) spectrum .    note",
    "that an interesting characteristic of this investigations is that both , the 2d and 3d potentials display exact periodic orbits and large chaotic regions .",
    "the numerical results , in the 2d and the 3d model , show that , for small values of the energy , orbits starting near the exact periodic orbits remain regular , while for larger values of the energy become chaotic .",
