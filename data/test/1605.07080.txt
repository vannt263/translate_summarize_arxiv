    "critical temperature @xmath0 and the second critical magnetic field @xmath1 are some of the key characteristics of a superconductor .",
    "these parameters depend on an effective coupling constant with some collective excitations @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is a density of states at fermi level , @xmath4 is an interaction constant ) , on frequency of the collective excitations @xmath5 and on ginzburg - landau ( gl ) parameter @xmath6 ( @xmath7 )",
    ". the larger coupling constant , the larger the critical temperature . for large",
    "@xmath8 we have @xmath9 @xcite ( or @xmath10 in bcs theory ) .",
    "formally the critical temperature can be made arbitrarily large with increasing of the electron - phonon coupling constant . however in order to reach room temperature such values of the coupling constant are necessary which are not possible in real materials .",
    "on the other hand we can increase the frequency @xmath5 due nonphonon pairing mechanisms as proposed in @xcite .",
    "however with increasing of the frequency the coupling constant decreases as @xmath11 . the second critical magnetic field can be enlarged in a `` dirty '' limit , where the mean free path @xmath12 is much less than a cohernce length @xmath13 @xcite . in this case",
    "the gl parameter can be @xmath14 , but still the critical field is low near the critical temperature : @xmath15 .",
    "many different types of superconducting materials with a wide variety of electron pairing mechanisms exist , however all they have the critical temperature limited by values @xmath16 , despite the fact that the highly exotic mechanisms have been proposed .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath8 determines a value of the energy gap at zero temperature @xmath17 , in the same time a ratio between the gap and the critical temperature exists : @xmath18 for presently known materials . thus increasing the zero temperature gap @xmath19 we enlarge @xmath0 .",
    "however the critical temperature can be enlarged by violation the ratio ( [ 0.1 ] ) as @xmath20 due some addition influence on condensate of cooper pairs as shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "the simplest examples of such systems are systems where the proximity effect takes place : two superconductors are placed in contact @xcite , or in multi - band superconductors where the interband mixing of order parameters from different bands occurs @xcite . in this cases the cooper pairs are injected into the superconductor ( band ) from another superconductor ( band ) with higher critical temperature ( stronger interaction ) which plays a role of a source of cooper pairs . as a result in a band with lower critical temperature the ratio ( [ 0.1 ] ) can be violated as @xmath21 @xcite as illustrated in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "however the source is function of temperature with own critical temperature . in a case of the contact of two metal the critical temperature of the source drops , however in a case of the multi - band superconductor the proximity effect supports superconducting state in all bands .",
    "and critical temperature @xmath22 are as in bcs theory : @xmath23 .",
    "the gap @xmath24 and the temperature @xmath25 are such that @xmath26 as it can be in two - band superconductors @xcite .",
    "the gap @xmath27 asymptotically aspires to zero as temperature rises , so that @xmath28 .",
    "thus the critical temperature @xmath29 is equal to infinity in this hypothetical situation.,width=302 ]    the hypothetical system where @xmath30 is first proposed in @xcite . in this work",
    "the pairing of massless dirac electrons and holes located on opposite surfaces of thin film of three - dimensional topological insulator is considered .",
    "in such a system both electron - hole coulomb attraction , which leads to pairing , and tunnelling ( or hybridization ) of the electrons between surfaces , which leads to appearance in hamiltonian the `` sources '' of cooper pairs , act jointly . at @xmath31",
    "the gap gradually tends to some value @xmath32 .",
    "thus the hybridization leads to the smearing of a phase transition into the paired state in close analogy with the behavior of a ferromagnetic in an external magnetic field .",
    "this solution means the nonzero energy gap @xmath33 if the electron - hole attraction is switched off or temperature is infinite , that is not correct physically . in its turn",
    "the systems with `` preformed '' cooper pairs have been considered in a work @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the electrons are paired , but they lack the phase coherence necessary for superconductivity .",
    "the existence of preformed pairs implies the existence of a characteristic energy scale associated to a pseudogap . in a work @xcite a model of hypothetical superconductivity",
    "has been proposed , which demonstrates the principal differences from results of bcs and gl theory due presence of the source term in the model hamiltonian .",
    "unlike the previous works in this model the paired state is absent if the electron - electron coupling is absent @xmath34 .",
    "this means the electron - electron coupling is the cause of the transition to superconducting state only but not the source term . in this theory",
    "the source term determines energy of a cooper pair in some external field which can be called as the _ external pair potential _ by analogy with the terminology in @xcite . in a case of decreasing of cooper pair s energy by the potential the energy gap tends to zero asymptotically as temperature increases .",
    "thus the ratio between the gap and the critical temperature is @xmath30 instead of a finite value in bcs theory . in this work",
    "the free energy functional in the limit @xmath31 has been obtained .",
    "it is shown that the energy gap tends to zero asymptotically as magnetic field increases .",
    "thus the second critical magnetic field is equal to infinity as well as the critical temperature , that is not correct physically , because distance between vortexes can not be less than diameter of the vortex s core .    in present work",
    "we generalize bcs theory in the sense that the invariant under @xmath35 transformation source of cooper pairs ( the external pair potential ) @xmath36 is added to bcs hamiltonian .",
    "we demonstrate that such a hamiltonian describes a hypothetical substance , where an interaction energy between ( within ) structural elements of condensed matter ( molecules , nanoparticles , clusters , layers , wires etc . )",
    "depends on state of cooper pairs : an additional work @xmath37 must be made against this interaction to break a pair . in this model",
    "the potential @xmath37 essentially renormalizes the order parameter so that the ratio ( [ 0.1 ] ) changes as @xmath20 if the breaking of a cooper pair increases energy of the molecular structure ( or creation of the pair lowers the energy ) . in another regime (",
    "the breaking of a cooper pair lowers the energy of the structure ) the renormalization of the order parameter by the potential @xmath37 suppresses a superconducting state and the first order phase transition occurs .",
    "we obtain the free energy of such a system which generalizes landau free energy for the presence of the external pairing potential . for the case @xmath20 in the limit @xmath31",
    "we formulate the effective gl theory which is obtained in high - temperature limit from the general expression for free energy ( unlike the work @xcite where the free energy functional was obtained modifying the ordinary gl expansion ) .",
    "results of our effective gl theory radically differ from results of the ordinary gl theory : the coherence length decreases as temperature rises , the gl parameter and the second critical field are increasing functions of temperature .",
    "according to bcs theory an electron - electron attraction leads to the appearance of nonzero anomalous averages @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which are the order parameter ( pair potential ) of the superconducting state .",
    "the order parameter is determined with some self - consistency equation @xmath40 , which reflects the fact , that superconductivity is a many - particle cooperative effect . in this regime",
    "the charge is carried by pairs of electrons ( current carriers are the pairs with charge @xmath41 ) . to break a pair with transfer of its constituents in free quasiparticle states",
    "the energy @xmath42 is needed .",
    "we can consider the quantity @xmath42 as a work against the effective electron - electron attraction given the fact that the quantity @xmath19 is a collective effect .",
    "the superconducting state of a metal and the breaking of a pair are illustrated in fig.[fig2]a .    in our model",
    "we consider a hypothetical substance , where an interaction energy between ( within ) structural elements of condensed matter ( molecules , nanoparticles , clusters , layers , wires etc . )",
    "depends on state of cooper pairs : if the pair is broken , then energy of the molecular system is changed by quantity @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are energies of the system after- and before the breaking of the pair accordingly . thus to break the cooper pair",
    "we must make the work against the effective electron - electron attraction and must change the energy of the structural elements : @xmath46 we will call the parameter @xmath37 as the _ external pair potential _",
    ", since it is imposed on the electron subsystem by the structural elements of a substance , unlike the pair potential @xmath19 , which is result of electron - electron interaction and determined with the self - consistency equation @xmath40 . the parameter @xmath37 can be either @xmath47 or @xmath48 and in the simplest case it is not function of the energy gap @xmath49 , @xmath50 is a trivial case corresponding to bcs theory .",
    "moreover we suppose that @xmath37 does not depend on temperature essentially like parameters of electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the condition @xmath51 ensures stability of the cooper pairs ( bound state of the electrons is energetically favorable ) , otherwise transformation ( [ 1.1 ] ) has no sense and such superconducting state can not exist .",
    "if @xmath48 then the breaking of a cooper pair lowers energy of the molecular structure ( or creation of the pair raises the energy ) . in this case",
    "the pairs become less stable .",
    "if @xmath47 then the breaking of the pair increases the energy ( or creation of the pair lowers the energy ) . in this case",
    "the pairs become more stable .",
    "a possible variant of breaking of a cooper pair in these cases is illustrated in fig.[fig2]b and fig.[fig2]c .    without going into the details of interaction of the structural elements",
    "we can write an effective hamiltonian which takes into account the effect of the structure on cooper pairs as some effective external field , like the bcs hamiltonian is an effective hamiltonian describing a system of interacting electrons independently of nature of this interaction .",
    "the order parameter @xmath19 is a complex quantity @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a phase , and it is the result of a many - particle self - consistent coherent effect . in the same time",
    "the field @xmath37 is an additional parameter imposed on the electron subsystem by the structural elements .",
    "it is easy to see that the following transformations of the order parameter correspond to the transformation ( [ 1.1 ] ) : @xmath54 really the work to break the pair is @xmath55 however the transformations ( [ 1.2 ] ) correspond to the transformation ( [ 1.1 ] ) if @xmath51 only . if @xmath56 then the work is @xmath57 . thus the model based on the transformations ( [ 1.2 ] ) can give `` parasitic '' solutions where the the condition ( [ 1.1 ] ) is not satisfied .",

    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 in @xmath36 the energy does not depend on the phase @xmath53 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "thus both @xmath59 and @xmath36 are invariant under the @xmath35 transformation .",
    "the term @xmath36 is similar to `` source term '' in @xcite , where it means the injection of cooper pairs into the system . on the other hand",

    "eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath68 may not be eigenfunctions of a particle number operator @xmath69 , that reflects the presence of cooper pairs condensate .    in our model",
    "we make the following assumptions .",
    "a change of the chemical potential at transition to superconducting state can be neglected , so that @xmath70 , because in the model we suppose @xmath71 , that occurs for systems with week electron - electron attraction and high density of carriers unlike the systems with the strong attraction and low particle density in the bec regime , so that @xmath72 , where the change of the chemical potential plays important role in formation of the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "in addition we should notice that the coupling constant @xmath4 is a sum of phonon term and coulomb term : @xmath73 . in metals , as a rule , @xmath74 that corresponds to repulsive electron - electron interaction ,",
    "however in such systems the pairing is possible as result of the second order processes , which lead to effective attraction regardless of the sign of interaction @xcite : @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is a coulomb pseudopotential .",
    "such mechanism is not considered in our model . in the model",
    "we suppose a stronger condition @xmath77 , which can occur in nonmetallic superconductors ( for example , in alkali - doped fullerides @xmath78 , where competition between the jahn - teller coupling and hund s coupling takes place @xcite ) .     is needed .",

    "the first term is internal kinetic energy , the second term is energy of the electron - electron interaction , the third term is energy of cooper pairs condensate in the external pair field .",
