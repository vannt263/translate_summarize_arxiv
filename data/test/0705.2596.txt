    "chemists have recently constructed various synthetic molecular systems ( see e.g. @xcite and a review @xcite ) which can move on surfaces and tracks .",
    "one class of such objects aptly named spiders @xcite consists of relatively small molecules with legs which are short single - stranded segments of dna .",
    "these spiders can move on a surface covered with single - stranded dna segments , called substrates .",
    "the substrate dna is complementary to the leg dna .",
    "the motion proceeds as legs bind to the surface dna through the watson - crick mechanism , then dissociate , then rebind again , etc .",
    "more precisely , a bond on the substrate with an attached leg is first cleaved @xcite , and the leg then dissociates from the affected substrate ( which is called product @xcite ) .",
    "after that the leg can rebind to the new substrate or to the product .",
    "the rate of attachment of a leg of a spider to the substrate and the rate of detachment from the substrate are different from the corresponding rates involving the product .",
    "therefore for the proper description of the motion of a single spider one must keep track of its entire trajectory .",
    "this memory requirement makes the problem non - markovian @xcite .",
    "such problems tend to be intractable , though in one dimension non - markovian problems are occasionally solvable , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in this paper we continue the investigation of molecular spiders that move along one - dimensional tracks @xcite .",
    "the goal is to study the interplay between the spiders and their environment which has been ignored in ref .",
    "we shall assume that each leg of a spider steps independently and symmetrically to neighboring empty sites at rates 1 from revisited sites and at rates @xmath0 from sites visited for the first time .",
    "for molecular spiders @xmath1 since legs are bound more firmly to new sites .",
    "two types of spiders were introduced in @xcite which differ in the type of constraint that keeps the legs close to each other . for * local spiders * or centipedes , the distance between _ adjacent _ legs is @xmath2 ; for * global spiders * , the distance between _ any _ two legs is @xmath3 . without memory ( @xmath4 ) , spiders with local constraint can be mapped onto exclusion processes with open boundaries , while spiders with global constraint map to the simple exclusion process with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "these mappings simplify the computations of the diffusion coefficient and , e.g. , they allow to determine the diffusion coefficient for general global spiders with an arbitrary number of legs @xmath5 and an arbitrary maximal distance @xmath6 , and for local @xmath5-leg spiders with @xmath7 .    the non - markovian character does not make the problem hopeless since the visited area is very simple , namely the visited sites ( product ) form an island in the sea of unvisited sites .",
    "( this happens only in one dimension , and the two - dimensional problem appears intractable . ) graphically , we display a leg of the spider by @xmath8 , an empty sites as @xmath9 , and we put a hat at sites which have never been visited earlier , i.e.  where the dna substrate is still un - cleaved .",
    "a typical configuration for a bipedal spider then looks like @xmath10    the memory solely acts through the slowdown of legs on newly visited sites . for a one - leg spider , which is merely a random walk",
    ", memory does not affect the asymptotic behavior of the number of visited sites and other quantities .",
    "on the other hand , the slowdown generates an effective bias of multi - pedal spiders .",
    "this bias always points outward .",
    "remarkably , the slowdown effectively speeds the spider up , that is , it leads to the increase of the diffusion coefficient and the number of visited sites .    to mimic the effective bias of the spiders , we investigate a random walk which jumps asymmetrically from newly visited sites",
    "this model is similar to the so - called exited walk which has been actively investigated in recent years in the mathematics literature , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ 1leg ] , we analyze a random walk with memory .",
    "first we analyze the symmetric random walk that slows down on the new sites , and then we obtain exact results for the exited walk which additionally takes into account a bias on the new sites . in sec .",
    "[ 2legs ] , we discuss the behavior of the bipedal spiders with maximal leg distance @xmath7 .",
    "some of the properties of these spiders are exactly computed , while others are established via the analogy with the excited random walk . in sec .",
    "[ multi ] , we generalize these results to global spiders with @xmath11 . we draw conclusions in sec .  [ conc ] . finally , in an appendix , some of the details required for calculations of sec .",
    "[ 1leg ] are presented .",
    "in this section we consider the case of a one - leg spider .",
    "we shall begin with a nearest - neighbor symmetric random walk on the one - dimensional lattice . by definition ,",
    "if the walker occupies a site for the first time , the hopping rate to each of its nearest neighbors is @xmath0 ; if the walker has already visited this site in the past , it hops at rates 1 to the left and to the right .",
    "a quantity which is most readily computable is the average time @xmath13 for the random walk to cover @xmath12 sites .",
    "the total number of distinct sites visited by the random walk grows with time , and let @xmath14 be the time when the number of distinct sites first reaches @xmath15 ( here @xmath12 is the size of the island and the @xmath16 accounts for the site with the random walker on it ) .",
    "graphically , @xmath17 the walk starts at some site and hence @xmath18 ; all the following times @xmath19 are random quantities .",
    "we shall actually compute the first two moments of @xmath14 . the first moment ( the average )",
    "is @xmath20    to derive we first recall how to compute the mean exit time from the interval @xmath21 for the random walker hopping at unit rates to the right and to the left . by definition ,",
    "the exit time @xmath22 is the time for the random walker to reach any of the two boundaries , @xmath23 or @xmath24 , given that the walker starts at site @xmath25 .",
    "the procedure ( explained e.g. in @xcite ) is to analyze changes in an infinitesimal time interval @xmath26 .",
    "one writes @xmath27 and making the averaging one arrives at @xmath28 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the mean exit time , which simplifies to @xmath29 solving this equation subject to the boundary conditions @xmath30 we obtain @xmath31    returning to our problem , let us compute the time interval @xmath32 during which the number of visited sites jumps from @xmath15 to @xmath33 . without loss of generality we can assume that at @xmath14 the visited sites are @xmath34 , and the random walk is at site @xmath15 . similarly",
    "to we write an equation for the mean duration @xmath35 the factor @xmath12 in the middle term on the right - hand side was derived by taking into account that if the random walker hops to the left to site @xmath12 , the number of distinct sites will increase when the random walk reaches either site @xmath23 or @xmath33 .",
    "this latter problem is equivalent to the above exit problem after identifying @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and shows that the mean exit time is @xmath12 . from eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath38 using @xmath39 in conjunction with we arrive at .",
    "if the hopping rates were equal to unity everywhere ( no difference between the substrate and the product ) , we would have @xmath40 instead of . comparing these two results",
    "we see that only the sub - leading corrections ( linear in @xmath12 ) are different .",
    "hence the non - markovian nature has an asymptotically negligible influence on @xmath13 for the random walk .",
    "other calculations have led to the same conclusion .",
    "for instance , we have computed @xmath41 and we found @xmath42 for @xmath4 ( no memory ) equation becomes @xmath43 i.e. it has the same leading behavior .    in the @xmath44 limit",
    ", memory is very important in the earlier stage ; the crossover time @xmath45 after which memory becomes irrelevant is estimated by equating the linear and quadratic ( in @xmath12 ) terms in .",
    "this gives @xmath46 thus the memory does not affect the asymptotic behavior of @xmath47 for the nearest - neighbor random walk .",
    "this conclusion may be affected by the gait of the walk .",
    "unfortunately , even for the random walk it is hard to probe complicated gates when we take memory into account .",
    "for instance , if the random walk makes @xmath48 hops , say all at the same rates , the problem seems intractable .",
    "the above approach allows to compute @xmath13 only when the random walk hops to nearest - neighbor sites or gets back to its original site . for such gait",
    "we found @xmath49 hence the influence of memory on @xmath13 for this random walk with modified gait is again asymptotically irrelevant .",
    "we now turn to a more general excited walk ; we shall use these results for the bipedal spider in sec .",
    "[ 2legarea ] .",
    "an excited walk is defined as follows : when the walker leaves a particular site for the first time it jumps at rate @xmath50 forward ( to unvisited sites ) and at rate @xmath51 backward ( to revisit sites ) .",
    "when the walk jumps from a site it had already visited earlier , it jumps at rates one in both directions . for concreteness",
    "we define its first ever jump from the origin to the right at rate @xmath50 and to the left at rate @xmath51 .",
    "this special rule , however , is irrelevant in the long time limit which is our main focus .",
    "the above definition slightly differs from the definition of the excited random walk studied in refs .",
    "@xcite where it is a discrete time process , and where the excited walker is biased always into one specific direction ( say always to the right ) .    on the already visited sites , the walker performs a simple symmetric random walk .",
    "in the following analysis , we will need certain results for the simple random walk .",
    "particularly , for the walker on the interval @xmath52 $ ] we will need the exit probability density @xmath53 that the walker which starts at site @xmath54 inside the interval , @xmath55 , exits at any of the two end sites of the interval during the time interval @xmath56 .",
    "an elementary derivation of this probability density ( more precisely , of its laplace transform ) is given in appendix [ exit ] .",
    "one can try to repeat the calculation of @xmath13 in this more general situation .",
    "instead , we consider a dual quantity , namely we shall compute how the average number of visited sites increases with time .",
    "suppose that exited walk had already visited @xmath57 sites and it has just jumped to a new site . let the already visited sites be @xmath58 , and let the random walker be currently at @xmath59 .",

    "the above argument works also for the first ever step of the walk with our definition .",
    "if we prefer the assumption of hopping at rate @xmath50 in both directions for the first time , we have to use @xmath70 .",
    "this , however , does not affect the long time behavior .",
    "the probability density that the walk visits the @xmath71 new site at time @xmath61 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "the laplace transform of the convolution is @xmath74    one anticipates that the main contribution in the long time limit comes from terms with @xmath75 .",

    "the no bias case corresponds to @xmath84 , which coincides with any symmetric hopping @xmath85 .",
    "this has an interesting consequence  if the walk is only slowed down at new sites ( but not biased ) , then it has no effect on its long time behavior , in agreement with the conclusions of the previous subsection [ tn ] .",

    "we shall see that memory affects the leading behaviors , and we will explain these findings by showing that the slowdown of legs on new sites leads to effective outward bias when the spider is at the boundary of the island of visited sites .",
    "since the spider configuration is @xmath113 when a new site is first visited , it is convenient to start from the same type of configuration @xmath114 this assumption simplifies the calculation , but does not alter the asymptotic behavior .",

    "we now argue that a slowdown at new sites leads to an effective bias for bipedal spiders .",
    "imagine that the spider is in configuration .",
    "analyzing various routes , we obtain that the right leg first hops to the left with probability @xmath133 and otherwise it hops to right with probability @xmath134 .",
    "an explanation of is as follows .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side describes the probability that the first leg which is going to hop will be the right leg  this happens with probability @xmath135 and the leg ought to hop to the left .",
    "if the first leg to hop is the left leg  this happens with probability @xmath136  it then has to hop back ( the probability is again @xmath136 ) and then we are back to the initial configuration thereby providing us with factor @xmath137 .",
    "solving we find @xmath138    the probabilities @xmath139 and @xmath137 are somewhat misleading , e.g. if the right leg first hops to the left , the spider configurations are different  in the starting one @xmath140 the legs are separated , while in the final configuration @xmath141 the legs are in adjacent sites .",
    "it is easier to appreciate the probabilities @xmath142 and @xmath143 that the spider first moves forward and backward , respectively , while the configuration remains the same .",
    "let us rephrase this definition .",
    "first note that knowing the position @xmath25 of the center of mass fully determines the position of both legs of the bipedal spider with @xmath7 .",
    "we assign @xmath144 to the initial configuration .",
    "the jump of any leg changes the position of the center of mass by @xmath123 , hence @xmath25 takes half - integer values .",
    "we are interested in the probability @xmath142 that the center of mass moves forward by one lattice site to @xmath145 first , and in the probability @xmath146 that it moves backward to @xmath147 first .",
    "we already know the probabilities of the first jump of the right leg . with probability @xmath139 the right leg jumps to the right first , and",
    "the spider is already at @xmath145 .",
    "on the other hand , the right leg jumps to the left first with probability @xmath137 , which puts the spider at @xmath148 .",
    "the spider then performs a simple random walk on the half integers , and reaches @xmath145 first with probability @xmath149 .",
    "collecting these terms we arrive at @xmath150 and @xmath146 .",
    "thus the spider moves symmetrically when @xmath4 ( no memory ) , and as @xmath0 decreases , the bias _ forward _ increases monotonically .",
    "the bias is the strongest in the @xmath151 limit when @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "we now apply the above results to the bipedal spider .",
    "we approximate our spider by an effective walker that steps from already visited sites at rate one to both directions .",
    "the step length of this effective particle is @xmath154 .",
    "therefore it visits only half as many sites of the original lattice as a particle whose step length is one .",
    "thus @xmath155 with @xmath156 without memory we have @xmath157 .    from a new site , the effective particle hops predominantly in the forward direction .",
    "we approximate the ratio of the forward and backward rates of the effective particle by the ratio of the forward and backward probabilities , @xmath158 . using",
    "we conclude that parameter @xmath81 , see , becomes @xmath159 using and  we arrive at the prediction for the average number of visited sites at time @xmath61 : @xmath160 the amplitude @xmath161 depends only weakly on @xmath0 in the @xmath162 region .",

    "interestingly , a direct analysis of the spider motion is much more challenging both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "one can of course proceed numerically . according to simulations ,",
    "the position of the spider ( averaged over many runs ) follows a gaussian distribution in the large time limit .",
    "this is somewhat counterintuitive since the spider slows down at the extreme positions .",
    "overall this is a greatly simplifying feature since if the position is ( asymptotically ) gaussian , we can characterize the spider s motion solely by its diffusion coefficient @xmath170 .",
    "since the gaussian distribution gives the position of the spider in the large time limit , one might try to approximate its diffusion coefficient through the relation @xmath171 which is valid for simple random walks .",
    "this leads to @xmath172 for @xmath4 ( no memory ) , the relation @xmath173 is exact . for @xmath1",
    ", however , it underestimates the spider s diffusion coefficient , see fig .",
    "[ fig : diff ] .",
    "spiders with an arbitrary number of legs @xmath5 are difficult to analyze . here",
    "we consider global spiders which ( by definition ) satisfy the following constraint  the distance between any two legs is @xmath3 .",
    "since the site can not accommodate more than one leg @xmath174 , and the spiders with @xmath175 are immobile , so the first interesting case corresponds to @xmath176 .",

    "[ 2legs ] .",
    "first we notice that knowing the center of mass position of a spider with @xmath176 we can read off the position of all its legs .",

    "this simple first passage problem can be solved , see e.g. @xcite , to obtain .",
    "form , the probability that the rightmost leg first jumps to the left is @xmath181 the probability that the rightmost leg first jumps to the right is @xmath134 .",

    "as @xmath0 increases from 0 to @xmath183 , the bias to the right @xmath142 decreases monotonically , and the motion is unbiased @xmath184 for the neutral @xmath4 case .",
    "hence , a slowdown at new sites ( @xmath1 ) leads to the outward bias for arbitrary @xmath5 .",
    "it is also clear from that the bias is weaker for larger spiders .    to calculate the number of visited sites we first obtain @xmath185 from .",
    "recalling and taking into account the normalization @xmath186 we find the amplitude @xmath187 in the growth law @xmath188 .",
    "an agreement between theory and simulations is excellent , see fig .",
    "[ fig : amp ] .",
    "equation shows that @xmath189 is an increasing function of both @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath190 is a decreasing function of @xmath81 , we conclude that for @xmath11 global spiders the number of visited sites decreases as @xmath0 or @xmath5 grows .",
    "we believe that this is generally true for arbitrary spiders , i.e. @xmath191 decreases as @xmath0 or @xmath5 grows .",
    "intuitively it is easy to understand the monotonic @xmath5 dependence , as an additional leg only blocks the motion of the others .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath191 is more intriguing , since slowing down the spider actually results in more visited sites .",
    "one could argue that the slowdown at the boundary keeps the spider around the unvisited sites , hence it visits more of them .",
    "this argument , however , is flawed since the slowdown does not effect the behavior of a random walk as we saw it in sec .  [ 1leg ] .",
    "here is an argument that supports the above conjecture . when the rightmost leg steps to a new site it has to stretch out a bit . if legs slow down on new sites , it gives other legs time to catch up , which leads to the outward bias .",
    "another argument is that the when the rightmost leg stays longer at the new site , the second leg has more chance to step next to it , hence forcing the rightmost leg to the right . on the other hand , when the rightmost leg steps to a new site ,",
    "the spider is a bit stretched out and possibly can not step further due to some constraint ( e.g. local or global ) .",
    "when the rightmost leg stays in place longer , it gives more time to the other legs to step closer , allowing the rightmost leg to step to the right , hence it leads again to a bias to the right .",
    "in experimental realizations @xcite , spiders affect the environment which in turn affects their motion .",
    "more precisely , the state of any site on a surface changes irreversibly after the first visit of a leg of a spider and then it remains the same . during the subsequent visits legs",
    "are bound less firmly to previously visited sites , and we model this feature by prescribing different hopping rates from sites visited in the past and sites visited for the first time . namely a leg slows down on new sites while the spider remains agile inside a previously visited region .",
    "thus the knowledge of the spider s entire trajectory is required to describe its motion .",
    "first , we considered a random walk ( a one - leg spider ) that slows down on the new sites .",
    "we calculated first two moments , @xmath13 and @xmath41 , of the time @xmath14 to cover @xmath12 sites , and also the dual quantity @xmath192 , that is the average number of sites visited until time @xmath193 .",
    "all these quantities exhibit the same _ leading _ asymptotic behavior as in the case of a simple random walk without slowing down .",
    "these concrete results clearly reveal the general truth , namely that the non - markovian nature of the problem affects only sub - leading behaviors of the random walk with slowing down .",
    "all exact calculations support this conjecture , and we think that it is valid even in two dimensions .",
    "heuristically , the above hypothesis relies on the crucial feature of a random walk in one and two dimensions  the random walk keeps visiting the same sites again and again ( the average number of visits diverges with time ) , and therefore the slowing down on new sites becomes asymptotically less and less important .",
    "the above argument seemingly applies to spiders as well , so it was surprising that the computation of the average time @xmath13 to cover @xmath12 sites for the simplest bipedal spider with @xmath7 gave a result that differs from the corresponding result for the same bipedal spider without slowdown .",
    "thus , the slowdown affects the behavior even in the leading order .",
    "the especially striking feature is that the spider is effectively more agile , that is , the number of covered sites grows faster than for the same spider without slowdown .",
    "the mechanism leading to this acceleration is an effective bias towards unvisited sites .",
    "this bias is not apparent since legs hop _",
    "symmetrically_. yet once the front leg steps onto a new site , it slows down and the hind leg hops to the neighboring site thereby effectively pushing ( due to exclusion ) the front leg further into the unvisited region .",
    "this argument does not fully explain the bias as the hopping processes are stochastic , but it does make the bias plausible . for the bipedal sider with @xmath7 , and more generally for the class of multi - pedal spiders with the maximal span equal to the number of legs ( @xmath176 ) , we computed the bias analytically .",
    "we believe that the bias exists for all spiders ; numerically we confirmed this belief in all cases we looked at , but this is still a conjecture which may be very difficult to prove .",
    "the bias explains the qualitative behavior of the average time @xmath13 , and it suggests that the dual quantity @xmath194 , that is , the average number of sites visited by time @xmath61 , also grows faster than for spiders without slowdown on the new sites .",
    "this quantity is important as it is directly measured in experiments @xcite .",
    "we computed @xmath194 by replacing the spider by an excited walk , that is a walk that hops symmetrically from previously visited sites but biased towards the unvisited region when hopping from new sites . for this excited",
    "walk we calculated not only the average , but the whole probability distribution of the number of visited sites .",
    "the replacement of the spider by an excited walk is , however , not rigorous , but presumably exact due to the perfect agreement with simulations of the spiders .",
    "apart from @xmath13 and @xmath194 , we tried to compute the diffusion coefficient .",
    "numerically we observed that the probability distribution of the spider position approaches a gaussian distribution in the long time limit , and therefore the diffusion coefficient fully characterizes the probability distribution of the spider position .",
    "we neither proved that the probability distribution is ( asymptotically ) gaussian nor computed the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this is an interesting challenge for future work .",
    "finally we note that models of synthetic molecular spiders are closely related to models of natural molecular motors @xcite .",
    "memory effects can occur when motors change their environment , which then affects the motors motion .",
    "( this happens e.g. for the collagenase which moves along collagen fibrils @xcite . )",
    "the non - markovian nature of these situations makes these problems challenging , nevertheless , some problems have been analyzed @xcite .",
    "it should be possible to employ the methods developed here in the context of molecular spiders , and to imply them to the behavior of molecular motors in situations when memory effects are important .",
    "we have a random walk on the integers which hops at rate one to the left , and at rate one to the right .",
    "the walk starts at time @xmath195 from site @xmath54 , where @xmath196 , and site @xmath23 and @xmath60 are absorbing .",
    "we are interested in the first passage probability distribution to reach either site @xmath23 or @xmath60 for the first time .",
    "the position of the walk on the infinite lattice at time @xmath61 is given by @xcite @xmath197 we then do a mirror trick .",
    "we start infinitely many walkers at time @xmath195 from positions @xmath198 , and negative walkers from @xmath199 , where @xmath81 runs over all integers .",
    "now their superposition gives the probability distribution of the walker in the interval @xmath200\\ ] ] since , from symmetry reasons , @xmath201 for all time .",
    "the laplace transform of the position distribution @xmath202 is @xmath203 where we have used shorthand notation @xmath204 hence we have to sum up a geometric series to obtain the laplace transform of @xmath205 the first passage probability to site @xmath23 and site @xmath60 is simply @xmath206 respectively , and the probability to leave the interval at either end is @xmath207 .",
    "we are interested in the @xmath76 , @xmath208 limit , with @xmath209 and @xmath54 being constants .",
    "noting that in this limit @xmath210 we establish the expansions @xmath211 therefore the exit at either side of the interval becomes @xmath212 this asymptotic has been used in subsection [ 1legarea ] .",
