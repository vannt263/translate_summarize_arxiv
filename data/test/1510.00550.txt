    "the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) is a treasury program on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , awarded a total of 590 _ hst _ orbits , carried out in cycles 12 and 13 ( scoville et al .",
    "2007a , 2007b ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2007 ) . in total , a sky area of 1.64 square degree is covered with advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) f814w filter around the central position @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "note that we originally proposed to map a @xmath8  square degree field .",
    "however , due to the observational constraints , the sky area of 1.64  square degree was mapped ( koekemoer et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the subaru cosmos 20 project has covered the whole 2  square degree field .",
    "the comparison between the _ hst _ acs field and the subaru cosmos 20 field is shown in figure  [ fig : field ] .",
    "a point source limiting magnitude is down to @xmath9 ( @xmath10 , 024 diameter aperture ) .",
    "these acs observations provide us a large sample of galaxies with a spatial resolution of 0.1  arcsec covering a redshift range between @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( e.g. , taniguchi et al .",

    ", we also need multi - wavelength data from x - ray , ultraviolet though optical to infrared and radio .",
    "indeed , such multi - wavelength campaign has been made intensively : x - ray ( hasinger et al . 2007 ; elvis et al .",
    "2009 ) , ultraviolet ( zamojski et al .",
    "2007 ) , optical ( taniguchi et al . 2007 ; capak et al .",
    "2007 ) , infrared ( sanders et al . 2007 ) , and radio ( schinnerer et al . 2007 ;",
    "smoli et al .",
    "2012 ) . among them , optical imaging observations made by use of suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) on the subaru telescope ( kaifu et al .",
    "2000 ; iye et al .",
    "2004 ) are highly useful to investigate both photometric properties and photometric redshifts of the galaxies found in the cosmos field ( mobasher et al .",
    "2007 ; ilbert et al . 2009 ; salvato et al . 2009 ) .",
    "in our subaru cosmos 20 project , we used 20 filters in the optical covering from 400  nm to 900  nm : six broad - band ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) , twelve intermediate - band ( ia427 , ia464 , ia484 , ia505 , ia527 , ia574 , ia624 , ia679 , ia709 , ia738 , ia767 , and ia827 ) , and two narrow - band filters ( nb711 and nb816 ) .",
    "this is the origin of the project s name , `` subaru cosmos 20 '' . since we have already given a detailed description on the broad - band and nb816 imaging of the cosmos field ( taniguchi et al .",
    "2007 ; hereafter paper  i ) , we present details of observations , data reductions , calibration , and quality assessment for the twelve intermediate - band filters and nb711 in this paper ( see also capak et al .",
    "2007 ) . as for the nb711 imaging of the cosmos field , see also shioya et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and kajisawa et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . in appendix",
    ", we present a summary of the optical properties of the suprime - cam ia filter system . throughout this paper , we use the ab magnitude system .",
    "the twelve intermediate - band filters are selected from the suprime - cam ia filter set ( hayashino et al .",
    "2000 ; taniguchi et al .",
    "the spectral resolution of all the ia filters is @xmath14 , being just intermediate between typical broad - band filters ( @xmath15 ) and narrow - band filters ( @xmath16100 ) .",
    "therefore , imaging with multi - ia filters is equivalent to low - resolution spectroscopy with an @xmath17 ( see , for example , yamada et al .",
    "it is also mentioned that the use of ia filters makes it possible to detect very strong emission - line objects ( galaxies or active galactic nuclei ) .",
    "although such objects tend to be rare , some examples have been discovered to date : ultra strong emission line galaxies ( usels ) defined as @xmath18   ( kakazu et al .",
    "2007 ) , and green pea objects found in the galaxy zoo project ( cardamone et al . 2009 ) .    since such very strong emission lines in galaxies affect broad - band colors of the galaxies ( e.g. , nagao et al .",
    "2007 ) , careful analyses are recommended to make any sample selection of a particular class of galaxies .",
    "for example , in the case of color selection of very high redshift galaxies at @xmath198 , strong emission line galaxies at @xmath20 with little stellar continuum can act as interlopers ( see taniguchi et al .",
    "2010 ; atek et al . 2011 ) .",
    "on the other hand , such very strong emission line galaxies themselves are important populations , because most of them are very metal poor galaxies ( kakazu et al . 2007 ;",
    "amorn et al .",
    "2014 , 2015 ) .",
    "therefore , surveys of such objects contribute to the understanding chemical evolution of galaxies .    in our subaru cosmos 20 project",
    ", we also use the two narrow - band filters , nb711 and nb816 .",
    "imaging with such narrow - band filters provides us samples of targeted emission line galaxies .",
    "for example , nb816 has been used to find ly@xmath21 emitters at @xmath22 ( e.g. , hu et al . 2004 , 2010 ; shimasaku et al .",
    "2005 ; murayama et al . 2007 ) .",
    "however , the use of nb816 also provides us samples of h@xmath21 emitters at @xmath23 ( shioya et al .",
    "2008 ) and [ o  ii ] emitters at @xmath24 ( takahashi et al . 2007 ;",
    "ideue et al .",
    "2009 , 2012 ) . in the case of cosmos project , nb711 has also been used to sample both ly@xmath21 emitters at @xmath25 ( shioya et al .",
    "2009 ) and [ o  ii ] emitters at @xmath26 ( kajisawa et al . 2013 ) . therefore ,",
    "if we combine imaging surveys with multiple nb filters , we can trace the cosmic star formation history from high to low redshifts ( e.g. , hopkins 2004 ; shioya et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "moreover , multi - band optical imaging such as our subaru cosmos 20 improves the accuracy of photometric redshifts of galaxies ( ilbert et al .",
    "2009 ) and active galactic nuclei ( salvato et al . 2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "the accurate photometric redshifts for the large sample of galaxies allow us to map the large - scale structure at various redshifts and to study the environmental effects of the galaxy evolution ( feruglio et al .",
    "2010 ; scoville et al .",
    "one can also combine such photometric redshifts with a smaller spectroscopic sample to estimate the overdensity of galaxies with high accuracy ( e.g. , kova et al .",
    "2014 ) and to measure the clustering strength of agns ( georgakakis et al .",
    "the cosmos field covers an area of @xmath27 , centered at @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the suprime - cam consists of ten @xmath30  ccd chips and provides a very wide field of view , @xmath31 in @xmath32  pixels ( 0202  pixel@xmath33 ) ( miyazaki et al .",
    "although the field of view of the suprime - cam had been the widest one among available imagers on the 810  m class telescopes before hyper suprime cam on the subaru telescope ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2012 ) , we needed multiple pointings to cover the entire cosmos field .    in our previous suprime - cam observations , we used the two dithering patterns , pattern  a and pattern  c ( paper  i ) .",
    "pattern  a consists of @xmath34  sets ( 48  shots in total ) to cover the whole cosmos field ( see figure  1 in paper  i ) .",
    "this dithering pattern is a half - array shifted mapping method to obtain accurate astrometry and a self - consistent photometric solution across the entire field .",
    "another dithering method is pattern  c that consists of @xmath35  sets ( 36  shots in total ) to cover the whole cosmos field efficiently ( see figure  2 in paper  i ) .",
    "it is noted that both patterns are designed to take care of spatial gaps ( @xmath36@xmath37 or @xmath38@xmath39 ) between the ccd chips of the suprime - cam .",
    "after our previous observations , we confirmed that observations with pattern  c only are enough to obtain accurate photometry and astrometry .",
    "the flat frames generated using only pattern  c in the broad bands are consistent with those created with both pattern  a and pattern  c within 1% root mean square .",
    "therefore , our new observations with the intermediate and narrow - band filters were made by using pattern  c. this made our observations more efficient than our previous observations .        in this paper",
    ", we used twelve intermediate - band filters ( ia427 , ia464 , ia484 , ia505 , ia527 , ia574 , ia624 , ia679 , ia709 , ia738 , ia767 , and ia827 ) and one narrow - band filter ( nb711 ) . note that we intended to use another nb filter , nb921 , whose effective wavelength and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) are @xmath40   and @xmath41   , respectively ( kodaira et al .",
    "2003 ; kashikawa et al . 2004 ; taniguchi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , we did not have enough time to take any nb921 data .",
    "the filter response curves including the ccd sensitivity and the atmospheric transmission are shown in figure  [ filter_response ] for the twelve ia filters and nb711 ( see also section 3.2 for details ) . in figure  [ filter_iabbnb3 ] , we also show those for the 20 filters used in subaru cosmos 20 . in order to see the wavelength coverage fairly ,",

    "the residual background was measured in a grid of @xmath54  pixel squares after masking objects and subtracted .",
    "after the sky subtraction , we calculated an astrometric solution for each ccd chip in all frames using the cosmos astrometric reference catalog .",
    "this catalog was build in 2004 using the megacam @xmath55-band data ( capak et al .",
    "2007 ) , a dataset with bright enough saturation magnitude on individual exposures ( @xmath56 ) to be registered on classical astrometric references , and deep enough ( reaching @xmath57 ) to allow for the registration of all other subaru and acs cosmos data .",
    "the cosmos astrometric reference catalog was build iteratively via the following four steps : 1 ) the astrometric solution for the megacam images was computed using the astrometrix software ( radovich et al .",
    "2001 ) , that was at the time part of the terapix pipeline ( scamp was only introduced in 2005 ) , using the usno - b1.0 catalog ( monet et al .",
    "2003 ) as reference .",
    "2 ) the @xmath55-band catalog obtained from the megacam stack was cross - matched to the cosmos vla pre survey ( schinnerer et al .",
    "2004 ) , and we measured offsets of @xmath58  mas and @xmath59  mas , without any indication of variation across the field .",
    "3 ) the measured offsets were applied to the input usno - b1.0 catalog , and the astrometric solution of the megacam @xmath55-band images was recomputed in the same manner as step  1 .",
    "4 ) the final cosmos astrometric reference catalog was obtained from the @xmath55-band megacam stack produced at step  3 .",
    "the internal accuracy of the cosmos astrometric reference , i.e. , the maximum value of the residual of the astrometric solution derived by astrometrix when fitting the shifted usno - b1.0 catalog is @xmath60  mas and @xmath61  mas , and the absolute offset to the full survey vla astrometry is @xmath62  mas and @xmath63  mas .",
    "all our cosmos 20 images were forced to the cosmos astrometric reference using a 35th order polynomial .",
    "the polynomial order was increased until the astrometric errors were consistent with the seeing size in the data .",
    "the internal scatter of the resulting astrometry is always less than 0.2  arcsec .",
    "we then performed the scattered light correction for the flat as described in capak et al .",
    "the dome and sky flat can be affected by the scattered light at 35% level . the correction factor for this effect",
    "was calculated in each @xmath54  pixel grid so that the background subtracted fluxes of an object at different positions of the detector in the different frames have the same values .",
    "objects in the all frames were simultaneously used in the fitting procedure for each band . in this process",
    ", we also added the additional correction factor for each frame to take account of the effects of the airmass and non - photometric condition .",
    "these correction factors for the scattered light in each region and for the atmospheric condition in each frame were simultaneously determined in the fitting for each band ( equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in capak et al .",
    "thus we made the corrected flat frames and applied them to the object frames .",
    "then the frame to frame offsets of the background - subtracted fluxes of objects were examined as a function of airmass and modified julian date .",
    "if the data followed the airmass trend estimated from the standard star observations within the expected 12% error due to point spread function ( psf ) variation , the data were deemed photometric .",
    "if data stopped following the expected trend , or did not follow it for a night , the data were deemed non photometric .",
    "the non - photometric frames were scaled to the mean of the airmass corrected photometric data .",
    "the frames with extinction greater than 0.5  mag were discarded . in the case of the ia679 band , where no photometric data were obtained ,",
    "all the object frames were scaled to the least extinct frame .",
    "therefore the photometry in the ia679 band should be used with caution .",
    "the flux - matched frames were then smoothed to the same psf fwhm using a gaussian kernel .",
    "after the resampling onto the final astrometric grid , the psf - matched frames were combined with a weight of the inverse variance of each frame , clipping outlier values at more than @xmath10 from the median value in the calculation of each pixel . in this procedure , we also generated a root mean square ( rms ) map that reflects the true pixel - to - pixel rms , which is the value expected if the effects of the resampling and smoothing do not exist .",
    "the rms measured in a given area on this rms map represents the variance that would be measured in the background of the same area if the variance was calculated on the individual images that went into the final mosaiced image .",
    "the psf sizes of final images are summarized in table  [ optical_imaging ] .",
    "in addition to these psf - matched combined images , we also provided the original - psf images for each band from the frames that were not convolved in order to provide a maximum sensitivity for detection of ( compact ) sources .",
    "note that the psf varies as a function of position in these original - psf images , and therefore the color measurements with a relatively small aperture can be less reliable .",
    "these reduced images were divided into tiles with a dimension of @xmath64 as shown in figure  5 of paper  i.    for the color measurements and generating the official multi - band photometric catalog , we additionally convolved the psf - matched combined images to match the psf among all the optical",
    " nir data from @xmath65 to @xmath66 band .",
    "these data were convolved with a gaussian kernel so that the flux ratio between a @xmath36 and @xmath67 aperture for a point source in each band is the same as that of ctio / kpno @xmath66-band data , which have the lowest flux ratio of @xmath68 ( capak et al .",
    "the width ( @xmath69-value ) of the gaussian kernel used in the convolution of the ia and @xmath70-band data is shown in the last column of table  4 . using these convolved data",
    ", we carried out the multi - band photometry with a @xmath36 diameter aperture and the results are presented in the official photometric catalog .",
    "note that the matching of the flux ratio between @xmath36 and @xmath67 apertures for point sources does not necessarily guarantee the same flux ratio for extended sources , because the detailed shapes of the psf are not the same among the different bands .",
    "if one needs to measure colors for extended sources with high accuracy , the photometric values in the official catalog should be used with caution .          since we used the original intermediate- and narrow - band filters in this project , the theoretical synthetic magnitudes of the spectrophotometric standard stars are necessary for the photometric calibration . the theoretical complete system response in each band was computed by multiplying the filter transmission , the subaru telescope mirror reflectivity , the prime focus unit s transmission , the ccd quantum efficiency , and the atmosphere transmission for an airmass of 1.2 . for the atmosphere , we used the same model as the one used for the broad - band suprime - cam filters ( k. shimasaku , private communication ) .",
    "we computed the theoretical synthetic magnitude in the ab system of our standard stars using the available calspec spectra , i.e. , gd50_004.fits for gd  50 , gd108_005.fits for gd  108 , hz4_stis_001.fits for hz  4 , hz21_stis_001.fits for hz  21 and hz44_stis_001.fits for hz  44 ( bohlin 1996 ; bohlin et al .",
    "we present these theoretical magnitudes in the appendix  [ sec : app - b ] .",
    "note that for the hz stars , the calspec spectra have been interpolated between 5150   and 5212   , resulting in a larger overall uncertainty in the calibration of the ia505 and ia527 bands , because this more uncertain region lies on the edges of these two passbands .",
    "these standard stars have been observed at various airmass as mentioned above , and we determined the zero point for each band taking account of the airmass dependence . if @xmath71 are the counts measured from the standard star under an airmass @xmath72 , the relation between the standard magnitude @xmath73 and the zero point @xmath74 is : @xmath75 so that the airmass term @xmath76 is the slope of the expected linear fit to the data of the standard stars and its intercept gives the zero point .",
    "figure  [ fig : standards ] shows typical examples of the calibration for the ia624 and the ia738 bands . for most bands ,",
    "our zero point determination is accurate within 0.02  mag . in a few cases",
    ", there was a lack of standard star observations at high airmass that prevented us to derive the airmass term from the standard star data . in this case",
    ", we used the airmass point of the object data for the zero - point determination . note that for the ia679 band , we obtained no photometric data both for the cosmos field and the standard stars , and we scaled to the photometry of the neighboring bands ( i.e. , ia624 and ia709 ) assuming the objects were flat in @xmath77 for the interpolation .",

    "( 2007 ) , our previous accuracy of photometric redshifts based on six subaru broad band , cfht @xmath86 band , acs f814w , nb816 , and ctio / kpno @xmath66 photometric data is @xmath87 where @xmath88 ; note that @xmath89 and @xmath90 are photometric and spectroscopic redshifts , respectively . since both @xmath86 and @xmath66 are used together with optical data , the accuracy of @xmath89 is better than that of typical optical studies ( e.g. , hogg et al .",
    "however , in the cosmos project , thanks to its multi - wavelength campaign , 30 band photometric data including subaru cosmos 20 data are accumulated to obtain much more accurate estimates of @xmath89 ( ilbert et al .",
    "2009 ; see also salvato et al . 2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath89 is improved to @xmath91 for @xmath92 . even at fainter magnitudes of @xmath93",
    ", the accuracy is found to be still high as @xmath94 for the galaxies at @xmath95 ( ilbert et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "there are several similar surveys with the use of intermediate band filters .",
    "[ 1 ] combo-17 ( classifying objects by medium - band observations in 17 filters ) : this is a pioneering optical survey with multi - band filters ( wolf et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the combo-17 covers three @xmath96 fields , including the extended chandra deep field south ( ecdf - s ) . in this survey",
    ", twelve intermediate - band filters were used together with five broad - band ones ( @xmath65 , @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 ) by using the wide field imager at the mpg / eso 2.2  m telescope on la silla , chile .",
    "their intermediate - band filters cover 410  nm to 920  nm .",
    "the spectral resolution is not fixed for all the filters but ranges from @xmath99 to 61 ( mostly from 30 to 40 ) .",
    "the use of intermediate - band filters improves the accuracy of photometric redshifts to @xmath91 for @xmath100 ( wolf et al .",
    "this enables them to construct a large sample of agns at @xmath1015 .",
    "[ 2 ] musyc ( the multiwavelength survey by yale - chile ) : in this project , 18 intermediate - band filters in the ia filter system for suprime - cam on the subaru telescope were used together with 14 board - band data from optical to mid - infrared ( seven optical filters from @xmath65 to @xmath102 , three near - infrared filters , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , and four spitzer irac bands , 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath106 m ) ( cardamone et al . 2010 ) .",
    "these data cover a @xmath107 field of the ecdf - s , which is one of the musyc fields .",
    "the use of ia filters improves the accuracy of photometric redshifts at @xmath108 to 1.2 and @xmath109 : @xmath110 for @xmath111 , see table  8 in cardamone et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in more detail .",
    "this is attributed that the balmer break ( 3648   ) or lyman break ( 912   ) falls in wavelength interval covered by the 18 ia filters . according to cardamone et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , _ the use of ia filters not only tightens the accuracy of photometric redshifts but also can help to rule out false redshift solution ( so called catastrophic failures)_.    [ 3 ] mahoroba-11 : this survey is a scaled down version of subaru cosmos 20 ( yamada et al . 2005 ) . in this survey seven ia filters are used together with five broad - band filters .",
    "these data cover a @xmath112 area in the subaru xmm - newton deep survey field .",
    "their main purpose is to search for ly@xmath21 emitters at @xmath113 by using a photometric redshift method .",
    "they showed that the fraction of false detection is only 10% .",
    "[ 4 ] alhambra ( the advanced large homogeneous area medium - band redshift astronomilca ) : this survey has been carried out by using the wide - field optical camera , large area imager for calar alto ( laica ) on the calar alto 3.5  m telescope with 20 intermediate - band filters with 300   spacing ( moles et al . 2008 ; molino et al .",
    "the surveyed area size is 2.79  deg@xmath114 .",
    "the accuracy of photometric redshifts is @xmath110 for @xmath115 and @xmath116 for @xmath117 .    in this way , a number of optical wide - field deep surveys have been carried out by using their original intermediate - band filter systems .",
    "the main reason for this is to obtain more reliable photometric redshifts for large numbers of objects in the individual surveys ; see figure  1b in molino et al .",
    "( 2014 ) for a comprehensive comparison among available optical surveys including surveys with broad - band filters only such as hdf , sdss , and so on .",
    "the subaru cosmos 20 is the widest survey among the deep ( @xmath118 ) optical intermediate - band surveys .",
    "some efficient multiple - object spectrographs are available on 8  m class telescopes ( e.g. , vimos on the vlts and fmos on the subaru telescope ) .",
    "however , imaging surveys with intermediate - band filters are more efficient to obtain redshift information for large numbers of objects .",
    "we mention about our future works on study of strong emission - line objects .",
    "the wide imaging with the ia filter set of the subaru cosmos 20 enables us to detect very strong emission - line objects ( star forming galaxies and agns ) over a extremely large volume . in our forthcoming papers , we will present a large sample of ia - excess strong emission - line objects ( kajisawa et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) and a new population of maestlo ( @xmath119 massive extremely strong ly@xmath21 emitters ) at @xmath120 with rest - frame ly@xmath21 equivalent width of @xmath121   and @xmath122 ( taniguchi et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the major cosmos datasets including the subaru images and catalogs are publicly available ( following calibration and validation ) through the web site for ipac / irsa : + * http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu / data / cosmos/*.",
    "the _ hst _ cosmos treasury program was supported through nasa grant hst - go-09822 .",

    "we are deeply grateful to the referee for his / her useful comments and excellent refereeing , which helped us to improve this paper very much .",
    "we would also like to thank the staff at the subaru telescope for their invaluable help .",
    "in particular , we would like to thank hisanori furusawa because his professional help as a support scientist made our suprime - cam observations successful .",
