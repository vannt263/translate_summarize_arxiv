    "the most characteristic feature of the galactic center ( gc ) region in the high energy band is the galactic center diffuse x - ray emission ( gcdx ) .",
    "it has strong emission lines at 6.4 , 6.7 and 7.0 kev which are k@xmath2 lines from neutral , he - like and h - like fe ions , respectively ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "chandra @xcite resolved the gcdx into many faint x - ray sources .",
    "the integrated spectra of the point sources resemble the gcdx in the k@xmath2 line features ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the most probable candidates responsible for the k@xmath2 lines are magnetic cataclysmic variables ( mcvs ) and/or active stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , a significant fraction of the gcdx , if not all , is due to these x - ray point sources .",
    "in fact , chandra , xmm - newton and suzaku have already found several point sources which exhibit characteristic properties of mcvs such as moderate pulse periods and x - ray spectra with the prominent iron k@xmath2 lines ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the equivalent widths of the k@xmath2 lines are smaller than those in the gcdx , and hence the origin of the gcdx is still debatable .",
    "the h.e.s.s . cherenkov telescope revealed that tev gamma - ray sources @xcite and the large - scale diffuse tev gamma - ray emission @xcite are also present in the gc region .",
    "the most plausible scenario of the origin of the tev gamma - rays is interaction of molecular cloud with tev energy protons ( high - energy cosmic rays ) .",
    "the cosmic ray must contain a large number of lower - energy proton , which may produce a k@xmath2 line of neutral iron ( the 6.4 kev line ) by the inner - shell ionization of the iron atoms in the molecular cloud .",
    "accordingly , it is conceivable that the tev gamma - ray emission is associated with the 6.4 kev line .",
    "in fact , @xcite reported possible association of tev gamma - ray source hess j1745@xmath0303 with the 6.4 kev line .",
    "hess j1741@xmath0302 @xcite is one of the faintest unidentified tev gamma - ray sources .",
    "it is located near a relatively powerful radio pulsar psr b1737@xmath030 with the spin - down luminosity of @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 @xcite . in order to search for possible connection between the tev gamma - ray emission and the 6.4 kev line , we observed the region of hess j1741@xmath0302 with the suzaku satellite twice .",
    "we found no x - ray excess from the bright southern emission peak of hess j1741@xmath0302 nor psr b1737@xmath030 .",
    "instead , we discovered a new probable mcv at the close vicinity of psr b1737@xmath030 .",
    "this paper focuses on the discovery and property of the new mcv candidate , and some implications on the origin of gcdx .",

    "one of the fi ccd cameras ( xis  2 ) has been out of function since november 2006 , and hence the data of xis  2 have not been used .",
    "detailed descriptions of the suzaku satellite , the xrt , and the xis can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the xis observations were made with the normal mode .",
    "the ccd integration time is 8 s in this mode .",
    "we used the cleaned xis event data distributed from darts .",
    "these cleaned data were processed with the processing version 2.2.11.22 and 2.2.11.24 for the first and second observations , respectively .",
    "the difference of the processing versions has no significant effect on the results .    in these processes , the data during the epoch of low earth elevation angles",

    "the good exposure times are listed in table [ tab : obs_data ] .",
    "although the xis ccds were significantly degraded by on - orbit particle radiation , the ccd performances were restored by the spaced - row charge injection technique @xcite . using on board calibration sources",
    ", we confirmed the spectral resolutions at 5.9 kev were @xmath8150 and @xmath8200 ev ( fwhm ) for the fi and bi ccds , respectively .",
    "due to a star tracker ( stt ) problem , the suzaku attitude during the second observation was not locked at the programmed position , and hence drifted by @xmath9 in the direction of the right ascension between the start and stop time of the second observation .",
    "the second observation data therefore were not used for the detailed imaging analysis ( section [ ch : image ] ) but were used for the spectral and timing analysis ( section [ ch : spectrum ] and [ ch : timing ] ) after the position correction as described in section [ ch : spectrum ] .",

    ", we used only the data of october 2008 when the stt operated correctly . to increase statistics ,",
    "the data of xis  0 , 1 and 3 were merged .",
    "since the intensity of the non - x - ray background ( nxb ) depends on the geomagnetic cut - off rigidity ( cor ) @xcite , we obtained cor - sorted nxb images using xisnxbgen . after subtracting the nxb image , we divided the x - ray image by a flat - field image to correct vignetting .",
    "the flat - field image was made with xissim @xcite .    since suzaku has non - negligible position errors @xcite , we fine - tuned the coordinate of the xis image using the positions of catalogued visible stars . since x - rays from normal stars are generally soft , we made a 0.5@xmath02.0 kev band image . in the x - ray image , there are three point sources which correspond to catalogued infrared and visible stars , whose positional errors are less than @xmath10 @xcite . to match the positions of the three stars , we simply shifted and rotated the suzaku coordinate without any stretch or shear of the original suzaku image .",
    "the result is shown in figure 1 .",
    "after this fine - tuning , the averaged difference between the catalogued stars and the suzaku position is @xmath11 .",
    "we regard this value as the systematic error .",
    "we then constructed the 1@xmath09 kev band image from the first observation ( figure 2 ) , in which the nxb was subtracted and the vignetting was corrected in the same way as figure 1 .",
    "no significant x - ray emission is found from the radio pulsar psr b1737@xmath030 , but a bright new source is discovered at about @xmath12 east of psr b1737@xmath030 with the fine - tuned position of @xmath13 .",
    "here we designated this source as suzaku  j174035.6@xmath0301416 .",
    "the uncertainties are @xmath14 and @xmath11 due to statistical and systematic errors , respectively .",

    ", the error regions of the three objects overlap with each others , and hence could be the same source .",

    "we therefore divided the data of the second observation into six data sets . in the each data set ,",
    "the attitude drift is less than @xmath22 , which is comparable to the positional uncertainty of @xmath15 .",
    "we made x - ray images from these six data sets respectively and decided the peak positions of suzaku  j174035.6@xmath0301416 in the each data .",
    "we corrected the coordinates of the six data sets to match the peak positions with each others .",
    "then we made positional fine tuning with the same method as section [ ch : image ] .",
    "after these corrections , the spectra and light curves ( section 3.3 ) for the second observation were extracted .",
    "the difference between the fluxes of the first and second observations are less than 5 % and we did not find clear difference between the shapes of the spectra .",
    "we thus combined the spectra of xis of the both observations to increase the statistics .",

    "we suggest that a large absorption for the 64 kev plasma is due to the circum - stellar gas , which could be up to a few @xmath80  @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "this large amount of circum - stellar gas can naturally explain the origin of the strong 6.4 kev line from neutral iron ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum of the standard model with a cylindrical emission region is given by multi - temperature plasma components with power - law emission measure distribution of index @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the multi - components plasma can be approximated by two representative temperatures .",
    "the ratio of the volume emission measures of the 6.0 kev plasma to the 64 kev plasma is 1:2.6 .",
    "this ratio does not follow the power - law relation of @xmath81 .",
    "it is also strange that the 6.0 kev plasma emission does not suffer the large absorption , if that is attributable to the circum - stellar gas .",
    "this new ip seems difficult to be explained with the standard emission model and geometry .",
    "however , the spectra of ips are complex with multi - temperatures , soft blackbody components ( e.g. @xcite ) and hard reflection components ( e.g. @xcite ) so on .",
    "in addition , the spectra depend strongly on spin and orbital phase ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our spectral model is unlikely to be a unique description .",
    "the statistic of this source is , however , not so high , and the detail modeling is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the absorption for the low temperature component , on the other hand , can be interstellar medium to suzaku  j174035.6@xmath0301416 .",
    "the typical absorption to the gc region is @xmath82  @xmath34  ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however this value rapidly decreases as one moves away from the galactic plane .",
    "for example , g359.1@xmath00.5 , a gc supernova remnant located @xmath83@xmath84 away from the plane , has absorption of about @xmath85  @xmath34 @xcite .",

    "assuming the distance to gc as 8  kpc ( e.g. @xcite ) , the absorption - corrected flux of @xmath87  erg  @xmath34  s@xmath5 in the 210 kev band is converted to the source luminosity of @xmath88  erg  s@xmath5 in the 210  kev band , which places suzaku  j174035.6@xmath0301416 as the brightest class of the ip @xcite , and nearly the same order of faint neutron star binaries .",

    "suzaku  j174035.6@xmath0301416 might be one of the most powerful mcvs in the gc region .",
    "ips are , however , well known to be intrinsically absorbed ( e.g. evans & hellier 2007 ) , and thus the measured absorption is not clear to be related to the interstellar absorption .",
    "our estimation of the distance and luminosity should have large uncertainty .",
    "if we assume the luminosity of typical ips , @xmath89@xmath90 erg s@xmath5 @xcite , as that of suzaku  j174035.6@xmath0301416 , the distance estimated to be 0.22  kpc from the observed flux .",
    "we find no excess x - rays from the southern emission peak region of hess j1741@xmath0302 nor from the nearby radio pulsar psr b1737@xmath030 .",
    "we constrain the flux ratio of tev gamma to hard x - ray ( @xmath91 ) to larger than @xmath92 .",
    "@xcite reported that x - ray emission is detected from the northern emission peak of hess j1741@xmath0302 and @xmath91 is @xmath93 .",
    "these large ratios may suggest that hess j1741@xmath0302 is probably a `` dark accelerator '' like hess j1616@xmath0508 @xcite .",
    "unlike hess j1745@xmath0303 @xcite , we find no hint of the 6.4 kev line from the diffuse region of hess j1741@xmath030 or no possible correlation between the gcdx and tev gamma - ray emission , at least for hess j1741@xmath0302 .",
    "on the other hand , our discovery of an ip candidate may give new insight for the origin of gcdx .",
    "as we already note , significant fraction of the iron k@xmath2 lines in gcdx , would be due to mcvs .",
    "however the mean equivalent widths of the 6.4 kev and 6.7 kev lines in the gcdx are @xmath94  ev and @xmath95  ev , respectively ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these are significantly larger than those of suzaku  j174035.6@xmath0301416 , and the other bright mcvs ( @xcite ) .",
    "this statement may be true for the most of the mcvs , which are bright enough to measure the iron lines . to solve this entangled issue",
    ", we need to measure the flux of iron k@xmath2 lines from fainter mcv and/or the other active stars .",
    "the authors thank all of the suzaku team members , especially t. tsuru , m. nobukawa , k. makishima , t. yuasa and m. ishida for their comments and useful information on the xis performance .",
