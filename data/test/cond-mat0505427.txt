    "after almost two decade of intense research about the cuprates , there is still plenty of open questions in this problem .",
    "however , it is recognized that the electrons which move on the @xmath2 planes are the most relevant to describe their physical properties @xcite . in the undoped regime , these compounds are insulators and exhibit antiferromagnetic order at sufficient low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of the insulating phase can be well described by the heisenberg model @xcite . upon doping , these systems",
    "suppress the antiferromagnetic order and become superconductors . in this scenario",
    "there is no doubt that the @xmath3-@xmath3 electron correlations play a fundamental role .",
    "the study of the electronic structure near the fermi level @xmath4 in such strongly correlated systems is very important to understand their physical properties @xcite .",
    "earlier angle - resolved photoemission experiments ( arpes ) have showed the presence of flat bands close to @xmath4 in a region centered around the point @xmath5 in the @xmath6-type cuprates like @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 and @xmath10@xmath11@xmath12 @xcite . due to the presence of strong correlations , to study some physical properties of these cuprate compounds ,",
    "the one - band hubbard model @xcite can be used .",
    "_ @xcite have done monte carlo calculations in the one - band hubbard model .",
    "their results show bands with a flat region near @xmath5 point for a given doping which agreed with the previously mentioned arpes results @xcite .",
    "beenen and edwards @xcite , using the roth s two - pole approximation @xcite in the one - band hubbard model , have studied the normal state of the model obtaining flat quasi - particle bands , which agree well with those found with monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the roth s two - pole approximation has been proposed to improve the hubbard - i approximation @xcite by considering a decoupling scheme which produces an additional energy shift ( the roth s band shift ) in the peaks of the spectral function .",
    "that result is in agreement with those obtained by harris and lange @xcite .",
    "they looked at the moments of individual peaks in the spectral function .",
    "the presence of the exchange term @xmath13 in the roth s band shift exhibits in it a spin dependence . as consequence ,",
    "the roth s method raises the possibility of magnetic solution in the hubbard model while this feature is not present in the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "recently , due to the good agreement between the roth s and the monte carlo data , beenen and edwards have extended the roth s two - pole approximation in order to investigate the superconducting properties of the one - band hubbard model .",
    "their main achievement has been to show the emergence of the pairing with @xmath14 symmetry in a given amount of doping . in that approach , the gap equation for @xmath3-wave",
    "symmetry depends on a particular four operator correlation function which , in principle , can be found extending the roth s formalism to obtain two particle green s functions .",
    "however , the authors have introduced two decoupling schemes to calculate the gap .",
    "the first one ( the factorization procedure ) has been formulated to treat the problem for intermediated values of @xmath15 ( the coulomb interaction ) and it provides an upper estimate for the gap and @xmath16 ( the critical temperature ) .",
    "the second one is adapted for very large @xmath15 scenario which preserves the proper limit for @xmath17 where the gap function vanishes .",
    "nevertheless , the one - band models neglect the presence of the oxygen sites . due to the strong correlations at the @xmath18-sites",
    ", the oxygen sites may be occupied by holes when the system is doped @xcite . for instance",
    ", the hubbard one - band model suffers some limitations to describe the low - energy physical properties of the cuprate superconductors @xcite . in the doped regime",
    ", the one - band hubbard model gives a wrong description of various properties , like , for example , the asymmetric magnetic doping - temperature phase diagram @xcite .",
    "therefore , a model which take into account also the oxygen can be more adequate to treat the cuprate systems in the doped regime @xcite .",
    "this raises the question whether it is possible to extend the beenen and edwards analysis to investigate the @xmath3-wave symmetry superconductivity when the hybridization is present .",
    "recently , the present authors have used the extended hubbard model @xcite with the roth s method to study the role of hybridization in the superconductivity following closely the approach introduced by beenen and edwards @xcite . as discussed in the references @xcite and @xcite , the flattening of the bands is directly related to the band shift .",
    "the presence of flat bands at fermi level @xmath4 in the @xmath6-type cuprates @xcite suggests a high density of states at the fermi level , which can favor pair formation .",
    "therefore , considering that the main responsible elements for the density of states at the fermi level are the @xmath3-electrons , it has been assumed in ref.@xcite that the @xmath19 pairs are the most relevant ones for superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the band shift plays an important role in the study of the superconducting properties of the model using the roth s or some similar procedures . in reference",
    "@xcite , the factorization procedure @xcite has been used to investigate the effects of the hybridization on the superconductivity .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the hybridization has strong effects in the shift and , therefore , in some superconducting physical properties such as the critical temperature @xmath16 . however , as a first approach , in reference @xcite , the band shift has been evaluated taking into account the hybridization effects , but disregarding temperature effects , superconducting properties and , most important , it has been considered in the limit @xmath20 . as a consequence of this limit , many correlation functions , which appear in the shift , are vanished .",
    "the important point is that these correlation functions are very relevant in the sense of to include correctly the hybridization effects .",
    "therefore , it would be necessary to calculate the shift with the @xmath15 finite in order to include the hybridization effects in a more complete way .    in this work",
    ", the superconductivity problem has been studied using the roth s method , following closely reference @xcite , but adapted to the @xmath3-@xmath6 extended hubbard model . here , special attention is devoted to the effects of the hybridization and superconductivity in the band shift . in order to have the effects of the hybridization included properly in the superconductivity , the gap function",
    "is obtained using the factorization procedure @xcite and the shift is evaluated with finite @xmath15 .",
    "this procedure is justified because it preserves some correlation functions present in the band shift , which are non vanishing for finite @xmath15 . as consequence",
    ", it captures the effects of the hybridization properly .",
    "some preliminary results of this approach have been given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are some shortcomings in the beenen and edwards approach @xcite . for instance , the @xmath14 pairing is quite dependent on the choice of the decoupling scheme for the correlation functions related to the gap .",
    "however , in the present work , the main goal is to study the effects of hybridization .",
    "therefore , as discussed in the previous paragraph , the natural choice is the decoupling scheme for intermediated @xmath15 , which is also the simplest one .",
    "one is allowed to find in that procedure , at least , a better estimate for the gap ( and therefore for @xmath16 ) as a function of hybridization within the same decoupling procedure .",
    "the paper presents the following organization . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "it is introduced the model and given a short introduction of the roth s method @xcite .",
    "also , some analytic expressions for quasi - particle bands and the green s functions are derived . in section [ sec:3 ] , the factorization procedure proposed by beenen and edwards @xcite",

    "that is because the fermi function @xmath100 is zero for that range of @xmath225 . as consequence of the shift and the suppression of @xmath220 , the value of @xmath226 , which is given by the integral in eq .",

    "however , from eq .",
    "( [ eq3.8 ] ) , it is necessary a minimum value for @xmath226 to obtain a nonzero solution for @xmath227 .",
    "but , for very strong values of hybridization , the minimum value for @xmath226 is not reached and only the zero solution exists .    according to this analysis , there is a critical value of hybridization ( @xmath228 ) , above which , the superconductivity is suppressed .",
    "similar results , which show a critical value for the hybridization , were also obtained in ref .",

    "@xcite , although the high @xmath229 was not considered , the hybridization effects play an important role for resonant states .",
    "the discussion above is also valid if the values of the temperature @xmath203 are raised with @xmath230 constant .",
    "the only difference is that in this case the fermi function becomes sloping smoothly , changing the product @xmath223 .",
    "the effect of the temperature in the fermi function causes a decreasing of @xmath226 and consequently of @xmath229 .    since the hybridization is directly related to the applied pressure @xcite , the transition temperature @xmath229 may have a dependence on pressure through the hybridization",
    "however , the pressure dependence of @xmath229 is very complicated in high temperature superconductors . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , at least , in conventional superconductivity where the electron pairing is mediated by phonons , two effects are responsible for the pressure dependence of @xmath229 . the first one is related to the lattice vibrations , while the second one comes from the electronic contribution .",
    "as long the pressure is increased , the lattice vibrations tend to increase @xmath229 , whereas the effects of the electronic contribution associated with the hybridization cause a decreases of @xmath229 .",

    "@xcite , where the band shift has been evaluated considering @xmath221 , @xmath208 and @xmath20 ( see table [ tab:1 ] ) .",

    "it is important to highlight that the correlation functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.14 ] ) are both negative .",
    "therefore , for large @xmath15 , the correlation function @xmath234 decreases and the hybridized shift @xmath235 is enhanced .",
    "however , for intermediate values of @xmath15 , both correlation functions remain finite . as consequence , the hybridization effects in the band shift and , therefore , in the superconductivity",
    ", are weakened .",
    "the figures [ fig6](c)-(d ) show the present results when the value of @xmath15 is increased .",
    "the main consequence is , within the factorization procedure , to shift the window of doping where superconductivity is found , as in ref @xcite .    in figure [ fig7](a ) , the chemical potential is show as a function of the total occupation number @xmath231 for @xmath236 and two different hybridizations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors criticized the roth s method because the compressibility @xmath237 is negative in the vicinity of half - filling in the beenen and edwards result . in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using a composite operator approach and imposing the pauli principle , the authors have showed that the compressibility remains negative .",

    "a careful study about the nature of the negative compressibility and the effect of the hybridization near half - filling in roth s approximation has been carried out .",
    "it has been verified that the most important contribution to provide negative compressibility comes from the spin - term @xmath238 present in the @xmath3-part @xmath239 of the roth s band shift @xmath207 ( see eqs .",

    "@xcite , it has been showed that the correlation function @xmath238 plays an important role on the flattening of the quasi - particle bands . the correlation function @xmath238 increases with occupation and its effect is pronounced near half - filling . nevertheless , when the hybridization is present , the numerical results show that it acts in the sense of suppressing the negative compressibility near half - filling . because the hybridization considered here is @xmath194-independent @xcite , the hybridization term @xmath235 of the band shift is constant within the brillouin zone .",
    "its main effect is to shift the poles of the green s functions and consequently to change the value of the chemical potential suppressing the negative compressibility . in figure [ fig7](a ) , it is clear that the effect of the hybridization in the chemical potential decreases the negative compressibility .",

    "this result agrees with those obtained in figure [ fig3 ] , where @xmath219 decreases with increasing of @xmath230 .",
    "in this work , the roth s two - pole approximation is extended to study the superconducting properties of the extended hubbard model given in eq .",

    "moreover , the flat bands obtained with roth s procedure show a qualitative agreement with the arpes experiment data @xcite in cuprates .",
    "it is important to point out that the flattening observed in the quasi - particle bands which produces a peak in the density of states , can be connected with the van hove scenario . in cuprate systems",
    "the van hove singularity is present in the vicinity of the fermi energy .",
    "therefore , it is believed that the van hove scenario play a fundamental role in order to clarify the mechanism which drives the transition to superconductivity in these interesting materials @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the roth s results is very related to the adequate evaluation of the band shift .",
    "therefore , the focus of the present work has been to evaluate the roth s band shift taking into account relevant effects as coulomb interaction , temperature , superconductivity and hybridization .",
    "also , the effect of the hybridization in the superconducting of the model has been studied .",
    "this work has been carried out following the factorization procedure proposed by beenen and edwards @xcite . in order to study superconductivity , beenen and edwards proposed to include hole operators in the original set of operators that describes the normal state of the system .",
    "these operators can introduce the pairing formation in the @xmath3-band . the factorization procedure proposed by beenen and edwards @xcite and the @xmath3-wave symmetry are considered to obtain the gap function amplitude .",
    "the hybridization effects are considered by also including a @xmath6-operator .",
    "thus , the set of operators is enlarged to five , which results in a five - pole approximation to the green s functions .",
    "the hybridization effects present in the band shift come from some correlation functions .",
    "the important point is that part of them vanish when @xmath17 , as it have been done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to consider properly the hybridization effects",
    ", the band shift should be obtained for finite @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , the obtained phase diagrams show that the presence of superconducting order exists in a larger range of doping when compared with the @xmath17 limit @xcite , for the same hybridization .",
    "therefore , this result suggests that , in the @xmath17 limit , the hybridization effects are overestimated .",
    "that is the ultimate justification for the use of the factorization procedure @xcite , which is valid for intermediated values of @xmath15 for the gap function .",
    "the beenen and edwards s @xcite results are recovered taking @xmath218 in the present work .",
    "the hybridization @xmath204 breaks the symmetry between the electron and hole quasi - particle bands , respect to @xmath194 axis .",
    "also , the gap amplitude function @xmath219 and the critical temperature @xmath229 are suppressed with increasing the hybridization @xmath204 .",
    "the results show that the chemical potential does not change significantly away the half - filling .",
