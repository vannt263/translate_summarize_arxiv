    "a double exchange model was introduced in @xcite to describe the motion of conduction electrons in the background of magnetic ions . in its simplest form",
    "the hamiltonian for the model can be written as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the electron annihilation operator on the site @xmath2 of the lattice , @xmath3 is a spin @xmath4 of an electron with implicit summation over repeated spin indices @xmath5 .",
    "] at site @xmath2 , @xmath6 is a core spin .",
    "the first term of ( [ eq : de ] ) describes the hopping of conduction electrons between nearest neighbor sites @xmath2 and @xmath7 of the lattice .",
    "the hopping amplitude is @xmath8 .",
    "the second term is a ferromagnetic hund s interaction between the core spin and the spin of the conduction electron at the same lattice site . to specify the model completely we have to fix the total number of conduction electrons in the sample .",
    "we denote filling factor @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a total number of sites of the lattice . in this paper",
    "we are interested @xcite in the limit of a very strong hund s interaction @xmath11 and of very large core spins @xmath12 . in ( [ eq : de ] )",
    "we did not include any ( bare ) core spin interactions , e.g. , due to superexchange .",
    "the only interaction between core spins in the model ( [ eq : de ] ) occurs through the exchange by conduction electrons .    because of an infinite hund s coupling @xmath13 an electron spin is always aligned with a core spin on any given lattice site .",
    "therefore , the effective hopping amplitude of an electron between two nearest neighbors is the largest when corresponding core spins are parallel . in this case",
    "an electron can hop between lattice sites without changing its spin orientation .",
    "one concludes that conduction electrons induce a ferromagnetic interaction between core spins @xcite .    in the limit of large core spins",
    "@xmath12 we consider one can use an adiabatic approximation and think of core spins as of slow variables so that the conduction electrons ( fast variables ) are always in the ground state in the background of slowly moving core spins .",
    "it is tempting to average over the motion of conduction electrons ( to integrate conduction electrons out ) and obtain an effective spin model describing the dynamics of core spins ( and electron spins ) induced by charge degrees of freedom . in an almost ferromagnetic state",
    "the average spin per lattice site is @xmath14 corresponding to the sum of a core spin and an average electron spin .",
    "therefore , heuristically , one arrives to the model of ferromagnetically interacting _ fractional _ spins .",
    "however , this immediately raises the question of what one means by a fractional spin .",
    "although the average spin per lattice site is fractional , the total spin operator on a given site may take only values @xmath15 ( no electron on the site ) or @xmath16 ( there is an electron on the site ) .",
    "moreover , a fractional value of @xmath17 is incompatible with quantum mechanics of spins ( see section [ sec : singlespin ] ) . resolving",
    "this apparent controversy is a main goal of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "the aim of the section [ sec : singlespin ] is mainly pedagogical .",
    "we establish notations and remind the reader how to write the path integral for a single spin .",
    "we show how the ambiguity of the berry phase for a single spin requires @xmath17 be an integer . for completeness",
    "we derive the berry phase for a single spin in appendix [ app : pathint ] using a fermionic determinant representation for the action .",
    "the reader familiar with the subject can start from the section [ sec : deinfj ] where we consider the double exchange model ( [ eq : de ] ) in the limit @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in section [ sec : de2 ] we formulate a double exchange model on two core spins and obtain our main result  an effective action for core spins induced by a single conduction electron .",
    "this action ( namely , its kinetic part ) answers the question of how to write berry phase for a system of ( two ) fractional spins .",
    "appendix [ app : diagrams ] contains more accurate calculation of the effective action which uses the method of gradient expansion .",
    "we discuss the topology behind berry phase for fractional spins in section [ sec : tabp ] and conclude in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in this section we remind the reader how to write down the path integral for a single quantum spin and discuss topological reasons for spin quantization .",

    "first of all we used an euclidean time representation replacing real physical time @xmath8 by an imaginary time @xmath27 . the change to an imaginary time changes quantum amplitude @xmath28 used in path integral into a `` boltzmann '' factor @xmath29 .",

    "imaginary time representation is slightly more convenient for calculations and for a discussion of topological aspects of spin quantization .",

    "we shall refer to the action ( [ eq : wznw ] ) as to a berry phase @xcite for a spin ( see appendix [ app : pathint ] ) .",
    "although the action ( [ eq : wznw ] ) is given in terms of two - dimensional integral over auxiliary space , the variation of the integrand is a full derivative .",
    "therefore , the variation of berry phase ( [ eq : wznw ] ) is given by a one - dimensional integral over the `` physical '' ( imaginary ) time as @xmath44 we see that the variation of ( [ eq : wznw ] ) does not depend on the choice of an extension of @xmath30 in the unphysical domain @xmath37 . using ( [ eq : variation ] ) one can show that the equation @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a coupling to an external magnetic field gives a classical equation of motion @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "the latter is the equation of precession of spin in magnetic field @xmath48 .",

    "namely , the commutation relations ( [ eq : su2 ] ) can be obtained as a result of quantization @xcite of `` classical action '' ( [ eq : wznw ] ) .      we have already checked that an infinitesimal variation of berry phase @xmath49 $ ] does not depend on the extension of @xmath30 into the auxiliary domain @xmath37 .",
    "how about @xmath50 $ ] itself ?",
    "one can easily show ( see appendix [ app : pathint ] ) that the action ( [ eq : wznw ] ) is equal to @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a solid angle swept by a unit vector @xmath38 during its motion ( see fig.[fig : wznw ] ) .",
    "this angle is not uniquely defined : one can always add or subtract any angle which is a multiple of a full solid angle @xmath53 .",
    "the unit vector @xmath30 draws a closed line on the surface of a sphere with unit radius during its motion in imaginary time .",
    "berry phase is proportional to the solid angle ( shaded region ) swept by the vector @xmath30 .",

    "this `` simplification '' is , however , deceptive because the equation @xmath60 does not define @xmath64 unambiguously .",
    "one can always change @xmath66 with any function @xmath67 satisfying @xmath68 .",

    "we arrive to the same result : the action @xmath72 itself is multivalued while @xmath29 is single - valued under _ the condition _ that @xmath17 is an _ integer number _ !",
    "let us now briefly discuss topological aspects of berry phase ( wznw term ) for a single spin ( [ eq : wznw ] ) .",
    "the classical unit vector @xmath38 from ( [ eq : wznw ] ) takes values on a unit two - dimensional sphere @xmath73  the target space of the problem .",
    "there exists nontrivial expression ( the integrand of ( [ eq : wznw ] ) ) depending on vector @xmath38 and its derivatives which is ( i ) local ( ii ) being integrated over two - dimensional sphere gives integer values for all possible smooth configurations of @xmath38 defined on @xmath73 .",
    "mathematically we say that there exists a closed but non - exact 2-form on @xmath73 ( target space ) or even more formally that the second cohomology group of @xmath73 is @xmath74 .",
    "this allows one to write down the topological term ( [ eq : wznw ] ) where an integration of the mentioned 2-form is performed over a domain @xmath37 with physical time as the boundary of this disk .",
    "the special properties mentioned above guarantee that ( [ eq : wznw ] ) unambiguously defines the path integral ( [ eq : partition ] ) .",

    "we assume that the motion of spins is much slower then the motion of electrons .",
    "this is justified in the limit of large core spins @xmath12",
    ". then one can think of electrons as moving in the background of almost static @xmath64 s",
    ". the second term in ( [ eq : delagrproj ] ) describes the hopping of these electrons with the effective hopping amplitude @xmath91 .",
    "this amplitude is complex number and has both the magnitude and the phase .",
    "the magnitude of the effective hopping amplitude is given by @xmath92 or @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the angle between two core spins .",
    "in this derivation we used a relation @xmath95 and the known identity on pauli matrices @xmath96 .",
    "the absolute value of the effective hopping is proportional to the cosine of the half of the angle between core spins  @xcite .",
    "it is maximal and equal @xmath8 for parallel core spins and vanishes for antiparallel spins .",
    "the phase of the effective amplitude @xmath97 is not defined unambiguously because of the gauge freedom ( see the previous section ) .",
    "consider , however , an electron moving along some closed trajectory in a background of a smooth configuration of core spins",
    ". then along the path we can write @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is small , and @xmath100 .",
    "the product of all the effective amplitudes along the path is @xmath101 , where we use parameterization @xmath102 of @xmath82 in terms of euler angles @xmath103 , and @xmath85 . along the closed path @xmath104",
    ", so only the second term contributes to the phase picked up by an electron .",
    "it is easy to see that this second term is equal to the half of the solid angle enclosed by vectors @xmath38 along the trajectory of an electron .",
    "we see that ( projected ) electrons moving along some closed trajectory acquire the phase equal to the half of solid angle formed by spins along this trajectory .",
    "one can say , therefore , that they `` feel '' the solid angle formed by core spins as a flux of magnetic field .",
    "this flux is ( modulo @xmath105 ) a gauge invariant and well defined quantity .",
    "finally , the last term in ( [ eq : delagrproj ] ) is a `` modified '' kinetic term for core spins .",
    "one might expect that after the averaging over electrons this term will describe the dynamics of effective spins of magnitude @xmath106 .",
    "however , having non - integer coefficient in front of berry phase results in an inconsistent theory .    to make this seeming paradox more precise we average over electrons accurately by integrating fermions @xcite out of ( [ eq : delagrproj ] ) .",

    "there are two main effects produced by an integration over fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "first , the energy of the filled ( to the filling factor @xmath111 ) fermi sea is added to the action .",
    "this leads to an effective ferromagnetic interaction between core spins .",
    "second , the correction to the berry phase of core spins must reflect the fact that spins of conduction electrons are effectively added to core spins .",
    "the latter correction is the matter of consideration of this paper .",
    "the variation of ( [ eq : deeff ] ) over @xmath112 immediately gives @xmath113 , where @xmath114 are some fractional numbers which in general depend on the configuration of core spins ( @xmath82 s ) .",
    "this implies the presence of the term @xmath115 in the action ( [ eq : deeff ] ) and confirms the result we expected from the heuristic `` averaging '' over electrons .",
    "however , the presence of this term alone renders theory inconsistent .    in the next section",
    "we calculate the fermionic determinant of the type ( [ eq : deeff ] ) albeit for a simplified double exchange model on two lattice sites .",
    "we show that there is an additional term present in the effective action for core spins .",
    "this additional term will make the effective theory consistent as it is shown in section [ sec : tabp ] .",
    "the paradox of having fractional spin in the effective action for a double exchange model is present already for a much simpler double exchange model on two lattice sites with a single conduction electron .",
    "in addition the electron spectrum in such model is discrete which makes integration over fermions in adiabatic approximation to be a well - defined procedure .",
    "therefore , in this section we consider the double exchange model on two lattice sites with one conduction electron and show how to resolve the issue of fractional spin on this simple example .    the projected ( @xmath87 ) double exchange model ( [ eq : delagrproj ] ) on two lattice sites ( in imaginary time ) @xmath116    \\nonumber \\\\         & - & t\\left [         \\psi_{1}^{\\dagger}(z_{1}^{\\dagger}z_{2})\\psi_{2 }         + h.c.\\right ] ,    \\label{eq : delagrproj2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 is a euclidean action .",

    "one obtains two effective spins of magnitude @xmath120 instead of bare core spins .",
    "again , we have the problem of having the fractional coefficient in the berry phase term .    we rewrite the lagrangian ( [ eq : delagrproj2 ] ) as @xmath121         + \\psi^{\\dagger}(\\partial_{\\tau}+i\\mu+\\hat{a})\\psi .",

    "this means that neither of three terms considered makes any sense separately from the others .",

    "consider two time independent core spins opposite to each other .",
    "the effective hopping amplitude of a conduction electron is @xmath216 and one has two different configurations .",
    "the electron can be either on the left lattice site or on the right one ( see figure [ fig : oppspins ] ) and the matrix element of the hopping term is zero between those states .",

    "the charge degree of freedom ( left or right position of the electron ) is essential for this particular configuration of core spins and can not be integrated out . in our derivation",
    "we used an adiabatic approximation and neglected such configurations .",
    "this is justified in the limit @xmath12 for ferromagnetically interacting core spins .",
    "however , this approximation drastically changes the topology of the system . essentially , we prohibited the configurations @xmath194 . the relevant target space changes from @xmath212 for two independent spins to @xmath217 .",

    "@xmath12 one can think of electrons and core spins as of fast and slow degrees of freedom respectively .",
    "the superficial averaging over the fast motion of electrons leads to an inconsistent theory with effective fractional spins . using the example of the double exchange model on two lattice sites we showed that in addition to the change of the value of the effective core spin on site from @xmath15 to @xmath231 a new topological term arises in the effective action . with this term",
    "the exponent of the effective action becomes single - valued and well defined .",
    "we showed that the full berry phase ( [ eq : kin ] ) reflects the change of topology of the system which occurs due to the adiabaticity condition  the condition justifying the averaging over the charge degrees of freedom .",
    "the generalization of our results to the double exchange model for many spins is relatively straightforward .",
    "the only major difference with the case of two spins is that the average occupation number of a given lattice site by conduction electrons depends on the configuration of core spins .",
