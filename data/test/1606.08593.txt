    "the physics of hadrons began about one century ago , when it became appealing to build nuclei from protons and neutrons .",
    "the experimental search for the neutron was soon resumed along with the search for the particle predicted by yukawa as being responsible for the tight binding of protons and neutrons .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for the history of this early period .",
    "when interacting with nucleons or among themselves , the pions produce many resonances .",
    "the exchange of meson resonances , and the formation of nucleon resonances in the intermediate states are crucial for our understanding of the nuclear forces beyond the single - pion exchange proposed by yukawa .",
    "for instance , the existence of the vector mesons , nowadays known as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , was somewhat anticipated from the need for isospin - dependent spin - orbit components in the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "see , e.g. ,  @xcite for an introduction into the early literature on this subject .",
    "the discovery of numerous meson or baryon resonances stimulated intense efforts to understand the underlying mechanisms that generate the hadrons .",
    "for instance , the @xmath0 meson can be described as a @xmath2 resonance in a @xmath3-wave , with the @xmath4-wave counterpart being the scalar meson responsible for the spin - isospin averaged attraction observed in nuclei . in 1955 ,",
    "chew and low described the @xmath5 as the result of a strong @xmath6 interaction @xcite , and today , the scattering of pions off nuclei is still pictured as series of @xmath7-hole formation and annihilation .",
    "an ever more ambitious picture was proposed , called `` nuclear democracy '' or `` bootstrap '' , in which every hadron consists of all possible sets of hadrons compatible with its quantum numbers  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , neither the models based on nucleons and pions as elementary bricks , nor the bootstrap , succeeded in providing an overall picture .",
    "for instance , the degeneracy of isospin @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , does not emerge naturally , if one assumes that their content is dominated by the nucleon - antinucleon component  @xcite .    from the very beginning",
    ", the attention was focused on hadrons with properties that look unusual , in contrast to the regularity patterns of the rest of the spectrum .",
    "the exotic character of a hadron is of course a time - dependent concept : once a striking property of a hadron is confirmed by further measurements , and understood within a plausible theoretical framework , the hadron ceases to be exotic .    among the most famous examples , there is the @xmath10 meson , a peak of mass 1.02gev with a remarkably small width of about 4mev @xcite , decaying preferentially into a pair of kaons , though the decay into pions is energetically much easier .",
    "the decay patterns of the @xmath10 are now understood from its quark content @xmath11 , where @xmath4 denotes the strange quark , with very little mixing .",
    "the suppression of the internal annihilation of @xmath11 into light mesons has been codified in terms of the so - called `` zweig rule '' , eventually justified from the asymptotic - freedom limit of quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the process took , however , several years , and was not mature enough when the @xmath12 particle was discovered at the end of 1974 ; it is a meson of mass about 3.1gev and width much less than 1mev  @xcite .",
    "why the @xmath12 was not immediately identified with @xmath13 ?",
    "the great surprise was that the zweig rule works too well !",
    "as compared to the @xmath14 , the @xmath12 is three times heavier , so its phase - space for decay into light mesons is considerably larger , and yet its width is smaller ! for the @xmath15 , the effect is even more pronounced , but when the @xmath15 was discovered in 1977  @xcite , the lesson was learnt , and the @xmath15 was never considered as exotic .    today , any attempt to provide with a definition of an `` exotic '' hadron starts from the quark model .",
    "a meson with quantum numbers that can not be matched by any spin - orbital state of a quark and an antiquark is obviously exotic .",
    "states with unusual properties but ordinary quantum numbers are named `` crypto - exotic '' states . in particular",
    ", ordinary baryons can reach any set of values of the spin - parity @xmath16 with half - integer spin @xmath17 and parity @xmath18 , so a baryon can not be exotic except for its flavour content .",
    "a consensus has thus been reached that a hadron is exotic if it can not be understood as mainly made of quark - antiquark nor quark - quark - quark , but `` mainly '' remains vague . while simple quark models will propose a reference with a frozen number of constituents , more advance pictures include an expansion in the fock space , with additional quark - antiquark pairs in the wave function .",
    "the hope is that the expansion converges , and that a clean separation emerges between exotic and non - exotics .",
    "this review is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ se : mesons ] , we shall review states with unusual properties in the light ( sec . [ sse : mesons - light ] ) , open heavy - flavour ( sec .",

    "[ se : multibaryons ] .",
    "the various theoretical models will be reviewed in sec .",
    "[ se : theory ] , with some emphasis on string dynamics and potential models .",
    "some limits have to be set .",
    "the case of light hadrons will be just outlined , to focus more on the most recent states containing heavy quarks or antiquarks . in the former sector ,",
    "the literature is enormous , and can be traced back from the conference proceedings that will be cited in the next sections , from some well - known reviews such as @xcite , or from study groups for future facilities @xcite .",
    "for the recent exotics with hidden charm , there exists already excellent and even comprehensive reviews , such as @xcite .",
    "our aim here is not to compete with these reviews , nor to duplicate them , but rather to discuss critically the recent findings and the models that they inspired .",
    "so , this paper will be more subjective .",
    "hopefully , it will trigger some discussion , and , perhaps , attract newcomers into the field , where innovative ideas are welcome .    the bibliography for such a subject can not be comprehensive .",
    "some past review articles are cited , which give access to the early papers .",
    "we apologise in advance in the event where some important contributions are inadvertently omitted .",
    "there are many hot issues on light mesons : why are the pseudoscalars so light ? what is the status of the many scalar mesons ?",
    "why ideal mixing and zweig rule work so well in some sectors , and not in other sectors ?",
    "we refer , e.g. , to @xcite for a critical survey of the claims for exotics , and to  @xcite for a thorough discussion within qcd and the bibliography , and to the last hadron conferences for an update @xcite .",
    "one of the puzzles arises from the @xmath19 , measured in several experiments , in particular at l3 @xcite : the comparison of the different charge modes suggest a sizeable isospin @xmath20 contribution .",
    "there are interesting theoretical studies on the production mechanism @xcite , but missing is a simple understanding of why there is strong attraction in that channel in terms of quark dynamics .    there is an intense activity in the search of glueballs and light hybrids , either as supernumerary states with ordinary quantum numbers @xmath21 , or as genuine exotics with @xmath21 that can not be matched by ordinary quantum numbers . in particular , evidence has been found for @xmath22 states between 1 and 2gev@xmath23 by ves at serpukhov@xcite , by e852 at brookhaven @xcite , and by compass at cern @xcite , and the search is resumed actively , in particular by gluex at jlab @xcite . for a thorough review of the other contributions , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the charmed mesons @xmath24 , @xmath25 have been discovered shortly after the charmonium , and the mesons with charm and strangeness @xmath26 , @xmath27 have followed . relevant for this review on exotics",
    "are the so - called @xmath28 states . as summarised in @xcite , the @xmath29",
    "was discovered at babar @xcite and the @xmath30 at cleo @xcite , with a mass remarkably lower than predicted in the `` bible '' @xcite and in similar quark - model calculations .",
    "note that the tuning of the spin - dependent forces in such models has been often debated , and no consensus has ever been reached , see , e.g. , @xcite . to explain the low mass and the properties of the @xmath31 states , the coupling to the nearby @xmath32 thresholds certainly plays a role .",
    "these mesons have even been considered as molecules , for instance , in  @xcite .",
    "after , the discovery of charm , it has been early recognized that configurations including both light and heavy quarks or antiquarks might be particularly interesting , for instance , in the case of baryon - antibaryon or multibaryon systems  @xcite .",
    "another pioneering contribution was due to isgur and lipkin @xcite who considered the flavour exotic @xmath33 configuration .",
    "shortly after , even more exotic mesons were studied , @xmath34 , with two heavy quarks and two light antiquarks . as explained later in this review , their existence is a prediction shared by many theorists using different approaches , which will be discussed in the next sections",
    ". doubly - heavy exotics , which are surprisingly omitted in some `` reviews '' on multiquarks , have not yet been searched for in any experiment , but will be one of the goals of future experiments , and several theorists estimated the rate of production at hadron @xcite or electron @xcite colliders , or in the decay of hadrons with beauty  @xcite .",
    "the production of two charm - anticharm pairs is somewhat disconcerting , with the good surprise of a rather abundant production of double charmonium , leading for instance to the identification of the @xmath35 recoiling against the @xmath12 @xcite , and , on the other hand , the double - charm baryons have not been confirmed in recent experiments , see sec .",
    "[ sse : baryons - open2 ] .",
    "the spectrum is quarkonia , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , is now rather well known and well understood . for a while ,",
    "the most delicate experimental sector was the one of spin - singlet states , such as @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "for instance , a first candidate for the @xmath40 was announced about 300mev below the @xmath12 , triggering some premature announcements on the quark dynamics , but eventually replaced by a more reasonable @xmath40 about 112mev below @xmath12 , see , e.g. , the reviews  @xcite . a first indication for the @xmath41 was given a by @xmath42 formation experiment at cern @xcite , with another indication in a similar experiment at fermilab @xcite .",
    "it was eventually firmly identified at cleo @xcite .",
    "the @xmath35 was seen at belle in @xmath43 decay @xcite and in double - charmonium production @xcite .",
    "it also took some time until the spin - singlet states of @xmath37 were identified  @xcite .    above the threshold , @xmath44 for charmonium and @xmath45 for bottomonium , the spectrum was known to be more intricate , with broader peaks , and an interplay of @xmath4- and @xmath46-states mixed with the @xmath47 continuum , and it was a somewhat a daily grind to improve the measurements .    then came the shock of the discovery of the @xmath48 by belle @xcite , in the @xmath49 mass spectrum of the reaction @xmath50 . neither the mass nor the decay properties were according to the expectations of the charmonium models , in particular for the @xmath51 level . on the other hand ,",
    "such a state was announced in the molecular models , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sse : molec - xyz ] .",
    "not only the experts on quark- or hadron - dynamics commented this new state , but also some non - experts became attracted to the subject .",
    "as well summarised in a recent review @xcite , a second shock was the discovery of the @xmath52 by babar  @xcite , in @xmath53 with isr .. ] this @xmath54 sector of charmonium was already thoroughly explored , with radial excitations , with @xmath4- and @xmath46-waves mixed between them and with the continuum .",
    "so this new state was immediately associated with an exotic , or , say crypto - exotic structure .",
    "the @xmath52 was seen also at cleo and belle  @xcite .",
    "a third shock was the discovery of charged states , with minimal content @xmath55 or c.c .",
    "the first announcement was the @xmath56 by the belle collaboration , in the @xmath57 mass distribution of the decay @xmath58",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is hardly possible to list all the states of @xmath59 or @xmath60 type without duplicating the very comprehensive reviews such as @xcite .",
    "let us stress a few points :    * the @xmath61 and @xmath62 have been seen in double - charmonium production @xcite , which gives a clear signature of their @xmath13 content , * some states have been seen in @xmath63 , indicating a charge conjugation @xmath64 , and very likely @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "this is the case for @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xcite . *",
    "some states , in particular among the above ones , are just candidates for radial excitations of charmonium .",
    "if confirmed , they indicate the supernumerary character of other states sharing the same quantum numbers .",
    "* the @xmath70 has been seen as an enhancement in the @xmath71 spectrum of the isr reaction @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "many references about this state can be found in a recent paper  @xcite . as stressed in this literature",
    ", the decay into a baryon and an antibaryon might indicate a `` baryonium '' type of structure , though other scenarios have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "* there is sometimes a clustering of states with similar masses",
    ". it might the same state with a peak that depends on the production and decay process .",
    "* most quark models and , to a lesser extent , molecular models predict an isospin @xmath9 partner of the @xmath8 state , analogous to @xmath0 vs.  @xmath1 .",
    "this stimulated searches for charged partner , such as @xcite .",
    "* while the @xmath48 has been seen in many experiments , @xmath52 in a few experiments , some states have been seen in just a single experiment . in between ,",
    "@xmath73 has been seen by belle and  @xcite , but these experiments share many collaborators , and used the same reaction @xmath74 , with a slight variant for the confirmation by cleo @xcite .",
    "so , the negative result of a search by compass in photoproduction is particularly important for the existence or at least the coupling properties of this state  @xcite .",
    "* the lightest @xmath75 states have minimal quark content @xmath76 , where @xmath77 . in several models ,",
    "their @xmath78 with hidden strangeness are expected .",
    "recently , the lhcb collaboration re - analysed the @xmath79 mass spectrum from the decay @xmath80",
    "@xcite , and found evidence for @xmath81 and @xmath82 both with @xmath83 , in disagreement with some models ( cited in @xcite ) and in partial or full agreement with others , in particular the extension by stancu @xcite of the chromomagnetic model proposed for the @xmath48  @xcite . *",
    "the models somewhat differ about the existence and location of the @xmath84 analogues of the exotic mesons with hidden charm : the heavier @xmath85-quark mass , for instance , suppresses the chromomagnetic effect but enhances the chromoelectric ones , while the coupling schemes are sensitive to the gap between bare quarkonia and meson pairs .",
    "the list of candidates is rather scarce for the time being , and are due to belle only .",
    "the charged @xmath86 and @xmath87 have been seen in @xmath88 , where @xmath37 stands here for some lower @xmath89 or @xmath90 or @xmath91 .",
    "later , belle also got some candidate for the neutral @xmath92 . on the other hand ,",
    "a search for the heavy partner of @xmath48 , decaying into @xmath93 or @xmath94 , has been so far unsuccessful .",
    "the history of the quark model is intimately linked to baryon spectroscopy .",
    "one of the motivation for su(3 ) flavour symmetry , nowadays denoted su(3)@xmath95 , was the observation that the hyperons have properties similar to that of non - strange baryons .",
    "the quark model was developed first in the baryon sector , with the pioneering works by greenberg , dalitz , etc . , and pushed very far by the subsequent works by dalitz et al .",
    ", hey et al . , isgur and karl , and many others .",
    "for a review , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "obviously , the field has been much enriched by the study of baryons with charm or beauty , and baryons carrying two or three heavy flavoured quarks are eagerly awaited .",
    "there are many issues there , that have been presented in conferences such as `` baryons '' , `` nstar '' , etc . for years",
    ", one of the most striking issues was the signature for the `` symmetric quark model '' with two degrees of freedom , vs.  the quark  diquark model .",
    "clearly , the recent progress , as e.g. , summarised at the recent conference in tallahassee @xcite , confirms the existence of states such as @xmath96 which can not be accommodated in a naive quark - diquark picture with a frozen diquark .",
    "the lightest state with an excitation in each of the jacobi variables , say , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , has isospin @xmath99 , spin @xmath100 and orbital momentum and parity @xmath101 . in the particular case of the harmonic oscillator",
    ", its wave function reads @xmath102 and is antisymmetric under the permutations .",
    "thus , if associated with an antisymmetric colour wave function @xmath103 and an antisymmetric spin - isospin wave function , it fits perfectly the requirement of fermi statistics .",
    "note that an antisymmetric spin - isospin wave function is possible for @xmath99 ( @xmath104 ) , but not for @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) nor @xmath8 ( @xmath107 ) .    experimentally , the search for doubly - excited baryons is difficult . as often underlined ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) photon or meson scattering off a nuclear target favours the production of states with a single quark being excited . and in amplitude analyses , doubly excited baryons , if any , come in a region that is already well populated !",
    "another hot issue is the roper resonance , an excitation with the same quantum numbers as the ground state . in potential models , this is mainly a hyper - radial excitation , but in explicit model calculations , it is found higher than the negative - parity excitation , while the experimental roper state lies degenerate or even slightly below the lowest negative - parity excitation .",
    "chiral dynamics , as implemented in specific models or in lattice simulations , accounts for this property , which sets limits to naive potential models .      here , again , is the problem of missing states , with slow but continuous progress to fill the holes .",
    "a very striking property is the low mass of the @xmath108 , discussed first by dalitz @xcite and now in an abundant literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent summary ) . in the case of the nucleon spectrum , the spin - orbit splittings , such as between @xmath109 with @xmath110 and @xmath111 with @xmath112 ,",
    "are very small , and isgur and karl , for instance , have set the spin - orbit potential to zero in their fit @xcite .",
    "hence the large @xmath113 splitting of the strange analogues appears as somewhat a surprise in a pure quark model .",
    "a minimal solution explains the discrepancy by a shift due the coupling to the nearby @xmath114 threshold .",
    "similarly , the @xmath115 is shifted down by the nearby @xmath44 threshold , and the hyperfine splitting @xmath116 is slightly smaller than expected .",
    "similarly , the @xmath117 state of charmonium gets some admixture of @xmath118 in conservative models of the @xmath48 , etc .",
    "now , a more appealing solution is also suggested , in which there are two poles with @xmath119 near @xmath108  @xcite , a mixing of a @xmath120 molecule and a quark - model state .",
    "as often underlined in the case of mesons @xcite , the mixing scheme might be more involved than in ordinary quantum mechanics , with the absorptive part , i.e. , the coupling the decay channels , playing the major role .      for years",
    ", there has been debates about baryons carrying positive strangeness . in the 60s and 70s ,",
    "much effort was devoted to exploit the analyticity properties of the @xmath121-matrix , and to reconstruct the amplitudes from the scattering data .",
    "this program was rather successful in the case of the @xmath6 and @xmath120 reactions , and led to the identification of a number of baryon resonances with strangeness @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "the case of @xmath124 scattering with @xmath125 was much more delicate and controversial .",
    "some early analyses , based only on differential cross - sections ( and just a few data on the recoil polarisation ) , suggested the possibility of resonances , see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "the resonances were named @xmath126 or @xmath127 , where @xmath8 or @xmath128 is the isospin .    then came data on the analysing power , obtained using a polarised target , as in @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the uncertainties were narrowed @xcite , and the @xmath60 resonances tended to fade away . for years , the particle data group ( pdg ) , summarised the state of art , as in the 1980 edition @xcite , where one finds candidates for several exotic baryons with @xmath125 .",
    "there are @xmath129 and @xmath130 in the isospin @xmath8 sector , and @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath9 .",
    "then the @xmath60 baryon disappeared from the review , and the letter @xmath60 was given to another particle .",
    "note that other risky amplitudes analyses were done later , for instance for @xmath134 or @xmath135 before the advent of data taken on the polarised target , or for the elastic @xmath42 scattering with just data on the polarisation , while the simpler @xmath136 case notoriously requires several spin observables .",
    "act two of the play is better known .",
    "meanwhile the name `` pentaquark '' was introduced in the anticharmed sector , as will be discussed shortly , in sec .",
    "[ sse : antich - baryons ] .",
    "it reflects that the minimal content of the @xmath126 baryon is @xmath137 .",
    "in 2003 , nakano et al .  found a narrow peak in the @xmath138 distribution of the reaction @xmath139",
    "this state , named @xmath140 , was predicted in a model by diakonov et al .",
    "@xcite based on some developments of the chiral dynamics .",
    "it was of course rather remarkable to have a relatively small experiment revealing a major discovery .",
    "but the sequels quickly went out of control .",
    "on the theory side , a flurry of papers , with hasty calculations and ad - hoc assumptions . on the experimental side , some collaborations discovered that they had data on tape , that were never analysed , and contained in fact the pentaquark !",
    "other positive results came , both for the @xmath141 , and for other members of the anti - decuplet of su(3)@xmath95 that was predicted .",
    "however , the trend became inverted , and experiments with better statistics and particle identification did not confirm the existence of the these light pentaquarks .",
    "this is reviewed for instance in @xcite .",
    "the theory part also came under better scrutiny . in ref .",
    "@xcite , some lattice qcd calculations following the discovery of the @xmath141 are criticised . in , e.g. , @xcite ,",
    "some inconsistencies are pointed out in the estimate of the width in the model of diakonov et al .",
    ", a crucial property of the putative light pentaquark .      in the last 20 years , much experimental progress has been done in the sector of baryons with single charm or beauty .",
    "when available , the comparison of @xmath85- and @xmath142-baryons is compatible with the idea of a flavour - independent confinement .",
    "for instance , the first evidence for @xmath143 came from d0 at fermilab , with a mass about @xmath144mev , corresponding to a double - strangeness excitation @xmath145 substantially larger than its charm analogue .",
    "further measurements by cdf at fermilab and lhcb at cern gave a mass around @xmath146 in closer agreement with the expectations @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of charmed baryons is their narrowness , with , e.g. , @xmath147mev for @xmath148 , @xmath149mev for @xmath150 , @xmath151mev for @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "of course , this gives a better view on the spectrum than in the case of overlapping resonances .",
    "an optimistic columnist of pdg @xcite even stated : ``  models of baryon - resonance spectroscopy should now _ start _ with the narrow charmed baryons , and work back to those broad old resonances . '' among the current discussions , there is the suggestion that @xmath153 is mainly a @xmath154 molecule @xcite .",
    "the same narrowness is observed for @xmath85-baryons , as listed in the latest pdg review @xcite or revealed in the latest lhcb papers @xcite .",
    "thirty years ago , double charm baryons were considered as just a straightforward extension of the quark model , to be checked just for the sake of completeness . at",
    "most , some experts stressed the co - existence within the same hadron of the slow , adiabatic , charmonium - like motion of the two heavy quarks , and the fast , @xmath24-meson - like motion of the light quark around them . in the literature",
    ", @xmath155 is often described as a quark - diquark @xcite ; however , the first excitations occur between the two heavy quarks and thus one has to introduce `` excited diquarks '' .",
    "an alternative is the born - oppenheimer method @xcite , which , as discussed later , might also be adequate in the @xmath75 sector and for hybrids .",
    "some evidence for double - charm baryons was found at fermilab , in the selex experiment @xcite , but unfortunately not confirmed in other experiments at fermilab or elsewhere @xcite .",

    "double - charm baryons will certainly receive more attention in the near future @xcite .",
    "it is an important question to understand why double - charm baryons have not yet been seen .",
    "if the golden modes such as @xmath156 or @xmath157 are suppressed , the detection scheme should be revised . and ,",
    "perhaps , new production mechanisms should be exploited .",
    "our ability to detect double - charm baryons and measure their properties is eagerly watched by people waiting for exotic tetraquarks and dibaryons .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the binding and the correlation of the two charmed quarks in @xmath155 gives some idea about @xmath158 and @xmath159 . and , in most production experiments , they share the same triggers , so that a simultaneous search for double - charm baryons , mesons and dibaryons can be envisaged .      two simultaneous papers by gignoux et al .  and lipkin @xcite , in which the word `` pentaquark '' was first used , suggested the existence of stable or metastable states @xmath160 with @xmath161 denoting @xmath162 , @xmath163 or @xmath164 .",

    "the anticharmed pentaquark was initially one the goals of the compass experiment @xcite , but it has disappeared from the agenda .",
    "this is one of the latest findings , inducing an intense phenomenological activity supplementing the discussions about @xmath75 mesons .",

    "needless to say , lqcd faces difficulties as qcdsr , for the study of multiquark states . in the early days",

    "of course , some additional attraction such a scalar - isoscalar exchange between the two @xmath248 can restore the binding .",
