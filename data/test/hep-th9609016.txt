    "it has long been known that there is an @xmath0 supermultiplet which , with respect to @xmath1 supersymmetry , appears as a combination of one vector and one chiral multiplet @xcite .",
    "this supermultiplet is irreducible under @xmath0 supersymmetry and carries vanishing central charge .",
    "it is usually referred to as the vector supermultiplet .",
    "not long after its introduction , it was realized that there exists a variant , the vector - tensor multiplet , which , under @xmath1 supersymmetry , appears as a combination of one vector and one linear multiplet @xcite .",
    "this variant is irreducible under @xmath0 and , in contrast , carries non - vanishing central charge off - shell . on shell",
    "it is equivalent to the vector multiplet .",
    "this multiplet was originally constructed using component field techniques @xcite , and it and its properties have received little attention . recently , however , within the context of trying to understand the consequences of @xmath0 duality in superstrings , the vector - tensor multiplet has re - emerged . specifically , when heterotic string theory is reduced to an @xmath0 theory in four dimensions the dilaton and the antisymmetric tensor field lie in a vector - tensor multiplet @xcite .",
    "it is clear from this work that the vector - tensor supermultiplet is fundamental in heterotic theories and that elucidation of its properties , such as its behavior under duality transformations , is of importance .",
    "the coupling of the vector - tensor multiplet to supergravity has also recently been considered @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this requires the gauging of the central charge , leading to a chern - simons coupling between the vector - tensor multiplet and a vector multiplet .",
    "if one wants to fully understand the complete , off - shell structure of the tensor - vector multiplet , one powerful approach is to construct the appropriate @xmath0 superfield .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to provide such a formulation .",
    "much of the interesting structure of the vector - tensor multiplet appears in its couplings to other multiplets @xcite . here , however , we will restrict ourselves to a superfield formulation of the free abelian case , leaving interacting generalization to future publications .",
    "since the vector - tensor supermultiplet has non - zero central charge , it is necessary to expand the usual superspace .",
    "the maximal central extension of the @xmath0 superalgebra has two central charges .",
    "consequently the corresponding superspace has two extra bosonic coordinates @xcite .",
    "working in this superspace , one can introduce superfields and covariant constraints .",
    "following the geometrical formulation of supergauge fields , we introduce a super - connection and the associated curvature .",
    "we then introduce the appropriate constraints , solve the bianchi identities and show how the component fields of the tensor - vector multiplet emerge . using superspace techniques we rederive the supersymmetry and central charge transformations and , after showing that there exist a lagrangian superfield in central charge superspace , the higher components of which are all total derivatives",
    ", we give the superfield and component actions .",
    "the existence of a superfield lagrangian is an example of a central - charge generalization of the superactions described in @xcite .",
    "it suggests that there is an even - dimensional submanifold of the central charge superspace naturally associated with the vector - tensor multiplet .",
    "central charge superspace has recently also been considered in @xcite and used to rederive the usual gauge supermultiplet .",
    "also , we want to point out that there is a strong relationship between the theory of @xmath1 supersymmetry in six dimensions and four - dimensional , @xmath0 central charge superspace . indeed , the superfield equations of motion in the six - dimensional theory motivated the choice of one important constraint equation in four - dimensional central charge superspace .",
    "in this sense , our constraint can be understood as a superfield realization of the dimensional reduction by legendre transformation discussed in @xcite .",
    "we start by briefly recapitulating the relevant formulae of @xmath0 superspace . throughout the paper",
    "we will use the conventions of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 supersymmetry algebra is obtained from the poincar algebra by adding four fermionic operators @xmath2 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and their anti - hermitian conjugates @xmath5 .",
    "moreover the algebra admits one complex `` central charge '' @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are hermitian .",
    "these operators satisfy the following anticommutation relations : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the four - momenta and @xmath11 .",
    "the automorphism group of algebra is @xmath12 where the @xmath13 acts on the @xmath14 index in @xmath2 .",
    "the antisymmetric tensor @xmath15 with @xmath16 provides an invariant metric for raising and lowering the @xmath13 indices by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath0 superspace is a space with coordinates @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are commuting bosonic coordinates while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are anticommuting fermionic coordinates .",
    "a superfield @xmath25 is a function of the superspace coordinates , @xmath26 .",
    "taylor - series expansion of a general superfield @xmath25 in the @xmath27 coordinates terminates after a finite number of terms due to the anticommuting nature of @xmath27 . on the other hand",
    ", the expansion in @xmath21 and @xmath28 never ends .",
    "this means there are an infinite number of component fields ( functions of the spacetime coordinates @xmath20 ) in a general superfield .",
    "this infinite number of component fields can be reduced to a finite number either off - shell , by applying appropriate constraints , or on - shell , by choosing equations of motion which propagate only a finite number of component fields .",
    "translations in the superspace are generated by the supercovariant differential operators @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the anticommutation relations for these operators .",
    "they are @xmath34 by construction @xmath35 and @xmath36 anticommute with @xmath37 and @xmath38 and so can be used to impose supersymmetric covariant conditions on superfields .",
    "the supervielbein @xmath39 of the @xmath0 superspace is defined as the matrix that relates the supercovariant derivatives @xmath40 and the ordinary partial derivatives @xmath41 the matrix @xmath42 is the inverse of @xmath39 .",

    "the torsion @xmath43 is defined as the exterior derivative of the supervielbein one - form @xmath44 , @xmath45 the non - vanishing components of the torsion are found to be @xmath46",
    "in this section we give a geometrical superfield formulation of the vector - tensor multiplet .",
    "we begin by considering the usual geometrical form of super - gauge theory , though in superspace with central charge .",
    "we then find a suitable set of constraints on the superfield strength to reproduce the field content of the vector - tensor multiplet .",
    "restricting our attention to abelian gauge theories , let us introduce a hermitian connection @xmath47 .",
    "the hermiticity of the connection implies @xmath48 where @xmath49 is real , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the curvature two - form is defined as @xmath52 the coefficient functions @xmath53 comprise thirteen lorentz - covariant types .",
    "the ones that contain torsion terms are given by @xmath54 the curvature tensor @xmath55 is subject to the bianchi identities @xmath56 or equivalently @xmath57 each tensor component of the curvature tensor is an @xmath0 superfield which , in turn , has an infinite number of component fields .",
    "all but a finite number of these component fields must be eliminated by virtue of appropriate constraints .",
    "these constraints must be lorentz , gauge , and supersymmetric covariant .",
    "it is natural to adopt a set of constraints which set the pure spinorial part of the curvature tensor to zero . that is @xmath58 before imposing further conditions",
    "we would like to explore the consequences of . to do so we must solve the bianchi identities subject to these constraints .",
    "the result is that all the components of the curvature tensor @xmath59 are determined in terms of a single superfield @xmath60 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath61 .",
    "henceforth , we denote these superfields by @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in particular @xmath64 and @xmath65 furthermore , @xmath62 is constrained to satisfy @xmath66 }   = - \\epsilon^{\\dot\\alpha\\dot\\beta } \\bar d_{\\dot\\alpha}^{[i } \\bar   w_{\\dot\\beta}^{j ] } , \\label{3 } \\\\ & \\epsilon^{\\alpha\\beta } d_\\alpha^{(i } w_\\beta^{j ) }   = \\epsilon^{\\dot\\alpha\\dot\\beta } \\bar d_{\\dot\\alpha}^{(i } \\bar   w_{\\dot\\beta}^{j)}. \\label{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us explore the consequences of  on the field content of @xmath62 .",
    "the expansion of @xmath62 in the anti - commuting coordinates has the general form @xmath67 it is obvious that conditions  will not impose any restriction on @xmath68 .",
    "first we consider the implications of the lowest component of superfield constraints . condition implies that @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "the equations  are the general solution of the bianchi identities subject to our constraints .",
    "three of the bianchi identities they satisfy are @xmath82 taking the lowest component of equation gives rise to @xmath83 so that @xmath84 is the field strength of a gauge field @xmath85 .",

    "this is as far as we can go using solely the constraints .",
    "so far we have the following component fields : an @xmath13 doublet of spinors @xmath89 , a real gauge field @xmath85 , a complex vector field @xmath90 , a real scalar @xmath78 and a real @xmath13 triplet of scalars @xmath91 .",
    "we would like to impose further constraints to reduce the number of fields to an irreducible multiplet .",
    "as we will show very shortly , it is possible to impose further constraints to ensure that the real and imaginary parts of @xmath90 are each field strengths , one of an anti - symmetric tensor and the other of a scalar .",
    "what about the fields @xmath78 and @xmath91 ?",
    "we will find that @xmath78 and @xmath91 play the role of auxiliary fields .",
    "note that the usual @xmath0 gauge multiplet has a triplet of auxiliary fields .",
    "hence , if we want to derive the usual gauge multiplet we are led to set @xmath78 to zero by promoting the constraint to the stronger one @xmath92 } = 0 , \\qquad    \\epsilon^{\\dot\\alpha\\dot\\beta } \\bar d_{\\dot\\alpha}^{[i } \\bar   w_{\\dot\\beta}^{j ] } = 0.\\ ] ] on the other hand , if we want to derive the vector - tensor multiplet , which has a single auxiliary field , we must eliminate @xmath91 .",
    "this can be achieved by promoting condition to the stronger condition @xmath93 henceforth , we add condition as a further constraint on the theory .",
    "now let us proceed using conditions  as well as the stronger version of , constraint .",
    "apart from eliminating @xmath91 , it can be shown that the consequences of imposing are @xmath94 we note that the conditions obtained so far on @xmath90 given in and are not sufficient to render the real and imaginary components of @xmath90 as field strengths .",
    "we would like , therefore , to impose yet another , and final , constraint that will achieve this goal .",
    "we take a reality condition on the central charge @xmath95 this means that superfield @xmath62 , and hence all the curvature tensor components , depend on the two central charges @xmath21 and @xmath96 only through the combination @xmath97 with no dependence on @xmath98 .",
    "substituting from constraint into and immediately gives the following constraints on the real and imaginary components of @xmath90 @xmath99}^i = 0 . \\label{t5}\\ ] ] these equations achieve just the goal we were aiming for .",
    "they assert that @xmath100 and @xmath101 are field strengths of an anti - symmetric tensor and a scalar field respectively .",
    "that is @xmath102 in conclusion , we find that the component fields in @xmath62 are exactly those of the vector - tensor multiplet , namely @xmath103 . it will not have escaped the readers notice that these fields are actually functions of the central charge coordinates as well as the spacetime coordinates . however , by virtue of constraint , they depend on the central charge coordinates only via @xmath104 .",
    "let us introduce a real central charge coordinate @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , the dependence of these fields on @xmath106 is highly restricted by the conditions we derived so far .",
    "in fact , as we now show , these conditions completely determine their dependence on @xmath106 in terms of their lowest component in their central charge expansion . to see this",
    "let us summarize the relevant conditions in , , and derived on the bosonic fields .",
    "they are @xmath107}^r . \\end{split } \\label{t4}\\ ] ] equations constitute a system of first - order `` differential equations '' for the @xmath108 dependence of the bosonic fields .",
    "the general solution is completely determined in terms of the `` initial conditions '' ; that is , the values of the fields at @xmath109 , say , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "thus in a taylor series expansion in @xmath106 each term in the series gets related to lower - order terms , so that for instance , @xmath113 with similar formulas for @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , in the next section , we will derive the corresponding equation for the fermionic field @xmath68 .",
    "in this section , we would like to derive the supersymmetry and central charge transformations of the component fields . in order to exhibit these transformations",
    "it is necessary to compute the part of @xmath62 quadratic in the fermionic coordinates .",
    "moreover , since all the component fields are present in the lowest and first order terms of @xmath62 , the quadratic term is sufficient for computing the supersymmetry transformations .",
    "we have @xmath114 let us first consider the constraint equations , , and .",
    "demanding that the linear term in @xmath27 in these equations vanish completely determines @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "we find @xmath118 we note that these terms do not involve any new fields .",
    "they are completely given in terms of the lowest component of @xmath62 , namely @xmath68 .",
    "we are still left with equation which is a reality condition . evaluating the linear term in , and making use of , yields the following constraint on the fermionic field @xmath68 @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "equation is the relation for the fermionic field @xmath121 corresponding to equations for the bosonic fields .",
    "it fixes the expansion of @xmath68 in the central charge @xmath106 , leaving only the lowest component @xmath122 arbitrary .",
    "we are now in a position to compute the supersymmetry transformation of the different component fields .",
    "to do this we have to act on @xmath62 with @xmath123 we find @xmath124 }   + 2 \\xi_\\alpha^i d   + \\tfrac{i}{3 } \\bar\\xi^{\\dot\\alpha i } { { \\smash{{\\sigma}^{a}}_{\\alpha\\dot\\alpha } } }   \\epsilon_{abcd } \\partial^b b^{cd } - 2 { { \\smash{{\\sigma}^{a}}_{\\alpha\\dot\\alpha } } }   \\bar\\xi^{\\dot\\alpha } \\partial_a \\phi . \\end{split } \\label{susy}\\ ] ] note that the fields in these supersymmetry transformations are formally functions of both @xmath20 and @xmath106 .",
    "we have already shown that the only independent components of these fields are the lowest order terms in @xmath106 .",
    "further , transformations do not mix component fields from different orders in @xmath106 .",
    "thus equations also express the variations of the lowest - order independent fields , which are functions of @xmath20 only .    to get the central charge transformations we have to act with @xmath125 on @xmath62 .",
    "it is straightforward to get the following set of transformations @xmath126 expressions and reproduce the supersymmetry and central charge transformations of the vector - tensor multiplet given in the component field calculations of @xcite .",
    "they are a realization of the @xmath0 supersymmetry algebra with central charge .",
    "note that as a result of our constraints , in particular , only one of the two central charges is represented nontrivially .",
    "we now discuss how to write a superfield action for the vector - tensor multiplet .",
    "we start by noting that the relevant field strengths of the different bosonic fields occur at the linear level in @xmath62 . to get a quadratic expression in these field strengths",
    ", we have to consider expressions quadratic in @xmath62 .",
    "these expressions can contain both @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "contracting the indices to get a proper lorentz invariant lagrangian implies that there must be an even number of @xmath78 s .",
    "in such an expression , the relevant terms will occur at @xmath127 level if it involves no derivatives or the lowest component if it involves two derivatives . in the former case we will have to integrate over two @xmath27 s only .",
    "but in contrast to the chiral space for @xmath1 supersymmetry , there is no two - dimensional subspace of the @xmath0 superspace over which supersymmetry is represented .",
    "hence , we are forced to consider expressions quadratic in @xmath62 with two supersymmetric covariant derivatives , and to integrate over spacetime only .",
    "in fact , we find that the free lagrangian for all the component fields is contained in the lowest component of @xmath128 to be precise , we have @xmath129 it is straightforward to verify that lagrangian is invariant under supersymmetry transformations up to a total divergence .",
    "although this implies that it must be invariant under central charge transformation as well , since the latter is equivalent to two successive supersymmetry transformations , one can check directly that it is indeed invariant under up to a total divergence .",
    "this invariance of the lowest component of the lagrangian under central charge and supersymmetry transformations , in fact , implies that the higher components are spacetime total divergences . to show this",
    "let us consider first the invariance under central charge transformation . since the lagrangian transforms by a total divergence under a single central charge transformation , it must does so under @xmath130 such transformations .",
    "that is @xmath131 put another way , all the coefficients in the @xmath106 expansion of @xmath132 but the lowest one are , in fact , spacetime total divergences .",
    "therefore we have @xmath133 although a little involved we can extend this proof to the expansion in @xmath27 as well .",
    "that is , it can be shown that @xmath134 we would like to stress that this is completely general .",
    "if the lowest component of a superfield is supersymmetric invariant up to a spacetime total divergence , all the higher components in @xmath106 as well as @xmath27 are spacetime total divergences .",
    "this has the immediate consequence that a spacetime integral of this superfield will single out the lowest component . in other words",
    "we can write down the following superfield expression for the invariant action @xmath135 this represents a central charge generalization of the type of superactions considered in @xcite .",
    "this completes our study of the superfield formulation of the vector - tensor multiplet .",
    "we conclude by briefly mentioning the connection between the superspace formulation of the vector - tensor multiplet and @xmath1 supersymmetry in six dimensions . the presence of central charge led us to augment @xmath0 superspace by two new bosonic coordinates , @xmath21 and @xmath96 .",
    "the resulting space , with six bosonic coordinates , is actually none - other than the superspace of @xmath1 supersymmetry in six dimensions ( though with the fermionic coordinates treated slightly unconventionally , being formulated as a pair of @xmath13 majorana - weyl spinors @xcite ) .",
    "the introduction of a connection @xmath136 in the central charge superspace then mirrors the formulation of supersymmetric gauge theory in six dimensions .",
    "in fact our first set of constraints are precisely those used for the six - dimensional vector multiplet @xcite . to obtain the vector - tensor multiplet we imposed two further constraints .",
    "the first condition still has a six - dimensional interpretation : it corresponds to the on - shell condition for the six- dimensional vector multiplet .",
    "it is important to note that this does not imply that the multiplet is on - shell in four - dimensions .",
    "instead it implies a relationship between the derivatives of the component fields in the internal @xmath21@xmath137 directions and in the four - dimensional @xmath138 directions , as shown in equation .",
    "the second condition breaks the six - dimensional lorentz symmetry .",
    "it forces the superfield to be independent of one of the internal @xmath21@xmath137 directions .",
    "as we have shown , together these conditions are sufficient to completely determine the dependence of the multiplet on the central charge coordinates .",
    "the connection to the component formulation of the vector - tensor multiplet given by sohnius _",
    "@xcite now also becomes clear .",
    "the second condition is a conventional dimensional reduction of the six- dimensional vector multiplet down to five - dimensions .",
    "the first condition , corresponding to an on - shell condition in six- dimensions , reproduces the `` dimensional reduction by legendre transform '' from five to four dimensions .",
    "a superspace formulation of the vector - tensor multiplet allows a number of further issues to be addressed .",
    "first is the question of duality . on shell , the usual vector multiplet and the vector - tensor multiplet",
    "describe the same degrees of freedom . from the @xmath1 point of view , one is the dual of the other since the chiral multiplet in the usual vector multiplet is dual to the tensor multiplet in the vector - tensor multiplet .",
    "central charge superspace should provide a realization of this duality in a manifestly @xmath0 supersymmetric way .",
    "a related question is to find an unconstrained @xmath0 prepotential for the vector - tensor multiplet .",
    "we also note that the form of the multiplet described here has been explicitly non - interacting .",
    "however , the superspace formalism also allows the description of non - abelian multiplets as well as multiplets with gauged central charge and chern - simons terms as have been discussed in components in @xcite .",
    "it is also pertinent to the discussion of the most general form of the action for the vector - tensor multiplet .",
    "finally the central charge superspace can be used to give a superfield description of other exotic @xmath0 multiplets , in particular the tensor and double - tensor multiplets mentioned in @xcite .",
    "we leave the discussion of these issues to future publications .",
