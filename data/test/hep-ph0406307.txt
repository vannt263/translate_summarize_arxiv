    "the conditions that the discriminant @xmath79 has a local minimum value give the resonance conditions for neutrino oscillation . in our analysis , it is expected that the resonance of @xmath216 and @xmath215 occur at @xmath222 and @xmath223 , respectively , for @xmath224 .",
    "this results can be confirmed by the previous calculations @xcite in 2- , 3- and 4-neutrino models , respectively .",
    "for instance , the surviving probabilities @xmath211 for 4-neutrino oscillation is given as @xmath225 ,    \\label{eq : transitionnuenue}\\ ] ] where @xmath226 is a factor determined by the mixing matrix and the characteristic equation of the matter hamiltonian in mass basis@xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath227 is a baseline length which stands for the neutrino flying distance .",
    "[ fig : pexe010gl10000 km ] is a result of the recalculation of the transition probabilities for new conditions which we have used in this paper .",
    "one can find that the value of the matter density @xmath71 that the resonance occurs in fig .",
    "[ fig : dne010 g ] coincides with the value of @xmath71 that the sharp drop of the transition probabilities occurs in fig.[fig : pexe010gl10000 km ] .    is the condition to observe the neutrino resonance realistic ?",
    "the electron matter density @xmath71 is @xmath228 at the center of the sun .",
    "the average of the electron matter density in earth is about @xmath229 @xcite . in the case of @xmath224",
    ", it may be possible to observe the resonance between @xmath56 and @xmath212 since the condition is @xmath213 which corresponds to the density of the earth .",
    "but in other analysis it may be difficult to observe the resonance .",
    "one may consider that the resonance will occur in the high energy and low matter density , which is restricted by ( [ eq : resonanceconditon2nugeneral ] ) .",
    "but there is a limit of the neutrino energy to observe the neutrino oscillation . from ( [ eq : transitionnuenue ] ) , the baseline length @xmath227 to observe the neutrino oscillation and the average @xmath55 of the neutrino energies are proportional to each other .",
    "for instance , the condition to observe a neutrino transition @xmath230 for @xmath231 and @xmath232 is @xmath233 and @xmath234 , respectively , where we assume the condition @xmath235 then , we have considered that the neutrino oscillation can be observed when the neutrino flying distance is more than @xmath236 , which @xmath237 corresponds to the wavelength in ( [ eq : transitionnuenue ] ) .",
    "the 3-neutrino model with a small and bi - maximal mixings and the 4-neutrino model will be tested more closely by the upcoming experiments . in this paper ,",
    "the resonance conditions for 2- , 3- , and 4-neutrino mixings are given without a preconception .",
    "our result of the resonance conditions , which are given by using the discriminant , does not deny the possibility of the 4-neutrino oscillation , but the observation of the resonance is not realistic .",
