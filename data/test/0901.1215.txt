    "a number of astronomical observations , such as type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy @xcite , and the large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite , have shown that the expansion of our universe is accelerating .",
    "the acceleration of the universe strongly indicates the existence of a mysterious exotic matter , named dark energy , which has negative pressure and takes the largest proportion of the total density in the universe .",
    "the ultimate fate of our universe is to be determined by the dark energy , yet we know little about its properties .",
    "furthermore , while both the dark matter and the dark energy is commonly thought to interact weakly with ordinary matter , it is not immediately clear whether there is some interaction between the two , or if the two are in some way linked .    in this paper",
    "we consider the dark matter - dark energy interaction in the framework of the holographic dark energy ( hde ) model @xcite .",
    "the basic ideas of the hde model are based on the holographic principle @xcite , which was inspired by the bekenstein entropy bound of black holes@xcite . in this model , the dark energy",
    "is related the quantum zero - point energy density @xmath0 , the total energy of the whole system with size @xmath1 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , thus we have @xmath2 .",
    "the largest infrared cut - off @xmath1 is chosen by saturating the inequality so that the hde density is @xmath3where @xmath4 is a numerical constant , and @xmath5 is the reduced planck mass . if we take @xmath1 as the size of the current universe , for instance the hubble scale @xmath6 , then the dark energy density estimated with eq.([holo - density ] ) will be close to the observed value .",
    "however , hsu @xcite pointed out that this yields a wrong equation of state for dark energy .",
    "li @xcite subsequently proposed that the future event horizon might be chosen as the ir cut - off @xmath1 , and viable hde models can then be constructed . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hde scenario may help to answer the _ fine tuning problem _ and the _ coincidence problem _ of dark energy .",
    "various aspects of the hde model and its extensions have been investigated subsequently .",
    "for example , it has been generalized to the case of non - flat universe @xcite , and it was studied from the perspective of the anthropic principle @xcite .",
    "the holographic dark energy was also considered for driving the inflation , and its resulting power spectrum index calculated @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite defined a new future event horizon as the infrared cut - off @xmath1 and found that the coincidence problem could be alleviated to some extent .",
    "@xcite investigated the possible form of the cut - off scale @xmath1 for the solution of coincidence problem .",
    "inspired by the hde model , ref .",
    "@xcite proposed the ricci scalar curvature radius as @xmath1 .",
    "the model was reconstructed with a scalar field @xcite .",
    "observational constraints have also been studied @xcite .",
    "the growth of density perturbations in the holographic dark energy models has been studied in @xcite .",
    "interactions between the de and dm components were considered for the hde model @xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite suggested that for the @xmath7 case , with interactions between the two dark components , the dark energy could acquire an equation of state in agreement with observations , thus partly solving the no - acceleration problem noted in ref.@xcite for interaction - free models .",
    "ref.@xcite generalized the discussion in ref.@xcite to the case of a future event horizon . in that paper",
    "the proposed form of interaction is @xmath8 , which could also lead to a negative dark energy equation of state .",
    "however , ref.@xcite pointed out that the interaction terms such as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 all lead to unphysical results , because the dark matter density could be driven to a negative value in these models .    here",
    "we propose a form of interaction which we considered _ natural _ and _ physically plausible_. in general , when two types of matter interact with each other , the interaction should be proportional to the product of the powers of the number density of both .",
    "this is most easily understood in the following way : if one component does not exist , then there certainly would be no interaction at all ; with its amount increasing , the interaction rate should increase .",
    "thus , at least in the diffuse limit , the interaction rate should be proportional to some powers of the density ( the relation could become more complicated when the densities become high ) .",
    "for instance , this is the case for ordinary two - body chemical reactions , namely @xmath12i.e .",
    "the reaction rate is proportional to the product of number densities of the two particle species .",
    "however , besides the interaction in the usual sense ( `` scattering '' ) , one may also consider a more general case where the dark energy is converted to dark matter or vice versa by `` annihilation '' or `` decay '' .",
    "in such a case , the `` interaction term '' or more precisely the energy exchange term would depend only on one of the densities and not on the other .    in general",
    ", we consider the interaction term to be proportional to some powers of the density , @xmath13@xmath14 in which @xmath15 and @xmath0 are the energy densities of the matter and hde respectively , and @xmath16 is a parameter with mass dimension @xmath17}^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the power index @xmath18 is assumed to satisfy @xmath19 where if one of them is 0 , we will have the case of `` decay '' ( if the other is 1 ) or `` annihilation '' ( if the other is 2 ) .",
    "if @xmath20 , the interaction suggests that dark energy is converted into dark matter , while @xmath21 suggests the inverse process .",
    "this form of interaction was considered in the study of coupled quintessence model @xcite .",
    "however , not much research on this form of interaction was carried out to understand how such a coupling term would affect the evolution of the universe .    in the next section ,",
    "we present the evolution equations for the interacting holographic dark energy model ( details of our derivation are given in the appendix ) . in sec .",
    "3 , we study the dynamical behavior of the model . in sec.4",
    "we explore the parameter space and find the best - fit and allowed region of @xmath18 . finally , concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "now let us consider a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe filled with matter component @xmath15 , hde component @xmath0 and the radiation @xmath22 . for simplicity we do not distinguish dark matter and ordinary matter below but incorporate both in the matter component @xmath23 .",
    "it is certainly possible or even likely that dark energy only couples to dark matter .",
    "however , in that case the baryons simply evolve as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the scale factor , the baryon component would then become dynamically irrelevant as the universe expands , so it only affects the details of the model but not its qualitative behavior , hence we will neglect this effect in the present paper .",
    "the friedmann equation reads @xmath26where @xmath22 is the energy density of the radiation which satisfies @xmath27 .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( [ holo - density ] ) , ( [ dark matter ] ) , ( [ dark energy ] ) , ( [ friedman1 ] ) are the dynamic equations which uniquely determine the evolution of @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in eq.([holo - density ] ) , @xmath1 could be hubble horizon @xmath6 , particle horizon and future event horizon , i.e. @xmath33or @xmath34we define the following dimensionless quantities : @xmath35,@xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the current critical density , and @xmath39 , and introduce @xmath40 the dimensionless @xmath41 parameter determines the characteristic strength of the interaction .    the equations of motion of the hde model for the particle ( event ) horizon cases are @xmath42,\\notag \\\\ \\frac{de(z)}{dz } & = & \\frac{1}{2(1+z)}\\left[3e(z)+\\frac{(\\tilde{\\rho}_{r}-\\tilde{\\rho}_{\\lambda } ) } { e(z ) } \\pm \\frac{2 \\tilde{\\rho}_{\\lambda } ^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{c\\cdot e^{2}(z ) } -\\frac{\\lambda ( e(z)^{2}-\\tilde{\\rho}_{r}-\\tilde{\\rho}_{\\lambda } ) ^{\\alpha } \\tilde{\\rho}_{\\lambda } ^{\\beta } } { e(z)^{2}}\\right ] ,   \\notag \\\\ w_{\\lambda } ( z ) & = & -\\frac{1}{3}\\pm \\frac{2}{3}\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho}_{\\lambda } ^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{c\\cdot e(x ) } -\\frac{\\lambda } { 3}\\frac{1}{e(x)}\\left[e(x)^{2}-\\tilde{\\rho}_{\\lambda } -\\tilde{\\rho}_{r}\\right]^{\\alpha } \\tilde{\\rho}_{\\lambda } ^{\\beta -1 } ,   \\label{event case}\\end{aligned}\\]]in which the upper(lower ) sign represents the case of particle(future event ) horizon ( c.f .",
    "the appendix for details of derivation ) .",
    "it is easy to verify that if @xmath1 in eq.([holo - density ] ) equals the particle horizon @xmath43 or hubble horizon @xmath6 , the model can not fit the current observational data , because current data prefer the dark energy with equation of state near @xmath44 , while in the above two cases the equation of state @xmath45 will be always greater than @xmath46 ( see also the analysis in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in the following we will focus on the interacting model with @xmath47 ( see eq.([event case ] ) ) .",
    "in this section we study the dynamical behavior in models with interaction between de and dm , which may give rise to some interesting behaviors .",
    "first we consider the case where @xmath18 are fixed to be 1 , then consider the more general cases .    as a typical example we consider the model with @xmath48 , which happens to be the @xmath49 model which best - fits the current data ( for details of the fitting procedure see next section ) .",
    "first we plot the evolution of densities of different components in fig.rho .",
    "while one might think that the coupling between de and dm might help resolve the coincidence problem , we find that for these particular parameter values the evolution of different densities is rather similar to that of the standard @xmath50 model , i.e. the dm and de densities could still differ by orders of magnitude , so it does not seem to help much in this case .",
    "rather , as in other hde models , the fine tuning problem could be alleviated : the density of the dark energy is associated with the scale of horizon rather than the planck scale , due to the holographic principle .",
    "we have also investigated cases with larger coupling constant @xmath41 .",
    "we find that indeed , for the strong coupling case ( @xmath51 ) , the dark matter and dark energy could be made to evolve with comparable density for an extended range of redshifts , thus in some sense solving the `` coincidence problem '' .",
    "this is perhaps also true for any strongly coupled dark matter - dark energy model .",
    "however , for strong coupling the fit to observation is not good .        to investigate how the dynamics of the components are affected by coupling with the other component",
    ", one may compare the expansion term @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) with the interaction term @xmath54 .",
    "if the interaction term is greater than or comparable with the expansion term of both of the components , the two components are strongly coupled and evolve together .",
    "as the universe expands , typically the density of the component would drop as @xmath55 , the interaction term often drops much more rapidly than the expansion term . when the expansion term of a component is much greater than the interaction term",
    ", that component evolves almost freely , and we may say the two components are decoupled .",
    "the coupling and decoupling effects between the two components could be asymmetric , as each has its own expansion term .",
    "it is possible that for one component the expansion term is greater , so it is decoupled from the other component , but for the other component , its expansion term is still smaller than or comparable with the interaction , thus it is still coupled to the other component .         in fig .",
    "[ compbest ] , we compare the expansion term of the dark energy and the dark matter with the interaction term as a function of redshift . in the left panel ,",
    "we plot the magnitude of the dark energy expansion term @xmath56 , and in the right panel , we plot the magnitude of the dark matter expansion term @xmath57 , as red solid lines .",
    "the interaction term @xmath58 is plotted in both panels for comparison with the expansion terms . in the early universe , the dark matter takes a greater proportion of the total density , and for dark energy the interaction term is comparable with the expansion term , so the dark energy is moderately coupled to the dark matter .",
    "later , as the density of dark matter is diluted by expansion , the interaction term becomes negligible compared with the expansion term , and the dark energy is decoupled from dark matter . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ compbest ] , we plot the dark matter expansion term @xmath59 and interaction term @xmath60 as a function of redshift @xmath61 .",
    "we see that throughout the cosmic history , for the dark matter the expansion term is always greater than the interaction term , so the dark matter is at most weakly coupled to dark energy .",
    "however , at lower redshifts , the difference becomes larger , and the dark matter become further decoupled from dark energy .",
    "such a decoupling history is quite typical for many interactions .",
    "however , there could also be some quite unexpected and interesting behavior in the presence of dark energy . in fig .",
    "[ couple ] , we make plots similar to fig .",
    "[ compbest ] but for the model with @xmath62 , and this model is chosen to illustrate such an unusual behavior . in this model , because @xmath63 , the dark energy density actually increases at later time .",
    "we see from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ couple ] , since initially the dark matter density is greater , that the interaction term is comparable to the expansion term for dark energy .",
    "however , later on the dark energy becomes dominant , and the interaction term falls below the expansion term of dark energy , so we may say that dark energy becomes decoupled .",
    "however , more interestingly , from the right panel of the figure , we see that initially the interaction term of the dark matter is smaller than the expansion term , so the dark matter is only weakly coupled to dark energy , but at later time , the interaction term is comparable with the expansion term of dark matter , so the dm becomes coupled to de .",
    "this is the reverse of the familiar decoupling process , which we shall call _",
    "incoupling_. this strange and interesting behavior could only occur when a component is coupled to dark energy , whose density does not decrease during the cosmic expansion . as the de keeps being converted into dm , the dm evolution",
    "is greatly affected by de .",
    "this model does not yield a good fit to the observational data , but is only used to illustrate an interesting dynamical behavior in the presence of @xmath63 dark energy .    in fig.[hubble ] , we plot the evolution of @xmath64 for three choices of @xmath4 parameter , i.e. the best fit @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , while keeping @xmath67 .",
    "the hubble parameter for the @xmath68cdm model is also plotted for comparison .",
    "we also plot the equation of state of the dark energy for these models in fig .",
    "[ eos1 ] . on the left panel",
    ", curves for different @xmath4 but identical @xmath41 are plotted ; on the right panel , curves for identical @xmath4 but different @xmath41 are plotted . in all of these models ,",
    "the phantom divide @xmath69 is either crossed , or will be crossed in the near future . the dark energy density would keep increasing , the interaction with dm would not slow it down , as the dark energy has become decoupled to the dm .",
    "eventually a `` big rip '' would occur .",
    "the current value of the equation of state @xmath70 for the best - fit model @xmath71 is around @xmath72 , which is within the @xmath73 cl region of @xmath70 in the wmap 5-year resultswmap5 , suggesting that this model is consistent with the current observations",
    ".        the value of @xmath41 in these models does not significantly affect the fate of the universe , but it does greatly affect the past evolution .",
    "this result is easy to understand ; as the dark energy dynamically decouples from dark matter , the interaction become negligible , regardless the precise value of coupling constant .",
    "the eventual fate of the universe in this interacting holographic dark energy model is qualitatively similar to those without interactions , though the details of the evolution would be different .",
    "thus , as in the case of non - interacting holographic models , for the fate of the universe , @xmath74 leads to phantom - like behavior and big rip@xcite , while @xmath75 leads to quintessence behavior .",
    "this is very different from the models discussed in ref .  @xcite . for further discussions on the fate of the universe and big rip singularity in our model",
    ", see appendix b.    we now consider the more general case of @xmath76 .",
    "we plot the equation of state in fig .",
    "[ eos2 ] , varying @xmath77 in the left panel while keeping @xmath78 , and varying @xmath79 in the right panel while keeping @xmath80 .",
    "the other parameters are kept as before . for @xmath81 ,",
    "the equation of state for dark energy is slightly more negative . for @xmath82 , at higher redshift @xmath83 increases rapidly , and the coupling term would become very large , the whole system would be dominated by the evolution of matter .",
    "however , such a model would not really fit the low redshift observation , so it would not be relevant to our purpose . for large @xmath79 , we can also see that the equation of state of dark energy @xmath84 at high @xmath61 , but the variation is not as rapid as in the case of @xmath85 , and this is because the dark energy component does not increase as much as the dark matter component . still , this makes a poor fit to the observational data .",
    "anyway , for the case @xmath86 , eq.([eeos ] ) is reduced to @xmath87 substituting this equation into eq.([newrhol ] ) and making use of eq.(fredman - new1 ) , we obtain the following approximate equation for @xmath88 @xmath89 for which the solution will simply be @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a constant . this scaling behavior of dark energy density ( if @xmath86 ) is very similar to that of the chaplygin gas model @xcite , which at the high redshift also has the scaling behavior as @xmath92 while at the low redshift has the constant magnitude . however , in the present case it does not provide a good fit to the observations .",
    "now we fit the model parameters with the current observational data .",
    "we use three kinds of observations ; the first one is type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) which serves as the standard candle ; the second is the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) in large scale structure of galaxy distribution , the third is the cosmic microwave background anisotropies , the latter two provide standard rulers at different redshifts . for the flat geometry we are considering , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 are the luminosity distance , angular diameter distance and comoving coordinate distance , respectively , and @xmath95 is given by @xmath96 which could be calculated for each model by solving eq .",

    "observationally , the hde model is distinguishable from the @xmath68cdm , as its equation of state varies with time .",

    "for example , in the hde model the dark energy behaves as the chaplygin gas at high redshift if @xmath117 ( see the discussion at the end of sec.3 ) , but for the low redshift region , the equation of state of the chaplypin gas approaches a constant , while for this model it continues to evolve . in properly constructed hde models such as the ones discussed in this paper , the dark energy component is subdominant at high redshifts compared with matter or radiation , so it would not significantly affect the cmb or large scale structure power spectrum , though at low redshift it could affect the growth of structure in detail .",
    "we plan to investigate the details of the structure growth in subsequent studies .    in the framework of the holographic dark energy model",
