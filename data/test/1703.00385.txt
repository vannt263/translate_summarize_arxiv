    "with ages of the order of @xmath2-@xmath3 gyr , globular clusters ( gcs ) are thought to be among the first stellar systems formed at early epochs in the local group .",
    "thanks to the general homogeneity in terms of age and chemical composition of their stars , gcs have been used for decades as ideal tracers of the chemistry of their environments , allowing us to reconstruct the chemical enrichment history and the age - metallicity relation of their host galaxies .",
    "the current picture of gc formation and evolution moves away from the traditional paradigm of gcs as simple stellar population ( see for instance the seminal paper by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , according to which all the stars in a gc share the same initial chemical abundances for all the chemical elements .",
    "in fact , the recent discoveries of multiple sequences in gc colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds , see e.g. @xcite ) and of star - to - star variations in the chemical abundances of some light elements ( like c ,",
    "n , na , o , mg , al , see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) demonstrate that such systems are indeed much more complex .",
    "multiple populations ( mps ) are ubiquitous in all gcs studied so far , both in the galactic ( see for example @xcite ) and extra - galactic ( @xcite ) environment . since this chemical pattern has been observed in stars at all the evolutionary stages ( @xcite ) , it can not be explained in terms of internal mixing but it should have been imprinted in stars at formation .",
    "several scenarios interpret the photometric and spectroscopic evidence in terms of different generations of stars , with a first generation polluting the gas out of which second generation of stars formed with the products of their internal evolution . a number of candidate polluters have been proposed ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) ; namely asymptotic giant branch stars ( @xcite ) , fast - rotating massive stars ( @xcite ) , massive binaries ( @xcite ) and supermassive stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternative scenarios have been proposed as well , where low - mass stars accrete the polluted material during the pre - main sequence phase to give rise to a chemically peculiar population of stars that is coeval to that with pristine composition ( @xcite ) .",
    "the abundance spreads typical of mps involve only a few light elements . for most of the elements ( in particular @xmath1-elements like si , ca and ti , iron - peak and neutron - capture elements ) the stars in a typical gc exhibit a remarkable level of internal homogeneity , thus suggesting that the abundances of these elements in gcs can be used to trace the chemical composition of the gas from which the cluster formed .",
    "therefore , the investigation through high - resolution spectroscopy of the chemistry of poorly ( or not yet ) studied clusters is crucial to understand the chemical evolution of the galactic halo ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to identify , through the chemical tagging , clusters that likely originated in extragalactic environments @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present the first detailed chemical study of ngc  6362 , an intermediate metallicity clusters which belongs to the low - mass tail of the gc mass distribution , with a mass of only @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we list cluster fundamental properties in tab .",
    "[ tab0 ] , along with other useful informations . @xcite firstly measured its iron content ( [ fe / h]= 1.09 @xmath0 0.01 dex ) by analysing 160 giant stars observed with flames at the very large telescope .",
    "they also found a bimodal [ na / fe ] distribution , that makes ngc  6362 one of the least massive clusters where mps have been detected .",
    "the peculiar radial distribution of its stars , with both first and second populations being completely mixed out to several half light radii , has been interpreted by @xcite as the result of heavy mass - loss due to long - term dynamical evolution .",
    "such a claim is also supported by the quite shallow present - day mass function observed for this cluster in @xcite .",
    "thus , it would be extremely interesting to investigate whether it also shows other exceptional chemical features or it follows the general trends observed for standard gcs in the milky way with mps . to this end ,",
    "we here present a detailed chemical analysis of 11 members in ngc  6362 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the dataset analysed in this work is described in section [ data ] , while the details of the chemical analysis are discussed in section [ analysis ] .",
    "we present the results of this study in section [ res ] and we finally discuss them in section [ discuss ] .",
    "the dataset analysed in this work was acquired under the programs 093.d-0618(a ) and 097.d-0325(a ) , pi : dalessandro , with the flames spectrograph ( @xcite ) at the eso very large telescope .",
    "we used the combined medusa+uves configuration , which allowed the simultaneous allocation of eight uves high - resolution fibres and 132 medusa mid - resolution fibres per exposure . while the stars observed in the medusa mode have been discussed in @xcite , in this work we focus on the eleven stars observed with the uves 580 red arm spectral configuration , with a resolution of r@xmath545000 in the spectral range @xmath6  .",
    "targets have been selected from the wide field imager ( wfi ) photometric catalogue presented in @xcite . for this study , only red giant branch ( rgb ) stars brighter than v@xmath7 mag have been targeted ( see figure [ cmd_targ ] ) . also , to avoid contamination from neighbours , only stars with no close ( i.e. within 2 )",
    "sources brighter than v@xmath8 v@xmath9 have been selected .",
    "four exposures of 45 min for each target have been secured .",
    "two uves fibres have been used to sample the sky background , thus allowing a proper sky subtraction for each individual exposure .",
    "cc right ascension ( h : m : s ) & @xmath10:@xmath11:@xmath12 + declination ( @xmath13 : : ) & -@xmath14:@xmath15:@xmath16 + distance ( kpc ) & @xmath17 + r@xmath18 ( ) & @xmath19 + mass ( @xmath20 ) & @xmath21 + @xmath22fe / h@xmath23 $ ] ( dex ) & @xmath24 + [ tab0 ]    to reduce the acquired data , we used the last version of the flames - uves common pipeline libraries based eso pipeline , which includes bias - subtraction , flat - field correction , wavelength calibration with a standard th - ar lamp , extraction of one - dimensional spectra and order merging .",
    "the accuracy of the dispersion solution has been checked by comparing the observed position of several sky emission lines with their rest - frame position as reported in the sky lines atlas by @xcite .",
    "no significant wavelength shifts have been found .",
    "once extracted , all the individual ( sky - subtracted ) exposures of each target have been brought to the same reference by correcting for the corresponding heliocentric radial velocity ( see sect.[vrad ] for the details ) , and finally combined together to obtain a median spectrum .",
    "the final reduced spectra have signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) larger than @xmath530 at any wavelength .          radial velocities ( v@xmath25 )",
    "have been measured using the wrapper 4dao ( @xcite ) , which allows to run daospec @xcite for large sets of spectra , tuning automatically its main input parameters .",
    "for all the eleven targets , we treated the two uves chips of each single exposure independently .",
    "for the lower ( l ) chip , v@xmath25 have been computed by using @xmath26 absorption lines , while for the upper ( u ) chip the lines used were @xmath27 . for each target",
    "we obtained a remarkably good agreement between the measurements of the two independent chips , finding an average difference of only v@xmath28-v@xmath29 km@xmath30s@xmath31 ( @xmath32 km@xmath30s@xmath31 ) .",
    "moreover , we did not find any significant difference among the v@xmath25 measured for the four exposures of each target .",
    "this indicates that none of the observed targets are binary systems .",
    "we then computed the final values of v@xmath25 as the average value of the eight single exposure measurements ( two chips for each of the four exposures ) and we adopted the dispersion around the mean divided by @xmath33 as uncertainty .",
    "heliocentric velocities and related errors are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we measured an average v@xmath25 of v@xmath34 km@xmath30s@xmath31 ( @xmath35 km@xmath30s@xmath31 ) , which is in agreement with the value derived by @xcite ( v@xmath36 km@xmath30s@xmath31 , @xmath37 km@xmath30s@xmath31 ) . according to their v@xmath25 distribution all the targeted stars are members , having v@xmath25 values that lie well within 2@xmath38 from the systemic velocity .",
    "effective temperatures ( t@xmath39 ) and surface gravities ( @xmath40 @xmath41 ) for target stars have been derived from their the b and v magnitudes , in the same way as described in in @xcite .",
    "we correct magnitudes and colours for differential reddening using the procedure outlined in @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "differential reddening corrections across the whole wfi field of view range from @xmath42=-0.03 $ ] mag to + 0.03 mag around the adopted average colour excess e(b - v)@xmath43 mag ( @xcite ) .",
    "errors on the parameters affecting the determination of the absolute colour for the analysed targets , i.e photometric errors or uncertainty on the absolute and differential reddening ( @xmath44}}$ ] and @xmath45}}$ ] , respectively ) could potentially affect our t@xmath39 estimates .",
    "thus , to evaluate the uncertainties on @xmath46 we re - determined temperatures assuming typical errors on colors and extinction of @xmath47 mag , @xmath44}}=0.04 $ ] mag and @xmath45}}=0.02 $ ] mag , respectively .",
    "we underline that the quoted values are conservative upper limits , since the nominal photometric errors of such bright and well exposed stars are @xmath48 mag , while the errors on the absolute and differential reddening estimates correspond to about the 50% of their value ( see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we measure a typical uncertainty on t@xmath39 of @xmath49 k.    stars located in the brightest portion of the rgb , especially those approaching the rgb tip , can be significantly be affected by non - lte effects that spuriously decrease the iron abundances from fei lines leaving those from feii lines unaltered ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this causes the spectroscopic derivation of @xmath40 @xmath41 through ionization equilibrium ( i.e. @xmath40 @xmath41 is constrained by imposing that both neutral and ionized iron lines give the same abundance ) to be systematically biased towards lower gravities .",
    "thus , we prefer to rely on photometric gravities , derived by using the stefan - boltzmann relation .",
    "we adopted an absolute distance modulus of ( m - m)@xmath50 mag ( from @xcite ) , bolometric corrections from @xcite and a mass of @xmath51 .",
    "such a mass has been derived from the best fit isochrone taken from the basti dataset ( @xcite ) , with an age of 12 gyr , z=0.004 and @xmath1-enhanced chemical mixture ( corresponding to [ fe / h]@xmath52 dex ) .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath40 @xmath41 have been computed by taking into account the errors on t@xmath39 ( as described above ) , bolometric luminosity ( due to all the photometric uncertainties ) and mass ( we assumed @xmath53 , that corresponds to the range of masses that populate the entire rgb according to the best - fit isochrone ) .",
    "the final uncertainty on @xmath40 @xmath41 is about @xmath54 dex .",
    "finally , microturbulent velocities v@xmath55 have been derived spectroscopically , by requiring no trend between the measured iron abundances and the line strengths .",
    "typical uncertainties on this parameter are about @xmath56 km@xmath30s@xmath31 .",
    "the atmospheric parameters for each analysed target are shown in table [ tab1 ]",
    ".      the adopted linelist has been compiled by selecting only transitions that are unblended at the temperatures , gravities , and metallicities of sampled stars .",
    "atomic data are from the lastest version of the kurucz - castelli database , improved for some specific cases with new and updated values .    for the elements in our linelist with single and unblended lines we estimated the chemical abundances from the measured equivalent width ( ew ) , by using the package gala @xcite .",
    "we run gala keeping t@xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41 of the model fixed and allowing its metallicity to vary iteratively in order to match the iron abundance measured from ews .",
    "all the model atmospheres have been computed by means of the atlas9 code ( @xcite ) , while ews were measured by using daospec through the code 4dao ( see section [ vrad ] ) .",
    "ew uncertainties are estimated by daospec as the standard deviation of the local flux residuals ( see * ? ? ?",
    "all the lines with ew errors larger than 10% were excluded from the analysis .",
    "solar reference abundances are taken from @xcite .    only for the lines with hyperfine structure and/or isotopic splitting ( cu ,",
    "ba , nd , eu , la ) , abundances have been obtained by individually comparing the observed spectral lines with a grid of synthetic spectra computed with synthe ( @xcite ) , by running a @xmath57-minimization algorithm ( see the procedure described in * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , synthetic spectra  computed by assuming for each star the appropriate atmospheric parameters derived as described in section  [ atm ] ",
    "are convolved at the uves resolution and finally re - sampled at the pixel size as the observed spectra .",
    "the total uncertainties on abundance measurements has been derived by considering two main sources of error : the internal error associated to the measurement procedure and the errors arising from the uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters .",
    "we defined as internal error the dispersion around the mean divided by the square root of the number of lines used to compute abundances .",
    "abundances of elements measured via spectral synthesis method ( namely cu , la and eu ) come from the measurement of only one line . in this case , the corresponding internal error has then been computed by means of monte carlo simulations .",
    "briefly , poissonian noise is added to the best - fit synthetic spectrum in order to reproduce the observed snr and then the procedure to derive the abundance is repeated .",
    "the dispersion of the abundances measured from 1000 monte carlo realizations has been adopted as the internal abundance uncertainty .",
    "depending on the snr around these lines ( ranging from @xmath58 to @xmath59 ) , the typical internal errors obtained in this way range from @xmath60 dex up to @xmath61 dex .    in order to quantify the error coming from the uncertainties on the atmospheric parameters , we repeated the chemical analysis by varying each parameter for the corresponding uncertainty ( see section [ atm ] ) .",
    "the total uncertainty on the [ x / h ] abundances has been computed by summing in quadrature this contribution and the intrinsic error described above .",
    "as discussed by in @xcite this kind of uncertainty , when related to abundance ratios as [ x / y]=[x / h]-[y / h ] , partially cancel out because lines of the same ionization stage tend to react in a similar way to changes in the stellar parameters .",
    "therefore , we followed their prescription to calculate our final [ x / fe ] abundance uncertainties .",
    "in this section the results of the chemical analysis are described for each elemental group . in particular , elemental abundances as found for ngc  6362 ( always shown as a red empty star symbol in figures 3 - 8 ) are directly compared to abundances taken from the literature for other gcs ( values from @xcite are shown as green filled circles , while data from @xcite are plotted as blue filled circles , if not stated otherwise ) and galactic field stars ( grey dots , data from from @xcite ) . all the measured values and the corresponding uncertainties are listed in tables [ tab2 ] , [ tab3 ] and [ tab4 ] , while the average abundance ratios are listed in table [ tab5 ] .    * _ iron abundances_. + by using the maximum likelihood ( ml ) algorithm described in @xcite , we found that the iron distribution for our spectroscopic sample is best described by a gaussian function with mean @xmath8[fei / h]@xmath62 and a null dispersion of @xmath63}}=0.00\\pm0.01 $ ] .",
    "the derived fe abundance agrees well with the value provided by @xcite , i.e. [ fei / h]@xmath64 dex",

    "another significant feature related to the existence of mps in the form of light element abundance spreads is the presence of star - to - star variations in mg and al abundances .",

    "therefore , we can conclude that in terms of light element abundance , ngc  6362 behaves as the other gcs with similar mass and metallicity , both according to the differential analysis with respect to m  4 and to the observational - based prediction of @xcite . *",
    "_ @xmath1- and iron - peak elements . _ + ngc  6362 is characterized by enhanced abundances for all the measured @xmath1-elements , with an average value of @xmath8[@xmath1/fe]@xmath105 .",
    "this value matches well those measured in m  4 and in the other galactic gcs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this finding confirms that ngc  6362 formed from gas enriched by core - collapse supernovae in a similar way to other galactic gcs ( excluding some gcs likely accreted by extragalactic galaxies and characterized by lower [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios ) .",
    "in particular , ngc  6362 and m  4 show very similar @xmath1 abundances , suggesting that they share a similar chemical enrichment by core - collapse supernovae .",
    "also for the iron - peak elements , the analysis shows that ngc  6362 follows the same abundance patterns of the other gcs and no remarkable ( element - by - element ) difference is found between ngc  6362 and m  4 . * _ s- and r - process elements _ + the cluster has a [ ba / fe ] abundance ratio compatible with those of gcs of similar metallicity , like m4 , ngc  288 and ngc  6171 , and , in general , agrees well with the run of [ s / fe ] abundance ratios with [ fe / h ] ( see fig.1 in * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , metal - poor gcs show roughly solar [ ba / fe ] ratios , as the production of ba at those metallicities is dominated by r - processes . on the other hand",
    "[ ba / eu ] increases with increasing the metallicity , because of the higher efficiency of the s - process . in the case of ngc  6362",
    ", [ ba / eu ] reaches @xmath106 dex , compatible with the value measured in m  4 ( [ ba / eu]@xmath107 dex ) and the same is observed also for [ la / eu ] and [ nd / eu ] . even if ngc  6362 has a [ ba / fe ] compatible with that of m  4 at a level of 2@xmath38 ( at variance with the other abundance ratios that are compatible within 1@xmath38 ) , the two clusters show the same relative efficiency of s- to r - process",
    "therefore , the general enhancement of s - process element abundances measured in ngc  6362 suggests that the first generation of cluster stars @xmath101 ) formed from gas already enriched by low - mass ( @xmath108 ) agb stars , that are the main producers of s - process elements , the so - called main - component ( see e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath102 ) did not introduce any spread the s - process abundance of second generation stars .",
    "summing all up , the differential comparison between ngc  6362 and m  4 revealed that all the elemental abundances measured for the two clusters match within 1-@xmath38 ( with the marginal exception of [ ba / fe ] ) .",
    "none of the elements analysed in this work show any internal spread in ngc  6362 .",
    "it is worth noting that ngc  6362 and m  4 also display the same extent of na variation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "according to the compilation of gc masses in @xcite , and of gc metallicities in @xcite , the only clusters with properties similar to ngc  6362 and m  4 ( and not associated with the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy , see @xcite ) which have been chemically investigated in detail are ngc  288 and ngc  6171 .",
    "they both belong to the sample of clusters studied by @xcite , and as such they are plotted in fig.[sicati ] , in the same metallicity range as that of ngc6362 .",
    "their chemical composition is consistent with that of the two clusters analysed in this work .",
    "therefore , we conclude that ngc  6362 is a regular gc that shows the chemical composition representative of the milky way gcs with similar mass and metallicity , with the signatures of chemical enrichment by core - collapse supernovae and agb stars .",
