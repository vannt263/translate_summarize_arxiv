    "besides a temperature change , the transition can be triggered by illumination with visible light @xcite , or x - rays @xcite and also by application of pressure @xcite .",
    "the materials have potential technological applications like magneto - optic devices based on photoinduced magnetism .    in the compound studied in this paper , , the ht phase is cubic ( f@xmath73 m ; z=4 ) with mn@xmath3 and fe@xmath5 ions in s=5/2 and s=1/2 spin states respectively .",
    "the lt mn@xmath5 ( s=2 ) , fe@xmath3 ( s=0 ) phase has a tetragonal symmetry ( i@xmath7m2 ; z=2 ) .",
    "the charge transfer transformation is driven by a jahn - teller distortion of mn@xmath5 ions @xcite .",
    "the transition has a broad thermal hysteresis with the lt@xmath8ht transition at approximately 300 k and the ht@xmath8lt transition at about 175 k @xcite . in the lt phase , below @xmath9 the s=2 spins of the mn@xmath5 ions order ferromagnetically @xcite .    in the present detailed study of single crystals and powder pba samples , we discuss the origin of esr active defects and set a lower limit for the unusually fast spin relaxation rate in the bulk .",
    "the experimental findings in powders are in good agreement with the study of pregelj et al.@xcite .",
    "we assign an isotropic esr line to a cubic cluster ( denoted hereafter `` c - cluster '' ) of mn@xmath3 ions surrounding the structural defect shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and described earlier by vertelman et al.@xcite .",
    "the c - clusters are remarkably well isolated from the bulk and are only little affected by the ht - lt charge transfer transition . at low temperatures c - clusters remain superparamagnetic even below the ferromagnetic curie temperature of the bulk , at @xmath10=11 k. in single crystals , defects with lower symmetry are also observed .",
    "we find no esr of the bulk in spite of an intensive search ; spin relaxation broadening of the line is more than 1 t. the lack of a bulk esr in the high temperature phase is surprising as the s=5/2 spin mn@xmath3 and the s=1/2 fe@xmath5 ions are usually easily observed .",

    "[ fig3],width=343 ]    the intensity of the esr line , which is proportional to the spin susceptibility of the esr active species , was measured at ambient temperature in a powder sample at 9.4  ghz using cuso@xmath13@xmath145h@xmath2o reference .",
    "the esr intensity of the powder sample corresponds to a concentration of about 2.5% of mn@xmath3 ions .",
    "this is much less than expected for a resonance arising from one s=5/2 mn@xmath3 paramagnetic ion per formula unit . a line with so small intensity can not arise from the esr of the bulk , only from defect sites .",
    "we searched in vain for a broad line corresponding to the bulk of magnetic ions .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , at 222.4  ghz the 20  mt broad resonance line of mn@xmath3 defect sites at g=2.0006 is the only observable resonance within the range of 0 to 9  t. thus the esr of the bulk is very broad : a 1  t broad resonance with the intensity of the bulk mn@xmath3 ions would have been easily detected as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the defects with isotropic esr were observed in powders at both frequencies and all temperatures . at room temperature ,",
    "the line width of the defects , @xmath15 , in the powder is almost independent of the larmor frequency , @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "the g factor of the powder has a curious frequency dependence , it varies from g=2.022 at @xmath16 = 9.4  ghz to 2.0006 at 222.4  ghz .",
    "the ht - lt transition affects only weakly the esr signal of the defect sites .",
    "the line is slightly narrower in the ht phase than in the lt phase , and there is a small hysteresis in the line width between 175 and 300  k ( fig .  [ fig3 ] inset ) . within experimental accuracy",
    "the esr intensity follows a curie law ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) between 50 and 300  k , it is not affected by the ht - lt transition . on the other hand , the spin crossover is clear in static magnetization measurements of similar powders .",
    "we conclude that there is no spin crossover in the magnetic ions of the esr active defect sites .",
    "the defect is not a single isolated magnetic ion .",
    "below 50  k the esr magnetic spin susceptibility increases faster than predicted by the curie - law and at 5  k it is several times larger than expected for a constant concentration of free spins .",
    "the 9.4  ghz esr line slightly narrows below 50  k and then increases rapidly as the sample is cooled below the ferromagnetic ordering temperature of the bulk at 11  k ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . at 222.4",
    "ghz the line starts to broaden already at 25  k , i.e at a much higher temperature than in low magnetic field .",
    "as in powders , there is no intense resonance of the bulk in the superior sample quality single crystals .",
    "however , unlike in powders , in single crystals two types of esr active defects appear with isotropic and anisotropic g factors .",
    "three resonances were clearly resolved with different line widths and resonance fields in the single crystal , 9.4  ghz , ambient temperature esr spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the anisotropic defects have a complicated behavior , which is not understood .",
    "the line positions and widths are strongly temperature dependent . at temperatures below 110 k ,",
    "the most intensive line is at about g=2.079 ( not shown ) .",
    "the low symmetry defects in the single crystal were only observed at 9.4 ghz . at 222.4  ghz in a single crystal only an isotropic line was observed at g=2.0006 with a line width similar to the line of the powder spectra .",
    "the weak 9.4 ghz single crystal esr lines , indicated by arrows , are superimposed on a broad instrumental background .",
    "[ fig2],width=347 ]",
    "in this and the following sections we focus on the properties of defect sites , the reason for the absence of the esr of the bulk is discussed in subsection [ absence ] .",
    "the g - factor of the esr in powders is isotropic , otherwise the line would broaden at high frequencies . in the same defects the crystal field ( zero field splitting ) is small , otherwise the low frequency line would broaden .",
    "it is natural to assign this isotropic line to a defect with cubic symmetry .",
    "the anisotropic esr lines in single crystals at low frequency arise from defects with lower symmetry .",
    "we propose that the isotropic g - factor line is the esr of c - clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) with a simple configuration of 6 weakly interacting mn@xmath3 ions on the cube surrounding a defect .",
    "a larger cubic cluster with many more ions can not be entirely ruled out .",
    "h@xmath2o molecules attached to mn ions fill the fe(cn)@xmath17 vacancy and in this environment the mn@xmath3 state is stabilized at all temperatures .",
    "the clusters have very little magnetic interaction with the surrounding lattice and the esr is almost unaffected by the ht - lt phase transition .",
    "we do not know how this isolation is realized .",
    "the structure of the c - cluster explains qualitatively several characteristics of the esr spectra : i. ) the isotropy of the g factor , ii . ) the nonlinear variation of the line position with frequency , iii ) the temperature and frequency dependence of the line width , iv . )",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of the esr active sites .",
    "we first discuss i. ) and ii . ) which follow from the particular structure of the defect , while iii . ) and iv . )",
    "discussed in subsection [ superpara ] .",
    "are linked to the superparamagnetism below 50  k.    the c - cluster as a whole is cubic , but individual mn@xmath3 ions are not in a cubic environment since one of their six first fe neighbors is missing .",
    "if mn@xmath3 ions in the c - cluster were isolated from each other then the crystal field ( fine structure ) and g factor anisotropy would render their esr lines strongly anisotropic .",
    "a magnetic field in a general orientation would split the esr of c - clusters of a single crystal into 3 mn@xmath3 lines with different g - factors and a fine structure ( and a hyperfine structure ) of several lines . in the powder , the esr of noninteracting mn ions would be broad and frequency dependent .",
    "a coupling between mn@xmath3 ions within the c - clusters explains the observed isotropy .",
    "an isotropic exchange interaction between mn ions , mediated by fe , narrows the g factor anisotropy , @xmath18 , and the fine structure splitting , @xmath19 .",
    "a small exchange energy , @xmath20 , is sufficient to merge all lines of a single cluster into a single isotropic line . @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",
    "are the conditions for this type of exchange narrowing @xcite , at high frequencies ( compared to @xmath19 ) and high temperatures ( @xmath23 ) the crystal field ( or `` zero field splitting '' ) does not shift the line . on the other hand , at low esr frequencies , where @xmath16 and @xmath19 are comparable , the crystal field shifts the average line position even if the spectrum is narrowed by exchange . in second order ,",
    "the fine structure shift is of the order of @xmath24 .",
    "the observed apparent g - shift from 2.0006 at 222.4 ghz to 2.022 at 9.4 ghz corresponds to a fine structure splitting of @xmath25  t if the shift is from the -1/2@xmath81/2 transition of mn@xmath3 ions .",
    "( the shifts of other transitions are of similar order . )    the crystal field at cluster mn sites changes the 222.4  ghz spectra at low temperatures where @xmath26 . at high temperatures the thermal population of zeeman levels",
    "are not very different , thus esr fine structure transitions have comparable intensities . however , at low temperatures the thermal energy ( k@xmath27 t ) is smaller than the zeeman energy and the higher zeeman energy states are depopulated . in this case",
    "only fine structure transitions between the lower zeeman energy states contribute to the spectrum . as a result",
    "the exchange narrowed line shifts towards the fine structure transition between the lowest lying states.@xcite . we have observed this shift at 222.4 ghz where @xmath28=40 k is the energy of the highest zeeman level . the resonance field of the pb powder at 25 k is down shifted 0.03  t compared to ambient temperature . as expected , this shift at 25k and 222.4 ghz is of the order of the estimation of @xmath25  t from the low frequency data . from the sign of the shift",
    "we conclude that @xmath29 .",
    "the complicated structure of single crystal 9.4  ghz spectra at room temperature can be caused by the crystal field and g - factor anisotropy in non cubic clusters .    as explained in subsection [ absence ] ,",
    "spin relaxation of bulk magnetic ions in the ht state is extremely fast and is without doubt even faster in the lt state . nevertheless , the ht to lt transition changes the line width by only 2  mt ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , thus c - clusters are well isolated from the bulk .",
    "a significant coupling to the bulk would result in a fast spin relaxation and a large esr line broadening . as expected for isolated c - clusters with no phase transition ; the esr intensity is also unchanged at the ht@xmath8lt transition .      above 50",
    "k the spin susceptibility of defects is to a good approximation curie like , but below 50 k the esr intensity increases faster than 1/t .",
    "we argue that this is due superparamagnetism at low temperatures where a ferromagnetic exchange between mn ions in clusters is significant . for definitiveness ,",
    "we consider the cluster of 6 s=5/2 mn@xmath3 ions coupled through 12 s=1/2 fe@xmath5 ions ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , other configurations with a larger cluster size can not be ruled out .",
    "the cluster has a common exchange narrowed resonance of all magnetic ions since the g - factor is about 2 for both mn@xmath3 and fe@xmath5 ions .",
    "an indirect mn - mn exchange coupling through magnetic fe@xmath5 ions is always ferromagnetic , independent of the sign of the mn - fe exchange . at low temperatures the total spin of six mn@xmath3 ions is s=15 and",
    "the spin of the full cluster is between s@xmath30=21 , and s@xmath30=9 for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic mn - fe coupling respectively .",
    "thus at low temperatures , the magnetic moment of the cluster is large and the susceptibility increases with decreasing temperature much faster than for non - interacting ions . at much higher temperatures than j",
    "the susceptibility is about that of free mn@xmath3 ions .",
    "a mn - mn exchange interaction within the cluster of the order of j=10  k ( and a much weaker interaction with the bulk ) explains the esr susceptibility .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition of the bulk at @xmath10=11  k does not affect significantly the 9 ghz esr intensity , which continuously increases to the lowest measurement temperature of 5 k. on the other hand , below 11  k the 9 ghz esr line width increases abruptly .",
    "this is well explained with a ferromagnetic transition of the bulk at 11  k and no ferromagnetic ordering of the superparamagnetic clusters .",
    "the cluster esr line broadening of 14  mt below the ferromagnetic transition of the bulk arises either from long range dipolar interactions , i.e. inhomogeneous demagnetizing fields or a small exchange coupling to the bulk .",
    "we discuss the possible reasons for which only defects are esr active and the esr of the bulk material was not observed .    in general , to observe esr the spin relaxation rate must be less than @xmath16 .",
    "the lack of a spin resonance in the lt phase is not surprising : fe@xmath3 is not magnetic and mn@xmath5 has an s=2 spin for which orbital effects are important .",
    "phonons modulate the crystal field and the fast spin relaxation broadens the esr of mn@xmath5 ions beyond observability . on the other hand ,",
    "the lack of bulk esr above the spin crossover is not easily explained .",
    "crystals with mn@xmath3 ( s=5/2 ) and fe@xmath5 ( s=1/2 ) ions usually have narrow esr lines with giromagnetic factors near g=2 .",
    "fine splitting from crystal fields is relatively small for the half filled 3d@xmath31 shell of mn@xmath3 .",
    "there is no zero field splitting for s=1/2 fe@xmath5 ions either , the esr of this ion is not strongly anisotropic and has been frequently observed in solids .",
    "moreover , crystal field anisotropy ( fine structure splitting ) and the dipolar interaction are ineffective in magnetically dense systems . in pba",
    "the exchange interaction between mn and fe ions is larger than dipolar and single ion crystal field energies and the esr is exchange narrowed i.e. one expects a common mn@xmath3 , fe@xmath5 narrow esr resonance in the bulk .",
    "yet , we find that the esr of the bulk of pba is very broad , more than 1  t , i.e. at least two orders of magnitude broader than the esr of the mn@xmath3 defects clusters in the same system . at a larmor frequency of 9.4  ghz , a larger than 1  t line width means that the life time broadening is more than the resonance field and there is no esr of the bulk at all .",
    "a small admixture of the s=2 mn@xmath5 and s=0 fe@xmath3 states into the pure s=5/2 mn@xmath3 and s=1/2 fe@xmath5 states in the ht phase is the most probable explanation for this rapid spin lattice relaxation .",
    "charge fluctuations persisting above the lt - ht transition induce a rapid spin relaxation and consequently a very broad or non - existent esr .",
    "this admixture was also seen by x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) and raman spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "single crystals of contain esr active defects both with cubic and lower symmetry . at high frequency and in powders the low symmetry defects",
    "are not observed .",
    "the isotropic defect esr is assigned to a cubic c - cluster of mn@xmath3 ions around fe(cn)@xmath17 vacancies , which interacts very weakly with the bulk . at low temperatures the c - clusters are superparamagnetic but they do not order at the @xmath10=11  k ferromagnetic transition of the bulk .",
    "we suggest that the electronic configuration at high temperatures is not a pure configuration of mn@xmath3 and fe@xmath5 ions but has an admixture of mn@xmath5 and fe@xmath3 states of the low temperature phase .",
    "this is the reason for the lack of an observable esr of mn@xmath3 and fe@xmath5 ions in the bulk .",
