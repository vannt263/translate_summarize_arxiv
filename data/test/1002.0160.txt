    "for many years , the dominant method for discovering massive clusters of galaxies at @xmath11 , has been via x - ray emission from the hot gas in their dark matter potential wells . over the years",
    ", the _ rosat _ and _ xmm - newton _ telescopes , in particular , have yielded a handful of well - studied examples e.g. , rdcs j0910 + 5422 @xcite , rdcs j1252.9 - 2927 @xcite , rx j0848 + 4452 ( lynx e ; @xcite ) , xmmu j2235 - 25 @xcite , and xmmxcs j2215.9 - 1738 @xcite .",
    "in recent years , it has been realised that , by incorporating deep infrared ( ir ) observations , existing optical imaging techniques can be adapted to successfully detect clusters at redshifts competitive to the existing x - ray surveys .",
    "however , because ir observations covering only modest areas ( 120 arcmin@xmath1 - 7.25 deg@xmath1 ) have been available , the ( cluster or candidate ) systems detected to date have been less massive than those discovered from the x - ray surveys ( @xcite ; although see @xcite ) .",
    "massive clusters of galaxies are rare , and one requires as widefield a survey as possible to detect them . the largest area _",
    "space telescope survey is the 50 square degree seven passband ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , 24 , 70 , 160 @xmath12 ) spitzer wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ) legacy survey @xcite .",
    "we have obtained deep @xmath13band imaging @xcite , and combined this with the pre - existing infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) observations from the swire survey , aiming to select clusters at @xmath14 using a two filter @xmath15 $ ] infrared adaptation of the well - proven optical cluster red sequence ( rs ) method @xcite .",
    "the sparcsgillianw / sparcs ] survey @xcite , is now complete and has an effective area ( defined as the usable overlap with swire after excluding chip gaps , regions near bright stars , etc ) , of 41.9 deg@xmath16 .",
    "the sparcs catalog contains several hundred cluster candidates at @xmath14 , by far the largest , homogeneously selected sample of its kind . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "we presented an overview of the sparcs survey , and reported spectroscopic confirmation of three clusters at @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in this paper , we report spectroscopic confirmation of three additional clusters at @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    the paper is organized as follows : in  [ observations ] , we describe the imaging and spectroscopic observations , and the data reduction ; in  [ analysis ] , we describe the spectroscopic catalog ; in  [ results ] , we present our results for the three individual clusters , and estimate the cluster velocity dispersions and dynamical masses ; and in  [ discussion ] , we present a discussion and the main conclusions based on our results .",
    "we assume a @xmath21-cdm cosmology with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and h@xmath24 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "the sparcs / swire survey is comprised of six fields ( see table 1 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the three clusters described in this paper were identified as high significance cluster candidates in the 7.9 deg@xmath1 elais - n1 field .",
    "a full description of the sparcs data reduction , cluster candidate detection algorithm and catalogs will appear in muzzin et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation .",
    "we provide only a brief overview of the main details here .",
    "sparcs @xmath0 observations of the northern fields were observed by cfht / megacam for a total integration time of 6000s per pointing .",
    "photometry was performed on both the @xmath25 and irac mosaics using the sextractor photometry package @xcite .",
    "the total 3.6 @xmath12 magnitude of all sources in the field was computed using a large aperture , equal to the geometric mean radius of the sextractor isophotal aperture .",
    "further details of the photometric pipeline may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the depth of the @xmath0 data varies from pointing to pointing depending on the seeing and the sky background , however , the mean 5 @xmath26 depth for extended sources in the elais - n1 field was @xmath27 vega ( 24.2 ab ) .",
    "the @xmath28 color of all sources was computed using an aperture of diameter three irac pixels ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "no aperture corrections were applied to the @xmath25 photometry because the @xmath30 color aperture was much larger than the median seeing . however , the irac point spread function ( psf ) has broad wings compared to a typical ground - based seeing profile , and it was necessary to apply aperture corrections to the measured 3.6 @xmath12 magnitude before computing the color of each galaxy .",
    "galaxy clusters were identified in the sparcs survey , using an algorithm very similar to that described in detail in @xcite , as applied to the spitzer first look survey ( fls ; @xcite ) . for cluster detection in both the fls and sparcs surveys , we used an infrared adaptation of the cluster red - sequence ( crs ) technique @xcite .",
    "this algorithm maps the density of galaxies in a survey within narrow color slices , giving greater weight to brighter galaxies , and flagging the highest overdensities as candidate clusters .",
    "the one important difference here , compared to @xcite , is that the latter paper used an @xmath31 $ ] color to detect clusters at @xmath32 in the fls .",
    "the deeper irac data in swire ( @xmath33s frames ) , compared to the fls ( @xmath34s frames ) , combined with the @xmath15 $ ] color choice , allow sparcs to detect clusters to higher redshift than was possible with the fls dataset .    from analysis of the richnesses and colors , sparcs j161641 + 554513  and sparcs j161037 + 552417",
    "were identified as rich cluster candidates at @xmath11 , and sparcs j161315 + 564930  as an unusually rich cluster candidate at @xmath35 ( table  [ tab_clusters ] ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations of sparcs j161315 + 564930 , sparcs j161641 + 554513  and sparcs j161037 + 552417  were obtained with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; @xcite ) on the keck i telescope on the nights of april 3th and april 4th , 2008 .",
    "the seeing on both nights was about @xmath36 .",
    "lris has beam - splitters that separate the light between two sides : red @xcite and blue @xcite . on the red side",
    ", we used the 400 line mm@xmath5 grating which gives a coverage of @xmath37   centered at 8500  , with a dispersion of 1.86  / pixels .",
    "all the masks were designed with slits of 11 width , which gave a resolution of @xmath387 - 9   ( fwhm ) over the wavelength interval @xmath386600 - 9600  . for the redshift range of these particular clusters ,",
    "all of the prominent spectral features e.g. , the 4000  - rest - frame break or [ o@xmath39 emission line , fall in the lris red side wavelength window .",
    "we observed one mask each in the case of clusters sparcs j161315 + 564930  and sparcs j161641 + 554513 , and two in the case of sparcs j161037 + 552417 .",
    "the total exposure time was 6000s ( @xmath40 ) for sparcs j161315 + 564930 , 8400s ( @xmath41 ) for sparcs j161641 + 554513 , and 8400s ( @xmath42 ) and 7000s ( @xmath43 ) for mask @xmath44 and mask @xmath45 of sparcs j161037 + 552417  ( table  1 ) .",
    "the masks contained about 30 slits each ( five of these were alignment stars and the remaining 25 were galaxies , selected according to a sliding scale of priority ) .    to reduce the number of slits placed on obvious foreground galaxies",
    ", we prioritized slits on galaxies with colors near each cluster s red - sequence .",
    "to avoid significant selection bias , we used a very broad cut around the red - sequence , intended to include both star forming and non - star forming systems .",
    "slits were placed on galaxies with priorities from 1 to 4 .",
    "priority 1 was galaxies with colors within 0.2 magnitude of the rs , and with @xmath46 < 17.0 $ ] ( vega ) .",
    "priority 2 was galaxies with colors between 0.2 and 0.6 magnitudes bluer than the rs , and with @xmath47 < 18.7 $ ] .",

    "priorities 1 to 4 roughly correspond to bright red - sequence , blue cloud , faint red - sequence , and faint blue cloud galaxies respectively .",
    "approximately ten priority 1 galaxies could be accomodated per mask for sparcs j161315 + 564930 , and five per mask for sparcs j161641 + 554513  and sparcs j161037 + 552417 .    to reduce the lris data , we adapted custom software , based on that developed by @xcite to reduce vlt / fors2 data .",
    "overscan and bias corrections were applied to both the calibration ( bias , flats and lamp arcs ) and to the science ( clusters and standard stars ) frames using the iraf _ lrisbias _ and _ lccdproc _ tasks developed by g. d. wirth and c. fassnacht .",
    "after these corrections had been applied , the data were next corrected for geometric distortions across the dispersion axis , and then separated into individual slitlets and reduced using standard long - slit techniques .",
    "each individual slitlet was processed using an algorithm similar to that implemented in _ bogus _ ( developed by d. stern , a. j. bunker and s. a. stanford)stern / homepage / bogus.html ] .",
    "the flatfield slitlets were normalized and applied to the corresponding science slitlets .",
    "the individual 2d spectra were then background - subtracted and fringe - corrected before being stacked to produce a final co - added 2d spectrum .",
    "slits longer than 90 pixels ( @xmath48 ) were further corrected for  long - slit \" distortions .",
    "the 1d spectrum of the source ( or sources ) in each slitlet was then extracted using standard iraf tasks .",
    "a set of near lamp exposures were used to wavelength - calibrate the observations .",
    "lris spectra can suffer significant flexure which may introduce wavelength offsets as large as @xmath49   in the wavelength solution , in the most extreme cases .",
    "the offsets in the wavelength calibration due to flexure were corrected by comparing to the wavelengths of known skylines .",
    "we estimate the residual uncertainties in wavelength calibration to be at most 1  , which correspond to a redshift uncertainty of @xmath50 at @xmath51  .",
    "finally , a relative flux calibration was performed , using a sensitivity function spanning the range 5600 - 9400  which was obtained from long - slit observations of the standard stars feige 34 and feige 67 @xcite .",
    "a redshift solution was sought for each object by cross - correlating @xcite each of the lris spectra with observed galaxy templates @xcite using the task _ xcsao _ in the iraf _ rvsao _ package @xcite .",
    "if a redshift could be obtained for a spectrum , it was assigned a quality flag , `` q '' , with one of two possible values : 0 or 1 .",
    "high - confidence redshifts , unambiguously determined by two or more clear features in the continuum or in absorption , or by obvious emission lines such as [ o@xmath39 ( @xmath52 ) were assigned @xmath53 .",
    "lower - confidence redshifts based on ambiguous identification of a few spectral features , often in low s / n spectra , were assigned @xmath54 .",
    "in addition to a quality flag , an emission line flag , `` e '' , was also assigned to each galaxy , based on the presence or absence of emission line features .",
    "spectra displaying one or more emission feature such as h@xmath55 , [ o@xmath56(@xmath574959,@xmath575007 ) or h@xmath58 in the case of low - redshift ( @xmath59 ) galaxies , or [ o@xmath39(@xmath573727 ) in the case of higher redshift galaxies , were assigned @xmath60 .",

    "a systematic uncertainty in the rs color of 0.15 magnitude has been assumed ( this uncertainty reflects the fact that , at present , we are using the zeropoints provided by elixir for the @xmath0  observations . we expect , in the future , to be able to reduce these photometric uncertainties , using our own internal calibration ) .    columns 3 , 4 and 5 of table  [ tab_properties ] show the redshift that would be estimated for each cluster based on the measured rs color ( column 2 ) , assuming a solar metallicity single burst bc03 model and a formation redshift of either @xmath114 , 4 or 10 . as can be seen from table  [ tab_properties ] ( and the left panel of figure  [ zsandmasses ] ) , the photometric redshift inferred from the measured @xmath66 $ ] color has a slight dependence on one s choice of formation redshift , although differences in color between the models at @xmath115 are fairly small ( @xmath116 between @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) . utilizing the colors from the @xmath119 model ,",

    "a more detailed comparison between the model predictions and the observations will be made in a future paper employing a larger sample of sparcs clusters .    despite the aforementioned caveats , and the issue of degeneracies between the photometric redshift of the clusters and the formation redshifts of their galaxies ,",

    "the agreement between the two mass estimators can be seen in the right panel of figure  [ zsandmasses ] .",
    "based on all six sparcs clusters spectroscopically confirmed to date , our conclusion is that , in addition to there being excellent agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts , there is also reasonable agreement between the cluster dynamical and richness mass estimates .",

    "collectively , the six sparcs clusters confirmed to date ( the three clusters presented in @xcite and @xcite , plus the three clusters presented here ) , demonstrate that , given the availability of infrared observations , the rs technique is an efficient and effective method of detecting _ bona fide _ massive galaxy clusters at @xmath146 .",
    "moreover , our studies of these six clusters are showing that it is possible to infer fundamental parameters such as cluster redshift and mass _ from the survey data itself _",

    "the optical red - sequence cluster surveys , rcs-1 @xcite and rcs-2 @xcite , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) have shown that it is feasible to measure cosmological parameters from the evolution of the cluster mass function @xcite . in order to do this efficiently ,",
    "the survey data themselves are used to detect clusters , and also to estimate the redshift and the mass of those clusters .",
    "the redshift is estimated from the red sequence color @xcite , and the mass is estimated from the optical richness @xcite .",
    "the fact that sparcs is also now demonstrating the practicality of estimating redshifts and masses at @xmath146 from the survey data alone is heartening for the current generation of surveys aiming to utilize optical - infrared high redshift cluster observations to constrain cosmological parameters e.g. , sparcs , the ukirt infrared deep - sky survey deep extragalactic survey ( ukidss dxs ; @xcite),and the irac shallow cluster survey ( iscs ; @xcite )",
    ". these optical - ir surveys will provide complementary samples to those selected using the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , e.g. , the south pole telescope survey ( spt ; @xcite ) , the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ; @xcite ) , and the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ; @xcite ) .",
    "the complete sparcs catalog contains several hundred cluster candidates at @xmath14 .",
