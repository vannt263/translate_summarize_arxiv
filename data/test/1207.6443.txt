    "neutrinos have masses , the tiny masses far below the range of the masses of the quarks and charged leptons",
    ". maybe due to the non - zero masses , neutrinos oscillate among themselves , giving rise to a lepton - flavor violation ( lfv ) .",
    "neutrino masses and neutrino oscillations may be regarded as one of the most important experimental facts over the last thirty years @xcite .",
    "certain lfv processes such as @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 are closely related to the most cited picture of neutrino oscillations so far @xcite - they also occur , however tiny , if neutrinos oscillate . in this note ,",
    "i wish to point out that the cross - generation or off - diagonal neutrino - higgs interaction may serve as the detailed mechanism of neutrino oscillations , with some vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the new higgs field(s ) .    presumably just like other building blocks of matter such as quarks and charged leptons",
    ", we could treat these neutrinos as point - like dirac particles . then",
    ", neutrino oscillations are fundamental and deep , certainly deeper than oscillations in other composite systems - such as oscillations in the @xmath2 system .",
    "thus , it would be natural to describe the reaction as @xmath3 with some vev for the family higgs field @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are family - triplet dirac fields . here",
    "the curl - dot product is to be explained later .",
    "the existence of this unique story for neutrino oscillations is amazing .    for over half a century",
    ", we have the outstanding question why there are three generations in the minimal standard model @xcite . and , for the last decade",
    ", another outstanding puzzle emerges that the dark - matter world is about five times the visual ordinary - matter world ( the latter described by the minimal standard model ) . besides the role in the minimal standard model",
    ", neutrinos may be able to tell us something in the dark - matter world which our neutrinos are capable of talking to ( or interacting with ) .    indeed , there is room left for something very interesting .",
    "remember that the right - handed neutrinos never enter in the construction of the minimal standard model @xcite .",
    "the message that the right - handed neutrinos seem to be `` unwanted '' could be telling us something .",
    "now , the fact that neutrinos have tiny masses suggests that `` more naturally '' they would be four - component dirac particles , and unlikely to be the two - component majorana particles .",
    "the room left for the right - handed neutrinos is that they are `` unwanted '' in the minimal standard model and that they could form some multiplet(s ) under a new ( dark - matter ) gauge group besides the minimal standard model .",
    "we have some candidate from the symmetries - the family symmetry that there are three generations in the building blocks of ( ordinary ) matter , and so far only three .",
    "the puzzle so well - known that we no longer question ourselves why or why not !",
    "we have seen this fact , but we do nt know why - let s speculate that it could be the story associated with the dark - matter world .",
    "it arises naturally the so - called family gauge theory @xcite .",
    "note that the right - handed neutrinos do not appear in the minimal standard model .",
    "so , we could make a massive @xmath7 gauge theory completely independent of the minimal standard model , including the particle content .",
    "we could treat @xmath8 as a triplet under this @xmath7 - so to give rise to a family gauge theory .",
    "this completes the derivation of the family gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 is by definition the massive gauge theory - all the involved particles , except the neutrinos , are massive dark - matter particles .",
    "so , the question becomes : can we construct the overall consistent theory based on the group @xmath9 , i.e. , to add an extra @xmath7 to the minimal standard model ?",
    "the answer is an amazing `` yes '' .",
    "the first step is to decide what our `` basic units '' ( out of the building blocks of matter ) are and how many they are .",
    "for instance , the right - handed neutrino triplet @xmath8 ( @xmath10 - @xmath7 triplet and @xmath11 singlet ) would be a `` basic unit '' . in hwang and yan @xcite ,",
    "we assign three @xmath7 fermion triplets - @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ( charged ) .",
    "all quarks are singlets under @xmath7 . as the major second step",
    ", we have to check whether the complicated higgs mechanisms would work out .",
    "this is the `` amazing '' part of the story . in the extended standard model @xcite , we have three scalar / higgs fields : the standard - model higgs @xmath15 , the family higgs triplet @xmath16 , and the mixed family - triplet and @xmath11-doublet scalar / higgs @xmath17 . in the u - gauge",
    ", the standard - model higgs picks out the neutral component ( one degree of freedom ) , which in turn projects out the neutral components in @xmath17 such that the neutral part has the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( i.e. the `` projected - out higgs mechanism '' ) but the charged part remains to be massive .",
    "the neutral part of @xmath17 and the family higgs @xmath16 make the eight gauge bosons very massive , leaving four real family higgs .    using this language @xcite , we can write the mass term of the neutrinos :    @xmath18    which is an off - diagonal matrix ( in @xmath7 ) .",
    "although it is trivial , the operation does not belong to the mathematics of the matrix .",
    "that is , @xmath19 would transform into @xmath20 or into @xmath21 , @xmath20 would into @xmath21 or @xmath19 , and so on .",
    "this is interesting in view of neutrino oscillations , since it could be regarded as the underlying interaction ( mechanism ) for neutrino oscillations ( which we are talking about @xcite ) .",
    "an oscillation occurs in a way similar to the decay by way of creating a new species plus the vacuum expectation value ( or , changing the vacuum ) . in quantum mechanics",
    ", this may be so far the only way how an oscillation can occur .    to illustrate the point further , we calculate the golden lepton - flavor - violating decay @xmath0 as the celebrated example .",
    "we show in figures 1(a ) , 1(b ) , and 1(c ) three leading basic feynman diagrams . here",
    "the conversion of @xmath20 into @xmath19 is marked by a cross sign and it is a term from our off - diagonal interaction given above with the higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath22 and @xmath23 . here",
    "the higgs masses are assumed to be very large , i.e. , greater than a few @xmath24 , as in @xmath7 .",
    "the only small number ( coupling ) is @xmath25 , explaining the tiny masses of neutrinos .",
    ".,width=384 ]    using feynman rules from wu and hwang @xcite , we write , for fig .",
    "1(a ) ,    @xmath26    with @xmath27 .    on the other hand ,",
    "feynman rules yield , for fig .",
    "1(b ) , @xmath28 and a similar result for fig .",
    "the four - dimensional integrations can be carried out , via the dimensional integration formulae ( e.g. ch .",
    "10 , wu / hwang @xcite ) , especially if we drop the small masses compared to the w - boson mass @xmath29 in the denominator . in this way",
    ", we obtain @xmath30    it is interesting to note that the wave - function renormalization , as shown by figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) , yields @xmath31 noting that @xmath32 and @xmath33 would make the contribution from figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) to be the same as , but opposite in sign , that from fig .",
    "this is a manifestation of `` gauge invariance '' .    in a normal treatment",
    ", one ignores the wave - function renormalization diagrams 1(b ) and 1(c ) in the treatment of the decays @xmath0 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "thus , one may ignore some important cancelation , if any .",
    "comparing this to the dominant mode @xmath36 @xcite , we could obtain the branching ratio .",
    "the decay rate for @xmath37 , as would be obtained here , would be of the order @xmath38 , which is extremely small .",
    "the off - diagonal mass matrix would be modified by the self - energy diagram since the neutrinos form a triplet under @xmath7 .",
    "it is presumed that these self - energy diagrams , after the ultraviolet divergences get subtracted , lead to masses of the right order .",
    "the four family higgs have to belong to two triplets - the neutral part of @xmath17 and the purely family higgs @xmath16 .",
    "if it is two - two divided such as that addressed in @xcite , then the situation would be as follows :",
    "if the off - diagonal mass matrix is diagonalized alone , the three roots would be two negative and one positive , adding up to zero .",
    "this seems like one ordering in the masses of neutrinos - one up and two downs .",
    "of course , it could be three - one divided as well .    besides the golden decay @xmath37 ( much too small ) and neutrino oscillations ( already observed ) , violation of the @xmath39 universality is also anticipated and might be observed .",
    "as the baryon - antibaryon asymmetry is sometime attributed to the lepton - antilepton asymmetry , the current scenario for neutrino oscillations @xcite seems inadequate for this purpose .",
    "if we take the hints from neutrinos rather seriously , there are so much to discover , even though the minimal standard model for the ordinary - matter world would , by and large , remain to be intact .    of course",
    ", the standard - model higgs has now been discovered .",
    "the direct search for the family higgs and the massive family bosons in the @xmath24 range would be too costly .",
    "so , the searches for some lepton - flavor - violating decays and for violation of the @xmath39 universality would be alternative for the moment .    to sum up , if we treat neutrinos as `` point - like '' dirac particles , the curl - dot product as in eq .",
    "( 1 ) would be the way to go .",
    "it is the way to connect neutrino oscillations with the lepton - flavor - violating decays or reactions .",
    "the curl - dot products are _ not _ the matrix operations ( in the mathematics sense ) ; it represents a new way to introduce renormalizable interactions and so expands the horizon of quantum field theory .",
    "we believe that , in the dark - matter world , the dark - matter particles are also species in the extended standard model .",
    "most of reactions happening among dark - matter particles , even involving neutrinos , can not be detected in the ordinary - matter world .",
    "it is clear that the minimum extended standard model would be the extended standard model to be based on the group @xmath40 , since this model is rather unique ( and economical ) .",
    "the issue is whether our standard model would close up our world - that is , all particles in our world are accounted for .    in a slightly different context @xcite",
    ", i propose to work with two working rules : `` dirac similarity principle '' , based on eighty years of experience , and `` minimum higgs hypothesis '' , from the last forty years of experience .",
    "using these two working rules , the extended model mentioned above becomes rather unique - so , it is so much easier to check it against the experiments .",
    "the close - up question of our world may have to be answered , provided that the two working rules , or similar , are assumed .",
    "we would be curious about how the dark - matter world looks like , though it is difficult to verify experimentally .",
    "the first question would be : the dark - matter world , 25 % of the current universe ( in comparison , only 5 % in the ordinary matter ) , would clusterize to form the dark - matter galaxies , maybe even before the ordinary - matter galaxies .",
    "the dark - matter galaxies would then play the hosts of ( visible ) ordinary - matter galaxies , like our own galaxy , the milky way .",
    "note that a dark - matter galaxy is by our definition a galaxy that does not possess any ordinary strong and electromagnetic interactions ( with our visible ordinary - matter world ) .",
    "this fundamental question deserves some thoughts , for the structural formation of our universe .    of course",
    ", we should remind ourselves that , in our ordinary - matter world , those quarks can aggregate in no time , to hadrons , including nuclei , and the electrons serve to neutralize the charges also in no time . then atoms , molecules , complex molecules , and so on .",
    "these serve as the seeds for the clusters , and then stars , and then galaxies , maybe in a time span of @xmath41 ( i.e. , the age of our young universe ) . the aggregation caused by strong and electromagnetic forces is fast enough to help giving rise to galaxies in a time span of @xmath41 . on the other hand",
    ", the seeded clusterings might proceed with abundance of extra - heavy dark - matter particles such as familons and family higgs , all greater than a few @xmath24 and with relatively long lifetimes ( owing to very limited decay channels ) .",
    "so , further simulations on galactic formation and evolution may yield clues on our problem .    finally , coming back to the fronts of particle physics , neutrinos might couple to the dark - matter particles .",
    "any further investigation along this direction would be of utmost importance .",
    "it may shed light on the nature of the dark - matter world and , eventually , we would be able to close up our world .",
