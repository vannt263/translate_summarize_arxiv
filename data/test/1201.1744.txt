    "accreting x - ray pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars in a binary system , accreting matter from their companion star . the mass transfer can take place via roche - lobe overflow , strong stellar winds for giant stars or the be emission mechanism .",
    "these accreting pulsars radiate predominantly in the x - ray band , and the radiation is modulated by the stellar rotation of the pulsar . for a review on this subject , see e.g. , nagase  @xcite .",
    "gx  1 + 4 is an accreting x - ray pulsar which was discovered in 1970 by a balloon x - ray observation at energies above 15 kev showing pulsations with a period of about two minutes ( lewin  et  al .",
    "it was one of the brightest x - ray sources in the galactic center region .",
    "the composite emission spectrum of gx  1 + 4 indicated that the object was almost certainly a binary system , consisting of a symbiotic red giant and a much hotter source ( davidsen  et  al .",
    "chakrabarty  &  roche  @xcite confirmed the optical companion to be the m giant v2116 oph .",
    "more recently , observations have shown a well - determined , 1161 day period , single - line spectroscopic binary orbit ( hinkle  et  al .",
    "the inclination of the orbit is , however , unknown .",
    "therefore , on the basis of similar characteristics seen in other x - ray binary systems the mass of the neutron star is inferred to be @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "the mass function of the system , combined with the abundances of the m giant star and the assumed mass for the neutron star , indicate a mass of @xmath3 @xmath2 for the m giant star .",
    "this implies that the m giant star is a first ascent giant which does not fill its roche lobe . in consequence , the neutron star is capturing the slow stellar wind of its companion , which makes v2116 oph quite different from other low - mass x - ray binaries ( hinkle  et  al .",
    "therein , gx  1 + 4 is the first low mass x - ray binary with an m giant optical companion , and the first symbiotic x - ray pulsar ever observed .",

    "[ gxhistdata ] which currently is the most updated and complete series of pulse periods of gx  1 + 4 .",
    "the available measurements of the pulse period of the neutron star of gx  1 + 4 span a time period of about 40 years giving us a unique insight in the pulse period evolution of this symbiotic x - ray pulsar . to obtain this result",
    "we have combined all measurements that we are aware of from the literature with the pulse periods determined from bepposax / wfc , integral / isgri and fermi / gbm data .",
    "the system has a peculiar spin history . during the 1970 s gx  1 + 4 was spinning up with the fastest rate ( @xmath4  s / s ) among the known x - ray pulsars at the time ( see e.g. , nagase  @xcite ) . during that period the source had an x - ray luminosity between @xmath5 and @xmath6  erg  s@xmath7 ( white  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) ( the luminosity value have been corrected to the distance range ( 3 - 6  kpc ) ( chakrabarty  &  roche  @xcite ) ) .",
    "however , exosat observations in 1983 revealed an extended low state with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath8  erg  s@xmath7 ( hall  &  davelar  @xcite ) . around the same time",
    "gx  1 + 4 started to spin down with a rate similar in magnitude to the previous spin - up rate ( see fig .",
    "[ gxhistdata ] ) and continues spinning down up to date .",
    "indeed , the spin down rate measured by fermi is the strongest spin down rate observed to date ( @xmath9  s / s ) , and the pulse period of the pulsar has increased by about 50% during the last @xmath10 years to the largest value ever known for this source ( @xmath11  s ) ( gonzlez - galn  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) .    apart from the long - term plot , looking at the behavior along shorter time scales ( fig .",
    "[ fluxesperiods ] ) , it is possible to observe that even when the x - ray flux has variations , pulse period evolution seems to be almost linear .    the unusual long - term spin behavior of gx  1 + 4 has attracted considerable interest for many years . studying the pulse period evolution in an accreting x - ray pulsar and relating it to , e.g. , the luminosity changes , allows to test models of accretion and to gain insights on the physical processes taking place in this kind of systems . in gonzlez - galn",
    "et  al .",
    "@xcite we extend the investigation of the spin period history of gx  1 + 4 with new observations obtained by bepposax , integral and fermi , we correlate x - ray flux variations with pulse period variations of the system using the same observations as well as those obtained with swift and batse , and provide a likely explanation for the spin history seen .",
    "standard accretion theory by ghosh  &  lamb  @xcite assumes the formation of a prograde disk around the neutron star . this prograde disk accelerates the neutron star through the angular momentum of the accreted matter .",
    "therefore , spin down of the pulsar is only possible in the quasi - equilibrium state , and there is a positive correlation between accretion rate ( @xmath12 ) and the acceleration of the neutron star . assuming @xmath13 , the positive correlation @xmath14 should be observed in the data even during spin down .",
    "transient disks with an alternating sense of rotation are known to form in numerical simulations in binary systems fed from stellar wind ( fryxell  &  taam  @xcite ) , therefore it is also possible the formation of a transient retrograde disk in gx  1 + 4 as it is a wind - fed source .",
    "indeed , a retrograde accretion disk was proposed for the first time by makishima  et  al .",
    "@xcite to explain the spin down observed in the neutron star of gx  1 + 4 .",
    "this model assumes a retrograde disk around the neutron star decelerating the pulsar through the angular momentum of accreted matter , therein , a negative correlation @xmath15 should be observed in the data .",
    "there is a third model proposed for the first time to explain the behavior of gx  1 + 4 in gonzlez - galn  et  al .",
    "@xcite , the quasi - spherical accretion model .",
    "this model predicts a quasi - static atmosphere around the neutron star ( instead of a disk ) which carries away angular momentum from the neutron star magnetosphere but allows accretion ( in contrast to the so - called subsonic propeller regime ( davies & pringle@xcite ) ) ; and a negative correlation ( @xmath15 ) during spin down ( see shakura  et  al .",
    "@xcite ; postnov  et  al .",
    "the formation of this kind of `` atmosphere '' is only possible for wind - fed sources like gx  1 + 4 .",
    "the discrete correlation function between @xmath16 obtained from fermi / gbm gx  1 + 4 data and the swift / bat 15 - 50 kev x - ray flux shown in bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fluxesperiods ] . the minimum near zero lag implies a negative correlation between the pulse frequency derivative and the x - ray flux ( gonzlez - galn  et  al .",
    "@xcite).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the correlations between x - ray flux and pulse period evolution predicted by the models proposed in section  [ theoretical ] can be tested by comparison with a regular sequence of x - ray fluxes and pulse periods which can be found in batse and fermi data ( see fig .  [ fluxesperiods ] ) for gx  1 + 4 .    a cross - correlation of @xmath17 obtained from fermi / gbm data and the contemporaneous x - ray flux measured by swift / bat finds a minimum near zero lag ( see fig .  [ crosscorr ] ) implying a negative correlation between this two parameters for gx  1 + 4 .",
    "furthermore , this negative correlation has already been found previously in batse data ( i.e. chakrabarty  et  al .",
    "this negative correlation discards the standard accretion disk model as a possible interpretation of gx  1 + 4 behavior .",
    "due to several reasons , including this negative correlation , different authors have tried to explain gx  1 + 4 behavior assuming the formation of a retrograde disk around the neutron star by matter captured from stellar wind of the secondary m - giant star in gx  1 + 4 ( e.g. makishima  et  al .",

    "@xcite , nelson  et  al .",
    "@xcite , ferrigno  et  al .",
    "@xcite , etc . ) .",
    "the weak points of the retrograde disk interpretation , however , include the puzzling long - term ( @xmath10 years ) stability of such a retrograde disk .    this puzzling long - term stability of the retrograde disk interpretation has led us to a new model , the quasi - spherical accretion model , which is able to explain the negative correlation found in the data without the formation a retrograde accretion disk ( gonzlez - galn  et  al .",
    "new measurements by integral and fermi confirm the overall spin down of the neutron star in gx 1 + 4 observed over the last decades .",
    "this spin down is stronger than ever observed before with an increasement of the spin period of @xmath18 during the last @xmath10 years ( gonzlez - galn  et  al .",
    "the analysis of fermi data reveals a negative correlation between spin frequency derivative and the x - ray flux simultaneously measured by swift / bat monitor ( gonzlez - galn  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , which confirms the correlation of instantaneous spin - down torque with x - ray flux discovered by batse ( chakrabarty  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) discarding clearly the standard accretion disk model for this system .",
    "we have shown that in gx 1 + 4 not only the retrograde disk accretion is a possible explanation but the quasi - spherical accretion onto the neutron star from the stellar wind of the m giant companion is likely to take place ( gonzlez - galn  et  al .",
