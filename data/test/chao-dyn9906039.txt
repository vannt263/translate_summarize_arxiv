    "the ` lock and key ' concept has been central to understanding the specificity of biochemical molecular interactions , from enzyme - substrate relationships to antigen - antibody matchings . however , it has gradually been realized that such a ` lock and key ' concept is not strictly valid , particularly in immune systems @xcite .",
    "antigen - antibody interactions are found to be plastic or ` multispecific ' rather than fixed or single - specific .",
    "namely , antibodies inherently have a flexible recognition capacity .",
    "kearney et al.@xcite have confirmed experimentally the existence of such ambiguity of recognition in the antibody binding site of immature b cells .",
    "it is generally believed that development from ambiguous to specific recognition is caused by somatic hypermutations @xcite .",
    "we here propose a new dynamics of specificity evolutions based on jerne s network hypothesis @xcite .",
    "our model is characterized by a meta - dynamics of idiotype specificity on shape - space @xcite .",
    "we show here that specific and non - specific responses to an antigen are governed dynamically by a fixed point attractor and a chaotic long - lived transient state of an immune network , respectively .",
    "the relevance of such a long - lived transient state is discussed with respect to immune function .",
    "we first introduce the standard idiotypic network model . each idiotype is characterized by a pair of surface sites , called the idiotope and the paratope .",
    "if the idiotope site of a lymph cell is bounded by paratopes of other lymph cells , the recognized lymph cells become inactivated , whereas the recognizing cells become activated .",
    "thus the growth dynamics of clone size @xmath0 of an idiotype of paratope @xmath1 and idiotope @xmath2 is given as ,    @xmath3    the idiotope - paratope interaction @xmath4 is assumed to have an exponential form : @xmath5 .",
    "we characterize the ambiguity of the antigen - antibody by the deviation parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the proposed meta - dynamics controls this parameter .",
    "first , as a simple example , we quantize @xmath6 by the power of 2 : @xmath7 .",
    "the maximum specificity is given by @xmath8 .",
    "now each idiotype is characterized by three variables : idiotope @xmath1 , paratope @xmath2 , and the specificity @xmath9 .",
    "we thus describe the evolution of specificity as follows :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the mutation rate of specificity . here",
    "the source term @xmath12 is added for the least specific antibody .",
    "this dependency reflects the fact that the premature b - cells are believed to have lower specificities .    by combining these equations",
    ", we establish the complete clone growth dynamics with mutations among idiotypes and the evolution of the specificities .    in our model",
    ", there are five different types of idiotopes and of paratopes , so that there are 25 different idiotypes , with @xmath13 different levels of specificity . the rest of the system parameters ( i.e. @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 )",
    "are selected so that the size of each clone never diverges .",
    "the following results ( especially , the natural tolerance at high amount of antigen ) are confirmed not to depend on the values of the mutation rate @xmath11 and the source @xmath18 .",
    "the dependency of system size is still unclear .",
    "we pay most attention to how the idiotype network responds to persistent antigenic stimulations . a static antigen with a binding site @xmath1 is introduced by adding the constant term @xmath19 to the above equation .",
    "estimating the mean network specificity @xmath20 by averaging the specificity of all idiotypes bearing paratope type _",
    "k _ , we study the antigenic effect on the network dynamics .",
    "an antigen of type 4 is used as an example , but the following result does not depend on the selected antigen type . because we adopt the periodic boundary condition for the shape - space , each idiotype is equivalent within a network .",
    "we show a plot of the averaged specificity ( @xmath21 ) and the maximum lyapunov exponent under the antigen stimulations over @xmath22 steps ( see fig .",
    "[ sp_lyap](a ) , ( b ) ) .",
    "[ prob ]    in fig.[sp_lyap](a ) , as expected , the network specificity increases when we increase the amount of antigen . at about 9.5 units of antigen",
    ", however , the specificity abruptly diverges to a high value .",
    "we say that a specific response has occurred at this antigen level .",
    "this specific response is observed until the antigen level reaches 13.5 units . beyond this critical value , the specific response is no longer observed .",
    "inversely , the specificity is sustained at the lower values .",
    "this lower sustained response can be compared to natural tolerance to the antigen .    on the other hand , by comparing fig.[sp_lyap](a ) with ( b ) , when the amount of the antigen is set between 9.5 and 13.5 units , we notice that the lower specificity emerges with chaotic dynamics , and the higher specificity emerges with a fixed point dynamics .",
    "we shall call the former dynamics a type i attractor and the latter a type ii attractor .",
    "however , the type i attractor is not a true attractor .",
    "it was found to be a long - lived transient state referred to as a _ super - transient state _ , which is a common phenomenon in high - dimensional dynamical systems @xcite . in fig.[prob](c ) , when the observation period is extended , we observe a transition from type i to type ii attractor .",
    "there is no inverse - transition from the type ii to the type i attractor .",
    "the super - transient states are highly dependent on the antigen level .",
    "for example , when the antigen level is 11.5 units in fig.[prob](c ) , the transition probability from type i to type ii is still less than 12 percent . in such cases",
    ", it behaves as an attractor in a practical sense .    from a practical viewpoint ,",
    "response time is also worth noticing .",
    "if we say that the relevant time scale for the immune response should be less than 10,000 time steps , in a practical sense there is no specific response even at higher levels of antigen ( see fig.[prob](c ) ) .",
    "our results suggest that a certain level of antigen causes the super - transient state to suppress fast immune responses under the idiotype network .        besides the response time",
    ", much attention has been paid in the field of theoretical immunology to topological changes of the network @xcite . here",
    "we argue that the transition from type i ( unspecific ) to type ii ( specific ) causes a simultaneous change of network topology .",
    "the network topology of each of these two states is shown in fig.[topology ] .    as we see from the figure",
    ", a chaotic super - transient state of type i has a more complex network than does type ii",
    ". inversely , higher specificity to the dosed antigen is maintained by a simpler network structure .",
    "the maintenance of idiotypic diversity can be attributed to chaotic dynamics .    by estimating the amount of specificity of all idiotypes in the type i s distributed state and the type ii s localized state respectively",
    ", it is found that each idiotype in type i s distributed state has a low specificity on the whole .",
    "namely , each idiotype interacts weakly with many idiotypes in order to have high connectivity . as a result",
    ", the stimulation of the network by dosed antigen is distributed over the network , not concentrated only on idiotypes bearing a binding site ( paratope with type 4 ) for the antigen .",
    "thus , the immune response to the antigen has a tendency to be suppressed .",
    "this result would support stewart s extrapolation that ` the higher connectivity among idiotypes , the greater the degree of tolerance ' @xcite .",
    "recently , a chaotic oscillation was found experimentally in a natural tolerant state .",
    "subsequently , theoretical immunologists have tried to establish ` natural tolerance under chaotic dynamics ' against a static antigen @xcite , though their simulation results show difficulty establishing such a tolerance without assuming a special network topology of an ` odd - loop structure ' and so - called ` bell - shaped function ' as an activation function .",
    "we have shown how such a tolerance can arise naturally under a chaotic dynamics , without these assumptions , by adding an additional flexibility ; i.e. , meta - mutation dynamics with specificity of idiotype .",
    "we have used a simple idiotypic network model , and have not ventured to use the more complex ",
    "bell - shaped function model because of focusing on capabilities of the meta - dynamics we introduced . applying the meta - dynamics we introduced here with the bell - shaped function model",
    "is left as a future problem .",
    "in this paper , we have expanded the possibilities of theoretical immunology by introducing new meta - dynamics .",
    "we believe that the immune response should be seen as having a more dynamic nature than allowed by most current models @xcite , and that the specific antigen - response and the dynamical percolation related to natural tolerance are caused by the meta - dynamics controlling the degree of specificity , as introduced here ."
