    "recent high resolution x - ray observations reveal that there are large number of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) in many nearby galaxies .",
    "ulxs are usually defined as very bright ( @xmath3 ) off - nucleus , variable x - ray sources in galaxies .",
    "since the luminosity exceeds the eddington luminosity of a @xmath4 black hole ( bh ) , ulxs are considered to be candidates for intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) .",
    "more recently , a number of ulxs have been found to be supersoft ; their x - ray spectra can be fitted with a blackbody model with temperature of less than 100 ev ( e.g. , swartz et al .",

    "we report a series of _ chandra _  observations of the ultraluminous sss in m101 ( cxouj140332.3 + 542103 ) from the low state ( kong & distefano 2004 ) to outburst ( kong 2004a , 2004b ) . shortly after the discovery of the outburst",
    ", we initiated a multiwavelength campaign to monitor the source .",
    "we here also present the results of an _ xmm - newton _  follow - up observation conducted about two weeks after the first outburst observation .",
    "the primary result of radio observations by the very large array was reported by rupen , sjouwerman , & kong ( 2004 ) .",
    "we will present the detailed analysis of the optical and radio observations in a follow - up paper .",
    "m101 was observed by _ chandra _  in 2004 january , march , may , and july .",
    "table 1 summarizes the _ chandra _  observations .",
    "we also list the two _ chandra _  observations taken in 2000 march and 2000 october , and the follow - up _ xmm - newton _  observation ( see  2.2 ) . in all observations , the center of m101 and the ultraluminous sss",
    "are in the s3 chip of the acis - s .",
    "all data were taken in very faint mode ( vfaint ) .",
    "we reprocessed the raw data to utilize the vfaint mode and to remove the 0.5-pixel randomization .",
    "however , for data taken during the outburst , we found that vfaint processing flagged some source events of the sss as background and we therefore did not apply vfaint processing for the data taken in july . in order to reduce the instrumental background , we screened the data to allow only photon energies in the range of 0.37 kev .",
    "we also searched for periods of high background using source free regions in the s1 chip and filtered all the high background periods .",
    "only the 2004 january 24 and 2004 may 7 observations were affected ; the exposure times listed in table 1 correspond to the good time intervals .",
    "all data were reduced and analyzed with the ciao v3.1 package , and calibration database caldb 2.27 .      shortly after the discovery of the outburst of cxouj140332.3 + 542103  with _ chandra _ , we requested _ xmm - newton _  director s discretionary time for a follow - up observation .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  observation was taken on 2004 july 23 for 30 ks , and the instrument modes were full - frame , medium filter for the three european photon imaging cameras ( epic ) .",
    "after rejecting those intervals with a high background level , we considered a good time interval of @xmath5 ks .",
    "only data in 0.212 kev were used for analysis .",
    "data were reduced and analyzed with the _ xmm - newton _  sas package v5.4.1 .",
    "we performed spectral analysis for all _ chandra _  data taken between 2004 january and 2004 july .",
    "the two datasets taken in 2000 were reported in mukai et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and distefano & kong ( 2003 ) .",
    "spectral analysis was performed by using sherpa .",
    "we also used xspec v11.3 for independent check . in each observation , we extracted the source spectrum from a @xmath6 radius circular region centered on the source , while an annulus region centered on the source was used as the background . during the outburst , there are enough photons to rebin the spectra with at least 15 counts per spectral bin , and used @xmath7 statistics to find the best - fitting parameters . for the data during the low state ( january , march , and may ) ,",
    "very few source photons were received ( @xmath8 ) in each observation , we therefore performed spectral analysis with unbinned data ( background not subtracted ) for which c - statistics ( cash 1979 ) were employed . to examine the low state spectrum in detail , we also combined all the low state data to perform spectral fit with binned data and @xmath7 statistics .",
    "we tried power - law , blackbody , and disk blackbody models with interstellar absorption .",

    "cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the low state data , power - law models provide better fits than blackbody models .",
    "each low - state observation is consistent with an absorbed power - law model ; the photon index ranges from @xmath9 among the observations , with an average of 1.8 .",
    "the @xmath10 converged to zero and we therefore fixed it at the galactic value ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the @xmath13 kev luminosity is about @xmath14 .",
    "fixing the @xmath10 at a higher value ( @xmath15 @xmath12 ; see below ) , the luminosity is about a factor of 2 higher . the combined low state data , however , can not be fitted with any single - component model .",
    "a simple power - law model produces a soft excess .",
    "we therefore fitted the spectrum with a composite blackbody and power - law model ( @xmath16 @xmath12 , @xmath17 ev , and @xmath18 ; see table 2 ) ; the power - law component contributes roughly @xmath19 ( 30% ) of the absorbed ( unabsorbed ) 0.37 kev flux .    during the 2004 outburst ,",
    "blackbody models provide good fits to the spectra .",
    "disk blackbody model is also equally acceptable ; the inner disk temperatures are slightly higher than the blackbody temperatures , but the normalizations ( hence the inner disk radii ) often have large error ranges . in general , the blackbody temperatures are between @xmath20 ev , and the @xmath10 is about @xmath21 @xmath12 , significantly higher than the galactic value . we also fitted the spectra with the @xmath10 fixed at @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "however , all the fits are unacceptable with reduced @xmath7 between 1.5 and 2.4 .",
    "the 0.37 kev luminosity ranges from @xmath22  to @xmath23 .",
    "we also derived the bolometric luminosity from the normalization of the blackbody model and it is between @xmath24  and @xmath2 . in two cases ,",
    "the spectra are complex and single component models can not provide good fits to the data .",
    "we included two absorption edges in each case and the fits were significantly improved . specifically , we found absorption edges at 0.66 kev and 0.87 kev on 2004 july 6 but the edges were not observed on 2004 july 8 .",
    "instead , we found two new edges at 0.33 kev and 0.56 kev .",
    "we used similar techniques to analyze the _ xmm - newton _  data .",
    "we extracted the source spectrum from a @xmath25 radius circle centered on the source .",
    "the source was fainter than previous _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations with about 160 background - subtracted counts in epic - pn .",
    "since the source was detected only in epic - pn , we fitted the epic - pn spectrum with several single - component models .",
    "however , all the fits are unacceptable .",
    "we therefore fitted the spectrum with a composite blackbody and power - law model .",
    "the model consists of a supersoft component ( 53 ev ) and a hard power - law tail ( @xmath26 ) ; the power - law component contributes about 40% ( 8% ) of the 0.37 kev absorbed ( unabsorbed ) flux .",
    "the 0.37 kev luminosity is @xmath27 , indicating that the source was in the decay stage of the outburst .",
    "notes  all quoted uncertainties are 90% confidence .",
    "sources without reduced @xmath7 and dof values were fitted with unbinned data using cash statistics ; `` goodness - of - fit '' determined by monte - carlo simulations ( mc ) is employed and parameters of both blackbody and power - law models are shown .",
    "+ @xmath28 in units of @xmath29 @xmath12 .",
    "+ @xmath30 for low state data , we list the probability that the best fit model would produce a lower value of the cash statistics than that calculated from the data , as determined via xspec monte - carlo simulations .",
    "a best fit model should have a value of about 0.5 .",
    "+ @xmath31 0.37 kev luminosity ( @xmath32 ) , assuming 6.7 mpc ( freedman et al . 2001 ) .",

    "+ @xmath34 fixed + @xmath35 combined low - state data modeled by an absorbed power - law and blackbody model .",
    "although over @xmath36 ulxs have been discovered ( miller & colbert 2003 ) , only a handful of sources have @xmath37 ergs s@xmath38 , assuming isotropic radiation ( matsumoto et al .",
    "2001 ; gao et al . 2003",
    "; davis & mushotzky 2004 ; soria & motch 2004 ) . a luminosity this high is difficult to achieve in an x - ray binary unless the accretor has a mass greater than roughly @xmath39 we do have evidence that cxouj140332.3 + 542103is likely to be an x - ray binary , since its luminosity has been observed to change by a factor of @xmath40 on a time scale of hours ( mukai et al .",
    "2003 ; distefano & kong 2003 ) . while it is possible that our luminosity estimates are higher than the true luminosity , the effects that lead to overestimates , such as beaming , or various anisotropies , tend to change estimated luminosities downward by a factor of roughly @xmath41 its unusually high bolometric luminosity ( @xmath42 ergs s@xmath38 ) , coupled with its short - time - scale time variability , therefore make cxouj140332.3 + 542103a good candidate for an accreting imbh . for instance , king et al .",
    "( 2001 ) proposed that anisotropic x - ray emission can result super - eddington luminosity for a stellar - mass bh .",
    "however , in order to achieve such a high luminosity for a stellar - mass bh , extreme beaming is required and the disk is expected to be much hotter .",
    "similarly , the temperature of radiation pressure - dominated accretion disk model proposed by begelman ( 2002 ) is too high .",
    "the pure blackbody spectrum also makes relativistically beaming ( krding et al .",
    "2002 ) unlikely .",
    "its soft spectrum in the high state is another important piece of evidence .",
    "an accretion disk around a very massive bh is expected to produce supersoft x - ray emission ( see distefano & kong 2002 ) .",
    "for instance , if the supersoft emission comes from the inner disk , a 70 ev sss at luminosity of @xmath23 corresponds to a @xmath43 bh .",
    "if we used the 90% lower limits of the inner disk temperature derived from the disk blackbody fits , the bh mass is estimated to be @xmath44 ( makishima et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this is consistent with prior work on imbh models for ulxs ( see e.g. , miller & colbert 2003 )",
    ". it also complements other work on evidence for cool disks in ulxs that has also been considered as evidence for imbh models ( miller et al .",
    "2003,2004 ) although a power - law component usually contributes a significant fraction of x - ray emission .",
    "furthermore , the high state luminosity is approximately @xmath45 of the eddington luminosity for a @xmath46 bh ; we therefore expect the inner disk to be optically thick , which is consistent with the imbh interpretation .",
    "the state changes of cxouj140332.3 + 542103  span a luminosity range larger than a factor of @xmath47 cxouj140332.3 + 542103   was first detected by _",
    "rosat _  in 1996",
    "november ( wang et al . 1999 ) , with an extrapolated unabsorbed 0.37 kev luminosity of @xmath48  ( blackbody model with @xmath49 @xmath12 , @xmath50 ev ) .",
    "higher absorption ( @xmath51 @xmath12 ) would imply a luminosity up of @xmath52 .",
    "the source was not detected in other _",
    "rosat_observations ( see wang et al .",
    "1999 ) . in a 108 ks _ rosat _",
    "hri observation taken in 1996 may / june , we can set a @xmath53 detection limit at @xmath54  ( power - law model with @xmath55 @xmath12 and @xmath56 ) . setting the @xmath10 at @xmath15 @xmath12 ,",
    "the luminosity limit becomes @xmath57 . in 2000",
    "march and october , _ chandra _  detected the sss in the very soft state with luminosities of @xmath58  ( mukai et al .",
    "2003 ; distefano & kong 2003 ) . in 2002 june , _ xmm - newton _  observed m101 and did not detect the sss ( jenkins et al .",
    "we re - analysed the image and found that the sss may be barely detected with possible contamination from nearby sources .",
    "we derived the 0.37 kev luminosity of the sss as @xmath59 , by assuming a power - law model .",
    "the source was also in the low state between 2004 january and may with luminosity of @xmath60 .",
    "it is clear that the sss has had at least three major outbursts ( @xmath61 ) . on the other hand , the very low luminosities ( @xmath59 ) during 2002 and 2004",
    "indicate that the source was in the low state .",
    "the source varies by as much as a factor of 1000 between the low state and the high state .",
    "this amplitude is even greater than many galactic bhs .",
    "remarkably , the source also shows spectral changes .",
    "it is very clear that there is a power - law component ( @xmath18 ) in the composite low state spectrum , while the high state spectra are supersoft .",
    "our _ xmm - newton _  observation taken during the decay of the outburst revealed that the blackbody component was still strong and there was a very hard power - law tail , similar to the low state . while it is difficult to make direct comparison with galactic bhs because of the blackbody emission in the low state and the pure blackbody spectrum in the high state ( see however zdziarski & gierlinski 2004 ) , it is unusual for a sss to have high / very soft state and low / hard state transition . with a peak bolometric luminosity @xmath62 ,",
    "it is likely that imbh is the central engine of the system .",
    "interestingly , the blackbody component is always seen while the power - law component becomes stronger when the source is at lower luminosities .",
    "it may indicate that the power - law component is due to comptonization of soft photons ( wang et al .",
    "the photon index is , however , harder than that of galactic bhs in the low state ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "none of the galactic bhs has similar spectrum ( mcclintock & remillard 2003 ) .",
    "the closest example is galactic microquasar v4641 sgr for which the photon index was measured to be between 0.6 and 1.3 ( miller et al .",
    "2002 ; mcclintock & remillard 2003 ) .",
    "another important feature of our x - ray spectral fits is the presence of absorption edges , which we found at 0.33 , 0.57 , 0.66 , and 0.88 kev in two of the high state spectra .",
    "these are consistent with c v , n vi , n vii , and o viii edges .",
    "we note , however , that the 0.33 kev edge may be due to calibration of the acis - s near the carbon edge around 0.28 kev .",
    "these features may signal the presence of highly ionized gas in the vicinity of the accretor ( e.g. , warm absorber ) , and may be consistent with an outflow from the source .",
    "in fact , outflow models have been suggested for ulxs .",
    "king and pounds ( 2003 ) suggested that the soft component of some ulxs is due to outflow of a stellar - mass bh .",
    "mukai et al .",
    "( 2003 ) also used similar argument to explain the super - eddington luminosity of cxouj140332.3 + 542103 .",
    "however , the new data which reveal the changes of temperature and bolometric luminosity , the extremely high luminosity , and the state transition of the source will be difficult to explain by such a model .",
    "it remains a puzzle that we saw different edges in the two observations , possibly related to the geometry of the system .",
    "nevertheless , outflows from imbhs may be expected .",
    "it is also interesting to note that similar absorption edges are expected and have been observed in white dwarf ( wds ) systems such as the recurrent nova u sco ( kahabka et al .",
    "1999 ) , cal  87 and rx  j0925.74758 ( ebisawa et al .",
    "sss radiation with luminosities in the range from @xmath64 ergs s@xmath38 to roughly the eddington limit for a @xmath65 wd are expected for nuclear burning wds ( van den heuvel et al . 1992 ) .",
    "indeed , such models have been proposed to explain ssss in the galaxy and magellanic clouds .",
    "note , however , that neutron star and bh models have also been proposed .",
    "the high state luminosity of this source is almost two orders of magnitude larger than that of any other known sss , and it rules out steady nuclear burning on hot wd models as an explanation for cxouj140332.3 + 542103 .",
    "a similar argument can be made for neutron star models .",
    "a nova explosion could explain some features of the data .",
    "it is not favored , however , because the photospheric radius and lack of hard radiation at the peak of the outburst have no obvious explanation .",
    "it may be impossible to conclusively establish , using current technology , that any x - ray source in an external galaxy is an imbh . a system like cxouj140332.3",
    "+ 542103  is therefore particularly valuable , because it provides @xmath66 different pieces of evidence that together make a consistent argument in favor of an imbh interpretation .",
    "its high - state luminosity , its short - time - scale variability , its soft high - state spectrum , and its pronounced spectral changes , all suggest that cxouj140332.3 + 542103  is a strong imbh candidate .",
