    "a decade ago , solar models matched the sun remarkably well .",
    "sound speed profiles in models differed from the sun s actual sound speed by less than half a percent",
    ". then @xcite reanalyzed the solar optical spectrum using improved atomic physics and a 3d hydrodynamical model of the atmosphere ( instead of a 1d hydrostatic model ) .",
    "their results indicate that the abundances of the heavy elements should be lower by a substantial amount .",
    "for example , carbon was lowered by 35% , nitrogen by 27.5% , oxygen by 48% , and neon by 74% .",
    "solar models that are evolved using the new abundance mixture give worse agreement with helioseismic constraints than models using the old abundances .",
    "problems include a tripling in the sound - speed discrepency below the convection zone , a convection zone that is too shallow , and a helium abundance in the convection zone that is too low .",
    "many attempts have been made to reconcile the new abundances with seismology .",
    "a few examples include increasing the opacities below the convection zone , increasing abundances within their uncertainties , increasing the neon abundance , enhancing diffusive settling rates , and including early accretion of lower - z material .",
    "various combinations of these changes have also been explored .",
    "none of the alterations has resolved the discrepency between the revised abundances and seismology . for further discussion of the problem and the attempted solutions ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite in these proceedings .",
    "since the mismatch between seismology and the new abundances remains a problem , a seismic determination of the heavy element abundances in the solar convection zone is necessary .",
    "the techniques for a seismic measurement of heavy elements are discussed in the following sections .",
    "@xcite measured the solar helium abundance through the effect of helium ionization on the adiabatic exponent @xmath0 .",
    "ionization lowers @xmath0 from the ideal gas value of 5/3 .",
    "since the convection zone stratification is almost purely adiabatic , the gradient of the square of the sound speed in that region can be written as @xmath1   \\right\\}.\\ ] ] this expression can be separated into a term called @xmath2 that contains the seismic variables and a term called @xmath3 that contains only thermodynamic variables .",
    "@xmath4 @xmath5\\ ] ] since @xmath3 contains a derivative of @xmath0 , it shows a more pronounced variation due to the ionization of each element than @xmath0 alone shows . for the helium abundance measurement , dppen and",
    "gough used seismic data to obtain the sound speed , then computed @xmath2 and @xmath3 for their model .",
    "figure [ figone ] shows the helium hump that dppen and gough discovered in @xmath2 and @xmath3 where ionization takes place in the convection zone . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are ploted against the acoustic radius @xmath6 .",
    "the signatures of heavy - element ionization can already be seen in the small wiggles lower in the convection zone @xcite .",
    "near @xmath7 , we see ionization . from 0.45 - 0.55 , ionization appears .",
    "near 0.58 , shows up as an imperceptibly small hump that is impossible to measure here .",
    "near 0.68 , there is a double hump due to the first two k - shell ionizations of ne .",
    "the larger humps are merged ionization zones .",
    "since the humps from heavy element ionization are such small features , great care must be taken to obtain an accurate measurement of the abundances .     and",
    "@xmath3 throughout the convection zone in model s of @xcite .",
    "the large hump around @xmath8 is due to helium ionization .",
    "the smaller wiggles lower in the convection zone are due to heavy element ionization . ]",
    "it is common to use sound speed and density or sound speed and @xmath0 as solar inversion variables .",
    "however , the extremely small ionization humps of the heavy elements require a more sensitive inversion .",
    "we suggest inverting the frequency differences directly for @xmath2 and @xmath3 . @xmath9 in the adiabatically stratified convection zone , @xmath10 .",
    "this allows us to rewrite the integral as @xmath11 since this formulation has the added advantage of reducing the problem to a single - variable inversion , we no longer need to worry about contamination from a second inversion variable .",
    "the conversion from the familiar sound speed and density kernels ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the desired @xmath2 and @xmath3 kernels requires quite a bit of algebra .",
    "one possible trick to simplify the calculation is to reconfigure @xmath2 and @xmath3 in terms of the square of the isothermal sound speed @xmath12 .",
    "the gradient of @xmath13 in an adiabatically stratified region is @xmath14 this leads to a set of definitions analogous to equations ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) for the separation of seismic and thermodynamic variables : @xmath15 @xmath16 the derivative of @xmath0 in the definition of @xmath3 does not appear in the new @xmath17 .",
    "this greatly simplifies the kernel conversion .",
    "however , without the @xmath0 derivative , @xmath17 is less sensitive to the effects of ionization than @xmath3 is .",
    "as shown in figure [ figtwo ] , @xmath17 does not have visible heavy - element ionization humps . since the effect of ionization is so small to begin with ,",
    "reducing it even further by switching to @xmath17 is not worth the gain in algebraic simplicity in the kernel conversion .",
    "the @xmath0 derivative is essential to highlight the effect of heavy - element ionization .",
    "we therefore choose to use the original definitions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .     and @xmath17 throughout the convection zone in model s of @xcite .",
    "the heavy - element ionization humps are clearly visible in @xmath3 , yet they do not appear in @xmath17 . ]",
    "one source of uncertainty in solar equations of state is the effect of pressure ionization .",
    "pressure ionization occurs when matter is so dense that electron orbits overlap .",
    "the electrons in the overlapping orbits no longer belong to a particular atomic nucleus .",
    "the pressure effectively frees these electrons , increasing the ionization of the plasma .",
    "@xcite developed a technique to account for pressure ionization in an equation of state by applying constraints to the effective atomic and ionic sizes .",
    "they used a single pressure - ionization parameter @xmath18 for all species of ions .",
    "they then implemented a model in which they calibrated @xmath18 to fit solar data .",
    "the calibrated pressure - ionization model fit the data better than the parameter - free equations of state , highlighting the importance of pressure ionization for an accurate equation of state .    changing the effective atomic size in the pressure - ionization model leads to a vertical shift in @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath0 appears as a factor in @xmath3 , @xmath3 also suffers from this shift due to the atomic size parameterization .",
    "therefore , we can not just measure the average value of @xmath3 to obtain the heavy - element abundances . in order to obtain an accurate seismological measurement",
    ", we must consider the effective atomic size by using a pressure - ionization model for the equation of state or measure the humps relative to the background level of @xmath3 .",
    "in order to obtain a seismic measurement of the heavy - element abundances in the sun the following techniques should be used : the frequency data should be inverted directly for @xmath2 or @xmath3 instead of sound speed , the original definitions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 should be used instead of the @xmath19 and @xmath17 derived from the isothermal sound speed formulation , and the effect of atomic size calibration on the background level of @xmath3 should be taken into account .",
