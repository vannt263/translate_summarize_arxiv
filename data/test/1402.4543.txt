    "complex grassmann manifold has found its extensive applications in multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) wireless communication [ 1]-[5 ] in the last ten years .",
    "many of these applications focused on solving grassmann packing or quantization problems for better performance in codebook design [ 3]-[5 ] , where the eigenspace of the wireless channel matrix is modeled as a point in complex grassmann manifold .",
    "there are also published works on theoretic analyses of the quantization bound on the complex grassmann manifold [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] . for the latter",
    ", the normalized volume of hyperball needs to be calculated .",
    "various of approximated volume formulas were obtained in [ 6]-[11 ] and used extensively , where the estimation results in [ 8 ] were extensively applied and accurate enough for these applications .",
    "however , they are not suitable for some other special applications , e.g. , when the normalized hyperball volume is used as the probability of the distance between any two points in complex grassmann manifold [ 5 ] , [ 12 ] . hence , a more precise normalized volume formula of hyperball in complex grassmann manifold is needed .",
    "large - scale mimo or massive mimo system was firstly introduced in [ 13 ] where the base station ( bs ) is equipped with dozens to several hundreds transmit antennas .",
    "it has received enormous attention due to its ability of providing linear capacity growth without the need of increased power or bandwidth [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .",
    "this advantage is realized by employing multi - user mimo ( mu - mmo ) which simultaneously beam - forms to many users . in this system",
    ", the bs selects users at each scheduling slot and transmits data to these users on the same time and frequency resource . in order to remove the mutual interference among these users and maximize the multi - user channel capacity ,",
    "the bs needs to know the channel state information ( csi ) and channel quality information ( cqi ) of each user .",
    "however , in practical systems , e.g. , 3rd generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) long term evolution - advanced ( lte - a ) [ 15 ] , there always exists unavoidable errors in csi estimation because of the limited feedback bandwidth in frequency - division duplexing ( fdd ) systems or the noise and interference in the measured results of time - division duplexing ( tdd ) systems . on the other hand",
    ", the bs generally only knows the cqi of each user in single - user mimo ( su - mimo ) mode but not in mu - mimo mode because it is impractical for the system to actually measure the cqi in mu - mimo mode .",
    "therefore , even if zero - forcing ( zf ) precoding is used at the bs side for mu - mimo , there is still residual interference due to inaccurate csi in this situation . as a result",
    ", it affects mu - mimo systems in two aspects .",
    "firstly , the real sinr at each receiver side is greatly changed compared to the sinr of su - mimo mode , hence a reasonable estimation of each user s real sinr is needed so that it could be used to properly select each user s data transmission rate ( e.g. , the modulation scheme and channel coding rate ) in mu - mimo mode .",
    "secondly , as the channel capacity of each user in mu - mimo mode is smaller than su - mimo mode because of not only the decrease of transmit power but also the residual interference , it requires us to forecast the system throughput gain achieved by mu - mimo cautiously .",
    "especially , when the error of csi is large , mu - mimo may have no advantage compared to su - mimo but significantly increase system complexity .",
    "therefore , how to choose the proper modulation order and channel coding rate and to predict the capacity of mu - mimo with non - ideal csi is a fundamental question in actual mu - mimo communication systems .",
    "however , there are only a few papers analyzing the real sinr and capacity for mu - mimo in practical systems . in [ 16 ] , a cursory sinr prediction scheme was presented for some specific scenarios . in [ 17 ] , the cumulative density function ( cdf ) of sinr with ideal csi for mu - mimo was derived but the errors in practical systems were not considered .    in this paper , precise normalized volume formulas of hyperball based on two general distance definitions ( projective - frobenius norm and projective-2 norm )",
    "are obtained by applying the probability density function of canonical angle between any two points in complex grassmann manifold introduced in [ 18 ] .",
    "simulation results show that they have very high accuracy thus verified their reasonableness .",
    "one of the formulas is applied to estimate the sinrs in large - scale mu - mimo communication systems based on su - mimo sinrs . in various simulated cases , our analytical expressions of sinrs",
    "match the real values in the actual system almost perfectly .",
    "it indicates that these expressions could be used to forecast the mu - mimo sinrs and the capacity gain over su - mimo .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , the foundation of complex grassmann manifold is introduced in section i. the hyperball volume formula for various cases based on different definitions of norm distances is proposed in section ii , and simulation results are given to demonstrate accuracy . in section iii , we apply the formula to estimate the sinrs in large - scale mu - mimo systems and approximation expressions are derived .",
    "simulation results are provided for verification .",
    "finally , in section iv , conclusions are drawn .",
    "in this section , we first provide the definitions of complex grassmann manifold and the distance on it .",
    "then , the normalized volume of hyperball in grassmann manifold is introduced , and the equivalent relation between cdf of distance in the manifold and normalized volume of hyperball is constructed .",
    "finally , the normalized volume formula is obtained for various cases .      in complex vector space @xmath0 ,",
    "the set of all @xmath1 matrices with mutually orthogonal columns where each column has unit norm are defined as complex stiefel manifold , i.e. , @xmath2 an equivalent relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is constructed on @xmath5 as @xmath6 for any @xmath7 if @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the unitary group with order @xmath11 .",
    "based on the equivalent relation , a quotient space of @xmath5 is expressed as @xmath12 we call the quotient space @xmath13 complex grassmann manifold . in this paper ,",
    "a point is used to represent a matrix in @xmath5 or @xmath14 , then all the points which are equivalent in @xmath5 are denoted by anyone of them .",
    "if we call this point the effective point , then @xmath13 is made of all the effective points in @xmath5 .",
    "according to the definition , a point in @xmath13 is a @xmath15-dimensional subspace of @xmath16 , while all the equivalent points in @xmath5 represent different bases for the same @xmath15-dimensional subspace .      in order to study the volume on @xmath13",
    ", we have to define the distance on it .",
    "other than the general properties of distance , e.g. , non - negativity and triangle inequality , an additional property that the distance between any two equivalent points is zero has to be satisfied for the defined distance .",
    "next , we provide two common definitions .    _ definition 1 : _",
    "( projective - frobenius norm distance ) for any two points @xmath17 , the projective - frobenius norm distance between them is @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the canonical angles of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which are defined by the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "obviously , @xmath26 satisfy the inequality @xmath27 .",
    "_ definition 2 : _ ( projective-2 norm distance ) for any two points @xmath28 , the projective-2 norm distance between them is @xmath29 where @xmath30 , are the same as in definition 1",
    ". obviously @xmath26 satisfies inequality @xmath31 .",
    "based on the above definitions , if we know the canonical angles of any two points in @xmath13 , it is easy to calculate the distances between them .      in @xmath13 ,",
    "the hyperball @xmath32 with center @xmath33 and radius @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is one of the two defined distances in ( [ f4 ] ) and ( [ f5 ] ) .",
    "let the volumes of @xmath32 and @xmath14 be @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , then we define the normalized volume of hyperball @xmath39 as @xmath40 according to the haar measure theory of compact manifold [ 19 ] , this normalized volume defines the probability that the distance between any point and the center @xmath33 is no more than @xmath41 , i.e. ,    @xmath42    because of the unique right unitary transformation invariant measure [ 19 ] on @xmath14 , equation ( [ f8 ] ) implies that @xmath43 is exactly the probability of the distance between any two points which is no more than @xmath34 . as a result",
    ", we could calculate the normalized volume of hyperball by the probability @xmath44 .",
    "when @xmath45 , the probability density function of the canonical angles between any two points in @xmath13 are provided in reference [ 18 ] as @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "notice that @xmath50 are ordered with @xmath51 . according to ( 4 ) , two sets of different ordered angles correspond to two equivalent points in @xmath13 . with formula ( [ f9 ] ) , combining the distances defined in ( [ f3 ] ) and ( [ f5 ] ) , we write the volume of @xmath32 in @xmath52 as @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 . for the projective - f norm distance , the domain of integration is @xmath56 @xmath57 for the projective-2 norm distance , the domain of integration is @xmath58 @xmath59 next , we provide the results for various cases of @xmath15 and @xmath41 based on the two distances .",
    "when @xmath60 , a point in @xmath61 is a complex vector with unit norm in @xmath62 , then the canonical angle @xmath63 between two points is the usual euclidean angle of two vectors .",
    "both of the projective - f norm distance and projective-2 norm distance degenerate to the same as @xmath64 . substituting it into ( [ f9 ] ) results in @xmath65 hence ,",
    "the volume of @xmath66 in @xmath67 is integrated as @xmath68 @xmath69 moreover , as the correlation coefficient of two unit - norm vectors in @xmath70 is @xmath71 , the cdf of the correlation coefficient could be acquired from ( [ f14 ] ) as @xmath72 @xmath73      when @xmath75 , the distances defined in ( [ f3 ] ) and ( [ f5 ] ) are not the same anymore .",
    "we next calculate the normalized volume of the hyperball respectively .",
    "due to the fact that @xmath76 , combining ( [ f10 ] ) and ( [ f11 ] ) , the volume of hyperball @xmath77 in @xmath78 is @xmath79 @xmath80 where the integration is taken over @xmath81 @xmath82 since this is a complicated problem , and the result depends on the value of @xmath83 , we proide the result as a theorem below .",
    "the details are presented in appendix a.    the normalized volume of hyperball @xmath84 in complex grassmann manifold @xmath85 is    @xmath86    where @xmath87 @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xmath90 in ( [ f19 ] ) , @xmath91 is the beta difference function , where @xmath92 is the beta function defined as @xmath93 and @xmath94 denotes the incomplete beta function , which relates to the beta function as @xmath95 where @xmath96 in ( [ f20 ] ) , @xmath97 is the incomplete beta difference function .",
    "the constant @xmath98 in ( [ f18 ] ) is @xmath99      for the projective-2 norm distance , we have @xmath100 . combining ( [ f10 ] ) and ( [ f12 ] ) , the normalized volume of @xmath77 in @xmath78 is @xmath101 @xmath102 where the integration is taken over @xmath103 @xmath104 substituting the variables @xmath105 and @xmath106 , after derivation , the result becomes @xmath107 this means @xmath108 .      when @xmath109 , the situation becomes more complicated if we use the same method as @xmath75 , because it is very hard to determine the domain of integration as @xmath83 changes . before further analysis",
    ", we introduce the selberg beta integration and generalized selberg beta integration [ 20 ] as two lemmas which are the keys to solve the problem .    _ lemma 1 : _ ( selberg beta integration [ 20 ] )",
    "let the set @xmath110 be the integration domain , and the parameters @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 satisfy @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 respectively , then the selberg beta integration is @xmath117 @xmath118 the generalization of the above integration is the generalized selberg integration stated in lemma 2 .",

    "first , we consider the case of @xmath123 , then the volume of the ball @xmath124 in @xmath67 is written as @xmath125 @xmath126 the integration is taken over the domain in ( [ f11 ] ) .",
    "notice that the polynomial to be integrated is is symmetric and there are @xmath127 permutaions of @xmath128 , which means that ( [ f30 ] ) could be transferred to the following equivalent integration problem @xmath129 @xmath130 where the new domain @xmath131 is @xmath132 . substituting the variables @xmath133 , @xmath134 , with @xmath135 , ( [ f31 ] )",
    "is further transferred to @xmath136 @xmath137 where the integration is taken over @xmath138 .",
    "according to lemma 2 , we get the final formula for the case of @xmath139 as @xmath140 @xmath141 which is further simplified to @xmath142 for the case of @xmath143 , the domain of integration is a complicated polyhedron . in order to obtain the precise result",
    ", the integration domain has to be divided into @xmath144 sections and calculated in each section respectively .",
    "even so , it is still hard to get an analytic solution .",
    "fortunately , the requirement of the volume formula of hyperball @xmath145 for @xmath146 when @xmath147 and @xmath148 seldom occures , and if needed , the formula in reference [ 8 ] is accurate enough for practical applications .",
    "therefore , we cease to study this problem further in this paper .      according to the projective-2 norm distance , the volume of @xmath83-ball in @xmath67",
    "is calculated as the following integration @xmath149 @xmath150 where @xmath151 is defined in ( [ f12 ] ) .",
    "again , using the property of symmetric polynomial and substituting the variable @xmath133 with @xmath152 , @xmath134 , the above integration is transformed to @xmath153 @xmath154 where the integral is taken over @xmath155 . using lemma 1 and simplifying the results ,",
    "we get @xmath156 this means @xmath157 .      when @xmath158 , for any two points @xmath159 , let @xmath160,{{\\mathbf{v}}_2 } = \\left [ { \\begin{array}{*{20}{c } }    { { \\mathbf{v}}_2 ^ 1}&{{\\mathbf{v}}_2 ^ 2 }   \\end{array } } \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the first @xmath163 columns of @xmath164 and @xmath165 respectively , while @xmath166 and @xmath167 are the last @xmath168 columns of @xmath164 and @xmath165 respectively .",

    "using @xmath173 , we get @xmath174 = \\left [ { \\begin{array}{*{20}c }     { { \\mathbf{v}}_1^{1,h } { \\mathbf{v}}_2 ^ 1 } & { \\mathbf{0 } }   \\\\     { \\mathbf{0 } } & { \\mathbf{u } }   \\\\   \\end{array } } \\right].\\ ] ] let the svd of @xmath175 be @xmath176 , then @xmath177 could be expressed as @xmath178\\left [ { \\begin{array}{*{20}c }     { \\cos { \\mathbf{\\theta _ a } } } & { \\mathbf{0 } }   \\\\     { \\mathbf{0 } } & { \\cos { \\mathbf{0 } } }   \\\\",

    "according to the distance definitions , the volume of hyperball in @xmath183 is equal to that of @xmath182 . it also means @xmath184      in this section , we present some illustrative numerical results to show that the formulas provided in section iii yield very accurate results in various cases . in simulation , we generate @xmath185 couples of uniformly distributed points in @xmath183 , and calculate the projective - f norm distance and projective-2 norm distance of each couple of points . according to ( [ f8 ] ) , the cdf of these distance values denotes the probability @xmath186 . in order to generate",
    "uniformly distributed points in @xmath183 , a random matrix @xmath187 with @xmath188 elements is generated first .",
    "next , let the thin qr decomposition of @xmath189 be @xmath190 where the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath191 is positive ( e.g. , implemented by the gram - schmidt process ) , then the matrix @xmath192 is the desired matrix .",
    "here we provide a simple explanation of this method . for more details",
    "please refer to [ 21 ] .",
    "the ginibre ensemble @xmath193 consists of matrices @xmath194 , whose elements @xmath195 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "standard normal complex random variables .",
    "then , the probability density function of @xmath196 is @xmath197 .",
    "let the probability density function @xmath198 define a measure of @xmath193 as @xmath199 .",
    "given any @xmath200 , we define the equivalent class @xmath201 = \\left\\ { { \\left . { { \\mathbf{uqr } } } \\right|{\\mathbf{u } } \\in \\mathbb{u}\\left ( { n } \\right ) } \\right\\}$ ] . note that the set @xmath202 forms the stiefel manifold @xmath203 .",
    "since the measure @xmath204 is invariant under left - multiplication by @xmath205 , the restriction of @xmath206 to equivalent @xmath201 $ ] is also left - invariant for every @xmath207 . according to the harr measure theory , it means that the matrix @xmath208 is uniformly distributed on @xmath203 given any matrix @xmath207 .",
    "therefore , the method generates uniformly distributed points in grassmann manifold considering the equivalent relationship in stiefel manifold .",
    "the comparisons between the simulated and calculated results are shown in fig . 1 , fig .",
    "2 , fig . 3 , and fig . 4 for various cases .    in fig .",
    "1 , the cdf of correlation coefficient in @xmath209 is obtained by monte carlo simulation ( solid line ) and it is compared with the corresponding values ( circle ) from closed form ( [ f15 ] ) .",
    "obviously , we can say that the simulation results match the calculated results perfectly . for @xmath75 with projective - f norm distance , the simulated and calculated volume of hyperball with radius @xmath83",
    "are compared in fig .",
    "2 , while for @xmath210 and @xmath123 , similar comparisons are shown in fig .",
    "these two figures show the accuracy of ( [ f18 ] ) , ( [ f34 ] ) , and ( [ f41 ] ) . in fig .",
    "4 , the calculated values of formulas ( [ f37 ] ) and ( [ f41 ] ) are verified by simulation results for various @xmath11 and @xmath169 . again , they match each other almost perfectly .",
    "all the numerical results indicate that the closed - form formulas in this paper are accurate .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath211 is an exponential function of the dimension of complex vector space @xmath169 for given @xmath83 and @xmath11 , the volume of the hyperball with radius @xmath83 decreases very fast as @xmath169 grows , which means that the distance of any two @xmath11-dimensional subspaces in @xmath70 approaches to the maximum value rapidly as @xmath169 grows .",
    "in other words , the probability of any two @xmath11-dimensional subspaces being mutually orthogonal approaches to 1 very fast . this provdes a foundation for large - scale mu - mimo communication systems where the eigenspace of the wireless channel matrix is a point in @xmath183 .",
    "in this section , the formulas in section iv are applied to analyze the sinrs of mu - mmo with non - ideal csi in large - scale mimo systems .",
    "firstly , an error model of csi is constructed , then an approximation expression of sinr of each user is derived .",
    "after that , the expectation of sinr is obtained based on the probability density function of correlation coefficient between any two points in complex grassmann manifold .",
    "this expectation can be used to predict each user s data transmission rate in mu - mimo systems with non - ideal csi , and to predict the total data transmission rate in mu - mimo systems .",
    "finally , simulation results are provided to verify the validity of the approximation expression .",
    "considering a wireless communication system where a bs serves @xmath212 users .",
    "suppose that the bs has @xmath213 transmit antennas and each user has one receive antenna .",
    "in this system , the bs chooses the transmission mode adaptively according to the information of the @xmath212 users when transmitting data .",
    "the adaptive transmission mode includes switching between su - mimo and mu - mimo , and changing the the selection of users to serve in mu - mimo mode . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the bs only has cqi of each user in su - mimo mode as @xmath214 , which is the case in practical systems , e.g. , 3gpp lte / lte - a .",

    "because of system errors , e.g. , limited feedback bandwidth or measurement errors , the bs obtains the csi as @xmath220 instead of @xmath221 , and the relation between them could be modeled as @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the correlation coefficient between @xmath221 and @xmath220 defined as @xmath224 . since only the @xmath217th user is studied in this paper , the @xmath111 is used to replace @xmath225 for simplification .",
    "although @xmath226 satisfies the constraint @xmath227 , it should be much closer to 1 than to 0 so that the mu - mimo system can work in practice . in a tdd system , by making use of the channel reciprocity , the bs obtains the downlink csi through the pilot sent by users in the uplink , hence @xmath111 is mainly determined by the sinr of each user in the uplink , and it is different for each user .",
    "the symbol @xmath228 represents an unit vector in the null space of @xmath220 .",
    "obviously , @xmath221 , @xmath220 , and @xmath228 are elements in @xmath229 .",
    "at the bs side , the data of @xmath212 users transmitted on the same time - frequency resource in mu - mimo systems are mapped onto the @xmath213 antennas by the precoding matrix @xmath230 $ ] , where @xmath231 is the @xmath213-dimensional precoding vector belonging to the @xmath217th user .",
    "then , the sinr of the @xmath217th user with non - ideal csi could be written as @xmath232 where @xmath233 denotes the power of noise plus interference from neighboring cells .",
    "next , we analyze the sinr based on two general precoding methods : conjugate beamforming ( cb ) and zf .        for cb ,",
    "the precoding vector of the @xmath217th user is @xmath234 where @xmath235 is a scale factor which denotes the power allocated to the @xmath217th user . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the total transmit power is @xmath236 , and it is equally distributed among users .",
    "hence , @xmath237 , and @xmath238 .",
    "then , the sinr of the @xmath217th user is @xmath239 @xmath240 where @xmath241 . substituting ( [ f42 ] ) into ( [ f45 ] ) and making use of @xmath242",

    "actually , when the csi is ideal , the approximation ( [ f46 ] ) is equal to the accurate sinr .    when @xmath212 is large , the term @xmath248 is close to @xmath249 $ ]",

    "the values of @xmath258 and @xmath259 are closer and closer to 0 when @xmath213 increases , thus the std . of estimation error",
    "decreases correspondingly .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath111 is close to 1 , @xmath261 decreases rapidly when @xmath111 increases , hence as the accuracy of cqi estimation increases , the std . of estimation error decreases .",
    "for ( 49 ) , it is mostly affected by the value of @xmath212 according to its derivation process , hence increasing @xmath212 will decrease the estimation error of ( [ f49 ] ) .      in order to verify the validity of ( 46 ) , we provide some numerical results in fig . 5 and fig .",
    "6 , where the mean and std . of estimation errors are used to measure the accuracy of ( [ f46 ] ) . as @xmath111 is mainly determined by the uplink sinrs of users , we consider three typical sinr values of 0 , 3 , and 6 db , which correspond to the @xmath111 values of 0.7 , 0.8 , and 0.9 respectively according to ( [ f42 ] ) .",
    "if the uplink sinr of a user is less than 0 db , we consider it not suitable for mu - mimo . in fig .",
    "5 , we can see that the mean of estimation error is almost 0 regardless of the parameters @xmath213 , @xmath212 , and @xmath111 , which means that ( [ f46 ] ) provides an unbiased estimation of sinr .",
    "the std . of estimation error , which is affected by @xmath213 , @xmath212 , and @xmath111 ,",
    "is shown in fig .",

    "zf precoding is used to remove the multi - user interference completely , where the multi - user interference channel of the @xmath217th user is defined as @xmath262^t.\\ ] ] applying the null space projection , the precoding vector of the @xmath217th user could be written as @xmath263 although zf could remove the multi - user interference , it would reduce the sum of channel capacity if the grouped users for mu - mimo have high mutual channel correlation .",
    "therefore , the bs should group the users whose mutual correlation coefficients @xmath264 , are lower than a predefined threshold .",
    "since @xmath265 , @xmath266 approaches to @xmath267 when @xmath213 becomes large according to the conclusion in section iii .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to replace @xmath268 with @xmath269 to simplify the analysis in this paper , and ( [ f51 ] ) becomes @xmath270 without losing generality , considering the @xmath217th user , substituting ( [ f52 ] ) into ( [ f43 ] ) and after derivation , it becomes @xmath271 @xmath272 in order to simplify the denominator in ( [ f53 ] ) , we approximate it as @xmath273 when @xmath274 , the left side is strictly equal to the right side in ( [ f54 ] ) .",

    ", we get @xmath280 we get ( [ f56 ] ) at the top of the next page .",
    "@xmath281    since the above formula is still too complicated , we continue to simplify the numerator and denominator respectively by ignoring the secondary factors . for the numerator , as the probability of @xmath282 approaches to 1 when @xmath283 , the term @xmath284 can be dropped and the result becomes @xmath285 .",
    "similarly for the denominator , we reduce it to @xmath286 .",
    "in addition , we have @xmath287 .",
    "therefore , the sinr of @xmath217th user could be rewritten as @xmath288 with ( [ f57 ] ) , the bs can choose the suitable combination of modulation scheme and channel coding rate for each user in a mu - mimo user group .",
    "as a result , the bs can properly group mu - mimo users and adaptively switch between mu - mimo and su - mimo .    in some cases , the expectation of sinr provides a more reliable prediction of the mu - mimo spectral efficiency at a given error level of csi .",

    ", we provide some discussion about the approximations ( [ f57 ] ) and ( [ f59 ] ) . for ( [ f57 ] ) , there are three factors affecting its accuracy .",
    "firstly , given the values of @xmath212 and @xmath111 , the probability of @xmath306 increases as @xmath213 grows in ( [ f51 ] ) , hence the approximation error of the numerator in ( [ f56 ] ) is almost ignorable when @xmath213 is large , e.g. , @xmath307 .",
    "on the other hand , the values of @xmath308 and @xmath309 are closer and closer to zero as @xmath213 grows . as a result ,",
    "the approximations of the numerator and denominator in ( [ f56 ] ) are reasonable for large @xmath213 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the gap between the approximated value in ( [ f57 ] ) and the real sinr becomes smaller as @xmath213 grows .    secondly , given the values of @xmath213 and @xmath111 , the probability of @xmath306 decreases as @xmath212 grows , while the values of @xmath308 and @xmath309 show inverse tendency .",
    "this means that the approximation of @xmath310 in ( [ f51 ] ) and the omission of @xmath308 and @xmath309 in ( [ f56 ] ) would cause larger error as @xmath212 grows .",
    "thirdly , given the values of @xmath213 and @xmath212 , the value of @xmath311 decreases as @xmath111 increases .",
    "hence , ignoring this term causes little error in ( [ f56 ] ) for @xmath111 close to 1 .",
    "therefore , as the csi is more accurate , the approximation in ( [ f57 ] ) resluts in less error .    in conclusion , larger values of @xmath213 , @xmath111 , or smaller value of @xmath212 result in a more accurate approximation in ( [ f57 ] ) .",
    "as ( [ f59 ] ) provides a lower bound of expectation of sinr , we can analyze the factor which affects the gap between the lower bound and the real value .",
    "firstly , the term @xmath312 approaches to @xmath313 $ ] as @xmath212 grows , which means that for a large value of @xmath212 , the inequality in ( [ f59 ] ) approaches to equality . secondly , if @xmath312 is negligible relative to the value of @xmath314 , e.g. , @xmath213 or @xmath113 is very large , the inequality also approaches to equality . as a result , the lower bound of ( [ f59 ] ) is asymptotically tight as @xmath212 or @xmath213 grows .    with the approximation of sinr in ( [ f57 ] ) and",
    "@xmath315 $ ] in ( [ f59 ] ) , it is easy for the bs to predict the capacity of each user in mu - mimo mode , the sum capacity gain over su - mimo , and the total capacity of the grouped users .",
    "we present numerical simulation results in this section to verify the validity of ( [ f57 ] ) and ( [ f59 ] ) .",
    "similarly to the conjugate beamforming case , the mean and std . of the estimation error",
    "are used to measure the accuracy of ( [ f57 ] ) , and the results with different values of @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath111 are shown in fig . 8 and fig .",
    "9 respectively . for ( [ f59 ] ) , the estimation value and the real expectation of sinr",
    "are compared in fig .",
    "10 .    in fig",
    ". 8 , we can see that the mean of estimation error increases as the su - mimo sinr increases , which is because when the value of su - mimo sinr is small , the noise and inter - cell interference are the major factors affecting the mu - mimo sinr .",
    "as the value of su - mimo sinr increases , the residual multi - user interference becomes the major factor , and the estimation error of ( [ f57 ] ) becomes dominant .",
    "in addition , the mean of estimation error increases as the value of @xmath212 increases , and decrease as the value of @xmath213 or @xmath111 decreases , which verifies the analysis in 2 ) above .",
    "for the same reasons , fig .",
    "9 shows similar variation tendency to fig . 8 . considering that the number of grouped users is about 1/10 to 1/5 of the number of antennas in large - scale mu - mimo systems ( e.g. , @xmath316 , @xmath317 ) , ( [ f57 ] ) provides sinr estimation with relatively high accuracy .    in fig .",
    "10 , the difference between the estimation and real values is close to 0 for most cases , and it is about 1 db in the high sinr region .",
    "hence , it provides a reasonable estimation of the expectation of sinr .        in this section",
    ", we compare the sinrs of cb and zf in ( 44 ) and ( 59 ) .",
    "the sinr gain of zf over cb at a given csi error level is @xmath318 where @xmath291 is the same as in ( [ f58 ] ) which denotes the multi - user interference power among the users in mu - mimo . according to ( [ f60 ] ) , @xmath319 when",
    "@xmath212 is large , then ( [ f60 ] ) is reduced to a simple function of @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath111 as    @xmath320    here , we offer a discussion about ( [ f60 ] ) and ( [ f61 ] ) . in the high @xmath301 region , as @xmath321 and @xmath322 , we have @xmath323 , and @xmath324 \\to \\frac{{{n^2 } + \\left ( { k - 1 } \\right)\\left ( { k - 1 - 2n } \\right)}}{{{n^2}\\left ( { 1 - { \\alpha ^2 } } \\right)}}$ ] .",
    "therefore , the sinr gain of zf over cb increases from @xmath325 to positive infinity when @xmath111 varies from 0 to 1 .",
    "it indicates that zf has an overwhelming advantage compared to cb when the csi is ideal , which coincides with our conventional understanding .",
    "however , as the error of csi increases , the sinr gain of zf begins to decrease , and both zf and cb has the same sinr value when @xmath326 . if @xmath111 decreases further , the sinr of zf becomes smaller than that of cb .    in the low @xmath301 region , as @xmath327 , @xmath328 , and @xmath324 \\to \\frac{{n - k + 1}}{n}$ ] .",
    "it means that the sinr gain of zf over cb is definitely smaller than 1 , regardless of the considered parameters .",
    "given the value of @xmath111 , increasing the value of @xmath213 or decreasing the value of @xmath212 could result in smaller @xmath291 according to the definition of @xmath291 , thus enlarge the sinr gain of zf over cb .    in conclusion ,",
    "if the csi is not ideal , the sinr gain of zf over cb is determined by the parameter @xmath111 given the values of @xmath213 and @xmath212 in the high @xmath301 region , while the sinr gain of zf is always smaller than 1 in the low @xmath301 region and independent of @xmath111 .",
    "we provide some numerical results to verify the rationality of formula ( [ f60 ] ) and ( [ f61 ] ) in fig .",
    "12 , and fig . 13 . in fig .",
    "11 , the formulas ( [ f60 ] ) ( estimated gain ) and ( [ f61 ] ) ( asmp gain ) are compared with the real gain , where we can see that both the formulas ( [ f60 ] ) and ( [ f61 ] ) provide underestimation of the real gain . nevertheless , the estimation errors are relatively small , and these two formulas could be used to predict the gain of zf over cb for large - scale mu - mimo systems .",
    "the std . of ( [ f60 ] ) and ( [ f61 ] )",
    "are shown in fig .",

    "@xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath111 in fig .",
    "12 is similar to that of fig .",
    "13 shows a relatively different variation of std . , where the std .",

    "when the csi is ideal , the multi - user interference is removed completely when zf precoding is employed , then the sinr of the @xmath217th user for mu - mimo is @xmath329 where @xmath330 with the matrix @xmath331 defined as @xmath332^t $ ] .",

    "16 , the estimation matches the real value almost perfectly .",
