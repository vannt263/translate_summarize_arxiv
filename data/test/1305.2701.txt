    "soon after the discovery of the accelerating cosmic expansion from the observations of type ia supernova ( snia ) @xcite , a number of authors have investigated the anisotropies of the cosmic acceleration @xcite , which was motivated in several aspects : from the theoretical point of view , the anisotropy may arise in some cosmological models , such as the vector dark energy models @xcite , the anisotropic equation - of - state of dark energy@xcite , the non - trivial cosmic topology @xcite , the statistically anisotropic primordial perturbations @xcite or the existence of a large - scale primordial magnetic field @xcite . and also the study can be used to check the validity of the cosmological principle @xcite , to measure expected deviations from the isotropy due to various motions of local group @xcite , or to search for the possible systematic errors in observations and their analysis @xcite .",
    "in particular , several groups @xcite have applied the hemisphere comparison method to study the anisotropy of @xmath6cdm , @xmath7cdm and the dark energy model with cpl parametrization , where the supernova data and the corresponding cosmic accelerations on several pairs of opposite hemispheres have been used to search for maximally asymmetric pair , and a statistically significant preferred axis has been reported . as emphasized in @xcite ,",
    "although this method optimizes the statistics due to the large number of supernovae in each hemisphere , it has lost all information about the detailed structure of the anisotropy .    in this paper",
    ", we shall extend this issue to investigate the cosmic acceleration in different parts of the whole sky , and study the possible existence of anisotropy . to do it",
    ", we take use of the union2 dataset @xcite , and divide them into 12 parts according to their positions in galactic coordinate system . among them , six regions are useless and masked in the investigation due to the lack of supernova data . in each unmasked region , we study the cosmic acceleration by taking the deceleration parameter @xmath0 as the diagnostic , and find the significant difference for different regions .",
    "we extract the lowest multipole components , i.e. monopole and dipole , in this anisotropic map , and find that the monopole amplitude is @xmath8 , which is consistent with other observations , and shows the present acceleration of cosmic expansion .",
    "meanwhile , we find the significant dipole , and the amplitude is @xmath1 , which deviates from zero in more than 2-@xmath2 confident level .",
    "interesting enough , the direction of the best - fit dipole is at ( @xmath3 , @xmath4),,@xmath9 ) in the galactic system , which relates to the galactic coordinate ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) by @xmath12 and @xmath13 . ] which is nearly perpendicular to cmb kinematic dipole , and the angle between these two dipole directions is @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that the origin of the anisotropy of cosmic acceleration may connect with the cmb kinematic dipole .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a general introduction to the analysis method , and apply to @xmath7cdm model fitted by the union2 dataset . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the monopole and dipole components , especially the direction of dipole , and compare with cmb kinematic dipole .",
    "3 gives our conclusions .",
    "in this paper we take use of the union2 dataset @xcite , which contains 557 type ia snia data and uses salt2 for snia light - curve fitting , covering the redshift range @xmath14 $ ] and including samples from other surveys , such as cfa3 @xcite , sdss - ii supernova search @xcite and high - z hubble space telescope . the direction distribution of the supernovae in galactic coordinate system",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( left panel ) @xcite .    in order to investigate the cosmic acceleration in different directions , in principle",
    "we can divide the total supernovae into a number of groups according to their positions and redshifts .",
    "limited by the total number of the snia , in this paper we shall ignore the possible redshift effect of the anisotropy .",
    "healpix is a genuinely curvilinear partition of the 2-dimensional sphere into exactly equal area quadrilaterals of varying shape , which is advantageous since sky signals are sampled without regional dependence @xcite .",
    "the base - resolution comprises 12 pixels in three ring around the poles and equator .",
    "the resolution of the grid is expressed by the parameter nside . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the lowest resolution with nside=1 due to the fact that the total number of snia is not too large .",
    "the 12 regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( right panel ) .",
    "we find that the distribution of snia in the sky is not isotropic . in regions 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , i.e. galactic plane ,",
    "the numbers of snia are very smaller ( i.e. @xmath15 in region 5 , @xmath16 in region 6 , @xmath17 in region 7 , @xmath18 in region 11 ) .",
    "in addition , we also find that @xmath19 in region 1 , and @xmath20 in region 12 .",
    "so in the following discussion , we will not use these six regions , because of the small numbers of snia . in table",
    "[ table1 ] , we list the values of @xmath21 in the other six regions , which will be used for the analysis .",
    "[ table1 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in each region , we fit the snia data by minimizing the @xmath22 values of the distance modulus .",
    "the @xmath23 for snia is obtained by comparing theoretical distance modulus @xmath24+\\mu_0 $ ] , where @xmath25 is a nuisance parameter , with observed @xmath26 of supernovae : @xmath27 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2(z_i)}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expressions of @xmath28 and @xmath29 depend on the cosmological model . in this paper",
    "we consider the flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker universe and the @xmath7cdm model .",
    "so one has @xmath30 and @xmath31.\\ ] ]      similar to @xcite , we use the deceleration parameter @xmath0 as the diagnostic of the cosmic acceleration . in the @xmath7cdm model",
    ", the present value of @xmath0 can be expressed as @xmath37 which is a combination of the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath38 .",
    "the results of the cosmological parameters @xmath38 , @xmath7 and the corresponding @xmath0 in each region are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "interesting , we find the significant difference for the different regions , even if the error bars are considered .",
    "for example , the absolute values of @xmath0 are quite small in regions 10 and 11 , but fairly large in regions 2 , 4 , 9 .",
    "the similar difference also exists for the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath7 .",
    "these are the clear indications of the anisotropy of the cosmic acceleration .    as the first step to quantify the anisotropy",
    ", we use the best - fit @xmath0 values as the diagnostic , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( upper panel ) . in order to describe the 2-dimensional anisotropic map ,",
    "it is convenient to expand it over the spherical harmonics as follows : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the spherical harmonics , and @xmath41 are the corresponding multipole coefficients . in this paper , due to the low resolution of the anisotropic map , we only consider the lowest multipoles : monopole with @xmath42 and dipole with @xmath43 .",
    "we apply the routine provided in healpix package to subtract the monopole and dipole components from the partial healpix map @xcite .",
    "the fit is obtained by solving the linear system @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the set of valid , unmasked pixels , and @xmath47 is the input map . @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 are respectively the monopole and dipole templates .",
    "the output monopole and dipole are respectively , @xmath52    applying to the @xmath0-map in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( upper panel ) , we obtain the fit monopole @xmath53 , which is equivalent to the average decelerating parameter in the whole sky .",
    "this value clearly shows that the present universe is in an accelerating expansion stage , which is consistent with other results @xcite .",
    "however , if we subtract this fit monopole from the @xmath0-map , the residual is still significant , which has the similar amplitude with the monopole component ( see the middle panel in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) .",
    "this shows that the anisotropy of @xmath0-map is quite important , which is also the motivation of our discussion in this paper .",
    "the lowest anisotropic component is the dipole .",
    "the dipole is described by the amplitude @xmath54 and the direction ( @xmath55 , @xmath9 ) in galactic coordinate system . for the @xmath0-map",
    ", we get the fit dipole with the parameters ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) , which is plotted in left panel of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "we find that the amplitudes of dipole and monopole are the same order .",
    "if subtracted both monopole and dipole from the @xmath0-map , we find the residual becomes very small , which is clearly shown in the lower panel in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "this implies that the main anisotropic component in @xmath0-map is contributed by the dipole component .",
    "recently , a few puzzling large - scale cosmological observations have been reported to challenge the standard model , which includes the alignment of the low multipoles of cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies @xcite , the parity asymmetry of cmb power spectrum @xcite , the large - scale velocity flows @xcite and the large scale alignment in the qso optical polarization data @xcite .",
    "especially , it was noticed that these anomalies are all connected with the cmb kinematic dipole in some sense @xcite .",
    "even the preferred axis of cosmic acceleration detected in @xcite by using the hemisphere comparison method is also claimed to align with the cmb kinematic dipole .",
    "here , we shall also compare the direction of the derived dipole component with that of cmb kinematic dipole , which is ( @xmath59mk , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) @xcite ( see right panel in fig . [ figure3 ] ) .",
    "note that this dipole component was derived from the wmap data , and has been used by planck mission for the calibration @xcite .",
    "the angle between these two dipoles is @xmath62 .",
    "so we find that , instead of alignment , these two dipoles are nearly perpendicular with each other .",
    "actually , the maximum axis reported by antoniou and perivolaropoulos in @xcite is ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) . , @xmath65 ) .",
    "] and the angle between this direction and the cmb kinematic dipole direction is @xmath66 .",
    "the different between these two results may be caused by the different direction resolutions of the methods .",
    "+   +    now , let us discuss the monopole and dipole components in the general @xmath0-map , instead of those in the best - fit map . according to the @xmath0 likelihood functions in the unmasked regions , we generate @xmath67 random samples of @xmath68 , where @xmath69 stands for the @xmath0 in the @xmath70-th region .",
    "for each dataset , we derive the corresponding monopole and dipole , and calculate the 1-dimensional likelihood functions for @xmath71 and @xmath54 parameters , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] .",
    "we find that @xmath8 , which is smaller than zero in more than 5-@xmath2 confident level .",
    "so the present universe is in an accelerating stage .",
    "interesting enough , we also find that @xmath1 , i.e. the amplitude of dipole is non - zero at more than 2-@xmath2 level .",
    "so again , we find that the dipole effect is quite significant .    in order to study the direction of the dipole component , in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] we plot the likelihood distribution in 2-dimensional space ( left panel ) , and the corresponding best - fit value is ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "it is very interesting to find that the angle between this best - fit dipole and cmb kinematic dipole is @xmath72 .",
    "again , we find that these two dipoles are nearly perpendicular with each other . in the right panel",
    ", we plot 1-@xmath2 with yellow region and 2-@xmath2 with cyan region .",
    "for comparison with cmb kinematic dipole , in this figure we also plot the region with black line , which is exactly perpendicular to cmb kinematic dipole .",
    "we find this black line excellently crosses the centers of 1-@xmath2 and 2-@xmath2 regions , which is consistent with the above results .",
    "the 1-dimensional likelihood functions for @xmath55 and @xmath9 are also shown in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , which correspond to the constraints of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    in order to quantify the perpendicular relation between these two dipole directions @xmath75 ( the best - fit dipole of cosmic acceleration ) and @xmath76 ( cmb kinematic dipole ) , similar to @xcite",
    ", we can define the dot product @xmath77 . under the null hypothesis that these two dipoles are statistically independent , with the unit vectors @xmath75 and",
    "@xmath76 being independently drawn from a distribution where all directions are equally likely .",
    "this means that the dot product @xmath78 is a uniformly distributed random variable on the interval @xmath79 $ ] . by using the values of @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    ", we get @xmath80 , corresponding to a separation of @xmath5 .",
    "so a perpendicular this good happens by chance only once in @xmath81 .    in the end of this section , although we will not detailedly study the physical mechanism of the perpendicular relation in this paper , we could provide some possible reasons for this coincidence problem .",
    "similar to other puzzles in the large - scale observations @xcite ( see @xcite as a review ) , these anomalies may be the indications of the non - trivial cosmic topology , such as the bianchi type models @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , as mentioned by some authors @xcite , these coincidences may also hint some unsolved systematical errors in observations or data analysis .",
    "recently , the anisotropy of cosmic acceleration has attracted great attention , which may be caused by the non - trivial cosmic topology or some residuals of observational errors . in this paper , by using the union2 snia dataset at different regions in the whole sky , we investigated the dependence of cosmic acceleration on the directions in the galactic coordinate system , where the deceleration parameter @xmath0 has been used as the diagnostic to quantify the anisotropy level .    in the anisotropic @xmath0-maps , we find the significant dipole effect with the amplitude @xmath1 , which deviates from zero at more than 2-@xmath2 level .",
    "this study also shows that the direction of the dipole trends to be perpendicular to cmb kinematic dipole . the best - fit dipole direction is ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , and the angle between this direction and that of cmb kinematic dipole is @xmath5 .",
    "we find the perpendicular relation between these two dipoles is anomalous at the 1-in-10 level .",
    "it is important to mention that as more and more supernovae data will be released in the near future @xcite , the much more details of the anisotropy on cosmic acceleration could be revealed ( including the higher multipoles with @xmath82 and the dependence of redshift ) , which would be helpful to resolve the origin of anisotropy on cosmic acceleration , and the association with cmb kinematic dipole .",
    "recently , the new release of the planck observations on the cmb temperature anisotropy confirmed the alignment of the cmb quadrupole and octupole . and",
    "this particular direction is nearly aligned with cmb kinematic dipole direction @xcite . at the same time , the discontinuous distribution of power in the hemispheres on the sky was also been confirmed .",
    "all these show that we have the evidence for a break in isotropy . in order to solve these problems ,",
    "a phenomenological dipole modulation may be needed @xcite . since all these directional anomalies , as well as the alignment problems of the cosmic acceleration anisotropy discussed in this paper , the parity asymmetry of cmb power spectrum @xcite , the large - scale velocity flows @xcite and the large scale alignment in the qso optical polarization data @xcite are connected with the cmb kinematic dipole and/or the ecliptic plane .",
    "we expect a single dipole modulation mechanism could solve all these puzzles .",
    "several works have suggested that this kind of modulation could be caused by the non - trivial topology of the universe , such as the anisotropic global bianchi viih geometry @xcite , the randers - finsler geometry @xcite , or the multi - stream inflation @xcite . however ,",
    "if they have the cosmological origin , it is very difficult to answer : why the special direction is related to the current motion direction of the earth , i.e. the cmb kinematic dipole .",
    "so , in our view , we would rather believe that these problems should be caused by some unsolved systematical errors in observations or data analysis . in any case , the much more detailed investigations on this kind of directional anomalies are necessary .",
