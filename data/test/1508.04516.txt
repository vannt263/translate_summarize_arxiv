    "the relaxation dynamics of supercooled liquids occurs through local particle rearrangements whose energy cost is related to the elastic properties of the material .",
    "this suggests the existence of correlations between the elasticity and the dynamics of supercooled liquids .",
    "indeed , at the local scale particle mobilities have been found to be related to local elastic constants  @xcite . at the macroscopic level",
    "these correlations have stimulated the formulation of elastic models of the glass transition , which relate the relaxation dynamics and the elasticity of glass formers .",
    "for instance , according to dyre s shoving model  @xcite , the relaxation occurs through local volume - preserving events that allow the system to transit from one potential energy minimum to a different one .",
    "if one estimates the energy barrier separating two energy minima within a parabolic approximation , this approach leads to the relation @xmath0 between the relaxation time and the plateau shear modulus , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an atomic volume element that is assumed to be temperature independent , @xmath3 is temperature and @xmath4 is boltzmann s constant .",

    "@xcite for a discussion regarding the interpretation of @xmath1 .",
    "recent numerical results on polymer melts  @xcite and on systems of particles interacting via inverse power law potentials  @xcite , showed the possibility of connecting the plateau shear modulus to features of the energy landscape of the system  @xcite . indeed , these studies found @xmath1 to be related to the fluctuations of the inherent shear stress , @xmath5 . here @xmath6 is the shear stress measured after quenching a system to its inherent structure , i.e.  the nearest potential energy minimum",
    "together , dyre s shoving model and the results of refs .",
    "@xcite lead to a relation between the relaxation time on the one hand , and features of the inherent energy landscape on the other .",
    "a related approach to connecting the dynamics to elastic properties via features of the energy landscape can be motivated by an analogy with the lindemann melting criterion for periodic crystal structures . here a relaxation event is considered to occur through local rearrangements that take place when the mean squared vibrational amplitude of a particle @xmath7 , which is its debye  waller ( dw ) factor , crosses some threshold @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is of the order of the particle size .",
    "if this process requires an energy barrier @xmath10 to be overcome , one recovers the hall ",
    "wolynes equation @xmath11 this connects the structural relaxation time to a short  time elastic property , the dw factor .",
    "this approach has recently been  @xcite generalized by introducing a probability distribution for @xmath8 , and successfully tested against experimental and numerical data , including both strong and fragile glass  formers .",
    "the main message from this work is that there is a one  to ",
    "one correspondence between the relaxation dynamics and the dw factor .",
    "these two approaches for understanding glassy relaxation times that we have described above are close related to each other because the dw factor is fixed mainly by the shear modulus of the material  @xcite",
    ". we will therefore refer to them collectively as `` elastic models '' .",
    "in this paper we consider the applicability of elastic models to suspensions of particles interacting via a harmonic potential .",
    "similar finite range purely repulsive potentials are of interest as model for the interaction of macroscopic particles such as bubbles , foams and microgels , whose dynamics exhibit glassy features at high concentration and/or low temperature . in addition , these potentials are also of interest for being able to give rise to water  like density anomalies at high densities  @xcite , in spite of their manifest simplicity .",
    "the possible applicability of elastic models to these systems is of particular interest because elastic models are based on an energy landscape interpretation of the dynamics , while density anomalies have been rationalized by entropic arguments  @xcite .",
    "we will show that in finite range repulsive systems the shear modulus estimated from the properties of the underlying energy landscape overestimates the plateau shear modulus , which implies that the energy landscape properties are poorly correlated with the elasticity .",
    "nevertheless , we do find correlations between relaxation time , diffusivity , plateau shear modulus and dw factor that are consistent with those predicted by the elastic model of the glass transition .",
    "our results indicates that while elastic models correctly describe the relaxation dynamics of the system , their interpretation in terms of features of the energy landscape should be reconsidered .",

    "the local curvature of these minima , which is related to the shear modulus of the system , sets the energy scale of these events and thus controls the relaxation dynamics .",
    "this energy ",
    "landscape interpretation makes it of interest to investigate the relation between the elastic properties measured in the liquid phase , and those observed after quenching the system to its inherent structure .",

    "we find that also in our system , @xmath51 decreases on cooling .",
    "however , as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : gvst ] , significant differences appear in the behaviour of the inherent structure stresses , and the relative size of the instantaneous and inherent structure stresses .",
    "we note first that @xmath52 depends on the temperature of the parent liquid .",
    "this behaviour signals the fact that the system explores different regions of the energy landscape at different temperatures . in similar systems , this feature has recently been exploited to prove that the volume fraction at which the inherent structure shear stress vanishes , the jamming volume fraction , depends on the temperature of the parent liquid  @xcite .",
    "this proves that the jamming volume fraction is protocol dependent  @xcite . at high temperatures the dynamics of the system",
    "is no longer affected by the energy landscape , and @xmath52 should be temperature independent .",
    "[ fig : gvst ] suggests that we have reached this high temperature regime for @xmath40 .",

    "fig : gvst ] ) that @xmath53 , while the opposite relation is found in inverse  power law liquids .",
    "we can make sense of this result by considering that the fluctuations of the shear stress are related to the instantaneous shear modulus . for harmonic potentials ,",
    "whose second ( radial ) derivative of the potential is constant , the instantaneous shear modulus is expected to scale with the density of contacts , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the average contact number per particle .",
    "[ fig : zt ] shows the temperature dependence of @xmath55 for the parent liquid , where @xmath55 increases on cooling , and for the inherent structures , where @xmath56 is constant .",
    "at all temperatures , the average contact number of the inherent structures is larger than the average contact number of the parent liquid .",
    "this implies that the inherent shear modulus @xmath57 , is larger than the shear shear modulus of the parent liquid , @xmath58 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath59 , which is the relation we saw in fig .",
    "[ fig : gvst ] . in power law potential systems the situation is different :",
    "the single particle bulk modulus , which is directly related to the second derivative of the potential , is not constant but increases without bound as the interparticle distance becomes smaller .",

    "we now consider whereas the slowdown of the dynamics is well described by elastic models of the glass transition .",
    "first we consider dyre s shoving model , according to which @xmath61 , where as before @xmath1 is the plateau shear modulus , and @xmath2 a local activation volume . as usual we assume that the latter does not change with temperature , but now add the assumption that it is also independent of volume fraction .",
    "[ fig : gt ] shows the relaxation dynamics of the instantaneous shear stress : the transient shear modulus @xmath62 exhibits the two  step decay typical of glasses . from @xmath62 , we can estimate a plateau modulus @xmath1 in the deeply supercooled regime as the value of @xmath62 at the ( intermediate ) time at which the derivative of @xmath62 with respect to @xmath63 is minimal .",

    "[ fig : taug ] .",
    "here we show ( black circles ) that the relaxation time is correlated fairly tightly with the plateau shear modulus @xmath1 in particular , the expected exponential relation between relaxation time and plateau modulus divided by @xmath67 is observed in the deeply supercooled regime .",
    "it is important to note here that the figure combines points taken at different temperatures and volume fractions .",
    "in particular , the filled black circles refer to @xmath68 and volume fractions around the one giving the minimal diffusivity .",
    "this proves that elasticity as measured by the plateau shear modulus is well correlated with the dynamics in the anomalous region .",
    "while the prediction of the shoving model appears to be reasonably well verified , its interpretation in terms of the features of the energy landscape of the system is not .",
    "indeed , in this interpretation the plateau shear modulus should be related to the inherent structure shear modulus , as recently found in power  law liquids  @xcite . in these systems @xmath69 and at all times @xmath70 intuitively , the instantaneous stress has larger fluctuations over short time scales than the inherent structure stress , but around the timescale of the plateau the fast fluctuations have averaged out and the relaxations of instantaneous and inherent structure stress track each other .    in our short range harmonic repulsive systems , on the other hand , we find @xmath71 as shown in fig .
