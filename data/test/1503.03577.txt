    "despite the fact that a glueball state has not been confirmed experimentally , its existence is an unavoidable and yet uncannily prediction of qcd .",
    "glueball states may have different lorentz structures in general , such as a scalar , a pseudoscalar or even a tensor with either normal or exotic @xmath11 assignment .",
    "the prediction for the glueball masses is , however , a difficult task .",
    "theoretical calculations indicate that the lowest lying glueball state is a scalar @xmath12 state with a mass in the range of 1.6 to 2 gev .",
    "previous quenched lattice qcd calculation gave such a glueball mass @xmath13 equals @xmath14 gev @xcite .",
    "recent result from unquenched lattice qcd calculation @xcite gives a result of @xmath15 gev for this state .",
    "these results support that the scalar meson @xmath3 to be a glueball .",
    "phenomenologically , @xmath3 could be an impure glueball since it may be contaminated by possible mixings with the colorless quark - antiquark states that have total isospin zero @xcite .",
    "these mixing effects can be either small @xcite or large @xcite , depend largely on the mixing schemes one chose to do the fits and these may complicate the analysis .",
    "quenched lattice calculation also showed that the lowest lying @xmath16 state for a pure pseudoscalar glueball may have a higher mass around @xmath17 gev @xcite .",
    "qcd sum - rule approach @xcite also predicted higher than 1.8 gev for pseudoscalar glueball mass .",
    "all these results do not favored the earlier speculation of the @xmath18 being a pseudoscalar glueball .",
    "@xmath18 is indeed a perfect candidate for a @xmath16 glueball since it is copiously produced from the radiative decay of @xmath19 and not seen in the @xmath20 mode .",
    "recently it has been shown that when mixing effects and related data for the transition matrix elements of anomalous axial - vector current between vacuum and the three states @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are taken into account , the physical pseudoscalar glueball can be as light as @xmath24 gev @xcite .",
    "clearly , a full unquenched lattice calculation with the fermion determinant included must be performed in order to settle this issue satisfactory .",
    "indeed , it has been argued some time ago @xcite that due to the dynamical fermion effects the full qcd prediction for the pseudoscalar glueball mass will be substantially departure from its quenched approximation .",
    "however , the mass for the lowest lying @xmath16 state is still missing in the latest unquenched lattice results @xcite .    understanding glueball dynamics is therefore important though very challenging . in this work we will study scalar or pseudoscalar glueball production from rare semi - inclusive @xmath10 meson decay .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to refocus the attention of experimentalists for undertaking the proposed searches . from the experimental findings we can learn a lot .",
    "the quantitative numerical predictions are bound to have significant theoretical uncertainties ; nevertheless experimental efforts will be useful .",

    "being a two - body decay type , the energy of @xmath158 is energetic , given by @xmath159 with @xmath160 mev and @xmath161 typically equals 1 gev or so . on the other hand",
    ", for the @xmath158 production induced by @xmath162 , the energy of @xmath158 is more spread out .",
    "one therefore expects with a suitable cut on the glueball energy the two - body contributions can be removed , leaving the softer @xmath158 production presumably coming from the mechanism we suggested in this paper to satisfy the relative branching ratios given in this section .    to implement the cut , recall that the energy of the glueball @xmath163 is related to the rescaled variable @xmath164 according to @xmath165 where @xmath166 . with @xmath167 , @xmath168 .",

    "<S> we study glueball @xmath0 production in gluonic penguin decay @xmath1 , using the next - to - leading order @xmath2 gluonic penguin interaction and effective couplings of a glueball to two perturbative gluons . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent decays of a scalar glueball are described by using techniques of effective chiral lagrangian to incorporate the interaction between a glueball and pseudoscalar mesons . mixing effects between the pure glueball with other mesons </S>",

    "<S> , we find that both the top and charm penguin to be important and obtain a sizable branching ratio for @xmath4 of order @xmath5 , where the effective coupling strength @xmath6 is estimated to be @xmath7 gev@xmath8 using experimental data for the branching ratio of @xmath9 based on chiral lagrangian estimate . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative perturbative qcd based estimation of @xmath6 is a factor of 20 larger , which would imply a much enhanced branching ratio . </S>",
    "<S> glueball production from this rare semi - inclusive @xmath10 decay can be probed at the lhcb and belle ii to narrow down the allowed parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> similar branching ratio is expected for the pseudoscalar glueball . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly comment on the case of vector and tensor glueballs . </S>"
