    "as it is prevalently known , single - photon sources are of utmost importance in optical quantum information processing as well as in quantum optics .",
    "while many optical quantum information processing schemes including linear optical quantum computing @xcite , long - distance quantum key distribution @xcite and communication @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , tests of quantum nonlocality @xcite or boson sampling processors @xcite assume the controlled availability of single photons , in the latter case it can be necessary for the creation of certain nonclassical states of light @xcite . in the last fifteen years",
    "extensive experimental efforts have been under progress aiming at producing efficient single - photon sources .",
    "deterministic sources can be realized using different kinds of single quantum emitter systems such as quantum dots @xcite , diamond color centers @xcite , single atoms @xcite , ions @xcite , and molecules @xcite and also using ensembles of cold atoms @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , each of these methods has certain issues to overcome @xcite , including collection efficiency and repetition rates , or the complexity of experimental setups .",
    "it seems that in most of the known such systems , the indistinguishability of the produced photons is not high enough for the majority of the practical applications .",
    "these problems stimulated the construction of heralded single - photon sources ( hsps ) based on correlated photon pair generation in nonlinear optical media including spontaneous four - wave mixing ( sfwm ) in optical fibers and spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) in bulk crystals and waveguides .",
    "the latter process has been proven to be the most flexible and widespread resource for experiments in quantum information processing because highly indistinguishable single photons in an almost ideal single mode with known polarization can be generated with spdc systems @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the probabilistic nature of the pair generation complicates the creation of a deterministic , that is , either on - demand or periodic single - photon source based on this system .",
    "though the timing can be easily ensured by pulsed pumping , there remains a finite probability of generating either more than one or no photon pairs during an expected heralding event .    in the literature",
    "there are two suggested ways for overcoming this problem and enhancing the single - photon probabilities without increasing the output noise : spatial multiplexing @xcite and time multiplexing @xcite . in an earlier version of time",
    "multiplexing the application of a fiber - photon storage loop or a very high finesse photon storage cavity have been proposed for proper timing @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite an actively time - multiplexed scheme with a multistage delay line was presented that can be realized on a silicon - on - insulator photonic integrated circuit .",
    "recently , combination of spatial and time multiplexing has also been proposed @xcite . thus far",
    "only spatial multiplexing has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we provide a detailed statistical description which is applicable to all known kinds of multiplexed sources , aiming at the maximization of single - photon probabilities under realistic experimental conditions taking into account the possible loss mechanisms .",
    "we analyze these multiplexed systems for various sets of loss parameters .",
    "moreover , we propose a novel bulk time - multiplexed scheme the performance of which can be the best considering state - of - art experimental technology , comparing to the other known schemes , according to the analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : overview ] we review the known multiplexed periodic single - photon sources . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nobuti ] a novel bulk time - multiplexed scheme is presented .",
    "section  [ sec : statdesc ] introduces the proposed statistical description which is applicable to all known kinds of multiplexed sources . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we use the proposed scheme to analyze various kinds of multiplexing schemes , namely an ideal multiplexing system , a spatial multiplexer , storage cavity based multiplexer , and the proposed bulk time multiplexing scheme . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we summarize our results .",
    "a spontaneous parametric down - conversion process generates photon pairs probabilistically . a strong continuous or pulsed laser field , the pump , enters a crystal with second order optical nonlinearity .",
    "the interaction with the crystal results in the conversion of some of the pump photons into simultaneously generated photons of lower frequency . while the frequencies are determined by the energy conservation ,",
    "the wave numbers , and thus the propagation direction of the generated photons is determined by the conservation of momentum , termed as phase matching condition in this context .",
    "altogether there are direction pairs in which there are photons arriving at random instants , but completely correlated in time : if there is a photon in one of the directions ( called the signal photon ) , it is sure that there is a corresponding one propagating to the idler direction ( the idler photon ) at the same time @xcite .",
    "obviously , spectral filtering has to be applied to select the highly correlated photon pairs in different spdc sources .    after the filtering the probability of generating @xmath0 signal / idler pairs within a measurement time interval @xmath1 can be described with thermal statistics . for weaker spectral filtering the statistics approaches the poissonian limit .",
    "due to this nature of the spdc process there is a finite probability of obtaining either no photons or multiple photon pairs at a time . as a consequence ,",
    "detecting an idler photon with a standard single - photon detector , which does not distinguish multi - photon events from single - photon events , heralds the presence of the signal photon / photons , thus yielding a heralded single - photon source far from ideal .",
    "a way of creating a deterministic periodic single - photon source from this probabilistic one is the spatial multiplexing of @xmath2 single spdc sources , i.e. , multiplexed units , pumped by a pulsed laser , into a single one . in such systems ,",
    "the input pump power @xmath3 of the whole multiplexed system is chosen high enough to ensure high probability of obtaining at least one photon pair , while the pump power @xmath4 of a single spdc source is low enough that the probability of generating more than one pair in a multiplexed unit can be neglected . obviously , the period of this multiplexed hsps is equal to the period of the pulsed laser .",
    "time multiplexing is another possible way of addressing this problem .",
    "time multiplexing schemes can be divided into storage cavity - based and cascade delay - based schemes .",
    "the common feature of these techniques is that in order to achieve a periodic source of period @xmath5 , we choose an observation time @xmath6 for which we expect the arrival of at least one signal - idler pair .",
    "we divide this observation time to smaller time windows of length @xmath1 .",
    "if the system is pumped by a pulsed laser , @xmath1 will be the pumping period , while for continuous pumping the detector of the idler photons is active for such periods .",
    "if an idler photon is detected at a given time window , its signal counterpart is delayed to such an extent that finally it leaves at the end of the time @xmath7 .",
    "thus these time windows are the counterparts of multiplexed units in such schemes .",

    "dashed lines represent electronic control lines . ]",
    "let us now consider the operation of spatially multiplexing schemes in more detail .",
    "the key ingredients of the scheme are the photon routers .",
    "these devices are electronically controlled .",
    "they have multiple input ports and a single output .",
    "the control signal determines which single input port is directed to the output , while the others are closed .",
    "consider now @xmath2 sources of photon pairs , preferably pumped by the same strong pulsed laser .",
    "as the probability of the generation of a signal - idler pair is low , it is likely that only one of the sources will emit a pair .",
    "the detection of the idler can show which of the sources provided the signal photon . if all the signal modes are fed into a router , then the router sends the generated photon into its single output port .",
    "thereby it is certain that we do have a signal photon , and it will be directed to the output . for the case when there were multiple signal - idler pairs generated in the same period , a priority logic should be implemented in the router control to prefer only one of the signal photons .",
    "of course the time required by the operation of the switching should be compensated with a properly designed delay line in the signal port . in this way",
    "a router can merge multiple spdc sources into a single one .",
    "for we intend to study practical issues of such a scheme such as loss and efficiency , we have to take into account that the prevalently available routers have only two input ports .",
    "thus a single router is capable of merging two spdc sources into a single , more efficient source .",
    "this leads us to the cascaded scheme depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ter : model ] , which is implemented in the known experiments .",
    "here we have pairs of spdc sources ( all pumped by the same laser ) merged at the first level . at the next level",
    "the outputs of the pairs are arranged into pairs , and the detector signal is also forwarded to control the routers of the next level .",
    "thus the pairs of the first level are merged pairwise .",
    "finally there will be a single output only .",
    "of course the already mentioned priority logics as well as the delays should be designed appropriately . using the notation of fig .",
    "[ fig : ter : model ] , such a system needs @xmath10 input photon pairs and , accordingly , @xmath2 detectors and @xmath11 photon routers .",

    "@xmath7 the logic controls the second switch , os@xmath13 to release the photon , thereby ensuring the appropriate release time of the photon .",
    "if the photon was detected in the @xmath0-th time window of length @xmath1 within the period of @xmath15 , the storage cavity introduces a delay of length @xmath17 .",

    "note that when we decrease any of the three parameters @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath53 , the achievable single - photon probability will decrease .",
    "we remark that for bigger losses ( not shown ) the behavior of the function @xmath100 will be similar to what we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tgy : p1lpn ] for storage cavity based schemes , but the local maxima will appear only for certain combinations of the transmission coefficients .",
    "in fact the decrease of the mean photon pair number per time window can only compensate for @xmath53 .",
    "the single - photon probability @xmath64 as a function of @xmath65 for different combinations of loss parameters , considering a system of @xmath66 time windows , that is , of @xmath99 delay units for the proposed bulk time multiplexer , assuming ideal detectors and no generic losses ( @xmath79 ) . from top",

    "the legend of the symbols is in tab .  [",
    "tab : ido ] . ]     the achievable maximal single - photon probability @xmath64 at the optimal choice @xmath80 of the mean photon pair number as a function of the number of time windows @xmath2 on semi - logarithmic scale for various loss coefficients for the proposed bulk time multiplexer , assuming ideal detectors and no generic losses ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the legend of the symbols is in tab .  [",
    "tab : ido ] . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ido : lamn ] we present the optimal choice @xmath69 of the mean photon pair number as a function of the number of time windows @xmath2 on semi - logarithmic scale for various loss coefficients presented in tab .",
    "[ tab : ido ] . from the curves corresponding to the parameter sets no .  1 - 2 and 3 - 4 - 5 in tab",
    ".  [ tab : ido ] one can conclude that increasing the losses proportional to the length of the delay branches ( @xmath101 ) while keeping the coefficients @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( arising from the use or the omission of a delay unit , respectively ) constant , the optimal mean photon pair number @xmath69 required for the maximal single - photon probability decreases with the number of time windows .",
    "the explanation is similar to the reasoning given in the previous subsection for the other time multiplexing scheme : the decreased mean photon pair number leads to photons generated closer to the end of the observation time @xmath7 , thereby decreasing the necessary delay time and the probability of losing the photon in the medium of the delay system . from curves 4 .",
    "we can learn that if @xmath53 and @xmath55 are fixed , ( in particular , @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) then for @xmath104 ( that is , if the loss arising from the use of a delay branch is higher than that of its avoiding ) the optimal mean photon pair number required for the maximal single - photon probability decreases , while for @xmath105 it increases with the number of time windows .",
    "this can be expected as the number of activated branches increases with the increase of @xmath22 resulting in smaller losses for @xmath104 . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath105",
    "the decrease of the mean photon pair number decreases the number of activated branches leading to smaller losses .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ido : p1n ] we have plotted the maximal single - photon probability @xmath64 as a function of the number of time windows , for various loss coefficients .",
    "it appears that if there are only propagation losses ( @xmath106 ) in the system ( curves 1 - 2 ) , the function shows an increasing behavior asymptotically , while if there are delay unit losses ( @xmath107 ) , these curves also have a maximum .",
    "of course if @xmath106 , there is no disadvantage whatsoever in increasing the number of delay units and at the same time the number of time windows , while accompanying decrease of the size of the time windows the multiphoton probability decreases , which is an advantage . upon the presence of delay unit losses ( @xmath107 ) , however , the increase of the number of branches shall increase the zero - photon probability at the output which is the competing disadvantage .    in tab .",
    "[ tab : ido ] we have listed the achievable maximal single - photon probabilities @xmath73 along with the required number of @xmath108 delay branches , determined from the maxima of the curves of fig .  [ fig : ido : p1n ] .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath109 are also listed .",
    "we have also calculated how these parameters are modified if we have real photodetectors , e.g.  photomultipliers in the arrangements with a quantum efficiency of @xmath110 , corresponding to @xmath111 .",
    "it appears that the achievable maximal single - photon probabilities @xmath73 do not decrease significantly , only the required mean photon pair number and the number of branches changes in this case .",
    "we calculated @xmath73 for the best parameters available in the state - of - art experiment ( no .  4 in tab .  [ tab : ido ] ) and for an effective detector such as an avalanche diode ( @xmath112 ) , and obtained 85.4% at @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "this single - photon probability is the best that seems to be experimentally realizable nowadays in the analyzed multiplexed periodic single - photon sources .",
    "we gave an overview of the multiplexed periodic single - photon sources studied in the literature .",
    "we have suggested a novel time - multiplexed scheme in bulk optics .",
    "thus far only spatial multiplexing has been demonstrated experimentally , however , as these schemes require a relatively large number of components , their scalable realization is more feasible in integrated optics .",
    "if done so , a variety of problems arise , those related to coupling the input and output fields to the systems , for instance , which are not present in the case of bulk optics .",
    "our proposal is the first one for time multiplexing in bulk optics up to our knowledge , and all its elements are available in current experiments .",
    "we have introduced a theoretical framework for the statistical description of all the studied schemes , including the spatial and time multiplexing ones .",
    "we have taken into account all the losses which may arise in the schemes .",
    "the application of this analysis shows that multiplexing systems can be optimized in order to produce maximal single - photon probability for various sets of loss parameters by the appropriate choice of the number of multiplexed units of spatial multiplexers or multiplexed time intervals and the input mean photon pair number , and reveals the physical reasons of the existence of the optimum .",
    "we have performed this optimization for the studied schemes .",
    "this may be of use for the optimal design of a spatial or time multiplexer of this kind .",
    "the analysis shows that a promising single - photon probability of 85%  is feasible with the time - multiplexed scheme in bulk optics we have proposed",
    ".    the presented study can serve as a good basis for a design and realization of an spdc - based periodic single - photon source , which would be a necessary device for performing many optical quantum information processing tasks as well as fundamental quantum optical experiments .",
