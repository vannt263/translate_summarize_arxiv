    "graphene , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb structure of carbon atoms , has attracted a lot of interest since its isolation in 2004@xcite .",
    "it demonstrates unique properties which originate from the dirac - type spectrum of low - energy quasiparticles .",
    "nowadays , graphene is considered to be a viable alternative to si for the channel of field - effect transistors ( fets)@xcite .",
    "one of the main characteristics of such devices is a capacitance formed between the channel and the gate .",
    "the capacitance is important for understanding fundamental electronic properties of the material such as the density of states ( dos ) as well as device performance including the @xmath1 characteristics and the device operation frequency .    in a classical regime ,",
    "the capacitance describes the capability of an object to store electrical charges and is completely determined by the object s geometry and a dielectric constant of the medium .",
    "if the object s size shrinks to a nanometer scale , quantum effects have to be taken in account .",
    "one of manifestations of these effects is a finite dos which originates from the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "low - dimensional systems , having a small dos , are not able to accumulate enough charge to completely screen the external field . in order to describe the effect of the electric field penetration through a two - dimensional electronic gas ( 2deg ) luryi introduced a concept of a quantum capacitance@xcite .",
    "recently , the quantum capacitance of a bulk graphene layer deposited on a gated sio@xmath2 insulated surface has been investigated by means of scanning probe microscopy@xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no studies of the gate capacitance of the graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) have been reported yet",
    ". however , such studies are already technologically feasible .",
    "indeed , during last years the great progress has been achieved in fabrication and patterning of the gnrs@xcite as well as in controlling the morphology , geometry and stability of the graphene edges@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum and classical capacitance of related structures , - carbone nanotubes , has been measured and analyzed by a number of groups during the last years@xcite .",
    "the later studies have revealed a number of interesting properties of the system at hand including the structure of the dos and signatures of the electron interaction and correlation .    in order to provide physical insight into the gate electrostatics and capacitance of the gnrs , it is important to develop intuitive analytical models capturing the essential physics of the device at hand .",
    "such models are also imperative in experimental measurements because the quantum capacitance is not directly accessible in the experiments and can only be indirectly extracted from the measured total capacitance . in the present paper",
    "we develop a basic analytical theory for the gate electrostatics and the classical and quantum capacitance of the gnrs .",
    "we complement this analytical theory by exact self - consistent numerical calculations based on the tight - binding @xmath0-orbital hamiltonian within the hartree approximation .",
    "we demonstrate that the analytical theory is in a good qualitative ( and in some aspects quantitative ) agreement with the exact calculations .",
    "there are however some important discrepancies . in order to understand the origin of these discrepancies we investigate the self - consistent electronic structure and charge density distribution in the nanoribbons and relate the above discrepancy to the inability of the simple electrostatic model to capture the classical gate electrostatics of the gnrs . in turn , the failure of the classical electrostatics is traced to the quantum mechanical effects leading to the significant modification of the self - consistent charge distribution in comparison to the non - interacting electron description .",
    "it should be noted that particular aspects of the self - consistent gate electrostatics and the electron structure of the gnrs@xcite and the numerical@xcite and analytical@xcite studies of quantum capacitance of the gnrs have been reported in the literature . in particular ,",

    "in experiments graphene samples are separated from the gate by a relatively thick insulating substrate ( of a typical width of at least @xmath7 nm ) in order to enable visual identification of the graphene sheet . this simplest experimental setup ( with a single back gate )",
    "is not particularly suitable for measurements of the quantum capacitance because in this case ( as we will demonstrate below ) the total capacitance is completely dominated by the classical contribution and can hardly be extracted from the measured total capacitance . in order to distinguish the quantum contribution the gate should be placed much closer to the ribbon such that the classical capacitance @xmath8 becomes comparable to the quantum one . in our study",

    "however we assume that the back gate is situated much further apart from the ribbon in comparison to the top gate , and therefore for the sake of simplicity we in our model disregard a possible capacitative coupling between the ribbon and the back gate .    in this paper we considered two representative structures , ( i ) hfo@xmath2 insulating layer with @xmath16 nm and @xmath17 park , ozyilmaz , fernandez - rossier , and ( ii ) sio@xmath2 insulating layer with @xmath18 nm and @xmath19 .",

    "this is simply related to the fact that due to the series addition of the capacitances , for the case of @xmath141 the total capacitance is completely dominated by the classical one , and the features in @xmath4 can be reproduced only when @xmath142 becomes comparable to @xmath131 it is interesting to note that the difference between the experimentally extracted quantum capacitance and its expected value was detected for the case of the carbone nanotubes and was attributed to the strong electron correlation and signatures of the luttinger liquid behaviour@xcite .",
    "our calculations indicate that the origin of such deviations can have a rather simple explanation related to the inability of a standard electrostatics to reproduce quantitatively the classical capacitance of the structure at hand .",

    "there are however some important discrepancies . in order to understand the origin of these discrepancies we investigate the self - consistent electronic structure and the charge density distribution in the gnrs obtained from the exact numerical calculations .",
    "we demonstrate that the assumptions appropriate for a classical capacitor ( the charge density is homogeneous and the potential of the conductor is constant ) are violated for the graphene nanoribbons which leads to the difference between the analytical theory and the numerical calculations . in turn , the failure of the classical electrostatics is traced to the quantum mechanical effects leading to the significant modification of the self - consistent charge distribution in comparison to the non - interacting electron pictures .",
    "we also show that as a result of electron - electron interaction the band structure of the gnrs modifies as the applied gate voltage increases .",
    "our exact numerical calculations show that the density distribution and the potential profile in the gnrs are qualitatively different from those in conventional split - gate quantum wires with a smooth electrostatic confinement where the potential is rather flat and the electron density is constant throughout the wire . at the same time , the electron distribution and the potential profile in the gnr are very similar to those in the cleaved - edge overgrown quantum wires ( ceoqw ) exhibiting triangular - shaped quantum wells in the vicinity of the wire boundaries accompanied by the corresponding enhancement of the electron density close to the edges .",
    "this similarity reflects the fact that both the ceoqws and the gnrs correspond to the case of the hard - wall confinement at the edges of the structure .",
    "finally , we discuss experimental determination of the quantum capacitance @xmath135 we demonstrate that the extracted @xmath4 might significantly deviate from its actual value given by the density of states of the gnrs .",
