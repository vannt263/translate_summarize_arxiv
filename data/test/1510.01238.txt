    "given the diversity of mass and length scales , redshifts , initial conditions and physical processes that take part in the hierarchical formation of galaxies , the fact that most galaxies exhibit some common key properties , such as an exponential disk profile e.g. @xcite , and follow common scaling relations such as star formation rate - stellar mass relation ( e.g. @xcite ) is remarkable .",
    "such simple relations may imply that despite the diversity of initial and end states , there is a  subset \" of universal processes that effectively dominate these relations .",
    "even though many constituents are necessary to model correctly galaxy formation to its last detail , a toy model that involves as few parameters and processes as possible , and can nevertheless yield those key properties , is powerful in its ability to offer intuition towards their understanding .",
    "this approach has motivated the _ ` equilibrium - model ' _ ( or ` bathtub - model ' ) @xcite that has been used to investigate the content of galaxies , both gaseous and stellar , the associated star formation rate ( sfr ) , metallicities , and the relations between them , especially for the ( blue )  main sequence \" of galaxies .",
    "these models typically assume an equilibrium relation ( see for example @xcite ) , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the sfr , @xmath11 is the gas mass of the disk and @xmath12 is the gas - to - star depletion time ( or  turn - over \" time , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the outflowing baryonic mass out of the galaxy , back to the circum- or intergalactic medium ( cgm / igm ) in these models is proportional to the sfr , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mass - loading factor , set by energy and momentum injection back into the interstellar medium ( ism ) .    to date ,",
    "all of the equilibrium models have been applied to galaxies as a whole , ignoring the internal disk structures .",
    "in contrast , in this paper we formulate a radially resolved model , in which the equilibrium relations are  local \" and functions of ( planar ) distance from the disk centres , and assuming that the gas dynamics is set by the mass - continuity equation and global angular momentum conservation .",
    "our model is self - consistent , as star formation , disk rotation , outflows and the disk size are all set dynamically with the disk evolution .",
    "we study in detail how systems that follow these simple assumptions evolve , reach a ( quasi-)steady state , accumulate stellar mass , and analyze dynamically their surface density and toomre-@xmath15 profiles . in our presentation , we show that many of our numerical results can be derived analytically , by solving simplified cases of the full ( partial differential ) equations , for our single phase ism .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : setup ] we write the evolution equations and the assumptions of our model , and discuss a dimensionless representation for it . in ",
    "[ sec : cossnap ] we consider a cosmological snapshot  in which we hold the cosmological conditions constant , and analyze the consequent steady state and the convergence to it .",
    "next , in ",
    "[ sec : cosevol ] we generalise the cosmological snapshot , by accounting for the evolution of the halos , and varying baryon accretion rates . in  [ sec : results ] we analyze the results of our model for the cosmologically evolving system , and present a parameter study .",
    "we summarise in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we consider an evolving , rotationally supported , star forming disk , within a cosmologically growing dm halo .",
    "the halo accretes baryonic matter from its cosmological neighbourhood , at some given rate @xmath16 , forms stars continuously , and expels matter back to the cgm / igm at a rate proportional to the star formation rate .",
    "our radially resolved equilibrium model is based on the dynamics set by mass - continuity and angular momentum conservation , together with local equilibrium relations .",
    "the mass continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates ( assuming cylindrical symmetry ) includes cosmological accretion , and star formation and outflows as source and sink terms , and follows the gas surface density in the disk , @xmath17 .",
    "it can therefore be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the ",
    "local \" sfr and outflow rates respectively , @xmath21 is the radial gas velocity within the disk ( inflow velocity is @xmath22 ) , and where for the second equality we have assumed ` local ' equilibrium relations , @xmath23 to solve the mass - continuity equation , we will have to specify the boundary condition at some outer radius @xmath24 , and the gas radial inflow velocity @xmath25 at each radius .",
    "we do that as follows :    * we assume that the entire ( thin ) baryonic disk , gas+stars , is confined to a radius @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 .",
    "we determine @xmath26 by setting the specific angular momentum of the accreted gas onto the disk , at any time @xmath28 , equal to that of the parent halo with a given ( cosmological ) spin parameter @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the angular momentum , energy and the virial mass of the halo , respectively , and @xmath32 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "observations and simulations suggest that the specific angular momentum of the baryonic disks indeed remain globally equal to the parent halos as the disks evolve despite the complex inflow and outflow patterns ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore do not impose cosmological initial conditions for the cumulative mass distribution of specific angular momentum found in dark matter only simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* in realistic disks , the radial gas inflows depend in a complex way on local conditions and global tidal torques and bar instabilities . in our model",
    "we assume an azimuthally averaged gas inflow velocity , @xmath25 , at each radius @xmath33 , and we consider three cases .",
    "the first two are ( _ a _ ) constant radial inflow velocity , @xmath34 , and ( _ b _ ) radial inflow velocity that satisfies @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the inflow velocity at the outer disk radius @xmath26 .",
    "the third case is motivated by a viscous disk in which the dissipated energy in one rotational timescale , which is of order @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the rotational velocity at each radius , is compensated by the gain in potential energy , @xmath40 @xcite , leading to ( _ c _ ) @xmath41 . our case ( _ c _ ) in combination with our mass conservation eqn .",

    "we assume this in  [ sec : cossnap ] , but relax this assumption in  [ sec : cosevol ] , which will force us back to eqn .",
    "( [ eq : dimen ] ) .    in terms of this dimensionless notation ,",

    "we start by solving the disk evolution equation for a  cosmological snapshot \" , for which the halo mass and cosmological inflow rates are constant , and the dimensionless version of our model is valid .",
    "we focus first on steady state solutions with (  [ sec : ysf ] ) and without (  [ sec : nsf ] ) star formation .",
    "we demonstrate that simple mass conservation naturally leads to disks with exponential profiles over many length scales .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : cca ] we examine the timescale for the convergence to steady - state .",

    "( [ eq : yqss ] ) shows that in the no - star formation no - dm case , the constant inflow velocity is a better fit to the physically motivated case ( _ c _ ) , in which the inflow velocity changes by @xmath78 per cent across the entire disk .    the dimensionless gas profiles , for all three inflow models , are generic results for @xmath69 , and do not depend on the accretion rate , the size of the disk or the sound speed .",
    "it is instructive to display these solutions dimensionally for a specific ( characteristic ) cosmological accretion rate @xmath16 and disk inflow velocity @xmath36 . in fig .",

    "it can be seen , that the surface density in all three cases , fits an exponential profile ( dashed lines , same colours ) quite well for the bulk of the disk . at the inner part of the disk",

    "in contrast , our profile shapes are essentially set by radial inflow and mass conservation only ( eqn .  ( [ eq : dimen ] ) ) .",
    "we interpret the divergence of the surface density towards the center as material that forms a bulge ( including a central black hole ) . in order to study the bulge to disk mass ratio ( b / d ) , defined as @xmath86 of our solutions ,",

    "* ) but we do not include such feedback effects in our computations .",
    "so far we have considered the gas steady state solution without any star formation or outflows .",

    "fixing @xmath79 to the two limiting cases , there is no difference between star formation and outflows . from a physical point of view , though , these are different in essence , since while outflowing gas escapes the gravitational potential of the disk , forming stars stay in the disk , and contribute to the gravitational potential , the rotational velocity and the toomre-@xmath15 parameter .",

    "the fact that the radial surface density profile is well approximated by an exponential profile is not true throughout the evolution of the disk .",

    "first , the halo growth rate , that depends on @xmath115 sets the baryonic accretion rate onto the disk . in our model",

    "[ sec : mhofz ] .",
    "+ second , the dm halo also affects the rotation curve of the baryonic disk . as a result not only",
    "the mere total halo mass is important , but also its spatial distribution @xmath120 .",
    "furthermore , due to the dependence of the rotation curve on the halo mass distribution , the inflow velocity and the disk size will also be affected .",

    "we neglect adiabatic contraction of the dark matter halos * * sound speed *  since in our model the gas inflow velocity is @xmath122 and @xmath123 , the gas sound speed is an essential parameter .",
    "higher sound speed means gas that flows inwards more efficiently , resulting in low @xmath42-values at large @xmath33 , with the addition of a larger numerator in @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , we expect that the larger the gas sound speed is , the harder it gets for the disk to form stars , and the smaller the stellar disk becomes .",
    "+ we follow the redshift evolution of the sound speed , as in @xcite , i.e. @xmath125 as noted in @xcite , this relation is valid over a wide range of redshifts",
    ". however , due to measurement uncertainties , @xmath50 shows a substantial scatter around this value ( for example @xmath126 at @xmath127 , and @xmath128 at @xmath3 ) .",

    "* disk size *  to constrain the disk size , we assume that the specific angular momentum of the accreted matter , @xmath130 , equals that of the parent dm halo , @xmath131 , where the accreted gas is assumed to be in centrifugal equilibrium with the disk , i.e. it starts rotating around the center of the disk at a rotational velocity @xmath132 immediately as it enters the disk . not making this assumption , necessarily means that other assumptions , about the time it takes the newly accreted gas to reach the disks rotational velocity and the amount of energy that is dissipated in this process , have to be made .",
    "it would also cause a situation in which at each radius @xmath33 , the gas rotation is inhomogeneous .",
    "since we assume that the cosmological accretion at each time is uniform across the disk , then the constraint on the conservation of the angular momentum reads @xmath133 therefore for a given @xmath134 , since we know the halo mass at each redshift , we can solve eqn .",

    "we wish to examine how the disk properties are modified when the halo or disk parameters are altered .",
    "we note that a key advantage of our approach  a simple toy - model of disk evolution  is that it enables scanning through a large parameter - space at a low computational cost .",
    "we focus on @xmath83 halos at @xmath3 , as for our fiducial model .",
    "we examine how the redshift at which star formation begins , @xmath184 , depends on @xmath50 and @xmath134 .",
    "since the initial conditions for our disk evolution are of a median halo and an empty disk that is fed by cosmological accretion , star formation can not take place until enough gas has been accreted and @xmath42 is large enough .",
    "the growing disk size , on the other hand , makes @xmath42 smaller , thus delaying the onset of star formation . the impact of having a large @xmath50 is threefold .",
    "first , the large inflow rate empties the gas at each radius more efficiently , resulting in reduced @xmath42 .",
    "second , it delays star formation due to the @xmath15-barrier it induces .",
    "third , as we show below , although counter - intuitive , larger @xmath50 results in larger disks , and hence smaller @xmath42 , thus delaying star formation .",
    "even though larger @xmath134 can also delay star formation , through the disk size , for @xmath134 from @xmath185 to @xmath186 , which we consider , its effect is weaker , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_l_first ] ( _ top left _ ) .",
    "interestingly , after star formation has begun , @xmath134 hardly has an effect on sfr , despite its effect on the disk size .",
    "qualitatively , increasing @xmath134 means increasing the angular momentum of the halo , and hence also of the accreted baryons .",
    "therefore , as @xmath134 increases , the disk size @xmath24 increases too .",
    "however , since the baryonic accretion onto the disk @xmath187 is independent of @xmath134 , then to first order the total baryonic mass in the disk will also be independent of @xmath134 . consequently ,",
    "even though large @xmath134 means smaller characteristic @xmath42 , as long as it is high enough to maintain @xmath138 , star formation , which is @xmath188 should proceed at more or less the same rate , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_l_first ] ( _ top right _ ) .",
    "nevertheless , there should exist a @xmath189 , that once reached , renders @xmath42 too low and @xmath15 too high , which will not allow any more star formation . in fig",
    "[ fig : lambdamax ] ( _ bottom - left axes _ ) we plot @xmath189 that allows star formation at @xmath3 , as a function of the gas sound speed , for our fiducial halo ( @xmath83 at @xmath3 ) , and for a slightly less massive halo ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath190 , as preferred by observations and simulations is well within the star forming portion of the parameter space , and becomes borderline only as the gas sound speed increases significantly . in fig  [ fig : lambdamax ] ( _ top - right axes _ )",
    "we plot the total sfr for the fiducial sound speed , as a function of @xmath134 .",
    "it can be seen that for @xmath134 altered by more than an order of magnitude , the total sfr changes by less than @xmath100 per cent , following our qualitative argument .",
    "studying the disk size , one might expect that since @xmath191 , then for higher sound speeds , the gaseous disk will be more compact , as the radial migration of the gas becomes more efficient .",
    "however , the disk size is primarily set by the baryonic accretion onto the disk , whose extent , in our model , is set by conservation of angular momentum .",
    "let us consider a halo of mass @xmath115 , with some specific angular momentum , @xmath131 that is , of course , independent of the sound speed .",
    "a larger @xmath50 at the early stages of the disk evolution , will result in a mass profile that is more concentrated near the center of the disk , and thus lower baryonic specific angular momentum .",
    "therefore , to satisfy the angular momentum constraint , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : amconstraint ] ) , the disk must grow for higher sound speeds .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_l_first ] ( _ bottom left _ ) , where we plot @xmath26 ( the truncation radius of the baryonic disk ) as a function of the gas sound speed and @xmath134 , for our fiducial halo at @xmath3 .    for the stellar disk size dependence on @xmath50 , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_l_first ] ( _ bottom right _ ) , we note that there are two competing effects . as @xmath50 increases , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) implies that in the outer regions of the disk , where @xmath42 is lower , star formation is suppressed .",
    "but , since the gaseous disk grows as @xmath50 grows , then the absolute size of the stellar disk is potentially larger , at least as long as overall @xmath15 is small enough .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_l_more ] we plot the corresponding @xmath192 ( _ top row _ ) and @xmath193 ( _ bottom row _ ) , the half mass radius and surface density of the gas ( _ left column _ ) and stars ( _ right column _ ) .",
    "it can be seen that regions in parameter space that result in small @xmath26 and @xmath194 have large @xmath193 .",
    "this is because small disks get a larger mass contribution from the central divergence of the surface density .",
    "the opposite is not exactly satisfied  the largest disks do not have the lowest half mass surface densities . for the gas component ,",
    "larger disks contain more baryons , and hence their characteristic surface density is higher , while for the stellar component not all of the parameter space results in disks that form stars , resulting in lower characteristic surface densities .",
    "owing to these effects , the total disk mass , as well as the relative gaseous and stellar contributions to it depend on @xmath50 and @xmath134 in a non - trivial way . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_l_msandmore ] ( _ top left _ ) , the total disk mass increases as the sound speed decreases , as one would expect , primarily due to the fact that higher @xmath50 results in a rapidly emptying disk , where the excess gas that inevitably reaches the center of the disk and ekected back to the hot halo .",
    "the hot halo is also fed by the outflowing baryons , whose mass @xmath195 sfr .",
    "the total hot gas mass due to these contributions , is plotted as a function of @xmath196 for our fiducial halo at @xmath3 in fig .  [",
    "fig : cs_l_msandmore ] ( _ top right _ ) .",
    "it can be seen that the hot gas mass depends very weakly on @xmath134 , similarly to the sfr .",
    "this implies that outflows constitute a significant part of the total hot gas mass .",
    "the relative contributions of gas and stars to the total disk mass can be read off fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_l_msandmore ] ( _ bottom left _ and _ bottom right _ ) ,          where we plot the gas fraction @xmath197 , and @xmath198 , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that except for the fact that the gas fraction is lower where sfr is higher , it exhibits a stronger dependence on @xmath134 than the sfr , since as argued above higher @xmath134 generates larger disks , that results in a smaller portion of it that forms stars .",
    "apart from @xmath134 and @xmath50 , another free parameter in our model is the mass loading factor @xmath14 .",
    "considering variation in @xmath14 from @xmath199 to @xmath200 results in insignificant modifications to the results reported above , and we thus do not pursue this @xmath14 analysis further .",
    "we note , however , that analysis of the extreme case @xmath201 , i.e. no outflows at all , shows a stronger dependence of sfr and @xmath202 on @xmath134 , verifying our argument about the importance of outflows to the hot gas mass .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the tight scaling relation between the sfr in disk galaxies and their stellar mass is remarkable .",
    "this scaling relation has been repeatedly observed , in many independent observations and different surveys .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to compare our model predictions to actual observations of sfr , and how well those predictions fall within the galaxy main sequence . in particular , we compare our model predictions to the best - fitting sfr-@xmath203 relation , as found in @xcite , for star forming galaxies between @xmath127 and @xmath171 @xmath204 where @xmath205 since the initial conditions of our simulated disks are of empty disk , and since , as we have shown , in our model star formation is initiated at @xmath172 , it is clear that the correspondence between our model predictions and eqn .",
    "( [ eq : whit ] ) can not hold for any high redshift , and thus we are interested in comparing these sfr s at a lower redshift , so that the disk has already reached an equilibrium . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfrscatter ]     relation ( or `` main sequence '' , as predicted by our model for various model parameters ( @xmath206 ) at @xmath3 , and the corresponding observed relation ( dashed ) according to @xcite . ]",

    "it can be seen from this plot that our model predicts very well the sfr-@xmath203 relation , even as @xmath196 and @xmath14 are varied .",
    "so far we have only considered the evolution of disks within a dm halo of mass @xmath83 at @xmath3 , and examined how perturbations to model parameters affect the evolution of those disks .",
    "we now wish to consider less massive halos .",
    "these imply smaller baryonic accretion rates , and hence less massive baryonic disks .",
    "this affects the disk size and sfr , and consequently also the gas fractions in the disks .",
    "reduced halo masses lead to smaller disks as less gas is accreted , but as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : changem ] ( _ top left _ ) , however , the dependence of the disk size on the halo mass weakens as @xmath50 decreases .    since a less massive halo means reduced baryonic accretion , and hence lighter gaseous disks , it is also to be expected that a smaller @xmath115 implies smaller sfr , for a given @xmath50 .",
    "as we have already shown , as @xmath50 increases , the characteristic gas surface density has to become larger to sustain star formation .",
    "therefore , for each @xmath50 there is the corresponding @xmath115 below which star formation is no longer possible , since @xmath208 at all times for all radii .",
    "this forms a star - formation threshold , which is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : changem ] ( _ bottom left _ ) of the sfr as a function of @xmath50 and @xmath115 at @xmath3 .",

    "the stellar disk size is monotonically decreasing as @xmath50 increases .",
    "this implies that for the less massive halos the fact that the total size of the gaseous disk increases as @xmath50 increases is subdominant to the @xmath15-barrier to star formation due to the increase of the gas sound speed .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : changem ] ( _ bottom right _ ) we plot the total stellar mass in the disk as a function of @xmath115 and @xmath50 at @xmath3 .",
    "we find that even though the total stellar mass increases monotonically with @xmath115 , as might be expected , it does not follow the general behavior of the stellar disk size discussed above , which means that maximising the star forming region does not guarantee a higher total sfr through that region .",
