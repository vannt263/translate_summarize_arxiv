    "power distribution grids are complex systems delivering electric power to millions of customers . in a typical distribution area ,",
    "electric power is distributed as a result of the interaction of thousands of components , some of which are electrical assets ( e.g. transformers , cables , switches ) , and others being physical assets ( e.g. poles , insulators ) which help support this propagation .",
    "in contrast to transmission grids that have a mesh structure , distribution grid networks have a radial structure , implying a minimum level of redundancy in the network structure .",
    "this minimum redundancy makes distribution networks more vulnerable to disturbances and external forces , calling for a complete power system security assessment of the distribution grids from various perspectives .",
    "the vulnerability analysis of power grids can be classified as the conventional vulnerability analysis and the structural vulnerability analysis  @xcite .",

    "the strong relationship between the topology and physical behaviour of power systems makes the structural vulnerability analysis a promising alternative .",

    "recent advances in the field of network science  @xcite reveal the promising potential of complex networks theory to investigate power grids vulnerability at a system level .",

    "the reliability indices can be defined for individual load points , or for the overall system .",
    "different approaches can be used to compute the reliability of a system including reliability block diagrams , markov methods , petri nets and monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",

    "the reliability indices ( as a result of a reliability analysis ) do provide reliability performances of the individual components , or overall system , however , they do not quantify the contribution of each component to the system reliability ( i.e. criticality ) . to determine the criticality of a component ,",

    "this approach from the _ reliability _ perspective provides a detailed and useful analysis on system reliability , accounting for important aspects such as age , condition , and individual failure probabilities of the assets .",
    "however , it does not provide any explicit insight in the topological vulnerabilities of the components in the system .",
    "moreover , it encounters various challenges including complexity of the computational methods and collecting accurate reliability data such as information on the material , age , and failure history of the asset which are not always available to the grid security analysts  @xcite .",
    "one complementary way to assess power system safety is structural robustness ( or vulnerability ) analysis , that is mainly performed from a complex networks theory perspective .",

    ", there has been no attempt on designing measures to quantitatively assess the robustness of an electrical _ distribution _ grids from a topological point of view .",
    "the contribution of a component to the overall system security is determined by ( i ) the reliability performance ( affected by say the type of the materials , ambient conditions , and age of the asset ) and ( ii ) the connectivity ( position relating to the topology ) of the asset .",
    "accordingly , a complete security assessment of an electric power distribution grid requires analysing both of the factors separately to assist the grid security analysts to identify the vulnerabilities and the asset managers to determine the criticality of assets in the system .",
    "as complementary to the probabilistic approach from the reliability point of view , this paper focuses on the assessment of the power system security from a _ topological _ point of view , and proposes a metric , _ upstream robustness _",
    ", to quantify the robustness of an asset with respect to supply availability in a electric power distribution grid .",
    "the robustness of power _ distribution _ grids heavily depends on the topology of the grid , mainly because of the minimum level of the redundancy in the system . due to this lack of topological redundancy , unlike in the power transmission grid , the loss of a single component can potentially result in topological disconnection of a sizable part of the grid from the sources and thus the disruption of the power delivery to the corresponding part of the grid .    therefore , measuring and managing redundancy in power distribution networks is of key importance .",
    "the redundancy of a component in a distribution grid is _ traditionally _ measured in terms of the number of alternative paths to that component from the sources .",
    "this number of alternative paths represents the number of different ways to reach an asset ( and ultimately customers ) .",
    "the presence of multiple alternative paths ( characterized by redundancy ) implies a more robust asset since even in case of a failure of one path due to loss of a single component along the path , the asset is still supplied power through other alternative paths , preventing it from being single sourced and vulnerable to single point failures in the system .",
    "however , the existence of multiple alternative paths to an asset does not necessarily protect it from being affected by single point failures .",
    "this is especially the case when such alternative paths have common components between them .",
    "even though multiple paths exist between the asset and source(s ) , the failure of a common component still disconnects the asset from the sources . hence , as much as the _ redundancy _ ( i.e. the number of paths ) , the _ quality _ of this redundancy with respect to the exact configuration and involved components , also has a crucial role in determining the robustness of the asset with respect to supply availability .",
    "the number of alternative paths to an asset evaluates the redundancy of the asset to receive electric power and the level of disjointness and the length of these paths determine the quality of this redundancy .",
    "[ fig : robustnessvsredundancy ] illustrates the relationship between the robustness and the redundancy along with its quality . in the first topology in fig .",
    "[ fig : robustnessvsredundancy].a , only one path exists between the target node @xmath0 and the source @xmath1 .",
    "the target node is not redundant , and any failure of the components in the upstream results in disconnection of node @xmath0 from the source . in the second and third topology",
    ", two alternative paths exist between the target node @xmath0 and the source node @xmath1 .",
    "these paths are partially disjoint in the second topology , while they are completely disjoint in the last topology . as a result of two completely disjoint paths , in the second topology ,",
    "all of the components are backed up and no single component failure causes disconnection of @xmath0 from the source @xmath1 , as opposed to the second topology in which the single failure of node @xmath2 results in the disconnection of @xmath0 from @xmath1 across both available paths .",
    "in addition to the disjointness of alternative paths , the length of these paths ( in terms of number of the assets in these paths ) is another aspect contributing to the quality of the redundancy in a power distribution grid .",
    "each additional component in a path introduces additional uncertainty and vulnerability by increasing the number of the components on which @xmath0 depends to be connected to the sources in the system .    to quantify the robustness of an asset ,",
    "the _ upstream robustness _ captures the redundancy of the network along with its quality by accounting for ( i ) the number of alternative paths ( from sources ) to the asset , and ( ii ) the disjointness and ( iii ) the length of these alternative paths .",
    "the proposed metric upstream robustness @xmath3 relies on two main concepts ; the inter - path independency and intra - path independency .",
    "this section introduces these concepts , explains the computational methodology , and elaborates on how these concepts are combined to quantify the upstream robustness of a given asset .",
    "the upstream robustness of an asset @xmath0 is a weighted sum of the inter - path independency values of all possible paths to @xmath0 .",

    "a set of alternative paths @xmath6 to @xmath0 that is obtained by e.g. a breadth - first search algorithm  @xcite , quantifying the disjointness of these paths requires capturing the impact of ( i ) the number of common components between these alternative paths , and ( ii ) the length of these paths to determine the fraction of the common components within a path .",

    "fig : toynetworkcriticalities ] , sources in the substation a do not have 100% criticality for the system .",
    "the region covered by substation a is fed by multiple sources .",
    "each source feeds a part of the network , and some parts of the network are fed by multiple sources .",
    "consequently , a loss of a single source affects only that part of the network which is nt redundant ; the remainder of the network can still be supported by the 5 other sources in the system .",
    "[ fig : criticalitydistributionpiechart ] illustrates how the criticality of the assets in _ substation a _ ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lilynetworkcriticalities ] ) is distributed over all assets . in _ substation",
    "a _ , only 31 out of nearly 5000 components have a criticality larger than 25% , 39 more have a criticality that is larger than 20 % , and in total 166 components with a criticality more than 10% . hence , less than 2% of all components have a criticality larger than 20% , and less than 4% of the components in the system have a criticality more than 10% . on the other hand , more than 80% of the assets in the system",
    "have a criticality of less than 1% suggesting that removal of these components have a very minor impact on the robustness of other assets in the system .        as in every complex system , including the power distribution grid , the relative importance of the components in the system is highly skewed and non - uniform .",
    "a very small subset of the components is significantly critical for the system , while a greater portion of components have relatively small criticality values . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lilynetworkcriticalities ] , the criticality analysis based on the upstream robustness identifies these critical components in _ substation a _ effectively , showing the value of such metrics in assisting asset managers for appropriate decision - making on investment plans .",
    "utility companies typically assess the robustness of their network at different levels of grid abstraction .",
    "the first method corresponds to a circuit level analysis where traditional reliability engineering techniques and concepts are focussed on .",
    "a circuit is traced from its source and feeder in the substation towards downstream components .",
    "while doing so , the condition of the involved assets are estimated and used as a proxy for individual asset robustness and overall system reliability .",
    "a more topological driven approach is employed when it comes to criticality assessment .",
    "the whole network is divided into protective zone regions based on the presence of protective devices such as fuses , reclosers and sectionalizers .",
    "the count of customers is aggregated in each of these protective zones , and used as a kpi ( key performance indicator ) to denote the effective deployment of protective devices in the grid .",
    "both these techniques fail to in capture the presence of alternate paths of electrical distribution in the grid which is enabled by devices such as switches and open points .",
    "this combined with the knowledge of path length and path disjointness results in a much more useful and accurate way of computing network robustness , which has been the focus of our work .",
    "this paper proposes the upstream robustness @xmath3 to quantify the robustness of an asset against disturbances to receive supply from the sources .",
    "the computation of the upstream robustness of an asset @xmath15 , @xmath41 , requires measuring the redundancy along with the quality of the redundancy of the topology between the asset @xmath15 and the source(s ) in the network .",
    "the upstream robustness achieves this by accounting for three main aspects of the topology : ( i ) the number of alternative paths ( from sources ) to the asset , ( ii ) the level of disjointness of these alternative paths , ( iii ) the number of the assets in these alternative paths .",
    "the alternative paths to an asset is determined by a _ breadth first search _ algorithm .",
    "the disjointness of these alternative paths to each other is modelled by _",
    "inter - path independency _ while the impact of the length of these paths on the assets robustness is captured by _ intra - path independency_. combining these ( inter)dependencies , the upstream robustness of the asset is computed .",
    "the proposed metric is used to assess the criticality of the assets in a given distribution grid .",
    "@xmath3 is applied on the real - world data of a distribution substation network to investigate the criticality of the assets in the system .",
    "these results are compared with the results from a traditional complex networks metric , betweenness centrality , and the differences between two approach are discussed .",
    "experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed metric @xmath3 as a measure for asset criticality analysis to assist asset managers in appropriate decision - making regarding the investment and maintenance planning of the grid .",
    "yet , it should not be the only approach to consider when making investment decisions to improve a grid . as is true with most power distribution grid utilities , factors like customer priority ( such as assets serving important industrial customers or critical services like hospitals ) , regulatory requirements , capacity constraints , health of individual assets , and economic benefits",
    "should also be considered and given their due weightage .",
    "that said , because of the large number of assets involved to make the system work , not only does this technique provide a new lens to assess assets , but also a way to rank them when the other factors are equal .",
    "this paper focuses on the robustness assessment of traditional power distribution grids .",
    "future work focusses on making the proposed metric applicable for the smart grid case .",
    "accounting for the smart power distribution grids requires slight adjustments to the proposed metric .",
    "for instance , the introduction of prosumer concept in smart grids enables bidirectional flow rather than a unidirectional power flow as it is now in a traditional power distribution grid .",
    "incorporating the impact of bidirectional power flow into the proposed approach requires determining all possible paths between an asset and sources with the assumption of undirected graph modelling of the grid rather than directed graph .",
    "the future work will focus on incorporating all such aspects so that the metric can also be deployed to assess the robustness of smart grids .",
    "additionally , the proposed metric will also be applied on various relevant problems including evaluation of the right locations for adding assets ( such as cables , transformers , and batteries ) for future network expansion planning .",
