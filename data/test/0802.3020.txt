    "as expected , our method gives a fuv attenuation @xmath321.5 mag lower than the standard conversion implying a factor @xmath324 difference in the sfr surface density profile obtained from the fuv profile ( fig.[n4569 ] , right panel ) .",
    "the results obtained with our technique are supported by the very good agreement with the sfr density profile independently obtained from the h@xmath89 line ( corrected for extinction using balmer decrement ; fig .",
    "[ n4569 ] right panel , empty triangles ) . in fact only a recent ( @xmath91 yr ) starburst @xmath32100 times stronger than the normal star formation rate in ngc  4569 could reconcile the difference between the sfr obtained from the h@xmath89 and from the fuv corrected with the standard methods @xcite : an extremely unlikely scenario as discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ this exercise shows the crucial importance of the age dependent @xmath6 vs @xmath7 relations in the panchromatic study of resolved galaxies .",
    "the need of empirical methods to correct for dust attenuation is particular important for the study of uv properties of large samples of galaxies lacking far - infrared rest - frame data .",
    "of particular importance for our understanding of galaxy evolution is the correct interpretation of the uv - optical colour magnitude ( cm ) relation , as recently discussed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is very difficult to use a single correction technique able to deal simultaneously with starbursts , low ssfr objects and elliptical galaxies .",
    "of particular importance is the correct estimate of @xmath7 for transition objects : galaxies with low ssfr for which the standard corrections calibrated on active star forming systems are likely to be not valid . in order to quantify the influence of the _ age effect _ on our interpretation of the uv - optical colour magnitude relation",
    "we compare our method with the age independent recipes using a sample of galaxies extracted from galex observations of the coma cluster region ( gi - cycle 1 , cortese et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this sample includes all galaxies detected in both fuv and nuv bands as well as with sdss - dr6 @xmath92 photometry and with spectroscopic redshift data available ( 833 galaxies ) . since for this large sample",
    "far infrared observations are not available , we use the second method described in sec.[recipe ] , determining the @xmath6 ratio from the @xmath69 colour and @xmath11 from the @xmath93 colour .",
    "the @xmath94 colour-@xmath95 magnitude relation obtained is compared with the observed one ( i.e. not corrected for internal extinction ) in fig.[cm ] ( left panel ) .",
    "whereas galaxies in the blue sequence ( @xmath96 4 mag ) have an average fuv dust attenuation @xmath711.5 - 2 mag , galaxies in the red sequence ( @xmath976 mag ) show ( as expected ) a very low amount of attenuation ( @xmath71 0.5 mag ) and occupy almost the same parameter space as uncorrected data .",
    "the separation between the red and blue sequences is therefore more evident after the correction for dust attenuation .",
    "we remark that our technique should not be blindly applied to elliptical galaxies , since in these objects uv emission comes from old stellar populations and not young stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however if an accurate morphological classification is not available the use of the recipes presented here does not introduce a strong systematic bias in the data , as shown in fig.[cm ] ( left panel ) .",
    "this result indicates that our procedures are reliable for old as well as young stellar populations , contrary to previous empirical methods , calibrate and valid only for active star - forming galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is clearly evident in fig.[cm ] ( right panel ) where the cm relation obtained with our recipe is compared with the one determined by using the age - independent method to convert the @xmath69 colour into @xmath7 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the difference between the two cm relations is quite impressive : while no significative difference is observed in blue - sequence galaxies , the red sequence shifts @xmath322 mag towards bluer colours and the gap between the blue and red sequence ( i.e. the so - called `` green valley '' , @xcite ) is considerably reduced .",
    "a similar result has been recently shown by @xcite when comparing the cm relation determined using the balmer decrement as indicator of dust attenuation with the one estimated using the recipes proposed by @xcite .",
    "this result shows how strong the bias can be when blindly using the recipes to estimate @xmath7 without taking into account the _ age effect _ , leading to an incorrect interpretation of the data and reconstruction of galaxy s evolution history .",
    "we have investigated the dependence of the @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 relation on the average age of galaxy stellar populations . our simple method has shown that even for spiral galaxies the use of a standard ( i.e. not age dependent ) conversion of the @xmath6 into @xmath7 leads to a systematic overestimate ( i.e. @xmath981 mag ) of the dust attenuation in galaxies with low specific star - formation , mainly anemic cluster spirals .",
    "this systematic bias strongly affects our interpretation of uv observations and can produce a significant overestimate ( up to a factor 10 ) of the star formation rate , particularly in hi deficient galaxies .",
    "therefore we have developed different methods for determining the uv dust attenuation taking into account the age dependence of the @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 relation .",
    "these recipes require only an uv colour and an uv - optical / near infrared colour providing an estimate of the uv attenuation with an average uncertainty varying from @xmath32 + 0.1/-0.25 mag for @xmath336 gyr ( @xmath865 mag ) to a maximum of + 0.4/-0.8 mag for @xmath87 gyr ( 7@xmath818.5 mag ) , when far - infrared observations are available , and from @xmath32 + 0.5/-0.7 mag for @xmath336 gyr ( @xmath865 mag ) to a maximum of @xmath32 + 1/-1.2 mag for @xmath87 gyr ( 7@xmath818.5 mag ) when far - infrared data are not available .",
    "the small amount of multiwavelength data necessary for their application makes these methods extremely useful for the widest possible range of application eventually providing us with a less biased view of the uv properties of galaxies in the local universe and at higher redshift .",

    "are the results obtained in this work and the recipes proposed to estimate the uv dust attenuation model - dependent ? in order to answer to this question ,",
    "in this section we investigate the dependence of our results on the three free parameters entering our model : the shape of the extinction law , the dust geometry and the star formation history .    in fig.[modgeo ] ( left ) we show the @xmath6 vs @xmath7 relation obtained for different values @xmath11 , a sandwich geometry and three different extinction laws : lmc ( solid line ) , milky way ( dotted line ) and small magellanic cloud ( dashed line ) . as already pointed out by several authors ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", the @xmath6 vs @xmath7 relation is almost independent of the extinction law with a typical variation limited to @xmath410.2 mag , considerably lower than the effect of @xmath11 on the @xmath6 vs @xmath7 relation .",
    "similar results are obtained if we investigate the effect of different dust geometries . in fig.[modgeo ] ( right ) we compare the results obtained for the sandwich model ( solid line ) with a simple slab geometry ( @xcite , dashed line ) .",
    "we also added the results for a @xcite attenuation law ( dotted line ) . even in this case , we observed no dependence of the @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 relation on the dust geometry within @xmath410.2 mag .",
    "similar results are obtained if we use the homogeneous and clumpy dust models proposed by @xcite ( not shown ) .    finally , we fitted the 191 galaxies in our sample with various sed libraries in order to test the dependence of the results presented in sec.[data ] and sec.[recipe ] from sfh and age .",
    "the sed library used in sec.[model ] has been obtained by fixing the shape of the sfh ( assumed to be a la sandage ) , the age of the galaxy ( assumed equal to 13 gyr ) and the stellar initial mass function ( imf , assumed to be a salpeter imf ) .",
    "we produced different set of sed libraries varying every time one of these three free parameters and we fitted them to the data .",
    "in particular we considered an exponential sfh , a fixed ( @xmath10=13 gyr ) or free ( in the range 0@xmath9915 gyr ) age and a @xcite imf . in fig.[modsfh ] is presented the difference in the estimate of @xmath7 between the library adopted in sec.[model ] and some of the various combination adopted . for each combination",
    "the standard deviation in the estimate of @xmath7 is lower than 0.1 - 0.2 mag .",
    "this result was somehow expected since the @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 relation is only affected by the actual shape of the sed and not by the shape of the past ( older than 1 - 2 gyr ) sfh .",
    "we remark that our results are not applicable only in the case of an embedded starburst in a galaxy with a second older , less embedded stellar population @xcite . at uv and ir wavelengths ,",
    "the starburst would dominate , but at optical and near - ir wavelengths the older population would dominate .",
    "however , at least for spiral galaxies in the local universe this seems not to be the case @xcite and smooth sfh like a la sandage and exponential well reproduce the observations ( e.g. @xcite )    we can therefore conclude that the results obtained from our model and the recipes presented in this work are model - independent at least within @xmath320.2 mag .",
    "this uncertainty is still lower or equal to the uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath7 from our recipes .",
    "in this appendix we discuss the possibility to extend our recipes to the nuv band in the case that galex - fuv observations are available .",
    "the galex - nuv filter ( @xmath46 ) lies in a region where the sed of galaxies with @xmath100 4 gyr is strongly dependent on stellar metallicity for @xmath101 ( e.g. see fig .",
    "6 in @xcite ) .",
    "this strongly affects the @xmath102 vs @xmath83 relation which , for low values of @xmath11 , can vary of even 0.4 mag from @xmath103 to @xmath104 , apparently complicating the use of our model directly on the nuv band .",
    "however for none of the galaxies with @xmath100 4 gyr in our sample the best fitting model has metallicity lower than @xmath103 , consistent with the fact that in the local universe evolved galaxies tend to be metal rich ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore for @xmath100 4 gyr we compute the average @xmath102 vs @xmath83 relation by combining only the relations obtained in the metallicity range @xmath105 .",
    "this makes our recipes not valid for @xmath100 4 gyr and @xmath106 .",
