    "possible electronic phase separation ( eps ) in the cuprates has usually been found in terms of stripe phases .",
    "thus , neutron diffraction measurements find evidence for fluctuating stripe order in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( lsco ) associated with incommensurate inelastic neutron scattering@xcite , which can be transformed into long range charged stripe order@xcite by co - doping with nd or eu .",
    "similar incommensurate peaks are found in other cuprates , and long range charge ordered states are also found@xcite in strongly underdoped samples of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( ybco ) , with stripes parallel to the chains , while at higher doping short range stripe order is found at virtually all temperatures up to the pseudogap t@xmath6 .",
    "however , eps can also manifest itself in the form of _ larger domains _ , particularly if the dopant ions are somewhat mobile and can follow the hole motion .",
    "these domains , long known in la@xmath3cuo@xmath7 may recently have been found in scanning tunneling microscope ( stm)@xcite and microwave@xcite studies of bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath8 ( bi2212 ) .",
    "stripes are typically interpreted either in terms of charged domain walls in antiferromagnets or of restricted eps . while the models are virtually indistinguishible in the underdoped regime , they diverge as doping increases .",
    "a phase separation model implies the existence of a uniform end phase : at some doping antiferromagnetic ( afm ) stripes must disappear , leaving a uniform state similar to that found on the charged stripes . for slightly lower doping the afm stripes form a minority",
    " a situation not possible in a domain wall picture .",
    "( a note of caution : more recent domain wall models find a lower doping on the charged stripes , and as the doping decreases , the distinction between the two models gradually blurs . )",
    "evidence for the termination of the afm stripes at a fixed doping@xcite and recent observations of larger domain structures@xcite taken together provide extremely strong support for a phase separation scenario .",
    "at this point it is essential to better characterize the nature of the stripes , in particular the charged stripes , and to understand how their properties affect physical phenomena , in particular photoemission spectra.@xcite while fluctuations@xcite play an important role in the real cuprates , we have constructed ordered stripe arrays , for which detailed tight - binding calculations are possible@xcite .",
    "such calculations can aid in elucidating the structure of the charged stripes , both for wide stripes  what stabilizes the preferred hole density  and for narrow stripes ",
    "how do quantum size effects ( qse ) modify properties of the stripes .",
    "the present paper provides an extended analysis of these issues ; some of these results were summarized recently@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii enumerates key issues which must be addressed in any eps model of stripes , including determination of the hole density on charged stripes .",
    "it is found that the model can simultaneously account for a large number of experimental results .",
    "the charged stripes are probably stabilized by some competing order , either magnetic or paramagnetic ( including charge density waves ) .",
    "section iii shows that magnetic charged stripes can arise in a mean field hubbard model , and can be either ferromagnetic or a linear antiferromagnetic ( laf ) phase similar to the white - scalapino stripes@xcite .",
    "calculations on stripe arrays find that the charged stripes lead to midgap states near the fermi level ; section iv shows how these data can be interpreted in terms of quantum size effect ( qse ) on single stripes .",
    "section v presents the results of single stripe calculations : competing charge density wave ( cdw ) and superconducting orders can exist on paramagnetic stripes , but they are strongly modified by the qse .",
    "on laf stripes , d - wave superconductivity and an unusual form of cdw are both found to persist down to the narrowest ( 2 cells wide ) stripes .",
    "section vi includes results on stripe arrays : the laf stripes produce photoemission constant - energy maps in significantly better agreement with experiment . in the discussion , section vii ,",
    "we summarize additional recent evidence which favors a phase separation model  in particular , evidence that afm stripes terminate slightly beyond optimal doping , where superconducting properties remain strong , and that a second regime of phase separation exists above optimal doping  and we show that experiments are consistent with our prediction that the superconducting gap grows in the underdoped regime .",
    "conclusions are given in section viii .",
    "a phase separation model of stripes is characterized by the two well - defined stable end phases between which phase separation takes place .",
    "the insulating stripes are generally understood to be antiferromagnetic ( afm )  essentially the same as the mott insulator found in undoped cuprates .",
    "the hole - doped stripes are assumed to have a finite doping , @xmath9 .",
    "this simple idea has three experimentally verifiable characteristic features : ( i ) _ the stripe phase must terminate _",
    "when @xmath10 ; ( ii ) there will be a _ crossover _ at a lower doping , @xmath11 from magnetic - dominated ( @xmath12 ) to charge - dominated ( @xmath13 ) stripe arrays ; ( iii ) some _ interaction _ on the charged stripes stabilizes the end phase at @xmath9 .",
    "here we discuss current evidence for ( a ) the doping on the charged stripes , ( b ) evidence for a crossover , and ( c ) the nature of the dominant interaction stabilizing the charged stripes .",
    "in addition , we ask what constraints the yamada plot puts on the model , and how a model based on eps compares to a domain wall model .",
    "recent evidence suggests that the stripes and pseudogap terminate at the same doping @xmath9 while superconductivity persists to higher doping@xcite .",
    "however , the proper choice of @xmath9 requires some discussion .",
    "the neutron diffraction measurements of tranquada@xcite and yamada@xcite have established that charged stripes in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath14 ( lsco ) have an invariant topology over the doping range @xmath15 , acting as antiphase boundaries ( apbs ) for the afm stripes and having a net doping of 0.5 holes per stripe . however , there are two models for how this charge is distributed : either in one row with average hole density 0.5 hole per copper site or in two rows with 0.25 hole per copper .",
    "these two alternatives are often somewhat simplistically referred to as site order vs bond order .",
    "the strongest evidence distinguishing between the alternatives comes from x - ray data on the charge order@xcite at @xmath16=1/8 : non - observation of diffraction harmonics suggests a sinusoidal distribution of charge . for a 4-cu repeat distance , two insulating and two charged rows would be exactly sinusoidal , whereas one charged and three insulating rows should have signifigant harmonic content .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xmath17sr lineshape analysis@xcite . however , the charge ordering peaks are weak , and it remains possible that fluctuations or disorder could wash out the harmonics .",
    "direct evidence for the density on the charged stripes is found from low temperature nqr measurements@xcite , which find values @xmath18 . while this is close to the lower value",
    ", the small difference can also be understood : this is a _ local _ measurement , and it is expected that some holes will be pushed off onto the magnetic stripes .",
    "indirect evidence favoring the lower hole density includes the fact that it is easier to understand the properties of afm stripes in terms of even - leg ladders ( e.g. , the afm stripes would be two coppers wide at @xmath16=1/8)@xcite , and that the stripe phase appears to terminate when the average doping approaches @xmath16=0.25 ( section vii.a.1 ) .",
    "the lower doping is also more consistent with the tj model simulations of white and scalapino@xcite .",
    "tallon@xcite finds an optimal doping at @xmath19 for all cuprates , with respect to which the stripes terminate at a doping @xmath20 .",
    "however , it is hard to reconcile a common optimal doping with muon spin resonance data@xcite , which find @xmath21 is optimized at very different values of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the pair density , which seems to scale with carrier concentration@xcite , and @xmath24 effective mass ) for lsco and ybco .",
    "we assume instead that @xmath25 scales with @xmath26 , so if @xmath19 for lsco , it is 0.21 for ybco , in good agreement with several estimates@xcite .",
    "this also resolves a problem with the thermopower . while the thermopower appears to be universal for most cuprates , and the best means of estimating the doping is from the room temperature thermopower , lsco is anomalous in that ` overdoped ' samples still have high thermopower@xcite .",
    "if the doping for ybco is rescaled as above , however , the thermopower data of lsco fall on the universal curve .",
    "hence , the anomaly for lsco is not in the thermopower , but in a too low value of @xmath21 , which is accompanied by a too low value of @xmath25 .",
    "it is likely that these features are associated with a competing ltt phase , which is most prominent in lsco , and which also leads to the most nearly static stripe correlations .",
    "taking @xmath25=0.21 for ybco gives @xmath27 , which we believe holds for _ all cuprates _ , including lsco , section vii.a.1 .",
    "this would lead to very wide charged stripes near optimal doping : the width of the charged stripes @xmath28 satisfies @xmath29 , or @xmath30 cu wide .",
    "hence , models of isolated quasi - one - dimensional charged stripes are likely to be valid only in the far underdoped regime , while for the good superconductors a better model would be a metal with intrinsic weak links@xcite .      for @xmath31",
    ", the crossover @xmath32 can be identified with the 1/8 anomaly , where both charged and afm stripes have their minimal width ( 2 cu atoms ) .",
    "there is considerable evidence that the doping 1/8 , in addition to its special stability , acts as a crossover in the properties of the stripes .",
    "thus , uchida , et al.@xcite , studying the hall coefficient @xmath33 , find a crossover from one - dimensional behavior ( @xmath34 as @xmath35 ) for @xmath36 to two dimensional behavior ( coupled charged stripes ) for @xmath13 . in ybco , the spin gap grows slowly with doping for @xmath12 , then more rapidly for @xmath13 ; this behavior can be understood in terms of coupled spin ladders , as the coupling changes with the width of the charged stripes@xcite . in eu substituted lsco@xcite , the meissner fraction is negligibly small for @xmath12 , then grows roughly linearly with doping until @xmath37 , staying large up to at least @xmath38 .",
    "finally , the two - magnon raman peak in lsco has a splitting at low temperatures which has been associated with stripes@xcite , on analogy with similar observations in la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 ( lsno)@xcite .",
    "for @xmath12 the ratio of the two peak frequencies is constant and consistent with a simple stripe model ; for @xmath39 the lower frequency starts decreasing with doping .",
    "moreover , the higher frequency loses intensity with doping ; near @xmath40 , the _ intensity _ of one mode approximately disappears , while the _ frequency _ of the other mode extrapolates to zero .",
    "= 0.25 0.5 cm = 0.48 0.5 cm    the yamada@xcite plot , fig .",
    "[ fig : y1]a , provides a severe constraint on any model of stripes : in lsco the incommensurability @xmath41 is found to grow linearly with doping for @xmath12 but to saturate for @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , the saturation value is just the incommensurability expected for @xmath43-doped stripes , @xmath44 .",
    "a similar saturation has been reported in ybco , but different groups find different values for @xmath45 : @xmath46 [ ] or @xmath47 [ ] . if one of these values proves correct , it would suggest some nonuniversality in @xmath9 , perhaps associated with bilayer splitting . in the domain wall model ,",
    "the saturation is interpreted as evidence that the stripes stop changing in width , and additional holes leak into the antiferromagnetic background , washing out the stripes .    for @xmath48",
    ", the eps model agrees with the yamada plot , fig .",
    "[ fig : y1]b : increase in doping causes the afm stripes to narrow , with no changes in the charged stripes .",
    "note that , for concreteness we have assumed that the charged stripes have laf order ( section iii ) ; these stripes naturally act as antiphase boundaries ( apbs ) , consistent with the neutron evidence . however , the naive prediction of the eps model is in disagreement with the yamada plot for @xmath49 , fig .",
    "[ fig : y1]c : as the charge stripes get wider , the incommensurability should decrease , while the neutron peaks may broaden if the wider charge stripes do not act as apbs . this behavior is not observed .",
    "however , the model can be simply modified to explain the observed saturation , fig .",
    "[ fig : y1]d , e .",
    "this would be a commensurability effect , with part of the sample pinned at 1/8 doping while the rest forms a different phase ( e.g. , at 1/4 doping ) where no stripes are present .",
    "such behavior is well known in nickelates , where coexistence of 1/3 and 1/2 stripes is common .",
    "evidence for such commensurability effects can be found by comparing@xcite the chemical potential @xmath17 in lsco@xcite and lsno@xcite . in both materials , @xmath17 is approximately independent of doping between half filling ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 , with @xmath52 in lsco , 1/3 in lsno , which has long - range charge order .",
    "remarkably , the simple prediction of a macroscopic phase separation model ( @xmath17 constant throughout the phase separation regime ) is violated in lsno : @xmath17 is _ not _ constant for @xmath53 , although the stripe phase persists over the full doping range .",
    "this is presumably a commensurability effect , reflecting the coexistence of 1/3 and 1/2 stripe phases for intermediate dopings .",
    "the same doping dependence of @xmath17 is found in lsco : constant for @xmath54 , variable for @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , the lsno data can be scaled to that of the cuprates , giving a common doping dependence @xmath55 in both compounds@xcite .",
    "recently local charged domains have been directly visualized by stm studies in bi2212@xcite with gaps ranging from slightly overdoped to strongly underdoped .",
    "such behavior is extremely difficult to explain in the domain wall picture , but is easy to understand in terms of eps , and indeed is consistent with the commensurability effects discussed above .",
    "the gap distribution is found to be broad rather than bimodal , but that is expected since eps is very sensitive to charged impurities , and the local gap will correlate with the local density of dopant , presumably interstitial oxygen in bi2212 .",
    "this sensitivity to impurities leads to the question of which came first : is a preexisting eps sensitive to local impurities , or does oxygen clustering@xcite provide the driving mechanism for domain formation ?",
    "since the electronic inhomogeneity seems characteristic of most cuprates while there is considerable variety in the doping counterions , the simpler interpretation would appear to be that the eps is primary .",
    "thus , in la@xmath3cuo@xmath7 ( lco ) , the interstitial oxygens are highly mobile , allowing the domains to grow to macroscopic size .",
    "similar clusters form in ybco ( here associated with chain oxygens ) , but can be suppressed in fully oxygenated samples by quenching@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "well formed stripes appear when the doping counterions are least mobile , in lsco .",
    "the domains in bi2212 would seem to be consistent , but a number of questions remain about the role of annealing .",
    "while these domains are regularly found in stm studies when the samples are cleaved at low - temperature , they can be annealed out at high temperatures@xcite .",
    "this could be caused by a ` melting ' of the eps , as is found in lco near room temperature@xcite , and can be tested by careful annealing studies .",
    "alternatively , it may be a question of pinning the eps .",
    "certainly , it is known that a weak domain disorder is necessary to pin vortices , to observe the vortex lattice via stm.@xcite also , the role of the interstitial oxygen in the superlattice modulations in bi2212 needs to be better understood .",
    "the strength of this modulation suggests that it is associated with an ordering of the interstitial oxygen , but this should lead to a strong correlation between the domains and the superlattice , which seems not to be the case .",
    "further evidence for electronic inhomogeneity comes from microwave measurements : anomalies in bi2212 have been interpreted in terms of similar electronic domains@xcite , suggesting that they are representative of the bulk , while measurements on other cuprates@xcite find similar anomalous behavior which was interpreted in terms of pinned cdw s , possibly stripe related .",
    "a domain picture would also explain the persistence of nodal quasiparticles in the underdoped regime , at least down to 1/8 doping@xcite .",

    "domain wall models arose in early unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) calculations@xcite for the doped tj model , as heterogeneous ground states in which the holes are confined to domain walls between afm domains which act as apbs .",
    "these domain walls are not driven by phase separation@xcite ; the phase is realized as a long - period modulated afm , with holes doping the rows of spins where the moment changes sign@xcite . when @xmath65 , there is one hole per row , a large hole doping which is inconsistent both with experiments on stripes in the cuprates , and with density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations@xcite .",
    "more recent calculations reduce the doping , in ways that bring the model close to the phase separation picture : ( 1 ) assuming cdw order along the charged stripes@xcite lowers @xmath9 to 0.5 , while ( 2 ) letting @xmath66 results in @xmath67.@xcite since the cdw order ( case 1 ) lowers the free energy of the charged stripes , it should be possible to dope the system all the way to a pure cdw at @xmath68 . in case 2 ,",
    "it is not explained why a low density appears ; a good possibility is that this doping corresponds to the van hove singularity ( vhs ) , as in the phase separated stripes .",
    "( this could be checked by varying @xmath69 and calculating @xmath70 . )",
    "if such low - density domain walls do exist , the striped phase must somehow terminate when the average doping approached 0.2 , but how this happens is not explained .",
    "however , this calculation@xcite is not fully uhf , being restricted to periodic arrays , and uhf calculations@xcite find instead ferromagnetic charged stripes which can be understood within a phase separation model ( see below ) .",
    "since the stability of these @xmath71 domain wall stripes is unclear , in table i a comparison is made with the earlier , higher - hole - density domain wall models .",
    "for such high doping , stripe termination at @xmath72 , or a major crossover near 1/8 , are both difficult to interpret .",
    "stripes as apbs are more natural in domain wall models , but we shall show that they can also arise in eps models . note that the distinction between the models may be becoming moot , since in the domain wall models there is now a search for a ` hidden ' order parameter@xcite , and it is common for secondary order parameters to be expressed predominantly on domain walls of the primary order@xcite",
    ".    in conclusion , assumption of a charged stripe doping @xmath73 reconciles the neutron diffraction data , evidence for a termination of the stripe phase near @xmath9 , and the 1/8 anomaly as a crossover effect near @xmath74 , while    commensurability effects can explain the saturation in the yamada plot and the stm observation of charge domains .",
    "further supportive evidence will be presented in section vii.a . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will assume that @xmath75",
    ".      in any phase separation model , a key issue is understanding the nature of the charged stripes . indeed , since superconductivity seems to arise predominantly on these stripes , such understanding is likely to play an important role in elucidating the origin of the high superconducting transition temperatures . for the stripe phase to exist",
    ", the doping @xmath9 must be particularly _ stable_. this can arise via an electronic _ instability _ , which opens up a gap over much of the fermi surface , making the electronic phase nearly incompressible .",
    "this ` stability from instability ' is a fairly general feature , underlying , e.g. , hume - rothery alloys@xcite .",
    "[ this is a modification of an argument due to anderson@xcite . ] here , we explore a number of candidates for the predominant electronic instability .    in a related paper@xcite , we will provide strong evidence that this ` hidden order ' is a form of cdw , which could include the flux phase .",
    "however , here we will explore a wider variety of possibilities .",
    "one issue is that in the low doping limit the charge stripes act as apbs for the afm stripes .",
    "such an effect arises naturally if the charged stripes have some residual magnetic interaction , and we will explore this possibility . however , in nickelates charged stripes coupled to a cdw are found to act as apbs@xcite .",
    "the large hubbard on - site repulsion @xmath76 plays an important role .",
    "strong correlation effects lead to two classes of charged stripe phases : either the constraint against double occupancy leads to magnetic order ( magnetic charged stripes ) or kinetic energy dominates , leading to a magnetically disordered phase ( paramagnetic charged stripes ) , with correlations leading to reduced hopping , as in tj@xcite and slave boson@xcite models .",
    "section iii will provide examples of both classes , denoted as class b and class a stripes , respectively .",
    "class a stripes could be simply correlated metals ( as in tj or slave boson calculations ) or could have additional , e.g. , cdw , order .",
    "a crossover from magnetic to correlated paramagnetic groundstate arises as a function of doping in models of itinerant ferromagnets@xcite .    for completeness",
    ", class c stripes are defined as those arising not from phase separation but from long - range modulated afm order ( domain wall stripes ) .",
    "such stripes have been described in detail@xcite , and will not be further considered here .    in the next section ,",
    "we show that class b ( magnetic ) charge stripes can arise in a mean - field hubbard model@xcite , with the charged stripes displaying either ferromagnetic ( fm ) or linear antiferromagnetic ( laf ) ( ordering vector @xmath77 ) order .",
    "the laf stripes are very similar to white - scalapino stripes@xcite . the fm phase is stabilized by vhs nesting",
    ". this fm phase may be present in ruthenates@xcite , but is unlikely to be relevant for the cuprates ( for one thing , the fm stripes are likely to be diagonal , and do not form apbs@xcite , contrary to experiment ) .",
    "we have suggested that other vhs - stabilized phases are more likely@xcite ( see also ref .  ) , and here we explore the properties of a class a cdw phase@xcite . at a doping @xmath78 ,",
    "the effects of correlations are relatively weak , renormalizing the bandwidth by a factor of @xmath632 .",
    "thus for the present calculations on paramagnetic stripes , it will be assumed that renormalized parameters are used , and other effects of strong correlations will be neglected .    while laf stripes are most stable when @xmath65 , we explore the possibility that they can be stabilized even when @xmath71 by on - stripe cdw or superconducting order .",
    "ordinarily , the cdw phase is believed to _ compete _ with strong correlation effects , but we find ( section v.b ) that an unusual form of cdw phase can _ coexist _ with laf order : the charge density varies between zero and one ( not two ) holes per atom .      in a stripe array ,",
    "the alternating stripes are associated with the two stable thermodynamic phases . here ,",
    "we summarize the different ways these stripes are denoted in this paper .",
    "the stripe with lower hole doping is variously referred to as ` insulating ' or ` antiferromagnetic ' ( afm ) .",
    "( these are also known as magnetic stripes , since the charged stripes have considerably weaker magnetic order , but we will avoid that notation here . ) the stripe with higher hole doping is generically referred to as ` charged ' or ` hole - doped ' . at low temperatures ,",
    "these stripes are also ` superconducting ' , but at high temperatures , they are stabilized by some ` hidden order ' , and one purpose of this paper is to explore a number of possible orders .",
    "the orders fall into two groups : ` magnetic charged ' ( class b ) stripes could have fm or laf order ( the latter are white - scalapino - like stripes ) , while ` paramagnetic ' ( class a ) stripes could have cdw or flux - phase order .",
    "strong coupling models would seem to be natural for producing phase separated or striped ground states .",
    "any magnetic ordering avoids double occupancy , while changing from one form of magnetic order to another , via , e.g. , doping , requires highly collective spin rotations , as competing orders are orthogonal .",
    "while superexchange leads to antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulators at half filling , doping tends to favor textures with parallel spins ( e.g. , ferromagnetic ( fm ) ) to maximize hole hopping .",
    "such ferron phases were introduced long before high @xmath21@xcite , but it remains controversial whether such states are ground states of the hubbard model@xcite . while the tj model does have phase separation for large @xmath79 , it is unclear whether such phases extend to the values @xmath80 expected for the cuprates@xcite .",
    "we have found phase separated solutions of the hubbard model at mean - field level@xcite . while these solutions are metastable in uhf calculations , they closely resemble the ws stripes , and provide an interesting example of phase - separation mediated stripe phases .",

    "we showed that strong correlation effects could lead to charged stripes with a residual magnetic order , introduced a simple model for white - scalapino - like stripes , and found novel superconducting and cdw instabilities associated with such stripes .",
    "we illustrated how stripe order would affect arpes spectra , both dispersions and fermi surface maps .",
    "future studies will apply the model to describing other properties of the cuprates .",
    "certain anomalous features of strong - correlation calculations may find an explanation in underlying phase separation .",
    "thus , the vanishing of the renormalized hopping parameter @xmath155 near half filling in slave boson calculations may reflect the vanishing of the charged stripes at half filling@xcite , while the frequently - observed pinning of the vhs near the fermi level@xcite is consistent with vhs - stabilized charged stripes .",
    "finally , the idea of a commensurability effect near 1/8 doping , leading to a coexistence of _ domains _ for @xmath49 , provides a simple explanation for a large variety of experimental findings , including the saturation of the yamada plot , the direct observation of domains in stm studies , and a variety of microwave anomalies .",
    "this may also lead to a resolution of the combined puzzle of magnetic neutron scattering incommensurability and the neutron resonance peak .",
    "a stripe model provides a natural explanation of the incommensurability for @xmath48 , including a stripe reorientation transition at the metal - superconductor transition near @xmath223 .",
    "however , a band picture@xcite ( with @xmath224 close to a vhs ) provides a superior model for the combined , frequency - dependent incommensurability _ cum _ resonance peak found near optimal doping in ybco and bi2212 .",
    "an eps crossover from stripes to domains near @xmath225 would provide a natural explanation of these phenomena .",
    "interestingly , the only calculation@xcite to approximately describe the doping dependence is based on a slave boson model , which as noted above tends to mimic eps behavior as @xmath207 .",

    "<S> an electronic phase separation model provides a natural explanation for a large variety of experimental results in the cuprates , including evidence for both stripes and larger domains , and a termination of the phase separation in the slightly overdoped regime , when the average hole density equals that on the charged stripes . </S>",
    "<S> several models are presented for charged stripes , showing how density waves , superconductivity , and strong correlations compete with quantum size effects ( qses ) in narrow stripes . </S>",
    "<S> the energy bands associated with the charged stripes develop in the middle of the mott gap , and the splitting of these bands can be understood by considering the qse on a single ladder . </S>"
