    "the main goal of this section will be to illustrate to the reader how we are able to express the transfer function as a taylor  series expansion , which , eventually will lead us to another problem in finding a standard formula on how to relate the coefficients @xmath123 to the aberration coefficients @xmath124 , a problem which is solved using a combinatorial approach .",
    "also , we will continue to use only one spatial dimension as in sec .",
    "[ 1dsect ] in order to keep all mathematical manipulations simple .",
    "we begin by re  stating the transfer function in one spatial dimension    @xmath129    we remind the reader that the set of complex numbers @xmath130 are labelled here as `` aberration coefficients '' whose object is to characterise a particular state of the linear imaging system .",
    "each such coefficient is denoted    @xmath131    where @xmath132 denotes the real part and @xmath133 denotes the imaginary part .",
    "it was assumed in paganin and gureyev @xcite that at the fourier ",
    "space origin the transfer function must equal unity , that is @xmath134 .",
    "such an assumption implies a trivial loss of generality for all systems that posses a transfer function that does not vanish at the fourier space origin . also under this assumption",
    "we may set @xmath135 .",
    "now , we want to represent eq .   as a taylor ",
    "series , something that in paganin and gureyev @xcite was only stated but not shown . here",
    ", we provide a more detailed explanation of how this is achieved .",
    "firstly , let the entire sum in eq .",
    "be labelled @xmath136 .",
    "the taylor  series of an exponential function is given by    @xmath137    where , @xmath138 is also a non  negative integer @xmath139 .",
    "if we now substitute @xmath136 then eq .   becomes    @xmath140    notice how now we have commenced the summation from @xmath84 .",
    "this is due to assumption made earlier that @xmath134 which in turn allowed to set @xmath135 .",
    "writing the summation @xmath141 explicitly we get    @xmath142    we now turn our focus to the summation in eq .  .",
    "if one writes down the first few @xmath138 terms , say @xmath143 , it can be seen that all the common powers of @xmath144 can be collected .",
    "for example :    @xmath145    once we collect all the common powers of @xmath144 we see that the entire summation in eq .   can be expressed in the alternative form    @xmath146",
    "these mathematical manipulations reveal that we are able to represent the transfer function as the following taylor  series .",
    "@xmath147    we have re  labelled the non  negative integer @xmath138 with @xmath13 in order to remain consistent with our original notation . also , notice that each @xmath123 term is composed of a finite series of @xmath124 terms where the higher the order of @xmath13 the higher number the of terms that will appear .",
    "the fact that the series are finite turns out to be advantageous . on this note",
    "we see that another problem arises , that is , if one is dealing with aberrations that are higher in order than say @xmath148 , we saw from the above examples that computing all its terms in the series this can be tedious .",
    "this motivates us to seek a standard series formula which can allow us to calculate any @xmath123 for this problem by simply substituting fixed parameters to avoid such lengthy and tedious computations .",
    "this can be achieved if one visualises the problem as a combinatorial one .",
    "the first indication that tells us that this is solved combinatorially is when the term @xmath149 arises where we see that this is none other than a multinomial expansion which reveals its combinatorial nature . from this",
    "we can deduce that the terms in the series will have coefficients which can be calculated with the multinomial coefficients formula    @xmath150    notice that for any @xmath123 we find that the sum of the exponent times its subscript in each of its corresponding @xmath151 terms will always be equal . for instance take @xmath152 ; each of its @xmath151 terms in the expansion can be written as @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "now notice how the sum of the product of the exponents times its subscript for each term all equate to 3 , we have @xmath153 ( @xmath156 ) , @xmath154 ( @xmath157 ) and @xmath153 ( @xmath158 ) . if we do this for any @xmath123 this condition will still hold .",
    "now our next step is to try to decode a particular pattern for any @xmath123 series .",
    "let s focus on @xmath159 .",
    "here we see that the highest power is @xmath160 and therefore one can also deduce that the highest power for any @xmath151 is never greater than @xmath13 . we know that each expansion has a combinatorial nature so let s consider the terms that compose @xmath161 are elements from the set @xmath162 and its corresponding exponents are combinations from the set @xmath163 .",
    "we also see that the coefficients will be given by the multinomial coefficients formula . if we write down all possible combinations with their corresponding coefficients it displays as    @xmath164    as a convenient notation , notice that the sum of the product of the exponents times their corresponding subscripts",
    "have been deliberately placed above each combinatorial term .",
    "this helps us to see that if we only allow the terms in which the product of the exponents times their corresponding subscripts equals the order of the coefficient @xmath123 , in this case @xmath165 and neglect those which do not fulfill this condition then the surviving terms in the expansion will be the following    @xmath166    notice how applying this fusion of combinatorics and pattern decoding has arrived at the same answer for the @xmath161 terms in eq .  .",
    "now , we can employ the same strategy for @xmath152 where now all the terms are elements from the set @xmath167 and its exponents are combinations from the set @xmath168 .",
    "writing down the possible combinations will give    @xmath169    like the case for @xmath161 , if we only consider the terms where the sum of the exponents times their corresponding subscript equal @xmath170 and neglect the rest then the only terms which survive are    @xmath171    by extending the above logic one is able deduce the following standard formula to compute any @xmath123 :    @xmath172    here , @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 . to verify this standard formula",
    ", we calculate another @xmath123 and see if we arrive at the same result to that obtained by collecting terms as done previously in eq .  .",
    "we do this by calculating @xmath176 where according to the set condition one only needs to consider the terms which satisfy@xmath177 .",
    "below we display all the relevant terms    @xmath178    the computation above is in agreement with calculating @xmath176 via the standard formula and the more lengthy method which involves collecting term of @xmath179 powers as was done in eq .  .",
    "to end this section we return to the case where the transfer function contains two spatial dimensions transverse to the imaging direction .",
    "for such cases the combinatorial analysis is more complex .",
    "nevertheless , using a similar strategy to the one used to formulate the standard formula for the one  dimensional case one is also able to deduce a formula for the more common imaging scenario with two spatial dimensions .",
    "setting @xmath180 yield a `` two spatial dimensions standard formula '' of the form    @xmath181    where @xmath182 , @xmath183 @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "since we have set @xmath180 we must impose the condition that when @xmath186 then @xmath187 and vice versa .",
    "it is possible to make further simplification of the formula if rotational symmetry is also assumed ( i.e. @xmath188 ) .",
    "in this work we have treated the problem of aberrations for partially coherent complex scalar wave  fields imaged by optical systems characterized by a transfer function which is both linear and shift  invariant .",
    "we have derived expressions for the output cross ",
    "spectral density @xmath24 using only one spatial variable , for members of the ensemble that satisfy the  phase object approximation \" , the",
    "phase object approximation \" , the  weak phase  amplitude approximation \" and finally the  single ",
    "material weak phase  amplitude approximation \" , for certain classes of specimens .",
    "also , for the three classes of samples mentioned , an expression for the spectral density @xmath120 was calculated in which we saw how under certain restrictions the equations reduced to those derived in paganin and gureyev @xcite where partial coherence is not considered . for the single material case the idea of `` phase retrieval '' was mentioned , however in the context of partial coherence this was rather redundant but nonetheless gave rise to the idea of carrying out morphological studies of imaged samples partially coherent light and aberrated imaging systems .",
    "this idea may have several applications in many areas such as geology , microbiology , material science , etc .",
    "the transfer function was studied where we emphasized how one obtains the coefficients of taylor  series representation of the transfer function .",
    "this lead to a different problem involved finding a standard formula which can allow the calculation of any coefficient @xmath123 in terms of its corresponding aberration coefficients @xmath189 for an infinite number of aberration orders .",
    "this standard formula brings many advantages not only in the sense that it is not limited to a finite order of aberrations but also allows for broader considerations in  aberration balancing \" .",
    "aberration balancing is the act of seeking certain conditions in which the aberrations present in an optical system are negated by the system itself . to be more concise ,",
    "one seeks to balance out the aberrations in an optical system against one another .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the notion of scherzer defocus , where defocus is tuned to balance out spherical aberration @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the spectral density in eq .",
    "for the  weak  phase object approximation \" case .",
    "suppose one aimed to find the conditions for which all aberrations present balanced out one another such that the output image displayed only first order differential contrast , that is ,"
