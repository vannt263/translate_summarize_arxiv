    "the reduction in length scales brought about by `` lab - on - a - chip '' applications has raised a number of challenging questions .",
    "one is how to engineer devices for manipulating fluids at the micro- and nanometer length scales .",
    "the behaviour of fluids at the micron scale and below is determined mainly by viscous and surface forces , with inertia and gravity playing a negligible role . as a consequence",
    ", the structure and properties of the confining surfaces may be exploited to efficiently manipulate the behaviour of fluids which are in contact with them .",
    "recent progress in controlled fabrication of patterned solid surfaces at the nano- to micro - meter range @xcite open excellent prospects in tailoring interfacial forces which in turn can be used to control the behaviour of adsorbed fluids . apart from an academic interest ,",
    "a fundamental understanding of such systems will pave the way for the design and manufacturing of novel materials , devices , and applications .",
    "examples include smart surfaces with self - cleaning @xcite , enhanced heat transfer @xcite , reduced fluid drag @xcite or photo - responsive properties @xcite ; template - directed assembly of colloidal particles @xcite ; microfluidics @xcite and optofluidics @xcite .    from the viewpoint of optical applications liquid crystals ( lcs ) ,",
    "due to their unique optical properties @xcite , continue to play a major role in the display industry @xcite .",
    "in addition , lcs are the most representative class of room temperature ordered fluids .",
    "as such they provide an ideal testing ground for fundamental theories of order - disorder transitions and the role of topological defects , which are of crucial importance in all areas of physics as well as in many branches of materials science .",
    "one of the most notable features of lcs is their ability to generate complex profiles of the director field at the mesoscopic level in the presence of surfaces .",
    "the surface structure , e.  g. topographical or chemical patterns , may cause frustration in the lc molecular orientation field , leading to the emergence of topological defects , which in turn may affect the nematic ordering at the surface .",
    "this provides a tunable mechanism for designing switchable surfaces for lc displays since the behaviour of defects , as the surface response to the presence of the liquid crystal , may be tuned by temperature and surface topography or chemistry .",
    "nematic configurations induced by a single substrate patterned with stripes of mixed perpendicular and parallel anchoring properties have been studied theoretically in refs .",
    "@xcite and experimentally in refs .",
    "theoretical analysis predicted the existence of both orientationally uniform and non - uniform nematic textures in a semi - infinite geometry depending on the pattern geometry and anchoring strengths . when the nematic lc is confined between two substrates , with one micro - patterned , it is possible to create non - uniform lc textures in the cell @xcite . such micro - textures consist of alternating uniform and hybrid aligned nematic configurations ( planar at one and perpendicular at the other substrate ) and are used as low cost , easy - to - fabricate lc diffraction gratings @xcite  optical devices operating in a transmission mode .",
    "similar effects may be achieved by using an array of interdigitated electrodes beneath one of the confining substrates @xcite .    in all the work mentioned above , the lc was confined in cells bounded by solid substrates .",
    "additional exciting opportunities emerge when fluid - fluid interfaces are used as active optical surfaces , e.  g. by replacing one of the confining solid substrates .",
    "this adds a high degree of functional adaptability to optical devices as in the case of tunable - focus liquid lenses @xcite , electrowetting displays @xcite , or responsive diffraction gratings @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite dielectrophoresis induced interfacial modulations of a free oil interface has been reported .",
    "a micron - sized oil film was deposited on a planar substrate patterned with an interdigitated array of electrodes .",
    "the oil - air interfacial deformations were achieved with the application of a voltage @xmath0 difference between adjacent electrodes .",
    "the peak - to - peak amplitude @xmath1 of the interfacial deformations was found to behave @xmath2 , and relatively high voltages @xmath3 v were needed to obtain @xmath1 on the order of the micrometer , for average film thicknesses @xmath4 m .",
    "here we demonstrate that similar effects may be observed , in the absence of external fields , when instead of isotropic liquids orientationally ordered nematic lcs are used as the wetting fluid .",
    "when a thin film of lc is spread over a chemically patterned surface , the interfacial deformations emerge spontaneously as a result of the interplay between the lc elasticity and capillarity .",
    "in the following we investigate the modulation of nematic wetting films adsorbed on substrates decorated with stripes of alternating perpendicular and tangential anchoring properties ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "the main objective is to relate the morphology of the nematic - air interface to the average film thickness and the symmetry of the substrate pattern . in the next section",
    "we introduce a simple , `` exactly solvable '' effective interfacial model , which predicts a simple scaling behaviour of the interfacial deformations .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : ldg_model ] we compare the analytical predictions of the interfacial model with the numerical results of a model which fully accounts for the nematic degrees of freedom .",

    "it is a challenging task to determine the nematic director field for a domain with a `` moving '' boundary , which requires lengthy numerical calculations . in order to gain insight into the behaviour of the system , we start by constructing an effective interfacial model which depends on a @xmath17 ( the system is translationally invariant in the @xmath10-direction ) interfacial field @xmath15 and where the `` bulk '' degrees of freedom @xmath13 are `` integrated out '' . in the effective model",
