    "the study of comets with _ jwst _ will address current key decadal questions in planetary science , as well as astronomy and astrophysics , that are challenging to address with ground - based observations alone .",
    "these questions pertain to the initial stages of solar system formation and its subsequent evolution , and include : `` what were the initial stages , conditions , and processes of solar system formation and the nature of the interstellar matter that was incorporated ? ''",
    "`` what were the primordial sources of organic matter , and where does organic synthesis continue today ? '' `` how have the myriad chemical and physical processes that shaped the solar system operated , interacted , and evolved over time ? ''",

    ", we highlight some of the observational challenges , experimental techniques , and representative science opportunities that _ jwst _ offers as a tool to improve our knowledge of comets .",
    "such a space - based platform has easy access to key cometary emission bands from h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 , co , and ch@xmath5 that would otherwise be hindered by severe telluric absorption . except for co@xmath0",
    ", studies of these latter molecules are possible from ground - based telescopes , e.g. , through photodissociation products ( e.g. , oh and o from h@xmath0o , o from co@xmath0 ) , through non - resonance emissions ( e.g. , water hot - bands ) that are not blocked by the earth s atmosphere , or individual rovibrational lines doppler - shifted from their terrestrial counterparts ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    ". however , having direct access to the fundamental bands , and without doppler shift restrictions , can enable new and exciting results .",
    "above the atmosphere , background emission is greatly reduced , allowing for greater sensitivity to the 3- region and beyond , enabling survey studies of dust emission , water ice absorption , or ( refractory ) organic features that might otherwise take years to achieve from ground - based telescopes .",
    "time - domain _ jwst _ observational campaigns covering a wide range of heliocentric distances become possible for many more targets , rather than just the occasional hale - bopp - class comet .    in section",
    "[ sec : brightness ] , we present our methods to estimate the continuum arising from dust ( reflected and thermal emission ) , and to estimate the strengths of emission bands from molecules .",
    "these methods are used to determine integration times and signal - to - noise ratios throughout our paper .",
    "we then propose four science examples that _ jwst _ will be especially suited to address . in section  [ sec : gas - coma ] , we discuss the telescope s ability to measure the primary drivers of comet activity : h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 , and co. in section  [ sec : dust ] , we summarize simultaneous observations of water gas and dust comae and how they can be used to assess nucleus heterogeneity . in section  [ sec : ice ] , we propose observations that can address the nature of ice in cometary comae and nuclei . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : faint ] , we demonstrate how _ jwst _ can be used to detect gas in main belt and other faint comets .",
    "the effects of the observatory s non - sidereal tracking limit on observations of comets , and specific comet observing opportunities are summarized in section  [ sec : targets ] .",
    "at _ jwst _ wavelengths ( @xmath6  ) , comet spectra are generally dominated by sunlight scattered by and thermal emission from coma dust .",
    "it is a challenge for observers to accurately predict the surface brightness of a given target , due to each comet s inherent variability and coma physical properties ( dust and gas ejection speeds , grain parameters , presence of ice , etc . ) . for comets in the inner solar system , the observed energy from dust thermal emission and that from light scattered by dust are approximately equal in the 24   range , thus a single planck function or stellar template are poor approximations . whether the goal is to observe the continuum from dust , absorption or emissivity features , or gas emission , having a simple model to estimate",
    "continuum brightness is beneficial to observers interested in this wavelength regime .",
    "light scattered by comet dust can be estimated using the @xmath7 parameter of @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 is the product of the albedo , @xmath8 , the dust filling factor , @xmath9 , and the radius of the circular aperture in consideration , @xmath10 . under certain assumptions and conditions ,",
    "it is proportional to the dust production rate @xcite .",
    "it carries the units of @xmath10 , and is typically expressed in cm , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the observer - comet distance ( cm ) , @xmath13 is the heliocentric distance of the comet ( au ) , @xmath14 is the observed flux density of the comet within a circular aperture ( w  m@xmath15  @xmath2 ) , @xmath10 is the radius of the aperture projected to the distance of the comet ( cm ) , and @xmath16 is the flux density of sunlight ( w  m@xmath15  @xmath2au@xmath15 ) . we have written the albedo as @xmath17 to emphasize that the observed albedo is a function of phase angle ( sun - comet - observer angle , @xmath18 ) . for observations corrected to a phase angle of 0 , we will simply write @xmath7 .",

    ", @xcite introduced the parameter @xmath22 , which is the thermal emission equivalent to @xmath7 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the apparent emissivity , @xmath14 is now the observed thermal emission from dust ( w  m@xmath15  @xmath2 ) , and @xmath25 is the planck function evaluated at temperature @xmath26 ( w  m@xmath15  @xmath2 , and k , respectively ) .",
    "similar to @xmath7 , this quantity carries units of length , determined by the units of @xmath10 .",

    "the filling factors for @xmath7 and @xmath22 are not necessarily the same , as different populations of dust could dominate the measured scattered and thermal emission . in table",

    "[ fig : sw3 ] , we plot a near - ir spectrum of comet 73p - c / schwassmann - wachmann  3 @xcite , and our proposed model with the parameters @xmath39 , @xmath7=1400  cm , and @xmath40 .",
    "the agreement is acceptable for first - order integration time estimations .",
    "further refinements , e.g. , wavelength dependent @xmath7 to account for coma color , or wavelength dependent @xmath22 to account for grain composition and size distribution , are not necessary .",
    "in addition to the dust continuum , gas emission bands are commonly observed .",
    "here , we summarize our method to estimate total band flux . using fluorescence @xmath41-factors ( photons  s@xmath2  molecule@xmath2 at 1  au ) from @xcite",
    ", we generate total band fluxes in a 04 radius aperture , for either the nirspec integral field unit or micro - shutter assembly , assuming an optically thin coma ( table  [ tab : gas - flux ] ) , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the production rate of the molecule ( molecules  s@xmath2 ) , @xmath10 is is the radius of the aperture projected to the distance of the comet , @xmath44 is the planck constant , @xmath45 is the speed of light , @xmath46 is the band central wavelength , @xmath47  m  s@xmath2 is the expansion speed of the gas , @xmath12 is the observer - comet distance , and @xmath13 is the heliocentric distance of the comet ( au ) .",
    "all parameters have mks units , unless otherwise noted .",
    "although we assume an optically thin coma , optical depth effects must be carefully considered when interpreting real spectra . for comet 9p / tempel  1 , @xcite showed that optical depth effects are significant inside of @xmath3810  km for a water production rate of @xmath48  molecules  s@xmath2 and a co@xmath0 production rate of @xmath49  molecules  s@xmath2 at 1.5 au from the sun .",
    "for integration time estimation purposes , we neglect line opacity effects , which should only affect total band fluxes at the 10% level or less ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a _ jwst _ exposure time calculator could provide a two - component model that would be adaptable to a variety of solar system sources .",
    "continuum spectra of comet comae , comet nuclei , and asteroids can all be approximated by : ( 1 ) @xmath50 , based on a solar - type spectrum , potentially reddened , representing the reflected or scattered light ; and ( 2 ) @xmath51 , a blackbody spectrum of arbitrary temperature , representing the thermal emission , @xmath52 f_{\\lambda , therm } & = c_{therm } \\frac{b_\\lambda(t,\\lambda)}{b_\\lambda(t,\\lambda_{therm,0})}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the reflected ( or scattered ) and thermal emission normalization factors ; @xmath16 is the solar flux density ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the template spectra are normalized to 1.0 at reference wavelengths @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "because @xmath7 and @xmath22 can change with wavelength , their values and the normalization wavelengths should be carefully chosen for the observation in consideration .",
    "for example , one might choose @xmath58   and @xmath59   for the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : sw3 ] . the normalization factors for a comet coma model",

    "observers will need to estimate @xmath7 and @xmath22 based on the literature , their own experience , or recent observations .",
    "three gas species , h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 , and co , are primarily responsible for driving cometary activity .",
    "these molecules have very different levels of volatility ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that each species should dominate the comet s activity at different parts of the orbit , delineated by the abundance of each ice , and the amount of solar energy available for sublimating those ices .",
    "co may be released at heliocentric distances out to tens of au , while co@xmath0 sublimation dramatically increases around 68 au and h@xmath0o sublimation near 23 au .",
    "however , the limited observations available for these species indicate that cometary behavior is more complex than would otherwise be suggested by a simple energy balance model .",
    "the relative abundances not only differ from comet to comet , but also in unexpected ways with respect to heliocentric distance and sometimes before and after perihelion in a single comet @xcite .",
    "these variations are due presumably to inherent compositional differences between objects reflecting their origins in the early solar system , heterogeneities in individual nuclei , and evolutionary processing from insolation .    comprehensive data sets , i.e. , those covering the production of all three molecules ( h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 , and co ) over a wide range of times or heliocentric distances , typically depend on observations from multiple instruments and techniques .",
    "how systematic uncertainties ( instrumental , observational , or theoretical ) affect the relative abundances is therefore of concern . in addition , co@xmath0 can not be observed from the ground , thus little is known regarding its abundance in comets or its role in comet activity outside of recent snapshot surveys @xcite and missions to comets @xcite .",
    "the wavelength coverage and sensitivities of nirspec , nircam , and niriss will allow _ jwst _ to simultaneously or contemporaneously measure all three of the primary species over a range of heliocentric distances .",
    "such measurements enable studies of activity and composition at various distances and points around a comet s orbit , providing a uniform dataset that can not be achieved by other means .",
    "the high - spatial - resolution imaging available with nircam and niriss will also allow the investigation of heterogeneities in these species , revealed in the spatial distribution of the gases around the nucleus and their variations with time .    here",
    ", we demonstrate the capabilities of time - domain spectroscopy with nirspec .",
    "our goal is to observe h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 , and co in a single comet over a wide range of heliocentric distances .",
    "we take the orbit of c/2013 a1 ( siding spring ) as a baseline ( perihelion distance @xmath61  au ) to provide a rough idea for potential observing windows and comet brightnesses during an oort cloud comet s journey from 10  au pre - perihelion to 10  au post - perihelion .",
    "we assume a coma mixing ratio of 100/10/10 for h@xmath0o / co@xmath0/co at @xmath62  au , approximately equal to the average observation listed in @xcite . using the sublimation model of @xcite",

    "gas production rates are the product of the sublimation rate and the active area .",
    "water molecules have the shortest photodissociation length scale of the molecules in our study , but our apertures are no larger than 13% of this scale , so for simplicity , we neglect photodissociation . the continuum arising from dust , a source of noise , is modeled using eq .",

    "we have selected epochs that would be within _ jwst _ s solar elongation constraints ( 85 to 135 ) .",
    "the water production rate ( @xmath67  molecules  s@xmath2 ) and @xmath7 ( 925  cm ) at 1.5  au are within a factor of two of actual measurements of the comet near perihelion @xcite .",

    "dynamically new comets tend to have shallow lightcurves upon approach to perihelion @xcite , and we do not incorporate this aspect into our model .    using the prototype nirspec exposure time calculator , we compute the integration time required to achieve a peak signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of 10 for each band ( table  [ tab : gas - flux ] ) and plot it in fig .

    "thus , _ jwst _ will easily be the best telescope for spectroscopic studies of comet activity at moderate and large heliocentric distance .",
    "comet nuclei are aggregates of the planetesimals present in the outer solar system during the epoch of planet formation @xcite .",
    "there is an open question concerning the homogeneity of accreted planetesimals for particular comets , i.e. , are individual comets aggregates of a heterogeneous population of planetesimals formed over a range of times and distances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a close approach ( here , @xmath70",
    "au ) between a comet and _ jwst _ would allow us to observe coma features on @xmath71 km spatial scales , potentially revealing distinct active regions before they spatially mix in the coma .",
    "such a study can test the heterogeneity of comet nuclei by observing and comparing multiple spatially resolved coma jet features .",
    "_ jwst _ s miri instrument will be able to simultaneously observe both coma dust and water gas . at @xmath72  ,",

    "we use the terms grain and aggregate interchangeably .",
    "they represent an entire particle of dust , which may be composed of smaller sub - units ( the latter is implied for aggregate ) .",
    "typical dust features include a broad plateau from 8 to 12  , primarily arising from anhydrous amorphous silicates ( non - stochiometric olivine and pyroxene ) , and narrow emission peaks ( @xmath73 ) from crystalline silicates , dominated by mg - rich olivine @xcite .",
    "miri also covers the @xmath74 water gas emission band at 6  , observed and studied in several comets with the _ infrared space observatory _ and _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "in addition , the nirspec instrument holds the potential to simultaneously detect emission from water gas and hydrocarbons , the latter via the aromatic c  h stretch at @xmath383.3   and the aliphatic c  h stretch at @xmath383.4   ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "this comet was observed to be a point source by _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite at @xmath95  au ( pre - aphelion ) , with an effective nucleus radius of 5.7  km @xcite .",
    "we model the comet nucleus thermal emission with the near - earth asteroid thermal model of @xcite and the parameters of @xcite .",
    "the scattered light contribution is modeled assuming a geometric albedo of @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "our goal is to detect the presence of water ice on a surface .",
    "we choose the 3- water ice because of its high relative absorption compared to the other water ice bands in the near - infrared .",
    "the same methodology could be applied to the detection of surface organics , similar to those seen at comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko @xcite .",
    "there is , however , an important caveat : observations of a point source are not necessarily those of a bare nucleus , as a faint and/or unresolved coma may be present . supporting observations may be needed to rule out coma contamination in any particular data set .",
    "we target a water - ice band with a band depth of 10% or more at a confidence level of 5-@xmath97 .",

    "the authors report an @xmath21 of 1300 cm at 0.6   within a distance of 5000 km from the nucleus , which corresponds to a flux density of 50 and @xmath110  @xmath101jy at 0.6 and 3  , respectively , within an angular diameter of 04 .",
    "we conclude that in 900  s we can obtain a spectrum of comet ison with a snr of 100 using the current nirspec prototype exposure time calculator .",

    "s capabilities will transform our understanding of faint and/or weakly active comets by enabling observations that were heretofore at the limit of experimental techniques .",
    "such comets comprise several categories :    1 .",
    "main - belt comets ( mbcs ) .",
    "activity recurring from orbit to orbit has been identified in a handful of mbcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the mechanism for this activity is unknown . to date , there have been no successful searches for signatures of volatiles on mbcs .",
    "nearly inactive and dormant comets . a large number of suspected dead comets ( inactive objects in comet - like orbits ) have been identified in the asteroid population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and occasionally asteroids show cometary activity . for example , _ spitzer_/irac observations of `` asteroid '' ( 3552 ) don quixote exhibited signs of co@xmath0 outgassing @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are known comets with extremely weak or only sporadic activity , e.g. , 209p / linear  41 @xcite or 107p / wilson - harrington @xcite .",
    "high - sensitivity observations of volatiles can help confirm or better characterize their cometary natures .",
    "3 .   very small comets . the population of small near - sun comets are generally thought to be @xmath112  m in radius @xcite , too small or weakly active to be observed beyond the solar coronagraphs on soho or stereo .",
    "little is known about these small bodies , including what drives their activity : normal cometary activity via sublimation of ices or the sublimation of dust and refractory grains due to the extreme temperatures experienced near perihelion ( equilibrium temperatures exceeding 1000  k ; * ? ? ?",
    "distant comets .",
    "many comets show continuous activity outside the so - called water - ice line .",
    "their activities may be driven by the more volatile ices co@xmath0 or co @xcite , or by the exothermic annealing of water ice from amorphous to crystalline states @xcite .",
    "owing to their large distances , studies of activity are generally limited to observations of dust comae and tails .",
    "a common theme in the above cases is faint activity .",
    "nircam imaging would be capable of searching for signs of very weak activity ( coma and/or tail , both dust and gas ) and of efficiently characterizing nucleus properties such as size , elongation , albedo , and beaming parameter .",
    "nirspec might be able to spectroscopically detect the driving volatiles at production rates lower than previously achievable .",
    "the comet - asteroid transition is currently poorly understood , and such results , whether of severely processed sun - grazing / sun - skirting comets , dormant comets , distant comets , or of activated asteroids , would yield insight into the ongoing evolutionary processes of our solar system .    to demonstrate _ jwst _",
    "s capabilities for characterizing activity in faint comets , we consider observations of main belt comet p/2010 r2 ( la sagra ) in late aug 2021 ( @xmath113  au , @xmath114  au ) .",
    "this observing window is post - perihelion , during a period when comet la sagra has been observed to be active with an @xmath7 near 50  cm @xcite .",
    "estimates of the dust production rate by @xcite and @xcite span from 0.1 to 4  kg  s@xmath2 . assuming",
    "a dust to gas mass production ratio of 1:1 , and assuming water sublimation is driving the activity , this corresponds to a water production rate with an order of magnitude of @xmath115  molecules  s@xmath2 .",
    "for this exercise , we use nirspec to detect the @xmath116 water band at 2.7  , one of the strongest water bands in comets @xcite and one that can not be observed from the ground @xcite . in a small aperture of radius 02 , the estimated continuum flux density at 2.7   is @xmath117  w  m@xmath15  @xmath2 , and the water band flux is @xmath118  w  m@xmath15 . with the nirspec prototype exposure time calculator and the @xmath93 prism , we model the water band as a single 0.2 - -wide line . in a 1  hr exposure ,",
    "the peak of the line is detected above the continuum with a signal - to - noise ratio of 4 .",
    "thus , we can expect _ jwst _ to provide one of the best tests for the drivers of main - belt comet activity .",
    "_ jwst _ is expected to have the ability to track moving targets with proper motions @xmath119108  hr@xmath2 ( 30 mas  s@xmath2 ) @xcite . to estimate the impact this limit may have on cometary science",
    ", we searched the nasa jet propulsion laboratory solar system dynamics group database for all comets that reached perihelion during the five - year period 2010 jan 1 to 2015 jan 1 .",
    "this list includes 393 comets : 221 short - period comets ( with numbered or provisional `` p/ '' designations ) , and 172 oort cloud and long - period comets ( with provisional `` c/ '' designations ) . for each target",
    ", we used the iau minor planet center s ephemeris service to generate ephemerides with 3-day intervals , using the center of the earth as the observer .",
    "the differences in ephemerides between the earth and _ jwst _ at the l2 lagrange point ( 1.5@xmath8610@xmath120  km or 0.01  au away ) are not significant for this exercise .",
    "the proper motions of all targets within _ jwst _ s solar elongation constraints ( 85135 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : proper ] .",
    "not all of the observing windows make sense in a real world situation , e.g. , the plot includes epochs before some comets are discovered , and all epochs are shown independent of the comet s apparent brightness .",
    "however , we neglect these and other considerations and focus on the orbital characteristics of the known comet population .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : proper - hist ] , we show histograms of our comet ephemerides binned by heliocentric distance .",
    "oort cloud and long - period comets have higher proper motions in the inner solar system than short - period comets , due to their higher eccentricities and the greater potential for high inclinations , including retrograde orbits .",
    "these faster moving comets are , therefore , more likely to exceed a proper motion of 108  hr@xmath2 .",
    "less than 50% of the opportunities to observe oort cloud or long - period comets inside of 1.7  au are possible , given the current anticipated tracking limit .",
    "inside of 1.3 au from the sun , there is a @xmath12125% probability that any particular comet could be observed .",
    "this limitation can significantly affect science programs requiring the maximum possible spatial resolution in studies of nearby comets .",
    "any observations dedicated to the near - nucleus environment will have a limited set of objects to consider , if any .",
    "if we artificially increase the non - sidereal tracking rate by a factor of 2 to 216  hr@xmath2 , the situation is substantially improved : the 50% limit for oort cloud / long - period comets is reduced to @xmath122  au and most comets can be observed down to 1.1  au from the sun .    in table",
    "[ tab : comets ] we present a select list of targets observable by _ jwst _ , based on : ( 1 ) comets with perihelion dates during the first 5 years of the observatory s mission , ( 2 ) centaurs with known or suspected cometary activity , ( 3 ) prior and potential spacecraft targets , and ( 4 ) known main - belt comets and activated asteroids .",
    "our choice of jupiter - family comets is biased towards previous or potential spacecraft targets , and targets with favorable observing circumstances ( small comet - observer distance , or otherwise easily observable at perihelion ) .",
    "this list of comets , as well as undiscovered comets ( especially oort cloud and long - period comets ) , comets near aphelion , and unanticipated outbursts and fragmentation events will provide many targets of opportunity for _ jwst _ observers .",
    "we considered simple tools for estimating comet dust and gas brightness based on known comet properties .",
    "we then explored four science themes that _ jwst _ will be especially suited to address : ( 1 ) for a moderately bright comet , we can expect studies of the main drivers of cometary activity , h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 , and co , out to a heliocentric distance of at least 4  au ; co@xmath0 can be observed even farther , out to at least 7  au .",
    "( 2 ) we assessed the observatory s potential to detect ice and organics in the comet population .",
    "a survey of surface ice in centaurs appears feasible for objects as small as 12  km out to 19  au from the sun .",
    "spectroscopy of jupiter - family comets , targeted near aphelion during periods of inactivity , can be used to determine ice deposition rates ( if occurring ) , and further understand the uniqueness of the recent discovery of organics on the surface of comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko .",
    "the properties of water ice grains can be measured , and spatially resolved throughout the coma of a moderately bright comet at 4  au .",
    "such a study would provide observational constraints on the lifetime of coma water ice , which can in turn be compared to their physical properties derived from light scattering .",
    "( 3 ) through the fundamental emission band of water at 2.7  , _ jwst _ will be able to provide direct tests of the cometary nature of main - belt comets .",
    "( 4 ) spatially resolved dust studies in the mid - ir can be used to examine the physical properties of the grains , and to test the heterogeneity of nuclei through their coma dust properties .",
    "finally , there will be many opportunities to observe comets during the first five - years of operations , but the proper motion limit significantly affects target availability within 1.7  au of the sun .",
    "improved tracking performance is highly desired to enhance the ability of the community to further studies of the near - nucleus environment of comets at the best - spatial resolutions possible .",
