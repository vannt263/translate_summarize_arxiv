    "reasons that synow spectra can not be expected to provide exact fits to observed spectra are numerous and obvious : the calculations are based on many simplifiying assumptions , including spherical symmetry , and the oscillator strengths ( kurucz 1993 ) are good but not perfect . in this paper",

    "figure  14 shows a closer view of the h@xmath11 region .    could the 6300    absorption in sne  2000h and 1999di be produced by c  ii 6580  rather than h@xmath4 ?",
    "we think not .",
    "it would be surprising to see a deep c  ii 6580 absorption in sne  ib , when even in sne  ic this line never forms a deep absorption and , if present at all , is hard to identify .",

    "the top panel of figure  15 is like figure  13 except that only c  ii lines , detached at 13,000  , are used .",
    "although 6580 can account for the 6300    absorption as well as h@xmath4 does , and 7236 ,  7231 are not a problem because , being more detached than he  i , they fall near or within the strong feature produced by he  i 7065 , the absorption produced by c  ii 4738 ,  4745 is much too strong ( at least in lte at 7000  k ) .",

    "no , it can not .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  15 shows that undetached ne  i fails in two ways : ( 1 ) the absorption produced by @xmath326402 is too far to the blue , and ( 2 ) even though the synthetic absorption produced by @xmath326402 has not been made strong enough , other unwanted features already are present .    in view of these difficulties with c  ii and",
    "ne  i , and the apparent presence of h@xmath11 in the observed spectra , we consider the identification of hydrogen lines in sne  2000h and 1999di to be definite .",
    "sn  1954a appears to have been spectroscopically akin to sne  2000h and 1999di .",
    "mclaughlin ( 1963 ) and branch ( 1972 ) identified he  i lines in photographic spectra of sn  1954a obtained at the lick observatory and the mount wilson and palomar observatories , respectively .",
    "consequently sn  1954a usually has been regarded to have been a type  ib supernova , but on occasion doubts has been expressed about the classification because of the low quality of the photographic spectra compared to modern observations .",
    "figure  16 compares microphotometer tracings of the two earliest spectra of sn  1954a ( blaylock et  al .",
    "2000 ) , obtained on blue and red  sensitive emulsions 46 days after maximum light , with the @xmath30 day spectrum of sn  2000h .",
    "only this one spectrum of sn  1954 was obtained on a red  sensitive emulsion .",
    "the sn  1954a spectra are not actually relative flux but merely a measure of the transmission through the photographic plate .",
    "parts of the spectra were overexposed so the features are distorted ; in particular , emission peaks tend to be suppressed .",
    "the shapes of these spectra also are strongly influenced by the wavelength dependences of the emulsion sensitivities ; e.g. , neither emulsion is sensitive around 5200  and the sensitivity falls off steeply between 6500 and 7000   . nevertheless , some of the absorptions in sn  1954a can be located and they correspond well with the absorptions in sn  2000h , including the two attributed to h@xmath4 and h@xmath11 . branch ( 1972 ) considered the possibility of h@xmath4 and h@xmath11 absorptions in sn  1954a , blueshifted by 10,800  in the observer s frame ; the value of @xmath5 for the parent galaxy is now known to be 291  , so the hydrogen lines are blueshifted by about 11,000  in the supernova frame .",
    "branch also considered the possibility of ne  i lines in sn  1954a .",
    "this is perhaps still not ruled out , but given the apparent resemblance of sn  1954a to sne  2000h , we prefer the hydrogen identification .    in terms of apparent magnitude ,",
    "sn  1954a was the fourth brightest supernova of the twentieth century , surpassed only by the type  ii sn  1987a and the type  ia sne  1972e and 1937c ( barbon et  al .",
    "sn  1954a occurred in the star  bursting dwarf galaxy ngc  4214 , at a distance of only about 4  mpc ( leitherer et  al . 1996 ) , more than 10 times closer than sne  2000h and 1999di , so it is more amenable to studies of the environment in which it exploded .",
    "we note that van dyk , hamuy , & filippenko ( 1996 ) found sn  1954a to be unusual among sne  ib in that it was not near any visible h  ii region , and that a deep vla search for radio emission at the site of sn  1954a carried out by j.  cowan and d.  branch in may , 1986 , resulted in a three  sigma upper limit to the flux density at 20  cm of 0.068  mjy ( eck 1998 ) , which corresponds to a monochromatic luminosity of less than one twentieth of cas  a.      figure  17 compares a spectrum of sn  1984l obtained 9 days after maximum with a synthetic spectrum that has = 8000  and = 6500  k , and includes hydrogen lines detached at 15,000  .",
    "the fe  ii lines fit very well , and the fit to the other features is satisfactory . given the presence of h@xmath4 in sne  2000h , 1999di , and 1954a , we assume that the 6300    absorption is produced by h@xmath4 .",
    "however , because the h@xmath4 optical depth at the detachment velocity is only 0.6 , there is no support for this identification from h@xmath11 because it is too weak to see .",
    "( the oscillator strength of h@xmath11 is about one fifth that of h@xmath4 . )",
    "figure  18 compares the @xmath33 day spectrum of sn  1984l with the @xmath29 day spectrum of sn  2000h .",
    "the spectra are similar except that in sn  1984l the 6300    absorption is weaker and the 4560    absorption is not visible .",
    "this shows that while our assumption that the 6300    absorption in sn  1984l is produced by h@xmath4 is reasonable , it is not proven .",
    "it is conceivable that c  ii 6580 or ( more plausibly because it would nt need to be detached ) ne i @xmath326402 could be responsible for the 6300  absorption in sn  1984l and other typical sne  ib , and be overwhelmed by h@xmath4 only in events such as sne  2000h , 1999di , and 1954a .",
    "we proceed on the assumption that at early times the 6300    absorption is produced by h@xmath4 in all the sne  ib of our sample .    as an example of a comparison at a earlier time when",
    "is higher , figure  19 compares the earliest spectrum for which good wavelength coverage is available , the beijing spectrum of sn  1999dn 10 days before maximum , with a synthetic spectrum that has = 14,000  and = 6500  k. now hydrogen lines are detached at 18,000  , where the h@xmath4 optical depth is 1.3 .",

    "the fit to the fe  ii features is unusually poor , but this value of does give the best fit in the 4300 to 5300    region , and a significantly lower value would give a noticeably worse fit .",
    "( the narrow h@xmath4 emission from an h  ii region in the parent galaxy is very close to 6563   , which shows that the high required value of  is not due to the observed spectrum having been inadvertently overcorrected for parent galaxy redshift . )",
    "now we briefly consider the events of our sample for which the times of maximum light are unknown .",
    "the spectrum of sn  1996n indicates that it was discovered not long after maximum .",
    "because we use hydrogen lines in the synthetic spectrum for sn  1996n , the comparison with the observed spectrum is shown in figure  21 .",
    "helium lines are undetached and the optical depth of the reference line is 5 ; hydrogen lines are detached at 17,000  where the optical depth of h@xmath4 is 0.5 .",
    "overall , the fit is good .",
    "sne  1991ar and 1997dc do not appear to be unusual provided that they were discovered well after maximum light .",
    "as discussed by matheson et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the spectra of sn  1998 t are seriously contaminated by light from the parent galaxy ; taking this into consideration , sn  1998 t does not appear to be unusual provided that it was discovered about a week after maximum . as far as we can tell ,",
    "sne  1991ar , 1997dc , and 1998 t were typical sne  ib , but they were not observed early enough to check on the presence of h@xmath4 .",
    "the most important of the fitting parameters that have been used for the synthetic spectra are collected in table  2 .",
    "the spectra are listed in order of time with respect to maximum light so only the supernovae for which we have an estimate of the time of maximum light appear in the table .",
    "( the date 0703 , for example , refers to july  3 . )    for the six sne  ib for which we have estimates of the time of maximum light ,  is plotted against time in figure  22 .",
    "the tightness of the relationship is striking .",
    "sn  1998dt at 32 days after maximum seems to stand out ; otherwise , the scatter about the mean curve is about what should be expected from our nominal errors of 1000  in  and a few days in the dates of maximum light . for",
    "the simple case of constant opacity and a @xmath16 density distribution , the velocity at the photosphere would decrease with time as @xmath34 . the line in figure  22 , the best power ",
    "law fit to the data ( excluding sn  1998dt at 32 days ) , corresponds to @xmath35 . considering that the opacity is not really constant , that the actual density distribution does not really follow a single power law over a wide velocity range , and that the best power  law index for fitting the spectra is not well constrained , not much significance should be attched to the difference between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "our adopted values of  can be used to make rough estimates of the mass and kinetic energy above the photosphere . for spherical symmetry and a @xmath16 density distribution , the mass ( in @xmath37 ) and the kinetic energy ( in 10@xmath38 ergs ) above the electron  scattering optical depth @xmath39 are ( millard et  al .",
    "1999 )        where @xmath42 is  in units of 10,000  , @xmath43 is the time since explosion in days , @xmath44 is the mean molecular weight per free electron , and the integration is carried out to arbitrarily high velocity . if we assume that maximum light occurs 20 days after explosion , that @xmath36 , that @xmath45 ( e.g. , half  ionized helium or singly ionized oxygen ) , and that  is at @xmath46 , then at maximum light = 10,000  ( figure  22 ) gives @xmath47 and @xmath48 ergs . at 20 days after maximum , using = 7000  and keeping the other parameters the same gives @xmath49 and @xmath50 ergs . in reality , of course , the kinetic energy above the 7000  photosphere must be greater than that above the 10,000  photosphere .",
    "if we use @xmath51 instead of @xmath36 between 7000 and 10,000   then we obtain a total of @xmath52 and @xmath53 ergs above the 7000  photosphere .",
    "figure  22 provides some constraints on models of sne  ib .",
    "the hydrodynamics must account for the velocity at the photosphere as a function of time , and the ensemble of sn  ib progenitors must be consistent with the tightness of the relationship .",
    "the small scatter suggests that the masses and the kinetic energies of the sne  ib of our sample are similar , and it does not leave much room for the influence on  of departures from spherical symmetry .",
    "figure  23 shows the minimum velocities of the he  i lines ( squares when undetached and diamonds when detached ) .",
    "there appears to be a standard pattern ( again with the possible exception of sn  1998dt at 32 days ) . before and near the time of maximum",
    "the he  i lines tend to be undetached .",
    "after maximum the lines tend to be detached , but the detachment velocities tend to decrease with time , from about 10,000 to 7000  .",
    "this means that the fraction of helium in this velocity range that is in the lower levels of the optical he  i lines is increasing with time faster than @xmath54 .",
    "( the matter density is decreasing as @xmath55 by expansion but the sobolev optical depth also is proportional to @xmath56 because it is inversely proportional to the velocity gradient . )",
    "the increasing fraction of helium in the excited levels may be understandable in terms of the decreasing column depth between the nickel core and the helium layers , and the decreasing detachment velocity may mean that the fractional helium abundance is lower at lower velocities . in any case , some helium is present at least down to 7000  .",
    "our estimate above for the total mass above the 7000  photosphere was 1.1 to 1.5  m@xmath57 , which is a rough upper limit on the mass of helium above 7000  .",
    "there could be more helium below 7000  .",
    "figure  23 provides more constraints on models of sne  ib .",
    "the radial profile of the helium abundance , together with that of the @xmath1ni that is responsible for exciting it , should account for the he  i velocities and optical depths ( table  2 ) .",
    "figure  23 also shows the minimum velocities of the hydrogen lines ( circles ) , which always are detached . in the three events for which we are convinced of the hydrogen identifications",
    " sne  2000h , 1999dn , and 1954a  the minimum hydrogen velocity is between 11,000 and 13,000  . in the events in which we assume h@xmath4 to be present at early times  sne  1983n , 1984l , 1999dn , and 1996n ( the latter is not shown in figure  23 because the date of maximum light is unknown )  the detachment velocities tend to decrease with time but they are consistent with similar minimum velocities of the hydrogen . thus the available evidence is consistent with the proposition that sne  ib in general have hydrogen down to @xmath58  . [ for comparison , in the type  iib sn  1993j the characteristic velocity of the ejected hydrogen was about 9000  ( patat et  al . 1995 ; utrobin 1996 ; houck & fransson 1996 ) , and in the type  iib sn  1996cb it was about 10,000  ( deng et  al .",
    "a challenge for those who study the complicated evolution of massive stars in binary systems ( e.g. , podsiadlowski , joss , & hsu 1992 ; nomoto , iwamoto , & suzuki 1995 ; wellstein , langer , & braun 2001 ) is to understand why many or perhaps even all stellar explosions that develop strong he  i lines should eject at least a small amount of hydrogen .",
    "the hydrogen mass that is required to give an h@xmath4 optical depth of unity depends on the fraction of hydrogen that is in the balmer level . in lte , with an electron density of @xmath59  @xmath60 , the balmer fraction peaks around @xmath61 near 6000  k. in this case we estimate that a hydrogen mass on the order of @xmath62 would be required .",
    "non  lte calculations that take nonthermal excitation into account are needed for a more reliable estimate of the hydrogen mass .",
    "the optical depths of the helium lines , and especially the hydrogen lines , are not very high , even though the corresponding absorption features are distinct and fairly deep .",
    "this reflects a simple geometric aspect of supernova line formation : as explained in jeffery & branch ( 1990 ) , absorption features formed by detached lines are deeper than those formed by undetached lines .",
    "this point is illustrated in figure  24 , which shows that when hydrogen is detached from the photosphere by a factor of two and h@xmath4 has @xmath63 , its absorption feature is deeper than that of an undetached h@xmath4 that has @xmath64 .",
    "the h@xmath4 optical depths in our synthetic spectra for sne  2000h , 1999di , and 1954a are not high ,",
    "so if they were only mildly lower these events would look like typical sne  ib .",
    "similarly , moderately lower he  i line optical depths would transform a sn  ib into a sn  ic .",
    "figure  24 also illustrates how undetached hydrogen lines are more `` obvious '' than detached lines .",
    "first , undetached lines have conspicuous narrow , rounded emission peaks while detached lines have inconspicuous broad , flat peaks .",
    "note also that although the h@xmath4 absorption is deeper in the detached spectrum , the h@xmath11 absorption is deeper in the undetached spectrum .",
    "this is because in the undetached spectrum the optical depth at the photosphere of h@xmath11 is about 2 while in the detached spectrum the optical depth at the detachment velocity is only about 0.4 .",
    "an optical depth as low as 0.4 can produce only a shallow absorption , even when the line is detached .",
    "for these reasons , supernovae that have undetached hydrogen lines have obvious hydrogen lines and are classified as type  ii .",
    "supernovae that have detached hydrogen lines are classified as type  ib because the presence of hydrogen is not immediately obvious , even when the h@xmath4 absorption is as deep as it is in sne  2000h , 1999di , and 1954a .",
    "sne  iib are those that have undetached hydrogen lines when they are first observed . in some cases ,",
    "whether an event is classified as ib or iib may depend on how early the first spectrum is obtained .",
    "the implication of the previous paragraphs is that the spectroscopic differences between sne  iib , the sne  ib that have deep h@xmath4 absorptions , and typical sne  ib may be caused mainly by mild differences in the hydrogen mass . for a given kinetic energy , the lower the hydrogen mass the higher the minimum velocity of the ejected hydrogen .",
    "similarly , the spectroscopic differences between typical sne  ic and sne  ib could be caused mainly by moderate differences in the helium mass .",
    "for example , matheson et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) found higher blueshifts of the o  i @xmath327773 line in sne  ic than in sne  ib .",
    "for a given kinetic energy , the lower the helium mass the higher the minimum velocity of the ejected helium , and therefore the higher the velocity of the ejected oxygen .",
    "these suggestions are not original to this paper , but they are strengthened by our finding that the h  i and he  i optical depths in sne  ib are not very high .",
    "these suggestions also are not inconsistent with arguments , based on light curves , for the existence of different physical classes of hydrogen  poor events that cut across the conventional spectroscopic types ( e.g. , clocchiatti & wheeler 1997 ) .",
    "the number of sne  ib for which good spectral coverage is available is still relatively small .",
    "more events should be observed to explore the degree of the spectral homogeneity and to find out whether there is a continuum of hydrogen line strengths .",
    "also needed are detailed non  lte spectrum calculations for supernova models having radially stratified compositions ,  to determine the the hydrogen and helium masses and the distribution of the @xmath1ni that is required to excite the helium .",
    "the possibility that nonthermally excited ne  i can produce spectral features strong enough to be seen needs to be investigated .",
    "detailed non  lte calculations for parameterized sn  ib models , using the phoenix code ( e.g. , baron et  al .",
    "1999 ) , are underway .",
