    "observed non - thermal line widths in molecular clouds ( mcs ) , where all star formation in the galaxy takes place , point to the presence of supersonic turbulence in such regions ( falgarone & philips 1990 ) .",
    "the properties of the turbulent medium , such as mach number and magnetic field strength , may determine the products of the star formation process .",
    "as an important source of heating within molecular clouds ( stone et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter s98 ) , turbulent energy dissipation may also play a role .",
    "much effort has been directed toward numerically simulating turbulent media in order to better understand the link between turbulence and star formation ( see elmegreen & scalo 2004 , maclow & klessen 2004 , and mckee & ostriker 2007 and references therein ) .    as we have not yet identified the turbulent driving mechanism ,",
    "there remain many unanswered questions about the evolution of molecular clouds .",
    "is the turbulence periodically re - energized , or does it simply decay away ? how much impact do magnetic fields have on the properties of the turbulence ?",
    "crutcher ( 1999 ) , using observations of zeeman splitting , found magnetic fields in some clouds strong enough that one can not safely neglect their effects .",
    "although it has been shown that magnetic fields do not appreciably lengthen the turbulent decay time ( s98 ; mac low 1999 ) , they do create anisotropy within the clouds ( e.g.  vestuto et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter v03 ; esquivel et al .",
    "2003 ) , which may have important observational and evolutionary consequences .",
    "for example , molecular clouds are often observed to be filamentary ( e.g.  mizuno et al .",
    "1995 ; churchwell et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the energy dissipation properties of supersonic hydrodynamic and mhd turbulence with a variety of magnetic field strengths using athena , a new higher - order godunov code .",
    "an important goal of this study is to investigate the effect of the assumed driving mechanism on the properties of the resulting turbulence , such as power spectra and intermittency indicators .",
    "our analysis utilizes data from high - resolution numerical simulations with twenty - five different parameter sets . in recent years",
    ", a variety of results have been reported on the properties of supersonic mhd turbulence , including energetics ( e.g.  s98 ; mac low 1999 ; ostriker et al .",
    "2001 ) , power spectra ( e.g.  cho & lazarian 2003 , 2005 ; v03 ; padoan et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter p07 ) , and probability distribution functions ( e.g.  padoan et al .",
    "1997 ; passot & vazquez - semadeni 1998 ; ostriker et al .  2001 ; kowal et al .  2007 ;",
    "kritsuk et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter k07 ) .",
    "where possible , we identify differences in our methods and results as compared to those of other groups . in a separate letter ( lemaster & stone 2008 , hereafter paper i )",
    ", we have reported the results of an investigation of the variation of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of density with mach number .",
    "our primary result in that paper was that the intermittent behavior of turbulence could be responsible for the large cloud - to - cloud variation in the observed star formation rate per solar mass .",
    "the primary tool available to investigate the properties of highly nonlinear , supersonic mhd turbulence is direct numerical simulation . to date , most results have been computed using a few numerical algorithms , such as zeus ( e.g.  s98 ; v03 ; mac low 1999 ; ostriker et al .  1999 ; ostriker et al .",
    "2001 ) , the pencil code ( e.g.  haugen & brandenburg 2004 ) , the stagger code ( e.g.  p07 ) , and eno methods ( e.g.  cho & lazarian 2003 ) .",
    "there has been concern expressed in the literature that previous results may be strongly affected by numerical dissipation .",
    "thus , it is worth re - examining the problem with more accurate methods .",
    "this study represents one of the first applications of higher - order godunov methods to the study of supersonic mhd turbulence .    without knowing the driving mechanism , we are left with many possible methods of generating turbulence in simulations .",
    "the hope is that the choice of method for the simulated driving will have an insignificant effect on the results .",
    "federrath , klessen , & schmidt ( in prep . ) , however , have shown that compressive and solenoidal forcing produce dramatically different turbulent states .",
    "for some diagnostics , such as intermittency , the time - variability of the turbulent state is critical .",
    "even if an array of driving methods produce the same mean state , do the instantaneous states have the same distribution about the mean",
    "? we will investigate the dependence on driving scale of various diagnostics , given our particular driving method , which is very similar to that employed by , e.g. , s98 and v03 .    for power spectra of simulated turbulence to be valuable",
    ", the resolution needs to be high enough that the driving and numerical dissipation scales are well separated , allowing the inertial range to be studied .",
    "when magnetic fields are taken into account , simulating turbulence at these resolutions can be prohibitively expensive .",
    "another goal of this study is to investigate whether properties of the power spectra and other diagnostics are converged at the numerical resolutions feasible at the moment , up to @xmath0 .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : methods ] by describing our numerical methods in detail .",
    "we proceed , in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , to present our results . ",
    "[ sec : satresults ] includes a convergence study and mach number scaling study of saturation amplitudes ,  [ sec : specresults ] includes a power spectrum analysis ,  [ sec : sonicresults ] analyzes the sonic scale in @xmath0 runs , and  [ sec : mittresults ] considers time - variability and temperature intermittency in the turbulence .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in  [ sec : concl ] and discuss the implications .",
    "the simulations we present were conducted up to a resolution of @xmath0 with the athena code ( gardiner & stone 2005 , 2008 ; stone et al .  2008 ; stone & gardiner 2008 ) on a three - dimensional cartesian grid of length @xmath1 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "athena utilizes a higher - order godunov scheme which exactly conserves mass , momentum , and magnetic flux .",
    "we solve the equations of ideal isothermal mhd , @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the isothermal sound speed and pressure , respectively . because our method of driving the turbulence , described in the following paragraph , does not involve modifying the equations of mhd , we include no explicit forcing term here .",
    "we use an approximate nonlinear riemann solver ( hlld ; miyoshi & kusano 2005 ) for our mhd runs and an exact nonlinear riemann solver for our hydrodynamic runs . both our mhd and hydro simulations are integrated well past the turbulent saturation time using a directionally - unsplit van leer scheme ( stone & gardiner 2008 ) .",
    "further details of how we overcame the numerical difficulties associated with utilizing this method for turbulence can be found in appendix [ sec : godunov ] .",
    "we initialize a uniform , stationary ambient medium with density @xmath7 and magnetic field parallel to the @xmath8-axis whose amplitude @xmath9 is fixed by the value of @xmath10 .",
    "we then apply divergence - free velocity perturbations following a gaussian random distribution with a fourier power spectrum of the form @xmath11 for @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the resolution and @xmath14 is the wavenumber of peak driving , in all but two of our runs . for the remaining two runs , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 at @xmath0 ,",
    "we truncate the driving spectrum at @xmath17 . before applying the perturbations to the grid ,",
    "we shift them such that no net momentum will be added and normalize them to give the desired energy injection rate , @xmath18 , or , in the decaying case , initial kinetic energy .    for our driven runs ,",
    "we choose our energy injection rate to give the desired turbulent mach number , @xmath19 , in the saturated state . here ,",
    "@xmath20^{1/2}$ ] is the 3d velocity dispersion of the gas and @xmath21 is the 1d velocity dispersion in a given direction .",
    "the method we use in this paper to compute the turbulent mach number differs from that used by some other groups ; we utilize a density - weighted velocity dispersion , @xmath22^{1/2}$ ] . note that , due to the zero net momentum of our turbulent medium , the second term on the rhs vanishes on the global scale . if we compare the mach number computed with and without density - weighting the velocity dispersion , we find that the two are fairly correlated , but that the time - average of the latter is @xmath23 larger than that of the former for driven strong - field mhd turbulence with , e.g. , @xmath16 and @xmath15 , or @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the comparison for the latter case is shown in figure [ fig : machmeth ] .",
    "we will use a density - weighted velocity dispersion for all but our sonic scale analysis .    to drive turbulence in our simulations ,",
    "we inject energy before each time step , with a new realization of the power spectrum generated at intervals @xmath26 .",
    "this differs from that done in s98 and v03 , where the energy was injected only when a new realization of the spectrum was generated .",
    "ostriker et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2001 ) and kowal et al .",
    "( 2007 ) used different driving spectra than our own but still constrained their velocity perturbations to be divergence free .",
    "our method differs from that of k07 in that they approximate an isothermal equation of state using an adiabatic index of @xmath27 , drive their turbulence on very large scales using an acceleration that is fixed in time , and also allow a substantial fraction of the energy introduced by the forcing to be in compressional modes .",
    "p07 also used a fixed acceleration for turbulent driving .",
    "it is important to understand if these differences have any significant impact on the results .    for our decaying runs ,",
    "we again begin with a uniform , stationary ambient medium but apply only one driving impulse to the velocity field , with a power spectrum of the same form as is used to initialize our driven runs .",
    "we then allow it to evolve undisturbed .",
    "we choose the turbulent kinetic energy applied to our medium so as to give the desired initial turbulent mach number .",
    "our decaying runs differ from those of sytine et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who used a different initial driving spectrum and allowed a compressible component in the initial perturbations .",
    "they used an adiabatic equation of state with @xmath28 , which we will use only for our decaying simulations . in this case",

    "the numerical methods in athena conserve total energy exactly .",
    "we primarily investigate strong - field mhd turbulence with @xmath35 and hydrodynamic turbulence ( @xmath36 ) , although we present runs with @xmath37 ( moderate - field ) and @xmath38 ( weak - field ) as well .",
    "note that , due to a definition of @xmath39 in s98 and v03 that differs from ours by a factor of 2 , our @xmath35 results should be compared to their @xmath40 results , and similarly for other values of @xmath39 .",
    "the magnetic fields we use in our simulations correspond to physical values of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the temperature and @xmath43 is the number density of molecular hydrogen .",
    "our simulations are scale - free , allowing them to be scaled to any set of physical parameters using appropriate choices of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . utilizing the same values given in s98 , i.e. @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , yields energy injection rates of up to @xmath50 , with a magnetic field strength @xmath51 for the strong - field case .",
    "figure [ fig : den1024p2a ] shows slices in mass density along the far faces of the computational domain for driven @xmath52 strong - field mhd turbulence with @xmath16 at @xmath0 .",
    "also included are magnetic field vectors in a slice normal to the y - axis near the bottom of the cube . due to the strong background magnetic field ,",
    "the vectors are fairly well aligned .",
    "figure [ fig : den1024p2d ] also shows slices in density , but this time for @xmath53 hydrodynamic turbulence with the same driving scale and resolution . for both cases the structure seen is filamentary , with anisotropy in the scale of the structures in the strong - field case as a result of the field",
    "this is not to say , however , that the filaments are aligned with the magnetic field .",
    "in fact , some appear to be oriented perpendicular to the field . figures [ fig : col1024p2a ] and [ fig : col1024p2d ] show column density along the line of sight parallel to the z - axis for the same runs as in figures [ fig : den1024p2a ] and [ fig : den1024p2d ] , respectively .",
    "the projected filamentary structure is visible in these column density images .",
    "the column density contrast is higher for the strong - field than for the hydrodynamic case .",
    "we begin our quantitative analysis by studying the energy in fluctuations once our driven turbulence runs have reached saturation .",
    "since the method with which we drive our turbulence injects energy at a constant rate , at saturation the energy dissipation rate of the turbulence will , on average , equal the energy injection rate . at sufficiently high numerical resolution , the numerical dissipation will become negligible compared to the physically interesting sources of dissipation ( shocks ) , and the energy dissipation properties of the turbulence can given us insight into the heating within and evolution of molecular clouds . in this section , we will first determine the resolution at which the saturation energy has converged , i.e. reached a state such that further increasing the resolution has a negligible effect on the state , for turbulence evolved using athena and compare the turbulent decay rates to those presented in s98 computed using zeus .",
    "the kinetic energy associated with the fluctuations in our turbulent medium can be quantified by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the density and @xmath56 is the magnitude of the velocity .",
    "an integration for this and all similar quantities is performed over the entire domain .",
    "similarly , the energy in magnetic field perturbations is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath9 are the magnitudes , respectively , of the magnetic field and its initial value .",
    "the total energy in perturbations is the sum of the energy in kinetic and magnetic field fluctuations , @xmath59 . to analyze the energy dissipation properties of the turbulence , we compute dissipation timescales using @xmath60 , normalizing them to the flow crossing time , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the wavelength of peak driving .",
    "we can partition the kinetic energy by breaking down the velocity into its solenoidal and compressive components .",
    "the solenoidal component is divergence - free , whereas the compressive component is curl - free .",
    "these can easily be computed using @xmath63 \\hat{k}$ ] and @xmath64 \\times \\hat{k}$ ] , respectively . for simulations with comparable parameters ( i.e. @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) ,",
    "these energies can be compared directly with the values given in s98 and v03 after accounting for the difference in definition of @xmath39 .",
    "we average our quantities over at least one dynamical time , often several , beginning after the turbulence has fully saturated .    to determine the rate of convergence of a given volume - integrated quantity , @xmath65 , we compute the percent error in the quantity at each resolution relative to the converged value . in the case where the quantity changes monotonically with resolution , we find the converged value by performing a three - parameter fit , @xmath66 , where @xmath13 is the resolution and @xmath67 is the value at that resolution",
    ". the results of this fit tell us ( 1 ) the converged value , @xmath68 , ( 2 ) the order of convergence , @xmath69 , and ( 3 ) the coefficient , @xmath70 , that determines the resolution at which our result has converged , i.e. when @xmath71 .      to determine the resolution at which our numerical dissipation has become small compared to shock dissipation , we analyze the properties of driven , supersonic hydrodynamic turbulence at resolutions from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "we study two sets of simulations with identical energy injection rate , @xmath25 , but differing driving scales .",

    "we begin by verifying that athena can reproduce the bottleneck .",
    "these are the only set of adiabatic runs we will consider .",
    "the initial velocity perturbations in these decaying runs have the same form of power spectrum as in our driven runs with @xmath74 and are normalized to give an initial turbulent mach number of @xmath152 .",

    "figure [ fig : hdcpwr1k4res ] shows the uncompensated velocity power spectrum at this time for runs with resolutions from @xmath94 to @xmath0 . as expected , this plot appears very similar to figure 11 of sytine et al .",
    "since athena was designed to have low numerical dissipation , the bottleneck is strong in our simulations of mildly - compressible ( subsonic ) turbulence .    analyzing the compressive and solenoidal components of the velocity separately , we find that the bottleneck appears quite strong in the ps of the latter while apparently absent in that of the former .",
    "this is not surprising as shocks directly couple large and small scales , allowing the compressive energy to bypass the turbulent cascade and be immediately dissipated .",
    "the absence of the bottleneck in the compressive component agrees with the results of porter et al .",

    "although this could be an artifact of the code related to its treatment of shocks , one should be wary of putting too much stock in the high-@xmath154 region of any power spectrum as effects such as aliasing ( introduced in the calculation of the power spectrum , not the fluid dynamics ) could substantially alter the power in that region ( see , e.g. , press et al .",

    "although it may be argued that a slope this shallow must be due to a bottleneck , the range of scales with steeper slope is far too limited to conclude this definitively from our data .",

    "as before , the slope we have found is much shallower than is typically predicted predicted for the inertial range , while being steeper than that presented in k07 as the bottleneck spectral slope .",

    "it has been argued by k07 that the quantity @xmath168 should have an inertial range power law of @xmath169 even for supersonic turbulence , but we see over a wide range of wavenumbers a @xmath170 law ( figure [ fig : mpwr1u2res ] ) .",
    "kurien et al .  (",
    "2004 ) have shown for subsonic turbulence that , while the @xmath169 law is appropriate when the energy timescale dominates over the helicity timescale , a @xmath170 law is expected when the helicity timescale is non - negligible compared to the energy timescale , even when the relative helicity may seem insignificant .",
    "this should be investigated as a possible cause of the bottleneck effect in supersonic turbulence .    over the range @xmath171 ,",
    "the compressive component ( figure [ fig : mpwr1c2res ] ) of the @xmath73 run follows a power law @xmath172 . for @xmath0 run",
    ", the power spectrum appears to smoothly change slope , indicating that it is not a power law , but a longer time - average might change the shape .",

    "parallel to the mean field , the power law is roughly @xmath175 , similar to that of the purely hydrodynamic case .",
    "perpendicular to the field , however , the slope is much more shallow , roughly @xmath170 .",
    "we find the power spectrum of the compressive component of velocity to be nearly isotropic , in contradiction to what was found in v03 .",
    "the velocity power spectrum of _ subsonic _ turbulence results from a conservative cascade of energy from large to small scales through interactions local in fourier space .",
    "it is commonly believed that the velocity spectrum of supersonic turbulence , because it too is a power law , must also result from such a cascade .",
    "it is commonly known , however , that the power spectrum of a discontinuity , or an ensemble of shocks as in burgers turbulence , also have velocity spectra that follow a power law , @xmath159 . in figure",
    "[ fig : blastcomprimh ] , we confirm that the compressive component of velocity in our @xmath94 supersonic , strong - field mhd turbulence run with @xmath16 has a spectrum similar to that of velocity in an mhd blast wave that was initially spherical .",
    "this calls into question the long - held assumption that the power spectrum seen in supersonic turbulence results from an energy cascade facilitated by interactions local in fourier space .",
    "it would seem that other diagnostics , such as structure functions , are necessary in order to determine the cause of the power law spectrum , either a fourier - space cascade as in incompressible turbulence , or an ensemble of shocks as in burgers turbulence .    to get a clearer idea of which features in our power spectra are representative of the turbulence and which were introduced in the post - processing , we compare power spectra computed by multiple methods .",
    "our control spectrum will be computed as were the others presented in this section  averaged over the cells within a shell and then multiplied by the volume of the shell , @xmath145 , which we will refer to as `` shell - averaged '' for the remainder of this section .",
    "our comparison will be to another commonly used method ( e.g.  p07 ) , where the power is simply summed over the cells falling within the shell ( `` shell - summed '' ) .",
    "these methods differ due to the discretization of the grid , i.e. because the fourier - space volume occupied by the cells within a bin is not , in general , equal to the volume of the perfectly spherical shell that the bin represents .",
    "while the bins in our control spectrum are centered on integer values of @xmath176 , those in the alternative spectrum instead run _ between _ integer values .",
    "we use the time - averaged power spectrum of the driven strong - field mhd turbulence run at @xmath73 for our comparison , although the effect should be independent of the run being analyzed . when overplotting the spectra produced by these two methods ( see figure [ fig : psmethod ] )",
    ", the most obvious difference is at low @xmath154 .",
    "although the shell - averaged spectrum is relatively smooth in the range @xmath177 , the other has a jagged shape over this same range resulting from its sensitivity to the number of cells falling within a bin , making the `` slope '' of the power spectrum in this region much less obvious .",
    "if we compare the shell - summed spectrum to one computed by the same method but with the bins shifted by half a bin width ( aligning these bins with our own ) , we find that shape of the spectrum at low @xmath154 changes considerably . if , on the other hand , we take the shell - averaged spectrum and compare it to one computed in the same manner but with bins shifted to align with those typically used in the shell - summed method , we see that , although the power in each bin does change , the shape and slope of the spectrum change very little .",
    "while neither method is right or wrong , we advise caution when choosing a binning method for power spectra ; differences in slope computed by different means are not necessarily indicative of different turbulent states .",
    "although molecular clouds have supersonic velocity dispersions on large scales , as one looks to smaller and smaller scales , turbulent compressions will become progressively weaker , at some point becoming subsonic .",
    "the length scale at which the rms velocity dispersion is equal to the sound speed is referred to as the sonic scale ( mckee & ostriker 2007 ) .",
    "we now investigate how the velocity dispersion varies on spatial scales larger than the sonic scale , where shocks are most important .",
    "this scaling can be determined observationally in the form of linewidth - size relations using many different methods .",
    "for example , brunt ( 2003 ) used principal component analysis ( pca ) to determine the linewidth - size relation within individual clouds .    to determine the velocity dispersion at a given length scale , @xmath178 , where @xmath179 and @xmath180 is an integer",
    ", we divide our computational domain along each axis into @xmath181 sections , yielding @xmath182 sub - volumes .",
    "we compute the velocity dispersion in each sub - volume and then average over all sub - volumes at that scale .",
    "because crossing the sonic scale represents a change in the physics dominating the flow , i.e. waves steeping to form shocks , for this analysis only we will compute the velocity dispersion without mass - weighting , i.e. @xmath20^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath183^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "figure [ fig : sonichyd ] shows the velocity dispersion versus length scale for the @xmath0 , @xmath184 driven hydrodynamic turbulence run with @xmath16 . since driving may affect the scaling relation , we truncate our driving spectrum at @xmath17 , where the driving has already dropped to only @xmath88 of the peak level , and consider only this and smaller scales .",
    "fitting to the data points falling between the sonic scale and the driving cutoff , a factor of eight in length , we find a clear power law of the form @xmath185 .",
    "this scaling index falls well within the range of indices found observationally by brunt ( 2003 ) .",
    "shown in figure [ fig : sonicmhd ] is the velocity dispersion versus length scale for the @xmath0 , @xmath184 driven strong - field mhd turbulence run with @xmath16 .",
    "this time , over the range of scales where the flow is supersonic , we find that the slope is not a power law .",
    "unlike in hydrodynamic turbulence , the sonic scale is not the only scale at which the dominant physics changes . in fact , we would expect the multiple wave families of mhd to lead to multiple transitions , and for strong fields , these transitions are widely separated .",
    "for example , parallel to the magnetic field , slow waves will travel at the sound speed , whereas fast waves will travel at the alfvn speed .",
    "perpendicular to the field , however , the slow waves will have zero velocity and the fast waves will travel with a speed @xmath186 .",
    "this is complicated further by the fact that the parallel and perpendicular directions are defined relative to the _ local _ magnetic field , not the mean field . as a result",
    ", we have no reason to expect a uniform power law between the sonic scale and driving cutoff .",
    "it is not clear to what extent this result is affected by dissipation .      up to this point",
    "we have averaged quantities from multiple snapshots in order to minimize the effect of rare events on our results .",
    "our final set of diagnostics will instead be an analysis of the time - variability and temperature intermittency of the turbulent gas .",
    "we begin by analyzing the time - variability of some of the quantities we analyzed in  [ sec : satresults ] . for our hydrodynamic",
    "runs with the smallest driving scale , @xmath24 , we find the time - variability of the saturation energy to be only half a percent at both @xmath94 and @xmath73 .",
    "time - variability of less than a percent agrees with the results in s98 even though they drove their turbulence impulsively .",
    "the time - variability quoted in k07 , however , is much higher .",
    "the k07 runs were driven at a much larger driving scale than our own . to investigate if this could be the reason for the discrepancy",
    ", we will also analyze the time - variability of our runs with larger driving scales .",
    "when we increase the driving scale to @xmath74 , we find the time - variability of the energy to be a full percent at both @xmath94 and @xmath73 .",
    "as both the driving scale and mach number are varied here as compared to the run we discussed above , this could be due to either .",
    "when we increase the driving scale further , to @xmath16 , without changing the mach number , we find the time - variability increases yet again , coming to @xmath93 at @xmath94 and approaching @xmath187 at @xmath73 .",
    "it would seem that the driving scale chosen has a significant impact on the time - variability of the energy .",
    "the values we find here are still less than that shown in the k07 figure , however .    for strong - field mhd , we again find time - variability of about half a percent for the @xmath24 runs .",
    "increasing the driving scale to @xmath74 decreases the time - variability at @xmath94 but increases it a small amount at @xmath73 . increasing the driving scale further , to @xmath16 , yields time - variability of @xmath188 at @xmath94 and @xmath187 at @xmath73 , comparable to the hydro runs .    when we compare the time - variability of the energy among hydro runs at @xmath73 with varied mach number that are driven at @xmath74 , we find that the relation is non - monotonic . with @xmath16 , however",
    ", we do see a monotonic relationship , with the time - variability increasing with mach number . for our strong - field mhd runs",
    ", we again find non - monotonicity at @xmath74 , while the time - variability increases with mach number at @xmath16 , with the exception of the lowest mach number run .      a feature of turbulence that may have a strong influence on star formation is intermittency , dissipation that is highly localized in space and time ( mckee & ostriker 2007 ) .",
    "although such dissipation does not require shocks , it is worthwhile to study the shock contribution in supersonic turbulence . were we not assuming an isothermal equation of state , energy dissipation in these regions would lead to local heating and thus increased temperatures , which would be evident in observations .",
    "therefore , to study intermittency due to shocks , we analyze the maximum heating rate per unit mass , @xmath189 , a surrogate for temperature .    since we expect the maximum heating rate , @xmath190 , to be strongly influenced by rare events , such as the interaction of multiple shocks , we consider the time - variability of this quantity . due to the discretization of the grid , however , we would expect a component of the time - variability to be due to grid - scale fluctuations .",
    "therefore , instead of considering @xmath190 directly , we consider the statistics of the high-@xmath191 tail of the pdf of the heating rate per unit mass . for each simulation that we consider , we compute the heating rate per unit mass , @xmath191 , in each cell over many snapshots . considering only the cells in each snapshot that compose the @xmath88 of material ( by mass or volume ) with the highest cell - averaged @xmath191 , we compute the mean value . following the time - variability of this value should allow us to ignore meaningless grid - scale fluctuations while studying the intermittency due to shocks .",
    "for driven hydrodynamic turbulence at @xmath73 , we find the low mach number runs driven at @xmath74 to have less than @xmath88 variability in the peak temperature , while the higher mach number runs with this same driving scale can have variability as large as @xmath93 but without a monotonic dependence on mach number . at the larger driving scale @xmath16 , however , the variability in the peak temperature always exceeds @xmath88 and can be as high as @xmath187 .",
    "it would seem that this , like the time - variability of the saturation energies , increases with driving scale . for our runs",
    ", the variability of the peak temperature as measured by the top @xmath88 of the volume never exceeds that from the top @xmath88 of the mass by more than a tiny amount .",
    "as we have very few data dumps with which to calculate the statistics , however , the quantitative behavior may not be robust .",
    "we find that , in @xmath73 strong - field mhd turbulence driven at @xmath16 , the variability of the peak temperature can be as large as @xmath192 .",
    "when driven at @xmath74 , however , the variability always decreases , never exceeding @xmath188 .",
    "the variability measured by the top @xmath88 of mass is typically larger than that from the top @xmath88 of volume , but there does not appear to be a strong dependence on mach number . more often than not , the variability in the strong - field mhd runs are larger than in the hydro runs at the same mach number .",
    "again , however , these statistics are computed from very few data dumps , making them subject to large errors .",
    "figure [ fig : mmitt4 ] shows the time - evolution of the peak temperature in the @xmath74 strong - field mhd run with @xmath25 , for which we have better than typical statistics , compared to the @xmath16 run with @xmath15 .",
    "the saturation energies and dissipation timescales we find support the conclusion of s98 that supersonic turbulence dissipates rapidly even in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the results of our godunov code agree with zeus , an operator - split method that relies on artificial viscosity to capture shocks , but reach convergence at slightly lower resolutions . at @xmath73",
    "the difference in the total energy in fluctuations between athena and zeus for strong - field mhd is very small , indicating that these two codes converge to similar turbulent states at sufficiently high resolution .",
    "the convergence resolution of our simulations depends both on the driving scale and the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "while hydro turbulence driven at @xmath74 converges by @xmath86 , strong - field mhd turbulence driven at @xmath24 does not converge until @xmath73 .",
    "although very high resolutions are needed to capture the inertial range of the turbulence , lower resolutions are often adequate for studying the energy dissipation characteristics of the turbulence as well as other volume - integrated quantities .    at high mach number , the ratio of the dissipation timescale to the flow crossing time at the driving scale increases with increasing magnetic field strength ; however , it does not exceed unity even for strong - field mhd turbulence .",
    "this ratio is independent of driving scale .",
    "the fractions of the kinetic energy in solenoidal and compressive modes are also independent of driving scale , with the compressive fraction generally being more than twice as high for hydrodynamic than for strong - field mhd turbulence .    our spherically - integrated velocity power spectra for decaying , subsonic hydrodynamic turbulence show evidence of the bottleneck effect in the velocity power spectrum , consistent with the findings of sytine et al .",
    "we find more power at high wavenumber in our driven , supersonic hydro and mhd turbulence simulations than was found by v03 , but it is unclear , particularly in the mhd case , whether or not this is due to a bottleneck .",
    "resolutions exceeding @xmath0 will be necessary to draw firm conclusions about the slope of the inertial range .",
    "the cylindrically - averaged velocity power spectrum for driven mhd turbulence is very anisotropic ; it has a slope that approximates that of the hydrodynamic case parallel to the magnetic field , while perpendicular to the field it is much more shallow .",
    "the compressive component of velocity has an isotropic power spectrum , contrary to what was found in v03 .",
    "we find the compressive component of velocity in driven , supersonic mhd turbulence to have a power spectrum that is difficult to distinguish from the velocity spectrum of an initially - spherical mhd blast wave .",
    "this calls into question the long - held assumption that supersonic turbulence power spectra result from an energy cascade facilitated by interactions local in fourier space",
    ". the analysis of structure functions may be useful in determining the source of the power law spectrum in supersonic turbulence , either a fourier - space cascade as in incompressible turbulence , or an ensemble of shocks as in burgers turbulence .    for hydrodynamic turbulence , we find a power law scaling of the velocity dispersion with spatial scale , @xmath193 , for scales where the velocity dispersion is supersonic . however , we find no such power law for strong - field mhd turbulence , where the sonic scale is not the only scale of interest . in this case , we find that the velocity dispersion drops off more rapidly than a power law as one approaches smaller scales .",
    "we see time - variability in the saturation energies comparable to that of the equivalent runs in s98 despite the impulsive driving employed therein .",
    "our time - variability increases when we apply our turbulent driving at larger scales , but remains lower than that shown in k07 even with @xmath16 .",
    "it is possible that the acceleration - based driving method of k07 is responsible for the difference . at this large driving scale , the time - variability increases with mach number for both hydro and strong - field mhd .",
    "the method used to drive the turbulence appears to have a substantial impact on the resulting turbulent state .",
    "further investigation should be conducted to determine how much of the increase in time - variability with driving scale is due to the limited range of scales over which an inverse cascade can occur . if the level of time - variability is determined to be a result of simulation setup and not representative of the physical system we are trying to simulate , better diagnostics or simulation methods need to be developed in order to quantify intermittency in turbulent media .",
    "although we have very poor statistics in our temperature intermittency analysis , it appears that this , too , increases with driving scale .",
    "considering the difference that the driving method makes on the results , it may be more realistic to study decaying turbulence instead of driving it arbitrarily .    for identical turbulent data cubes , we find that the post - processing methods chosen significantly influence the results .",
    "the turbulent mach number changes by @xmath23 depending on the method used in its computation .",
    "the means of computing the power spectrum also has a strong influence on the power at wavenumbers overlapping with the inertial range .",
    "when comparing results published by different groups , one should keep in mind that this , as well as the code , driving method , and initial conditions , can affect the quantities being compared .",
    "although the saturation energies and energy dissipation characteristics of the turbulence converge at resolutions within our current computational capabilities , the power spectra appear to require much higher resolutions to provide valuable information . also considering that turbulent power spectra can be approximated by non - turbulent phenomena",
    ", it would seem that , for the time being , our focus should be on other diagnostics .",
    "in conducting these numerical simulations , we have made many simplifications in order to make the problem more tractable .",
    "these assumptions , however , may prove to significantly impact the results .",
    "future studies should consider non - ideal mhd in order to model low - ionization molecular clouds , a non - isothermal equation of state in order to study heating and cooling , and self - gravity in order to follow the collapse of the bound clumps that form in the turbulent medium .",
    "we thank eve ostriker for very productive discussion and tom gardiner for his invaluable assistance in bringing athena up to the task of successfully simulating supersonic turbulence .",
    "we would also like to thank alexei kritsuk , cristoph federrath , and alex lazarian for their feedback .",
    "simulations were performed on the ibm blue gene at princeton and on computational facilities supported by nsf grants ast-0216105 and ast-0722479 .",
    "the calculations presented in this paper were conducted using athena , a directionally - unsplit , higher - order godunov code .",
    "this code exactly conserves mass , momentum , and magnetic flux , as well as energy when assuming an adiabatic equation of state .",
    "the code captures shocks well and has a low level of numerical dissipation .",
    "although the full details of the algorithms and implementation can be found in the literature ( gardiner & stone 2005 , 2008 ; stone et al .",
    "2008 ; stone & gardiner 2008 ) , we will briefly summarize here , noting any modifications made to the algorithms in order to successfully run the challenging problem of high mach number turbulence .    the integration algorithm used in our calculations is a simple predictor - corrector scheme based on the muscl - hancock scheme of van leer ( 2006 ) , combined with the constrained transport method of evans & hawley ( 1998 ) to enforce the divergence - free constraint on the magnetic field ( i.e. the vl+ct algorithm described in detail in stone & gardiner 2008 ) .",
    "we find the additional diffusion associated with this scheme as compared to our ctu+ct algorithm ( described in detail in stone et al .",
    "2008 ) to make it more robust to the strong rarefactions that arise in a highly turbulent medium .",
    "although the algorithm is formally only second - order accurate , we use third order ( piecewise parabolic ) spatial reconstruction , finding it to provide more accurate solutions in test problems due to smaller truncation error .    for our isothermal hydrodynamics runs , we found there to be strong rarefactions within the turbulent medium for which an approximate riemann solver simply was not accurate enough , necessitating the use of an exact nonlinear riemann solver . for adiabatic hydrodynamics as well as isothermal and adiabatic mhd",
    ", we were able to use approximate nonlinear riemann solvers , namely hllc for the hydro case and hlld for mhd , more details about which can be found in stone et al .",
    "although we used our own adaptation of the adiabatic hlld solver of miyoshi & kusano ( 2005 ) for our isothermal mhd runs , we found it to produce turbulent states extremely similar to those from the isothermal hlld solver of mignone ( 2007 ) .",
    "although these riemann solvers are positive definite in 1d , it is not guaranteed that they will be so in multidimensions .",
    "in fact , we found that , under extreme conditions , the net mass flux out of a cell in our isothermal 3d turbulent medium occasionally exceeded the cell s initial mass . in the rare circumstance that this occurred , we recomputed the fluxes of all variables through all interfaces bordering such cells using first - order reconstruction . in our mach 7 strong - field mhd",
    "run at @xmath73 that uses @xmath16 , this affected only a fraction @xmath194 of the fluxes computed in the corrector step of the integrator .",
    "dropping to first order introduced enough diffusion in the immediate vicinity to keep the cell - averaged density positive , while having a negligible effect on the overall system . adding diffusion in this manner instead of enforcing a density floor maintains exact conservation .",
