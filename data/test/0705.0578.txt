    "recently , we have shown that layered sine - gordon type models are probably not suitable for the description of josephson - coupled layered superconductors , because the linear , confining potential that binds the vortices together can not be obtained from the interaction of the topological excitations of the model , no matter how the interlayer interaction term is chosen  @xcite . on the other hand , vortex dominated properties of high @xmath0 layered superconductors and other types of layered materials , e.g. superconducting sandwiches ,",
    "have already received a considerable amount of attention ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and the intuitively obvious connection of sine - gordon models to these materials makes one wonder if at least , a restricted applicability of the layered , field - theoretical model persists .",
    "we also observe that recently , there is an increasing interest in the literature @xcite in constructing sine  gordon type field theoretical models in order to understand better the vortex dynamics in layered superconducting systems . our aim in this paper to follow this route by constructing a two - dimensional multi - layer sine - gordon type model which can be used to describe the vortex behaviour of magnetically as opposed to josephson - coupled layered superconductors , and to contrast and enhance our recent investigation  @xcite .    in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) isolated superconducting thin film ,",
    "the pearl vortices  @xcite are naturally identified as the topological excitations and can be considered as the charged analogues of the vortices in a 2d superfluid which generate the kosterlitz ",
    "thouless  berezinski ( ktb ) phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic interaction between the vortices of the superfluid extends to infinity and as a consequence they remain bound below the finite ktb transition temperature ( @xmath1 ) and dissociate above it  @xcite . since the pearl vortices carry electric charge , they always remain unbound due to the screening length @xmath2 generated by the electromagnetic field which cuts off the logarithmic interaction @xcite and leads to the absence of any ktb phase transition . however , for realistic finite 2d superconducting films where the lateral dimension of the film can be smaller then the screening length @xmath3 the ktb transition can be restored @xcite .",
    "this constitutes an intrinsic finite size effect .    in layered materials ,",
    "the interlayer coupling modifies the 2d picture and leads to new types of topological defects .",
    "if the layers are coupled by josephson coupling ( like for many htsc materials ) , the vortex - antivortex pairs on the same layer interact with each other via a logarithmic term for small distances but they feel a linear confining potential for large distances ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . the vortices in neighboring layers always interact via a linear potential which can couple them by forming vortex loops , rings , or vortex `` strings '' piercing all layers .    if the layers are coupled by purely magnetic interaction ( e.g. in artificially produced superlattices where the cooper pair tunneling between the superconducting layers is suppressed by relatively large insulating layers ) the topological defects for a system which consists of infinitely many layers are pancake vortices  @xcite which undergo a ktb phase transition at @xmath1 . as explained e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite , the josephson coupling can be essentially neglected when the confinement length , i.e.  the length scale at which the linear confining potential due to the josephson coupling dominates over the logarithmic interaction due to magnetic effects , is pushed beyond the effective screening length for the logarithmic interaction among vortices .",
    "this situation is present when the tunneling between the superconducting layers is suppressed by relatively large insulating layers , and a proposal for a experimental realization has recently been given  @xcite . for a finite number @xmath4 of magnetically coupled layers ,",
    "the pearl type vortex stack  @xcite is broken up into a number of coupled pancake vortices of fractional flux  @xcite , and this configuration undergoes a ktb - type phase transition at a layer - dependent temperature @xmath5 which is connected with the dissociation of the stack .",
    "this result has been obtained on the basis of the entropy method first introduced in the ground - breaking work  @xcite .",
    "recently , a real space renormalization - group ( rg ) analysis of the case @xmath6 has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite using the dilute gas approximation . a priori",
    ", it appears to be rather difficult to generalize this rg analysis for @xmath7 layers .    in general , the ginzburg  landau ( gl ) theory @xcite provides us with a good theoretical framework in which to investigate the vortex dynamics in thin films and in layered materials .",
    "several equivalent models , like field - theoretical , statistical spin models and a gas of topological defects have also been used to consider the vortex properties of films and layered systems .",
    "the 2d - gl , 2d - xy and the 2d coulomb gas models ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) are considered as the appropriate theoretical background for the vortex dynamics of superfluid films . the field theoretical counterpart is the 2d sine - gordon ( sg ) model @xcite . both kinds of these models belong to the same universality class and produce the ktb phase transition . for superconducting films one has to consider the 2d - gl model in the presence of electromagnetic interactions @xcite or the equivalent gas of topological excitations , the 2d yukawa gas @xcite . the corresponding field theory is the 2d - sg model with an explicit mass term , the massive 2d - sg model @xcite .    for josephson - coupled layered superconductors in the case of very large anisotropy one should investigate the layered gl model including the josephson coupling between the layers  @xcite ( i.e. the lawrence - doniach model  @xcite ) . in case of not too large anisotropy on",

    "( i ) the prefactor @xmath64 appearing in the intralayer interaction indicates the existence of vortices with fractional flux in the mlsg model .",
    "( ii ) for small distances @xmath65 , the interlayer interaction @xmath66 disappears and the intralayer potential @xmath67 has the same logarithmic behaviour with full flux as that of the pure 2d - sg model ( which belongs to the same universality class as the 2d - xy model and the 2d coulomb gas ) .",
    "therefore , the mlsg model for small distances behaves as an uncoupled system of 2d - sg models .",
    "( iii ) for the case @xmath68 , there exists no interlayer interaction , and the intralayer potential is logarithmic for small distances and vanishes for large distances .",
    "consequently , there are always free , non - interacting vortices in the model which push the ktb transition temperature to zero .",
    "the mlsg model for a single layer reduces to the massive 2d - sg model discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite where the periodicity in the internal space is broken and the ktb transition is absent .",
    "( iv ) in the bulk limit @xmath69 , the effective screening length and the interlayer interaction disappear ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) , and the intralayer potential has a logarithmic behaviour with full flux , thus the mlsg model predicts the same behaviour as that of the pure 2dsg model with @xmath72 .",
    "alternatively , one may observe that for @xmath73 , the effect of the infinitely many zero - mass modes dominates over the effect of the single remaining massive mode entirely , leading to a constant limit for the transition temperature as @xmath74 .    for @xmath6 layers , the mlsg model [ with the choice",
    "@xmath75 has been proposed to describe the vortex properties of josephson coupled layered superconductors @xcite .",
    "however , the above discussed mapping indicates that any layered sine ",
    "gordon model , whatever be the mass matrix , can be mapped onto an equivalent gas of topological excitations , whose interaction potentials are determined by the inversion of a two - dimensional propagator of the form @xmath76 .",
    "any such propagator , upon backtransformation to coordinate space , can only lead to a logarithmic behaviour for the vortex interactions at small and large distances , and consequently , can not possibly reproduce the confining linear long - range intralayer interaction given in eq .",
    "( 8.42 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "the candidate  @xcite for a mass matrix @xmath77 has also been discussed in refs .",
    "this candidate interaction is inspired by a discretization of the anisotropic 3d - sg model  @xcite , but it can not reproduce the linear confining potential needed for the description of the josephson - coupled case  @xcite .",
    "the layer - dependent transition temperature of this model is @xmath78 and decreases with the number of layers , and for general @xmath4 , the mass matrix @xmath79 also leads to different short- and long - range intralayer potentials as compared to eq .",
