    "the end - point singularities become more serious in the qcdf analysis of the @xmath16 decays @xcite .",
    "it has been claimed that the data of those modes involving @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are not understandable in qcdf , and only those involving @xmath20 are @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 decays have been also studied in light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) @xcite , and the small branching ratio from the factorizable contribution @xcite , @xmath21 was confirmed .",
    "the nonfactorizable contributions considered in @xcite refer , however , to those arising from the three - parton kaon distribution amplitudes . in the corresponding diagrams an additional valence gluon from the kaon attaches one of the charm quarks in the @xmath17 meson . adding these pieces , one arrived at the parameter @xmath22 , which is still insufficient to account for the data .",

    "we doubt that the conclusion from qcdf is solid for two reasons .",
    "first , the end - point singularities render the estimation of the nonfactorizable contributions out of control .",
    "second , the simple asymptotic models were adopted for the charmonium distribution amplitudes , which , without any theoretical and experimental bases , may underestimate the nonfactorizable contributions .",

    "[ fvs ] using the following method .",
    "we take into account the vertex corrections through the variation of the renormalization scale for the factorizable contributions , because their evaluation requires more theoretical inputs , which have not yet been available .",
    "the spectator amplitudes will be computed in the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach based on @xmath1 factorization theorem @xcite .",
    "the formalism , similar to that of the color - suppressed mode @xmath23 @xcite , is free from the end - point singularities .",
    "we infer the charmonium distribution amplitudes from the non - relativistic heavy quarkonium bound - state wave functions , which have been shown to well explain the cross section of charmonium production in @xmath24 collisions @xcite .",
    "based on the universality of hadron distribution amplitudes , these more sophisticated models should be able to account for the exclusive @xmath6 meson decays into charmonia , if qcd factorization theorem works .",
    "the @xmath25 decays have been studied in pqcd @xcite , compared to which the new ingredients of this work are : 1 ) we clarify several controversial statements on the end - point singularities in the @xmath26 analysis in the literature ; 2 ) the @xmath27 meson distribution amplitudes derived from qcd sum rules @xcite are included up to two - parton and twist-3 level ; 3 ) the models for the charmonium distribution amplitudes have both theoretical and experimental bases ; 4 ) not only the @xmath25 decays , but @xmath28 are investigated .",
    "it will be shown that the obtained branching ratios , polarization fractions , and relative phases among various helicity amplitudes , except those of @xmath2 , are all in consistency with the existing data . the observed @xmath2 branching ratios , significantly larger than our results , are the only puzzle .",
