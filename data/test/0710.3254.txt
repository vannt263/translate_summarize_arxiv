    "the dynamics of colloidal particles dispersed in a fluid solvent is quite different from the ballistic motion of molecular systems which is described by newton s law @xcite .",

    "these so - called hydrodynamic interaction is typically long - ranged . while it can be neglected in colloidal suspensions of very small volume fractions",

    "the equilibrium structures and phase boundaries , on the other hand , are unaffected by hydrodynamic interactions .    in the past years a simple nonequilibrium phase transition @xcite has been discussed in a binary mixture of colloidal particles which are driven by a constant external field @xcite . the drive is different on the two particle species and could arise from gravity and from an external electric field in the case of charged colloidal suspensions .",
    "brownian dynamics computer simulations with neglected hydrodynamic interactions strongly support the scenario that - as a function of the driving strength - the mixtures undergoes a transition from a mixed steady - state with anisotropic correlations towards a steady - state where macroscopic lanes are formed .",
    "the transitions has been found for oppositely driven repulsive mixtures @xcite in two and three spatial dimensions and it seems to be a first - order nonequilibrium transition with a significant hysteresis in an order parameter which detects laning @xcite .",
    "the general scenario occurs also in pedestrian dynamics @xcite and in granular matter @xcite .",
    "recently , lane formation was observed in real - space experiments by leunissen et al @xcite .",
    "equimolar mixtures of oppositely charged colloidal particles were prepared which form binary ionic crystals @xcite .",
    "these crystals were exposed to a strong external electric field and the dynamics of lane formation was watched by confocal microscopy .",
    "subsequently extensive brownian dynamics simulations were carried out to map the nonequilibrium phase diagram @xcite .",
    "these simulations assumed a yukawa pair interaction between the particles and neglected hydrodynamic interactions completely .",
    "a wealth of different steady - state structures was detected .",
    "in particular different orderings were found in the plane perpendicular to the drive including a square , triangular or rhombic crystalline lattice of lanes , a network structure with a finite structural length and intermediate chain formation of lanes @xcite .",
    "a rough estimate of the experimental parameters used in ref.@xcite reveals that the laned state observed experimentally indeed falls into the region where laning is expected to occur by brownian dynamics computer simulations .    in this paper",
    "we address the question how hydrodynamic interactions influence the scenario and the steady - state diagram of lane formation .",
    "our motivation to do so is twofold : first , the experiments , of course , contain hydrodynamic interactions in their full glory , and therefore an inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions is needed for a quantitative comparison .",
    "second , there is a principal need to understand in which direction hydrodynamics influence lane formation .",
    "in particular it is known @xcite that the leading long - ranged term in the mobility pair tensor is screened if an electric field is applied since a charged colloidal particles is surrounded by counterions of opposite charge .",
    "that makes the hydrodynamic interaction significantly different from e.g. sedimentation induced by different buoyant masses of oppositely charged colloids where the action of gravity on the microions can safely be neglected . in the latter case ,",
    "the leading part in the mobility tensor at large interparticle separation is the _ unscreened _ oseen tensor",

    "the simulation data are compared to that obtained by simple brownian dynamics where hydrodynamic interactions are neglected . for sedimentation , we find that hydrodynamic interactions strongly disfavor laning . in the steady - state of lanes , a macroscopic phase separation of lanes",
    "is observed , i.e.  the sickness of the lanes are of the system size .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the simple brownian case where a finite size of lanes was obtained in the steady - state . for strong coulomb interactions between the colloidal particles a lateral square lattice of oppositely driven lanes is stable similar to the simple brownian dynamics . in an electric field , on the other hand , the behavior is found in qualitative and quantitative accordance with the case of neglected hydrodynamics .",
    "all lateral structures are reproduced and the topology of the steady - state phase diagram is unchanged .",

    "the correlations between the particles are not sufficient to form lanes at all .",
    "thus , the systems are in a phase of no - lanes . only for very low salt concentration , i.e.  small @xmath70 , where the electrostatic coupling between the colloidal particles is strong",
    ", we find a coexistence region between lanes and no - lanes . here , the region with no - lanes consists of voids , where hardly any particle is found .",
    "the structure of the lane region , on the other hand , is different in the two situations . for situation ( a )",

    "an initial configuration with lanes placed on a square lattice separated from a completely depleted region is stable in simulations , as well .",
    "thus , we assume that in situation ( a ) the lanes / no - lanes phase is a transient state toward a complete square lattice and no - lane phase separation .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions destroy the coexistence phase for @xmath77 .",
    "it only occurs in a denser system with @xmath78 whereas in situation ( a ) this state shows already up at @xmath77 .",
    "additionally , the voids are more pronounced in the latter case compared to situation ( b ) . upon increasing @xmath79 for @xmath78 in both situations",
    "we find a network - like structure whose characteristic spacing is increasing with increasing @xmath70 . for situation ( a )",
    "there is also a small coexistence region between network and square lattice at @xmath80 .    to obtain a quantitative measure of the characteristic spacing in the network structure",

    "it is evident from the picture that the characteristic spacing is indeed growing with increasing @xmath70 .",

    "an additional phase for small inverse screening length shows up in both phase diagrams .",
    "oppositely driven lanes are placed on a square lattice with an alternating charge pattern .",
    "the formation of this lattice structure can be qualitatively understood from an effective interaction between oppositely charged driven lanes which has a short - ranged repulsive and a long - ranged attractive interaction .",

    "the square lattice then reduces the electrostatic energy of the system because each particle has only oppositely charged neighbors . for increasing salt concentrations",
    "we encounter a coexistence region between the square lattice and the network - like phase and finally end up in a pure network - like phase .",

    "the lattice - points in the triangular phase are rather randomly decorated with different charges .",
    "here , the short range repulsion plays the dominant role compared to the electrostatic interaction .",
    "it enforces a triangular lattice due to packing effects although electrostatically it is strongly disfavored because like - charged particles necessarily occupy lattice points next to each other . again",
    ", hydrodynamic interactions slightly shift the phase boundaries towards the network - like structure .",
    "for the highest volume fraction studied , @xmath74 , both phase diagrams show exactly the same behavior . here",
    ", the short range repulsions dictates the phase behavior for nearly all salt concentration but for @xmath98 and enforces lanes to be placed on a triangular lattice . only for @xmath98 , where electrostatic interactions are prominent ,",
    "a square lattice is preferred . in principle",
    "a square lattice is possible up to the packing of a simple cubic lattice of @xmath99 .    in summary",
    "we observe very similar behavior in both situations .",
    "the observed differences can be qualitatively explained by the fact that hydrodynamic interactions disfavor lanes driven oppositely past each other .      regarding sedimentation , fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram3 ] , the whole phase diagram exhibits _ only _ three different phases . for volume fractions @xmath100 we do not find lane formation for all inverse screening length studied . for increasing volume fractions and strong electrostatic interactions , @xmath101 , first the square lattice at @xmath102 , that is also present in the previous two situations ,",
    "is recovered and then the system reenters a region with no - lanes for @xmath74 .",
    "this behavior nicely illustrates the competition between hydrodynamic interactions disfavoring lanes driven oppositely past each other and the electrostatic interactions favoring a square lattice . only for the small regime around @xmath102 the electrostatics",
    "succeeds the hydrodynamic interactions and enforces a square lattice . for all other volume fractions laning",
    "is destroyed .",
    "however , for stronger salt concentrations , where the coulombic coupling is reduced , we discover a situation that is not present in the previous situations ( a ) and ( b ) , namely a region in which only two big completely separated lanes .",
    "we call this state _ phase separated_. in that case the long ranged hydrodynamic interactions prescribe the structure and the short ranged yukawa interaction plays its role only at the rough interface of the two phases . from our simulations we conclude the lanes are separated by half of the box length .",

    "a further interesting feature is that curves for ( a ) and ( b ) intersect between @xmath98 and @xmath80 and that the screened hydrodynamic interaction enhance the drift velocity for larger inverse screening length .",

    "hydrodynamic interactions were included on the rotne - prager level .",
    "for an electric field , the leading oseen term is screened due to the presence of counterions .",
    "the latter fact has lead to very similar steady state phase diagrams for an electric field as a driving source than that in the simple case of neglected hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "various steady state were obtained as a function of the colloidal density and the range of the interaction .",
    "they can qualitatively be understood in terms of a competition of the mutual coulomb attraction and friction of sliding lanes . at high densities",
    "the lateral structure is crystalline , the crystal is either triangular as dictated by packing at high densities and high screening or square - like at low - screening which minimizes the coulomb attractive energy . on the other hand , in sedimentation where the two colloidal species have the same buoyant mass",
