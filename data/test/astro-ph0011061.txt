    "the @xmath0dor stars constitute a new class of pulsating variables that was discovered only recently .",
    "krisciunas ( @xcite ) and zerbi ( @xcite ) review the history of the discovery and the current observational status of this group of variables .",
    "we refer to these papers for a general introduction on @xmath0dor stars , but we mention here that these objects are thought to exhibit multiperiodic high - order g - mode pulsations with periods in the range of 0.5 - 3 days .",
    "much effort is currently made to find new members of this group , in order to constrain their pulsational characteristics and their position in the hrdiagram .",
    "this is especially relevant since the subject of the precise excitation mechanism is not yet settled .",
    "promising theoretical models are currently being worked out .",
    "no direct confrontation between the new theoretical ideas about the driving and the observational status has been performed yet , one of the reason being that the number of _ bona fide _ members is still low and that these stars have quite a large variety in their observational behaviour .",
    "we already performed a systematic detection and classification of @xmath0dor stars from the hipparcos periodic annex using the geneva photometric system .",
    "the method used was a multivariate discriminant analysis and it led to the discovery of 14 new @xmath0dor candidates ( aerts et al . ) .",
    "moreover , handler ( @xcite ) , searching for new @xmath0dor stars in the hipparcos catalogues of the periodic and unsolved variables , found respectively 13 and 18 new `` prime '' @xmath0dor candidates which are non - redundant with other studies .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect.2 , we present the obtained data from the geneva photometry , and compare it to the hipparcos photometry . in sect.3 , we search for periodic behaviour in the data . in sect.4",
    ", we present the spectra of the stars .",
    "finally , we end with some conclusions in sect.5 .",
    "the content of the geneva catalogue is the union of more than 200 scientific programmes , including all stars in the bright star catalogue south of @xmath2 .",
    "the geneva photometric database now contains 344  500 measurements of 47  600 stars .",
    "there are seven filters , namely u , b , v , b1 , b2 , v1 , g. during the reduction scheme , a weight is assigned to each measurement and the noise level of single measurements with the weights 3 or 4 for the v band is about 4 to 5 milli - magnitudes . for the article , we take the intermediate value of 4.5 milli - magnitudes .",
    "we started a search in the geneva photometric database for @xmath0dor candidates .",
    "we selected in the geneva catalogue f0-f9 stars which fitted the observational window and with a high dispersion , @xmath3 .",
    "the eleven chosen candidates were monitored with the p7 photometer attached to the 70 cm swiss telescope at la silla observatory .",
    "we here report our analyses of the new photometric data .",
    "generally , we disregarded the very few measurements that already existed of the programmed stars in the geneva database and used only the data taken during the dedicated campaigns .",
    "these consist from 2 to 7 runs of each 3 weeks , during which each star was observed typically twice per night . the total time span of the data varies between 1 to 5 years with a mean of 2 years .",
    "the geneva photometry permits an accurate determination of temperature @xmath4 , gravity @xmath5 , and metallicity [ m / h ] . in table",
    "[ tab : anphys ] we list the physical properties of our 11 stars derived from the knzli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) calibrations .",
    "the errors given are the ones resulting from the interpolation in the tables of standard stars .",
    "they are only valid assuming that the average colours are free from errors .",
    "the standard errors should therefore not be considered as physical error estimates .",
    "our targets are in general slightly metal weak and some are just slightly hotter than the sun .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the more thoroughly the candidates were studied the more they were rejected .",
    "we end therefore with a shorter list of @xmath0dor stars . establishing such a list",
    "needs strong efforts , but it is important for describing precisely the physical properties of this pulsating star group .",
    "we have found three new @xmath0doradus stars ( hd12901 , hd48501 , hd26298 ) . one of them ( hd12901 ) was indicated by handler ( @xcite ) to have a possible @xmath6scuti behaviour on the basis of hipparcos data .",
    "our geneva photometry , however , clearly points towards multiple periods longer than those of @xmath6scuti stars and in the region expected for @xmath0doradus stars .",
    "hd48501 is also a multiperiodic variable .",
    "the line - profile variability of these three new @xmath0dor stars will be discussed in a separate paper .",
    "it is presently important to find as many confirmed @xmath0doradus stars as possible , in order to constrain the suggested theoretical excitation models . in particular",
    ", the question remains whether or not the @xmath0doradus phenomenon only occurs for f0  f2 type stars or also for much cooler objects as suggested by aerts et al .",
    "( ) . if the latter is true , then it is tempting to assume that the @xmath0doradus stars may exhibit simultaneously opacity - driven g - modes and stochastically excited solar - like p - modes .",
    "the occurrence of both such types of pulsations would broaden the interest for the stars because they would become unique objects for seismology . in this respect , the search for solar - like oscillations in bright selected @xmath0doradus stars by future seismology space missions , such as most , mons and corot , would be extremely valuable .",
