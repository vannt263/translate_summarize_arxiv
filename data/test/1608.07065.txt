    "phase transitions in non - equilibrium systems have been investigated in detail in past two decades .",
    "one of the earliest , most extensively studied and most commonly observed non - equilibrium transition is the transition to an absorbing state .",
    "it is often described by directed percolation ( dp ) universality class .",
    "grassberger and la torre established equivalence of reggeon field theory with markov process .",
    "this was followed by janssen and grassberger s conjecture that all transitions to nondegenerate absorbing state in one - component systems without quenched disorder , with short range interactions in space and time , and in absence of multi - critical points are in dp universality class . by now , we know several systems in this universality class .",
    "@xcite    there are very few systems which are unambiguously shown to be in an universality class different from dp .",
    "systems such as branching and annihilating random walks with even number of offsprings ( bawe ) @xcite , model a and b of probabilistic cellular automata@xcite , interacting monomer - dimer models @xcite and nonequilibrium kinetic ising model in presence of spin flip as well as spin exchange dynamics @xcite are found to be in directed ising ( di ) universality class@xcite .",
    "voter universality class , parity conserving class ( which has same exponents as di in 1-d ) and absorbing phase transitions with conserved field are such examples@xcite .",
    "compact directed percolation is another such class@xcite .",
    "models such as manna model were considered to be in different universality class .",
    "however , questions have been raised on the independent manna class@xcite .",
    "special boundary conditions , quenched disorder and anomalous diffusion affect the exponents@xcite . in this work , we study a process known as pair contact process with diffusion ( pcpd ) which has been reported to be possibly in an independent universality class using an alternative order parameter .",
    "a model with infinite absorbing states called pair contact process ( pcp ) did attract lot of attention",
    ". in pcp , particles in two neighboring occupied sites can annihilate each other with probability @xmath2 and produce an offspring with probability @xmath3 .",
    "any state without pairs is an absorbing state .",
    "infinity of such states are possible . despite not obeying sufficient conditions for dp universality class ,",
    "this transition is considered to be in dp universality class@xcite .    a variant of pcp known as pair contact process with diffusion ( pcpd ) attracted even more attention .",
    "the universality class of this transition in 1-d has been a matter of long - standing debate and the issue is not yet settled .",
    "( for further generalization , see @xcite . ) initially , it was seen as process in a distinctly new universality class @xcite .",
    "but , several alternatives were proposed in later studies on this model ( see sec .",
    "i of @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most plausible arguments for pcpd being in dp class was given by hinrichsen .",
    "he argued that isolated particles can spread at most diffusively with dynamic exponent 2 .",
    "but most of the estimates of dynamic exponent of pcpd yield value less than 2 implying a superdiffusive spread of critical clusters .",
    "hence the asymptotic behaviour should not be dominated by diffusion of isolated particles which are effectively frozen .",
    "if the isolated particles are frozen pcpd reduces to pcp which belongs to dp universality class@xcite .",
    "the model shows very strong corrections to scaling . in such cases",
    ", it is argued that ` very large scale and long - time computations in future will help us to settle on an appropriate conclusion ' .",
    "this approach of longer and longer simulations on larger and larger systems has been addressed to some extent in recent decade and simulation time has reached @xmath4 recent paper by park@xcite .",
    "he has concluded that on including corrections to scaling , the critical density decay exponent is @xmath5 independent of diffusion constant .",
    "thus this model is incompatible with dp universality class .",
    "barkema and coworkers argue that the model is in same universality class as dp by considering scaling of ratio of pair density and particle density@xcite and assuming certain corrections to scaling . due to strong corrections to scaling , there is a debate even about critical density decay exponent . on the theoretical side ,",
    "this problem has resisted analysis and the latest work by gredat _",
    "et al _ in which pcpd has been studied by nonperturbative functional renormalization group has suggested that ` critical behavior of pcpd can be either in dp or a in a new ( conjugated ) class'@xcite .",
    "the numerical studies on scaling of order parameter and theoretical studies have not reached a conclusive end .",
    "hence , there is a need for an alternative approach .",
    "we work on a model which reaches pcpd in certain limit and dp in another limit .",
    "critical density decay exponent @xmath6 for dp is known to be 0.1595 while that for pcpd has ranged from 0.17 - 0.275 @xcite and the latest estimate is as low as 0.17 @xcite .",
    "thus the difference between exponents ( if any ) is very small .",
    "the value of exponents is very small as well .",
    "it takes very long for system to settle into saturation state and time grows with system size .",
    "the static exponents which differ in magnitude much more are difficult to compute .",
    "for example , if we work on modest system size of 5 @xmath7 @xmath8 lattice sites , it will need @xmath9 time steps before the number density goes to zero at critical point .",
    "thus for a small @xmath6 , very long simulations become necessary at large sizes . in presence of strong corrections to scaling , even these simulations do not give reliable results .",
    "other parameters such as pair density decay in a similar manner and they can help in correcting the corrections to scaling .",
    "we attempt an alternative order parameter which decays much faster .",
    "unfortunately , a larger decay exponent brings in its own difficulties such as larger relative error and difficulty in computing static exponents .    in this work ,",
    "we attempt to find indications of universality and scaling behavior from short - time behavior check for alternative ` order parameter ' .",
    "recently , there have been attempts to quench the system from high temperature to critical temperature , study its short time dynamics and analyze its relation with the universality class@xcite .",
    "there have been some successful attempts at obtaining critical exponents from scaling behavior of persistence@xcite which is again short - time history dependent behavior .",
    "we study persistence in pcpd and its generalized version from this point of view .",
    "persistence is a generalization of first passage time for spatially extended systems . in spin systems ,",
    "local persistence at time @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the fraction of sites which did not change their initial spin state at all times @xmath12 . in ising type systems , it may show power law decay in time at zero temperature and exponent is called persistence exponent . in contact processes , persistence may show power law at critical point and the exponent is called persistence exponent@xcite .",
    "the persistence exponents themselves are not universal and depend on delicate details of evolution .",
    "models falling in same universality class have the same persistence exponent in some cases , but not necessarily so . for example , persistence exponent of widely different models such as 1-d ising model , coupled logistic maps and sznajid model is @xmath13@xcite .",
    "similarly , it has been observed the persistence exponent in 1-d dp models such as domany kinzel model@xcite , ziff - gulari - barshad model @xcite , site percolation@xcite and 1-d coupled circle maps @xcite is same , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath14 or very close to it . in ref .",
    "@xcite , they carried out work on 2-d dp model and claimed that persistence exponent is superuniversal .",
    "now there is reasonable evidence that persistence exponent is not even universal@xcite .",
    "its value may be of interest from the viewpoint of detailed dynamics .",
    "we argue that even if persistence exponent is not universal , it can help in finding other universal exponents .",
    "this nontrivial exponent sheds further light on detailed dynamical nature of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , its scaling behavior also sheds light on other exponents in the system .",
    "some examples are as follows a)fuchs _ et al _ studied 1 + 1 dimensional contact process in dp class , and obtained a successful data collapse of persistence for finite size scaling as well as off - critical simulations using 1-d dp values of @xmath1 and @xmath0@xcite .",
    "b ) the onset of spatiotemporal intermittency in coupled circle maps is known to be in dp universality class .",
    "finite size scaling of persistence yields estimate of @xmath0 which matches with 1-d dp value@xcite .",
    "c ) hinrichsen and koduvely studied persistence in domany - kinzel automata and found that persistence obeys finite size scaling with same exponents as dp@xcite .",
    "d ) an evolutionary model of prisoner s dilemma on 2-d lattice is found to show a transition in dp universality class .",
    "two variants of this model have been studied and @xmath15 obtained from off critical simulations of persistence in this model match with 2-d dp values@xcite .",
    "e ) manoj and ray obtained finite - size scaling collapse of persistence in glauber - ising model in dimensions 1 - 4 @xcite at zero temperature .",
    "thus there are few cases where transition is known and the scaling collapse for persistence is obtained by using standard values .",
    "we try this approach towards this problem and try to complete the study . local persistence in this model",
    "is not studied before .",
    "we study a model called gpcpd ( generalized pair contact process with diffusion ) which smoothly interpolates between dp and pcpd with a parameter controlling memory strength @xcite .",
    "we compute the persistence exponent for this model which is a new nontrivial critical exponent unrelated to other critical exponents .",
    "apart from completing studies by determining persistence exponent , the studies can be used for validation of other critical exponents , particularly when studies on order parameter have not been conclusive . as mentioned above ,",
    "there have been four prior cases in which persistence in 1-d and 2-d dp models has been studied and finite size scaling and off - critical scaling in these models give an estimate of @xmath0 and @xmath1 which agrees with standard dp models .",
    "we observe a fairly convincing scaling in gpcpd using this approach and determine scaling exponents in this manner . in this model , for limiting case of dp , we indeed get scaling exponents close to those for dp .",
    "thus it is fair to expect that if pcpd were in dp class , dp scaling for persistence should prevail in finite size scaling as well as off - critical simulations .",
    "our basic result is that while @xmath0 varies continuously as reported by noh and park , the correlation - time exponent @xmath1 matches with dp for gpcpd .",
    "noh and park introduced an extra free parameter @xmath16 controlling memory . in this model ,",
    "if pair of occupied sites is chosen , it can either lead to creation of one more particle with some probability , or both particles can be annihilated with certain probability . if this was the only dynamics , the state with no pairs is an absorbing state and such a transition is known to be in dp class . however , picture changes if we allow particles to diffuse . for nonzero diffusion",
    ", we has two absorbing states .",
    "apart from vacuum state , we have a state with single diffusing particle .",
    "such state is not unique .",
    "it can be termed as @xmath17 dimensional absorbing subspace to which particle is confined .    the pair density in this model can change due to diffusion which leads to long - term memory .",
    "the pair created at some time due to diffusion can proliferate and lead to extra particle after a very long time .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 controls creation of diffusion - induced pairs .",
    "the simulation is carried out in following manner .",
    "consider a 1-d lattice of @xmath18 sites with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a pair of sites @xmath19 and @xmath20 is randomly selected .",
    "if both sites occupied , the particles are annihilated with probability @xmath21 or a particle is added to a neighboring @xmath22 or @xmath23th site with probability @xmath24 provided neighboring site is empty .",
    "if only one of the @xmath19 and @xmath20th site is occupied , the occupied particle hops to other site with probability @xmath25 .",
    "if hopping solitary particle creates a pair by coming in contact with site occupied by a particle , both particles are annihilated with probability @xmath26 as mentioned before .",
    "one time - step is completed after @xmath18 such trials . in short ,",
    "if diffusion leads to formation of particle pair , such pair is annihilated with probability @xmath26 . for @xmath27 , such pair",
    "is certainly annihilated and diffusion does not increase number of particle pairs . for @xmath27 , when the system reaches an absorbing state of pcp , _ i.e. _ there are no consecutive occupied sites , the dynamics thereafter is just diffusion . if this diffusion leads to particle pairs the particles are annihilated and the final absorbing state can be a vaccum state or a solitary particle .",
    "the number of absorbing states is not infinite for @xmath27 case as it is for @xmath28 case .",
    "but the absorbing state for @xmath27 case is same as that for pcp since the dynamics thereafter is plain diffusion . in this case",
    ", it is reasonable to expect that the transition is in dp class @xcite . for @xmath29",
    ", diffusion occurs independently and can change the number of particle pairs .",
    "this case is equivalent to pcpd .",
    "noh and park relate the additional parameter @xmath16 introduced by them to memory since if diffusing particles can lead to particle pairs , pair - creation rate will be history dependent",
    ". this history dependence will not be there if the diffusing particles certainly annihilate on meeting .",
    "noh and park have reported accurate critical points at which transition is observed for @xmath30 .",
    "the values are @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath29 . for @xmath29 an improved value @xmath34 has been reported by park@xcite .",
    "they investigated pair density and systematically found values of all exponents for various values of @xmath16 .",
    "they found continuously varying exponent for various values of @xmath16 .",
    "we are not aware of any further theoretical or numerical studies in gpcpd after noh and park s work .",
    "we investigate this problem using persistence as ` order parameter ' .",
    "we define persistent sites at time @xmath10 as ones which did not change their initial state at all time steps @xmath12 .",
    "we find that the asymptotic persistence is zero for @xmath35 .",

    "this change is not reflected in @xmath0 which saturates for large value of @xmath0 .",
    "obtaining good statistics for saturation values of @xmath40 for larger @xmath18 is made difficult due to the fact that @xmath67 . if @xmath68(say ) , and 4@xmath69 sites were persistent for @xmath70 , @xmath71 sites will be persistent for @xmath72 and number of persistent sites for @xmath72 will be 4 again .",

    "noh and park conjectured that it is possible that gpcpd is in same class with further variation due to extra free parameter @xmath16 .",
    "however , the idea of continuously varying exponents is not very compatible with classical idea of universality which leads to few exponents depending on dimensionality and symmetries@xcite .",
    "recent works in pcpd have suggested a clear drift of exponents toward dp values for long - time simulations .",
