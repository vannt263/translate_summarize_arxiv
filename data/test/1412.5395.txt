    "the theory of qcd presents many interesting challenges , not least of which that the underlying dynamics described in terms of quarks and gluons is obscurred by the process of hadronization . in this direction ,",
    "meson spectroscopy remains an interesting topic especially in light of belle , babar and bes , where a wealth of new states have been discovered and warrant investigation .    in this work we focus on the functional approach , namely dyson ",
    "schwinger equations ( dses ) and bethe  salpeter equations ( bses ) . by extending the formalism to include mesons with higher angular momentum  @xcite",
    ", we can make predictions for states with @xmath0 in the light and heavy quark sector  @xcite .",
    "this enables the investigation of regge trajectories in this approach for the first time .",
    "the starting point are the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) , the corresponding solutions of which are the one - particle irreducible green s functions . throughout this paper",
    "we employ the rainbow - ladder approach , a widely used truncation that preserves the chiral nature of the pion .",
    "the dressed quark propagator , @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the quark wave function and @xmath3 its mass function , is obtained by solution of its dse @xmath4 which we have already specialised to the case of rainbow - ladder by combining the dressed gluon propagator and quark - gluon vertex to form an effective one - gluon exchange model with effective coupling @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the bare propagator is @xmath6 , with bare quark mass @xmath7 related to the renormalized one via @xmath8 and the renormalisation factors @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11 is the usual color casimir .    for our effective interaction",
    "we employ the frequently used model of maris and tandy  @xcite .",
    "this consists of an ultraviolet part that guarantees agreements with one - loop resummed perturbation theory , and an infrared term whose integrated strength triggers dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it has the form @xmath12}\\ ; , % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with momenta @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "typically @xmath16 is constrained in the light quark sector to be equal to @xmath17 in order to set the scale of an non - pertubative interaction such , that the pion mass and leptonic decay constant are reproduced correctly . in order to incorporate flavor dependence",
    ", the @xmath18 parameter differs in the effective interaction for light and heavy hadron states .",
    "bound states of a quark and an antiquark are described by the bethe ",
    "salpeter equation for the corresponding bethe ",
    "salpeter amplitude @xmath19 @xmath20 = \\lambda(p_i^2 ) 4\\pi z_2 ^ 2 c_f \\int \\frac{d^4k}{(2\\pi)^4 }                                    \\gamma^\\mu \\left[s_+\\gamma(k;p)s_-\\right ] \\gamma^\\nu ( \\delta_{\\mu\\nu } - k_\\mu k_\\nu / k^2 ) \\ , \\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{eff}}(k^2)}{k^2}\\ , .",
    "% \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation can be seen as an eigenvalue problem , whose solutions @xmath21 found at @xmath22 form a discrete spectrum .",
    "the quantum numbers of the meson follow from the covariant structure of @xmath19 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : spectrumnn ] we show the resulting spectrum for @xmath23 mesons . with the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath18 to be adjusted such , that the pion mass is fixed to experimental value , the ground state mass in the vector channel @xmath24 agrees with experimental value .",
    "however , further on the spectra , for the scalar and axialvector states we see a significant deviation in masses .",
    "nevertheless , the situation greatly improves for the two tensor channels with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "it is apparent that the sequence of ground states lying on the regge trajectory with quantum numbers @xmath27 is in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the physical interpretation of this is as follows : in the scalar and axial - vector states the tensor force plays a significant role , but for the @xmath28 states by contrast it is vanishing or small , whereas the spin - orbit forces are dominant . translating our observation to a naive quark model picture , we conclude that in the rainbow - ladder truncation the analogue of the tensor force is not sufficient .",
    "the @xmath29 spectrum is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrumss ] .",
    "as before one observes a similar picture in that the sequence @xmath27 agrees fairly well with experiment .",
    "however the pseudoscalar @xmath29-state is too light because effects from the @xmath30 anomaly  @xcite are not taken into account . in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 channels ,",
    "we closely reproduce the experimental values for the @xmath33 and the @xmath34 .            for the charmonium sector",
    "the @xmath35 and @xmath36 states masses were used to fix the two model parameters , @xmath18 and the quark mass .",
    "the remaining spectrum can be viewed as predictions .",
    "in addition to the ground states , we observe a good agreement for excited states in the scalar and vector channel .",
    "the masses of @xmath37 and @xmath38 states coincide with experiment within a @xmath39 percent accuracy .",
    "even the third state in vector channel , the @xmath40 , is nicely represented .",
    "unfortunately any further excitations are unreachable due to the non - analytic structure of the quark dressing functions at large @xmath41 , as well as the onset of the @xmath42-threshold .",
    "similarly , for bottomonium the spectrum , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bottom ] , is also very well represented for the ground - states , agreeing well with experimental data .",
    "note that the @xmath18-parameter was changed to @xmath43 in comparison to a charmonium calculation , in order to take into account the intrinsic flavour dependence of the quark - gluon interaction  @xcite .",
    "further , we apply an observation made in light quark sector , that the channels @xmath44 ( the natural regge trajectory ) are well described by the rainbow - ladder truncation , to predict the charmonium and bottomonium @xmath45-state .",
    "we find @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the result agrees with the quark model prediction  @xcite and the lattice qcd results @xcite .",
    "finally , we extract the parameters of the regge - trajectory given by @xmath48 , with the slope parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 given in table  [ tab : regge ] . that we obtain regge behaviour",
    "is intriguing , because the model that we employ can not ( directly ) be related to a linear rising quark potential .",
    ".parameters of regge trajectories for @xmath23 , @xmath29 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 mesons with natural parity .",
    "[ tab : regge ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we presented a calculation of the spectra of light and heavy mesons within within the rainbow - ladder truncation using a well - established effective interaction .    in the light quark sector , the results are reliable on the five percent level for channels where tensor force does not play a dominant role , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath53 . as a result",
    ", we find that the associated regge trajectory agrees with experiment .",
    "since our approach does not incorporate a linear rising potential , it is unexpected that we observe regge trajectories .",
    "this fact may cast some doubts on the naive interpretation of regge - behavior .    in the case of heavy quarkonia , for spectrum of charmonia and bottomonia we obtained good results , as for ground states as well as for first and second radial excitations in the scalar and vector channels . for the tensor states @xmath45 we have enough confidence in our calculation to make a prediction since it lies on the natural regge trajectory @xmath27 and is therefore well suited to the rainbow - ladder interaction .",
    "however , the comparison with experiment highlights the necessity to extend this framework beyond that of rainbow - ladder .",
    "there are a several ways to approaches in this direction : to take into account the effects of the gluon self - interaction @xcite , pion cloud @xcite or through modelling the quark - gluon vertex beyond the leading @xmath54  @xcite .",
