    "the study of the formation of population iii stars in a cosmological context via high - resolution simulations is becoming a mature discipline , with multiple groups finding similar results ( bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ; bromm & loeb 2004 ; abel , bryan , & norman 2002 ; oshea & norman 2007 ; yoshida et  al .",
    "2006b ; gao et  al .",
    "however , all of these calculations operate under a common fundamental assumption  namely , the absence of an ultraviolet background . given the abundance of halos in which population iii stars would form and the general consensus that these stars must be massive , one expects that , though only a small fraction of the volume of the universe would be ionized , a significant background of ultraviolet radiation in the lyman - werner ( lw ) band ( 11.18 - 13.6 ev ) , which is capable of photodissociating molecular hydrogen , would be present for the formation of the bulk of population iii stars ( omukai 2001 ; yoshida et  al .",
    "2003 ; machacek , bryan , & abel 2001 ; wise & abel 2005 ) .",
    "given that atomic hydrogen is optically thin to this radiation and that it easily destroys molecular hydrogen , this could have a significant impact on the formation of primordial stars .",
    "( 2001 ) used cosmological amr simulations to study the formation of primordial stars in the presence of a soft uv background , and later including an x - ray background ( machacek , bryan , & abel 2003 ) .",
    "they found that the lw background delays the formation of population iii stars and shifts halo formation to higher masses .",
    "however , their calculations were not of sufficiently high resolution to give any significant information about the formation of the protostellar cloud at the core of each collapsing cosmological halo .",
    "( 2003 ) performed a suite of large sph simulations of high redshift structure formation , including two calculations with a soft uv background with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mean intensity of the uv background in the lw band in units of @xmath9  erg s@xmath10  @xmath11  hz@xmath10  sr@xmath10 .",
    "they found that gas cooling is suppressed in the higher lw background case , and predicted that star formation would not occur . on the other hand , & haiman ( 2002 ) showed analytically that primordial gas in halos with t@xmath12  k can still collapse to high densities in the presence of a strong molecular hydrogen - dissociating background via atomic hydrogen line radiation , and can eventually form h@xmath13 .",
    "they referred to these objects as  second generation objects \" in the sense that although still of primordial composition , their formation pathway is different from the first stars .",
    "an issue that needs to be addressed concerns the mode of primordial star formation in halos with t@xmath5  k and above .",
    "it is apparent from recent studies using large numbers of simulations that smaller halos , with masses of @xmath14  m@xmath15 , appear to always form primordial stars in isolation  ( gao et  al .",
    "2006 ; oshea & norman 2007 ) .",
    "is this still the case in halos whose masses are an order of magnitude or more larger ? does a single primordial star form , or several ?",
    "this is particularly relevant given that many semi - analytic models of structure formation that follow the chemical evolution of structures at high redshift ( scannapieco et  al .",
    "2005 ; schneider et  al .",
    "2006 ) suggest that halos of this scale which have not been enriched by metals ( and thus will form primordial stars ) exist up to at least @xmath16 .",
    "if this is true , there is expected to be a strong photodissociating background at that time  ( yoshida et  al .",
    "2003 ; wise & abel 2005 ) .",
    "this paper is the second in a series . in & norman ( 2007 )",
    "( hereafter referred to as paper i ) , we examined several aspects of population iii star formation in a @xmath17cdm universe , in the absence of an ultraviolet background which photodissociates molecular hydrogen . in this paper , we study population iii star formation in a single cosmological realization varying the strength of the lw background , with the goal of investigating the effect that this background has on the evolution and properties of gas in the halo core ( at radii @xmath18  pc ) and the ultimate fate of the gas at the center of t@xmath5  k halos .",
    "we use a single cosmological realization , varying the strength of the photodissociating background over the range suggested by   & abel ( 2005 ) , and look for the cutoff in population iii star formation suggested by   ( 2003 ) .    in agreement with the findings of ( machacek et  al .",
    "2001 ) , we find that the addition of a photodissociating background results in a delay of the collapse of high density gas at the center of the most massive halo in the simulation and , as a result , an increase in the virial mass of this halo at the onset of baryon collapse .",
    "we find that , contrary to the results of   ( 2003 ) , star formation is not suppressed for j@xmath0 , but occurs even with backgrounds as high as j@xmath1 .",
    "we find that 2 cooling leads to collapse despite the depressed halo core molecular hydrogen fractions f@xmath19 by two multiplicative effects : ( 1 ) the elevated 2 cooling rates per molecule at @xmath2 k , and ( 2 ) time .",
    "we find that halo core collapse occurs in the usual way once the gas in the halo core has become dense enough that the cooling time becomes much less than the hubble time .",
    "we also observe a relationship between the strength of the photodissociating background and the rate of accretion onto the evolving protostellar cloud core , with higher lw background fluxes resulting in higher accretion rates .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the suppression of molecular hydrogen formation ( and thus suppression of cooling ) by the photodissociating background , as well as the higher virial temperatures of the more massive halos at the epoch of collapse .",
    "this may have implications for the range of population iii stellar masses . finally , we find that the collapsing halo cores in our simulations do not fragment at densities below @xmath3  @xmath4 regardless of the strength of the soft uv background , suggesting that population iii stars forming in halos with t@xmath5  k may still form in isolation .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ methodology ]",
    "we provide a description of enzo , the code used to perform the calculations in this paper and of the simulation setup .",
    "the results from our simulations are presented in sections  [ results.meanprop ] through [ results.rephalos ] : section  [ results.meanprop ] discusses some of the mean halo properties observed in the calculations , section  [ results.evolution ] discusses the evolution of the halo core prior to collapse , section  [ results.collapse ] compares spherically - averaged halo properties for all simulations at the epoch of collapse , section  [ results.fixred ] discusses a variety of halo properties at a fixed redshift , and section  [ results.rephalos ] compares the evolution of two representative simulations taken from our ensemble . in section  [ sect.issues ]",
    "we discuss neglected physics and possible numerical issues , and in section  [ discuss ] we discuss some of the results presented in this work and their implications .",
    "finally , we present a summary of the main results in section  [ summary ] .",
    "` enzo ' is a publicly available , extensively tested adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) cosmology code developed by greg bryan and others ( bryan & norman 1997a , 1997b ; norman & bryan 1999 ; oshea et  al .",
    "2004 , 2005b ) .",
    "the specifics of the enzo code are described in detail in these papers ( and references therein ) , but we present a brief description here for clarity .    the enzo code couples an n - body particle - mesh ( pm ) solver ( efstathiou et  al . 1985 ; hockney & eastwood 1988 ) used to follow the evolution of a collisionless dark matter component with an eulerian amr method for ideal gas dynamics by & colella ( 1989 ) , which allows high dynamic range in gravitational physics and hydrodynamics in an expanding universe . this amr method ( referred to as _ structured _ amr )",
    "utilizes an adaptive hierarchy of grid patches at varying levels of resolution .",
    "each rectangular grid patch ( referred to as a `` grid '' ) covers some region of space in its _ parent grid _ which requires higher resolution , and can itself become the parent grid to an even more highly resolved _",
    "child grid_. enzo s implementation of structured amr places no fundamental restrictions on the number of grids at a given level of refinement , or on the number of levels of refinement .",
    "however , owing to limited computational resources it is practical to institute a maximum level of refinement , @xmath20 .",
    "additionally , the enzo amr implementation allows arbitrary integer ratios of parent and child grid resolution , though in general for cosmological simulations ( including the work described in this paper ) a refinement ratio of 2 is used .",
    "since the addition of more highly refined grids is adaptive , the conditions for refinement must be specified . in enzo",
    ", the criteria for refinement can be set by the user to be a combination of any or all of the following : baryon or dark matter overdensity threshold , minimum resolution of the local jeans length , local density gradients , local pressure gradients , local energy gradients , shocks , and cooling time . a cell reaching any or all of the user - specified criteria",
    "will then be flagged for refinement .",
    "once all cells of a given level have been examined , rectangular solid boundaries are determined which minimally encompass the flagged cells on that level . a refined grid patch",
    "is then introduced within each such bounding volume , and the results are interpolated to a higher level of resolution .    in enzo , resolution of the equations being solved is adaptive in time as well as in space .",
    "the timestep in enzo is satisfied on a level - by - level basis by finding the largest timestep such that the courant condition ( and an analogous condition for the dark matter particles ) is satisfied by every cell on that level .",
    "all cells on a given level are advanced using the same timestep .",
    "once a level @xmath21 has been advanced in time @xmath22 , all grids at level @xmath23 are advanced , using the same criteria for timestep calculations described above , until they reach the same physical time as the grids at level @xmath21 . at this point grids at level @xmath23 exchange baryon flux information with their parent grids ,",
    "providing a more accurate solution on level @xmath21 .",
    "cells at level @xmath23 are then examined to see if they should be refined or de - refined , and the entire grid hierarchy is rebuilt at that level ( including all more highly refined levels ) .",
    "the timestepping and hierarchy rebuilding processes are repeated recursively on every level to the maximum existing grid level in the simulation .",
    "two different hydrodynamic methods are implemented in enzo : the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) ( woodward & colella 1984 ) , which was extended to cosmology by ( 1995 ) , and the hydrodynamic method used in the zeus magnetohydrodynamics code ( stone & norman 1992a , 1992b ) .",
    "we direct the interested reader to the papers describing both of these methods for more information , and note that ppm is the preferred choice of hydro method since it is higher - order - accurate and is based on a technique that does not require artificial viscosity , which smoothes shocks and can smear out features in the hydrodynamic flow .    the chemical and cooling properties of primordial ( metal - free ) gas are followed using the method of ( 1997 ) and ( 1997 ) .",
    "this method follows the non - equilibrium evolution of a gas of primordial composition with 9 total species : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the code also calculates radiative heating and cooling following atomic line excitation , recombination , collisional excitation , free - free transitions , molecular line cooling , and compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background , as well as any of approximately a dozen different models for a metagalactic ultraviolet background that heat the gas via photoionization and/or photodissociation .",
    "we model the cooling processes detailed in   ( 1997 ) , but use the   & palla ( 1998 ) molecular hydrogen cooling function .",
    "the multispecies rate equations are solved out of equilibrium to properly model situations where , e.g. , the cooling time of the gas is much shorter than the hydrogen recombination time .",
    "a total of 9 kinetic equations are solved , including 29 kinetic and radiative processes , for the 9 species mentioned above .",
    "the chemical reaction equation network is technically challenging to solve due to the huge range of reaction time scales involved ; the characteristic creation and destruction time scales of the various species and reactions can differ by many orders of magnitude . as a result ,",
    "the set of rate equations is extremely stiff , and an explicit scheme for integration of the rate equations can be costly if small enough timestep are taken to keep the network stable .",
    "this makes an implicit scheme preferable for such a set of equations , and enzo solves the rate equations using a method based on a backwards differencing formula ( bdf ) in order to provide a stable and accurate solution .",
    "it is important to note the regime in which this chemistry model is valid . according to ( 1997 ) and ( 1997 ) , the reaction network is valid for temperatures between @xmath33 k. the original model discussed in these two references is only valid up to n@xmath34  @xmath4 .",
    "however , addition of the 3-body h@xmath13 formation process allows correct modeling of the gas chemistry up until the point where collisionally induced emission from molecular hydrogen becomes an important cooling processes , which occurs at @xmath35  @xmath4 .",
    "we do not include heating by molecular hydrogen formation , which will be significant at densities of @xmath36  @xmath4 and above , and may affect temperature evolution at these high densities .",
    "a further concern is that the optically thin approximation for radiative cooling breaks down beginning at n@xmath37  @xmath4 . beyond this point ,",
    "modifications to the cooling function that take into account the non - negligible opacity of the gas to line radiation from molecular hydrogen must be made , as discussed by & abel ( 2004 ) . even with these modifications ,",
    "a more correct description of the cooling of gas of primordial composition at high densities will require some form of radiation transport , which will greatly increase the cost of the simulations .",
    "the simulations discussed in this paper are set up in a similar way to those in paper i. a dark matter - only calculation with @xmath38 particles in a three - dimensional simulation volume which is @xmath39  h@xmath10  mpc ( comoving ) on a side is set up at @xmath40 assuming a `` concordance '' cosmological model with no baryons : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) , @xmath45 , and using an eisenstein & hu power spectrum ( eisenstein & hu 1999 ) with a spectral index of @xmath46 .",
    "the cold dark matter cosmological model is assumed .",
    "this calculation is then evolved to @xmath47 using a maximum of four levels of adaptive mesh refinement , refining on a dark matter overdensity of 8.0 . at @xmath47 , the hop halo finding algorithm (",
    "eisenstein & hut 1998 ) is used to find the most massive halo in the simulation .    at this point",
    ", we generate a new set of initial conditions which contain the same large - scale power as the dark matter - only calculation , but include both dark matter and baryons such that the lagrangian volume in which the halo in the dark matter - only calculation formed is resolved at high spatial and mass resolution using a series of static nested grids , with a @xmath38 root grid and three static nested grids , for an overall effective root grid size of @xmath48 cells .",
    "the highest resolution grid is @xmath49 grid cells , and corresponds to a volume @xmath50  h@xmath10 comoving kpc on a side .",
    "the dark matter particles in the highest resolution grid are 14.48  h@xmath10  m@xmath15 and the spatial resolution of the highest resolution grid is 586  h@xmath10 parsecs ( comoving ) .",
    "previous work shows that this particle mass resolution is adequate to fully resolve the collapse of the halo ( abel et  al .",
    "2002 ; oshea & norman 2007 ) .",
    "all simulations are performed using the adaptive mesh cosmology code enzo , which is described in section  [ enzocode ] .",
    "the simulations are started at @xmath40 and allowed to evolve until the collapse of the gas within the center of the most massive halo , assuming the presence of an unevolving soft uv background with intensities in the lyman - werner band of j@xmath51 and  @xmath9  erg s@xmath10  @xmath11  hz@xmath10  sr@xmath10 .",
    "this range covers a much wider range of parameter space than the results described in ( 2001 ) , and completely encompasses the range of possible j@xmath52 values suggested by & abel ( 2005 ) , for a wide range of mean population iii stellar masses .",
    "note that many publications use f@xmath52 instead of j@xmath52 : f@xmath52 has units of erg  s@xmath10  @xmath11  hz@xmath10 , and thus f@xmath53  j@xmath52 .",
    "we will use j@xmath52 throughout this paper , and for convenience express values in units of j@xmath54 , where @xmath8 is the mean intensity of the uv background in the lw band in units of @xmath9  erg s@xmath10  @xmath11  hz@xmath10  sr@xmath10 .",
    "the equations of hydrodynamics are solved using the ppm method with a dual energy formulation , which is required to adequately resolve the thermal properties of gas in high - mach flows . the nonequilibrium chemical evolution and optically thin radiative cooling of the primordial gas",
    "is modeled as described in section  [ enzocode ] , following 9 separate species including molecular hydrogen ( but excluding deuterium ) , with an initial electron fraction of @xmath55 ( which is roughly consistent with ( 1968 ) for an @xmath56 , @xmath57 universe ) .",
    "note that the initial electron fraction in the calculation is relatively unimportant to the molecular hydrogen formation rates in halo cores , as the electron fraction at the center of a given halo is controlled primarily by mergers and the shock formed by accretion of gas onto the halo .",
    "adaptive mesh refinement is used throughout the innermost high resolution region such that cells are refined by factors of two along each axis , with a maximum of 22 total levels of refinement .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum spatial resolution of 115  h@xmath10 au ( comoving ) at the finest level of resolution , with an overall spatial dynamical range of @xmath58 . to avoid effects due to the finite size of the dark matter particles ,",
    "the dark matter density is smoothed on a comoving scale of @xmath59  pc ( which corresponds to @xmath60 0.03 proper pc at @xmath61 ) .",
    "this is reasonable because at that scale in all of our calculations the gravitational potential in the halo of interest is completely dominated by the baryons .",
    "grid cells are adaptively refined based upon several criteria .",
    "we refine on baryon and dark matter overdensities in cells of 4.0 and 8.0 , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum mass of gas or dark matter per cell ( on the most highly refined static grid ) of m@xmath62 and @xmath63  m@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the _ minimummassforrefinementlevelexponent _ parameter is set to @xmath64 for both the dark matter and baryon overdensity refinement criteria , meaning that the mass required to refine to a higher level decreases as a function of increasing level , as :    @xmath65    where l is the current level of refinement .",
    "the negative exponent means that the mass resolution in the calculations is super - lagrangian  for example , m@xmath66  m@xmath67 .",
    "in addition to refining on baryon and dark matter overdensity , these simulations include refinement criteria which ensure that shocks are always well - resolved , that the cooling time in a given cell is always longer than the sound crossing time of that cell , and that the jeans length is always resolved by at least 16 cells .",
    "this last criterion guarantees that the truelove criterion ( truelove et  al .",
    "1997 ) is always resolved by a factor of four more cells in each dimension than is strictly necessary , ensuring that no artificial fragmentation will take place .",
    "figures  [ fig.image_jlw_0 ] and  [ fig.image_jlw_1em21 ] show projections of baryon density and temperature for the j@xmath68 and j@xmath1 calculations , respectively , at the epoch at which each calculation collapses , defined as the redshift at which the baryon number density reaches @xmath69  @xmath4 .",
    "note that due to the rapid evolution of gas at high density , the `` collapse redshift '' depends very weakly on the exact choice of density threshold .",
    "the calculations are started from the same set of initial conditions , and the j@xmath1 calculation is clearly a later stage in the evolution of the j@xmath68 run .",
    "the satellite halos surrounding the primary halo which collapses at z=24.12 in the j@xmath68 run have merged by z=17.32 when the halo in the j@xmath1 case collapses ( cf .",

    "figure  [ fig.halovals1 ] shows that there is a clear relationship between the lw intensity and the collapse redshift and virial mass of the halo .",
    "a larger lw intensity results in a later collapse time and larger virial mass because the halo must be hotter in order to have a cooling time which is less than a hubble time despite the depressed 2 abundance in the high - density gas at the halo s center .",
    "this is discussed further in section  [ results.evolution ] the final mass of the halos in the simulations with j@xmath1 is approximately a factor of 20 higher than that in the `` control '' simulation .",

    "we see that our points for @xmath79 parallel the threshold curve but at a mass approximately four times higher .",
    "this difference can be ascribed to two factors .",
    "first , the threshold mass is the lowest possible halo mass that can collapse , derived from a statistical sample . since we study only one realization which focuses on the most massive halo in the box , its mass is bound to be higher than the statistical minimum .",
    "second , ( 2001 ) s criterion for cooling catches halos at an earlier stage of evolution compared to our data points , which give the halos virial masses at the time of central baryon collapse ( the `` collapse redshift '' ) .",
    "examination of panels ( b ) and ( c ) of figure  [ fig.halovals1 ] show that there is some sort of `` phase change '' between j@xmath80 and @xmath81 causing the halo mass at the time of collapse to increase steeply and non - monotonically .",
    "the collapse redshift steadily decreases as a function of uv increasing background strength ( i.e. collapse of gas at the center of the halo is delayed ) .",
    "however , panel ( c ) shows that the virial mass steadily increases with increasing uv background strength until j@xmath80 , at which point there is a jump in mass by more than a factor of four , above which the halo mass increases only slightly with increasing uv background strength . that something interesting should happen at these lw intensities",
    "is consistent with the findings of   ( 2003 ) who found that 2 cooling is strongly suppressed at j@xmath82 .",
    "they predicted that star formation would be inhibited since the equilibrium 2 fraction is below the critical fraction for cooling derived by ( 1997 ) .",
    "contrary to these predictions , we find collapse not only at j@xmath82 , but also at values as large as j@xmath83 .",
    "we note that highest value considered by ( 2001 ) was j@xmath84 , and the highest simulated by   ( 2003 ) was j@xmath82 .",
    "therefore our cases j@xmath85 have not been examined before , and certainly not at the resolution of our simulations .",
    "how is the gas in the center of these halos able to cool and collapse in such high radiation backgrounds ?",
    "this is analyzed in some detail in the next section .",
    "a hint is provided in ( d ) of figure  [ fig.halovals1 ] , which plots the halo virial temperature as a function of j@xmath52 . at background strengths above j@xmath80 , the virial temperature is consistently approximately @xmath86  k , which is roughly the temperature at which atomic hydrogen cooling is effective .",
    "however , an examination of the radial temperature profiles shows that high - density gas in the center of the halo never reaches these temperatures , but is more typically 2000 k. atomic line cooling is unimportant at such low temperatures ; however the 2 cooling rate per particle is roughly 100 times as large at 2000k as at 500k .",
    "2 cooling still operates in the halo centers despite low 2 abundance due to the higher cooling rates and long evolutionary timescales . in the rest of this section we merely present additional mean properties of the halo and its central region at collapse , and defer discussion of the relevant timescales to section  [ results.evolution ] .     vs. halo collapse redshift .",

    "as described in section  [ sect.simsetup ] , both calculations start from the same initial conditions , with only the strength of the lw background being different .",
    "projections of the log baryon density and temperature for the j@xmath68 and @xmath90 simulations are shown in figures  [ fig.image_jlw_0 ] and  [ fig.image_jlw_1em21 ] , respectively .",
    "these projections are at the epoch of collapse , which is @xmath160  @xmath161 for the j@xmath68  @xmath162 simulation .",
    "the halo masses are significantly different : @xmath163 and @xmath164  m@xmath15 for the two calculations , reflecting the rapid pace of mergers at that redshift , and the amount of structure evolution that takes place over that relatively short time period ( @xmath165 years ) .",
    "this can clearly be seen in the left column of both figures , when the large amount of structure apparent in figure  [ fig.image_jlw_0 ] has merged into the main halo by the time of protostellar cloud formation in the j@xmath1 case , as seen in figure  [ fig.image_jlw_1em21 ] .    despite the differences in evolutionary states , the halos themselves are quite similar in figures  [ fig.image_jlw_0 ] and  [ fig.image_jlw_1em21 ] .",
    "both calculations show halos that are strongly centrally concentrated , as shown by the center column in both figures .",
    "this column shows projections of the halos which are centered on the baryon peak and are approximately one virial radius across ( and thus are scaled differently in both images ) .",
    "no fragmentation of the halo core is visible .",
    "the rightmost panel in both calculations shows the center of the halo , where the protostellar cloud is evolving .",
    "there is still no evidence for fragmentation up to a central baryon density of @xmath3  @xmath4 .",
    "figures  [ fig.radprof_jlw0.1 ] and  [ fig.radprof_jlw1em21.1 ] show the temporal evolution of several spherically - averaged baryon quantities for the j@xmath68 and @xmath90 calculations , respectively .",
    "these plots show baryon number density , enclosed baryon mass , temperature , h@xmath13 fraction , ratio of cooling time to sound crossing time , and ratio of cooling time to dynamical time , as a function of radius , evolving from a number density of @xmath166  @xmath4 to @xmath69  @xmath4 in both calculations .",
    "some qualitative commonalities are obvious between the two calculations .",
    "both halos steadily grow in central density ( panel ( a ) ) , which is coupled to the growing molecular hydrogen fraction in the central region of the halo ( panel ( d ) ) .",
    "both halos collapse quasi - statically , as shown in panels ( e ) and ( f ) .",
    "also , the temperature profiles ( as shown in panel ( c ) ) are broadly similar , in that the gas in the halo central region cools to some minimum value at r @xmath167 pc ( corresponding to n @xmath168  @xmath4 in both simulations ) and then creeps steadily upward as gas collapses to higher densities .",
    "though there are qualitative similarities between the evolution of the two calculations , detailed examination shows some significant quantitative differences .",
    "the time that the halo in the j@xmath68 simulation takes to evolve from a central density of @xmath169  @xmath4 to @xmath135  @xmath4 is @xmath170  myr , with 21 myr of that being the time required to evolve from @xmath169 to n @xmath171 @xmath4 .",
    "the time required for the j@xmath1 calculation to evolve from @xmath169  @xmath4 to @xmath135  @xmath4 is slightly shorter , @xmath60 17 myrs , with 8 myrs required to evolve to n @xmath172  @xmath4 .",
    "the temperature evolution is also somewhat different ",
    "the j@xmath68 simulation has a minimum temperature at r @xmath137 pc of 200 k , with n @xmath171@xmath173 and a molecular hydrogen fraction of @xmath174 , and roughly 1000 m@xmath15 of enclosed gas . as the gas within this radius evolves to higher densities , the temperature increases by a factor of a few , peaking at t @xmath175 k at n  @xmath176  @xmath4 , with f@xmath177 .",
    "the gas cooling time within r @xmath137 pc in the j@xmath68 simulation is always larger than the sound crossing and dynamical times by at least a factor of two , implying a quasistatic gas contraction at all times .",
    "the j@xmath1 simulation evolves somewhat differently .",
    "the collapsing gas reaches a minimum temperature of @xmath178  k at r @xmath179 pc , with a baryon density of @xmath180  @xmath4 , an enclosed gas mass of roughly @xmath86 m@xmath15 , and a molecular hydrogen fraction of @xmath181 , two orders of magnitude below that in the j@xmath68 calculation at the equivalent temperature minimum .",
    "the low h@xmath13 fraction is due to the high lw background radiation flux .",
    "as the halo evolves to higher densities , the gas temperature and h@xmath13 fraction also creep upwards .",
    "the temperature of the gas when the peak reaches roughly @xmath135  @xmath4 is @xmath182 k , with a h@xmath13 fraction of @xmath183 .",
    "the cooling time at r @xmath179 pc is an order of magnitude higher than the sound crossing or dynamical times , implying an extremely slow contraction of the gas at that radius .",
    "as the central density increases , however , the cooling time becomes lower , with t@xmath184/t@xmath185 and t@xmath184/t@xmath186 dipping to @xmath187 at its minimum , but the latter increasing toward the central density peak to a ratio of @xmath188 .",
    "this implies a more rapid contraction of gas in the halo center in the simulation with a higher uv background , despite the lack of molecular hydrogen .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the j@xmath1 calculation has h@xmath13 fractions at n @xmath168 and @xmath106  @xmath4 of @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively , as compared to f@xmath191 and @xmath192 at the same densities in the j@xmath68 calculation .",

    "however , it is possible that they may be relevant in other situations of importance to population iii star formation  in particular , regions which have been ionized to very high electron fractions may experience significant cooling from the hd molecule , which due to its permanent dipole moment makes it more than 100 times more effective as a cooling agent than molecular hydrogen ( per molecule ) , and has the potential to cool gas down to approximately the temperature of the cosmic microwave background , which scales with redshift as @xmath240  k  ( flower et  al .",

    "self - shielding of the photodissociating background by molecular hydrogen in the high - density gas is ignored in these calculations . though this effect could in principle be important , the actual column densities of molecular hydrogen are typically far too small to actually block the soft uv flux . according to ( 2001 ) ( and references therein ) , a column density of @xmath243  @xmath11 is enough for shielding to become important .",
    "however , this was derived for a static distribution of h@xmath13 , while the lw band consists of hundreds of individual lines whose width in this case is dominated by doppler broadening .",
    "it is useful to note in this case that the average line width is @xmath179  km / s and the rms baryon velocity in our calculations are @xmath244  km / s . in order for self - shielding to be important in the case of a turbulent medium",
    ", the column density must be much higher .",
    "typical maximum h@xmath13 column densities in our calculations are on the order of @xmath245  @xmath11 , but these occur late in the collapse of the halo core , and in the highest density regions the cooling and h@xmath13 production times are much shorter than the photodissociation time scale , at which point self - shielding becomes unimportant .",

    "however , as shown by ( 2001 ) , the rate of photodetachment is orders of magnitude smaller than the rate of @xmath29 formation at densities comparable to that found in the centers of the halos examined in this work , and thus the process of @xmath29 photodetachment can be safely ignored .    in this paper",

    "once the gas has collapsed to very high densities , rapid h@xmath13 formation via the 3-body process will occur , essentially independent of the strength of the soft uv background , and the gas will be able to cool down to @xmath249 k very quickly .",

    "the general effect of a higher @xmath250 is to cause structure formation to take place earlier , and thus at a given redshift one would expect significantly more halos in our chosen cosmological model than in the wmap year iii model",
    ". however , the evolution of any single cosmological halo , such as the one examined in this work , is not particularly affected by this parameter in the sense that we are not examining halo stastical properties .",
    "in addition to @xmath250 , the ratio of @xmath251 in our simulations is 0.1337 , while it is @xmath252 in the wmap year iii cosmology .",
    "this may result in some small quantitative differences in , e.g. , the redshift of halo collapse , but should not significantly affect our results .",
    "we direct the reader to paper i for a detailed discussion of other possible numerical issues , such as the generation of cosmological initial conditions , the assumption that the cold dark matter model is correct , the choice of halo in our simulations , and the size of the simulation volumes used .",
    "this paper explores the formation of population iii stars in simulations with a constant soft uv background .",
    "our results agree well qualitatively with that of ( 2001 ) ; we both find that a soft uv background can delay the formation of molecular hydogen , and thus the cooling and collapse , of small ( @xmath253  m@xmath15 ) cosmological halos in which population iii stars form .",
    "we also find that increasing the soft uv background increases the minimum halo mass required for a halo to collapse ( in a way similar to that of smoothing the dark matter power spectrum at small scales  see & norman ( 2006 ) for a discussion ) .",
    "machacek et al .",
    "derived a mass threshold for collapse as a function of the lw background flux that agrees well with our simulations , though the halo masses in our calculation are significantly higher .",
    "this is due to the halo that we examine being a `` typical '' halo rather than at the threshold mass for star formation .",
    "presumably , if we performed these calculations using many halos in a range of cosmological realizations , we would find a minimum halo mass that is somewhat lower than the masses seen in our calculations .",
    "our work is a significant improvement upon that of machacek et al . in some respects ,",
    "as our simulations are much more highly resolved and we examine the evolution of a single halo over a much wider range of soft uv background fluxes .",
    "one drawback of our work compared to machacek et al .",
    "is that we examine the evolution of a single halo , albeit with a broad range of uv backgrounds .",
    "our work is similar to the calculations in   ( 2003 ) which examine population iii star formation in the presence of a photodissociating ultraviolet background .",
    "they find that for values of j@xmath52 above @xmath254  erg s@xmath10  @xmath11  hz@xmath10  sr@xmath10 , hydrogen molecules are rapidly dissociated and gas cooling is inefficient , implying that the collapse of gas in the halo center may be delayed until atomic line cooling dominates , in halos with t@xmath12  k. while we see delays in halo collapse , we do see that a tiny amount of 2 can form even at high fuv background strengths , eventually allowing gas to cool and collapse to high densities without ever reaching temperatures at which atomic line cooling would be effective ( t @xmath255  k ) .",
    "yoshida et al .",
    "make this statement based on a set of simulations using two different values of j@xmath52 ( @xmath254 and @xmath256 ) , which bracket the `` break '' in properties seen in our results .",
    "the simulations used to obtain this result had sph particles with m@xmath257  h@xmath10  m@xmath15 and thus an effective mass resolution comparable to the mass of gas within the quasistatically - collapsing central region of a halo .",
    "our mass resolution is more than two orders of magnitude higher in the center of the cosmological halos that we examine .",
    "the differences between our result and theirs is likely due to the significant differences in resolution and may in fact be consistent once resolution is taken into account .",
    "we see a strong relationship between accretion rates onto the protostellar cloud and the strength of the photodissociating background .",
    "calculations with higher ultraviolet background strengths typically have a larger spherically - averaged baryon accretion rate onto the evolving protostellar cloud .",
    "this is clearly due to variation in halo central temperature relating to the amount of molecular hydrogen existing in the center of the halo at the epoch of collapse .",
    "accretion onto the evolving protostellar cloud is subsonic , and thus regulated by the local sound speed ( which scales as t@xmath258 ) .",
    "this implies some relationship between the strength of the photodissociating background and the final stellar mass of the primordial star  however , the details of this relationship are unclear , and depends on many factors .",
    "for example ,   & palla ( 2003 ) suggest that an increase in accretion rate above @xmath153  m@xmath15/yr will actually result in a _ decrease _ in the final mass of the star due to radiative feedback from the evolving protostar",
    ". however , their results use one - dimenstional , fairly idealized models , and geometrical effects may be important .",
    "this is explored in   & mckee ( 2004 ) , who use a combination of analytic and semi - analytic models of the evolving system .",
    "they suggest that accretion onto the protostar is highly non - spherical , and is in fact mediated by an accretion disk .",
    "they argue that a larger accretion rate onto the disk will lead to a larger star , though with some limitations . finally , ( 2001 ) and",
    "& yoshii ( 2003 ) study the imf of stars that form in t@xmath12  k metal - free protogalaxies in the presence of an h@xmath13 photodissociating background .",
    "they conclude that photodissociation actually decreases the jeans mass of the gas at high densities , and thus reduces the fragmentation mass scale of the clouds and presumably the stellar mass .",
    "they use one - dimensional , spherically symmetric simulations , however .",
    "we can explore this issue in more detail in later calculations , when appropriate models for shielding , cooling via @xmath29 , and more advanced chemistry have been implemented into enzo .",
    "this will be examined in a later paper .",
    "it is worth noting that the range of accretion rates observed in this situation are within the range of rates seen in the @xmath17cdm simulations discussed in paper i. this implies that the mass ranges of the resulting stars will not be significantly different than in the `` standard '' population iii star formation scenario .",
    "we see no fragmentation of the high - density baryon core , up to a baryon number density of @xmath259  @xmath4 , for the entire range of simulations explored in this paper .",
    "this is due to a combination of effects , but predominantly the poor cooling properties of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the gas is relatively hot ( @xmath260 kelvin ) and thus has a high sound speed , which helps to damp out perturbations in the halo center which would otherwise result in multiple fragments .",
    "this effect is exacerbated in simulations with high ultraviolet background strengths , as the temperatures ( and thus the sound speeds ) are generally higher .",
    "this result implies that there is no fundamental change in the mode of population iii star formation as halos grow , and that more massive `` proto - galactic '' halos , with t@xmath261  k , will continue to form a single massive star per halo .",
    "these halos will have a much larger binding energy than the smaller , m @xmath14  m@xmath15 halos which have traditionally been examined by numerical simulations , and implies that multiple generations of star formation may be able to take place in a single halo .",
    "this leads to the possibility of `` self - enrichment , '' where a single population iii star enriches the high - density center of the halo to metallicities high enough to change the cooling properties of the gas .",
    "this could cause a strong change in the imf ( santoro & shull 2006 ; smith & sigurdsson 2007 ) , and these objects could make a significant contribution to the reionization history of the universe  ( mackey , bromm , & hernquist 2003 ; greif & bromm 2006 ) .",
    "we will examine whether the high - density gas in the centers of these more massive halos fragments in a later work .",
    "the values of accretion rates onto the evolving protostellar cloud which are observed with increasing photodissociating background flux ( which are always comparable to those observed in paper i ) , in addition to the apparent lack of fragmentation of gas in the halo center up to densities of n@xmath262  @xmath4 , implies that there is no major change in the mass range of population iii stars as halo masses increase to t@xmath5  k. this is in mild disagreement with previous semianalytic results by & haiman ( 2002 ) and ( 2003 ) .",
    "this is apparently because previous authors assumed that 2 cooling in `` second generation '' ( t@xmath12  k ) objects is unimportant , while we observe that a small 2 fraction , which forms in equilibrium with the uv background , can cool gas effectively to temperatures of @xmath263  k. we do agree with these authors that the majority of primordial star formation will take place in objects with t@xmath5  k , the so - called `` second generation '' objects  ( macintyre , santoro , & thomas 2006 )    our work appears to contradict the results of & bromm ( 2006 ) , who use analytic and semianalytic techniques to follow the collapse of gas within halos of t@xmath264 .",
    "they find that , in their model , gas cools to @xmath265  k via atomic line cooling , and then contracts nearly isothermally to high densities , allowing a molecular hydrogen fraction of f@xmath266 to build up independent of local density and temperature .",
    "the gas in the center of the halo then cools and allows the gas to fragment on scales of @xmath158  m@xmath15 .",
    "we do not see this mode of star formation , possibly because we never generate the significantly ionized halos with t@xmath267  k upon which their scenario depends .",
    "rather , we simulate halos that in the cases of j@xmath0 are built up to t@xmath5  k via mergers , and the gas is never ionized to a significant degree .",
    "one possible reason for the observed differences is that we ignore the formation of deuterium hydride and its effects on the cooling properties of primordial gas .",
    "it is possible that , in some contexts , the inclusion of hd may result in enhanced fragmentation .",
    "this will be examined in future studies .",
    "the scenario described by oh & haiman may still in fact be able to occur , and deserves further detailed numerical study to determine the fate of the collapsing gas and the implications of the ( presumably ) extremely high accretion rates onto the forming protostellar clouds .",
    "our results are similar to those shown by & abel ( 2007 ) , who perform similar simulations examining the collapse of gas in cosmological halos in the presence of a photodissociating background .",
    "they also find that , regardless of the strength of the uv background , the collapse of gas in the centers of the cosmological halos in question still occurs via h@xmath13 cooling .",
    "this holds even for quite extreme examples , such as when the original electron fraction is set to unphysically low levels ( which should suppress h@xmath13 formation , at least temporarily ) .",
    "in this paper we have performed a suite of high dynamical range ( l@xmath268 ) 3d adaptive mesh cosmological simulations of the formation of population iii stars in a @xmath17cdm universe in the presence of a molecular hydrogen photodissocating ( `` lyman - werner '' ) ultraviolet background .",
    "the purpose of these calculations is to understand the effect that the soft ultraviolet background has on the evolution of the gas in collapsing cosmological halos and to determine possible effects on the forming protostellar cloud .",
    "these simulations are all of a single cosmological realization , but with varied ultraviolet background strengths .",
    "our principal results are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "our calculations show that , as the flux of ultraviolet radiation in the lyman - werner band is increased , population iii star formation in a given cosmological halo is delayed to later times and , as a result , an increase in the virial mass of this halo at the onset of baryon collapse .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous work by   ( 2001 ) and   ( 2003 ) .",
    "we find that , contrary to previous work , the formation of primordial stars is never completely suppressed , regardless of the strength of the uv background .",
    "a small amount of molecular hydrogen always exists in cosmological halos , and allows cooling and halo collapse in gas which is bathed in a strong photodissociating background but has not reached @xmath86  k. the previously - suggested mode of star formation in `` second generation '' halos , where the collapse of gas to high density is completely suppressed until cooling can take place via atomic hydrogen line transitions , is never observed in our calculations , which have photodissociating background strengths up to j@xmath1 .    \\3 .",
    "though the molecular hydrogen fraction in the centers of halos which are bathed in strong ( j@xmath0 ) lyman - werner radiation is very small at early times ( f@xmath269 ) , the gas at the center of the halo can still collapse due to the efficient cooling of molecular hydrogen at @xmath270  k , and to the extended time these halos require to collapse compared to halos in the presence of much smaller uv backgrounds .",
    "we observe that the estimated accretion rate onto the forming protostellar cloud varies strongly as a function of j@xmath52 , with simulations that have a stronger ultraviolet background having higher accretion rates .",
    "this is a function of the suppression of molecular hydrogen formation ( and thus suppression of effective cooling ) by the photodissociating background and of the higher virial temperatures of these halos when the gas finally collapses .",
    "only a single clump is formed at the center of each collapsing cosmological halo , regardless of the strength of the photodissociating background , up to a baryon number density of @xmath3  @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that , as in the more commonly - studied mode of star formation , we will find only a single star per halo even in objects which are massive enough that t@xmath12  k."
