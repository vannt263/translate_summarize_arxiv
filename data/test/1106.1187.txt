    "in this article i summarize recent progress in the field of chirally enhanced self - energies in the mssm done in collaboration with jennifer girrbach , lars hofer , ulrich nierste , janusz rosiek and dominik scherer .",
    "the discussion will skip the technical aspects and subtleties and instead focus on the essential features .",
    "the interested reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion .    in the standard model chirality violation",
    "is suppressed by small yukawa couplings ( except for the top quark ) .",
    "however , the mssm does not necessarily possess the same suppression effects since the bottom yukawa coupling can be big at large of @xmath1 and also the trilinear @xmath2-terms do not necessarily respect the hierarchy of the yukawa couplings . thus , chirality - flipping self - energies can be enhanced either by a factor of @xmath3 @xcite or by a ratio @xmath4 .",
    "this enhancement can compensate for the loop suppression leading to corrections which are of the same order as the corresponding physical quantities , i.e. of order one .",
    "these large corrections must be taken into account to all orders in perturbation theory ( sec .",
    "[ renormalization ] ) leading to effective fermion - gaugino and fermion - higgs couplings ( see sec .  [ vertices ] ) .",
    "it is even possible that light - fermion masses and the ckm elements are entirely due to radiative corrections involving the trilinear @xmath2-terms  @xcite .",
    "such a model of radiative flavor - violation can solve the susy - cp @xcite and the susy - flavor problem while still leading to interesting effects in flavor - observables ( see sec .",
    "[ radiative ] ) .",
    "one can decompose any fermion self - energy into chirality - flipping and chirality - conserving parts in the following way : @xmath5 here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are flavor indices running from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . since the susy particles are known to be much heavier than the sm fermions it is possible to expand in the external momentum . for our purpose",
    "it is even sufficient to work in the limit @xmath10 in which only the chirality - flipping parts @xmath11 remain .",
    "it is well known that in the mssm these self - energies can be enhanced either by a factor @xmath3 @xcite or by a factor @xmath12 @xcite which compensates for the loop - suppression and leads to order one corrections .",
    "the chirality - changing part of the fermion self - energy ( at @xmath10 , involving sfermions and gauginos(higgsions ) ) can be written as @xmath13 here @xmath14 stands for the susy fermions ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 denotes their corresponding number ( 2 for charginos , 4 for neutralinos and 8 for gluinos ) .",
    "the coupling coefficients @xmath17 and the loop functions @xmath18 are defined in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the couplings @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ mssm - self - energies ] ) involve the corresponding sfermion mixing matrices @xmath20 which diagonalize the sfermion mass matrices : @xmath21 . in the case of neutralino - quark - squark and chargino - quark - squark vertices",
    "they also depend on yukawa couplings and ckm elements .    an interesting feature of the self - energies in eq .",
    "( [ mssm - self - energies ] ) is that they are finite and that they do not vanish in the limit of infinitely heavy susy masses .",
    "we refer to this approximation in which only such non - decoupling terms for the self - energies are kept as `` the decoupling limit '' .",
    "note , however , that we do not integrate out the susy particles but rather keep them as dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "let us take a closer look at the quark self - energy with squarks and gluinos as virtual particles . to leading order in @xmath22 , the self - energy is proportional to one chirality flipping element @xmath23 of the squark mass matrix : @xmath24 here the off - diagonal elements of the sfermion mass matrices are given by @xmath25 and the matrices @xmath26 take into account the flavor changes due to bilinear terms .",
    "note that in the decoupling limit @xmath27 depends only on the bilinear terms .    for equal susy masses we can give a simple approximate formula for the self - energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gluinose ] ) : @xmath28 thus , generic @xmath29-terms which are of the order @xmath30 lead to self - energies which are approximatly @xmath31 . the part of eq .",
    "( [ se_approx ] ) containing @xmath32 is of the order of 2 gev for @xmath33 . in the case of up - quarks ,",
    "only the part of the self - energy proportional to @xmath34 can be important : it is of the order of 1.5 gev for @xmath35 .    according to eq .",
    "( [ deltalr ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ se_approx ] ) the quark self - energy with a gluino as virtual particle can be divided into a part linear in a yukawa coupling and a part linear in an @xmath2-term .",
    "such a decomposition is possible for all self - energies ( in the decoupling limit ) because either a yukawa coupling or a trilinear @xmath2-term is needed in order flip the chirality .",
    "thus , we can also decompose the chargino self - energies ( we do not consider the neutralino self - energy here , because it is usually subleading ) in an analogous way . in the flavor changing case we also have to distinguish whether the flavor - change is due to a ckm element or not which is important when we consider later the ckm renormalization .",
    "thus we decompose the down - quark self - energy as follows : @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the part of the flavor - conserving down - quark self - energy proportional to @xmath38 divided by @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the sum of all self - energies where the flavor - change is not due to ckm elements and @xmath41 arises from the part of the chargino self - energy where the flavor change comes from a ckm element : @xmath42 for the discussion of the effective higgs vertices we also need a decomposition of @xmath43 into its holomorphic and non - holomorphic parts . here",
    "non - holomorphic means that the loop - induced coupling is to the other higgs doublet than the on involved in the yukawa - term of the superpotential , i.e. for down - quarks the self - energy involves @xmath44 and for up - quarks the self - energy contains @xmath45 . in the decoupling limit",
    "all enhanced holomorphic self - energies are proportional to @xmath2-terms and we denote the the sum as @xmath46 , while the non - holomorphic part is denoted as @xmath47 : @xmath48",
    "chirally - enhanced self - energies modify the relation between the bare yukawa couplings @xmath49 and the corresponding physical fermion masses @xmath50 . for quarks",
    "we have the relation : @xmath51 eq .",
    "( [ mq - yq ] ) implicitly determines the bare yukawa couplings @xmath52 for a given set of susy parameters . in the up - quark sector",
    "the enhanced terms in the self - energy @xmath53 are independent of @xmath54 .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ mq - yq ] ) is easily solved for @xmath54 and one finds @xmath55 in the down - quark sector we have terms proportional to one power of @xmath38 at most ( in the decoupling limit ) and by solving eq .",
    "( [ mq - yq ] ) we recover the well - known resummation formula @xcite with an extra correction due to the @xmath2-terms @xcite for @xmath56 , except for the vev . ] : @xmath57    the flavor - changing self - energies @xmath58 induce wave - function rotations @xmath59 in flavor - space which have to be applied to all external fermion fields . at the two - loop level @xmath60",
    "is given by @xmath61 where we have neglected terms which are quadratic or of higher order in small quark mass ratios and we have defined the abbreviation @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding expressions for @xmath63 is obtained from the one for @xmath64 by replacing @xmath65 . the rotations in eq .",
    "( [ deltau ] ) also renormalize the ckm matrix .",
    "the bare ckm matrix @xmath66 , which arises because of the misalignment between the bare yukawa couplings , is now determined through the physical one by @xmath67 this equation can be solved analytically by exploiting the ckm hierarchy .",
    "first one calculates the effects of @xmath40 which lead to an additive change in the ckm elements .",
    "then the self - energies containing ckm elements lead to a scaling of new ckm elements @xmath68 elements by a factor @xmath69 ( similar to eq .",
    "( [ md - yd ] ) ) .",
    "the effective higgs vertices are most easily obtained in an effective field theory approach @xcite which is an excellent approximation to the full theory .",
    "in addition to the flavor - diagonal holomorphic couplings of quarks to the higgs fields flavor - changing couplings to both higgs doublets are induced via loops .",
    "the resulting effective yukawa - lagrangian is that of a general 2hdm of type iii and is given ( in the super - ckm basis ) by : @xmath70d_{i\\,r}\\\\ -\\bar{q}^a_{f\\,l } \\left [ ( y^{u_i } \\delta_{fi } +    e^u_{fi})\\epsilon_{ab}h^b_u \\,+\\ , e^{\\prime u}_{fi } h^{a\\star}_d    \\right]d_{i\\,r}\\ , .",

    "the loop - induced couplings @xmath76 are given by @xmath77 diagonalizing the effective quark mass matrices ( after electroweak symmetry breaking ) and decomposing the higgs fields into their physical components leads to the following effective neutral higgs couplings : @xmath78 { \\gamma_{d_f d_i } ^{h_k^0\\,lr\\,\\rm{eff } } } = x_d^k \\left ( \\frac{m_{d_i } } { v_d } \\delta_{fi } - \\widetilde e_{fi}^{\\prime d}\\tan\\beta \\right ) + x_u^{k\\star}\\widetilde e_{fi}^{\\prime d } \\,,\\\\[0.2 cm ] \\end{array }   \\label{higgs - vertices - decoupling}\\ ] ] with @xmath79 the new term @xmath80 is especially interesting : it contains a non - holomorphic flavor - conserving part which multiplies a flavor - changing holomorphic term . in this way",
    "the holomorphic @xmath2-terms can lead to flavor - changing neutral higgs couplings .",
    "the origin of this term can be understood in the following way : even though the couplings @xmath81 are holomorphic , they lead to an additional rotation ( if @xmath81 is flavor non - diagonal ) which is needed to diagonalize the effective quark mass matrix .",
    "these rotations then lead to off - diagonal neutral higgs couplings even if @xmath82 is flavor conserving .",
    "this effect will allow us to explain the @xmath83 mixing in our model with radiative flavor - violation .",
    "effective gaugino(higgsino)-fermion - vertices which include the chirally - enhanced corrections are obtained by inserting the bare values for the yukawa couplings and the ckm elements into the corresponding feynman - rules and applying the wave - function rotations in eq .",

    "the smallness of the off - diagonal ckm elements and the yukawa couplings of the first two generations suggests the idea that these quantities might be due to radiative corrections , i.e. they are zero at tree - level .",
    "indeed , as we have see previously , the self - energies involving the trilinear @xmath2-terms lead to order one effects in the renormalization of the ckm elements and the light fermion masses and it is possible that they are generated by the self - energy radiative corrections @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ se_approx ] ) we see that this is the case if the @xmath2-terms are of the same order as the other susy parameters .    however , the third generation fermion masses are too heavy to be loop generated ( without unnaturally large values for the @xmath2-terms which would violate vacuum stability@xcite ) and the successful bottom  tau ( top  bottom ) yukawa coupling unification in su(5 ) ( so(10 ) ) guts suggests to keep the third generation fermion masses .",
    "thus we assume the following structure for the yukawa couplings of the mssm superpotential : @xmath94 this means that ( in the language of @xcite ) the global @xmath95 ^ 5 $ ] flavor symmetry of the gauge sector is broken down to @xmath96 ^ 5 \\times [ u(1)]^2 $ ] by the yukawa couplings of the third generation . here",
    "the five @xmath97 factors correspond to rotations of the left - handed doublets and the right - handed singlets of the first two generation fermions in flavor space , respectively .",
    "let us first consider the quark sector .",
    "here we demand that the light quark masses and the off - diagonal ckm elements are generated by gluino self - energies . regarding only the first two generations , no direction in flavor space",
    "is singled out by the yukawa term in the superpotential and the cabbibo angle is generated by a misalignment between @xmath34 and @xmath29 . regarding the third generation , the situation is different because their non - zero yukawa couplings fix the quark - field rotations involving the third generation .",
    "thus @xmath98 are generated by a misalignment between the @xmath34 , @xmath29 and the third generation yukawa couplings .",
    "we will consider the two limiting cases in which the ckm elements arise only from a mismatch between ( @xmath29 ) @xmath34 and ( @xmath99 ) @xmath99 which we call ckm generation in the down ( up ) sector for obvious reasons .",
    "this means we require @xmath100    if the ckm matrix is generated in the down - sector the most stringent constraint stems from an enhancement of @xmath84 due to the off - diagonal element @xmath101 in the squark mass matrix .",
    "the resulting bounds on the squark and gluino mass are shown in the left plot of fig .",

    "also @xmath83 mixing can be affected but because it is protected by a peccei - quinn symmetry a double higgs penguins contributes only if also @xmath103 is non - zero ( see right plot in fig .  [ muon_bs ] ) .",
    "in the case of ckm matrix generation in the up - sector , the most stringent constraints stem from @xmath104 ( see right plot of fig .",
