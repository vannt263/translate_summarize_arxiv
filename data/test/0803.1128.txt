    "the transport of energy or heat has been intensively studied since fourier introduced his famous law of heat conduction in 1807 . surprisingly , still 200 years later",
    ", some fundamental problems remain unsolved@xcite .",
    "contrary to our everyday experience , the appearance of diffusive behavior according to fourier s famous law is difficult to obtain from the direction of any underlying microscopic theory .",
    "a question of central relevance concerns the classification of the transport properties of a system into _ normal diffusive _ or _",
    "ballistic _ behavior . in the classical domain , it seems to be largely accepted that normal energy transport , i.e. , spatial diffusion instead of ballistic transport or localization , requires the chaotic dynamics of a nonintegrable system @xcite . in the quantum regime , however , the question whether diffusive behavior follows from the underlying theory turns out to be a controversial issue @xcite .",
    "this is mostly due to the nontrivial character of the question , how energy is transported on the microscopic scale .    amongst the many different techniques of investigating transport in quantum mechanics ,",
    "let us consider two approaches in more detail here .",
    "the first one is the prominent green - kubo formula .",
    "derived on the basis of linear response theory it has originally been formulated for electrical transport@xcite .",
    "therein , the system is perturbed by an external force , first the electric field , applied to the system .",
    "the resulting current of charge is viewed as the response to this external perturbation .",
    "finally , the transport coefficient ( conductivity ) follows from a current - current autocorrelation .",
    "the same approach is also used in the different case of density driven transport , e.g. , the transport of energy or heat . in such a situation ,",
    "the current is driven by a much more complicated mechanism ( the coupling of reservoirs to the system ) than simply an external force , which can be nicely written as a term within the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "nevertheless , the correlation function is ad hoc transferred to the density driven scenario by replacing the electrical current by the energy or heat current@xcite .",
    "however , the justification of this replacement remains a conceptual problem here .",
    "one big advantage of this widely used approach is certainly its computability after having diagonalized the system s hamiltonian .",
    "a nice overview of results from the kubo formula for spin models can be found , e.g. , in the work by heidrich - meisner@xcite ( for further reading we suggest the comprehensive literature cited therein ) .",
    "however , in most cases , a direct analytical solution for an infinite system is not feasible and the interpretation of the results for finite systems seems to be not straight forward . for a finite system ,",
    "the frequency dependent transport coefficient consists of numerous delta peaks with different weights at frequencies @xmath0 and is zero elsewhere . how to extract the dc - conductivity ( interesting especially for the energy transport ) of the finite system from this result or extrapolate the conductivity for the infinite one is a difficult question@xcite .",
    "a different approach to investigate the transport behavior of a system is more connected to the experimental measurement of heat conductivities : the system is directly coupled to heat baths of different temperatures within the theory of open quantum systems@xcite .",
    "that means that the liouville von neumann equation , describing the time evolution of the density operator of the system , is extended by incoherent damping terms simulating the influence of the heat baths .",
    "how to set up the correct dynamical equation here is highly nontrivial and involves the combination of many subtle approximation schemes . in the case of an improper approach , the derivation can lead to mathematically correct , but physically irrelevant dynamical equations as discussed recently@xcite .",
    "having derived a proper quantum master equation ( qme ) , the interpretation of the results for finite systems is relatively easy : after finding the stationary state of the dissipative dynamics , all interesting quantities as currents and energy profiles are simply accessible by computing the expectation value of the respective operator",
    ". however , also this approach is restricted to finite systems since a complete analytical solution for larger systems is not available .",
    "thus , the extrapolation to infinite systems needs a careful discussion to exclude errors due to the finite size of the investigated models as well .    in the present paper",
    ", we will consider several model systems according to their transport properties .",
    "this is mainly done by the bath coupling method as discussed above , and by comparing with results from the kubo formula .",
    "let us start in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] with an introduction to the qme , the necessary observables and the monte carlo wave - function technique@xcite which is used to integrate the qme .",
    "afterwards , we will present the results for several model systems : for chainlike systems in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] and more complex ones in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , followed by our summary and conclusion .",
    "the considered system consists of @xmath1 weakly coupled subunits described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 the first part @xmath3 of the hamiltonian contains the local spectra of the subunits .",
    "the second part @xmath4 describes the interaction between adjacent sites with the coupling strength @xmath5 . here",
    ", we require that the interaction is weak in the sense that the energy contained in the local part is much larger than the energy contained in the interaction part , @xmath6 .",
    "more concretely , we will investigate one - dimensional ( 1d ) or quasi-1d chains of two - level atoms or spin-1/2 particles .",
    "both , two - level atoms and spins , are described by the same algebra , and thus , it is convenient to use the pauli operators @xmath7 as a suitable operator basis here .",
    "the above mentioned weak coupling claim is fullfilled by introducing a local zeeman splitting @xmath8 , where we require that @xmath9 is much larger than the coupling constant @xmath5 .",
    "note that this _ weak internal coupling _ constraint is a necessary precondition for the validity of the master equation introduced below , i.e. , we are not able to consider systems with @xmath9 approaching the same magnitude as @xmath5 here . hence , the models described by the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) are not to be confused with spin chains in cuprates , e.g. , where the local field is always close to zero , and thus , small compared to the coupling strength .",
    "however , the discussed models can be seen as spin chains in strong external fields , or simply as weakly coupled chains of two - level atoms as frequently considered in quantum optics and quantum information theory .    to investigate the transport properties of these systems ,",
    "they will be explicitly coupled to independent environments of different temperatures .",
    "let us discuss the appropriate ( qme)@xcite to describe this situation in the following section .",
    "in general , the derivation of the qme from a microscopic model@xcite ( a system coupled to an infinitely large environment ) relies on some well known approximation schemes the markov@xcite assumption , the born approximation and the secular approximation@xcite .",
    "recently , there was a discussion on how to derive a suitable lindblad@xcite qme in a nonequilibrium scenario@xcite , i.e. , an equation to investigate transport in weakly coupled quantum systems .",
    "the lindblad form of a qme defines a trace and hermiticity preserving , completely positive dynamical map@xcite , which thus retains all properties of the density operator at all times . in order to approach this dynamical equation the approximations",
    "are carefully carried out in a minimally invasive manner , to retain the central nonequilibrium properties of the model .",
    "it was shown that this _ nonequilibrium _ lindblad qme is in very good accord with the results of the redfield master@xcite equation ( non - lindbladian ) , contrary to the standard lindblad qme in the weak coupling limit@xcite .    in a nonequilibrium investigation ,",
    "one needs two heat baths at different temperatures _ locally _ coupled to the system , i.e. , the heat baths couple only to a subunit at the edge of the system .",
    "the qme of such a situation yields @xmath10 _ { } } + { \\mathcal{d}}_{l}({\\hat{\\rho } } ) + { \\mathcal{d}}_{r}({\\hat{\\rho}})\\,,\\ ] ] where the dissipator @xmath11 refers to the left heat bath and @xmath12 to the right one , depending on the full density operator @xmath13 of the system , i.e. , the state of the chain described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "both dissipators depend on the coupling strength @xmath14 between system and bath as well as the temperature of the bath , respectively . besides those incoherent damping terms , eq .",

    "the coefficient matrices depend on the respective bath temperature @xmath21 and are defined as @xmath22 according to the rates @xmath23 with the bath coupling strength @xmath14 .",
    "this concrete form of the @xmath24-matrices follows from a phenomenological ansatz for the spectral density of the environment , here chosen to be of ohmic@xcite kind .    a remarkable property of eq .  ( [ eq:3 ] )",
    "is that it can be brought into lindblad form by diagonalizing the coefficient matrices @xmath24 .",

    "although extended stochastic schemes exist for the solution of general qmes such as , e.g. , the redfield equation @xcite , these methods have turned out to be less efficient , in general , than the standard approach .",
    "the most interesting state of a nonequilibrium scenario is the local equilibrium state , i.e. , the stationary state of the qme ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "this state can be characterized by two central observables  the energy gradient and the energy current .",

    "since we are investigating internally weakly coupled subunits in the limit @xmath32 the local energy density is approximated by the local hamiltonian here .",

    "if both current and gradient are equal at all sites @xmath29 , and furthermore , the gradient is finite , a bulk conductivity@xcite follows from @xmath41 this is called _ normal _ or _ diffusive _ transport . on the other hand ,",
    "if the gradient vanishes @xmath42 diverges and the transport is called _",
    "ballistic_. however , that does not mean that the current diverges as well . due to the resistivity at the contact to the heat bath ( in our approach @xmath14 ) , the current will always remain finite .",
    "even if we directly get a result in terms of normal or ballistic behavior for all _ finite _ systems here , a nonzero gradient in the finite system is not sufficient to deduce normal transport in the _ infinite _ one , too .",
    "the influence of the contact could dominate the investigation or long ballistic waves could be suppressed in the finite system .",
    "thus , in order to obtain statements on the properties of the infinite system ( bulk properties ) , it is important to investigate scaling properties as well . for normal transport behavior , both gradient and current must tend to zero for infinitely large systems .",
    "then and only then the system shows diffusive behavior . a finite current within an infinite system",
    "will always indicate ballistic transport behavior .",
    "note that the current operator discussed in eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) is essentially the standard spin current operator , multiplied by the ( large ) zeeman splitting @xmath9 . due to the zeeman splitting",
    ", there is an energy flow associated with any nonvanishing spin current .",

    "( [ eq:15 ] ) , i.e. , it does not contain any energy current that would be present even if @xmath9 was zero . eventually , the stationary state of the qme ( [ eq:2 ] ) will feature such a nonvanishing spin current . even though the @xmath43-component of the magnetization is conserved on the chain",
    ", the reservoirs may create and annihilate magnetization in @xmath43-direction .",
    "hence , we do not compensate for this current by applying an adequate magnetic gradient in the sense of onsager@xcite ( magnetic seebeck effect@xcite ) . doing so , for large @xmath9 , the energy flow described by eq .",

    "a very powerful technique to find the stationary state without diagonalizing the liouvillian is based on the stochastic unraveling@xcite of the qme .",
    "the basic idea is to depart from a statistical treatment by means of density operators and turn to a description in terms of stochastic wave functions .",
    "in fact , any qme of lindblad form can equivalently be formulated in terms of a stochastic schrdinger equation ( sse ) for the wave function @xmath47 @xmath48 which describes a piecewise deterministic process in hilbert space . the first term on the right hand side of eq .",

    "( [ eq : sse ] ) contains the poisson increments @xmath51 which obey the following statistical properties @xmath52    the stochastic process , defined by the sse ( [ eq : sse ] ) , can be conveniently simulated by the following prescription .",
    "starting from a normalized state , the first step of the unraveling procedure is to integrate the time - dependent schrdinger equation according to the effective hamiltonian defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:18 ] ) .",
    "since it is not hermitian the normalization of the state @xmath47 decreases until @xmath53 , with @xmath54 being a random number drawn from a uniform distribution on the interval @xmath55 at the beginning of the step .",

    "this procedure leads to one realization @xmath59 of the stochastic process . averaging over @xmath60 realizations the time evolution of eq .",

    "the expectation value of an observable @xmath61 at time @xmath31 can be estimated through @xmath62 in a finite ensemble of @xmath63 realizations to arbitrary precision .",
    "this is of huge practical importance , as one deals with wave functions with @xmath64 elements instead of density operators with @xmath65 elements .",
    "furthermore , if one is interested in the stationary state , ensemble averages can be replaced by time averages@xcite and one single realization suffices to determine the stationary expectation value @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "it turns out that introducing this uniform time discretization , and allowing for jumps to occur at multiples of @xmath68 only has several technical advantages .",
    "however , one has to bear in mind , that this introduces an error of order @xmath69@xcite .",
    "a further problem is that for @xmath70 , the total number of timesteps @xmath71 have to be increased in order to retain a sufficient number of jumps in the average ( [ eq:23 ] ) .",
    "this overall increase of accuracy will be purchased at the cost of tedious computations .",
    "nevertheless , in practice , the time - averaging procedure proves highly efficient , and results of sufficient accuracy could always be produced .",
    "it is further advisable to discard the initial time evolution in the average in order to obtain reliable results , i.e. , by choosing @xmath72 .    in order to gain the standard deviation as a measure for the statistical error",

    "<S> we investigate energy transport in several two - level atom or spin-1/2 models by a direct coupling to heat baths of different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is carried out on the basis of a recently derived quantum master equation which describes the nonequilibrium properties of internally weakly coupled systems appropriately . </S>",
    "<S> for the computation of the stationary state of the dynamical equations , we employ a monte carlo wave - function approach . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis directly indicates normal diffusive or ballistic transport in finite models and hints toward an extrapolation of the transport behavior of infinite models . </S>"
