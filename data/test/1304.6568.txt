    "the physics of amorphous solids raises some problems that do not exist in perfect crystals .",
    "while it is well known that disorder brings about ( anderson ) localization of eigenfunctions @xcite , it is commonly assumed that such localization is limited to eigenfunctions associated with high energies .",
    "low - frequency eigenfunctions are believed to be spatially extended .",
    "this picture fails in amorphous solids that are subjected to an external strain .",
    "here one finds that the lowest energy eigenfunction can become localized .",
    "this localization can take the form of a plastic event that changes the local organization of particles through the creation of essential non - affine displacement .",
    "sometimes the plastic instability can exhibit itself as a system spanning event of shear localization along a line in 2-dimensional systems @xcite and a plane in 3-dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "these events are crucially important in limiting the toughness of technologically important materials like metallic glasses .",
    "these instabilities are the subject of this paper .    to be as precise as possible , we will deal in this paper with 2-dimensional systems ( although the 3-dimensional extension is available @xcite ) which are athermal ( at temperature @xmath2 ) and strained quasi - statically @xcite .",
    "we will consider systems which are good glass formers , containing @xmath3 particles in a volume @xmath4 , interacting via generic interaction potentials that are sufficiently smooth ( with at least two continuous derivatives ) .",
    "the total energy can be written then in terms of the positions @xmath5 of these particles , @xmath6 .",
    "the hessian matrix is defined as the second derivative @xcite @xmath7 the hessian is real and symmetric , and therefore can be diagonalized . excluding goldstone modes whose eigenvalues are zero due to continuous symmetries , all the other eigenvalues are real and positive as long as the system is mechanically stable . in equilibrium , without any mechanical loading , the eigenfunctions associated with the large eigenvalues are localized due to anderson localization , as it was mentioned above .",
    "however , all the eigenfunctions associated with the low eigenvalues ( including all the excess modes that are typical to amorphous solids ) are spatially extended .",
    "it had been a major discovery of the last decade that at small values of the external strain there appear `` fundamental plastic events '' in which the eigenvalues of hessian matrix hit zero via a saddle node bifurcation , and simultaneously the associated eigenfunctions get localized @xcite .",
    "this is a new mechanism for localization , different from the well known anderson mechanism , and it is the basis for the understanding of plastic instabilities in amorphous solids . it had been shown that at low values of the external stains the spatial ranges of these plastic events are system - size independent @xcite , involving a small number of particles , of the order of 100 .",
    "the displacement fields associated with fundamental plastic events are reliably modeled by eshelby inclusions ( see below for details ) .",
    "it had been a more recent discovery that at higher values of the external strains these fundamental plastic events can organize in highly correlated lines in 2-dimensional system or in planes in 3 dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "these highly correlated _ densities _ of eshelby inclusions are the microscopic manifestation of the shear localization .",
    "the key idea of the recent work on the shear localization is that at @xmath2 with quasi - static loading the preferred spatial organization of the density of eshelby inclusions could be found by minimizing their total energy in the strained system . in refs .",
    "@xcite the theory was worked out for simple external shear in both 2 and 3 dimensions .",
    "it was found that in the case of a pure external shear the shear - localization is realized by organizing the inclusions on a line ( plane ) in 2 ( 3 ) dimensions that are precisely at @xmath8 with respect to the principal stress axis .",
    "an additional important result is an analytic prediction for the yield - strain ( where shear localization occurs for the first time ) in terms of the properties of the eshelby solution for the fundamental plastic event ( a single inclusion ) .",
    "it is well known however that for other loading conditions , e.g. uniaxial tension or compression , the value of the yield strain as well as the direction of the shear band can vary considerably @xcite , indicating that the pure shear is a special case .",
    "it was reported recently in @xcite that the difference can be related to the more general form of the eshelby inclusion which models the fundamental plastic instability at different loading conditions .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to offer the theory in sufficient detail and to work out analytic predictions of the yield strain .",
    "the calculations involved are straightforward but sometimes cumbersome , and we make an effort to offer them in an optimally didactic way in the sequel .    in sect .",
    "[ simulations ] we present results for aqs numerical simulations in uniaxial compression and extension to provide us with data on yield strains and directions of shear bands .",

    "we first start from a well equilibrated liquid at a high temperature of @xmath23 which is supercooled to @xmath24 at relatively fast quenching rate of @xmath25 .",
    "then , we equilibrated these supercooled liquids for times greater than @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the time taken for the self intermediate scattering function to approach @xmath28 of its initial value .",
    "lastly , following this equilibration , we quenched these supercooled liquids deep into the glassy regime at a temperature of @xmath29 at a reduced quench rate of @xmath30 . following this quench we took the glass to mechanical equilibrium ( nearest energy minima ) by a conjugate gradient energy minimization .",

    "two different loading protocols were applied , one is uniaxial compression and the other - uniaxial extension .",

    "assuming all eigen strains and the eigen directions to be the same , we have from equations ( [ e_infty ] ) and ( [ e_esh ] ) , @xmath185 and @xmath186 since the inclusions are localized in a strip of dimensions @xmath187 , the energy density of these two terms is computed as @xmath188 it is easy to check that these two terms are the only ones that are _ linear _ in the density @xmath189 ( other terms are either of order @xmath190 or @xmath191 ) .",
    "now for @xmath192 this energy density _ increases _ with @xmath189 .",
    "the only solution that minimizes the energy is the single inclusion with @xmath193 .",
    "the condition that identifies @xmath31 requires the derivative of this energy density with respect to @xmath189 to vanish .",
    "in other words , the coefficient of @xmath189 in eq .",

    ", we find the best fit for the analytic expression of the elastic field produced by the eshelby quadrupolar structure ( eq .",
    "( [ uc - final ] ) ) to our numerical findings .",
    "such a fitting procedure yields the values of ( @xmath196 , @xmath176 ) as ( 0.9 , -0.14 ) and ( 0.9 , 0.09 ) for compression and extension respectively . in fig ( [ best - fit ] ) , we show our fits for both cases .    using eq .",
    "( [ finalstrain ] ) and the estimates of @xmath176 and @xmath195 , we estimate the yield strain for the case of compression and extension as @xmath197    this should be compared with the observed values of 5.5% and 3.5% respectively in fig .",
    "( [ stress - strain ] ) .",
    "we consider the agreement quite satisfactory .",
    "experimental observations and numerical simulations show that plastic phenomena in amorphous solids demonstrate essential asymmetry between the cases of uniaxial compression and extension .",
    "these asymmetries are manifested in different angles the shear bands form with respect to the principal direction of stress and in very different values of the yield strain .",
    "the results presented in this paper demonstrate that both asymmetries can be quantitatively described on the basis of atomistic theory of plastic events .",
    "we also derive analytically that the values of the shear band angles lie between @xmath198 in good agreement with available experimental data .",
    "we reiterate the essential steps : one calculated the energy associated with @xmath9 eshelby inclusions , and in view of our athermal conditions minimizes this energy to find the selected distribution of inclusions .",
    "we find that for @xmath199 the only solution that minimizes the energy is that containing a single eshelby inclusion . at @xmath200",
    "a new branch of solutions can open up , allowing for a density of inclusions to establish itself .",
    "the minimum energy is realized by a line of equi - distant inclusions that aligns with and angle @xmath157 to the principal stress axis .",
    "the angle depends on the loading conditions as encoded by the eigenvalues of the eshelby quadrupole . only for simple shear",
    "we expect this angle to be 45@xmath35 , while in general it is limited between 30@xmath35 and @xmath1 .",
    "finally we computed analytically the yield - strain asymmetry under uniaxial loading conditions .",
    "a natural extension of our present work is a 3d generalization .",
    "other possible directions would be to include finite temperature and strain rate effects .",
