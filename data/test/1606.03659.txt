    "@xmath6  =  0.031 ) is a nearby and bright blazar classified as a typical `` high - frequency - peaked '' bl lac ( hbl ) object whose synchrotron and ic emission components extend up to x - ray and very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath4-ray photon energies , respectively .",
    "it is in fact the first extragalactic source detected in the tev range @xcite . as such",
    ", mrk  421 is one of the most comprehensively studied hbls through a number of observation campaigns . in particular , recent multi - wavelength campaigns , including , have provided the first ever complete coverage of the @xmath4-ray continuum of the source in its low - activity / quiescence state @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the fractional variability amplitude @xmath7 , when plotted as a function of frequency , also reveals a double - peak structure echoing the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of mrk  421 : @xmath7 rises significantly from the radio towards the x - ray frequencies , decreases over the band , and finally rises again in the tev regime @xcite .",
    "this finding seems to imply that , in the framework of the `` homogeneous one - zone '' emission model , the high - energy tail of the electron energy distribution ( synchrotron x - rays and tev @xmath4-rays emitted via the ic process ) is highly variable , while the low - energy segment of the electron energy distribution is relatively steady .",
    "the alternative interpretation is a stratified ( multi - zone ) blazar emission model with highly variable high - energy emissions produced in distinct ( more compact ) emission sites compared with lower - energy emissions , which vary more slowly .        in this context ,",
    "broadband x - ray observations of mrk  421 may in principle provide unique clues on the variability and spectral properties of both the low- and the highest - energy segments of the electron energy distribution because the synchrotron continuum of the blazar falls exponentially around photon energies of several / tens of kev ( at least during the low - activity states ) .",
    "this reflects the high - energy cutoff in the underlying electron energy distribution , so the radiative output of the source in the hard x - ray range may be dominated by the low - energy tail of the ic emission component .",
    "however , in the case of bl lacs in general and hbls in particular , including the x - ray brightest source mrk  421 , x - ray data above 10kev are deficient and available typically only for isolated flaring periods ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is because previous hard x - ray observations relied on `` non - imaging '' detectors for which the sensitivity was insufficient to detect the source in its low - activity states .",
    "the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array mission (; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the first focusing high - energy x - ray telescope in orbit and operates in the band from 3 to 79kev .",
    "thanks to its imaging capability , probes the hard x - ray sky with a more than 100-fold improvement in sensitivity .",
    "@xcite and @xcite presented the observations of mrk  421 during flaring epochs . in this paper , we revisit the archival mrk  421 data provided by in january 2013 and discussed previously by @xcite when the source was in a historical low - activity state corresponding to an extrapolated @xmath8kev energy flux of @xmath9erg@xmath10s@xmath11 .",
    "mrk  421 was selected as a representative of the hbl class of blazars and thus has been observed frequently with since january 2013 , partly in the framework of extensive multi - frequency campaigns .",
    "the total exposure time over 88 orbits amounts to more than 250ks , including two calibrating observations conducted in july 2012 @xcite .",
    "a typical observation spans 10 hrs ; hence , the actual exposure for each observation , after only `` good time intervals '' are selected to eliminate the passage of the south atlantic anomaly and orbital modulation of visibility , ranges from 10ks to 25ks .",
    "all observations were conducted with two co - aligned independent telescopes called focal plane module a and b ( fpma and fpmb ) . throughout the observations , variations in the count rate of more than two orders of magnitude were observed .",
    "it has been argued that the synchrotron emissions of the blazar account for all the flux detected up to 79kev during the flaring states @xcite .",
    "here , we focus on the historical low - flux state of mrk  421 , which was witnessed by in january 2013 ( see table[table1 ] for the logs of the analyzed observations ) .",
    "the archival data were downloaded from nasa s heasarc interface and reduced by using the ` nustardas ` software , which is included as part of the ` heasoft ` package version 6.17 . for the temporal and spectral studies presented in the following sections ,",
    "the x - ray events were extracted from a circular region with a radius of @xmath12 and centred on the source position , whereas the background was accumulated in an annulus with inner and outer radii of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "we carefully checked that other choices of source and background regions did not affect the analysis results presented in the next sections within uncertainties of @xmath14 .",
    "the response files were generated by using the standard ` nupipeline ` and ` nuproducts ` scripts .",
    "version 20151008 of the caldb files were used in this study . even in the historical low - flux state of the target ,",
    "the extracted x - ray count rates were well above the background level up to 40kev and almost equal to the background level above 40kev . with good characterization of the background , which left the uncertainty at a @xmath15 level @xcite ,",
    "the gathered mrk  421 data could therefore be used for spectral modeling up to the high - energy end of the band at 79kev .",
    "figure[fig : lightcurve ] shows the count rate variations during the observations between january  2 ( mjd  56294 ) and january  20 ( mjd  56312 ) .",
    "the x - ray counts from both fpma and fpmb detectors are summed , and the background is subtracted .",
    "the light curves are shown separately for the two different energy bands : @xmath0kev ( top panels ) with 2ks binning and @xmath3kev ( bottom panels ) with 20ks binning .",
    "the light curves indicate that the @xmath0kev source flux was nearly constant except for mjd  56307 when a pronounced variability was observed and the average flux increased by a factor of three .",
    "in addition , note that the source was detected at more than the @xmath16 level in the 40@xmath1779 kev band not only in mjd  56307 but also in mjd  56302 , when an average @xmath0kev count rate was lowest . for the remaining two observations , we provide the corresponding @xmath18 confidence level upper limits .",
    "figure[fig : images ] compares the temporal variations in the x - ray images of mrk  421 in the @xmath3kev energy range .",
    "these were reconstructed by using the sum of the fpma and fpmb data in mjd  56294 , 56302 , 56307 and 56312 , respectively .",
    "the images were smoothed by a gaussian kernel of @xmath19 and color - coded ; the given color bar indicates a relative excess of photon counts in arbitrary units for which the maximum value is corrected for different exposure times of each observation ( see table[table1 ] ) . note that the target was clearly detected at more than the @xmath2 level only in mjd  56302 and 56307 , which is consistent with the source light curve given in figure[fig : lightcurve ] . a slightly higher significance for the images ( @xmath20 ) compared to the light curves ( @xmath21 ) is because source counts were extracted from a circular region with a radius of @xmath12 for figure[fig : lightcurve ] , whereas all of the detected photons were used for figure[fig : images ] against the point spread function of .",

    "the residuals in the figure corresponding to the pl fit ( best - fit photon index @xmath39 with @xmath35/dof of 262.3/249 ) indicate that the source spectrum exhibits significant hard excess emissions above 20kev .",

    "the detection of mrk  421 above 40  kev in such a low flux state manifested in a concave broadband x - ray spectrum of the target with excess hard x - ray emissions dominant at photon energies above 20kev ( table[table1 ] and figure[fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "however , this excess was not found in the mjd  56294 or 56312 data when the source was in a similarly low - flux state ( figures[fig : lightcurve ] and [ fig : images ] ) , which implies a variability of the hard x - ray continuum on the timescale of a week .    to investigate the physical origin of the detected excess emission",

    "the dashed magenta lines mark the extrapolation of the best - fit power - law model applied to the average data ( @xmath4-ray photon index of @xmath43 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with @xmath14 uncertainty .",
    "the excess hard x - ray emissions detected in the analyzed data agreed well with the extrapolation of the average spectrum .",
    "this indicates that the quiescence continuum of mrk  421 , which extends from photon energies of tens of kev up to tens of gev , corresponds to a single ic emission component and is well - described by a power - law model with a photon index of @xmath44 .",
    "interestingly , similar spectral upturns related to the synchrotron / ic crossover have been detected below 10kev in several other blazars classified as `` low - frequency - peaked '' bl lacs ( lbls ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but never in hbls either below or above 10kev .",
    "further novelty here is that the high - energy excess feature found in the data for mrk  421 is variable on the time scale of a week ; no evidence for such variability in the low - energy segment of the ic emission continuum has been reported for other bl lacs in the literature .     and the galactic column density of @xmath37@xmath10 , fitted over the @xmath38kev band .",
    "the bottom panels show the data / model ratio residuals for the power - law fit ( pl ) , broken power - law fit ( bkn - pl ) , and double power - law fit ( pl+pl ) .",
    "deviations above 20 kev are clearly seen in the pl fitting , as detailed in the text . ]",
    "an alternative explanation for the observed hard x - ray excess of the target is a spectral pile - up in the electron distribution @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the electron lorentz factor , forming temporarily at the highest energies .",
    "this feature may appear due to either ( i ) a continuous ( stochastic ) acceleration of electrons limited by radiative losses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or ( ii ) the reduction of the ic cross section in the klein - nishina regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of ( i",
    ") , the pile - up bump appears at the maximum electron energies for which the acceleration timescale equals the radiative loss timescale at the limit for the perfect confinement of electrons within the emission zone ( i.e. , no particle escape ) .",
    "however , the power - law tail at lower electron energies has to be relatively flat in such a scenario , @xmath47 , which disagrees with the observation in mrk  421 .",
    "similarly , in the case of ( ii ) , the necessary condition for the formation of a pronounced spectral hardening in the electron energy distribution is the dominance of ic cooling over the synchrotron one and a relatively narrow ( within the frequency range ) seed photon distribution .",
    "these requirements contradict the conditions expected for the mrk  421 jet in its quiescence ( for which the synchrotron losses dominate the ic ones and the soft photon distribution for the ic scattering is provided by the broadband synchrotron emission of the jet itself ) .",
    "therefore , while also considering the extrapolation of the spectrum of the source to the x - ray regime , we argue that the hard x - ray excess found in the data indeed represents the low - energy tail of the ic ( ssc ) component .    from the observed ssc photon energy of @xmath48kev and a steep broadband power - law",
    "electron energy distribution , the corresponding minimum electron lorentz factor is roughly @xmath49 the radiative cooling timescale for such low - energy electrons dominated by the synchrotron process is then @xmath50 which is much longer than a week for the comoving magnetic field intensity @xmath51 g emerging from the one - zone ssc model applied to the quiescence sed of mrk  421 @xcite .",
    "hence , the variability of the low - energy electrons implied by the observations analyzed in this paper have to be related to dynamical changes within the blazar emission zone for which the shortest timescale is given by the light crossing time @xmath52 .",
    "interestingly , this would agree with the emission region size assumed in the sed model of @xcite",
    ". in particular , one has @xmath53 which implies the distance of the emission zone from the active nucleus @xmath54pc for the anticipated conical jet geometry with the opening angle @xmath55 and the jet bulk lorentz factor @xmath56 .",
    "this is also in accord with the detailed analysis of the overall variability of mrk  421 at x - ray frequencies , which implies that the power in the intraday flickering of the source is small @xcite .",
    "-ray (; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spectra of mrk  421 .",
    "bow - ties plotted in black denote the data taken in different multi - frequency campaigns ; the average source spectrum during the period of a source quiescence ( from 2008 august 5 to 2010 february 20 ) is shown as a magenta bow - tie .",
    "dashed magenta lines mark the extrapolation of the best - fit power - law model to the average data ( @xmath4-ray photon index of @xmath57 ) . ]    in addition , the results of our data analysis revealed that the electron energy distribution in mrk  421 during the source quiescence is well - represented by a relatively steep power law with the energy index of @xmath58 , which extends from electron energies of at least @xmath59 up to @xmath60 ( in the jet rest frame ) .",
    "this is an important finding because in such a case the bulk of the jet kinetic energy is carried by those low - energy electrons ( assuming no significant proton content ) .",
    "the exact value of the electron spectral index is also important based on the most recent results for the kinetic simulations of relativistic magnetic reconnection process . in other words , the power - law energy spectra formed within the reconnection sites are steep ( @xmath61 only if the jet magnetization is low @xcite .",
    "again , low magnetization of the emission region would be in accord with the model parameters emerging from a simple one - zone ssc models @xcite .",
    "however , note that this conclusion is with regard to only the slowly variable / quiescence emission component because the production of rapid high - amplitude flares in blazar sources may proceed under very different conditions , and may involve very different electron spectra .",
