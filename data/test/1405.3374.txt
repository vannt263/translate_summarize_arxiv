    "in recent years many significant developments have taken place in minimal model program ( mmp ) ( see , for example , @xcite ) based on the major advances in the study of singularities of pairs .",
    "similarly a categorical approach to mmp was taken by kawamata .",
    "this approach was based on the correspondence mori fibrations ( mf ) and semiorthogonal decompositions ( sod ) .",
    "there was no use of the discrepancies and of the effective cone in this approach .",
    "in the meantime a new epoch , epoch of wall - crossing has emerged . the current situation with wall - crossing phenomenon , after papers of seiberg  witten ( @xcite ) , gaiotto  moore ",
    "neitzke ( @xcite ) , cecotti  vafa ( @xcite ) and seminal works by donaldson ",
    "thomas ( @xcite ) , joyce  song ( @xcite ) , maulik  nekrasov  okounkov  pandharipande ( @xcite , @xcite ) , douglas ( @xcite ) , bridgeland ( @xcite ) , and kontsevich  soibelman ( @xcite , @xcite ) , is very similar to the situation with higgs bundles after the works of higgs and hitchin  it is clear that general `` hodge type '' of theory exists and needs to be developed .",
    "this lead to strong mathematical applications  uniformization , langlands program to mention a few . in",
    "the wall - crossing it is also clear that `` hodge type '' of theory needs to be developed in order to reap some mathematical benefits  solve long standing problems in algebraic geometry .",
    "several steps were made to connect homological mirror symmetry ( hms ) to birational geometry ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main idea in this paper is that proving hms is like studying birational transformations ( noncommutative included ) on a and b side of hms .",
    "later new ideas were introduced in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these ideas can be summarized as follows :    1 .   the moduli spaces of stability conditions of fukaya ",
    "seidel categories can be included in a one - parametric family with the moduli space of landau  ginzburg ( lg ) models as a central fiber .",
    "2 .   the moduli space of lg models determines the birational geometry  in the toric case this was proven in @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this paper is that we consider all mori fibered spaces together , all sarkisov links together , all relations between sarkisov links together .",
    "the relations between all sarkisov links are determined by geometry of the moduli space of lg models and the moving schemes involved .      1 .",
    "all fano varieties via their degenerations are connected by simple basic links  projections of a special kind .",
    "we show it ( see table  [ table ] ) on picard rank 1 fano threefolds .",
    "these relations agree with their toric landau  ginzburg models ( see theorem  [ theorem : toric table ] ) .",
    "2 .   all fano manifolds can be considered together . in other words",
    "there exists a big moduli space of lg models , which includes mirrors of all fanos .",
    "we demonstrate this partially in the case of two- and three - dimensional fanos .",
    "we introduce an analogue of the canonical divisor measure for minimal model . for us",
    "this is the local geometry of the singularities and a fiber at infinity of the lg model .",
    "the last one affects the geometry of moduli spaces of lg models  stability conditions .",
    "in fact we propose local models for these moduli spaces ( stacks ) . with this observation the correspondence between usual and categorical approach to birational geometry looks as in table  [ tab : cpintro ] .",
    "+ .extended kawamata program . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]              in case the question above has a positive answer we get a way of comparing the moving schemes of the divisors at infinity .",
    "we will also get a way of deciding if the corresponding moduli spaces of landau  ginzburg models can be deformed to each other which according to  @xcite is a way of deciding if we can build a sarkisov link between them .",
    "it is clear that the numbers @xmath0 fit well in the landscape of quadric bundles .",
    "we expect particularly interesting behavior from the numbers @xmath0 coming from the phantom categories the existence of which was conjectured earlier .",
    "it is also clear that the geometry of the moving scheme in general has a deep connection with the geometry of the fano manifold .",
    "in fact following @xcite we associate a complex of singularities with this moving scheme .",
    "so it is natural expect that we can read many geometrical properties of fano manifolds from this complex of singularities .",
    "for example , it has been conjectured by s .-",
    "t.yau , g.tian , and s.donaldson that some kind of _ stability _ of fano manifolds is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of khler ",
    "einstein metrics on them .",
    "this conjecture has been verified in two - dimensional case ( see @xcite ) and in the toric case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , one direction of this conjecture is now almost proved by donaldson , who showed that the existence of the khler ",
    "einstein metric implies the so - called @xmath1-semistability ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recall that g.tian ( see  @xcite ) defined the notion of @xmath1-stability , arising from certain degenerations of the manifold or , as he called them , test configurations .",
    "proving yau ",
    "donaldson conjecture is currently a major research programme in differential geometry ( see @xcite ) .",
