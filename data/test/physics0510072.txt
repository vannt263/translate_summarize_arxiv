    "the possibility of fundamental constants to vary is predicted by theories unifying gravity with other interactions ( see , e.g. review by uzan  @xcite ) .",
    "there is an evidence found in quasar absorption spectra that the fine structure constant @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) might be smaller in early cosmological epoch  @xcite .",
    "however , similar analysis applied by other authors to different sets of data does not support this claim @xcite .",
    "recent progress in improving atomic clocks and developing optical frequency standards ( see , e.g. @xcite ) made it possible to put strong constrains on possible time variation of fundamental constants in laboratory measurements .",
    "in particular , constrains obtained for the fine structure constant @xmath5 need only about one order of magnitude improvement to see whether they are consistent with the quasar absorption spectra data if the same rate of change is assumed over cosmological time .",
    "these constrains were obtained with the full use of the technique developed for highly accurate optical standards .",
    "however , the choice of atomic transitions was not optimal for searching of variation of the fine structure constant .",
    "frequencies used so far change at about the same rate as @xmath5 if @xmath5 changes , i.e. there is no enhancement",
    ".    an alternative approach was suggested in refs.@xcite .",
    "it was proposed to measure small frequency between two close states with different dependence on @xmath5 .",
    "here small change of @xmath5 may lead to orders of magnitude larger relative change in frequency .",
    "the enhancement factor @xmath7 can be expressed as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the difference in relativistic energy shifts of two levels and @xmath10 is transition frequency . a good candidate for such experiments",
    "is dysprosium atom  @xcite .",
    "it has two almost degenerate states of opposite parity and corresponding enhancement factor is of order of @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the measurements for dysprosium are currently underway at berkeley  @xcite .    while it is hard to find anything better than dysprosium in terms of enhancement factor , it has its disadvantages too .",
    "the levels involved are not so narrow .",
    "while one of the states lives long enough to cause no problem the other level does not .",
    "one has to work inside the line width to have the desirable accuracy .",
    "this puts certain limitations on achievable constrains on @xmath5-variation .",
    "therefore , it would be important to find something which combines the advantages of having metastable states and strong enhancement .",
    "a number of such transitions were considered in recent work  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested to look at close metastable states of different configurations .",
    "energies of different configurations change at different rates when @xmath5 is changing .",
    "this , together with small energy intervals between the states ensures strong enhancement  @xcite .",
    "in present work we consider slightly different possibility .",
    "we suggest to study anomalously small fine structure intervals in ground configurations of many - electron atoms .",
    "the use of the ground state fine structure multiplet ensures that states are metastable .",
    "they can only decay via @xmath12-transitions which are very much suppressed due to small value of transition frequency . on the other hand , configuration interaction in many - electron atoms can reduce fine structure intervals and lead to strong sensitivity to the change in the fine structure constant . in next sections we consider in detail fine structure of the ground state of tellurium and",
    "discuss some other possibilities .",
    "to study sensitivity of atomic frequencies to variation of the fine structure constant @xmath5 it is convenient to present them in the vicinity of the physical value of @xmath5 ( @xmath13 ) in the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 and coefficient @xmath16 defines the sensitivity of the frequency to variation of @xmath5 . in general , its value can be found from atomic calculations . if @xmath5 changes the relative frequency changes at the rate @xmath17 where @xmath18 is enhancement factor . to search for variation of the fine structure constant",
    "one needs to compare atomic frequencies with different enhancement factors over long period of time .",
    "the larger this difference the more sensitive the experiment to variation of @xmath5 .",
    "note that @xmath7 can have negative value which means that changes of @xmath5 and frequency go in opposite directions : frequency decreases when @xmath5 increases and vise versa .    for `` normal '' fine structure intervals which are proportional to @xmath19 formula ( [ omegaq ] ) is valid for all values of @xmath5 , @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in other words ,",
    "the factor @xmath7 is the same for all `` normal '' fine structure intervals and comparison between them can not reveal any drift of @xmath5 .",
    "these fine structure intervals can still be used in search for variation of the fundamental constants if they are compared to hyperfine structure or to frequencies of suitable optical transitions .",
    "situation changes dramatically if fine structure multiplet is strongly perturbed by configuration interaction with neighboring states .",
    "we consider neutral tellurium atom in its ground state as an example .",
    "experimental and theoretical energies of the ground state @xmath23 configuration of tellurium are presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "there are strong anomalies in the fine structure multiplet @xmath2p@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath2p@xmath24 - @xmath2p@xmath3 and @xmath2p@xmath3 - @xmath2p@xmath4 intervals have opposite signs and differ in value more than hundred times .",
    "this is because of configuration interaction between the @xmath2p@xmath24 and @xmath25d@xmath24 states and between the @xmath2p@xmath4 and @xmath25s@xmath4 states while the @xmath2p@xmath3 state has no close neighbors to mix with .",
    "configuration interaction leads to accidental almost exact cancellation between spin - orbit and coulomb terms in the energy interval between the @xmath2p@xmath3 and @xmath2p@xmath4 states .",
    "since spin - orbit interaction is much more sensitive to the change of @xmath5 than the coulomb term , it is natural to expect that the @xmath2p@xmath3 - @xmath2p@xmath4 energy interval is very sensitive to the variation of @xmath5 .",
    "to check how strong is sensitivity of the fine structure intervals of te  i we perform model configuration interaction ( ci ) calculations for the @xmath23 configuration of the atom .",
    "first , we perform hartree - fock calculations for open shells to find the @xmath26 and @xmath27 states of neutral tellurium",
    ". then we use the ci technique to construct four - electron states of the @xmath23 configuration and to calculate their energies ( in fact , in this approximation ci technique is reduced to diagonalization of the interaction hamiltonian describing direct mixing of different @xmath23 states ) .",
    "it turns out that some extra fitting is needed to have good agreement with experiment .",
    "namely , we reduce the value of the @xmath28 coulomb integral by 25% . this reduction simulates the effect of screening of coulomb interaction between valence electrons by core electrons .",
    "the results for energies are presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "one can see that in spite of simple approximation used in calculations the agreement with experiment is very good .",
    "coefficients @xmath16 ( see eq.([omegaq ] ) ) are found by varying @xmath5 in computer codes : @xmath29 the results for @xmath16 are also presented in table  [ tab1 ] . since we have good agreement with experiment for the energies it is natural to assume that the accuracy for the @xmath16-coefficients is also good .",
    ".[tab1]experimental and theoretical energies and @xmath16-coefficients ( @xmath30 ) for the @xmath23 ground - state configuration of te  i. [ cols=\"^,^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     calculations for ce  ii are more difficult than for te  i and po  i because of valence states of high angular momentum ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) . therefore we believe that it is premature to attempt them now .",
    "the presence of enhancement is obvious but its actual value would become important only on the stage of planning the measurements .",
    "we are ready to perform the calculations if there is any interest from experimentalists .",
    "cases of fine structure anomalies similar to what is presented here for ce  ii can be easily fond in spectra of many other rare - earth elements . which of them are suitable for the search of @xmath5 variation is the question which needs further consideration .",
    "we present an alternative way to search for variation of the fine structure constant in laboratory measurements . we propose to use fine structure intervals in the ground or low excited states of many - electron atoms which are strongly perturbed by configuration interaction with neighboring states .",
    "this method has double advantages . on one hand",
    ", the use of low states ensures that they are metastable .",
    "this is important for very accurate frequency measurements . on the other hand",
    ", strong perturbation may lead to anomalously small fine structure interval and strong enhancement of the relative sensitivity of the frequencies to the change of the fine structure constant . because of the high relative sensitivity one does need extremely accurate absolute measurements of the frequencies ( this is the difference with conventional atomic clock measurements ) .",
    "large value of the effect / frequency ratio may also help to reduce importance of some systematic effects ( e.g. the doppler shift and broadening ) .",
    "note , however , that we do not consider in this paper any practical measurement scheme .",
    "enhanced and highly non - linear dependence of the small fine structure intervals on the magnitude of the relativistic corrections also presents certain theoretical interest .",
