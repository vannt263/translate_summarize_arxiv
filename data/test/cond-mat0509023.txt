    ", we adopted a similar procedure to measure the average number of parallel edges , @xmath75 .",
    "configurations chosen at a temperature @xmath76 were quickly cooled down ( the system was held for 20 mcs at each @xmath77 ) to the temperature @xmath78 at which calculations where performed .",

    "if the cooling is 10 times faster , then this effect does not occur , i.e. the disordered surfaces remains frozen .",

    "[ figure5 ] ) .",
    "we think that this effect is connected with large sizes of step - like \\{211 } facets on a curved surface . a massive transport of atoms is needed to reduce one convex edge by merging two neighbouring \\{211 } steps",

    "we see in fig.[figure6](a ) that the surface energy of a flat surface rapidly decreases at the defaceting temperature @xmath74 .",

    "thus , the faceting of a curved surface is thermodynamically favorable .",
    "results of monte carlo simulations show that the morphology of a faceted surface depends on the annealing temperature .",
    "one can distinguish three stages : ( 1 ) formation of 3-sided pyramids around the [ 111 ] pole and step - like \\{211 } facets between the faces of \\{211 } orientations .",

    "we believe that this fact can be used to determine the temperature of defaceting , provided that @xmath74 is below the desorption temperature ( desorption is not included in the model ) .",
    "formation of facets after a rapid cooling of disordered surface can be explained by a fast massive atomic rearrangement .",
    "such effect has been observed in a pd / mo(111 ) system @xcite in which 3-sided pyramidal facets occur on the bcc(111 ) surface after annealing to higher temperatures .",
