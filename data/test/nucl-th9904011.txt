    "systematic investigations of a(@xmath10 ) reactions at saclay , nikhef , mainz and bates have produced an impressive amount of data for various target nuclei @xcite . for the sake of minimizing the uncertainties with respect to the reaction mechanism ,",
    "a large fraction of these investigations were done under or close to quasi - elastic kinematics ( bjorken @xmath11  1 ) .",
    "these data sets highlight at the same time the success and the limits of the independent - particle - model ( ipm ) for atomic nuclei @xcite . indeed , after corrections for final - state interactions and coulomb distortions of the electron probe , the shape of the deduced proton momentum distributions are systematically in line with the predictions of modern formulations of the nuclear ipm . on the other hand , below the fermi momentum the absolute magnitude of the deduced momentum distributions are systematically , i.e. independent of the nucleon momentum , lower than ipm predictions .",
    "to cut a long story short , the major conclusion from this world - wide @xmath5 effort seems that an appropriate non - relativistic picture of the nucleus is roughly compatible with _",
    "70% mean - field behaviour and 30% `` correlations '' _ an observation which is still frequently ignored in various nuclear structure calculations and model developments .",
    "the energy of the available electron beams with a large duty factor ( @xmath12  1  gev ) made that most of this aforementioned @xmath5 work was done at four - momentum transfers of the order @xmath13  0.2  ( gev / c)@xmath3 . with the advent of the tjnaf and an upgraded mainz electron facility higher values of @xmath2",
    "come into reach of experimental exploration .    amongst the major physics goals motivating exclusive ( @xmath10 ) measurements from finite nuclei at higher momentum transfer ( @xmath14 ( gev / c)@xmath3 ) one can mention the following ones .",
    "the higher @xmath2 conditions and unmistakingly smaller distance scales probed should make it feasible to achieve a better understanding of the short - range mechanisms in nuclei . at the same time",
    ", one could hope to find experimental evidence for the onset of quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "presumably , the most convincing evidence pointing into that direction could come from measurements for processes that are fairly well understood at lower @xmath2 ( like ( @xmath10 ) at x=1 ) and turn out to be completely at odds with meson / baryon models when higher @xmath2 regimes are entered .",
    "another challenge for ( @xmath10 ) measurements at higher momentum transfers is the question whether available relativistic models can succeed in producing a better agreement with the data sets than the non - relativistic ones and if so , which dynamical degrees of freedom make them to be substantially different from what is commonly implemented in the non - relativistic nuclear many - body models .",
    "another fundamental question that has received a great share of attention for many years , is the question whether the nucleon properties ( like electromagnetic form factors e.g. ) are modified in the nuclear medium .",
    "this information is of unvaluable importance for models that embark on the ambitious program of understanding nuclei in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "a challenging but at the same time rather ambiguity - free way of probing the medium - dependent form factors , are double polarization observables from a(@xmath0 ) measurements @xcite .",
    "indeed , double polarization observables are conceived to be rather insensitive to ambiguities with respect to the final state interactions ( fsi ) that affect most of the other a(@xmath10 ) observables .",
    "other effects that are recognized to possibly complicate the interpretation of double polarization observables in terms of medium - dependent nucleon form factors are gauge ambiguities , channel - couplings and two - body current effects . whereas the first two sources of possible dilutions were extensively studied by kelly @xcite and found to produce very small corrections , the two - body current effects are not well studied for finite nuclei .",
    "earlier efforts to study the role of two - nucleon currents in exclusive a(@xmath10 ) reactions from finite nuclei ( a@xmath154 ) include the pioneering work of suzuki @xcite , the systematic investigations by the pavia group @xcite and the @xmath16he(@xmath10 ) studies as e.g. reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to make their calculations computationally more attractive ,",
    "the results of the pavia group were obtained with a two - body current operator that was formally reduced to an effective one - body one .",
    "this approximation adopts a fermi - gas picture for the residual nucleus that allows to integrate out the coordinates of the second nucleon that gets involved in the photoabsorption process . for the work presented here , we treat the two - body currents in their full ( non - relativistic ) complexity and deal with the multi - dimensional integrals that automatically occur when",
    "several nucleons get involved in the ( virtual ) photoabsorption process .",
    "a similar sort of exact treatment was earlier adopted in our work reported in references @xcite .",
    "there it was found that the effect of the two - body currents on the a(@xmath10 ) cross sections , just as the role of the coupled - channel effects , is gradually decreasing with increasing momentum transfer .",
    "this conforms to the findings with respect to the momentum - transfer dependence of the two - body current effects in the d(@xmath10)n and @xmath16he(@xmath10 ) @xcite . nevertheless , even at the highest momentum transfer considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ( q=600  mev / c ) the cross sections were predicted to be substantially affected by the two - body currents . in this work",
    "the role of meson - exchange and isobar degrees of freedom in a(@xmath0 ) and a(@xmath1 ) is investigated in a wide range of four - momentum transfers ( 0.2 @xmath170.8  ( gev / c)@xmath3 ) .",
    "special emphasis is placed on the recoil polarization observables as they open perspectives to investigate possible medium modifications of the nucleon properties .",

    "the escaping nucleon polarization observables can be determined through measuring * ratios*. the _ induced polarization _ can be addressed with unpolarized electrons ( i =",

    "@xmath36 is a shorthand notation for the differential cross section for an electrodisintegration process initiated by an electron with helicity @xmath35 and for which the ejectile is detected with a spin polarization characterized by @xmath37 . throughout this work we adopt relativistic kinematics .",
    "for the model calculations presented here , the bound and scattering states are produced by solving a schrdinger equation with a mean - field potential that is obtained from a hartree - fock calculation .",
    "the latter are performed with an effective nucleon - nucleon force of the skyrme type .",
    "the mean - field potential includes central , spin - orbit and coulomb terms .",
    "this model does not require any empirical input with respect to the inital and final - state potentials .",
    "moreover , the orthogonality condition between the initial and final states is obeyed and gauge invariance is preserved at the one - body current level .",
    "a drawback of the model is that the inelastic processes , which are commonly accounted for through imaginary parts in the final - state potential , are only partially included .",
    "the major impact of the rescattering processes in exclusive ( @xmath10 ) is generally conceived , however , to be a mere reduction of the absolute cross section . in the kinematics regime of interest here",
    ", the reduction factor can be estimated from nuclear transparency @xmath5 measurements as they were recently performed at tjnaf for various target nuclei @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section , the various structure functions and polarization observables are all calculated starting from the following set of transition matrix elements @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 refer to the quantum states of the target and residual a-1 nucleus and @xmath41 denotes the spin projection of the ejectile along the z - axis .",
    "the latter is chosen to coincide with the direction of the momentum transfer @xmath42 . when calculating the induced and transverse polarizations as defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : indu ] ) and  ( [ eq : trans ] ) the transition matrix element for the ejectile s spin pointing in a certain direction determined by the polar and azimuthal angle ( @xmath43 ) are required .",
    "these can be easily obtained from the above matrix elements ( [ eq : matr ] ) by remarking that @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the wigner @xmath46-matrix for @xmath47 @xmath48    in determining the matrix elements of eq .",
    "( [ eq : matr ] ) , a standard multipole expansion for the electromagnetic current operators and the `` distorted '' outgoing nucleon wave is made .",
    "the multipole expansion of the current operators tends to converge more slowly as more extended systems and higher momentum transfers are addressed .",
    "for the highest momentum transfer considered here ( @xmath49  gev ) , convergence in the @xmath50o calculations could only be reached after including all multipolarities up to @xmath51=30 .",
    "this number is compatible with the estimate one would obtain by setting @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the nuclear radius determined by @xmath54 . the large number of multipoles required for calculations at high momentum transfer is a serious numerical complication that prevents models that were developed for lower energy and momentum transfers from being easily extended to higher energy and momentum domains .",
    "apart from the fact that a full treatment of the relativistic effects would be in order , the partial - wave expansion technique hampers extending the presented formalism beyond the range of momentum - transfers considered here ( @xmath551  gev / c ) .",
    "a quasi - elastic ( @xmath10 ) process will predominantly excite those a-1 states @xmath56 that bear a sizeable hole state component in their overlap with the ground - state of the target nucleus .",
    "this component of the final wave function can be constructed starting from the standard multipole expansion in terms of particle - hole @xmath57 excitations out of the ground state of the target nucleus @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the reduced mass of the outgoing nucleon , @xmath61 is the central phase shift and @xmath62 is the coulomb phase shift related to the electromagnetic part of the mean - field potential . the above expression has been derived for the following conventions with respect to the asymptotic behaviour of the continuum eigenstates @xmath63 of the mean - field potential   and the total a - body wave function : @xmath64 where @xmath53 is the nuclear radius .",

    "even when making an abstraction from issues related to off - shell corrections , the derivation of an appropriate current operator with relativistic corrections to be used in calculations that adopt a non - relativistic description for the strong interaction part of the reaction process , is not free from ambiguities @xcite .",
    "for example , the two standard techniques to derive a non - relativistic reduction of relativistic hamiltonians , i.e. the foldy - wouthuysen ( fw ) and the `` direct pauli reduction '' method , have been shown to make a difference as far as the final expressions for the current operators are concerned @xcite .",
    "admittedly , the problems encountered in implementing relativistic corrections in non - relativistic calculations can be avoided by adopting a fully relativistic description for the nuclear dynamics . over the years , a number of fully relativistic models for ( @xmath10 )",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "basically , all of these models start from a relativistic formulation of the mean - field idea and do not embody current operators that go beyond the ia .",
    "unfortunately , for finite nuclei a realistic , empirically well - founded and practicable relativistic nuclear - structure model that _ also accounts for the multi - nucleon degrees of freedom _ is as yet not available . with this in mind we shall resort to a non - relativistic approach for the strong interaction dynamics of the @xmath5 process .",
    "we deem this model to be a reliable and valuable testing ground to estimate the relative importance of subnuclear degrees of freedom .",
    "the conventional way of deriving a nonrelativistic reduction of the above one - body current operator is the fw technique which relies on a ( @xmath67 ) expansion .",

    ", the impact of the two - body currents would generally not be noticed when comparing results of calculations performed within the ia with data but would simply be `` effectively '' accounted for in the spectroscopic factor that is used to scale the dwia calculations to the data .",
    "the net effect of the two - body currents is a reduction of the cross sections .",
    "this reduction is of the order 10 - 20% for the lowest missing momenta range and can amount to a factor of two at @xmath158  mev / c .",
    "note that for the highest missing momenta considered in figures [ fig : blom1 ] and [ fig : blom2 ] inclusion of the two - body currents tends to increase the cross section .",
    "this is generally the case when higher missing momenta are probed @xcite",
    ". the observed reduction at low missing momenta that was ascribed to two - body current effects is not sufficient to explain why the data are substantially lower ( factor of two ) than expected on the basis of dwia models .",
    "indeed , the curves of figures [ fig : blom1 ] and [ fig : blom2 ] are obtained with a reduction factor of 0.25 for the ground - state transition and 0.30 for the @xmath50o(@xmath10)@xmath140n(3/2@xmath159,6.32  mev ) transition . with these values",
    "we obtain reasonable visual fits of the data .",
    "the transparency at the considered four - momentum transfers @xmath2 is experimentally determined to be about 0.75 for a light nucleus like @xmath120c @xcite . when correcting the reduction factors we have applied to obtain visual fits of the data , for transparency ( or attenuation ) corrections that fall beyond the scope of our model calculations , we obtain the spectroscopic factors @xmath160e@xmath161=0.0  mev)@xmath162 0.67 and @xmath163e@xmath161=6.3  mev)@xmath1621.6 .",
    "in line with the theoretical conclusions drawn from the analyses of references  @xcite and @xcite these values are substantially smaller than the values obtained with high - resolution measurements at lower proton kinetic energies where it was found that @xmath164e@xmath161=0.0  mev)=1.20 and @xmath163e@xmath161=6.3  mev)=2.00 @xcite .",
    "note , however , that for @xmath165 knockout the spectroscopic factor that is deduced from the calculations that include the two - body currents is about 30% larger than the value that would be deduced in the ia .",
    "another striking feature of the results displayed in figures [ fig : blom1 ] and [ fig : blom2 ] is that the influence of the subnuclear degrees - of - freedom is more pronounced for knockout from the `` stretched '' ( @xmath166 ) orbit ( i.e. @xmath165 ) than from its `` jack - knifed '' spin - orbit partner ( @xmath167 ) ( i.e. @xmath168 ) .",
    "the major reason for this behaviour is simply that all the two - body current operators have a strong spin dependency .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the relativistic effects arising from the lower ( or negative energy ) components in the bound state wave functions were recently shown to have a similar sort of sensitivity .",
    "indeed , the ( relativistic ) @xmath5 results for knockout from the `` stretched '' orbits will be closer to their respective non - relativistic limits than those for `` jack - knifed '' orbits @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the predicted relativistic effects attributed to the small components in the bound state wave functions are smallest for these transitions with maximal two - body current contributions .",
    "the question arises whether the relatively strong sensitivity to two - body currents noticed in figures  [ fig : blom1 ] and [ fig : blom2 ] is an intrinsic property of the specific @xmath2 range probed or is rather due to the fact that these results were acquired at smaller values of x and subsequently clearly out of quasi - elastic conditions .",
    "results for real quasi - elastic kinematics at about the same value for the proton s kinetic energy and initial electron energy are shown in figures  [ fig : mommainz ] .",
    "these results are obtained in quasi - perpendicular kinematics . here ,",
    "the variation in missing momentum is reached by varying the polar angle @xmath169 of the ejected proton . for the remainder of this paper",
    "all calculated ( reduced ) cross sections are shown for full sub - shell occupancy , i.e. @xmath170 .",
    "it becomes clear that under strict quasi - elastic conditions the effect of the subnuclear degrees - of - freedom is substantially smaller than at smaller values of bjorken x. it is worth mentioning that the results of figure  [ fig : mommainz ] are obtained in more transverse kinematics than those of figures  [ fig : blom1 ] and [ fig : blom2 ] .",
    "accordingly , with the eye on minimizing the effect of two - body currents it is very essential to move in quasi - elastic conditions _ even if this implies shifting to kinematics which is conceived to be transverse .",
    "_ another observation is that the extent to which to the two - body currents are important does not depend on the polar angle @xmath171 of the ejected nucleon .",
    "figures [ fig : strmainz ] and  [ fig : polmainz ] show the structure functions and polarization observables for the same kinematics in which the cross sections of figure  [ fig : mommainz ] are obtained . in presenting the structure functions we prefer not to divide out any kinematical variables from the different contributions to the total angular cross section .",
    "formally , this means that we write eq .",
    "( [ eq : eep ] ) in the form @xmath172 where the precise definition of all contributing terms is obvious .",
    "this way of presenting results has the outspoken advantage that the relative contribution of each term in the cross section can be easily evaluated .",
    "furthermore , possible confusions regarding the adopted definitions for the different structure functions are avoided . in line with the observations made for @xmath173he and the deuteron @xcite case , the interference terms that are an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath174 and @xmath175 exhibit the strongest sensitivity to contributions that go beyond the ia .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the recoil polarization observables . for coplanar kinematics the sole non - vanishing recoil polarization observables are @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "the @xmath178 does vanish identically in the plane - wave impulse approximation .",
    "as such it allows to constrain the model assumptions with respect to the final - state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "inspecting figure  [ fig : polmainz ] it is clear that at low missing momenta the qualitative behaviour of the induced polarization @xmath178 turns out to be relatively insensitive to the current contributions beyond the impulse approximation .",
    "this result confirms the findings of the pavia calculations reported in ref .",
    "the first data set for the induced polarization in finite nuclei has recently become available @xcite . in figure",

    "is more pronounced than for @xmath180-shell knockout . given that we do not rely on any empirical input for the description of the fsi , the agreement with the data is satisfactory but inferior to the quality of agreement that was reached with the calculations by j.j .",
    "kelly @xcite .",
    "these calculations constrain the description of the final - state interactions with the aid of optical potentials derived from the analysis of hadronic induced reactions .",
    "for most observables , the meson - exchange and isobar effects are acting in opposite directions . at low missing momenta",
    "the induced polarization exhibits a small sensitivity to the two - body currents . at moderate and high missing momenta the @xmath178",
    "is predicted to exhibit a large sensitivity to two - body currents .",
    "a similar observation is made for the polarization transfer observables .",
    "recently it was shown that the recoil proton polarizations for p(@xmath0 ) and d(@xmath0)n are almost identical @xcite . from the theory side ,",
    "rather small contributions from the mec and ic in the double polarization observables were predicted in the deuteron @xcite and @xmath173he @xcite case in quasi - elastic kinematics . despite the fact that the polarization transfer variable @xmath181 and @xmath177 are related to the interference structure functions @xmath182 and @xmath183 their predicted sensitivity to the two - body currents looks relatively small .",
    "recently , the polarization transfer observables raised considerable interest in that they would provide a direct handle on the ( possible ) medium dependence of the nucleon form factors .",
    "indeed , in the plane - wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) it can be shown that for electroexcitation from a free proton @xmath184 it is of the utmost importance to investigate all possible mechanisms that could bring about changes in the above ratio without being related to medium modifications of the form factors . whereas it was recently shown that final - state interaction and gauge ambiguities",
    "effects are only marginally affecting the ratio @xmath185 @xcite the question arises whether meson - exchange and isobaric currents could bring about any change in the ratio of the double polarization observables . whereas the impact of the subnuclear d.o.f . on the value of polarization observables",
    "looks small in quasi - elastic kinematics and small missing momenta , the mec and ic are not necessarily unimportant , especially for such delicate issues like nucleon form factor studies where the medium dependency is predicted to be modest @xcite and the projected accuracy of the planned experiments is astounding . with the aim of studying the sensitivity of the ratio @xmath185 to meson - exchange currents and intermediate isobar creation",
    "we have calculated the following double ratio @xmath186 where `` @xmath187 '' refers to the calculated ratio in the impulse approximation , this is when retaining solely the one - body currents in the calculations but keeping all other ingredients fixed .",
    "as could be expected , the observed deviation from the ia result enhances as the missing momentum increases . the most favorable regime to perform the recoil polarization measurements for knockout from p - shell orbits , is probably in the peak of the cross section ( @xmath188100  mev / c ) . for the @xmath50o(@xmath10)@xmath140n(1/2@xmath159 ) transition , the deviation in the ratio @xmath185 that is attributed to the mec and ic is about 5 - 10% in the peak of the cross section . for knockout from its spin - orbit partner ( @xmath165 )",
    "the calculated effect is 10 - 15% . in both cases , at 200  mev / c the modifications in the ratio due to two - body currents has grown to 20% and with increasing @xmath69 the effect appears to be rather out of control .",
    "we continue our investigations into the role of two - body currents by considering the kinematics of the tjnaf experiments e89 - 003 and e8 - 9033 @xcite .",
    "the e89 - 003 experiment has measured the separated structure functions and momentum distributions for @xmath50o(@xmath10 ) under quasi - elastic conditions at @xmath189=2.445  gev , @xmath118=445  mev and q=1  gev / c . in e89 - 033 on the other hand , the @xmath50o(@xmath190 ) polarization observables were measured for approximately the same kinematics .",
    "figures [ fig : mome89003]-[fig : sstate ] summarize the calculated results for the reduced cross sections , structure functions and recoil polarization observables for knockout from the two @xmath180-shell and the @xmath191-shell state . in comparing these results with those obtained in the previous subsection for quasi - elastic conditions at lower four - momentum transfer , we can study the @xmath2 dependency of the meson and isobar degrees of freedom . in analogy with the obvervations made at lower @xmath2 , the pion - exchange currents ( `` mec '' )",
    "increase the cross section and this effect is completely counterbalanced by the @xmath9 current that produces the largest contributions .",
    "the @xmath2 dependency of the two - body current effects can maybe be better estimated from the individual structure functions .",
    "comparing figures  [ fig : strmainz ] and [ fig : str3e89003 ] one does indeed observe a decreasing trend in the relative importance of the two - body currents .",
    "a similar tendency is observed for the recoil polarization observables ( figure  [ fig : pol2a3 ] .",
    "the deviation in the ratio @xmath192 in the peak of the cross section is of the order of a few percent for the ground - state transition ( knockout from the @xmath168 orbit ) , whereas for the excitation of the @xmath193 hole state at 6.32  mev excitation energy in @xmath140n ( knockout from the stretched @xmath165 orbit ) the effect is close to 10% .    with the aim of studying the medium - dependent effects one",
    "could be tempted to probe the region of highest nuclear density which for a nucleus like @xmath50o implies studying the region of @xmath194 knockout . in light of the mass - independence of the two - body current effects that is frequently alluded to ,",

    ". from all orbits studied here , knockout from the @xmath194 orbit exhibits the strongest sensitivity to the two - body currents .",
    "after all , this observation is not that surprising given its stretched status and the fact that the region of highest nuclear density is probed .",
    "for example , the @xmath195 and @xmath196 interference responses in figure  [ fig : str1e89003 ] grow substantially after including the two - body currents .",
    "indications for the strong sensitivity of the @xmath197 structure function to two - body currents was reported for the @xmath173he case in ref .",
    "@xcite . also for the recoil polarization observables in the missing - energy range of @xmath194 knockout ( figure  [ fig : sstate ] ) , sizeable contributions from the meson - exchange and isobar currents are predicted . for the ratio @xmath185 the two - body currents bring about a reduction which is slightly bigger than 10% .",
    "this is qualitatively very similar with the result obtained for the `` stretched '' p - shell state ( @xmath165 ) ( figure  [ fig : pol2a3 ] ) so that some general qualitative behaviour for the sensitivity of the @xmath185 ratio to multi - nucleon currents seems to emerge .",
    "indeed , at low missing momenta and quasi - elastic conditions the two - body currents reduce the ratio @xmath185 , an effect that slowly decreases as one goes to higher @xmath2 and is larger for knockout from `` stretched '' than from the `` jack - knifed '' single - particle orbits .",
    "finally we turn our attention to the role of the relativistic corrections ( section  [ sec : current ] ) in the one - body current operator .",
    "the dotted lines in figures  [ fig : str2e89003 ] , [ fig : str3e89003 ] and [ fig : str1e89003 ] show the calculated contributions to the cross section when neglecting the relativistic corrections in the one - body current operator , i.e. when adopting @xmath198 and @xmath199 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : redcurrent ] ) . when comparing these curves with the solid ones one can estimate the effect of the relativistic corrections in the one - body current .",
    "for the transverse responses @xmath175 and @xmath200 the foldy - wouthuysen prescription does not lead to any relativistic correction into lowest order . whereas the spin - orbit term in the charge - density operator produces rather small corrections in the longitudinal response @xmath174 in the considered kinematics , the longitudinal - transverse response @xmath201 for",
    "the `` stretched '' single - particle states @xmath165 and @xmath194 is doubled after including the relativistic corrections in the charge - density operator .",
    "a strong sensitivity of the @xmath195 response to relativistic corrections was earlier found for @xmath202 @xcite .      to our knowledge , beyond the giant resonance region",
    "no ( @xmath1 ) measurements have been made .",
    "nevertheless , neutron knockout investigations with moderate energy resolution could be done at mami , bates or tjnaf .",
    "results for neutron knockout in kinematic conditions that can be reached with electron beam energies below 1  gev are shown in figure  [ fig : een ] .",
    "these results are obtained with a neutron formfactor @xmath203=0 .",
    "the @xmath6 calculations were done in the same kinematical conditions for the ( @xmath10 ) curves of figure  [ fig : mommainz ] . the reduced cross sections for neutron knockout",
    "are subject to larger two - body current corrections than corresponding proton results . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the absolute magnitude of the two - body current contributions is comparable for proton and neutron knockout .",
    "the fact that @xmath2042 and the absence of a substantial neutron charge , however , makes them to be relatively more important in the neutron knockout channel .",
    "as could be expected on the basis of the isospin structure of the underlying current operators , the qualitative behaviour is similar for proton and neutron knockout .",
    "the net reduction of the cross sections displayed in figure  [ fig : een ] is of the order 10 - 20% .",
    "note that coupled - channel - effects between the proton knockout channels and the considerably weaker ( @xmath1 ) channels are expected to compensate largely for the loss of strength brought about by the meson and isobar degrees - of - freedom @xcite .",
    "our ( @xmath1 ) results are qualitatively similar to those reported in @xcite .",
    "the mec are observed to increase the cross section , an effect that is largely overcompensated by the isobaric current that works in the opposite direction .",
    "this reduction can be attributed to the fact that the one - body magnetization current and the isobaric current interfere destructively .      in this section",
    "we report on calculations for an @xmath132pb(@xmath10 ) experiment that was done at nikhef .",
    "this experiment was performed in very transverse kinematics ( @xmath20596@xmath206 ) at an incident electron energy of 462.14  mev and near quasi - elastic conditions ( @xmath207=161 .",

    "we have neglected the coulomb distortion effects . indeed",
    ", an exact treatment of these would imply that the two - body matrix elements of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mattwo ] ) that involve a sum over all nucleons in the target nucleus , are to be calculated for a whole range of q values .",
    "whereas calculations of this type could be performed at lower momentum transfer @xcite , the amount of multipoles required at higher momentum transfer makes it an enormous computational task .",
    "figure  [ fig : pb208 ] displays the reduced @xmath132pb(@xmath10 ) cross section for knockout from the @xmath208 and @xmath209 orbits .",
    "it becomes clear that the predicted two - nucleon effects are modest and of the same relative size in comparison with the findings for light nuclei .",
    "whereas the transparency for nucleon knockout has been established to decrease as the mass number increases @xcite the impact of the two - body currents on single - nucleon knockout appears to be rather mass independent .",
    "within the context of ongoing research activities in two - nucleon and pion production from nuclei a fair understanding of the two - nucleon currents in finite nuclei has been reached . with this knowledge",
    "the contribution of two - body currents to exclusive ( @xmath10 ) and ( @xmath1 ) reactions can be calculated with some confidence .",
