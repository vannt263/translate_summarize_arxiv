    "so far we have discussed the classical profile of the probe brane .",
    "let us now discuss the physics of the fluctuation modes on the probe . from the perspective of the dual field theory , these fluctuations are of three kinds : ( i ) scalar , ( ii ) vector and ( iii ) spinor .",
    "the scalar fluctuations are the transverse fluctuations of the probe brane embedding : @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the classical profile of the probe and @xmath50 represents the collective transverse fluctuations .",
    "the vector fluctuations correspond to the fluctuations of the classical gauge field on the probe @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the classical gauge field on the probe in equation ( [ classgauge ] ) . finally ,",
    "the spinors come from a supersymmetric counter - part of the dbi action in ( [ dbi ] ) , which schematically consists of a standard volkov - akulov type term @xmath53\\right)^{1/2 } , \\label{dbi2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 + f$ ] and the @xmath55 matrices satisfy anti - commutation relation with respect to @xmath30 $ ] : @xmath56_{ab } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] more precisely , the quadratic fluctuation term on a given d@xmath22-probe brane can be read of from @xcite .",

    "thus , the fluctuations are governed by lagrangians which take the following schematic form : @xmath61 in @xmath62 we have redefined the gamma matrices by : @xmath63 also in ( [ fscalar])-([fspinor ] ) , @xmath64 denotes an overall constant , the details of which is not relevant for us .",
    "the fields @xmath50 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 represent the various fluctuation modes and the indices @xmath67 represent the worldvolume coordinates on the probe .",
    "we have shown only the kinetic parts of the fluctuation lagrangian ; since other potential terms will not affect our conclusions .",
    "the key observation is that all these modes perceive an effective metric , denoted by @xmath60 , which is different from both the background metric @xmath68 and the induced metric @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "this is the so called _ open string metric_@xcite , which governs the dynamics of open string degrees of freedom propagating in a background geometry with an anti - symmetric @xmath69-form .",

    "the structure of the fluctuations suggests an _",

    "the various components can be given in terms of the background metric and the gauge field as @xmath74 clearly , the open string metric is non - diagonal in the @xmath75-plane .",
    "we can diagonalize this block by introducing a new coordinate system @xmath76 , which is defined as @xmath77 with this , the open string metric takes the following form @xmath78 the zeroes of @xmath79 will now determine the location of an event - horizon of the open string metric . from the definition of @xmath79 in ( [ stt ] )",
    ", we observe that the electric field results in an event horizon of the open string metric at the location @xmath80 , which is obtained by solving ( [ ustar ] ) .",
    "subsequently , the open string equivalence principle implies an universal effective temperature in the probe sector .",
    "we can read off this temperature by requiring regularity of the euclidean open string metric and compactifying the @xmath81-direction .",
    "note that , we can not make euclidean @xmath68 and euclidean @xmath60 regular simultaneously since their respective horizons do not coincide , which implies that the background and the probe sector are not in a thermal equilibrium .",

    "assuming @xmath90 , from ( [ teff ] ) it is clear that the sufficient condition to violate @xmath91 is to have @xmath92 , which will violate weak energy condition for the matter field on the classical probe profile .",
    "this is expected intuitively , since maintaining the steady - state continually pumps energy into the system and the resulting @xmath3 should be greater than @xmath1 . in the presence of a non - trivial @xmath93 , this inequality @xmath7 is not always true@xcite .",
    "the propagation of fluctuations in a dbi - background can be analyzed using the method of boillat ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite and @xcite for a more recent discussion ) .",
    "subsequently , it can be shown that the open string causal structure is determined by the boillat metric , which belongs to the same conformal class as the open string metric .",
    "typically , the boillat light - cone lies inside the einstein light - cone as long as an weak energy condition is satisfied by the matter field on the probe@xcite .",
    "this light cone structure is another manifestation of the @xmath91 inequality .",
    "this effective temperature is accompanied by an effective entropy as well . in @xcite",
    "the helmholtz free energy for such an ness probe system was conjectured for a particular system .",
    "before we generalize the proposal in @xcite , let us offer some comments regarding the validity of our analysis .",
    "the basic statement of gauge - gravity duality can be succinctly phrased as below : @xmath94 where @xmath95 corresponds to the _ bulk gravity path integral _ and @xmath96 is the field theory path integral .",
    "the quantity @xmath95 is defined as @xmath97 here @xmath98 is the @xmath9 or @xmath99-dimensional supergravity action which gives rise to the metric solution in ( [ metgen ] ) .",
    "generically , form fields of various ranks will also be present in the background .",
    "however , as we have mentioned before , these form fields will not affect our conclusions .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath100 represents the action of the probe in ( [ dbi ] ) . in terms of the gravitational description , @xmath101 since it originates from the closed string sector , whereas @xmath102 , which originates from the open string sector . clearly , the total path integral factorizes into the gravitational part and the probe part .",
    "following @xcite , or more recently @xcite , it can be argued that stringy physics can be decoupled from a purely ( super)gravity one in which one can use the gauge - gravity duality safely , as long as the curvature scale is sufficiently small compared to the string scale and the local string coupling is small enough .",
    "it is also argued in @xcite , that in the limit the local string coupling grows , one may be able to use an s - dual description or an m - theory uplift and subsequently use the corresponding gravitational description to explore the strongly coupled regime of the dual field theory . at any rate ,",
    "there exists a range of energy , for which a classical gravity dual description is valid .",
    "now , as long as we have a classical gravitational description , we can certainly probe the geometry provided @xmath103 .",
    "however this condition may be too naive .",
    "in reality , in order for a brane to be a legitimate probe of a background , one needs to compute the stress - energy tensor coming from the probe , denoted by @xmath104 , to the einstein tensor of the background , denoted by @xmath105 and impose : @xmath106 the non - trivial ingredient that enters the relation in ( [ probecond ] ) is the radial - scale of the background geometry , which can override the @xmath103 limit .",
    "now , it can also be checked , _ e.g. _  if we place @xmath21 number of d@xmath107-brane probe in the near horizon geometry of a stack of d@xmath22-branes@xcite , the condition in ( [ probecond ] ) is satisfied , at least in a non - vanishing range of the energy scale ( a detailed account will appear in @xcite ) .",
    "this essentially means that we can use the purely classical gravitational description and the probe sector _",
    "path integral _ is completely determined by the classical dirac - born - infeld contribution ( there may be wess - zumino term , but it would not change our conclusions ) . by now , this has become a common practice in gauge - gravity duality , see _ e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "now , let us comment on @xmath96 .",
    "gauge - gravity duality states that the gravitational part is dual to the adjoint sector of the large @xmath108-gauge theory and the probe sector corresponds to the fundamental flavour that has been introduced in the probe limit .",
    "likewise , we have @xmath109 here , typically @xmath110 and corresponds to the adjoint sector , while @xmath111 corresponds to the fundamental sector . at this point",
    ", one can expect that the fundamental sector is a legitimate probe in the limit @xmath103 , however , the legitimacy of the probe limit can depend on the energy - scale of the theory .",
    "recall , that the t hooft coupling is generally dimensionful , so it can set the energy - scale where back - reaction by the flavour sector becomes important .",
    "this is precisely the dual realization of the more stringent condition in ( [ probecond ] ) . and ,",
    "as we have argued just below equation ( [ probecond ] ) , for a large class of examples , there exists at least a non - vanishing energy - range for which the probe limit is perfectly legitimate . for such cases ,",
    "the qft path integral also factorizes between the adjoint sector and the fundamental sector .",
    "now we can introduce the standard trick of thermal field theory : first euclideanize the time direction and then compactify on it .",
    "finally the path integral is identified with the partition function and the period of the resulting @xmath112 is identified with the inverse temperature of the system .",
    "note , here we can impose two different periodicities for the adjoint and the fundamental sector , respectively .",
    "these two periodicities correspond to regularity condition of the euclidean closed - string metric in ( [ metgen ] ) and the regularity of the open string metric in ( [ osmmet ] ) .",
    "since the modes in ( [ fscalar])-([fspinor ] ) on the probe perceive the open string metric , we will focus on the latter .",
    "now we are ready to discuss the resulting _ thermodynamic _ description for the probe .",
    "we can generalize the proposal of @xcite for the current situation .",
    "let us work with the euclidean action , which we denote by @xmath113 : @xmath114 which can be obtained from ( [ dbi ] ) after substituting the ansatz for the gauge field in ( [ classgauge ] ) and then euclideanizing the resulting action .",
    "note that , all other constants and volume factors have been absorbed in the constant @xmath115 .",
    "evidently , variation of this action yields @xmath116 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where  horizon \" and  boundary \" respectively stand for the osm horizon and the conformal boundary .",
    "generically , we can impose @xmath117 , and subsequently we need to subtract off the boundary contribution coming from @xmath118 .",
    "the boundary - terms - subtracted on - shell euclidean action is then given by @xmath119 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the definition of @xmath40 from ( [ defj ] ) .",
    "thus the general proposal for the corresponding helmholtz free energy is given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 is given in ( [ lagon ] ) .",
    "we have evidently written down the expression in the full @xmath9-dimensional geometry .",
    "it can be noted that the conjectured free energy is essentially a legendre transformation of the on - shell euclidean probe action .",
    "the associated effective entropy is now given by @xmath122 note that , the boundary term in ( [ thermosteady ] ) contributes non - trivially in the entropy of the system .    before leaving this section ,",
    "let us ponder over an interesting observation .",
    "assuming that @xmath123 has a simple zero , where the closed string event horizon is located , it can be verified that @xmath124 where @xmath125 denotes the closed string event horizon , @xmath81 is a typical time - scale and @xmath126 .",
    "this time - scale  which has a logarithmic divergence  can be identified with the time light rays take to travel from the conformal boundary to the background event horizon .",
    "intriguingly , this time - scale appears in an ohmic dissipation term when the boundary term in ( [ thermosteady ] ) is evaluated at the closed string horizon . by evaluating this boundary term at the osm horizon",
    ", we are ir - safe in ( [ thermosteady ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , there is a natural candidate for a bekenstein - hawking type area formula involving the open string data @xmath127 . recall that a probe action scales as @xmath128 , where @xmath72 is the closed string coupling .",
    "thus , the natural area - law candidate is given by @xmath129 where @xmath130 is an undetermined constant and @xmath131 denotes the area of the open string metric event horizon .",
    "also note that both @xmath71 and @xmath131 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath17 . for a conformal theory beyond @xmath132 ,",
    "the bekenstein - hawking area formula indeed is proportional to the thermodynamic entropy obtained from ( [ thermosteady ] ) .",
    "this , however , is a simple consequence of conformal invariance . in general , ( [ ose ] ) does not yield the thermodynamic entropy obtained from ( [ thermosteady ] ) .",
    "in fact it has a different scaling behaviour with respect to the temperature",

    "one of the profound consequences of the open string equivalence principle is the existence of a fluctuation - dissipation relation involving the effective temperature . in a system at thermal equilibrium , fluctuation - dissipation relations connect the linear relaxation response of the system to a small perturbation around the equilibrium configuration . in @xcite",

    "were arrived at using probe branes rotating along the compact directions , which inherits an event horizon on the worldvolume .",
    "it is known that for probe brane systems , t - duality symmetry of string theory transforms a spatial boost of the brane to a gauge field on the worldvolume .",
    "thus , our ness is qualitatively a t - dual description of @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that an underlying thermodynamic principle relates two seemingly unrelated systems by translating the induced metric horizon to an open string metric horizon .",
    "this perhaps also insinuates the deep connection between geometry and thermodynamics@xcite that may go beyond einstein gravity . for a recent article involving both an electric field and a rotation on the worldvolume ,",
    "see @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", our analysis suggests that for systems out - of - equilibrium and at least in a steady - state , an effective thermal description emerges rather universally .",
    "this is evidently true for a probe sector in a large-@xmath0 gauge theory with a holographic dual , irrespective of any further details of the system .",
    "interestingly , a thermal nature for an inherently nonequilibrium process has also been observed elsewhere : earlier in @xcite-@xcite , in quantum critical systems , _",
    "@xcite , or in aging glass system@xcite .",
    "these observations perhaps suggest a more ubiquitous presence of an effective thermodynamic description for systems out - of - equilibrium , even outside the lore of gauge - gravity duality .    by construction ,",
    "our holographic analysis is applicable for a fundamental probe sector in a large-@xmath0 @xmath15 gauge theory .",
    "more recent progress on holography has made it possible to understand gravitational dual descriptions for @xmath168-type gauge theories , which was originally proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is an intriguing question whether such an effective thermodynamics persists for an analogous ness situation there .",
    "our discussions have also been limited to the probe limit . beyond this limit , the probe ( fundamental ) sector and the background ( adjoint ) undergoes heat exchange since @xmath7 .",
    "eventually , after the electric field is turned off , they will reach a thermal equilibrium .",
    "this should be realized as the open string equivalence principle merging with the closed string equivalence principle and having the same event horizon in the end .",
    "it will be very interesting to explicitly construct such a time - dependent geometric example where this physics is manifest , perhaps along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to sumit das , jacques distler , willy fischler , vadim kaplunovsky , hong liu , gautam mandal , bala sathiapalan and julian sonner for useful discussions and encouragements about this work .",
