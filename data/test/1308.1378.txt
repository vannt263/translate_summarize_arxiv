    "quantum state discrimination is one of the most basic yet fundamental tasks in quantum information  @xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "it consists in a protocol that tells in which out of two given states a quantum system was prepared .",
    "this is a primitive of great practical interest that has been investigated from many perspectives and for which many key results have been obtained .",
    "theoretical results also abound in the literature , e.g. , state discrimination provides an operational distance between any two states  @xcite based on the degree of difficulty of telling one from the other .",
    "it has also been shown that for multiple copies of pure states there exist individual adaptive measurements on each copy that provide exactly the same discrimination power as the optimal ( global ) measurement strategy  @xcite .",
    "this is however not so for mixed states , and there is numerical evidence that even the corresponding asymptotic exponential error rates are different in this case  @xcite .",
    "generically , a discrimination protocol , to which we will refer throughout the paper as _ device _ , _ machine _ or more explicitly as _ discriminator _ , is not universal but specifically designed for each given pair of possible states .",
    "a significant conceptual twist on discrimination was introduced in  @xcite , where devices that work for arbitrary pairs of states were considered .",
    "these machines have two program ports through which multiple copies of the unknown quantum states are loaded ( `` the programs , '' for short )",
    ". multiple copies of a third state ( guaranteed to coincide with one of the states loaded through the program ports ) are fed into the data port of the machine .",
    "this so - called _ programmable discriminator _ is designed to report whether the state of the data is that of the first program , or whether it is that of the second program .",
    "the discrimination protocol exploits the difference between the permutation symmetry of the global state of the three ports in the two alternatives .",
    "these machines work for discrete  @xcite as well as for continuous variable systems  @xcite .",
    "programmable discriminators can be regarded as machine - learning devices .",
    "it has recently been shown that , in some settings , optimal performance can be attained with a suitable measurement on the two programs followed by a measurement on the data , where only classical communication between the two separate measurements is required . not only does this mean an important saving of resources , as conventional memory suffices to store the ( classical ) output of the first measurement , but also that programmable discriminators can be reused and still exhibit optimal performance without having to reload the program ports  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , programmable discrimination is also formally equivalent to a change - point problem @xcite .",
    "let us assume that a source produces states of an unknown type and that either at time @xmath0 or at time @xmath1 the same source starts producing states of a different type .",
    "the change - point problem consists in identifying whether the time at which the change occurs is @xmath0  or  @xmath1 .    in most of the literature",
    "so far either the minimum - error or the unambiguous discrimination scheme is considered . in the former",
    ", the discriminator always produces a conclusive answer about the identity of the input state , but sometimes this answer is wrong . in the unambiguous scheme",
    "no error is allowed , that is , the input state must be correctly identified with certainty .",
    "this can only happen at the expense of producing some inconclusive answers or , in other words , the machine sometimes must _ abstain _",
    "@xcite from giving an answer . in both cases optimality means that the machine attains maximum success probability .",
    "it is clear that , if we relax the unambiguous scheme by tolerating some error rate , we can increase the success probability . likewise , by allowing some rate of inconclusive answers in the minimum - error scheme , we can also increase the reliability of the answers .",
    "hence by introducing an error margin we can unify minimum - error and unambiguous discrimination .",
    "both become extremal points of the unified discrimination with error margin scheme  @xcite . interpolating between these two extemal cases may have practical interest in some situations . in this paper",
    "we combine the two concepts above and analyze the optimal performance of a qubit multiple - copy programmable machine when an error rate is allowed .",
    "we will show that by relaxing the zero error condition slightly the resulting scheme provides an important enhancement in performance over the widely used unambiguous scheme .",
    "we will first review the standard problem , when the states between which we wish to discriminate are known . for the sake of self - containedness",
    ", we will rederive the success probability for a given error margin in both the so - called weak and strong senses .",
    "we will then present our results for programmable devices and obtain the analytical expression of the success probability as a function of the error margins .",
    "we will discuss our results in a separate section and will end the paper by stating our conclusions .",
    "consider two pure nonorthogonal states @xmath2 , @xmath3 as hypotheses of a standard two - state discrimination problem , where for simplicity we assign equal prior probabilities to each state .",
    "the discrimination with an error margin protocol can be thought of as a generalized measurement on the system , described mathematically by a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) with three elements @xmath4 , where the operator @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is associated to the statement `` the measured state is @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , '' whereas @xmath9 is associated to the inconclusive answer or abstention .",

    "the relation @xmath13 is guaranteed by the povm condition  @xmath14 .",
    "the optimal discrimination with an error margin protocol is obtained by maximizing the success probability @xmath15 over any possible povm  @xmath16 that satisfies that certain errors occur with a probability not exceeding the given margin .",
    "generically , these conditions imply a nonvanishing value of the inconclusive probability @xmath17 .    in this paper , we consider two error margin conditions : _ weak _ and _ strong_. the weak condition states that the _ average _ error probability can not exceed a margin ,  i.e. , @xmath18 \\le   r \\,.\\ ] ] the strong condition imposes a margin on the probabilities of misidentifying _ each _ possible state , i.e. , @xmath19 p(\\rho_1|e_2)&=&\\frac{{{\\rm tr}\\,}(e_2\\rho_1)}{{{\\rm tr}\\,}(e_2\\rho_1)+{{\\rm tr}\\,}(e_2\\rho_2 ) } \\le r \\label{strong2}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the probabilities that the state identified as @xmath7 is actually @xmath8 and the other way around , respectively .",
    "the strong condition is obviously more restrictive , as it sets a margin on both types of errors separately .",
    "however , as we will see , the two conditions are directly related : the strong one just corresponds to the weak one with a tighter error margin  @xcite . note that both error margin schemes have the unambiguous ( when  @xmath22 ) and the minimum - error schemes ( when  @xmath23 is large enough ) as extremal cases .",
    "we will denote by @xmath24 the critical margin above which the success probability does not increase and thus coincides with that of ( the unrestricted ) minimum - error discrimination .    , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 as in eqs .",

    "when the error margin coincides with , or is larger than , the minimum error ,  , one has @xmath45 ( no abstention ) and @xmath5 becomes orthogonal to @xmath6 , i.e. ,  @xmath46 . in this range",

    "let us elaborate on the definition of a programmable discriminator given in the introduction .",
    "it is a device capable of identifying the state of a system ( a qubit in our case ) that is guaranteed to be prepared in one of two possible _ unknown _ pure states , say  @xmath65 . by unknown we mean that we lack all the information about their preparation .",
    "instead , we assume that we are supplied with  @xmath66 copies of each of them , which can be fed into the device through two program ports labeled @xmath67 and  @xmath68 for  @xmath43 and  @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "in addition , a third port  @xmath69 is loaded with  @xmath70 copies of the state to be identified .",
    "a programmable discriminator is assumed to be a universal device and it should thus work for any pair of states  @xmath71 . to make this",
    "paper self - contained , in this section we review the state of the art of this discrimination problem .",
    "a more general and detailed analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a programmable discriminator is defined by a universal povm with three elements  @xmath4 .",
    "the operator @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) corresponds to the machine assigning the label 1 ( 2 ) to the copies in @xmath69 , meaning that their state is identical to that of the copies in  @xmath67  ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "once again , the third operator , @xmath9 , is associated to an inconclusive result .",
    "the optimal @xmath16 is that which maximizes the averaged probability of success , @xmath72 where  @xmath73 is the success probability for a given pair of states @xmath65 and the average is taken over all possible pairs .",
    "since @xmath16 is state independent , @xmath15 can be recast as the success probability of discrimination between the two effective global states ( of the three - partite port system @xmath74 ) when the state in @xmath69 is either  @xmath43 or  @xmath44 .",

    "for the last one , we have  @xmath209 , which holds for any value of @xmath120 , provided @xmath210 . this must be so , since we recall that the projections of @xmath88 and @xmath79 onto the subspace with maximum angular momentum are indistinguishable . clearly , allowing for @xmath211",
    "while there is still room for the other margins to increase can not be optimal .    also noticeable in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is that the set of strong margins that have not reached their critical value @xmath133 has a flat profile ( this does not apply to @xmath212 that is always frozen to its critical value of  @xmath169 ) . to provide an explanation for this ,",
    "we write the equality in  eq .  , which is attained if @xmath213 , as  @xmath214 , using once again the symmetry of the problem .",
    "we next write the success and error probabilities as a convex sum over  @xmath131 and use the equality in the strong conditions  ( [ strong1 ] ) and  ( [ strong2 ] ) for each subspace @xmath111 to express  @xmath215 in terms of  @xmath216 .",
    "we obtain the strong condition @xmath217 = 0 .\\ ] ] the terms in square brackets can be positive or negative depending on @xmath218 being smaller or larger than @xmath120 , both of which are possible .",
    "so , at face value , this equation can not explain the flat profile of @xmath192 and more work is needed .",
    "next , we use the lagrange multiplier method to maximize @xmath219 and note that the dependence of  @xmath216 on  @xmath131 ( i.e. , the term @xmath220 ) factorizes , as can be checked from eq .",
    "( [ strong ] ) . without further calculation",
    ", we can anticipate that the optimal margins will be determined by @xmath154 equations of the form @xmath221 , where @xmath222 can be a function only of @xmath120 , the lagrange multiplier and the number of margins below their critical value .",
    "hence , all the ( unfrozen ) margins will have the same optimal value .",
    "for @xmath223 ( no frozen margins ) we have the simple solution @xmath224 for all  @xmath131 , and the corresponding success probability is @xmath225 for a sufficiently small strong margin @xmath120 .",
    "in this paper , we have provided two generalizations of programmable state discrimination that enable control on the rate with which errors inevitably arise because of the very principles of quantum mechanics . in the first",
    ", a margin is set on the average error probability of mislabeling the input data states ( weak condition ) . in the second",
    ", a more stringent condition is required that , for each label , the probability of it being wrongly assigned is within a given margin ( strong condition ) .",
    "generically , in both cases , the discrimination protocol may result sometimes in an inconclusive outcome ( i.e. , in being unable to assign a label to the data ) .",
    "we have shown that there is a one - to - one correspondence between these two margins , so that weak and strong conditions turn out to be the same if their margins are related by a simple equation .",
    "these generalizations extend the range of applicability of programmable discriminators to scenarios where some rate of errors and some rate of inconclusive outcomes are both affordable ; or more specifically , to situations where a trade - off between these two rates is acceptable , which departs from the standard unambiguous ( zero error ) and minimum - error ( zero abstention ) discrimination scenarios .",
    "our results include the analytical expression of the success probability for the optimal programmable device as a function of both weak and strong error margins , as well as the characterization of the povm that specifies such optimal device . from the analysis of these results ,",
    "we conclude that small error margins can significantly boost the success probability ; i.e. , a small departure from the unambiguous scheme can translate into an important increase of the success rate while still having very reliable results ( very low error rate ) .",
    "we provide an example of this , where a mere error margin value of  @xmath226 adds about @xmath227 to the success probability . a future extension of this work is , e.g. , the asymptotic analysis of programmable discrimination with an error margin , when the data and/or program ports are fed with an asymptotically large number of copies . also relevant",
    "is the analysis of programmable discriminators when the measurement is restricted to those compatible with a machine learning scenario .",
    "these devices require only classical memory to store the information about the state of the programs , and use it in a later test stage to fix the measurement on the unknown data .",
    "they can be reused an arbitrary number of times without reloading the program ports  @xcite .",
