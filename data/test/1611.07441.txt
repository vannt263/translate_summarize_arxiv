    "a curve @xmath7 denotes a continuous map from a domain @xmath8 that is either an interval @xmath9 $ ] or a circle @xmath10 to a manifold @xmath11 , with the curve being called _ closed _ in the latter case .",
    "such a curve is called _ simple _ if @xmath12 is injective .    a recent survey on this problem , together with an extensive list of further references may be found in @xcite ; the brief summary below is drawn from that survey .",
    "thanks to arguments of a homological nature , the above conjecture is known assuming that the curve @xmath12 is sufficiently regular . for instance :    * toeplitz @xcite claimed conjecture [ spp ] for convex curves , but did not publish a proof .",

    "one can broadly classify the methods of proof in the above positive results as being `` homological '' in nature , in that they use algebraic topology tools such as intersection homology , bordism , equivariant obstruction theory , or more elementary parity arguments counting the number of intersections between curves .",
    "in fact , many of these proofs establish the stronger claim that ( under some suitable genericity and regularity hypotheses ) there are an _ odd _ number of squares with vertices lying on the curve .",
    "it is tempting to attack the general case of conjecture [ spp ] by approximating the curve @xmath12 by a curve in one of the above classes , applying an existing result to produce squares with vertices on the approximating curve , and then taking limits somehow ( e.g. by a compactness argument ) . however , in the absence of some additional regularity hypothesis on the curve , it could conceivably happen that the approximating inscribed squares degenerate to a point in the limit .",
    "even if the original curve is smooth except for a single singular point , one could imagine that all squares in the approximating curves concentrate into that singular point in the limit .",
    "this scenario of squares degenerating to a point is the primary reason for the inability to remove the regularity hypotheses in the known positive results on the problem .    in this paper",
    "we propose to modify the homological approach to the inscribed square problem , by focusing not only on the parity of intersections between various geometric objects associated to the curve @xmath12 , but also on bounding certain integrals associated to these curves . as with previous works ,",
    "one requires a certain amount of regularity ( such as rectifiability , lipschitz continuity , or piecewise linearity ) on the curves in order to initially define these integrals ; but the integrals enjoy more stability properties under limits than intersection numbers , and thus may offer a route to establish more cases of conjecture [ spp ] . as an instance of this",

    "conjecture [ spp ] holds for curves that traverse two lipschitz graphs , as long as the lipschitz constants are strictly less than one .",
    "the condition of having lipschitz constant less than one is related to the property of being locally monotone , as considered in the references @xcite , @xcite above ; however , due to a potentially unbounded amount of oscillation at the endpoints @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the sets in theorem [ main ] are not necessarily locally monotone at the endpoints , and so the results in @xcite , @xcite do not seem to directly imply theorem [ main ] .",

    "we prove theorem [ main ] in section [ pos - sec ] . a key concept in the proof",
    "will be the notion of the ( signed ) area @xmath35 under a rectifiable curve @xmath12 ; see definition [ area - def ] .",
    "this area can be used to construct a `` conserved integral of motion '' when one traverses the vertices of a continuous family of squares ; see lemma [ conserv ] .",

    "in contrast to the original square problem , the periodic version remains open even when the curves are piecewise linear ( and this case seems to contain most of the essential difficulties of the problem ) .",

    "the logical chain of dependencies between the conjectures discussed in this paper is summarised as follows : @xmath38    the author is supported by nsf grant dms-1266164 , the james and carol collins chair , and by a simons investigator award .",
