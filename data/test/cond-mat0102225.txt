    "the surface - force apparatus developed by tabor and winterton ( 1969 ) and further refined by israelachvili and adams ( 1978 ) , klein ( 1983 ) and parker _ et al . _",
    "( 1989 , ) has proven useful for the measurement of colloidal forces between atomically smooth transparent surfaces in liquid and gases at molecular scale . in these classical apparatii",
    "the distance between the surfaces is measured by the interferometry of white light fringes ( fringes of equal chromatic order , feco ) .",
    "this technique allows to measure steady or slowly varying distances , with a resolution of a few @xmath1 .",
    "chan ( 1985 ) has employed videocameras to record rapidly changing position of the surfaces with a time resolution about @xmath2 , during the drainage of a fluid out of the contact region .",
    "recently , this interferometric method has been improved ( grunewaled ( 1996 ) ) by using expensive high speed video treatments .",
    "the first method proposed for doing a dynamical measurement was to use a piezoelectric bimorph ( van alsten ( 1988 ) , israelachvili ( 1989 ) , peachey ( 1991 ) ) , which has also the advantage of allowing opaque surfaces to be used .",
    "although parker ( 1992 ) showed that a bimorph can be used to take a measurement from less than a tenth of a second to several minutes , these devices are unsuitable for measurements that take place over many minutes or hours .",
    "furthermore , the single - cantilever construction of the bimorph implies that a displacement of his head results also in an angular rotation .",
    "the resulting shear motion makes it unsuitable for the measurement of adhesive forces .",
    "recently the use of a capacitor dilatometry attachment for the conventional surface - force apparatus has been proposed by stewart ( 1992 ) for statics measurements with a resolution of @xmath3 .",
    "( 1988 , 1989 ) described a surface forces apparatus in which they used capacitors to obtain both the distance and the interaction force between a sphere and a plane .",
    "this apparatus is suitable for non tranparent surfaces and dynamical study of confined liquids .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new method for measuring displacement at the nanometer scale in surface force apparatus , based on a capacitor included in an oscillator . unlike the capacitive sensor proposed by steward ( 2000 ) or franz et al .",
    "( 1996,1997 ) , our method for the capacitance measurement is a low cost method which does not require the use of a lock - in amplifier , without loss in resolution or dynamic performances . from the point of view of surface forces measurements ,",
    "the method has the advantages of being linear on a large scale , of allowing mesasurements between non transparent surfaces , and is suitable for dynamical measurements . when used in conjunction with an interferometric technique ( crassous _ in preparation _ ) for the purpose of calibration , this sensor can be used to perform nanorheological measurements or contact forces measurements between the surfaces .",
    "a schematic diagram of the surface forces apparatus is given in figure [ fig : sfa_plan ] .",
    "this apparatus has several features which distinguish it from the common sfa .",
    "first of all , the surfaces are not necessary transparent , since the sfa does not use the feco technique .",
    "the surfaces are usually a sphere and a plane .",
    "the plane surface is mounted on the left - hand double - cantilever @xmath4 of stiffness @xmath5 .",
    "an optical interferometer measures the deflection of @xmath4 to obtain directly the force measurements .",
    "the sphere is mounted on the right - hand double - cantilever @xmath6 and can be moved in the direction normal to the plane .",
    "the cantilever @xmath6 prevents the rolling of the surfaces .",
    "the sphere motion is controlled by three actuactors .",
    "the first one is a motorized microscrew driven by a stepping motor .",
    "it allows a displacement of @xmath7  nm to @xmath8  cm and is used for a rough positionning of the sphere .",
    "the second actuator is a piezoelectric actuator which allows a continuous approach of the two surfaces with a velocity range of @xmath9 to @xmath10  nm.s@xmath11 .",
    "the last piezoelectric actuator is designed to add a small sinusoidal motion in to study the dynamic behavior of the sphere - plane interactions .",
    "the relative displacement between the sphere and the plane , @xmath12 , is determined by the capacitive sensor described in this article .",
    "finally , in order to calibrate the capacitive sensor , a permanent magnet mounted on the cantilever @xmath4 is located in the magnetic field gradient produced by a little coil of copper wire .",
    "this setup allows to calibrate the sensor over a large range of displacement ( @xmath13  @xmath14 m ) .",
    "all these devices are controlled by a hewlett packard vxi 743 computer equiped with a e1421a 16 channels a / d and d / a converters .",
    "a more complete description of this apparatus will be given in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the measurement capacitor consists of two duraluminium discs with a radius @xmath15 and a thickness @xmath16 .",
    "the typical distance between the plates is typically @xmath17",
    "@xmath18 and the surfaces have been polished to have a roughness smaller than the sistance between the two plates of the capacitor . one plate is fixed on the cantilever supporting the plane @xmath4 , and the other on the cantilever supporting the sphere @xmath6 so that when the surfaces are brought together , the plates of the capacitor do also .",
    "parallel alignment of the plates is obtained with a mechanical ball - and - socket joint which is rigidly screwed after the plates have been pushed in contact to obtain the parallelism .",
    "the terminals of the capacitor plates are connected to the oscillator with thin copper leads whose compliance is much higher than the one of the cantilever . to decrease the viscous drag induced by the air flow between the plates of the capacitor , some holes are drilled in the moving plate .",
    "the weight of the capacitor , which is important for the resonant frequency of our surface force apparatus is roughly @xmath19 .",
    "the capacitance @xmath20 of this sensor is typically @xmath21  pf and its serial resistance about @xmath22 .    in order to measure the capacitance variations of this sensor ,",
    "we include it in an oscillator .",
    "we use a clapp oscillator containing two fixed capacitor @xmath23 , the variable capacitor @xmath20 , and an inductance @xmath24 ( figure [ fig : oscillateur ] ) . the clapp oscillator is known to have a good stability and to be easy to build ( audouin ( 1991 ) ) . neglecting the leads capacitances and straight capacitances ,",
    "the frequency of the oscillations of the clapp oscillator is  : @xmath25    this formula can be used to have an estimation of the nominal frequency and of the sensitivity of the sensor . using the typical values @xmath26 , @xmath27  pf and @xmath28h",
    ", we have a typical frequency of @xmath29  mhz and a typical sensitivity of the order of @xmath13  hz /  .",
    "this shows that in order to have a precision of @xmath30  nm on the displacement measurement , we have to read frequency variations of @xmath31  hz .",
    "for this purpose , we use a hewlett packard hp53132a counter which reaches this precision with an acquisition time of less than @xmath9  s. we emphasize that reading one part in @xmath32 is really easy in a frequency measurement but is difficult and expensive in voltage measurements .",
    "the conventional way to make a distance measurement with this device is first to fix the distance between the capacitor s plates at a distance comprised between @xmath33 and @xmath34 and to calibrate the sensitivity for small displacements around this distance .",
    "indeed we do not use equation ( [ equ : freq ] ) to determine the sensitivity of the sensor , since this latter depends slightly on the angular parallelism of the capacitors plates . in order to calibrate the sensor",
    ", we use an interferometer , which is mounted on our sfa ( schonenberger ( 1989 ) ) and allows to perform easy calibrations .",
    "the detailed procedure is as follows : the rhs cantilever @xmath6 is fixed , a force is applied on the cantilever @xmath4 by the mean of the coil / magnet system .",
    "the deflection of @xmath4 results in a displacement @xmath35 of the sensor s plate . fixed on @xmath4 , as well as of the mirror .",
    "the interferometer gives access to the absolute value of @xmath35 , and the calibration is done by plotting @xmath36 , the frequency of the oscillator as a function of @xmath35 . in order to reduce the noise ( see paragraph [ sec : noise ] ) , we usually integrate the frequency signal over a time of @xmath13  s. fig .",
    "[ fig : f_x ] shows the calibration over a displacement range of @xmath37  nm .",
    "one can see that the capacitive sensor is very linear .",
    "the typical maximum deviation to linearity over this scale is lower than @xmath38 of the total excursion range .",
    "the measured sensitivity is :  7.70  hz.@xmath11 .",
    "this is closed to the estimated value deduce from equation ( [ equ : freq ] ) but take into account all the straight capacitances .",
    "the capacitance measuring circuit is in fact sensitive to stray capacitance between the upper sensing electrode and ground .",
    "therefore the value @xmath20 of the capacitance in equation ( 1 ) includes not only the sensor capacitance , but also the value of stray capacitances , the larger of which is the capacitance of the screen cable connecting the sensor to the circuit .",
    "the order of magnitude of those stray capacitances can be estimated by increasing the distance between the capacitor electrodes up to the point where it does not affect anymore the frequency of the oscillator .",
    "the overall value of the stray capacitance can be as large as @xmath39 .    during the typical time of an experiment in a sfa ( typically 30 mn ) and with the environment conditions required by the sfa itself (",
    "the sfa is located in a separated closed room where nobody enters during an experiment ; signal acquisition and experiment control are performed from another room ) , it turns out that the overall stray capacitance does not change significantly except for smooth drifts which can not be distinguished from the thermal drift of the measuring circuit itself ( see hereafter ) . significant change of the stray capacitance occur usually other large period of time ( one day ) or when a change is made on the sensor ( tuning of the distance or orientation of the electrodes , change in the location of the oscillator ) .",
    "therefore , the sensitivity of the sensor is periodically calibrated with the interferometer , in order to take in account the changes in sensitivity induced by the modification of the value of the stray capacitance .      without any displacement imposed on the cantilevers , we can measure the noise and the thermal drift in a typical situation .",
    "those quantities will limit the static performance of our apparatus and the thermal drift must be corrected to obtain an accurate measurement of the relative displacement of the surfaces .",
    "figure [ fig : vibration_noise_freq ] shows a typical record of the signal given by the counter converted in displacement .",
    "the noise is less @xmath9  nm peak to peak .",
    "this is due to the mechanical vibrations on the cantilever @xmath4 . with a simple plexiglass cover over the entire instrument and without any temperature control",
    "we find a drift rate smaller than @xmath40  nm / s .",
    "this drift is of the same order as the drift reported in other articles ( schonenberger ( 1989 ) ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to inquire about the electrostatic attractive forces between the charged plates of this plane capacitor . in general the force",
    "is given by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the average of the square voltage between the capacitor s plates , @xmath43 the plates area and @xmath44 the dielectric permittivity of vacuum .",
    "the force is @xmath45  @xmath14n for typical values @xmath17",
    "@xmath14 m and @xmath46  v. this force is nearly constant over one experiment since the relative displacement of the plates is always much smaller than @xmath47 .",
    "a piezoelectric crystal is used to add a sinusoidal motion ( tonck ( 1988 ) ) of small amplitude on cantilever @xmath6 in order to determine the dynamic behaviour of the sphere - plane interaction .",
    "the distance between the surfaces is thus @xmath12 with @xmath12 being the sum of two components : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a slowly varying function of time ( @xmath50  nm / s ) .",
    "this results in a modulation of the frequency of the capacitive sensor .",
    "this harmonic frequency modulation can not be read with the counter when @xmath51 is larger than @xmath13  hz .",
    "we built a high - resolution frequency to voltage converter to read this distance modulation between the surfaces .",
    "the diagram of this converter is drawn on figure [ fig : pll ] .",
    "the principle of the operation is as follows : the high frequency signal ( frequency @xmath52 ) is multiplied by a reference signal generated by a stable function generator hp31320a ( frequency @xmath53 ) .",
    "the output signal is a combination of signals at @xmath54 and higher frequency signals .",
    "it is first passed through a low - pass filter then directed to a frequency to voltage converter built with a digital phase - lock - loop with a range of @xmath55  hz and a sensitivity of @xmath56  v.hz@xmath11 .",
    "this frequency - shift technique allows to obtain a high sensitivity in the conversion which could not be directly obtained with a phase lock loop .",
    "the final sensitivity on the @xmath57 displacement is @xmath58  v.nm@xmath11 .",
    "the output voltage is connected on a digital two - phase lock - in amplifier ( standford research system sr830 dsp lock in amplifier ) whose reference signal is the signal used to drive the piezoelectric element ( see figure [ fig : ftov_principle ] ) .",
    "the dynamical response of the displacement sensor can be obtained with the same procedure as the static calibration .",
    "a white noise excitation containing all the frequencies in the range @xmath0  hz is applied on the cantilever @xmath4 by the mean of the coil / magnet system .",
    "the frequency response of the capacitive sensor is calibrated by the frequency response of the interferometer mounted on @xmath4 , whose response is flat in amplitude and frequency .",
    "this also allows a dynamical calibration of the displacement sensor .    the electrical noise of the capacitive sensor converted in distance is less than @xmath13  pm.hz@xmath59 in the range 0 - 100  hz , except in the range @xmath60  hz , where the noise of the electronics is bigger than a few pm.hz@xmath59 .",
    "since the dynamic experiments are usually made at a given frequency , this frequency must be chosen not to close to the line frequency .",
    "the mechanical noise on the displacement sensor ( figure [ fig : vibration_spectrum ] is due to the mechanical vibrations on the cantilever @xmath4 and are much more important than the electronic noise .",
    "in this experiments , we use a sphere of @xmath61  mm in diameter and a plane made of pyrex .",
    "the surfaces are washed in an ultrasound bath with distilled water and a detergent soap for more than an hour .",
    "the surfaces are then rinsed with propanol purified at @xmath62 .",
    "finally the surfaces are passed in a flame in order to burn out the last amount of pollution and to flatten the surfaces .",
    "the total roughness of this surfaces measured by an atomic force microscope is less than @xmath63  nm rms on a 1  @xmath14m@xmath64 square .",
    "the surfaces are quickly mounted on the apparatus .    a small drop of an organic liquid : @xmath65-dodecane obtained from acros organics , is placed between the surfaces .",
    "dodecane is a simple , newtonian , non polar liquid .",
    "the length of this molecule obtained by x - ray diffraction is tabulated as @xmath66  nm .",
    "the liquid has a purety better than @xmath62 .",
    "the viscosity of the liquid is given as @xmath67  mpl in the handbook at @xmath68 .",
    "the experiments are carried out at ambient temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath69c .",
    "the apparatus is placed in a plexiglass box which reduces sound vibrations , and contains some desiccant ( silicagel ) to dry the atmosphere and prevent the dissolution of water in dodecane .",
    "the experiment starts with the surfaces being separated by a distance of @xmath70  nm .",
    "a voltage increasing linearly in time is applied to one of the piezoelectric actuator , so that the sphere moves toward the plane at constant speed . in the same time",
    ", we impose a small oscillation of the sphere @xmath71 , with @xmath72  nm at a frequency @xmath73  hz . in the lubrication approximation , the viscous force between the two surfaces gives the well - known expression  ( georges ( 1993 ) ) : @xmath74 in our experiments , the viscous force on @xmath4 is  : @xmath75 we can read the displacement @xmath76 induced on the cantilever @xmath4 by the viscous flow between the sphere and the plane . since @xmath77  hz , the value of the excitation frequency , is above the resonant frequency of the cantilever @xmath4 , the real viscous force @xmath78 is obtained by multiplying @xmath79 by the mechanical transfert function of the mass - cantilever system .",
    "first of all , we find that the measured force is out of phase the displacement excitation ( @xmath80 ) which means that a purely dissipative force is measured . on figure [ dodecane ] ,",
    "the inverse of the damping coefficient @xmath81 is plotted as a function of the distance @xmath12 between the surfaces .",
    "this curve clearly shows the a good agreement of the lubrication theory for all the distances greater than @xmath82  nm which corresponds to 5 molecular length of dodecane .",
    "the origin @xmath83 is obtained by the linear extrapolation of the best linear fit of the experimental data and the origin of the axis @xmath84 .",
    "the slope of this curve combined with equation ( [ equ : damp_eq2 ] ) , gives the viscosity of dodecane .",
    "we find @xmath85  pl which can be compared to the tabulated value ( see handbook ) @xmath86  pl at @xmath69c .",
    "this result agrees well those of tonck _ et al . _",
    "( 1989 ) on the same liquid .",
    "we have presented a new capacitive sensor for surface forces measurements allowing both static and dynamic measurements between non transparent surfaces .",
    "this sensor does not not need any lock - in amplifier for the statics measurements and has a very low cost . in the static regime",
    ", this sensor has a sensitivity of @xmath9  nm with an integration time of @xmath13  s. in the dynamic regime , combined with a frequency to voltage converter , this sensor has a sensitivity better than @xmath13  pm.hz@xmath59 .",
    "we have used this sensor for surface force measurements between pyrex surfaces separated by a small meniscus of dodecane .",
    "away from the contact between the surfaces , we have confirmed previous results showing that the bulk viscosity of the liquid is not affected by the confinement . at a distance between the surfaces",
