    "at high energies in the framework of the perturbative quantum chromodynamics strong interactions are mediated by the exchenge of hard pomerons , which are non - local entities propagating according to the bfkl equation and splitting into two or merging from two to one with the known triple pomeron vertex .",
    "neglecting pomeron loops and choosing the projectile to have a short range and the target to be a heavy nucleus one comes to the well - known balitski - kovchegov ( bk ) equation , which sums pomeron fan diagrams going from the projectile towards the target  @xcite . this equation with certain degrees of sophistication , including higher orders and running coupling ,",
    "is widely used in applications with very positive results .",
    "however from the start it is clear that summing all fans this equation neglects the obvious limitation that the nucleus in fact is finite , so that the number of splittings in fans is restricted .",
    "it is not clear how this restriction affects the resulting amplitude .",
    "this fact can not be too small .",
    "for instance , taking instead of a heavy nucleus a light one , say the deuteron , one sees that the results become drastically different , since then the amplitude essentially reduces to the exchange of two pomerons ang grows correspondingly at high energies .",
    "this problem is difficult to study in the framework of the fully - fledged qcd pomeron theory .",
    "however very long ago a description of the ha interaction by means of the sum of fan diagrams was proposed by a.schwimmer in the reggeon field theory with a local supercritical pomeron  @xcite .",
    "there one easily obtains a solution of the equation , which sums all fans and is basically similar to the bk equation . taking into account that the momenta transferred to the nucleus",
    "are small one gets for the ha amplitude at given rapidity @xmath0 and fixed impact parameter @xmath1 ( b)=. [ schw ] here @xmath2 is the pomeron intercept minus unity , assumed to be positive , @xmath3 is the nuclear profile function normalized to unity , @xmath4 is the triple pomeron coupling with the opposite sign and @xmath5 is the pomeron - nucleon coupling .",
    "this old formula possesses some nice features .",
    "in particular the schwimmer amplitude goes to a constant value at very high energies , implying that at such energies the nucleus behaves like a ( grey ) disk , which more or less agrees with the later more sophisticated treatments",
    ". we shall be interested in not so much of its physical applications but rather as a tool to study our problem : how the limitations on the number of splitting coming from the actual finiteness of @xmath6 change the result .",
    "having the explicit solution ( [ schw ] ) this is quite trivial to see .",
    "let z=(e^y-1 ) , so that the schwimmer amplitude is just ( b)=. [ schw1 ] for a finite nucleus with atomic number @xmath6 obviously we get just @xmath6 first terms of the expansion of ( [ schw1 ] ) in powers of @xmath7 _ a(b)=gat(b)e^y_n=0^a(-z)^n = gat(b)e^y .",
    "[ schwf ] here and in the following we denote with subindex @xmath6 the amplitudes which refer to finite nuclei of atomic number @xmath6 , leaving the amplitude for infinite nucleus without any subindex .",
    "one immediately sees that if @xmath8 then the series in ( [ schwf ] ) is convergent and the error in using the infinite nuclei instead of the finite ( and phyiscal ) is exponentially small . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath9 the series ( [ schwf ] ) is divergent and the schwimmer formula for infinite nucleus has nothing in common with the real amplitude for finite nucleus .",
    "condition of validity of the fan diagram amplitude @xmath8 translates into the restriction on the highest rapidity where this amplitude has the physical meaning e^y<1 + .",
    "[ cond ] if the internucleon distance in the nucleus is @xmath10 then crudely estimating we have @xmath11 and ( [ cond ] ) gives y<(1+a^-1/3 ) .",
    "[ cond1 ] with fixed @xmath12 independent of @xmath6 and large @xmath13 this degenerates into y < a^-1/3<<1 , which has little physical meaning .",
    "the only possibility to have some sense for the schwmimmer amplitude for realistic nuclei is to choose @xmath12 extremely small to compensate factor @xmath14 in ( [ cond1 ] ) . otherwise this formula is just an analytic continuation of the physical amplitude having no relation to reality .",
    "this problem is of course not a new one and is not restricted to only fan diagrams . in a simpler case of the scattering of a hadron on a nuclear target in the glauber approximation one gets the amplitude ia_a(b)=(1+ia(y)t(b))^a-1 , [ glau ] where @xmath15 is the forward proton - proton scattering amplitude . in the limit @xmath16 and @xmath17 one",
    "gets the standard expression ( b)=1-e^iat(b)a(y ) , which is quite atttractive , since it is explicitly unitary .",
    "however expression ( [ glau ] ) is unitary only while @xmath18 .",
    "this is always so when the proton - proton scattering amplituide is unitary itself .",
    "however if one takes for @xmath19 the amplitude corresponding to the exchange of a supercritical pomeron and so rising with @xmath0 as @xmath20 then the expression for finite nuclei looses sense for high enough @xmath0 . the limiting expression for infinite nuclei preserves its unitary character but its relation to the physical amplitude becomes lost .    observing these examples",
    "we may conclude that in both cases , fans and glauber , the origin of the difficulty lies in the wrong behaviour of the elementary proton - proton scattering amplitude ( pomeron propagator ) growing exponentially with rapidity and violating unitarity .",
    "this wrong behaviour is possibly cured by inclusion of contributions from pomeron loops .",
    "we can not be sure that this happens in the reggeon field theory , which lies at the basis of the schwimmer formula ( [ schw ] ) .",
    "still less is known about the behaviour of the propagator of the non - local pomeron in the perturbative qcd .",
    "however there is a simple model where calculation of all loop contributions is possible .",
    "this is a reggeon `` toy model '' in the zero - dimensional transverse space .",
    "having rapidity as the only variable it actually reduces to a sort of quantum mechanics with a non - hermithean interaction .",
    "this theory has been extensively studied in the past  @xcite-  @xcite and in the limit @xmath21 it was shown analytically that inclusion of loops makes the pomeron propagator vanish in the high - energy limit .",
    "more recently it was considered in @xcite and in  @xcite a calculational technique was elaborated which allowed to numerically sum all contributioins for arbitrary values of parameters . in this paper",
    "we apply this technique to study the behaviour of the ha amplitude in the model for finite nuclei and establish the relation between the sum of fan diagrams and the full amplitude in this case .",
    "note that the fan amplitude in the toy model is identical to the more physical schwimmer amplitude ( [ schw ] ) .",
    "the simplification of neglecting the transverse space is felt only in the loop diagrams , which in the toy model are certainly different from the ones in the reggeon field theory with transverse dimensions .",
    "still we expect that lessons known in the study of the toy model will be instructive to consider the situation in more physical theories including the perturbative qcd .",
    "in this section we briefly recapitulate the definition and propreties of the toy model indispensable for our study , referring the reader either to old papers  @xcite-  @xcite or to the comparatively recent paper  @xcite .",
    "the toy model is the regge - gribov theory of a pomeron field @xmath22 depending only on rapidity @xmath0 ( zero - dimensional transverse space ) , which may be defined by the functional integral z = dde^-s ,  s = dy l , [ funint ] where = ( _ y-_y)-+i(+ ) . [ lagrangian ] here @xmath2 is the pomeron intercept ( @xmath23 ) . for the supercritical pomeron @xmath24 .",
    "triple pomeron coupling constant @xmath12 is also positive .",
    "the functional integral ( [ funint ] ) converges for @xmath25 ( subcritical pomeron ) .",
    "but in the physically interestng case when @xmath24 the integral does not exist . then in fact it only serves to introduce perturbative diagrams in the regge - gribov approach .",
    "one can pass to an alternative , hamiltonian formalism , which reproduces the perturbative diagrams but is free from the restriction @xmath25 .",
    "it is based on a quasi - schroedinger equation in rapidity for the wave function @xmath26 = -h(y ) with the hamiltonian @xmath27 which can be chosen to be real h = u v - u(u+v)v [ huv ] and is a function of two operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which are anti - hermithean to each other u^=-v ,  v^=-u and satisfy the commutation relation = -1 .",
    "[ commrel ] operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 have the meaning of creation and annihilation operators of the pomeron respectively .",
    "the vacuum state @xmath30 , normalized to unity , satisfies @xmath31 .",
    "all other states are built from @xmath30 by application of some number of operators @xmath28 .",
    "the transition amplitude from the initial state @xmath32 at rapidity @xmath33 to the final state @xmath34 at rapidity @xmath0 is given by ia_fi=_f|_i(y ) ,  _ i(y)=e^-hy_i .",
    "[ mel ] the amplitude @xmath35 is imaginary positive so that the matrix element on the right - hand side of ( [ mel ] ) is negative .",
    "some care should be taken to express the initial and final scattering states @xmath36 and @xmath37 via creation operators .",
    "we take them also to be real . assuming that the initial state representing a heavy nucleus with @xmath38 has an eikonal structure we take _ i(u)=(1-e^-g_iu)_0 , [ ini ] where @xmath39 is a positive coupling constant with the initial nucleus .",
    "it is important that the final state should be taken not as an immediate copy of ( [ ini ] ) ( with a maybe different coupling constant ) but with an additional change @xmath40 _ f(u)=(1-e^+g_fu)_0 .",
    "[ fin ] as we shall see this immediately follows from the form of the amplitude at @xmath33 .",
    "so for the scattering of two nuclei we get the amplitude in terms of purely real quantities i a= ( 1-e^g_fu)_0|e^-hy|(1-e^-g_iu)_0= ( 1-e^-g_fv)e^-hy(1-e^-g_iu ) . in the last formula the vacuum matrix element is implied . since @xmath41 the term independent of @xmath39 and @xmath42 vanishes , so that we can also write ia_fi= -e^-g_fve^-hy(1-e^-g_iu)= -_0|e^-g_fvf_i(y , u)_0 , [ ampli1 ] where @xmath43 is the operator which creates the evolved initial state .",
    "it satisfies the equation = -h(u , v)f_i(y , u ) [ evol ] with the initial condition f_i(0,u)=1-e^-g_iu .",
    "[ initf ] the commutation relation ( [ commrel ] ) allows to represent v=- [ vrepr ] and then ( [ ampli1 ] ) implies that to find the amplitude one has to substitute @xmath28 by @xmath42 in @xmath43 ia_fi =- f_i(y , g_f ) .    at @xmath33",
    "this gives the initial amplitude = i(1-e^-g_fg_i ) in clear correspondence with the nucleus - nucleus amplitude in the so - called optical approximation .",
    "should we take the final state without reversing the sign of @xmath28 we would get the sign plus in the exponent in obvious contradiction with the optical amplitude .    taking the complex conjugate of ( [ ampli1 ] ) we find -ia^*_fi= ( 1-e^g_iv)e^-h^y(1-e^g_fu)=ia_if(-,g_i(f)-g_f(i ) )",
    ". having in mind that the amplitude is pure imaginary , we see that interchanging the target and projectile leads to the overall change of sign @xmath40 .",
    "however this will not change the amplitude . indeed after evolution we shall get function @xmath44 . but the change @xmath40 in the final state requires that now we have to substitute @xmath28 by @xmath45 so that the result will be the same @xmath46 as for the direct transition .",
    "so the interchange of the target and projectile does not change the amplitude .",
    "calculation of the scattering amplitude reduces to the solution of the differential equation in two variables , @xmath0 and @xmath28 = ( u -u^2 + u)f_i(y , u ) , [ evol1 ] which determines evolution in @xmath0 of function @xmath47 initally given at @xmath33 : @xmath48 . note that apart from the chosen @xmath6 the amplitude depends on @xmath0 and two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath12 . from the form of the eq .",
    "( [ evol1 ] ) it folows that this last three variables are combined in two : the scaled rapidity @xmath49 and ratio @xmath50 .",
    "so one can explore the whole domain of rapidities @xmath0 and values of @xmath2 and @xmath12 by limiting @xmath51 and changing values of @xmath52 appropriately .",
    "equation ( [ evol1 ] ) can be solved anaytically only in the case when one drops the term with the second derivative , which describes fusing of pomerons .",
    "the remaining equation with only the first derivatives describes propagating pomerons and their consecutive splittings , that is fan diagrams .",
    "its solution can be easily obtained to be  @xcite @xmath53 for the fan amplitude one chooses the initial state to be a single pomeron @xmath54 to find f^fan(y , u)=. [ fan ] the amplitude itself is obtained from ( [ fan ] ) by putting @xmath55 and multiplcation by @xmath56 ( it is essentially identical with the schwimmer amplitude ( [ schw ] ) )    with the second derivative term included , solution of eq .",
    "( [ evol1 ] ) gives the complete amplitude with all tree diagrams and loop diagrams taken into account .",
    "note that for nucleus - nucleus scattering the set of tree diagrams is much wider than the the set of fan diagrams .",
    "unfortunately eq .",
    "( [ evol1 ] ) in this case can not be solved analytically ( note , however some important estimates at very small @xmath12 in older papers  @xcite-  @xcite ) .",
    "so one is compelled to recur to numerical methods for the solution of eq .",
    "( [ evol1 ] ) . in",
    "@xcite it was found that the most straightforward approach of evolving the initial fuction in rapidity by the runge = kutta method proved to be quite feasible , provided the step in @xmath0 is small enough and correlated wth the step in @xmath28 . in our present calculation we find good convergence with @xmath57 , @xmath58 and the interval in @xmath28 taken as @xmath59 .",
    "further diminishing of @xmath60 or @xmath61 or raising the maxinum value of @xmath28 have been found to produce no change whatsoever .",
    "calculations in  @xcite pursued a somewhat restricted goal to only illustrate the feasibility of the numerical approach and see the limiting behaviour of the propagator and ha amplitude in the limit of very high rapidities .",
    "here we study the @xmath6 dependence of the ha amplitude having in mind finite nuclei of different atomic numbers and comparison with the results for infinite nuclei . in the standard eikonal picture the effective coupling to the nucleus grows as @xmath62 , which comes from the product @xmath63 .",
    "accordingly we take for the nucleus @xmath64 and for the nucleon @xmath65 for simplicity .",
    "the ha amplitude for the infinite nucleus is then found as explained earlier . at @xmath33",
    "we start from @xmath66 , evolve this function according to eq .",
    "( [ evol1 ] ) and take the final function @xmath47 at @xmath55 .",
    "however the main purpose of our calculations is to find what will happen when we consider realisitic nuclei with finite atomic numbers @xmath6 . to pass to finite nuclei we change the eikonal amplitude for the infinite nucleus to its standard glauber form for the finite nucleus with atomic number @xmath6 : 1-e^-g_fu1-(1-u)^a .",

    "of course these features can be immediately read from eq .",

    "for instance for @xmath74 at @xmath82 the ha amplitudes for @xmath838 , 27 , 64 and 125 are found to be 1.23 , 1.28 , 1.31 and 1.34 with the total difference less than 10% .",
    "this means that the structure of the ha amplitude with loops taken into account is due mostly to formation of loops during evolution so that the amplitude quickly forgets the initial state . in the exeptional case @xmath80 and",

    "this is in spite of the fact that with a finite nucleus infinite fans seem to have nothing to do with the physical amplitude .",
    "so the analytic continuation involved in extending the validity of the finite fans to infinite ones seems to effectively take into account contributions from loops at small enough @xmath12 .",
    "this surprizing result might have some bearing on the validity of the fan amplitude in general and in the pertubative qcd ( bk eqiation ) in particular .",
    "\\4 ) with the growth of @xmath12 also infinite fans cease to describe the amplitude , which can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] . with @xmath76 at @xmath82",
    "they overestimate the amplitude by 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "for realisitic nuclei with finite atomic numbers @xmath6 the standard infinite series of fan diagrams in the regge theory for ha amplitude converts into a finite sum . with the elementary hadron cross - section rising at large energies",
    "this finite sum preserves physical meaning only up to a certain maximal energy , which in fact is not very large and goes down with the rise of @xmath6 .",
    "inclusion of loop diagrams may cure this situation . to study this problem we considered the toy regge model existing in zero transverse dimensions where",
    "the loops can be taken into account by numerical methods .",
    "our results first show that for finite nuclei the model with contribution from loops included gives reasonable results up to very high energies .",
    "second we discover that the found ha amplitude is practically identical with the one which corresponds to the infinite nucleus .",
    "in fact at large energies the found amplitude is weakly dependent on the initial amplitude at zero energies , so that it is formed completely from loop contributions .",
    "finally we found that at small enough triple pomeron coupling @xmath84 the infinite series of fan diagrams gives a good description of the amplitude for finite nuclei in spite of the fact that in reality the series should be cut and the cut series has no physical sense at large energies .",
    "the analytic continuation in parameters involved in making the cut series to converge seems to somehow take the loop contribution into account .",
