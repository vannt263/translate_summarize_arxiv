    "binary stars are numerous ( from 50 to even 90 per cent in the local group ) .",
    "doubled lined eclipsing binaries provide the only method by which fundamental stellar parameters ( such as mass , radius , luminosity , etc . ) can be independently estimated without having to resolve spatially the binary or rely on astrophysical assumptions .",
    "unfortunately , only a small fraction of all binaries eclipse , and spectroscopy , with sufficient resolution , can only be performed for bright stars .",
    "the intersection of these two groups leaves only several hundred stars , an amount that is not growing significantly .",
    "meanwhile recent major advances in ccd detectors and the implementation of image - difference analysis techniques enables simultaneous photometric measurements of tens of thousands of stars in a single exposure , leading to a dramatic growth in the number of stars with high - quality , multi - epoch , photometric data .",
    "there are many millions of light curves available from a variety of surveys , such as the ground based asas @xcite , macho @xcite , ogle @xcite , eros @xcite , tres @xcite , hat @xcite and the space born kepler @xcite and corot @xcite projects . thus eclipsing binaries represent the most numerous type type of binaries with known orbital period , because it can be easily determined from the not very long photometric observational sets .",
    "however , the number of fully characterized eclipsing binaries has not grown significantly , as there has not been a corresponding growth in the quantity of spectroscopic data . therefore it would be advisable to develop a procedure for estimation of the fundamental parameters values for eclipsing variables with unknown spectroscopic elements . obviously , an assessment of eclipsing binary evolutionary status should be performed prior to the start of the fundamental parameters estimation , as the set of rules for parametrization varies from one evolutionary status to another .",
    "a procedure for determination of the evolutionary class from the rest of the observational data was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "the procedure is based on a restricted number of systems with known classes contained in the old @xcite catalogue which , as our analysis has shown @xcite , is not accurate enough .",
    "useful ideas for classification of eclipsing binaries can also be found in a statistical study made by @xcite , however , they mostly dealt with only three classes of systems ( detached , semi - detached and contact ) .",
    "in this paper we present a novel procedure , which utilizes the most comprehensive set of rules for the classification of eclipsing binaries , while requiring only light curve parameters and an estimate of the binary s spectral type or color index .",
    "this procedure can be used to quickly characterize large numbers of eclipsing binaries ( which can be advisable e.g. , for statistical investigations ) , and allows the user to categorize them , even if the set of the mentioned parameters is incomplete .",

    "the main goal of our work is to develop a fast and effective procedure for determination of the evolutionary status of eclipsing binaries . since 2004 @xcite we have collected information on light - curve parameters and other observational parameters of these variables , on one hand , and recent published information about evolutionary status of eclipsing binaries , on the other hand . the second version of the catalogue of eclipsing variables ( cev)malkov / cev/ ]  @xcite contains about 7200 eclipsing binaries , and the evolutionary status is available for about 1300 of them .",
    "the collected data allows us to make a preliminary statistical analysis and find relations between the different parameters for various evolutionary classes of eclipsing binaries .",
    "such an analysis is presented in this section .",
    "detailed description of the evolutionary classes used in the current study can be found in  @xcite , while meaning of the light - curve parameter designations , thought generally accepted , is given in  @xcite .",

    "our procedure should be effective and stable with respect to the absence of some observational parameter values .",
    "in particular , a lack of parameters leads to a condition when a system resides in an area of the parameter space , covered by two or more evolutionary classes .",
    "one example is described in appendix  [ app : application ] .",
    "another case is illustrated in two left panels of fig .",
    "[ shvsdr ] where both dr and sh classes can be assigned to binaries without known spectral types .    to solve this problem",
    "we calculate a membership probability ( hereafter mp ) for each class that can be assigned to the binary based on data of table  [ parameters ] by the classification procedure .",
    "the probability that a given system belongs to a class @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) is the ratio of binaries with available @xmath79-classification ( @xmath81 ) to the total number of binaries @xmath82 with the available classification in the @xmath83 radius around the examined system in the parameter space @xmath84 : @xmath85 we estimate @xmath86 to    * @xmath87 mag for depth of minima .",
    "it is a typical photometric error for photographic photometry , and at least half of magnitudes presented in cev are photographic ones .",
    "other ( mostly photoelectric ) catalogued photometric data have a better accuracy ; * about 25 per cent of period value itself .",
    "these @xmath86 leads to interval [ 0.25p;1.75p ] .",
    "although individual periods can in some cases be determined with very high precision , the choice of our @xmath86 is driven by the large range of periods in our training set data . our testing has shown that adopting such a large @xmath86 does not degrade the performance of our results ; * five spectral subclasses , which is an approximate accuracy of spectral type , estimated from stellar color - index .",
    "this approach is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ probability ] , which represents a 2d - box ( a@xmath0a@xmath1 ) of the multi - dimensional space , where number of dimensions is the number of observational parameters used for the classification .",
    "the filled star is tx  nor , the system of unknown evolutionary status , while binaries with available classification are represented by empty circles ( semidetached algols , sa ) , filled circle ( hot semidetached systems , sh ) , filled square ( detached ms systems , dm ) and empty square ( detached system with subgiants , dr ) .",
    "thus the membership probability for tx  nor to be an algol - like system equals to : @xmath88 @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 can be calculated similarly .",
    "we consider the binary to be categorized successfully if the membership probability for one of the evolutionary classes exceeds 0.5 .",
    "the described procedure is simple , quick and can be implemented in an automated program analysing published catalogues / lists of eclipsing binaries .",
    "however we should draw user s attention to the following features .",
    "the majority of the catalogued systems with available classification ( i.e. out training set ) have an incomplete parameter set .",
    "for example , spectral classification of both components is available only for 28 per cent of categorized cev binaries . as a result ,",
    "the smaller the parameter set that is available , the larger the number of systems that are located within the given parameter space , and vice versa .",
    "if there are no systems in the @xmath83 vicinity the mp value ca nt be calculated because @xmath82 in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) equals to zero . in such cases",
    "we increase the size of the parameter space by one or more sigmas while these number becomes greater than 1 .",
    "however , the minimum size of @xmath92 was sufficient to calculate mp for about 90 per cent of the investigated systems , and the maximum size of @xmath93 was applied to only two binaries .",
    "the calculated mp values depends on available parameter set ( i.e. the number of dimensions of the examined parameter space ) thus we test our procedure on the systems with different parameter sets separately .",
    "this means that if a catalogued system has less or more parameters than examined unclassified binary it is nt included to the parameter space .",
    "another feature of the procedure is that mp value directly depends on the number of different evolutionary class representatives in the vicinity of an examined system .",
    "for example , an area in the parameter space , occupied by sh systems , is populated also by dm systems ( see table  [ parameters ] ) . however , the former evolutionary class is much poorer represented among observed systems due to the relatively small number of ( high mass ) objects and a rather rapid stage of stellar evolution .",
    "consequently , dm systems are more numerous in the parameter space , and an examined system will be categorized as a dm system with higher probability .",
    "we believe it is a correct solution , as the examined system will more likely belong to an evolutionary class of frequent occurrence .        to estimate the efficiency of the procedure we have applied it to cev binaries with already available classification .",
