    "unlike the vast majority of phase transitions , bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) is not driven by inter - particle interactions but can theoretically occur in an ideal ( non - interacting ) gas , purely as a consequence of quantum statistics . however , in reality , interactions are needed for a bose gas to remain close to thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is thus interesting to discuss if something close to ideal gas bec can be observed in a real system and what happens in the vicinity of the bec transition in the presence of inter - particle interactions .",
    "these simple questions have not been easy to answer , either theoretically or experimentally .",
    "the theoretical foundations for studying the effect of interactions on bose condensed systems were laid over half a century ago by bogoliubov @xcite , penrose and onsager @xcite , and belieav @xcite , among others .",
    "these works initially focused on zero - temperature properties and were extended to nonzero temperature in the pioneering papers of lee , huang and yang @xcite . at that time",
    "the main experimental system was liquid he-4 in which the inter - particle interactions are strong , making connections with theory difficult .",
    "the realisation in 1995 of bec in weakly interacting ultracold atomic gases @xcite thus opened up the possibility to experimentally revisit some of these long - discussed questions .",
    "this was further aided by , among other advances , the use of feshbach resonances to tune the interaction strength in atomic gases @xcite .",
    "thus , in the last 20 years the study of ultracold bose gases has been very successful .",
    "however , the fact that , until recently , ultracold atoms were confined using harmonic potentials has hindered the study of the bec transition itself .",
    "this is due to the resulting inhomogeneous density distribution which often masks the most interesting interaction effects and also makes direct comparison with theory challenging .    in this chapter",
    "we review some recent experimental investigations using atomic bose gases that have sought to study the role of interactions on bec",
    ". we will mainly focus on measurements in harmonic traps , paying particular attention to how these results relate to the physics in a homogeneous system .",
    "we also discuss some of the first measurements on a homogeneous atomic bose gas and the possibilities that such measurements present in the future .",
    "note that we will focus here on three dimensional systems close to the bec transition temperature .",
    "some parts of the present chapter were also discussed in a previous chapter written by the author @xcite .",
    "the outline of the chapter is as follows . in section 2",
    "we recap some theoretical background related to homogenous bose gases in the presence of repulsive contact interactions and outline how these results may be applied to a harmonically trapped system using the local density approximation ( lda ) . then in sections 3 , 4 and 5 we focus on the experimental investigations of three aspects of the bec transition in the presence of interactions : ( i ) the statistical mechanism of the bec transition , ( ii ) the transition temperature , and ( iii ) the critical behaviour near the transition .",
    "in this section we provide the key theoretical points necessary to understand and interpret the experimental results presented in the rest of the chapter .",
    "the treatment we give here is by necessity brief and we refer the interested reader to more comprehensive reviews @xcite .",
    "we first outline the expected behaviour for an ideal homogeneous gas before going on to consider the effect of weak interactions on such a gas .",
    "finally , we consider how these homogeneous results may be applied to a harmonically trapped gas .",

    "( b ) the density as a function of @xmath8 close to the critical density .",
    "( c ) the correlation length diverges as @xmath9 as we approach the transition from above with @xmath10 ; below @xmath11 the correlation length remains infinite . ]    in a gas of bosons of mass @xmath12 in equilibrium at temperature @xmath13 the occupation of momentum state @xmath14 is given by the bose distribution function , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the chemical potential .",
    "the total particle number @xmath17 can be found by summing over all possible momentum states , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of states with a given @xmath20 .",
    "the requirement for all terms in the sum to be real positive numbers constrains @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the momentum of the ground state .",
    "as @xmath16 approaches @xmath23 from below ( which is achieved by adding particles ) the ground state occupation can become arbitrarily large ( see eq .",
    "( [ smith : eq : bosep ] ) ) whereas the sum of the remainder of the states ( the excited states ) tends to a finite number .",
    "this helps us to understand the mechanism for bose - einstein condensation , namely the statistical saturation of excited states .",
    "saturation can be graphically represented as shown in fig .",
    "[ smith : fig : idealgas](a ) by plotting both the ground state population and excited state population versus the total atom number for a fixed temperature .",
    "as particles are added to the system they initially populate excited states until a critical atom number is reached above which the excited state population is saturated and any additional particles must enter the ground state .    in the thermodynamic limit , in which both the volume of the system and total atom number become large , we may use the semiclassical approximation .",
    "that is , we replace the sum over excited states by an integral in order to calculate the critical atom number ( or density ) .",
    "the excited state density @xmath24 , which we also call the thermal density , is given by : @xmath25 where @xmath26^{1/2}$ ] is the thermal wavelength and @xmath27 is a polylogarithm function . note that in this limit @xmath28 and so now @xmath29 .",
    "we can re - express this result in terms of the phase space density @xmath30 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 . the maximum value that @xmath33 can take",
    "is reached when @xmath34 and occurs when the total density reaches a critical value @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 is the riemann function ) . here",
    "the superscript @xmath37 refers to the fact this is an ideal gas result .",
    "we can also invert this result to give the bec transition temperature for a fixed density : @xmath38    in this large @xmath17 limit the transition to a bec is a well defined second - order phase transition and is thus characterised by a set of critical exponents which describe how various quantities diverge when approaching the transition .",
    "here we focus on three exponents as summarised in fig .",
    "[ smith : fig : idealgas ] .",
    "\\(i ) the growth of the condensate density @xmath0 below the transition temperature is described by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the _ reduced temperature _ given by @xmath41 .",
    "\\(ii ) above @xmath11 the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath8 can be found by expanding eq .",
    "( [ smith : eq : psd ] ) for small @xmath8 ; up to first - order this expansion ( at constant volume ) gives @xmath42 and thus @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the critical chemical potential ( for an ideal gas @xmath45 ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath16 is particularly important when discussing inhomogeneous systems .",
    "\\(iii ) the correlation length @xmath46 quantifies the range over which fluctuations in the gas are correlated and its divergence , described by the critical exponent @xmath47 , is defined by @xmath48 .",
    "the correlation length can defined by the first - order two - point correlation function , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the bose field .",
    "this correlation function is formally related to the fourier transform of the momentum distribution .",
    "far from the bec transition ( @xmath51 ) the bose momentum distribution ( eq .  ( [ smith : eq : bosep ] ) ) is approximately gaussian and thus @xmath52 is short ranged and given by a gaussian of width @xmath53 .",
    "as we approach the transition long - range correlations begin to develop and for @xmath54 we can approximate the correlation function as @xcite , @xmath55 for an ideal gas @xmath56 ; combining this result with the expansion from ( ii ) and the fact that for small @xmath40 we can write @xmath57 gives @xmath58 .",
    "thus , for an ideal gas bec transition ( at constant volume ) @xmath10 .      ; the critical region ( here defined by @xmath59 ) is shown in gray ; the solid lines in ( a ) and ( b ) are based on classical field monte - carlo results @xcite within the critical region and an extrapolation onto the popov approximation outside it .",
    "( a ) interactions both shift the critical point and also modify the condensed and thermal densities for @xmath60 .",
    "( b ) the dependence of @xmath61 on @xmath62 in the presence of interactions .",
    "mf theory ( dashed line ) predicts @xmath63 and an erroneous first - order transition whereas beyond - mf theory ( solid line ) predicts a second order transition with an exponent between the ideal and mf values .",
    "( c ) interactions change the correlation length critical exponent from @xmath10 to @xmath64 . ]    for a dilute atomic gas the effective low - energy interaction between two atoms at @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be approximated as a contact interaction @xmath67 with @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the @xmath70-wave scattering length .",
    "note that the dimensionless parameter which usually defines the relative strength of interactions , @xmath71 , is typically @xmath72 for ultracold atomic gases .",
    "a simple theoretical framework in which to understand the effects of contact interactions on a bose gas is the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation @xcite . in this mean - field ( mf )",
    "model one treats the thermal atoms as a  non - interacting \" gas of density @xmath24 that experiences a mf interaction potential @xmath73 where @xmath0 is the condensate density .",
    "thus , @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ smith : eq : bosep ] ) is replaced by @xmath75 .",
    "meanwhile the condensed atoms feel an interaction potential @xmath76 where the factor of two difference in the condensate self - interaction comes about due to the lack of the exchange interaction term for particles in the same state .",
    "this hf approach does not take into account the modification of the excitation spectrum due to the presence of the condensate , which is included in more elaborate mf theories such as those of bogoliubov @xcite and popov @xcite .",
    "however , it is often sufficient to give the correct leading order mf results . in a homogeneous system , above @xmath11 , the mf interaction potential leads to a uniform energy offset which is simply compensated for by a shift in the chemical potential and thus makes no physical difference to the system .",
    "the effects of interactions on a homogeneous system at a mf - level only result from the factor of two difference in the condensate self - interaction and therefore only arise when a condensate is present ( or about to appear ) .",
    "all these mf theories are expected to break down as we approach @xmath11 and should only provide a good description outside the critical region ( @xmath77 ) . within the critical region",
    "we must revert to beyond mean - field descriptions .",
    "figure [ smith : fig : interactinggas ] summarises the effect of interactions on bose - einstein condensation . a comparison of figures [ smith : fig : interactinggas ] and [ smith : fig : idealgas ] allows us to highlight several notable differences :    1 .",
    "the gas is no longer saturated after passing through the transition but rather the excited state density decreases as we continue to increase @xmath1 above @xmath4 .",
    "this can be understood at a mean - field level , and is due to the factor of two reduction in the condensate self - interaction which means that an atom can lower its interaction energy by an amount @xmath78 by entering the condensate .",
    "2 .   condensation occurs at a phase space density below the ideal gas critical value of 2.612 .",
    "qualitatively this can be understood to be due to the same effect as in point 1 - that interactions favour the occupation of the condensed state .",
    "however mf - theory predicts an erroneous first - order transition and can not predict the shift quantitatively .",
    "theoretically calculating the shift proved notoriously difficult and took several decades for consensus to be reached ( for an overview see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the shift is given by @xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "equivalently , the @xmath11 shift at constant @xmath1 is @xmath81 3 .",
    "the critical exponents of the transition are also modified .",
    "in fact , the addition of interactions results in a change of universality class to that of the so - called 3d xy - model .",
    "the beyond - mf critical exponents expected in this universality class have been calculated to high accuracy @xcite .",
    "most notably the correlation length critical exponent changes from @xmath10 to @xmath64 .",
    "our approach to tackling inhomogeneous potentials is to apply the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the effect of a potential @xmath82 is to change the energy ( e.g. in eq .",
    "( [ smith : eq : densityint ] ) ) from @xmath74 to @xmath83 . within the lda we subsume @xmath82 within the chemical potential such that we have a local chemical potential , @xmath84 and",
    "then assume that the density and momentum distribution of the gas at a point @xmath65 is that of a homogeneous system with chemical potential @xmath85 .",
    "the lda is generally valid if @xmath82 is changing slowly relative to any other relevant lengthscales .",
    "for an ideal thermal gas well above @xmath11 the only relevant lengthscales are the thermal wavelength @xmath86 and the interparticle spacing @xmath87 .",
    "this suggests the lda should be good for a thermal gas as long as @xmath88",
    ". however the soundness of lda becomes less clear as @xmath46 diverges upon approaching the transition .",
    "within lda the critical point is reached when the maximal local @xmath89 reaches the critical phase space density .",
    "however , it usually makes sense to define the critical point in terms of the critical total particle number @xmath90 ( as the local density is harder to measure than the total atom number in the trap ) .    for an ideal bose gas in a harmonic potential , @xmath91",
    ", we can calculate @xmath90 by inserting eq .",
    "( [ smith : eq : mulocal ] ) with this potential into eq .",
    "( [ smith : eq : psd ] ) , setting @xmath34 and integrating over all space to give , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the geometric mean of the trapping frequencies and @xmath94 .",
    "equivalently for a fixed particle number the transition temperature is given by , @xmath95    in a similar fashion to the ideal homogeneous case if we increase the total atom number @xmath17 at constant temperature then for @xmath96 no condensate is present and the thermal atom number @xmath97 .",
    "however for @xmath98 the thermal component is saturated at @xmath99 .",
    "thus for an ideal gas the basic mechanism of saturation of excited states leading to a bec transition remains .",
    "however , the difference between homogeneous and harmonically trapped gases is much more fundamental than a simple change in the expression for @xmath11 might suggest . even for an ideal gas the inhomogeneous density distribution means that as we approach the transition only the central region of the cloud is close to critical density and so the critical behaviour of the gas is quite different . for example the divergence of @xmath46 is constrained by a short lengthscale determined by the trap . in the presence of interactions the differences become even more manifold due to two important factors .",
    "firstly , unlike in a homogeneous system , when we apply lda in a trapped system we are no longer under the constraint of constant @xmath1 but of constant @xmath16 .",
    "this is because we are only free to vary the global chemical potential to fix the total atom number @xmath17 and then locally the chemical potential is set by eq .",
    "( [ smith : eq : mulocal ] ) .",
    "therefore the chemical potential shifts that we could dismiss in the case of a homogeneous system can now have large effects and so a trapped system can display large mean - field effects which were completely absent in the homogeneous case .",
    "in fact , as we will see , these effects often go in the opposite direction to those in a homogenous gas .",
    "secondly , in a trapped system only a small region ( at the trap centre ) is in the critical regime .",
    "this means that the magnitude of any beyond - mf effects are significantly reduced as compared to the homogeneous case .",
    "also , due to our first point above , the beyond - mf effects that we do see are more likely to be related to beyond - mf shifts in @xmath16 rather than the homogeneous system density shifts .",

    "figures adapted from @xcite . ]    in this section , we discuss the concept of the saturation of the excited states as the underlying mechanism driving the bec transition , and how interactions modify this saturated - gas picture . for superfluid @xmath111he , which is conceptually associated with bec , strong interactions preclude direct observation of purely statistical effects expected for an ideal bose gas .",
    "this is generally thought to be in contrast to weakly interacting atomic gases in which close - to - textbook ideal bec is expected .",
    "one might therefore expect that the saturation inequality @xmath112 should be essentially satisfied in these systems .",
    "however , careful examination @xcite revealed that this is far from being the case for a harmonically trapped gas as shown in fig .",

    "[ smith : fig : figure1 ] , which is at first sight surprising , results from the combination of repulsive interactions and harmonic trapping . to first - order",
    "it can be explained in a simple mf picture in which we just consider the interaction of the thermal atoms with the condensate and not with other thermal atoms .",
    "this approximation works because , due to the harmonic trap , as a condensate is formed and grows , the change in the density of the condensed atoms is much larger than the change of the thermal density . within the lda this leads to a spatially varying interaction potential @xmath113 and results in a uniform chemical potential shift everywhere outside the condensate of , @xmath114 where @xmath101 is the condensed atom number and",

    "these experiments thus confirmed the concept of a saturated bose gas , and bose - einstein condensation as a purely statistical phase transition in the non - interacting limit .",
    "they also highlighted the large effects that an inhomogeneous trapping potential can introduce in the presence of mf interactions ( compare figs .  [",
    "smith : fig : interactinggas](a ) and [ smith : fig : figure1 ] ) .",
