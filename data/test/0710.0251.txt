    "the abundance - metallicity relation of low mass extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars ( @xmath4 \\la -3 $ ] ; @xmath5 \\equiv \\log_{10 }   ( n_{\\rm x}/n_{\\rm y } ) - \\log_{10 } ( n_{\\rm x}/n_{\\rm y})_\\odot$ ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the abundances of elements x and y , respectively ) and very metal - poor ( vmp ) stars ( @xmath8 \\la -2 $ ] ) has been clarified by observations of very high quality spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this relation is expected to provide the information of supernovae ( sne ) of population ( pop ) iii ( the first generation ) massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the first stage of galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the emp stars are considered to have suffered the injection of heavy elements from one or a few sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a halo interstellar medium becomes gradually homogeneous with metallicity @xcite .",
    "although recent studies of the star formation in the first stage of gce have been in progress , the characteristics of first generation stars , such as initial mass function , have not been clarified . in order to clarify such characteristics , we should investigate nucleosynthesis in the candidates of the first generation stars as well as the observed variations of the abundance distributions of the emp and vmp stars .",
    "recent observations have indicated that the abundance ratios [ x / fe ] averaged in the metal - poor stars with @xmath4 \\la -2 $ ] are between @xmath9 and 0.5 for most of observed elements @xcite .",
    "their scatter around the average values deduced from the new observation is much smaller than found in earlier studies .",
    "the elemental abundance distribution of the metal - poor stars is not so different from that of the solar - system composition .",
    "therefore , the small scatter is considered to suggest primordial burst of high - mass stars or the very rapid mixing of matter from different bursts of early star formation .    from theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "@xcite compared the pop iii hypernova ( hn ) yields with the abundance pattern of emp stars with the metallicity range @xmath10 < -3.5 $ ] in @xcite .",
    "they adopted the mixing - fallback model for the hne .",
    "the hn yields give good agreement with the observed abundances for c , na , mg , al , si , ca , ni , and zn . they also compared the pop iii sn and hn yields integrated over the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with the abundances of vmp stars in the metallicity range @xmath11 < -2.0 $ ] in @xcite .",
    "they reproduced the observed trends of abundance ratios for c , o , na , mg , al , si , ca , cr , ni , and zn .",
    "the sn and hn yields of n , k , sc , ti , mn , and co are short for explaining the observed yield ratios , although sc and ti may be improved in the high - entropy explosion models .",
    "the yields of mn and co may be reproduced by the modification of electron fraction @xmath12 , of which value is still uncertain in the innermost region of sne and hne .",
    "additional nucleosynthesis processes also remain open for these elements .    during a sn explosion ,",
    "the collapsed core becomes extremely high temperature and high density , and neutrinos are produced through pair creation .",
    "the neutrinos are almost thermalized by neutrino - nucleus scattering at the center .",
    "they pass away through the neutrino sphere with carrying the gravitational binding energy of the core .",
    "the neutrino irradiation lasts for about @xmath13 s. the total number of neutrinos emitted in a sn is very huge , i.e. , about @xmath14 .",
    "the neutrinos interact with nuclei in the surrounding stellar material to produce new species of nuclei .",
    "this is called the @xmath0-process .",
    "the @xmath0-process is expected to be an important production process for some elements in pop iii sn explosions .",
    "the @xmath0-process is important for the synthesis of light elements , li and b @xcite , f ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and some heavy neutron - deficient nuclei such as @xmath15la and @xmath16ta @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-process products are synthesized through the spallations by neutrinos from abundant seed nuclei .",
    "it also produces protons and neutrons and their capture reactions also enhance the abundances of some elements . for pop iii sne ,",
    "the seed nuclei are @xmath17-nuclei abundantly produced in complete and incomplete si burning during the explosions .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-process in pop iii sne will produce additional some odd-@xmath1 elements .",
    "we note that most of the nucleosynthesis calculations including the @xmath0-process have been carried out using spherical explosion models @xcite . although the total neutrino energy should be close to the gravitational binding energy released from the collapsing core , properties of the neutrinos are still uncertain .",
    "the properties strongly depend on explosion mechanism but details of the mechanism have not been clarified . on the other hand ,",
    "aspherical explosions have been investigated recently ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in such a case , aspherical structure of neutrino sphere can be formed and the properties of the neutrinos are also still uncertain . therefore , the dependence of the abundances of pop iii sne and hne on neutrino properties should be investigated .    in this study , we focus on the effect of the @xmath0-process on the production of odd-@xmath1 iron - peak elements , sc , mn , and co , during pop iii sn and hn explosions .",
    "we calculate the sn nucleosynthesis including the @xmath0-process .",
    "then , we investigate the dependence of the abundances of sc , mn , and co in the sn ejecta on the energy of neutrinos , the stellar mass , and the explosion energy .",
    "sc , mn , and co are expected to be at least partly synthesized through the @xmath0-process .",
    "we also indicate whether the abundance ratios of sc , mn , and co to fe reproduce those observed in the emp stars when we take into account the @xmath0-process .    in  2",
    "we explain stellar evolution models and the explosion models of sne and a hn .",
    "we also describe the nucleosynthesis models including the @xmath0-process and the neutrino irradiation models . in ",
    "3 we show the abundance distributions of sc , mn , and co in the ejecta of the sn and hn models . we explain additional production of these elements through the @xmath0-process . in ",
    "4 we explain the effect of the @xmath0-process on the abundance ratios of sc , mn , and co to fe and the dependence on the neutrino irradiation strength .",
    "we also compare our results with the abundance ratios observed in the emp stars . in  5",
    "we discuss other production processes of sc , mn , and co proposed in recent studies and the effect of the @xmath0-process .",
    "finally , we summarize this study in  6 .",
    "we calculate the evolution of population iii stars for initial masses of 15 @xmath2 and 25 @xmath2 from zero - age main - sequence to the onset of the core collapse .",
    "we use a henyey - type stellar evolution code including a nuclear reaction network with about 300 isotopes to calculate detailed nucleosynthesis and energy generation .",
    "the input physics is the same as the models used in @xcite .",
    "sn explosions are calculated using a hydrodynamical code of spherically symmetrical piecewise parabolic method @xcite .",
    "we set the explosion energy of the 15 and 25 @xmath2 sn models to be @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the explosion energy in units of @xmath20 ergs .",
    "we also calculate the explosion of a hn for the 25 @xmath2 star model with @xmath21 .",
    "the location of the mass cut of the sn explosions is determined as follows .",
    "for the 15 @xmath2 star model , we set the location of the mass cut at @xmath22 ( @xmath23 being the mass coordinate of a star ) to obtain the ejected @xmath24ni mass of 0.07 @xmath2 . in the case of 25 @xmath2 sn , we set the mass cut location at @xmath25 , so that large ( co , zn)/fe ratios are obtained .",
    "this location corresponds to the bottom of the layer where electron fraction @xmath12 is close to 0.5 @xcite .",
    "a large amount of @xmath24ni is produced in the region of @xmath26 ( see  3.2 for details ) .",
    "since the location of the mass cut is deep , this model ejects the @xmath24ni mass of 0.36 @xmath2 .",
    "this model corresponds to a sn with the explosion energy of @xmath27 and yielding a large @xmath24ni amount ( @xmath28(@xmath24ni)@xmath29 ) such as sn 2005bf @xcite .",
    "note that the mixing - fallback model is not applied to these cases .    in the case of the 25 @xmath2 hn model",
    ", we apply the mixing - fallback model @xcite .",
    "this model approximates aspherical effects of hn explosions @xcite . during aspherical explosion",
    ", the central core of a star first collapses .",
    "then , jet - like explosion ejects the surrounding stellar materials .",
    "some of the materials in an inner region may fallback to the central core from off - axis direction of the jet .",
    "there are three parameters in the mixing - fallback model ; the initial mass cut @xmath30(ini ) , the outer boundary of the mixing region @xmath31(out ) , and the ejection factor @xmath32 .",
    "the initial mass cut corresponds to the mass of the initially collapsing core .",
    "the outer boundary of the mixing region corresponds to the location where the surrounding materials infall to the core during the explosion .",
    "the ejection fraction is the ejected material fraction in the mixing region .",
    "details of the mixing - fallback model have been described in @xcite .",
    "the values of the mixing - fallback parameters should be related to the explosion features such as asphericity and energy deposition rate @xcite .",
    "however , the explosion mechanism has not been clarified .",
    "therefore , we determine these parameter values similar to case a in @xcite . the location of the initial mass cut is set as @xmath33 , which is the bottom of the @xmath34 layer .",
    "this condition deduces large zn / fe ratio @xcite .",
    "the outer boundary of the mixing region is determined as @xmath35 where the mass fraction of @xmath24ni decreases to @xmath36 .",
    "the ejection factor is determined as @xmath37 in order to yield [ o / fe ] = 0.5 .",
    "the electron fraction in complete and incomplete si burning regions is not modified in this study .",
    "the @xmath24ni mass of each explosion model is listed in table 1 .",
    "a huge amount of neutrinos are emitted during sn explosions . for",
    "spherically symmetrical sn explosions , neutrinos are emitted isotropically from the neutrino sphere and carry the majority of gravitational energy of a proto - neutron star . on the other hand , aspherical sne and jet - like explosion would emit neutrinos anisotropically . in this case neutrino irradiation may be very strong in a specific direction .",
    "since we assume spherically symmetrical sn explosions ,",
    "we assume isotropic neutrino emission .    the strength of the neutrino flux is determined by the total neutrino energy .",
    "the adopted values of the total neutrino energy are @xmath38 ergs , @xmath39 ergs , and @xmath40 ergs .",
    "the first value corresponds to normal neutrino irradiation and is almost equal to the gravitational binding energy of a 1.4 @xmath2 neutron star @xcite .",
    "we assume that the neutrino luminosity decrease exponentially with time .",
    "the decay time of the neutrino luminosity is set to be 3.0 s.    the spectra of the sn neutrinos are assumed to obey fermi distribution with zero chemical potentials .",
    "the temperatures of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 are set to be @xmath45 mev/@xmath46 and 4 mev/@xmath46 , respectively .",
    "this set of the neutrino temperatures is the same as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite provided the sn yields adopting the @xmath41 and @xmath42 temperature of @xmath47 mev and @xmath48 ergs .",
    "therefore , we briefly mention the yields obtained using this parameter set .",
    "detailed nucleosynthesis during the sn explosions is calculated by postprocessing using a code of @xcite to which the @xmath0-process reactions in @xcite were added .",
    "we should note that the evolution of neutrino luminosity and energy spectra of hne may be different from that of sne . the neutrino emission from rapidly accreting disks surrounding black holes during gamma ray bursts and",
    "hne has been investigated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "they showed that @xmath49 and smaller amount of @xmath50 are mainly emitted from the accretion disks with slightly hard energy spectra compared with those from proto - neutron stars .",
    "however , the evolution of neutrino emission during hn explosions is still largely uncertain . on the other hand ,",
    "the main contribution of the @xmath0-process is neutral - current interactions , which do not depend on neutrino flavors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the yields of the @xmath0-process products depend on both neutrino energy spectra and the total neutrino energy . roughly speaking",
    ", a larger total neutrino energy corresponds to harder neutrino energy spectra @xcite .",
    "therefore , we set the total neutrino energy as a parameter",
    ".    the value of total neutrino energy @xmath51 ergs may be too large even in the hn model .",
    "if an element is not produced abundantly through the @xmath0-process with @xmath51 ergs , the @xmath0-process contribution should be very small for the production of the element .",
