    "since the observation and explanation of the gunn - effect in the early 60 s it has been known that traveling field inhomogeneities are generated by negative differential velocity ( ndv).@xcite the properties of these traveling gunn - domains have been studied extensively theoretically and experimentally @xcite leading to several proposals for applications .",
    "the most important application is probably the frequency generator .",
    "although oscillator devices based on the gunn - effect operating in the range of 100  ghz have been reported,@xcite gunn - oscillators have not led to the expected breakthrough in technology .",
    "this is largely due to the difficulties in tuning the oscillation frequency .",
    "furthermore , it is impossible to vary the drift velocity vs field characteristics ( @xmath0 curve ) except by using different bulk materials ( e.g. , gaas , ingaas or inp ) .",
    "these problems may be overcome by using an entirely different class of ndv exhibiting materials formed by semiconductor superlattices . in an applied electric field perpendicular to the two - dimensional layers , several different transport mechanisms such as miniband transport , resonant",
    "tunneling , and real - space transfer from well to barriers ( @xmath1 transport ) give rise to complex @xmath0 curves with several regions of ndv as shown in fig .",
    "[ slwfield ] .",
    "in contrast to the above mentioned materials , the tunability of the barrier and well thickness as well as the control over the barrier height in the superlattice can be used to tailor the drift velocity vs field @xmath0 characteristics . by proper engineering , samples with several ndv regions can be manufactured with control over previously inaccessible features such as the actual shape of the ndv ( cf .",
    "[ slwfield ] ) .",
    "the frequency of the oscillations also depends on the number of moving charges in the superlattice , which may be controlled by varying the doping in the quantum wells .",
    "currently , three different types of superlattice oscillations due to ndv have to be distinguished :    * the most prominent type of oscillations is found , when carriers within the miniband are accelerated beyond the brillouin zone boundary , where their drift velocity becomes negative . in the absence of scattering ,",
    "the electron wave packet then oscillates with the bloch frequency @xmath2 , where @xmath3  and @xmath4  denote the superlattice period and planck s constant , respectively.@xcite these so - called bloch oscillations were predicted for superlattices by esaki and tsu in 1970.@xcite inspired by the prospect of thz frequency generators based on superlattice bloch oscillators , a long series of investigations targeting the miniband regime followed leading to the observation of damped bloch oscillations in experiments with pulsed optical excitation a few years ago.@xcite * a different type of oscillations occurs in the miniband regime , when the scattering times are shorter than the tunneling times . in this case transient charge accumulations traveling through the superlattice",
    "may lead to oscillations in the current .",
    "experiments using pulsed optical excitation of carriers in superlattices with wide minibands showed damped oscillations with frequencies up to 20 ghz.@xcite more recently , reflection gain up to 60  ghz in doped superlattices with miniband widths of up to 80  mev was demonstrated.@xcite * very recently a third type of oscillations has been shown to exist in weakly coupled superlattices in field regions where tunneling into higher subbands takes place.@xcite as a consequence of domain formation , this type of oscillations may also be observed in field regions where the electrons tunnel between the lowest subbands .",
    "while the first two oscillation types have never been observed under constant bias conditions , this new type is shown to operate over a broad frequency range practically independent of the external circuit and without any external triggering .    in this paper",
    "we investigate experimentally and theoretically the third type of oscillations in lightly and moderately doped superlattices ( sl ) .",
    "this type of oscillations may be generally observable in the ndv regime of the @xmath0 characteristics of such superlattices . in a companion paper ,",
    "@xcite we have shown that self - sustained oscillations may exist if the dimensionless doping parameter , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the 3d sl doping , and @xmath7 is the field at the resonance we consider ) lies between two values @xmath8 which can be calculated numerically from the local @xmath0 characteristics ( @xmath9 is the number of sl periods ) . if several tunneling resonances exist ( cf . fig .  [ slwfield](a ) and ( b ) ) the frequency of the oscillations increases with increasing index of the subband involved in the tunneling resonance",
    ". this observation is attributed to the larger drift velocities associated with the resonances involving higher subbands .",
    "furthermore , several new oscillatory modes without the typically well - defined domains are shown to exist .",
    "these oscillatory modes can be tuned in frequency simply by changing the applied voltage .",
    "because the oscillations are observable even at room temperature , we suggest to use superlattice oscillators based on resonant tunneling into higher subbands as a tunable source for high frequencies .",
    "four gaas / alas superlattice structures , grown by molecular beam epitaxy , are discussed in this paper . the samples are hereafter referred to as 9.0/4.0 ( doped and undoped ) , 9.0/1.5 , and 13.3/2.7 , where the first number refers to the gaas well width and the second to the alas barrier thickness in nm ( cf .",

    "clearly visible are two plateau regions with almost constant current between 0.5 and 4  v and 6.5 and 8.5  v. to prove that these plateaus are related to the subband resonances , time - of - flight ( tof ) measurements were performed on an undoped 9.0/4.0 reference sample ( @xmath15-@xmath17-@xmath14 diode).@xcite the peak photocurrent is thereby taken as a measure for the inverse transport time , which at low excitation densities is directly proportional to the drift velocity for homogeneous fields .",

    "the resonances for tunneling from the first into the second ( @xmath20 ) as well as into the third ( @xmath21 ) conduction subband are clearly observed at 6 and 15  v , respectively .",
    "the low - field transmission maximum ( @xmath22 ) , which in the case of a strongly coupled superlattice corresponds to miniband conduction , is not resolved in this sample , because the transport time is too long in this field range to be resolved with this method .",
    "however , it has been shown previously that even weakly coupled superlattices exhibit a negative differential drift velocity in this regime.@xcite in addition to the @xmath23 resonances due to @xmath24-subbands in the gaas wells and the exponential nonresonant background , a pronounced step - like increase of the peak photocurrent is observed at about 10  v , which is assigned to enhanced transport through the lowest @xmath25-level in the alas barriers .",
    "the lowest @xmath25-states of the alas barriers are energetically located in such a way that transport through these @xmath25 states becomes possible at voltages between the @xmath20 and @xmath21 resonances . in the drift velocity vs field characteristics , this @xmath1 resonance leads to a step - like increase of the drift velocity as indicated by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ slwfield](b ) .",
    "the voltages of the observed resonances can be compared to the calculated energy levels listed in table  [ samples ] .",
    "for example , the bias voltages @xmath26 for @xmath27 resonances are calculated using @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the energy of the injecting conduction subband and @xmath30 the energy of the conduction subband , in which the carriers are tunneling into .",
    "@xmath9 refers to the number of periods and @xmath31 to the electron charge . in the case of @xmath1 resonances , however , the distance between the levels is reduced to half the superlattice period .",
    "therefore , an additional factor of 2 has to be included , i.e. , @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the energy of the receiving state in the barrier .",
    "the voltages for the @xmath24 resonances @xmath20 and @xmath21 are calculated using eq .",
    "( [ resonances1 ] ) resulting in 5.4 and 14.6  v for the 9.0/4.0 sample , respectively .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ resonances2 ] ) , we obtain a resonance voltage of 8.2  v for the @xmath34 resonance in this sample .",
    "all values agree well with the observed values .",
    "note that all observed resonances appear at slightly higher voltages due to field inhomogeneities and screening effects .",
    "to investigate the electric field inside the superlattice , photoluminescence ( pl ) measurements have been performed.@xcite due to the quantum - confined stark effect ( qcse ) , the pl from regions with strong electric fields is red - shifted with respect to the pl from low - field regions .",
    "the experiments reveal that in both plateau regions of this sample the pl consists of two peaks with their respective intensity depending on the applied bias voltage .",
    "this stark - splitting of the pl signal is taken as direct evidence for the existence of two distinct electric - field domains , which are formed because of ndv and current conservation . for the first plateau the consequence of this conservation law",
    "is depicted by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ slwfield](b ) . clearly , the electric field of the low - field domain ( @xmath35 ) corresponds to the @xmath22 resonance peak , while the field strength of the high field domain ( @xmath36 ) lies on the next rising branch of the @xmath0 characteristics slightly below the @xmath20 resonance.@xcite applied to the second plateau , the current conservation law ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ iv6750 ] ) shows that the high field domain in this voltage region forms as a consequence of resonant transport through the @xmath37 level in the barriers ( @xmath34 transport ) .",
    "in contrast to previous work,@xcite where this new formation mechanism was considered for the first time , this measurements provide the first direct evidence relating @xmath25-levels in the barriers to domain formation .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that it is not very surprising to observe domain formation due to transport through the @xmath37 level . for domain formation to occur , only a _ minimum of the @xmath0 curve _ is required in conjunction with a sufficiently high carrier density.@xcite in that sense the subject of domain formation and conditions for oscillations can be discussed simply by looking at the @xmath0 curve as discussed in a companion paper.@xcite    in the 13.3/2.7 sample the calculated @xmath34 resonance ( @xmath38v ) is located between the @xmath21 and @xmath39 resonances , which are calculated to be at 9.5 and 17.9  v , respectively .",
    "consequently , the i - v characteristic exhibits three plateaus as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ iv6173 ] .",
    "the thin dashed line has been added to indicate the positions of the transport maxima for homogeneous fields .",
    "unlike in the 9.0/4.0 sample , the pl in the plateau regions shows no stark splitting indicating that the field distribution inside the sl is less sharply defined . a possible explanation of this behavior is the existence of rather broad resonances in this weakly doped superlattice",
    ". however , the i - v characteristics shows some clear signs of domain formation ( e.g. , current branches@xcite ) , but the differences between the electric field values of these domains seem to be rather small .",
    "since the qcse is quadratic in the electric field , the peaks of the two domains can not be resolved in the pl experiments . because stable electric field domains have been investigated intensively over the last years",
    ", we will not discuss the stationary regime any further .",
    "we will rather focus on the non - stationary behavior instead .",
    "the absence of a regular pattern of current branches in the plateaus is a first hint that the field distribution inside the sl may not always be stable .",
    "indeed , the current , e.g. , in the lower plateau of the 9.0/4.0 sample ( fig .",
    "[ trace6750 ] ) , shows a strongly time - dependent component , which has been attributed to an oscillatory instability of the field distribution inside the superlattice.@xcite during one cycle of the oscillation a monopole forms near the cathode , drifts through the superlattice towards the anode and dissolves , while a new monopole is formed.@xcite this type of oscillation is denoted the first oscillation mode .",
    "it is interesting to note that the displayed trace also contains a number of small current spikes . supported by simulations , voltage turn - on measurements",
    "have shown that these small spikes are due to well - to - well hopping of the domain boundary moving through the superlattice.@xcite thus , the number of current spikes indicates how many superlattice periods are involved in the oscillation . for the displayed oscillation",
    "this leads to a number close to thirty , which allows to speculate that for this particular voltage the domain boundary crosses about three quarters of the superlattice during one cycle of the oscillation .    to analyze the oscillations in more detail ,",
    "we have measured the voltage dependence of the oscillation frequency within the plateaus .",
    "the fourier transform@xcite exhibits a series of frequency maxima , of which we take the fundamental frequency as the oscillation frequency of the field distribution .",
    "the voltage dependence of the oscillation frequency in the two plateaus of the 9.0/4.0 sample is plotted in fig .",
    "[ freq6750 ] showing that the observed frequencies in the first plateau are weakly voltage dependent , while in the second plateau there is no dependence on the applied voltage at all .",
    "the noticeable increase of the frequency with voltage at the end of the first plateau is due to the charge monopole having less room to travel from the beginning of the superlattice to the position of the high field domain .",
    "in both plateaus there are regions , where sinusoidal oscillations could not be observed . in these regions",
    "the current contains a time dependent component , which is not periodic and therefore difficult to measure .",
    "in particular the discontinuities in the frequency at the beginning of the first plateau suggest that the oscillations may become chaotic , when the charge monopole oscillates near the contacts .",
    "while chaotic behavior has been shown to exist theoretically in the case of an external driving frequency , @xcite the boundary regions of the plateaus are still under investigation in this respect .",
    "very recently driven and undriven chaos have been observed in this system.@xcite note that chaotic behavior has also been observed at the onset of trap - dominated gunn oscillations in ultra - pure p - ge.@xcite this behavior is due to intermittent switching between small and large amplitude current oscillations,@xcite although its theoretical interpretation remains uncertain.@xcite      in contrast to the 9.0/4.0 sample , the frequencies of the oscillations in the 13.3/2.7 sample exhibit a pronounced voltage dependence as shown in fig .",
    "[ hf6173 ] for three different temperatures in the third plateau .",
    "the oscillations begin to appear close to the resonance maximum and decrease monotonically with increasing voltage .",
    "furthermore , in this sample oscillations are only detected near the beginning of the plateaus in the region of ndv .",
    "this observation not only applies to the third plateau , but also to the first and second plateaus .",
    "thus , there is a clear difference between the oscillations observed in these two samples . unlike in the 9.0/4.0 sample",
    ", the time - resolved pl does not show an oscillating two - domain solution,@xcite but merely an intensity modulated broad line .",
    "these two differences are taken as a signature for the existence of a different oscillatory mode in this sample , which is not related to well - defined electric field domains .    in fig .",
    "[ ghz465 ] the experimental results on the 9.0/1.5 sample are shown . in this case",
    "we used a 25  @xmath18 m mesa in order to keep the current at a reasonable level .",
    "due to the stronger coupling , ghz oscillations are already observed in the lowest plateau .",
    "in addition to a strong voltage dependence of the frequency , there is also an abrupt jump to lower values .",
    "higher plateaus could not be measured due to the large increase in current at about 8  v. time - resolved pl spectra on a 120  @xmath18 m mesa do not show two well - separated lines . however , intensity oscillations with the same frequencies are clearly observed .",
    "current oscillations on these large mesas are also measured using pulsed electric fields to avoid the heating of the sample .",
    "[ iv6173 ] shows the current voltage characteristic of the 13.3/2.7 sample at room temperature .",
    "from the fact that it still shows the plateau - like features related to resonant tunneling one can speculate that the oscillations may also be found at higher temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ hf6173 ] the oscillations in the third plateau are observed up to 200  k , while in fig .",
    "[ rt6173 ] tunable oscillations indeed exist even at 295  k in the case of the second plateau .",
    "these results are very encouraging , because they prove that a device such as a frequency generator based on the recently found tunable oscillatory mode can in principle be manufactured . however , in order to obtain well - defined resonances even at room temperature , one probably has to switch to another material system with stronger confinement .",
    "for example , superlattices based on ingaas / inalas material system exhibit pronounced plateaus even at room temperature.@xcite therefore , it is expected that with properly chosen parameters oscillators based on ingaas / inalas superlattices can be operated at room temperature .",
    "in order to explain why the frequency depends in one case on the applied voltage , while it is voltage independent in the other case , the condition for the two oscillatory modes has to be investigated in more detail .",

    "we will assume that initially ( point marked with 1 in fig .",

    "the domain wall is approximately centered at @xmath153 so that the voltage bias condition of eq .",

    "the current decreases until a certain minimum value slightly smaller than @xmath154 is reached .",
    "then a new high - field domain is created ( close to the beginning of the sl ) and the current rises sharply as the two domain walls move towards the end of the sl .",
    "when the current is near its maximum value , the old domain wall disappears as the values of the field in the intermediate and rightmost domains coalesce .",
    "then one period of the oscillation is completed .",
    "all these features can be understood by means of an asymptotic analysis to be reported elsewhere .",
    "@xcite some of the basic ideas were sketched in ref .  .",
    "clearly , a superlattice oscillator based on the above described types of oscillations may be exploited in a device , e.g. , by operating the superlattice as a frequency generator . in order to establish the use of the newly found oscillations ,",
    "it is important to know what maximum frequency can be achieved .",
    "while experimental investigations in this direction are still missing , it is clear that the ultimate frequency limit will be connected with the maximum drift velocity , which can be achieved without destroying the shape of the @xmath0 curve .",
    "to first order we assume that the oscillation frequency is determined _ only _ by the transition time of the carriers through the sample .",
    "this approach neglects a possible oscillation of the domain boundary over a few periods only , but allows to give an estimate for the oscillation frequencies from the current density @xmath155 , the 3d doping density @xmath156 , and the length @xmath157 of the sample using @xmath158 in fig .",
    "[ frequencies ] the measured oscillation frequencies are plotted versus the frequencies calculated using eq .",
    "( [ frequency ] ) . for each plateau in the 9.0/4.0 sample",
    "only one measured frequency is shown , while for the 13.3/2.7 and 9.0/1.5 samples the measured minimum and maximum frequencies are plotted .",
    "the figure shows a strong correlation between drift velocity and oscillation frequency over several orders of magnitude .",
    "the highest observed _ miniband _ drift velocities are on the order of 10@xmath159  cm / s which , as sibille et al.@xcite pointed out , for a superlattice of 500@xmath160 nm length translates into a fundamental frequency of 200 ghz .",
    "however , the electric fields in the reported case can not be increased arbitrarily without breaking up the miniband , while for the subband field - oscillator this limitation does not apply .",
    "accordingly , the observed frequencies become larger for higher subband resonances , which for sufficiently thin barriers will push the drift velocities and the frequencies to new limits . looking at the oscillation frequency as a function of barrier width",
    ", we note that a change of a factor of 2.67 in barrier width leads to a change in the oscillation frequency in the first plateau of a factor of about 4000 . projecting this behavior for other material systems to feasible barrier widths ,",
    "we conclude that the frequencies could reach the 100  ghz range .",
    "hence , in contrast to gunn - effect devices , the oscillation frequency of the superlattice oscillator is not only defined by the length of the sample , but also by the parameters of the heterostructure . in this respect",
    "the superlattice oscillator leaves much more room for optimization .",
    "additionally , a frequency generator based on a superlattice oscillator with several plateaus may cover several orders of magnitude with one device .",
    "in particular the tunability _ within the plateaus _ at high frequencies allows to envision a tunable frequency generator based on resonant carrier transport covering the whole ghz regime , which to our knowledge no other device is capable of .",
    "we have demonstrated that doped , weakly coupled semiconductor superlattices exhibit current self - oscillations with ghz frequencies , which can be tuned by simply changing the applied voltage .",
    "the oscillations , which are observed in gaas - alas superlattices , are not limited to low temperatures , but in one case have been observed at room temperature .",
    "they occur due to an unstable electric - field domain formation .",
    "a theoretical modeling , both analytical and numerical , demonstrates that three different oscillatory modes can occur , which depend on the detailed shape of the drift velocity curve , the doping density , the boundary condition , and the length of the superlattice .",
    "in contrast to the bloch - oscillator proposed by esaki and tsu,@xcite the self - oscillations of the field distribution are in most cases due to a formation , motion , and recycling of a charge accumulation layer inside the superlattice . in some cases",
    "the domain boundary is localized over a few quantum wells , while the field strengths of the low and high field domain oscillate .",
    "we would like to stress that the observed oscillations are also different from the damped miniband oscillations observed by le person et al.,@xcite because they occur only at field strengths , where the miniband is already destroyed by wannier - stark localization .",
    "considered from a macroscopic point of view in the sense that a traveling charge accumulation layer generates the oscillation in the current , the oscillations in doped superlattices are similar to the moving field domains in gunn diodes . in both cases",
    "the nonlinearity , which is responsible for the instability , is generated by negative differential velocity .",
    "the microscopic origin , however , is entirely different with important consequences for the frequency limit and the tunability .    in conclusion",
