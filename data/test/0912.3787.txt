    "more than a century after the discovery of cosmic rays ( crs ) , their origin is still mysterious and their propagation in the interstellar space subject of long - standing debates .",
    "interactions between crs and interstellar gas give rise to @xmath0 rays through @xmath4 decay and bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "in addition , cr electrons and positrons produce @xmath0 rays through inverse compton scattering on the low energy interstellar radiation field .",
    "thus , @xmath0 rays can probe cr densities in the solar neighborhood , beyond the direct measurements in the solar system , as well as in remote parts of the galaxy .    on the other hand",
    ", the interstellar @xmath0-ray emission usefully complements gas and dust tracers at other wavelengths to probe the interstellar medium ( ism ) column densities .",
    "two main radio / microwave tracers of the ism have long been used in @xmath0-ray astrophysics : the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen , @xmath3 , and the 2.6 mm line of carbon monoxide , co. there are , however , open issues in the derivation of gas column densities from these observations , and hints that their combination does not provide an exhaustive census of the gas in the ism .    in this contribution , we add a few pieces to this intriguing puzzle with the use of _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) data for the second galactic quadrant , at @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "this region has been selected due to the presence of conspicuous atomic and molecular complexes and the good kinematic separation between the different structures seen along the line of sight . moving toward the outer galaxy , the region encompasses complexes that are part of the gould belt ( within @xmath7  pc from the solar system ) , of the local arm ( @xmath8  kpc ) , of the perseus arm ( @xmath9  kpc ) and of the outer spiral arm ( @xmath10  kpc ) .",
    "the analysis is described in detail in   @xcite .",
    "we summarize below the main results and discuss their physical implications .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emissivity of atomic gas can be estimated by comparing @xmath0-ray and radio data because the 21 cm line of the @xmath3 hyperfine transition allows us to derive hydrogen column densities , @xmath11 .",
    "the results presented here are based on the often - used assumption ( in @xmath0-ray astrophysics ) of a uniform @xmath3 spin temperature of 125 k. there are , however , large uncertainties in the gas spin temperature , as well as non - uniformities within a single interstellar complex .",
    "the issue of the @xmath11 determination will be further discussed in section  [ ismtrac ] .    in fig .",
    "[ locemiss ] we show the differential emissivity per @xmath3 atom measured in the gould belt .     atom measured in the gould belt .",
    "black points are our measurements , the shaded area gives the systematic uncertainties due to the lat event selection efficiency .",
    "the lines represent the predictions by the galprop model ` 54_71xvarh7s`.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the results are compared with the predictions by galprop , a widely used code for cr propagation @xcite .",
    "the results are consistent with an independent study of lat measurements at intermediate galactic latitudes in the third quadrant @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 emissivity in the gould belt obviously exceeds the galprop prediction by @xmath12 .",
    "however , the normalization of the spectrum is consistent with the expectations within the actual constraints . in the energy range",
    "considered ( 200 mev",
    " 10 gev ) the emission is dominated by the pionic component due to hadronic interactions .",
    "an important source of uncertainty comes from systematic errors in cr measurements : the current literature reports differences up to @xmath13 for the proton spectrum .",
    "an additional @xmath14 uncertainty is due to the contribution from heavier nuclei in both crs and the ism .",
    "the galprop model we adopted , following the method by dermer @xcite , predicts an effective enhancement of @xmath15 with respect to pure @xmath16-@xmath16 emissivities .",
    "different authors , however , report values as high as @xmath17  @xcite .    provided a 50% scaling of the emissivity , the spectral shape is in good agreement with the expectations .",
    "thus we can conclude that cr nuclei in the local ism are similar to those measured at earth : further constraints will be given by improved direct measurements of crs ( by missions like pamela and ams02 ) .",
    "this is an additional evidence that lat measurements are not consistent with the gev excess seen by egret ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as already deduced by lat observations at intermediate galactic latitudes @xcite",
    ". a deviation with respect to the expected spectral shape of diffuse @xmath0-ray emission was observed by egret over the whole sky for energies @xmath18 gev , leading to several possible interpretations : instrumental effects , differences between typical cr spectra in the ism and those in the proximities of the earth , dark matter annihilation .",
    "the gev excess was noticed also in the @xmath3 emissivity of local interstellar complexes @xcite , being inconsistent with the results of our analysis . the same kind of difference is noticed in the spectra of bright point sources , notably for the vela pulsar  @xcite , and so the differences between the spectra measured by egret and those measured by the lat are plausibly instrumental in origin .",
    "the molecular phase of the ism is difficult to trace , because its major constituent , @xmath20 , does not have observable emission lines in its cold phase .",
    "the 2.6 mm line of the co @xmath21 transition has often been used as a surrogate tracer of molecular masses .",
    "observations , notably virial mass calculations , suggest that the velocity - integrated antenna temperature @xmath22 , despite the optical thickness , is proportional to the total mass in the emitting region @xcite .",
    "the conversion factor which transforms @xmath22 intensity into @xmath23 column density is known as @xmath1 . for many years",
    "it has been considered as uniform across the galaxy , but we have now evidence from virial masses @xcite , from cobe / dirbe observations @xcite , and from the @xmath24 dependence on metallicity in external galaxies @xcite that it increases with galactocentric radius .",
    "such an increase was shown to be consistent with egret data @xcite , but the limited performance of previous @xmath0-ray telescopes did not allow to get accurate measurements in the outer galaxy @xcite .",
    "high - energy @xmath0-ray observations provide important constraints on @xmath24 values .",
    "since the molecular binding energy is negligible with respect to the energy scale of the @xmath0 radiation processes , the emissivity per @xmath20 molecule is twice the emissivity per @xmath3 atom for gas threaded by the same cr flux .",
    "this statement relies on the assumption that cr diffusion lengths are large enough to ensure similar cr spectra in the atomic and molecular phases of a complex ( i.e. they do not vary significantly over distances of tens of pc ) and that crs penetrate molecular clouds uniformly to their core in spite of the enhanced magnetic fields ( idea still under debate ) .",
    "the results of our work allowed us to correlate the integrated emissivity per @xmath22 unit ( @xmath25 ) and per @xmath3 atom ( @xmath26 ) in different regions along the line of sight , for several energy bands from 200 mev to 10 gev .",
    "the results are shown for the local arm in fig .",
    "[ qhico ] .     and",
    "@xmath26 over 5 energy ranges between 200 mev and 10 gev in the local arm clouds .",
    "the solid red line represents the best linear fit .",
    "the fit uses the measurement uncertainties on both axes.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the good linear correlation supports the assumption of similar spectra in the atomic and molecular phases of the clouds and the energy - independent penetration of crs to the molecular cores .",
    "the slope of the linear relation provides an estimate of the @xmath24 ratio .",
    "good linear correlations are also found for the gould belt clouds and in the perseus arm .",
    "the values of @xmath24 in the different regions are summarized in fig .",
    "[ xcor ] as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "values measured in the gould belt , local and perseus arm ( from left to right ) .",
    "blue dashed line : model by strong et al .",
    "green solid line : the conversion function based on virial masses by nakanishi and sofue @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the results confirm a significant but moderate increase of @xmath24 with galactocentric radius .",
    "the gradient is consistent with the metallicity decrease in the outer milky way and the strong relation seen between metallicity and @xmath24 in external galaxies @xcite .",
    "this relation is plausibly due to poor self - shielding against co photodissociation by uv radiation in low metallicity environments .",
    "our results do not support the extremely large gradient proposed by strong et al .",
    "@xcite beyond the solar circle ( dashed blue line in fig .  [ xcor ] ) .",
    "the latter was introduced on the basis of non-@xmath0-ray data to alleviate the _ cr gradient problem _ ( see below section  [ crsec ] ) .",
    "we find a value significantly lower than the prediction of this model for the molecular complex associated with ngc  7538 and cas  a in the perseus arm , which is the most massive molecular complex beyond the solar circle .",
    "the values of @xmath24 we measured are systematically lower than the conversion law derived by nakanishi and sofue  @xcite from virial masses .",
    "we have verified that a difference of comparable magnitude is found for our clouds between the masses derived from the @xmath24 ratios just measured and the virial masses ( based on the same co data used for the @xmath0-ray analysis ) @xcite . an instrumental origin of the discrepancy ( e.g. calibration differences between different co datasets ) is therefore unlikely .",
    "as already said , the @xmath0-ray masses may be biased by the non - uniform penetration of crs within the dense cores of the clouds .",
    "the limited spatial resolution of the @xmath0-ray data may also lead to separation problems between the molecular phase of a cloud and its dense atomic envelope .",
    "on the other hand , virial masses rely on rather crude hypotheses : spherical clouds with simple density profiles and turbulent support to hold a cloud in equilibrium against gravitational collapse .",
    "the effects of magnetic support are rarely considered ( they were not in our calculation ) and intrinsic velocity gradients can broaden the velocity dispersion .",
    "the virial estimate also corresponds to the total dynamical mass , whereas the @xmath0-ray estimate corresponds to the mass spatially associated with co. gas not properly accounted for by @xmath22 intensities could explain , at least in part , the differences between the virial and @xmath0-ray masses ( see below section  [ ismtrac ] ) .",
    "the cr origin is still unclear . the egret non - detection of the small magellanic cloud @xcite , an external galaxy member of the local group , highlighted that its cr content significantly differs from that of the milky way .",
    "the egret upper limit was recognized as evidence that crs , at least below @xmath27 ev , have a galactic origin .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) have been considered for many years the best candidates as cr accelerators in our galaxy . whereas diffusive acceleration of electrons by snr shock waves is obvious from multiwavelength observations , only recently we started accumulating indirect evidence for the acceleration of cr nuclei @xmath0-ray observations in the tev @xcite and gev domain @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the distribution of snrs in the galaxy is very poorly determined @xcite because of the sparsity of the known sample ( a few tens ) and its large selection effects . since the cos - b era it is well known that the gas @xmath0-ray emissivity gradient across the outer galaxy is much flatter than expected from the decline in snr detections @xcite .",
    "strong et al .",
    "@xcite proposed to use the observed pulsar distribution to trace cr sources because of their richer sample @xcite .",
    "large uncertainties in the distance derivation from the dispersion measurements can , however , easily bias their radial distribution .",
    "the decline in pulsar counts in the outer galaxy is even steeper than the snr one , strengthening the _ cr gradient problem_. strong et al .",
    "@xcite attempted to alleviate this problem by increasing the amount of molecular gas in the outer galaxy , invoking a strong increase of @xmath24 beyond the solar circle . yet , tuning the @xmath24 ratio does not explain the flat @xmath26 emissivity gradient recorded in the ubiquitous and massive atomic phase @xcite . as discussed in section  [ xcograd ]",
    "this solution is disfavored by lat measurements .",
    "our measurements of the @xmath3 emissivity across the outer galaxy are shown in fig .",
    "[ qhifig ] .",
    "emissivities integrated between 200 mev and 10 gev ( @xmath26 ) measured in the gould belt , local , perseus and outer arm ( from left to right ) .",
    "black points are our measurements , the grey shaded area represents the systematic uncertainties in the lat event selection efficiency .",
    "the blue dashed line gives the prediction by the galprop model ` 54_71xvarh7s`.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the results are compared with the predictions by a galprop model which uses a cr source distribution derived from pulsars .",
    "the _ cr gradient problem _ is confirmed by lat data : the measured decline in emissivity is much flatter than the prediction by galprop for the pulsar ( fig .",
    "[ qhifig ] ) and also the snr distribution ( _ fermi _ lat collaboration , in preparation ) .",
    "systematically underestimating the remote @xmath11 densities as the result of self - absorption phenomena can lead to a bias in the emissivity gradient . correcting for @xmath3 self absorption , gibson et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that a significant amount of @xmath3 mass has been overlooked by emission surveys in the second quadrant for the outer galaxy .",
    "the large emissivity in the outer galaxy may be explained also by a population of unresolved sources clustering in the perseus arm structures .    on the other hand , if the flat gradient is real , it challenges either the snrs as cr parent population or the modeling of cr diffusion across the galaxy . a possible explanation is provided by the large uncertainties on the snr distribution .",
    "additionally , the cr propagation parameters are usually derived from the isotopic composition of crs measured at earth ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a reasonable assumption , but not required by observational constraints . an alternative scenario is given by non - uniform cr diffusion @xcite .",
    "the modeling of the @xmath0-ray interstellar emission based on the combination of @xmath3 and co data is being challenged by observations .",
    "egret data , compared with other tracers , already suggested that a significant amount of gas is not properly traced by these radio / microwave lines @xcite . the nearby , off - plane , clouds located in the gould belt",
    "are well suited to probe ism tracers , both because there is little confusion along the line of sight and because the higher linear resolution of the @xmath0-ray data within the clouds allows a good separation of the emission arising from the different phases and sources .       following the method proposed by grenier et al .",
    "@xcite , we have used interstellar dust as an additional gas tracer under the assumption that dust grains are well mixed with gas in the cold and warm phases of the ism under study .",
    "we have used the total dust column densities provided by the color excess @xmath28 map by schlegel et al .",
    "@xcite . from this map",
    "we have subtracted the parts linearly correlated with the best - fit combination of @xmath11 and @xmath22 maps built for the four regions separated along the lines of sight , from the gould belt to the outer arm @xcite .",
    "the residual map is shown in fig .",
    "[ maps ] on the left . within a few degrees from the galactic plane ,",
    "the map exhibits clumps of positive and negative residuals .",
    "their origin is unclear because of the intrinsic limitations of the @xmath28 map near the plane @xcite . at intermediate latitudes ( @xmath29 ) , the map is dominated by structured envelopes of positive residuals surrounding the gould belt co clouds . for comparison the @xmath22 map is shown on the right of fig .",
    "smaller negative residuals are found toward the dense co cores .",
    "adding the @xmath28 residual map significantly improves the fit to the @xmath0-ray data  @xcite .",
    "given the spatial correlation , we compared the @xmath0-ray emissivities per unit of @xmath28 residuals ( @xmath30 ) with the emissivities per @xmath3 atom ( @xmath26 ) in the gould - belt clouds .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ qhiebv ] .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission arising from hadronic interactions of crs with dust grains is too faint to be detected .",
    "the ic emission coming from dust infrared emission up scattered by cr electrons is also expected to be faint and spectrally different from the @xmath4-decay radiation associated with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the results point to the presence of additional gas which is not properly accounted for in the @xmath11 and @xmath22 maps .",
    "the negative residuals seen towards the co cores can be interpreted as small local variations in the dust - to - gas ratio or in the dust thermal emissivity in the denser , well - shielded parts of the molecular clouds .",
    "the nature of the additional gas , however , is not determined yet .",
    "substantial uncertainties result from the approximations applied to handle the radiative transport of the @xmath3 lines .",
    "the choice of a uniform spin temperature , @xmath31 k , has often been adopted in the past , as in our study .",
    "recent absorption surveys @xcite propose higher values in the outer galaxy ( @xmath32 k ) which would yield @xmath11 densities lower than the present estimates .",
    "conversely , colder and denser @xmath3 gas with @xmath33 as low as @xmath34 k is quite abundant in the mid - latitude clouds @xcite .",
    "this phase contributes much larger @xmath11 column - densities than the estimates based on a uniform spin temperature of a few hundreds k. self absorption could also bias the @xmath11 column densities to low values .",
    "on the other hand , at the interface between the atomic and co - traced phase of an interstellar complex we might find an additional phase where @xmath20 exists but it is not well mixed with co ( e.g. because @xmath20 is more efficiently self - shielded than co in the low extinction range ) or densities are too low to excite the co 2.6 mm line transition @xcite . a poor correlation with @xmath22 maps and , conversely , a good correlation with the @xmath28 color excess has already been shown for alternative molecular tracers ( like the 9 cm line of ch ) in translucent molecular clouds , and possibly proposed for the translucent envelopes of giant molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include nasa and doe in the united states , cea / irfu and in2p3/cnrs in france , asi and infn in italy , mext , kek , and jaxa in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the national space board in sweden . additional support from inaf in italy and cnes in france for science analysis during the operations phase is also gratefully acknowledged ."
