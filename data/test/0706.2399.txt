    "cosmic acceleration can arise either from an unknown component of dark energy with negative pressure or a modification to gravity that only appears at cosmological scales and densities .",
    "additional terms in the einstein - hilbert action that are non - linear functions @xmath0 of the ricci scalar @xmath1 have long been known to cause acceleration @xcite and have been the subject of much recent interest @xcite .    the main challenge for @xmath0 models as a complete description of gravity lies with the extremely tight constraints on such modifications placed by solar system and local tests of general relativity .",
    "chiba @xcite showed that the fundamental problem is that @xmath0 models generically introduce a light scalar degree of freedom with a long compton wavelength at cosmological densities @xcite .",
    "this problem can be mitigated by the so - called chameleon mechanism @xcite , where the local compton wavelength can decrease in high density environments @xcite .",
    "the cosmological compton wavelength can then be a scale of cosmological interest .",
    "nevertheless , it must typically be less than a few tens of mpc if the galactic gravitational potential is not substantially deeper than implied by local rotation curve measurements @xcite .    in this _",
    "paper _ , we take the perspective that @xmath0 models are effective theories that are valid at cosmological densities and scales and are not necessarily predictive at the high densities and small scales of local tests .",
    "hence we explore models with compton wavelengths out to the horizon size and seek to constrain them from cosmological observables alone . at the very least ,",
    "this exploration yields a cosmological test of general relativity that is independent of local constraints .",
    "although @xmath0 models can change the expansion history during the acceleration epoch , there in principle always exists a dark energy model that provides the same history .",
    "the unique and strongest signatures of @xmath0 modifications are on cosmological structure formation @xcite and can impact observables down to compton wavelengths of a few mpc @xcite .",
    "we consider constraints arising from the cmb angular power spectrum measured by wmap @xcite , the linear matter power spectrum inferred from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample @xcite , the distance measures by the supernovae legacy survey ( snls ) @xcite , and the cross - correlation between the cmb and large scale structure as measured by wmap and a range of galaxy and quasar surveys @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : methodology ] , we review the @xmath0 model and discuss our calculation and analysis methods . in  [ sec : constraints ] we present the results of joint cosmological constraints on these models .",
    "we discuss these results in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in @xmath0 models of gravity , the einstein - hilbert action is supplemented by a term that is non - linear in the ricci scalar @xmath1 s = d^4x , where @xmath2 is the matter lagrangian .",
    "the modified einstein and friedmann equations result from varying the action with respect to the metric .",
    "given the freedom to choose a functional form for @xmath0 , any desired expansion history can be replicated @xcite . in particular",
    ", one can choose the @xmath3cdm expansion history which is known to satisfy distance constraints from high redshift supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillations and the cmb .",
    "even given the degeneracy with dark energy in the expansion history , @xmath0 models have distinguishable effects on the formation of structure .",
    "the promotion of the ricci scalar to a dynamical degree of freedom modifies the force law between particles .",
    "this modified force is mediated by a new scalar degree of freedom @xmath4 , which has a squared compton wavelength proportional to @xmath5 . below the compton wavelength scale gravity",
    "becomes a scalar - tensor theory , leading to an enhancement in the growth of cosmological density perturbations and a corresponding suppression in the decay of gravitational potentials .    for cosmological tests ,",
    "it is convenient to express the squared compton wavelength in the background in units of the hubble length squared @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the scale factor and the ricci scalar is evaluated at the background density .",
    "we will specialize our consideration to @xmath0 models that exactly reproduce the @xmath3cdm expansion history to test whether the unique signatures of @xmath0 gravity are seen in current cosmological data sets .    under this assumption",
    ", the additional degree of freedom in @xmath0 gravity is parameterized by the value of @xmath8 today , @xmath9 .",
    "stability requires the mass squared of the scalar to be positive ( _ i.e. _  a prior of @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "note that in the limit that @xmath11 , the phenomenology of @xmath3cdm is recovered in structure formation tests as well as expansion history tests .",
    "more generally , the control parameter is the average compton wavelength through the acceleration epoch when gravity is modified .",
    "the fundamental observables of our @xmath0 model are the same as in @xmath3cdm .",
    "these include the redshift - distance relation , the cmb angular power spectrum @xmath12 , galaxy power spectra @xmath13 , and the angular correlation between galaxies and the cmb @xmath14 .",
    "cosmic shear , dark matter halo profiles and masses from weak lensing as well as the cluster abundance are also potential observables but their utilization requires cosmological simulations that are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we modified the boltzmann code camb @xcite to calculate these observables in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "in the camb code , the density perturbations are computed in the synchronous gauge .",
    "we evolve the usual boltzmann code up to @xmath15 when deviations introduced by @xmath0 are still small . at this epoch",
    ", we transform the matter perturbations from synchronous gauge to gauge invariant variables , and feed them as initial conditions to the linear perturbation equations for the density fluctuation and cmb sources ( see @xcite eqs .",
    "28 - 35 ) .",
    "once the initial conditions are specified , the power spectrum observables are computed from a separate @xmath0 routine that bypasses the usual camb code without significantly increasing the computational time .",
    "as we shall discuss , the main modification made by our @xmath0 models on the cmb is a change in the evolution of gravitational potentials during the acceleration epoch .",
    "the cmb power spectrum is modified at low multipoles through the so called  integrated sachs - wolfe \" ( isw ) effect , and the temperature field is correlated with tracers of gravitational potentials such as galaxies .",
    "this correlation is strong if the redshift of the galaxies is matched to the epoch at which the gravitational potentials evolve .",
    "following @xcite , we model the angular correlation between a set of galaxy surveys indexed by @xmath16 and the cmb , assuming a broad band selection function for the galaxies , n_i(z)=e^-(z / z_i)^1.5 , where the @xmath17 are chosen to match the median redshift in the surveys . while crude , the uncertainties introduced by this choice of selection function are smaller than the difference in model predictions that will be considered . the galaxy bias is assumed to be constant in each redshift bin .",
    "we calculate the cross power spectrum between galaxy number density and cmb temperature following @xcite ( eqs .",
    "55 - 60 ) and transform it to the angular power correlation function @xmath18 .",
    "we use a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique @xcite to evaluate the likelihood function of model parameters .",
    "the mcmc is used to simulate observations from the posterior distribution @xmath19 , of a set of parameters @xmath20 given event @xmath21 , obtained via bayes theorem , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the likelihood of event @xmath21 given the model parameters @xmath20 and @xmath24 is the prior probability density .",
    "the mcmc generates random draws ( i.e.  simulations ) from the posterior distribution that are a `` fair '' sample of the likelihood surface . from this sample",
    ", we can estimate all of the quantities of interest about the posterior distribution ( mean , variance , confidence levels ) .",
    "a properly derived and implemented mcmc draws from the joint posterior density @xmath25 once it has converged to the stationary distribution .",
    "we use 16 chains and a conservative gelman - rubin convergence criterion @xcite to determine when the chains have converged to the stationary distribution .    for our application",
    ", @xmath20 denotes a set of cosmological parameters .",
    "we then use a modified version of the cosmomc code @xcite to determine constraints placed on this parameter space by wmap , sdss lrg galaxy power spectrum , and supernova distance measures . for the lrg data ,",
    "we only use the first 14 @xmath26-bins in our fits reflecting a conservative cut for linearity @xmath27/mpc . for the supernovae constraint , we take the supernovae legacy survey data set and its analysis remains unaffected by our @xmath0 modification .",
    "likewise , its impact is mainly to help determine expansion history parameters . in our analysis",
    ", we take the parameter set @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the angular size of the acoustic horizon , and @xmath32 is the power in the primordial curvature perturbation at @xmath33 .",
    "the universe is assumed to be to be spatially flat .",
    "recall also that we fix the expansion history to be the same as a @xmath3cdm model .",
    "hence @xmath34 is also a proxy for the hubble constant @xmath35 km / s / mpc or @xmath36 .",
    "the last two parameters in the set are the linear galaxy bias @xmath37 and non - linearity parameter @xmath38 required for the interpretation of the galaxy power spectrum @xmath39 of sdss lrgs @xcite ( see also  [ sec : pk ] ) , defined as @xmath40 the linear bias factor @xmath37 is defined with respect to the linear matter power spectrum @xmath41 at @xmath42 , the effective redshift of the lrg galaxies . since @xmath0 models predict a scale dependent growth rate that changes the shape of the power spectrum as a function of redshift , we do not define the bias as relative to the power spectrum at @xmath43 ( _ cf . _",
    "the second factor on the right hand side accounts for the non - linear evolution of the matter power spectrum shape and the scale - dependent bias of the galaxies relative to dark matter .",
    "we assume that this _ ansatz _ continues to be a valid approximation for @xmath0 theories .",
    "we do not marginalize analytically over the @xmath37 and @xmath38 parameters as is done normally in the cosmomc code ; instead the parameters are marginalized numerically as independent nuisance parameters in the mcmc analysis .    for all of our parameters except for @xmath44 , we employ flat linear priors in the stated parameters . for @xmath44 , we supplement the flat prior with the stability condition that @xmath45 .",
    "finally , these constraints are projected onto the space of the galaxy - isw angular correlation function for comparison with the data .",
    "we do not attempt here to include the correlation function data in the likelihood .",
    "that would require a joint re - analysis of the various data sets to capture the covariance between the measurements .",
    "it would also require an assessment of systematic errors in the correlation due to uncertainties in the selection functions and other effects .",
    "instead we compare predictions with the individual measurements and their errors as quoted in the literature .",
    "in @xmath0 models that follow the @xmath3cdm expansion history considered here , none of the cmb phenomenology at recombination is affected by the modification to gravity .",
    "the compton wavelength parameter @xmath8 is driven rapidly to zero at high density and curvature . hence all of the successes of @xmath3cdm in explaining the acoustic peaks carries over to these @xmath0 models .",
    "the impact of @xmath0 gravity on the cmb comes exclusively through the so - called integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect at the lowest multipole moments .",
    "the isw effect arises from an imbalance between the blueshift a cmb photon suffers while falling into a gravitational potential well and the redshift while climbing out if the gravitational potential evolves during transit . with a cosmological constant , gravitational potentials decay during the acceleration epoch . for @xmath0 models ,",
    "the enhancement of the growth rate below the compton scale can change the decay into growth ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pot ] ) .",
    "this reversal changes the sign of the isw effect .",
    "cmb photons then become colder along directions associated with overdense regions .",
    "= 3.3truein    fig .",
    "[ fig : cl ] illustrates the impact of this effect on the cmb power spectrum .",
    "as the compton wavelength approaches the gpc ( @xmath46 mpc@xmath47 ) scales associated with the low multipoles of the isw effect , the reduction in the decay of the potential also suppresses the isw effect . near @xmath48",
    "the isw effect is almost entirely absent at the quadrupole .",
    "reduction in the amplitude of the quadrupole is in fact weakly favored by the data but the large cosmic variance of the low multipoles prevents this from being a significant improvement .",
    "moreover , the elimination of the isw effect at higher multipoles where the observed power is higher counteracts this improvement . for @xmath49",
    "the compton wavelength exceeds the scales of interest and potential decay turns to potential growth .",
    "by @xmath50 the isw effect has an equal amplitude to that of @xmath3cdm . for @xmath51",
    ", it is too large to accommodate the wmap data .",
    "these features drive the overall joint constraint on @xmath52 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : like ] .",
    "the wmap data also serve to fix the parameters that control the high redshift universe . in particular",
    ", it constrains the initial amplitude of power on scales that are observed in galaxy surveys such as the sdss lrg survey .",
    "= 3.3truein      the time - dependent compton wavelength of @xmath0 models induces a more dramatic effect in the matter power spectrum during the acceleration epoch .",
    "in fact , average compton wavelengths down to a few mpc are potentially observable in the linear power spectrum . under this scale ,",
    "the enhanced growth rate leads to excess power relative to the same initial power spectrum determined by the wmap data .",
    "unfortunately the overall change in power is degenerate with the unknown galaxy bias .",
    "however if the compton wavelength appears between the few to 100 mpc scale the distortion of the shape of the power spectrum is potentially distinguishable in current surveys . in our parameterization",
    "this occurs for @xmath53 .",
    "= 3.3truein    the sdss lrg data set in fact favor enhanced power over the _ linear _",

    "the @xmath0 model is in fact a better fit to the shape of the power spectrum , with @xmath56 for this specific choice of bias .",
    "however in the @xmath3cdm model , we expect lrg galaxy clustering to be nonlinear in exactly the region where these changes of shape occur .",
    "in fact a non - linearity parameter of @xmath57 , which represents a reasonable amount of non - linearity , produces an excellent fit to the data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath0 enhancements of small scale power are degenerate with non - linear effects in @xmath3cdm and open up a corresponding degeneracy between @xmath38 and @xmath52 ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : like ] and compare @xmath60 relative to @xmath61 , where the cmb spectra are nearly identical ) .",
    "it is the marginalization over the non - linear parameter @xmath38 and bias which substantially degrades the ability of the lrg data to constrain @xmath0 models .",
    "this is a theoretical and not an observational limitation .",
