    "as spectroscopy provides much more information than photometry alone , spectroscopic observations were also carried out to identify and classify nearby stars .",
    "recent studies dealing with sample sizes larger than 10 objects are cited in table  1 .",
    "all together , they revealed 490 stars in the 25 pc sample and 25 within 10 pc .",
    "however , we note that the samples investigated by the different authors do have many stars in common so that the total number of newly discovered neighbours is much smaller .",

    "in the past years , several classification schemes have been proposed for cool dwarfs .",
    "first , the least - squares minimization technique by @xcite has the advantage of assigning types based on both molecular or atomic features and the slope of the spectrum .",
    "recently , @xcite developed a similar but more accurate method that matches a target spectrum to one from a database of standard spectra ( software program called allstar ) .",
    "@xcite used the minimisation of the absolute differences between target and template spectra in their low - resolution classification spectroscopy .",
    "a different approach was taken by @xcite , who measured the strengths of the prominent tio and cah features of m dwarfs .",
    "they defined several indices being the ratio between the flux within a given spectral feature and the flux in a nearby pseudo - continuum region .    for the latest m dwarfs , @xcite defined an index based on the vo bandstrength , whereas @xcite and @xcite proposed spectral indices for classification down to the l type where tio and vo bands fade due to the condensation of ti and v to dust .",
    "the pseudo - continuum spectral ratios ( namely pc3 ) defined by @xcite covers a narrower wavelength range than for the computation of indices , thus it is less sensitive to possible wavelength shifts .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a unified scheme for the classification of m dwarfs is needed and they defined an enhanced classification based on a set of existing @xcite and new spectral indices that measure the most important features in the optical spectral range .",
    "furthermore , the classification procedure of @xcite allows us to distinguish potential subdwarfs ( sdm ) or extreme subdwarfs ( esdm ) from the m dwarfs .",
    "accordingly , @xcite used a cah2+cah3 versus tio5 diagram to discriminate between the three different object classes .",
    "this diagram was also used by @xcite and @xcite when reporting the discovery of an esdm6.5 and an sdm9.5 star respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the locus of our candidates ( filled circles ) in the cah2+cah3 versus tio5 diagram superimposed with the data used in the same diagram by @xcite and newly discovered objects by @xcite .",
    "most of our candidates lie in the m - dwarfs region , including the 4 stars for which alternative distances were computed assuming that they belong to the thick disc ( see last column in table  2 ) . thus these stars are more distant disc stars instead of nearby low - metallicity dwarfs .",
    "spectral types are obtained by visual comparison with our spectral templates of comparison stars , observed together with our target stars ( table  4 ) . for comparison",
    ", we also derive spectral types , using the classification scheme based on the tio and cah bandstrengths .",
    "we also measured the pseudo - continuum spectral ratio pc3 , useful for late dwarfs , in particular for m7 and m8 stars that are missing in our comparison sequence .",
    "the results are given in table  5 .",
    "the uncertainty of our spectral type determination is 0.5 subclass .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the spectral type determined from the tio5 and pc3 indices versus our adopted spectral type obtained from the comparison with templates . as already pointed out by the different authors who defined the indices , the tio5 index starts to deviate from our spectral sequence for spectral types later than m6 , whereas the pc3 index is not reliable for stars earlier than m3 .",
    "both indices are well in agreement in the overlapping region m3-m6 .",
    "the sdm0 star lhs  29 and lhs  73 are also marked in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the latter could also be a subdwarf given its location in the reduced proper motion versus colour diagram .",
    "its position in the cah2+cah3 versus tio5 diagram is compatible with the position of other known subdwarfs , although dwarfs , subdwarfs and extreme subdwarfs are not well separated in this part of the diagram .    for this star , lhs  73 , we determined the radial velocity .",
    "we compared the position of the potassium line at 769.9 nm , the iron line at 838.8 nm , and the calcium triplet at 849.8 nm , 854.2 nm and 866.2 nm with the position of the same lines in the spectrum of the standard star lhs 1827 with known radial velocity ( 47.2 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "we obtained a radial velocity of 100.6 km s@xmath5 , with an accuracy of 15 km s@xmath5 .",
    "we then computed the galactocentric velocities and found ( @xmath6 ) = ( -0.4 @xmath7 3.8,-207.0 @xmath7 23.3,-141.4 @xmath7 15.2 ) km s@xmath5 , compatible with the space motion of a star belonging to an old population , thick disc or halo .",

    "we derived @xmath10 = 14.4 pc for lhs 1249 and @xmath10 = 13.8 pc for nltt 8435 .",
    "for those objects , we also estimated the distance using the @xmath12 versus @xmath13 theoretical relation for white dwarfs of 0.6 from @xcite and obtained 16.9 pc for lhs 1249 and 14.3 pc for nltt 8435 .",
    "following the conventional number 50  400/@xmath14 to assign a spectral index , we performed black - body fits to the spectra and obtained 6200 k for lhs 1249 and 4800 k for nltt 8435 , with an accuracy of @xmath7 100  k. the derived spectral types are dc8 and dc10 , respectively .",
    "@xcite obtained spectroscopy of nltt 8435 and found it to be a dc white dwarf at 16 pc and with @xmath14 = 5300 @xmath7 200 k.    the lower spectrum shows clear indications of k dwarfs ( mgh , na features ) .",

    "@xcite computed relations between spectral type and absolute magnitude in the @xmath15 band , @xcite in the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 bands .",
    "several calibrations have also been computed in the @xmath0-band :    @xcite determined trigonometric parallaxes for 28 late - type dwarfs and derived a @xmath12(spectral type ) relation valid for types later than m6.5 .",
    "@xcite used a well observed sample of nearby dwarfs with measured trigonometric parallaxes , 2mass @xmath0 magnitude and spectral type to calibrate a spectroscopic parallax relation @xmath12(spectral type ) .",
    "they adopted a fit with several line segments in the spectral type range from k7 to t8 .",
    "@xcite used a sample of 68 late - type dwarfs with well determined trigonometric parallaxes surveyed by the palomar / michigan state university ( pmsu ) survey to derive a @xmath12(tio5 ) relation .",
    "@xcite suplemented these data to fit a fourth - order polynomial @xmath12(spectral type ) relation , valid for types m6 to l8 .",
    "@xcite provided @xmath12 for spectral types over the whole range from k0 to l8 .",
    "@xcite identified in the literature 27 stars with good trigonometric parallaxes and photometry and with known pc3 indices to derive a calibration of absolute magnitudes in the near infrared as a function of the pc3 index .    since the more accurate available photometry of our candidates is in the near infrared bands , we prefer to use spectral type versus near infrared absolute magnitudes relations .",
    "the available @xmath12 against spectral type calibration relations are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] , in the spectral type range where they are valid .",
    "we note that the absolute magnitudes @xmath12 given by most of calibration relations do not differ by more than the differences due to the 0.5 subclass uncertainty in the spectral type .    for types earlier than m3.5 , we computed the mean of the @xmath12 obtained using @xcite and @xcite relations .",
    "for the stars falling in the region m3.5 to m4.5 , where there is a clear discontinuity in the calibrating relations ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion on this jump ) , we averaged the absolute magnitudes obtained from the upper @xcite and lower relations @xcite , as well as the fixed value @xmath12 = 8.34 @xcite . for types m5 to m6",

    "a quite uncertain trigonometric parallax , 37.6 @xmath7 8.9 mas ( 21.5 pc @xmath20 34.8 pc ) can be found for this star in the yale trigonometric parallaxes @xcite .",

    "@xmath11 is a chromospheric activity indicator for m dwarfs .",
    "stars showing a @xmath11 emission line are indicated by the additional letter `` e '' in the spectral type column of table  5 .",
    "although the size of our sample is too small to have a strong statistical sense , we find a correlation between the activity and the spectral type . the number of active stars is greater among late - type stars than early - type stars and is increasing across the spectral type sequence .",
    "none of the stars with spectral type earlier than m3 ( over 14 objects ) shows an @xmath11 emission line , whereas all of our three stars later than m8 show evidence of activity .",
    "24% of the m3.5-m4 stars ( over 21 objects ) , and 47% of the m4.5 to m6 stars ( over 16 objects ) show activity .",

    "nevertheless , it is clear that further efforts are needed in order to reach a much higher completeness level .",
    "the neighbours recovered from our study are mainly m dwarfs .",
    "three are white dwarfs , cooler than 6200  k. one star , apmpm j0541 - 5349 , appeared to be a binary consisting of two m2 stars with an angular separation of 3.33 , at a distance of 53.4 @xmath7 4.1 pc from the sun .",
    "we computed the radial velocity of the subdwarf candidate lhs 73 and found a space motion compatible with that of an object belonging to an old population . with our determined distance of 18.7 pc , lhs 73 is among the few subdwarfs within 20 pc .",
    "furthermore , lhs 73 has a companion , lhs 72 .",
