    "the increasing number of super - massive black hole ( smbh ) candidates discovered in the mid 1990s led to the investigation of smbh demographics .",
    "it was found that various properties of the host bulge correlated with the smbh mass , e.g. bulge luminosity and mass @xcite , stellar velocity dispersion - the @xmath2 relation - @xcite and concentration index @xcite .",
    "scatter in these relations are comparable if enough care is taken in deriving the bulge properties @xcite .",
    "such correlations have fundamental implications for both smbh and host galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "these `` secondary '' methods also present a valuable practical tool to estimate smbh mass .",
    "the `` primary '' methods , used to originally define the relations , determine smbh mass by considering the direct gravitational effects of smbhs .",
    "however , each primary method has a drawback : proper motion studies can only be carried out in the milky way ; @xmath3 masers need to be orientated correctly ; gas kinematics may be influenced by non - gravitational effects and stellar dynamics must be derived from relatively low surface brightnesses .",
    "the advantages of knowing the exact form of the smbh - host relations then become obvious if trying to sample a large number of smbh masses across a wide dichotomy of host types and redshifts .",
    "there still exists a fundamental bias toward large ( @xmath4 ) smbh mass measurements in the relations however .",
    "this stems from the relative ease of mass measurements in giant ellipticals : it is easier to spot a bigger black hole .",
    "the low mass end of the relations ( @xmath5 ) , which essentially represents late type spirals , has yet to be fully populated .",
    "this is unsurprising when considering the difficulties and complexities involved with observing and modelling such systems .",
    "this swing toward high mass smbhs has led some to discuss whether these relations are indeed linear @xcite .",
    "if we are to effectively extrapolate these secondary relations to make conclusions about formation and evolutionary scenarios , and indeed use them as smbh mass estimators , we need to quell any doubts as to their nature .",
    "to this end we have completed a space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) survey of 54 local spirals @xcite using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "this data has been used to make primary smbh mass estimates by modelling the gravitational potential as represented by the central gas kinematics and surface brightness profiles @xcite . however , to populate the low mass end of the secondary estimators we need to establish the bulge properties .",
    "consequently we have initiated integral field spectroscopic observations of the original stis sample .",
    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) is a reliable and highly flexible tool capable of quickly gathering a large amount of dynamical information .",
    "it allows the observation of the full 2d line of sight velocity distributions ( losvds ) .",
    "as there are few published 2d kinematical maps of spiral bulges we present here an atlas of our data so far including radial velocity fields , major axis rotation curves , stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath0 ) fields and aperture integrated velocity dispersions ( curves of growth ) . in",
    "  [ obs+dr ] we outline the observations and basic data reduction , while ",
    "[ losvd ] details how we extracted the 2d losvds .",
    "the data is presented in   [ data ] and briefly summarized and discussed in   [ summary ] .",
    "our observations form the first ifs survey specifically applied to a sample of spiral bulges .",
    "they positively complement the sauron ifs project which is directed at 72 targets including a number of spirals @xcite . from the nature of the @xmath2 relation , and the general character of spiral galaxies , we required instruments capable of resolving @xmath0 well below @xmath6 . for our northern hemisphere targets",
    "this lead us to use the fibre fed integral field unit ( ifu ) integral , on the 4.2 m wht , with the @xmath7 order echelle grating ( @xmath8 ) . whilst the caii triplet is the preferred tracer of stellar dynamics @xcite this grating",
    "could only be centered on the mgb triplet ( @xmath9 ) . observing conditions ensured all nights were non - photometric and forced the use of the sb3 fibre bundle .",
    "this bundle consists of a main @xmath10 array with 115 circular apertures packed according to kepler s conjecture .",
    "the @xmath11 diameter of these apertures ensured that the psf due to seeing ( which was typically @xmath12 ) was under - sampled .",
    "the main array is surrounded by a concentric circle ( @xmath13 ) of 20 apertures designed to sample the sky . for our southern hemisphere targets we used the fibre fed ifu spiral , on the 3.9 m aat , with the r1200 grating ( @xmath14 ) centered on the caii triplet at @xmath15 .",
    "ordinarily spiral consists of 512 apertures but effective sky reduction can be achieved by masking half of the array and using spiral in `` nod and shuffle '' ( ns ) mode .",
    "ns masking of the mitll2a detector meant that 1 row and 1 column of the array fell off the chip .",
    "this reduced the number of usable apertures ( @xmath16 ) to 225 over a @xmath17 area .    during our observing runs priority",
    "was given to targets for which we have successful stis spectra @xcite .",
    "to date we have completed ifs observations on 23 of the original 54 spiral bulges .",
    "calibration frames including flat - fields , tungsten lamp flats , dark frames , bias frames and cu - ne / cu - ar arc frames , along with at least 3 late type ( g , k , m ) spectroscopic standards , were observed throughout each night .",
    "at least 3 target exposures were made in order to facilitate the easy removal of cosmic rays .",
    "we made several offset sky observations , especially when the overheads associated with ns observations lead us to abandon its use in some cases .",
    "the spiral data was reduced using the adapted automatic 2df software developed by jeremy bailey of the anglo - australian observatory .",
    "integral data reduction was carried out with standard iraf routines , and made use of the _ integral _ package developed by robert greimel of the isaac newton group .",
    "detector positions of the individual aperture spectra were traced by fitting a polynomial across the dispersion axis of a high signal lamp flat .",
    "this enabled scattered light to be identified and removed from the science frames .",
    "the trace of the spectra was then used as a master template in extracting the subsequent spectra .",
    "lamp flats were again used to make throughput corrections before carrying out wavelength calibrations .",
    "sky subtraction was performed using ns or by subtracting a collapsed off - set sky frame or summed sky apertures .",
    "all objects had the continuum fitted to each individual spectra . this level was then used together with the aperture spacial positions to create 2d intensity maps ( essentially very low spacial resolution images of the targets ) .",

    "each method makes the fundamental assumption that losvds can be recovered by convolving a broadening function to a shifted template stellar spectra of the same mean spectral type .",
    "we have attempted to use each of these methods on our sample , but only a select few are suited to the nature of our data ( essentially @xmath154 s / n@xmath155 spectra ) .",
    "typical fourier and pixel fitting techniques fail at the levels of s / n present here and require a large amount of time to complete due to the nature of filters and number of possible solutions .",
    "we have seen that the technique of cross correlation , hereafter xcor ( * ? ? ?",
    "* td79 ) , performed well in extracting accurate @xmath156 and @xmath157 order losvd moments from our spectra and is particularly suited to large datasets .",
    "we performed xcor on each spectrum for each observed template by following td79 as implemented in the _ iraf.rvsao _ package . as these reduction steps are considered standard and well established we refer readers wishing to see the detailed treatment of spectra through the cross correlation procedure to @xcite . in brief",
    ", the position of the xcor peak determines the radial velocity shift , whilst the width of the peak is related to the projected stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "each spectrum has any residual emission features suppressed and is continuum subtracted , apodized , zero - padded and binned linearly in @xmath158 space before being passed through the xcor .",
    "quadratic weights are applied to deviations in the continuum subtracted spectra to ensure that stronger lines are more heavily weighted . to limit the size of secondary peaks in the xcor function a cosine bell filter",
    "is applied .",
    "errors in the position and width of the xcor are defined by the `` @xmath159 '' statistic which is calculated by _",
    "rvsao _ and is used as a quality measure of the xcor . if we assume that a perfect xcor is proportional to the broadening function convolved with the auto correlation function ( acf , i.e. , the xcor of a spectrum with itself ) then we expect to see symmetry about the radial velocity . this is because both the broadening function and the acf are themselves symmetrical .",
    "the constant of proportionality between the perfect correlation and the convolved broadening function will be defined by the height of the central peak .",
    "the height of the peak , normalized by the antisymmetric components in the xcor , defines @xmath159 and is used as the aforementioned quality measure of values derived from the xcor itself .    however , these error estimates are insignificant when compared to those introduced by the possibility of template mismatch , low signal spectra and large velocity dispersions .",
    "the advantages of observing a template library now becomes apparent .",
    "for each aperture , after correcting the xcor radial velocities for barycentric and stellar radial velocities , we used the @xmath159 weighted average value between each template for the velocity and width measured in that aperture .",
    "the standard deviation around these weighted values was then used as a separate estimate in the error of each measurement .",
    "more weight was placed on higher @xmath159 values as defined in the following equation :    @xmath160    where @xmath161 is the final velocity or width and @xmath162 and @xmath163 represent the values derived using template 1,2 or 3 .",
    "any of the weighted values that fell outside the equivalent of a @xmath164 clip ( defined by the interquartile range of the data from the entire array ) were flagged as `` discordant '' , the percentage of discordant events per galaxy then being used as a quality measure of the ifs data .    as with the intensity maps ,",
    "the full 2d kinematics were recovered by mapping the derived velocities to the relative spacial positions of each aperture on the ifus .    we have carried out extensive testing of the xcor procedure by creating a composite spectra from the observed templates , generating simulated radial velocity and velocity dispersion fields , introducing a surface brightness profile and adding poisson noise . as the width of the xcor peak",
    "does not give a direct measure of @xmath0 we tested three independent @xmath0 recovery methods : hwhm correction ( @xmath165 ) ; acf correction ( @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the width of the peak and @xmath168 is given by the acf ) and a calibration function correction .",
    "the calibration function , which was determined by fitting a polynomial to the known and measured values of @xmath0 , proved to be far superior in terms of @xmath169 .",
    "as some of our sample are known to contain starbursts and agn we also tested the effects that such objects may have on the xcor . to the composite template spectrum we added increasing proportions of early type spectra and a seyfert 1 spectrum . in both cases we found that 90% contamination was needed in order to significantly affect the @xmath159 statistic ( i.e. , take it below 3 ) .",
    "similar results were also found when introducing large velocity shifts to spectra ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "examples of the xcor are presented in figures  [ fig:4041example ] and [ fig : discord ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:4041example ] shows the cross correlation functions from two apertures in ngc  4041 and overlays of the derived fits onto observed spectra . in both the high signal ( s / n=23 ) and low signal ( s / n=8 ) cases well defined cross correlation functions",
    "can be seen giving confident results .",
    "these figures also demonstrate the nature of the @xmath159 statistic ( the amount of anti - symmetry in the cross correlation function ) .",

    "the derived radial velocity and velocity dispersion data from low discordance and high discordance cases ( ngc  4212 and ngc  3021 respectively ) were placed into discrete bins in velocity space . the distribution of data is shown by plotting the number of measurements to fall within a specific bin .",
    "in spectra down to s / n@xmath171 we are confident that the xcor procedure will return accurate values for the @xmath156 and @xmath157 order losvd moments . however , in many cases the central apertures of the ifu arrays contain s / n",

    "the maximum penalized likelihood , hereafter mpl @xcite , is a non - parametric method in that it places no constraints on the shape of the losvd and allows the recovery of higher order moments ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "it is ideally suited to low s / n as the penalty function introduces significantly less bias than fourier methods when smoothing noise characteristics .",
    "we carried out similar tests as for the xcor and again found that 90% starburst / agn contamination and shifts of @xmath176 were needed to significantly affect the extracted moments .",
    "in order to determine the most appropriate value for the smoothing parameter ( @xmath177 ) we re - performed the mpl for increasing values of @xmath177 until cusps in the higher moments were seen .",
    "a bootstrap , using 100 realizations , was used in order to determine the 68% confidence levels in the derived hermite polynomials .",

    "these observations suggest that @xmath0 - the projected stellar velocity dispersion - is a non - trivial parameter to derive consistently from system to system .    with these considerations in mind",
    "we are left to contemplate the errors in smbh mass estimates derived from the @xmath2 relation .",
    "the data presented here suggests that values of @xmath0 taken from the literature , where little heed has been taken of aperture sizes and the effects of rotation , may demonstrate variations due to their heterogeneous nature .",
    "an attempt to quantify these errors , with respect to aperture size , can be made by calculating @xmath185 , i.e. the mean difference between the extended ( @xmath186 ) and central ( @xmath187 ) values of @xmath0 as determined from xcor .",
    "indeed , if we are to assume that @xmath186 and @xmath187 are a good representation of @xmath0 within @xmath188 and @xmath189 respectively ( @xmath188 being the effective or half - light radius ) , then @xmath185 may also go some way toward explaining the scatter in the @xmath2 relation , especially in the spiral region where the most weighting is given to the slope ( @xmath177 ) .    from the data presented in table  [ tab : results ] we find @xmath190 .",
    "this figure implies that the slope of the @xmath2 relation will be affected by the aperture size used to measure @xmath0 .",
    "it then becomes clear that a formal unambiguous definition of @xmath0 must be made , undoubtedly through the use of integral field spectroscopy where the exact behaviour of @xmath0 can be followed across two dimensions , before a confident estimate of the slope and scatter in the @xmath2 relation can be made .",
    "it must also be noted that carrying this value of @xmath185 through the two forms of the @xmath2 relation , i.e. , @xmath191 @xcite and @xmath192 @xcite using @xmath193 , leads to smbh mass ranges of @xmath194 and @xmath195 respectively .",
    "therefore , in future , authors wishing to use the @xmath2 relation to estimate the masses of smbhs from `` simple '' @xmath0 measurements must pay close attention to the processes used in order to make that estimate of @xmath0 in the first place .",
