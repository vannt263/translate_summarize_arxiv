    "requirement for innovative detection technologies to assist investigators in intelligence gathering prior to or after a radiological or nuclear incident has been identified by canada s chemical , biological , radiological - nuclear and explosives research and technology initiative ( crti ) . to address this need",
    ", we are designing a compton gamma imager .",
    "our design goal is a compact instrument capable of localizing a 10  mci point source of cs-137 40  m away to within a few degrees , in a field of view of @xmath2 in both directions , in under a minute .",
    "there are other groups investigating related imager designs , employing hpge  @xcite , si  @xcite , czt  @xcite , or gaseous time projection chamber  @xcite detector technologies",
    ". these techniques generally provide superior energy- and ultimately image resolution on a per - event basis , to what can be achieved with scintillator materials . on the other hand ,",
    "scintillators provide the benefit of a cost - effective way to produce a high - efficiency detector in a form which can readily be made compact and rugged , for deployment to the field .",
    "this portability constraint also introduces a need for an instrument which has low power consumption , and the cost - effectiveness of scintillator opens the possibility of deployment of more than one unit .",
    "there is an interesting approach to hybrid compton and coded - aperture imaging which also uses an all - scintillator design  @xcite .",
    "spare parts from an all - scintillator space - borne compton telescope have been used to demonstrate a capability at ground level of identifying sources of radiation  @xcite .",
    "there has also been a study indicating that an all - scintillator design could be promising for the detection of highly enriched uranium  @xcite .    here ,",
    "we present design studies conducted using the beamnrc / egsnrc simulation package  @xcite .",
    "this study aims to determine whether our design goal is achievable , and whether some prospective scintillator materials can be ruled out .",
    "this work will proceed toward the development of a prototype .",
    "the process of compton scattering is illustrated in figure  [ fig_diag ] .",
    "an incoming photon of energy @xmath3 scatters from an atomic electron , leading to a final state in which there is an outgoing electron of energy @xmath4 and an outgoing photon of energy @xmath5 .",
    "a sketch of a compton gamma imager is provided in figure  [ fig_schematic ] .",
    "the energy @xmath4 is deposited at some location in a pixellated scatter detector . the outgoing photon escapes the scatter detector to deposit its energy , @xmath5 , at some location in a position - sensitive absorber detector . the scattering angle between the initial and final state photons , @xmath6 ,",
    "can be determined from the two energy deposits , according to , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the electron rest energy .",
    "thus , the position of the source may be reconstructed to lie somewhere on a cone of opening angle @xmath6 with its axis along the line joining the positions of the two energy deposits , and its apex at the first energy deposit . by back - projecting the cones from several events onto an image plane",
    ", an image may be reconstructed from the positions where the cones overlap .",
    "using the beamnrc / egsnrc monte carlo simulation packages we have constructed models of compton gamma imagers .",
    "the models consist of layers of scintillator 20  cm x 20  cm in cross section , with 1  cm thickness in the scatter detector and 0.8  cm thickness in the absorber detector .",
    "four different materials have been tested for the scatter detector , labr@xmath0 , nai , caf@xmath1 and polyvinyltoluene - based plastic scintillator , hereinafter referred to as pvt . in the following , the detector models will be referred to by the scatter detector material .",
    "the number of scatter detector layers is dependent upon the material .    to determine the optimal thickness of the scatter detector for each material",
    ", we looked at the probability for an incoming gamma to compton scatter or to undergo a photo - electric process , as a function of material thickness .",
    "for this study , we have generated 10,000 events from a 662  kev 0.1  mm x 0.1  mm square parallel beam incident at the centre of the front face of a 50  cm x 50  cm x 50  cm cube of material .",
    "the probability for an interaction to occur is presented in figure  [ fig_2 ] as a function of depth within the slab .        for all materials , as the thickness of the material increases , the probability of at least one compton scatter occuring , represented by the solid histogram in figure  [ fig_2 ] , increases .",
    "however , the probability of the photon being absorbed in a photo - electric process , represented by the dotted histogram , increases with thickness as well .",
    "the probability of secondary compton scatters also increases with material thickness ( not shown ) .",
    "this means that there is some thickness at which the probability of exactly one compton scatter is maximized .",
    "this probability is represented in figure  [ fig_2 ] by the dashed histograms .    in the models discussed here ,",
    "we have chosen the material thickness of the scatter detector according to the maximum of the dashed curve in figure  [ fig_2 ] .",
    "thus the labr@xmath0 , nai , caf@xmath1 and pvt scatter detectors feature two , three , four and eight , 1  cm - thick slabs of scintillator , respectively .",
    "there is 2  cm of spacing between the front faces of successive layers of scintillator in the scatter detector .",
    "all of the models feature an absorber detector consisting of five 0.8  cm layers of labr@xmath0 with 1  cm spacing between the front faces of successive layers .",
    "the angular resolution of a compton imager will improve , the farther apart are the energy depositions @xmath4 and @xmath5 . at the same time , at least for these simple designs , the efficiency will worsen the farther apart are @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in order to reduce the differences in performance which are due to these geometrical differences between the different models",
    ", we have chosen to keep the distance between the centre of the scatter detector and the front face of the absorber detector the same for all models .",
    "this distance is 9  cm , leaving air - gaps between the scatter detector and the absorber detector of various sizes for the different models , with the pvt detector having the smallest air - gap at 1  cm .",
    "readout devices for light collection placed between the layers will constitute dead material within the compton imager . to account for this effect we have added a 1  mm - thick layer of sio@xmath1 and a 10  @xmath10m - thick layer of au after each scintillator layer in both the scatter and absorber detectors , to represent arrays of silicon photomultipliers .",
    "to compare the performance of the detectors , we simulated a mono - energetic point - source situated 40  m from the centre of the front face of the models .",
    "we investigated the energy dependence of the detector performance , choosing on - axis point sources of energy 300  kev , 500  kev , 1  mev , 1.5  mev and 2  mev .",
    "we also looked at the performance for a 662  kev source located on - axis and at angles between the detector axis and the line between the centre of the front face and the source position of 10@xmath11 , 20@xmath11 , 30@xmath11 and 40@xmath11 .",
    "we investigated three different sources of image degradation : initial - state electron physics effects , energy resolution effects , and the effect of finite detector segmentation .    * in egsnrc",
    ", binding effects and doppler broadening are treated according to the relativistic impulse approximation  @xcite .",
    "these effects are controlled by an input parameter and may easily be turned on or off .",
    "* smearing of the energy measurement in the scintillator and readout was applied to energy deposits in the nai scatter detector using energy resolutions determined by experiment  @xcite .",
    "for all other materials , the energy deposits @xmath12 were smeared by a gaussian distribution about the true energy deposited , of width @xmath13 , where the constant @xmath14 was determined for labr@xmath0 , caf@xmath1 and pvt by the constraint that the fwhm resolution at 662  kev should come to 2.9% , 10% and 14% respectively quoted by suppliers . note that suppliers do not quote typical energy resolutions at 662  kev for caf@xmath1 and pvt , because for these materials the high compton to photo - electric cross section ratio means that no photopeak for cs-137 may be observed .",
    "we chose the fwhm energy resolutions of caf@xmath1 and pvt based on the energy resolution of nai , and consideration of the number of optical photons produced by these materials relative to nai ( 50% and 25% for caf@xmath1 and pvt , respectively ) .",
    "experiments with quite different geometries from ours have obtained energy resolutions in pvt ranging from 10%  @xcite to 25%  @xcite . of course , these quantities should be determined by experiment , for the particular configuration of scintillator and light - collection device chosen , and this will be the next phase of our detector design program . ] .",
    "to get an idea of the possible effect of underestimation of this parameter , we have simulated an additional pvt detector with a less optimistic fwhm energy resoluton of 25% at 662  kev . *",
    "a segmentation of the detector into 1  @xmath15 pixels was also simulated .",
    "when this effect is on , the energy deposit is assigned a reconstructed position at the centre of the pixel within which it took place .",
    "in addition , attenuation of the signal in air has been simulated by including the air between the source and the detector in the simulation .",
    "we also included an estimate of the effect of naturally occurring radioactive material ( norm ) . to build up a spectrum for norm",
    ", we followed a procedure similar to that outlined in  @xcite .",
    "the norm energy spectrum had two components , a ) `` lines '' - a set of lines representing the seven dominant energies emitted by the isotopes u-238 , k-40 , th-232 and their daughters in equilibrium and b ) `` continuum''- a continuum distribution which is domininant at low energies and monotonically decreasing with energy .",
    "an isotropically emitting sheet of gamma rays with these raw spectra was passed through a simulation of a 4  in  x  4  in  x  16  in nai `` log '' and then compared with data taken with that log in a laboratory .",
    "the comparison with the data was used to adjust the spectrum of the `` continuum '' , and the ratio of `` lines '' to `` continuum '' , until a reasonable representation of the low - energies and of the k-40 , bi-214 and tl-208 peaks was obtained .",
    "an isotropically emitting sheet source with that energy spectrum was then passed through the simulations presented here .",
    "the rate of natural background which we have observed with this log in outdoor trials has ranged from @xmath161000  s@xmath17 to @xmath161600  s@xmath17 . to be conservative in our estimation of the amount of background in this study",
    ", we chose to allow that number of events to enter our model simulations which would correspond to a rate of 2000  s@xmath17 in our nai log .",
    "for 100,000 signal events , that comes to 293,460 norm events .    for events with @xmath18  kev energy deposited in both the scatter and absorber detectors , and no more than one energy deposit in the scatter detector , we examined the spectra of the sum of the energies deposited in the scatter and absorber detectors .",
    "the spectrum obtained with the nai model for the 662  kev source at 20@xmath11 off - axis is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_spectrum_and_arm ]  a ) .",
    "a clear full - energy deposition peak was also observed for the other four detector types , for all energies and angles .",
    "good fits to the peaks with the sum of a gaussian distribution and a straight line distribution were obtained .",
    "the fwhm of the gaussians fit to the full - energy deposition peaks for the six different source energies , for an on - axis source , are presented in table  [ etot_peaks ] as a percentage .",
    "( there is little dependence of this parameter on source angle . )",
    ".fwhm ( % ) of full - energy deposition peak ( kev ) [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     note that the fwhm energy resolutions on the total energy , as presented in table  [ etot_peaks ] , are in some cases considerably better than one would expect from the smearing which has been applied to the energy deposits in the scatter detectors .",
    "this is due to the fact that most of the energy is actually deposited in the absorber detector , so the overall detector energy resolution is dominated by the energy resolution of labr@xmath0 .",
    "we generated 100,000 signal events and 293,460 norm events .",
    "`` golden '' events were defined as those which satisfy :    * @xmath18  kev energy deposited in scatter detector , * @xmath18  kev energy deposited in absorber detector , * no more than one energy deposit in scatter detector , and * total of energies deposited in scatter and absorber detector lying within three standard deviations of the maximum of the full - energy deposition peak .    [ sec_golden ] for each golden event , we assigned the energy in the scatter detector to @xmath19 and the total energy in the absorber detector to @xmath20 .",
    "the position of the energy deposit in the absorber detector was assigned to the position of the maximum energy deposit there .",
    "we then calculated the compton cone opening angle according to equation  [ eqn1 ] , and the angular resolution measure ( arm ) , the distance between the closest approach of the compton cone back - projected onto a sphere , and the true source location .",
    "figure  [ fig_spectrum_and_arm ] b ) shows an arm distribution for a 662  kev point source 20@xmath11 off - axis for the nai model .",
    "the arm distribution is centered on zero degrees .",
    "there is a small pedestal which is largely due to norm .",
    "poorly reconstructructed signal events with escaping energy or misassignment of the first and second scatters also broaden the arm distribution and contribute to the pedestal .",
    "arm distributions for the four other detector models look similar , with the models with poorer energy resolution exhibiting broader arm distributions .",
    "figure  [ fig_arms_vse ] shows the fwhm of the arm distributions for each detector model , for an on - axis point source , for four different source energies .",
    "the degradation of image resolution due to initial - state electron effects , and the effects of energy resolution and position segmentation has been added successively to the simulation .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  [ fig_arms_vse ] show the result of allowing for effects such as back - scattering , which could lead to misassignment of the scatter and absorption occurrences .",
    "no additional source of image degradation is included in the dashed curves .",
    "the dotted curve shows the incremental image degradation due to including a detailed treatment of effects associated with the initial - state electron .",
    "the dash - dotted curve shows the effect of including also the smearing of energies in the scatter and absorber detectors . the solid curve is the final result for each detector .",
    "it shows the arm fwhm after every treated source of image degradation including segmentation of the scatter and absorber detectors into 1  @xmath15 pixels .",
    "this figure illustrates several well - known effects including , a ) doppler broadening affects high - z materials more than low - z materials and b ) both doppler broadening and energy resolution become less of a problem as source energy increases . what is perhaps less well - known is the extent to which the smaller initial - state electron effects of the lower - z materials can compensate for their worse energy resolution .",
    "the arm fwhm values are comparable for all detector models at the higher energies .",
    "figure  [ fig_arms_vse ] also illustrates that the 1  cm segmentation chosen for these simulations is a reasonable value for these designs .",
    "the additional image degradation observed by setting the positions to the pixel centres is similar in magnitude to the other detrimental effects .",
    "the fwhm of the arm distributions are shown in figure  [ fig_arms_vstheta ] for a 662  kev source at various angles with respect to the symmetry axis of the detector .",
    "our specifications call for an instrument with a wide field of view . fig .",
    "[ fig_arms_vstheta ] illustrates that there is very little image degradation for the models studied here , out to angles of @xmath21 .",
    "efficiency is defined as the percentage of those events which were generated in the direction of the front face of the detector , which satisfy the golden selection , and fall within three standard deviations of a gaussian fit to the arm distribution .",
    "efficiencies are shown in figures  [ fig_eff_vse ] and  [ fig_eff_vstheta ] , for an on - axis source of various energies and for a 662  kev source at various source angles , respectively .    ,",
    "nai , caf@xmath1 , and pvt ( @xmath22% ) detectors respectively . to reduce clutter in this plot the curve for pvt ( @xmath23% ) was left out .",
    "it falls between those of caf@xmath1 and pvt ( @xmath22% ) . ]    ,",
    "nai , caf@xmath1 , and pvt ( @xmath22% ) detectors respectively . to reduce clutter in this plot the curve for pvt ( @xmath23% ) was left out .",
    "this curve parallels that of pvt ( @xmath24% ) but is 0.1 to 0.2  % lower . ]    in all of the studied models , the thickness of the scatter detector was chosen to optimize the acceptance of compton events from cs-137 , which emits 662  kev gammas .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that efficiency peaks at intermediate energies for all models .",
    "low efficiency at 300  kev prevents our consideration of these models for compton gamma imaging for sources of energy below 500  kev .",
    "a factor in the low efficiency is the lower energy threshold of 50  kev on the two energy deposits .",
    "this value was chosen as an estimate of a practicable lower level threshold in the final design .",
    "variation of this threshold between 30 and 70  kev has no effect on our conclusions .",
    "with care in the eventual instrument design , it may be possible to recover some events by lowering this threshold .",
    "another stringent requirement is the requirement of exactly one energy deposit in the scatter detector . it should be possible in the future to improve efficiency by reconstructing more of the events which scatter at least twice anywhere in the scatter or absorber detectors .",
    "efficiency is highest for the on - axis source for the low - z detectors .",
    "the efficiency curve as a function of source angle is fairly flat for the detectors based on labr@xmath0 and nai , indicating that the field of view for those designs is good .",
    "the pvt detector requires a lot of material in order to initiate the first compton scatter and this geometric effect leads to the efficiency falling steeply toward the edge of the field of view . with a more clever design for a detector based on pvt , where the absorber detector surrounds the scatter detector , the efficiency could be kept high .",
    "note that these studies based solely on the reconstruction of the compton scattering angles can give a lot of information about relative instrument performance and dependencies on source characteristics , but they do not directly answer the question of what image resolution can be expected in a certain period of time . that is the subject of the next section .      as a final step in the analysis",
    ", the simulated data were passed through a position reconstruction procedure to determine the ability of each detector to locate a point source .",
    "a standard  minimization procedure has been employed to determine the direction vector @xmath25 which best represents the direction from the centre of the front face of the detector to the source . for @xmath26 events ,",
    "the following   function was constructed with two fit parameters , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , representing the polar and azimuthal angles of the source direction vector to be determined : @xmath29 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the angle of closest approach of the direction vector @xmath31 to cone @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the uncertainty on this angle . to simplify the @xmath34 expression , we have approximated the vertices of all cones as lying at the centre of the front face of the detector",
    "would permit measurement of distance . ] . in this approximation ,",
    "the expression for @xmath34 becomes : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the unit - vector axis for cone @xmath32 .",
    "note that @xmath34 reduces to the absolute value of the arm for the situation where @xmath31 points to the true source location .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath34 , too cumbersome to reproduce here , is calculated on an event - by - event basis from the cone - axis uncertainty and the compton opening angle uncertainty ( using equation  [ eqn1 ] ) , taking into account the uncertainties on the energy deposits and their positions .",
    "the effect of doppler broadening is not included in the expression for the uncertainty .",
    "the  expression was minimized using the minuit package  @xcite .    to extract the source direction from a given sample of events ,",
    "four fit iterations are performed , with the direction determined in each iteration passed on as a starting seed direction for the subsequent iteration .",
    "for the first iteration , a preliminary estimate of the source position is deduced from the weighted mean of the cone axis directions , where for weights the squares of the opening angles are used .",
    "all events are included in the minimization procedure . in the second iteration ,",
    "events having a ratio @xmath37 greater than five are excluded from participating in the fit .",
    "this step rejects background events and mis - identified or poorly reconstructed compton events , but gives the fitting procedure ample freedom to find a new solution . in the third iteration",
    ", a rescan of the full set of @xmath26 events is performed , but only those events with @xmath37 less than three are included in the fit .",
    "this provides further rejection of unwanted events , but permits events rejected from the previous iteration , where a less accurate seed direction was used , to return to good standing .",
    "the final iteration is a repeat of the third , again to take into account the more accurate starting seed vector .",
