    "spin transport in semiconductor nanostructures with spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) attracts much attention , stimulated by the interesting spin dynamics in systems with non - conserving spin and possible applications in creating and manipulating spin polarization in nonmagnetic systems by purely electric methods using soi  @xcite .",
    "spin currents are widely studied in the cases where there is a spin hall effect , either intrinsic  @xcite or extrinsic  @xcite .",
    "the basic experimentally observable effect is the spin accumulation near lateral edges of the sample if the electric current is driven along it .",
    "the spin density is accumulated because the transverse spin current does not pass through the edges .",
    "a somewhat different effect appears due to electron scattering on the sample boundary if the particle current flows parallel to it . in this case",
    "a spin polarization is formed near the boundary and the spin density distribution has a rather complicated form  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "another system is studied , in which electrons can pass through the boundary of the soi region .",
    "we consider a 2d system composed of an electron gas with soi and normal ( n ) 2d electron gas without soi , lying in one plane .",
    "this system is designated as soi / n contact .",
    "the main purpose is to find out whether the spin currents , which exist in the soi region due to the coupling between spin and orbital degrees of freedom , penetrate into the n region and how the spin density is distributed there under the non - equilibrium conditions when an electron current flows .",
    "this system is also interesting because it reveals a new aspect of the problem of equilibrium spin currents .",
    "the existence of background spin currents in thermodynamic equilibrium was pointed out by rashba  @xcite for infinite 2d electron gas .",
    "usaj et al  @xcite showed that equilibrium spin current exists also in a bounded 2d electron system with soi , the spin current flowing near the edges of the sample .",
    "the phenomenon of equilibrium spin currents has provoked an intense discussion on the discerning of spin currents and their definition .",
    "the question arose since spin currents in the soi medium are not unambiguously defined  @xcite .",
    "sun et al  @xcite found that the equilibrium spin current exists in a quantum ring even if the soi is absent in some segment . in this connection , of more interest is a system , in which 2d soi medium is in contact with a bulky normal 2d electron gas where the spin current is well defined .",
    "the question is whether the equilibrium spin current exceeds the boundary of the soi medium , entering into the n electron gas and what spin effects appear there .",
    "this question was raised in our previous papers  @xcite .",
    "we have established that the equilibrium spin current does not pass through the boundary , but an equilibrium edge spin current flows near the boundary in both soi and n regions .",
    "its density considerably exceeds the density of the bulk equilibrium spin current .",
    "an important point is that the spin current is well defined in the n electron gas and its definition is beyond doubt . in the present work we study spin effects resulting from the interface scattering under non - equilibrium conditions appearing when an electron current flows in the system .",
    "this question is important since only non - equilibrium transport produces a spin accumulation that can be detected experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the calculations are carried out for a weak deviation from the equilibrium caused by a ballistic electron current flowing normal or parallel to the interface .",
    "the electron current is supposed to be created by a difference of chemical potentials @xmath1 of electrons moving in opposite directions .",
    "two main effects are found .",
    "the electron current parallel to interface leads to the spin accumulation near the interface and changes in the edge spin current .",
    "the accumulated spin density is proportional to @xmath1 , while the augmentation of the edge spin current is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "this means that the non - equilibrium spin current does not depend on the polarity of the electron current . if the electron current is perpendicular to the interface , the edge spin currents vary linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "however , the main effect consists in an appearance of the bulk spin current in n region .",
    "it has two components .",
    "one component is directed parallel to the interface and polarized in the plane perpendicular to it .",
    "the second component is directed normal to the boundary and polarized parallel to it . as a matter of fact , it is a spin hall current caused by the soi / n interface scattering .",
    "both these spin currents penetrate deep into the normal region and have considerable polarization .",
    "consider a 2d soi / n contact . the energy diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "the soi and n regions are located correspondingly at @xmath3 and @xmath4 . to be specific",
    "we suppose that the potential of the soi region is higher than that of the n region .",
    "this arrangement allows one to consider an interesting case where free electrons are present only in the n region , though they penetrate into the soi barrier .",
    "we assume also that the external electric field is too weak to change the equilibrium electron states and the electron current is caused by a non - equilibrium occupation of unperturbed electron states .",
    "such a situation can be realized , for example , if electrons move ballistically and their distribution function is formed by adiabatic contacts , with the applied voltage dropping across the near - contact regions .",

    "these states were in detail described previously  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we only mention that there are three types of states . for @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the characteristic energy of soi , the electron states are evanescent .",
    "they are characterized by the complex wave vector @xmath40 . for @xmath41",
    "all states are either propagating , with real @xmath40 , or entirely decaying , with imaginary @xmath40 .",

    "the electron states have only negative chirality , but there are two kind of states with a given energy .",
    "they differ in the wave vector @xmath40 and for convenience are also labeled by the same index @xmath43 .",
    "of course , all these states are used in calculating the spin density and the currents .    using the wave functions ( [ r ] ) and ( [ l ] ) , we find the spin current density @xmath45 and the spin density @xmath46 for a state @xmath47 , with @xmath48 denoting the right- or left- moving states : @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 labels the spin components , @xmath52 is the velocity .",
    "the total spin current @xmath53 and spin density @xmath54 are found by summing equations  ( [ spincurrent ] ) and ( [ spin ] ) over all states occupied according to the distribution function .    in the presence of a charge current @xmath55",
    ", electrons have an asymmetric momentum distribution function @xmath56 .",
    "we simulate this asymmetry by two semicircles in @xmath57-space with different fermi momenta and , accordingly , with different chemical potentials @xmath58 and @xmath59 for electrons moving in opposite directions .",
    "this distribution function can be realized when electrons move ballistically between two contacts with the potential difference @xmath60 . in what follows",
    "we consider two cases where the electron current is normal or parallel to the boundary .",
    "accordingly , all quantities ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) are labeled by index @xmath64 specifying the direction of the electron current .    as a result",
    "we obtain the following expressions for the spin current and spin density : @xmath65 @xmath66 with @xmath67 the density of states with chirality @xmath20 .    for small @xmath68 the spin current and density",
    "can be expanded in @xmath61 : @xmath69    @xmath70    here the expansion of @xmath53 includes the equilibrium spin current @xmath71 .",
    "a quadratic term is also important because some linear terms are equal to zero . to be exact ,",
    "the linear response of the tangential spin current to the parallel current of particles is absent .",
    "in section 3 we study in detail the response functions of the spin density , @xmath72 , and the spin current , @xmath73 .",
    "they are functions of the coordinate @xmath74 .",
    "the calculations are carried out using the following distribution function : @xmath75    thus , the calculation scheme is the following . first , the matrices of reflection and transmission coefficients , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , are found from equations ( [ r])-([bound_cond ] ) .",
    "then the partial spin current and spin density components , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , are determined using equations ( [ spincurrent ] ) and ( [ spin ] ) . finally , the total spin current and spin density , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , as functions of @xmath74 are obtained from equations ( [ spin_current_x ] ) and ( [ spin_x ] ) using numerical integration .",
    "below , the results of calculations of the spin density and spin currents are presented for two directions of the electron current : normal and parallel to the soi / n interface .",
    "but we begin with recalling the main results concerning the equilibrium spin current .    in unrestricted 2d electron gas with soi the equilibrium spin",
    "current has two nonzero components : @xmath78 , where @xmath79  @xcite . near the soi / n",
    "interface the perpendicular component of the spin current vanishes and it is absent in the n region : @xmath80 .",
    "however , near to the interface there is an edge equilibrium spin current , which flows parallel to the boundary in both regions  @xcite .",
    "the density of this current is considerably higher than the bulk density @xmath81 , since the edge current is proportional to the soi constant @xmath11 , while the bulk spin current is proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "the spin of the edge spin current is polarized in a plane perpendicular to the interface and turns in this plane with increasing distance @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , only two components of the spin current , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , are presented in fig  [ equilibrium_sc ] .     and @xmath85 .",
    "curves 1 and 2 correspond to chemical potentials @xmath86 and @xmath87 , shown in the inset .",
    "calculations were performed for @xmath88 and @xmath33.,width=302 ]    the signs of the spin currents @xmath89 in soi and n regions are seen to be opposite , but the total current is nonzero .",
    "it is interesting that the equilibrium edge spin current exists at @xmath90 , i.e. even if free electrons are absent in the bulk of the soi region .",
    "the current is caused by electrons penetrating under the barrier into the soi region .",
    "on increasing the fermi level above the conduction band bottom in the soi region , @xmath91 , the spin current appears in the bulk of the soi region .",
    "it increases with @xmath5 to reach a limiting value @xmath81 at @xmath92 and then does not change .",
    "in contrast , the edge spin current increases monotonically with @xmath5 , approximately as @xmath93 .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath25 does not affect the results very greatly .",
    "thus , with varying @xmath25 the spin current changes by an amount of the order of @xmath25 .",
    "if the electron current flows parallel to the soi / n interface , the picture of the distribution of edge spin currents changes quite a bit .",
    "the point is that in this case the linear response of the spin current is absent , @xmath94 .",
    "this occurs for the following reason .",
    "the edge spin current is created equally by electrons moving up and down the @xmath37 axis .",
    "if the distribution function @xmath95 is symmetric , the charge currents of the up- and down - moving electrons cancel each other , while the spin currents , in contrast , are summed .",
    "therefore , in the thermodynamic equilibrium the particle current is absent but the edge spin current is nonzero . a small asymmetric variation of the distribution function @xmath96 results in the parallel particle current ( linear in @xmath96 ) , but in the first approximation does not change the spin current .",
    "the variation of the edge spin current is quadratic in @xmath96 .",
    "hence it is proportional to the square of the electron current and in this approximation does not depend on its polarity .",
    "the augmentation of the spin current , caused by the parallel electron current , is described by the factors @xmath97 and @xmath98 in equation  ( [ sc_expansion ] ) .",
    "the calculation shows that these factors decrease with distance from the interface and oscillate with the period @xmath99 .",
    "another stronger effect consists in the spin accumulation near the boundary in both soi and n regions .",
    "the spin density has two nonzero components , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which are proportional to @xmath102 in the first approximation .",
    "the spatial distribution of the spin susceptibility components @xmath103 and @xmath104 is presented in fig .",
    "[ spin_dens_y ] for different positions of the fermi level .     and @xmath104 .",
    "curves 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 correspond to @xmath105 . @xmath88 and @xmath33.,width=302 ]    the spin susceptibility @xmath106 is seen to oscillate and fall to zero with the distance @xmath74 in the n region for all fermi levels . in the soi region , @xmath106 also drops to zero at @xmath107 .",
    "however , at @xmath91 the spin density in the bulk reaches asymptotically a constant value , which is determined by the difference in occupation between electron states with velocities directed along @xmath37 axis and opposite to it .",
    "the spin susceptibility component @xmath108 oscillates with a period @xmath109 and slowly goes to zero with the distance in the bulk of both soi and n regions . as a function of the fermi energy at a given @xmath102 , the spin susceptibilities @xmath103 and @xmath104 increase in the range @xmath90 and",
    "decrease at @xmath110 .",
    "numerical estimation of the spin density accumulated near the boundary in ingaas quantum well for @xmath111 , @xmath112 and the electric current density 1  ma / cm give a value of the order of @xmath113 .",
    "recent experiments have shown that such a value of spin density can be detected by kerr rotation microscopy  @xcite .",
    "the electron current can flow perpendicularly through the interface only if @xmath91 , i.e. when free electrons are present in the bulk of the soi region .",
    "first , note that in the bulk of the soi region there is an equilibrium spin current @xmath114  @xcite flowing normal to the interface , but this current does not pass into the n region  @xcite . in the presence of a non - equilibrium electron current",
    ", this spin current keeps unchanged if @xmath115 , and slightly diminishes proportionally to @xmath116 ^ 2\\ll 1 $ ] otherwise .",
    "thus spin effects in the n region originate solely from the spin - dependent scattering of electrons from the interface .",
    "the main effect is the appearance of the spin current in the n region .",
    "there are two components of the non - equilibrium spin current : normal and tangential .",
    "the spin current component directed normally and polarized in @xmath37 direction , @xmath117 , arises in both soi and n regions as a result of the interface scattering .",

    "in contrast , in the n region the spin current does not depend on the distance , since the spin is a conserved quantity there .",
    "the spin density is constant as well .",
    "the spin polarization ( defined as @xmath120 ) depends on the chemical potential reaching a maximum ( about 50% ) when @xmath5 lies close to the conduction band bottom in the soi region .     for different polarities of the electron current .",

    "this is a transverse spin current effect .",
    "the dependence of the transversal currents on the distance is shown in fig .",
    "[ sc_tang ] for opposed polarities of the electron current .",
    "changes of the transverse spin current in the n region under the action of an electron current @xmath127 are , of course , a manifestation of the spin hall effect caused by the spin - dependent scattering from the interface .",

    "consider an unpolarized electron flow falling on the interface from the n region . during the scattering",
    "the electrons partially penetrate into the soi region where an effective magnetic field forces their spin to precess . in the case of the rashba soi , this field is perpendicular to the wave vector and lies in the plane . as a result of the spin precession , the spin polarization of reflected electrons changes .",
    "spin components @xmath128 and @xmath129 of electrons with equal @xmath40 but opposite @xmath130 turn out to be of opposite sign and cancel each other . therefore under the equilibrium conditions the spin density is absent , but the edge spin current exists since the partial spin currents of electrons with opposed @xmath130 are summed up .",
    "however , in the bulk of the n region , the spin current is absent because the spin currents of electrons with opposed @xmath40 cancel each other . this compensation is disturbed when an electron current flows through the interface resulting in the net total spin current in the bulk .    the fact that this current exists in the n region far away from the interface , where no soi is present , is caused by the infinite size of the interface scatterer in the @xmath37 direction .",
