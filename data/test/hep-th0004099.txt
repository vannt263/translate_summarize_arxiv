    "the massive thirring model ( mtm ) and sine - gordon model ( sgm ) are important as a testing laboratory for understanding ideas proposed for other more complicated field theories .    in this paper",
    "we propose to calculate certain physical quantities for the mtm by performing an explicit diagonalization of its lattice regularization with the @xmath0 spin chain . as the first task we want to calculate the masses of breathers .",
    "the previous calculations have been based on the semiclassical method @xcite , on factorized scattering theory @xcite , or on the bethe ansatz method @xcite .",
    "the additional interest in avoiding the previously mentioned assumptions is due to recent criticism @xcite [ the authors claim that there is only one breather in the whole attractive region , and with different mass than the dashen - hasslacher - neveu ( dhn ) formula predicts ] . the same authors challange also the well - known duality relation between the mtm and sgm @xcite .",
    "the precise meaning and extent of this equivalence was formulated by klassen and melzer @xcite ( notice that the models are not equivalent when they have a finite size in space ) .",
    "one important criticism relates to the use of the so - called string conjecture .",
    "indeed , violations of this conjecture are observed in the literature @xcite . despite the fact",
    "that , at least untill now , it was not known that these violations affect any relevant results , it would be desirable to have a calculation which does not rely on the string conjecture .",
    "it is for this reason that we want to treat the mtm without using the above - mentioned assumptions .",
    "our approach will be based on direct numerical diagonalization of the @xmath0 spin chain which is a lattice regularization of the mtm @xcite .",
    "this method is suited for analyses of low discrete states in the spectrum , but becomes less and less effective when we go to higher states .",
    "such an approach was used in the literature for other problems , e.g. , conformal unitary models perturbed by some relevant operator @xcite .",
    "we also intend to calculate conformal dimensions of operators creating breather states .",
    "there are conjectured values for them @xcite . by explicit calculation",
    "we confirm this conjecture for the first breather but get different results for the second breather .    recently @xcite we have performed a similar calculation for the sgm .",
    "the regularization in this case was the @xmath2 spin chain in a transverse field .",
    "the results on the masses of breathers and conformal dimensions agree as statements on relation of two models would suggest , so it maybe considered also as an independent check of the sgm - mtm correspondence @xcite .",
    "the mtm is a @xmath3-dimensional field theory of a dirac spinor field @xmath4 , defined classically by the lagrangian @xmath5 here @xmath6 is a dimensionful parameter which sets the mass scale in a theory which is conformaly invariant when @xmath7 .",
    "however , although @xmath6 enters eq .",
    "( [ lmt ] ) as a ( bare ) mass , its mass dimension @xmath8 is not equal to 1 but is determined from the ( nontrivial ) anomalous dimension of the field @xmath9 .",
    "the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath10 is scale invariant ( vanishing beta function ) , but it is not uniquely defined due to the existence of different regularizations of the ( conserved ) current @xmath11 .",
    "correspondingly , there is at least a one - parameter family of definitions of @xmath10",
    ". our definition will be the same as the one used by coleman @xcite ( schwinger definition ) .",
    "we shall find it more convenient to use the parameter @xmath12 related to @xmath10 with @xmath13 here @xmath12 is the dimensionless coupling constant from the dually related sgm .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the mtm can be viewed as a perturbed conformal field theory ( cft ) when the second term in eq .",
    "( [ lmt ] ) is treated as a ( massive ) perturbation .",
    "we will now repeat here some results of their analyses relevant for our discussion .",
    "an unperturbed theory @xmath7 ( approached in the uv limit ) is the thirring model which is a cft with central charge @xmath14 and an operator algebra generated by @xmath15 where @xmath16 are primary fields with conformal dimensions @xmath17 where we used duality relation ( [ dua ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ cod ] ) we can read off the scaling dimensions and ( lorentz ) spin of @xmath18 : @xmath19 a whole operator algebra is generated by a quartet of fields @xmath20 , which are connected to the fundamental spinor fields @xmath4 , @xmath21 by @xmath22 now one supposes that hilbert space of the full ( perturbed ) theory is isomorphic to that of the unperturbed one . from operator product algebra ( opa )",
    "it follows that the ( properly normalized ) perturbing operator in the mtm ( [ lmt ] ) is @xmath23 which means that @xmath6 has mass dimension @xmath24 . from the condition of relevancy of the perturbation ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath25 , we obtain coleman s bound @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) . also , from eqs .",
    "( [ lfg ] ) and ( [ pop ] ) we can see that the mtm has a @xmath28 internal symmetry group .",
    "the @xmath29 acts as @xmath30 , while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are generated by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "it was argued a while ago @xcite that the mtm on a cylinder with proper ( antiperiodic ) boundary conditions ( b.c.s ) possesses spin chain regularization given by the @xmath0 spin chain defined by the hamiltonian @xmath35 where @xmath36 are pauli matrices , @xmath37 is an even integer , and @xmath38 is the hamiltonian of the @xmath2 spin chain : @xmath39 where @xmath40 [ we also use standard parametrization @xmath41 , so @xmath42 . in eqs .",
    "( [ xyz ] ) and ( [ xxz ] ) sector - dependent b.c.s should be used : @xmath43 where @xmath44 from results of ref .",
    "it @xcite follows that the @xmath2 chain ( [ xxz ] ) with b.c .",
    "( [ boc ] ) gives in the continuum limit a cft with a space of states equal to that of @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ lfg ] ) , where @xmath46 that leads us to the conjecture that , aside from irrelevant corrections , @xmath47 in the continuum limit .",
    "now , the continuum limit is obtained letting @xmath48 and @xmath49 , but at the same time keeping fixed the scaling parameter @xmath50 : @xmath51 in this limit , the mass gaps of the @xmath0 chain are expected to satisfy a scaling law @xmath52 the scaling parameter @xmath50 is connected to @xmath53 ( space extension of continuum theory , i.e. , mtm ) . for our purposes",
    "it is enough to know that @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) corresponds to @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , respectively .",
    "our goal here is to calculate the mass ratios of particles in the mtm in the @xmath56 limit using the connection with the @xmath0 spin chain ( [ xyz ] ) .",
    "first we must numerically calculate the mass gaps of the spin chain for finite @xmath37 and @xmath58 .",
    "then we must make a continuum limit , i.e. , take @xmath48 and @xmath49 , keeping @xmath50 fixed .",
    "finally we should make a @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath54 , limit . in practice ,",
    "it is preferable to do the following @xcite : first take @xmath48 with @xmath58 fixed and afterwards extrapolate @xmath49 .",
    "a difference is that in the latter case one does @xmath54 before @xmath49 .",
    "these limits are performed using the bst extrapolation method @xcite .",
    "we numerically diagonalized hamiltonian ( [ xyz ] ) for up to 16 sites using the lanczos algorithm .",
    "we are interested in the masses , so we only need the zero - momentum sector .",
    "we should note here that in ref . @xcite it was shown that true space translations are generated not by an ordinary translation operator on the spin chain , but by its square . from this and the fact that hamiltonian ( 3.1 ) commutes with the operator @xmath59 , eq .",
    "( 3.4 ) , it follows that we can break the hamiltonian in the momentum - zero sector into four sectors named @xmath60 , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is macroscopic momentum and @xmath63 denotes eigenvalue of @xmath64 ( which can only be @xmath65 because @xmath66 ) .",
    "we considered a number of values of coupling constant in the attractive regime ( @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 ) .",
    "the structure of the spectrum is in agreement with the dhn prediction , i.e. , we obtain : vacuum , first breather ( @xmath69 ) , second breather ( @xmath70 ) ( when it exists ) , and `` continuum '' in @xmath71 ; fermion ( @xmath72 ) and `` continuum '' in @xmath73 ; antifermion ( @xmath74 ) and `` continuum '' in @xmath75 ; `` continuum '' starting with @xmath76 and @xmath77 in @xmath78 .",
    "names for the particle states and @xmath76 , @xmath77 continuum will be confirmed by results for the mass ratios .",
    "but even we could nt make an extrapolation ( because of the poor scaling in the @xmath79 limit ) for the lowest `` continuum '' state in @xmath71 for values of @xmath10 where the dhn formula predicts that it should be of @xmath80 type , its scaling law in the @xmath81 limit clearly shows that its scaling dimension is the one we expect for the @xmath80 lowest continuum state , i.e. , @xmath82 .",
    "we should mention also that spectra in @xmath73 and @xmath75 are exactly degenerated which means that the @xmath72 and @xmath74 mass gaps are equal even on the lattice , which was not the case in similar analyses of the sgm in @xcite .    in figs",
    "[ mg3][mg75 ] we present numerical results for the scaled gaps @xmath83 for four states : fermion ( @xmath72 ) , first breather ( @xmath69 ) , second breather ( @xmath70 ) , and lowest state in the @xmath76 continuum ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this is of course a check of the scaling relation ( [ mgs ] ) .",
    "finally , partially extrapolated mass ratios @xmath84 and fully extrapolated mass ratios of the first breather @xmath85 are given in tables .",
    "[ r3][r9 ] , together with the dhn predictions @xcite and predictions of fujita _ et al_. @xcite",
    ". final extrapolation @xmath49 was possible only for the first breather because scaling of the second breather is worse and asks for a larger @xmath37 ( probably @xmath86 ) .",
    "one can see that our results strongly confirm dhn and reject fujita _",
    "let us now turn our attention to the opposite , i.e. , uv , limit of our results for the @xmath0 spin chain .",
    "we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : chain ] that it obtained when @xmath55 . from conformal perturbation theory",
    "we expect the scaling relation @xmath87 , \\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the scaling dimension of the state @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is a well - known normalization factor , @xmath91 from eq .",
    "( [ tmch ] ) we can obtain the scaling dimensions of the particle states @xmath72 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 from the condition that @xmath92 should be less singular than @xmath93 .",
    "our results are given in table [ our ] .",
    "they differ from those conjectured in @xcite only for the second breather , which has scaling dimension equal to that of the first breather .",
    "these results are in agreement with those in @xcite for the sgm .",
    "this result for the scaling dimension of the second breather was analyticaly confirmed in @xcite using an extension of nonlinear integral equation method ( nlie ) . in figs .",
    "[ mh3][mh75 ] we show the numeric results for reduced scaling functions , where we used values from table [ our ] for the scaling dimensions .",
    "we have calculated in this paper the masses of breather states and the anomalous dimensions of related operators for the mtm using spin chain regularization .",
    "this is a direct numerical calculation independent of assumptions such as the semiclassical approximation @xcite , factorized scattering theory @xcite , or bethe ansatz method @xcite . on the other hand , in a series of papers based on numerical calculation within the bethe ansatz method @xcite or using the infinite momentum frame technique @xcite ,",
    "different results have been claimed .",
    "our calculation confirms the conventional spectrum .",
    "in addition we calculate the anomalous dimensions of operators creating breather states .",
    "it agrees with conjecture in @xcite for the first breather but disagrees for the second breather .",
    "this result is consistent with the previous calculation for the sine - gordon model , i.e. , consistent with equivalence relation between the two models @xcite .",
