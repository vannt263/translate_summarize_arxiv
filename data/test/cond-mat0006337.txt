    "during the past two decades much attention has been devoted to the study of disordered bulk metals with electron - electron interactions  @xcite from the one hand and arrays of normal metallic grains connected by tunnel junctions  @xcite from the other .",
    "the coulomb interaction plays a very important role in both types of system and many non - trivial physical effects occur due to it . in disordered metals , _ e.g. _ , the coulomb interaction results in quantum corrections to conductivity and reduces the density of states , a phenomenon known as zero bias anomaly .",
    "qualitatively similar effects were predicted  @xcite and studied experimentally  @xcite for arrays of tunnel junctions in the normal state , where a sufficiently strong coulomb interaction can suppress the conductivity ( coulomb blockade of tunneling ) .    in spite of the similarities in the physical behavior of disordered metals and normal arrays of tunnel junctions ,",
    "completely different approaches are used for the theoretical description of these respective systems . as concerns disordered metals with interaction , either diagrammatic methods  @xcite or non - linear @xmath0-models @xcite are employed .",
    "the starting point of these theories is a model of a weakly disordered bulk metal . on the other hand , for the description of coulomb blockade effects in a junction array or a granular material , a completely different approach based on the theory of ambegaokar , eckern and schn ( aes )  @xcite",
    "is commonly used .",
    "the free energy functional proposed by aes does not contain any disorder : the finite conductance obtained within this model is due to tunneling of electrons between grains and can be incorporated into the theory through a term describing the so - called quantum dissipation , first introduced phenomenologically in ref .  .",
    "although both approaches have been introduced almost 20 years ago , only a few indirect attempts have been made to reconcile them .",
    "we mention the work by nazarov  @xcite and levitov and shytov  @xcite that treat the diffusive zero bias anomaly and the coulomb blockade of tunneling on the same footing .",
    "more recently , nazarov  @xcite showed how coulomb blockade phenomena survive in diffusive systems .",
    "indeed , the properties of a granular metal without electron - electron interactions are qualitatively similar to those of a disordered bulk metal ( see e.g. ref .  ) and it would be natural to expect that this qualitative similarity persists even in the presence of interactions .",
    "in fact , one may conjecture that bulk disordered metals from the one hand , and granular metals or arrays of tunnel junctions from the other , can be described within one unifying scheme .    in order to develop such a scheme , we consider in this paper a granular normal metal with coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "the consideration is simplified by taking into account only the long range part of the interaction that leads to coulomb blockade effects .",
    "we assume that the macroscopic dimensionless conductance @xmath1 of the granular metal is large , which enables us to develop a perturbative theory with @xmath2 as the small parameter . within this theory ,",
    "physical quantities of interest can be calculated at arbitrary temperatures .",
    "the diagrammatic analysis is supplemented by the derivation of a @xmath3-model that can be considerably simplified provided one does not take into account weak localization effects .",
    "we demonstrate below that granular metals and networks of tunnel junctions can always be described using the standard techniques developed in the theory of disordered metals ( expansions in cooperons and diffusons , @xmath3- model calculations ) . with the help of these techniques",
    "one can in principle calculate any physical quantity without using the notion of quantum dissipation .",
    "disorder is inevitably present in the system even if electrons move ballistically within the grains . in the latter case",
    "any small irregularity in the shape of the grains causes the electron motion within the grains to be chaotic and this assumption is sufficient for our theory to be applicable .",
    "an integrable shape of the grains does not seem to be realistic , and even if it happened for isolated grains , tunneling from grain to grain would add an additional chaoticity .",
    "these ideas about intrinsic disorder in granular metals have been used in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "we find that , at not too low a temperature , the aes free energy functional gives correct results .",
    "however in the limit @xmath4 aes theory is no longer applicable .",
    "the region of validity of the aes free energy functional is determined by the inequality @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the mean level spacing , @xmath7 is the density of states at the fermi surface and @xmath8 is the volume of a single grain .",
    "we conclude in particular that the aes notion of quantum dissipation at @xmath9 can only be applied to tunnel junctions connecting infinitely large conductors .",
    "if the volume of the conductors is finite the aes picture can be applied at finite temperatures only .",
    "apparently , the notion of quantum dissipation should be treated with care .",
    "a qualitative discussion of the problem `` dissipation versus dynamical screening '' in the case of superconducting grains can be found in a recent lecture by altshuler@xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ choice ] we formulate the model and write physical quantities in terms of functional integrals over anticommuting fields .",
    "we decouple the coulomb interaction by an integration over auxiliary fields . in sec .",

    "[ metal ] we develop a diagrammatic technique .",
    "we show what kind of diagrams correspond to the aes action and demonstrate that , at low temperatures , additional contributions arise . summing up these additional diagrams we arrive at expressions corresponding to the dynamically screened coulomb interaction of a normal metal .",
    "[ sigma ] contains a derivation of a new action for a granular metal with electron - electron interaction which is applicable at arbitrary temperatures .",
    "the results are compared with the results obtained diagrammatically and with those obtained on the basis of the aes action .",
    "our results are summarized in the conclusion .",
    "we consider an array of normal metallic grains coupled to each other .",
    "the dimensionality of the array may be arbitrary .",
    "the grains are assumed to contain imperfections : there can be impurities inside them as well as on their surface .",
    "this implies that the electron motion in the grains is chaotic .",

    "in this paper we constructed a theoretical framework to describe electronic transport in arrays of tunnel junctions or granular metals , in the limit of large inter - granule conductance , @xmath106 .",
    "both disorder and the electron - electron interaction were taken into account .",
    "the prime objective of this enterprise was to unify two large , and seemingly non - overlapping theories of interacting metallic compounds : the aes approach , focusing on charging phenomena in individual grains and their impact on large scale transport behaviour , and the finkelstein theory of disordered interacting metals with its emphasis on the interplay interaction / disorder .",
    "the key to the reconciliation of these two approaches was to observe that for low enough temperatures , @xmath217 , the effective action underlying the aes theory becomes incomplete .",
    "the physical reason is that for low temperatures the electrons and holes participating in the tunneling processes between individual grains maintain their quantum phase memory for a long time , largely in excess of the average tunneling time .",
    "this means that the particle tunneling is not only accompanied by charging and dissipation ( as in the aes approach ) , but also by other , more long ranged physical processes .",
    "specifically , we identified the quantum dissipation contained in the aes action as the high temperature limit of the long ranged screened electron - electron interaction , an observation first made in@xcite .",
    "we re - emphasize that these phenomena were not bound to the presence of a significant disorder concentration ; indeed , none of the results discussed above , displayed dependence on some disorder concentration. the only thing that mattered was chaoticity of the electron motion on scales set by the phase coherence length , a condition that is practically always met in real life systems .    technically , two different routes for including these processes into the theory were proposed .",
    "one consisted of the perturbative summation of diagram classes associated to multiple chaotic scattering . the other , based on an effective action formulation , indentified what is missing in the aes action . remarkably , this second approach readily led to a unification of the aes approach and the finkelstein nonlinear @xmath211-model for weakly disorderd interacting metals . with the benefit of hindsight ,",
    "this fact is easy to understand : it is a well known fact in mesoscopic physics , that the long processes resulting from multiple scattering can be interpreted as a certain type of goldstone modes . within an effective action approach",
    ", these modes must be described by an own degree of freedom , the @xmath168-matrices of the nonlinear @xmath211-model .",
    "thus it is no surprise that we obtained an action of the type ( [ full5 ] - [ full8 ] ) , involving @xmath168-fields and the coulomb phase fields of the aes approach , as an effective description of the low energy phase of the system . for large temperatures ,",
    "the fluctuations of the @xmath168-matrices became inessential and the aes action was retrieved . in contrast , the continuum limit of this action was identified as the finkelstein model and the @xmath168-matrices smoothly integrated into the aes approach , without leading to conceptual complications .",
    "let us make some remarks on potential experimental ramifications of our findings .",
    "it has been predicted in refs .   that two - dimensional normal arrays of tunnel junctions should undergo a kosterlitz - thouless - berezinskii ( ktb ) phase transition at a temperature @xmath218 of the order of the charging energy @xmath208 . at low temperatures , @xmath219",
    ", the array should be in an insulating state ( coulomb blockade ) , whereas for @xmath220 the array is conducting .",
    "in particular , at @xmath221 , the conductivity @xmath211 of the array is predicted to increase with temperature according to a square - root cusp dependence , @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is a constant of order unity .",
    "the experiments  @xcite mentioned in the introduction searched for this ktb transition . in view of our results ,",
    "the applicability of the ktb scenario should be governed by the parameter @xmath224 .",
    "the experiments of refs . were done on arrays with relatively large grains , such that @xmath225 .",
    "indeed , the results obtained in refs .   were in agreement with the ktb scenario . however , ref .",
    "found thermally activated behavior of @xmath226 , rather than the predicted square root cusp dependence on temperature . on the other hand , the experiment by yamada _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite was done on arrays consisting of relatively small cu grains with a size of about @xmath227 , such that @xmath228 .",
    "clearly this is beyond the range of applicability of refs . and the ktb scenario should be treated with care in this case .",
    "remarkably , ref .   concludes good agreement of the results with the theory  @xcite .",
    "given these discrepancies , we conclude that a careful analysis of the temperature - dependent conductivity of junction arrays in the framework of the theory presented in this paper would be of interest .",
