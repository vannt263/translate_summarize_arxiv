    "with the discovery of the standard model ( sm ) higgs - like scalar at the lhc @xcite , the sm particle content seems complete . in particular , the mass and couplings of the neutral higgs boson seem to disfavor an additional chiral generation of quarks and leptons @xcite .",
    "however , additional vector - like fermions , in which an sm generation is paired with another one of opposite chirality , and with identical couplings , are less constrained , as there is no quadratic contribution to their masses .",
    "these states appear as natural extensions of the sm particle content , in theories with warped or universal extra dimensions , as kaluza - klein excitations of the bulk field @xcite , in non - minimal supersymmetric extensions of the sm @xcite , in composite higgs models @xcite , in little higgs model @xcite and in gauged flavor groups @xcite .",
    "vector fermions have identical left- and right - handed couplings and can have masses which are not related to their couplings to the higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "depending on the dominant decay mode , the limits on new vector - like fermions range from @xmath2 gev @xcite , rendering them observable at the lhc .",
    "vector quarks can modify both the production and decays of the higgs boson at the lhc , while vector leptons do not carry @xmath3 charge and can only modify the decay patterns of the higgs .",
    "study of the latter would be a sensitive probe for new physics .",
    "the lepton states contribute to self - energy diagrams for electroweak gauge boson masses and precision observables , and consistent limits on their masses and mixings have been obtained @xcite .",
    "vector leptons have been studied in the context of the sm @xcite , but less so for models beyond the sm , where they can also significantly alter the phenomenology of the model . in the sm ,",
    "introducing heavy fermions provides a contribution of the same magnitude and sign to the one of the top quark and interferes destructively with the dominant @xmath4-contribution , reducing the @xmath5 rate with respect to its sm value .",
    "recent studies indicate that cancellations between scalar and fermionic contributions allow a wide range of yukawa and mass mixings among vector states @xcite .",
    "an investigation of vector leptons in the two higgs doublet model @xcite showed that the presence of additional higgs bosons alleviates electroweak precision constraints .",
    "introducing vector leptons into supersymmetry @xcite can improve vacuum stability and enhance the di - photon rate by as much as 50% , while keeping new particle masses above 100 gev and preserving vacuum stability conditions .",
    "in the present work , we investigate vector leptons in the context of the higgs triplet model ( htm ) .",
    "we do not deal with lhc phenomenology ( pair production and decay ) of the extra leptons , which has been discussed extensively in the literature @xcite , choosing instead to focus on signature features of this model .",
    "we have previously shown that in the higgs triplet model , enhancement of the @xmath6 rate is possible only for the case where the doublet and triplet neutral higgs fields mix considerably @xcite .",
    "we extend our analysis to include additional vector - like leptons in the model and investigate how these affect the higgs di - photon decay rate , with or without significant mixing in the neutral higgs sector .",
    "originally , both cms and atlas experiments at lhc observed an enhancement of the higgs di - photon rate , while the di - boson rates ( @xmath7 ) have been roughly consistent with sm expectations . at present",
    "cms observes @xmath8 times the sm rate , while atlas observes @xmath9 times the sm rate @xcite .",
    "given these numbers , it is possible that either the sm value will be proven correct , or a modest enhancement will persist .",
    "a further test of the sm is the correlation of the decay @xmath1 with one for @xmath10 .",
    "we also include the prediction for the vector lepton effect on branching ratio of @xmath1 and comment on the relationship with the di - photon decay .",
    "we have an additional reason to investigate the effects of vector leptons in the higgs triplet model .",
    "the model includes doubly - charged higgs bosons , predicted by most models to be light .",
    "being pair - produced , the doubly - charged higgs bosons are assumed to decay into a pair of leptons with the same electric charge , through majorana - type interactions @xcite . assuming a branching fraction of 100% decays into leptons , _",
    "i.e. _ , neglecting possible decays into @xmath4-boson pairs , the doubly - charged higgs mass has been constrained to be larger than about 450 gev , or more , depending on the decay channel . however ,",
    "if the vector leptons are light enough , which they can be , the doubly - charged higgs bosons can decay into them and thus evade the present collider bounds on their masses .",
    "we investigate this possibility in the second part of this work .",
    "our work is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the higgs triplet model with vector leptons in section [ sec : model ] . in section [ sec : neutral ] we analyze the effect of the vector leptons on the decays of the neutral higgs bosons , and discuss the constraints on the parameter space coming from requiring agreement with present lhc data .",
    "we include both loop - dominated decays , @xmath0 in [ subsec : gamgam ] , and @xmath11 in [ subsec : zgam ] . in section [ sec :",
    "doublycharged ] we analyze the effect of the vector leptons on the production and decay mechanisms of the doubly - charged higgs at the lhc .",
    "we summarize our findings and conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the electroweak gauge symmetry is broken by the vevs of the neutral components of the doublet and triplet higgs fields , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the doublet higgs field and the triplet higgs field , with @xmath44 ( 246 gev)@xmath45 .",
    "higgs masses and coupling constants in the presence of non - trivial mixing in the neutral sector have been obtained previously @xcite .",
    "one can invoke new symmetries to restrict the interaction of the vector leptons with each other , or with the ordinary leptons , or disallow the presence of bare mass terms in the lagrangian .",
    "for instance ,    1 .   if an additional @xmath46 symmetry under which the primed , double primed and the ordinary leptons have different charges , this would forbid explicit masses @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the lagrangian",
    ". vector leptons would get masses only through couplings to the higgs doublet fields @xcite .",
    "2 .   if one imposes a symmetry under which all the new @xmath51 singlet fields are odd , while the new @xmath51 doublets are even , this forces all yukawa couplings involving new leptons to vanish , @xmath52 , and the masses arise only from explicit terms in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "3 .   finally one can impose a new parity symmetry which disallows mixing between the ordinary leptons and the new vector lepton fields , under which all the new fields are odd , while the ordinary leptons are even @xcite , i.e. , such that @xmath53 ; alternatively one might choose these couplings to be very small .    in this analysis the focus will be on higgs decays .",
    "we investigate the model subjected to symmetry conditions 1 and/or 2 ; and we neglect mixing between the ordinary and the new vector leptons . when allowed , stringent constraints exist on the masses and couplings with ordinary leptons .",
    "new vector leptons are ruled out when they mediate flavor - changing neutral currents processes , generate sm neutrino masses or contribute to neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "recent studies of models which allow mixing between the ordinary leptons and the new ones exist @xcite , but there restrictions from lepton - flavor violating decays force the new leptons to be very heavy @xmath54 tev , or reduces the branching ratio for @xmath55 and of @xmath0 decay to 30 - 40% of the sm prediction , neither desirable features for our purpose here . in the higgs triplet model ,",
    "distinguishing signals would be provided by lighter vector leptons . since imposing no mixing between ordinary and new leptons",
    "allows new lepton masses to be as light as @xmath56 gev , perhaps without a reduction in the higgs di - photon branching ratio , we investigate this scenario here .    in the charged sector ,",
    "the @xmath57 mass matrix @xmath58 is defined as @xcite @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 , with @xmath62 the vev of the neutral component of the higgs doublet .",

    "the presence of the vector leptons affects the loop - dominated decays of the neutral higgs , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and possible relationships between them . in the higgs triplet model , singly- and",
    "doubly - charged bosons also enter in the loops , creating a different dynamic than in the sm .",
    "we analyze these decays in turn , and look for possible correlations between them .",
