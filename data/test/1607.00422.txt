    "the appearance of cluster states in atomic nuclei is an ubiquitous phenomenon with many implications for both nuclear physics and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "while several factors are known to contribute to clustering , a comprehensive microscopic understanding of this phenomenon still remains elusive .",
    "cluster configurations can be energetically favorable due to the large binding energy per nucleon in constituent clusters , such as @xmath0 particles .",
    "the binding - energy argument has often been used to explain properties of @xmath0-conjugate nuclei @xcite , cluster emission @xcite and fission @xcite , and the appearance of a gas of light clusters in low - density nuclear matter @xcite and in the interior region of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "another important factor is the coupling to decay channels ; this explains @xcite the very occurrence of cluster states at low excitation energies around cluster - decay thresholds @xcite .",
    "the microscopic description of cluster states requires the use of an advanced many - body , open - system framework @xcite employing realistic interactions , and there has been significant progress in this area @xcite . for a global characterization of cluster states in light and heavy nuclei ,",
    "a good starting point is density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite based on a realistic nuclear energy density functional , or its self - consistent mean - field variant with density - dependent effective interactions @xcite . within dft",
    ", cluster states have a simple interpretation in terms of quasimolecular states .",
    "since the mean - field approach is rooted in the variational principle , the binding - energy argument favors clustering in certain configurations characterized by large shell effects of constituent fragments @xcite ; the characteristics of cluster states can be indeed traced back to both the symmetries and geometry of the nuclear mean - field @xcite .",
    "the degree of clustering in nuclei is difficult to assess quantitatively in dft as the single particle ( s.p . )",
    "wave functions are spread throughout the nuclear volume ; hence , the resulting nucleonic distributions are rather crude indicators of cluster structures as their behavior in the nuclear interior is fairly uniform . therefore ,",
    "in this study , we utilize a different measure called spatial localization , which is a more selective signature of clustering and cluster shell structure .",
    "the localization , originally introduced for the identification of localized electronic groups in atomic and molecular systems @xcite , has recently been applied to characterize clusters in light nuclei @xcite . in this work , in addition to studies of cluster structures in deformed light nuclei , we employ this measure to identify fission fragments in heavy nuclei .",
    "this article is organized as follows : section  [ model ] gives a brief introduction to nuclear dft and the localization measure employed in this work . in sec .",
    "[ sec : loclight ] , the spatial nucleon localization measure is discussed for cluster configurations in light nuclei using a simple harmonic oscillator scheme and skyrme - dft . the results for fissioning heavy nuclei are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : heavynuclei - hfb ] . finally , the summary and outlook are given in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "in superfluid nuclear dft , the binding energy is expressed through the general density matrix @xcite . by applying the variational principle to s.p .",
    "wave functions ( kohn - sham orbitals ) , the self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) equations are derived .",
    "nuclear dft has been successfully used to describe properties of ground states and selected collective states across the nuclear landscape @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we use skyrme energy density functionals which are expressed in terms of local nucleonic densities and currents . for light nuclei discussed in sec . [",
    "sec : lightnuclei - hf ] , where pairing can be neglected , we solve the constrained hartree - fock ( hf ) problem with the functional unedf1-hfb @xcite . in the discussion of fissioning heavy nuclei in sec .",
    "[ sec : heavynuclei - hfb ] , pairing correlations are important . therein , we solve the constrained hfb problem with the unedf1 functional optimized for fission @xcite in the presence of pairing treated by means of the lipkin - nogami approximation as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the dft solvers used in this work are hfbtho @xcite and hfodd @xcite .",
    "they are both based on the expansion of s.p .",
    "wave functions in a deformed harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "the solver hfbtho assumes axial symmetry of the mean field potential while the general - purpose hfodd solver employed in our fission studies is symmetry - unconstrained .",
    "the spatial localization measure was originally introduced in atomic and molecular physics to characterize chemical bonds in electronic systems .",
    "it also turned out to be useful in visualizing cluster structures in light nuclei @xcite .",
    "it can be derived by considering the conditional probability of finding a nucleon within a distance @xmath7 from a given nucleon at @xmath8 with the same spin @xmath9 ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) and isospin @xmath12 ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the expansion of this probability with respect to @xmath7 can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the particle density , kinetic energy density , current density , and density gradient , respectively .",
    "they can be expressed through the canonical hfb orbits @xmath20 :    @xmath21 , \\\\ { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}}\\rho_{q\\sigma}({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}})&=&2\\sum_{\\alpha\\in q}v^2_{\\alpha}\\mathrm{re}[\\psi^*_\\alpha({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}\\sigma){\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}}\\psi_\\alpha({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}\\sigma)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath22 being the canonical occupation probability .",
    "thus , the expression in the parentheses of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : probability ] ) can serve as a localization measure .",
    "unfortunately , this expression is neither dimensionless nor normalized .",
    "a natural choice for normalization is the thomas - fermi kinetic energy density @xmath23 . considering that the spatial localization and @xmath24 are in an inverse relationship , a dimensionless and normalized expression for the localization measure can be written as @xmath25^{-1}.\\ ] ] in this work",
    ", time reversal symmetry is conserved ; hence , @xmath18 vanishes .",
    "a value of @xmath26 close to one indicates that the probability of finding two nucleons with the same spin and isospin at the same spatial location is very low .",
    "thus the nucleon s localization is large at that point . in particular , nucleons making up the alpha particle are perfectly localized @xcite .",
    "another interesting case is @xmath27 , which corresponds to a homogeneous fermi gas as found in nuclear matter . when applied to many - electron systems , the quantity @xmath26 is referred to as the electron localization function , or elf . in nuclear applications , the measure of localization ( [ eqn : localization ] ) shall thus be called the nucleon localization function ( nlf ) .",
    "the above definition of the nlf works well in regions with non - zero nucleonic density .",
    "when the local densities become very small in the regions outside the range of the nuclear mean field , numerical instabilities can appear .",
    "on the other hand , when the particle density is close to zero , localization is no longer a meaningful quantity .",
    "consequently , for finite nuclei , we multiply the nlf by a normalized particle density @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "( in nucleons/@xmath29 ) for prolate configurations in @xmath1be and @xmath2ne with @xmath30 , and for oblate configuration in @xmath31c with @xmath32 .",

    "[ model : localization ] .",
    "white dotted lines are the contour lines @xmath33 of the original definition ( [ eqn : localization ] ) . ]",
    "since the average potential in light nuclei can be fairly well approximated by that of the deformed harmonic oscillator ( ho ) @xcite , many properties of these systems can be characterized in terms of ho shell structure .",
    "quantum mechanically , the unusual stability of cluster states in light nuclei can be attributed to strong shell effects that are present in the ho potential at deformed shapes .",
    "indeed , in the deformed ho model the strongest level degeneracy occurs when the ratio of oscillator frequencies is a rational number ; this results in the appearance of supershells @xcite .",
    "consequently , the deformed ho model can serve as a rough guidance to describe cluster states @xcite . to this end , we first study the nlfs using the wave functions of the axial ho with frequencies @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for integer values of @xmath36 ( prolate shapes ) ,",
    "a supershell structure appears that is associated with the @xmath37-fold su(3 ) dynamical symmetry of the rational ho @xcite .",
    "for instance , for @xmath30 , the superdeformed magic numbers are @xmath38 , etc . for oblate shapes ,",
    "the degeneracy pattern of rational ho is different @xcite .",
    "for instance for @xmath32 the magic numbers are @xmath39 @xcite . in the examples below for @xmath40 nuclei ,",
    "we only show densities and nlfs for one combination of spin and isospin as time - reversal and isospin symmetries are conserved .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ho - localization ] we show particle densities and nlfs for superdeformed configurations in @xmath1be and @xmath2ne with @xmath30 , and for an oblate configuration in @xmath31c with @xmath32 .",
    "all of these configurations correspond to closed shells of deformed ho . in the case of @xmath1be , both the density and the nlf",
    "reveal two clear centers .",
    "the nlf values at these centers are close to one , which means that the nucleons are highly localized , implying the presence of @xmath0 clusters . for @xmath2ne ,",
    "the cluster structure is difficult to see in the particle density plot .",
    "however , the nlf clearly demonstrates the presence of two @xmath0 clusters at the tips and a ring structure around @xmath41 associated with an oblate - deformed @xmath31c nucleus .",
    "figures  [ fig : ho - localization](e ) and ( f ) indeed show that the @xmath32 configuration in @xmath31c exhibits a very similar localization pattern , except that the localization level is higher .",
    "this is easy to understand as the wave functions of @xmath0 clusters in @xmath2ne have a non - zero overlap with the ring ( @xmath31c ) structure , and this decreases the level of localization .      in order to compare the deformed ho results with a realistic nuclear model , we carry out nuclear dft calculations for @xmath1be and @xmath2ne . for light nuclei with @xmath40 , results for neutrons and protons are very similar as the coulomb contribution is small .",
    "therefore , we only consider neutron spin - up densities and nlfs . figures  [ fig : be8 ] and  [ fig : ne20 ] show results of constrained hf calculations with unedf1-hfb assuming good parity . here",
    ", the quadrupole and octupole deformations are defined through the corresponding axial multipole moments @xmath42 : @xmath43 figure  [ fig : be8 ] depicts @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the ground - state configuration of @xmath1be .",

    "our results for @xmath1be and @xmath2ne compare well with the hf - ski3 calculations of ref .  @xcite . in both cases , unmasked nlfs exhibit numerical artifacts in the low - density region , because the numerator and denominator in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : localization ] ) are both close to zero .",
    "if parity is not constrained in hf calculations , the ground state of @xmath2ne is expected to be reflection - asymmetric @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath50 configuration in @xmath2ne is predicted to have a cluster - like structure with a large octupole deformation , while the @xmath51 ground state is situated between cluster - like and spherical configurations . to illustrate this special case",
    ", we used hfodd to perform a constrained hfb calculation for @xmath2ne at the octupole deformation @xmath52 @xcite .",

    "[ fig : ne20-parity ] , the intrinsic configuration of @xmath2ne has a rather compact shape . a clear dip in the nlf at the center manifests a region where all wave functions overlap . a slight enhancement of the spatial localization near the tip is visible .",

    "both examples , @xmath3th and @xmath4pu , show in a rather dramatic fashion that the nlfs can serve as excellent fingerprints of both the formation and evolution of cluster structures in fissioning nuclei .",
    "in this work , we presented mean - field developments pertaining to the theoretical description of nucleonic clustering in light and heavy nuclei using the concept of nucleon localizations . following a schematic ho analysis , we carried out self - consistent dft calculations for light @xmath40 nuclei and heavy fissioning systems .",
    "we demonstrated that the nucleon spatial localization is a superb indicator of clustering in light and heavy nuclei ; the characteristic patterns of nlfs can serve as fingerprints of the single - particle shell structure associated with cluster configurations .",
    "in particular , the nlfs of @xmath46be,@xmath31c , and @xmath2ne can serve as excellent indications of @xmath0 clustering . here",
    ", we found that realistic hf calculations are not that far from the results of the deformed ho model . in fissioning nuclei",
    ", shell effects of nascent fragments leave a strong imprint on the localization .",
    "our dft analysis of fission evolution of @xmath3th and @xmath4pu demonstrates that the fragments are formed fairly early in the evolution , well before scission .",
    "future applications of nlfs will include studies of @xmath0 clustering in medium - mass nuclei as well as the identification of fission yields .",
    "another interesting use of nlfs will be in the description and visualization of collective rotational motion , where spin - up and spin - down localizations are different due to the breaking of time - reversal symmetry .",

    "<S> we illustrate the usefulness of the localization measure by showing    how the hyperdeformed state of @xmath3th can be    understood in terms of a quasimolecular state made of    @xmath5sn and @xmath6zr fragments . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    compared to nucleonic distributions , the nucleon localization function    more effectively quantifies nucleonic clustering in light and heavy    nuclei : its characteristic oscillating pattern , traced back to shell    effects , is a clear fingerprint of cluster / fragment configurations .    </S>",
