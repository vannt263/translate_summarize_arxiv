    "iin this paper , we consider a uniform , infinite universe with a spherical hole . ultimately , we intend to develop a new cosmological model for an expanding universe in which holes are the dominant feature .",
    "geller and huchra @xcite also indicate the importance of holes in the universe by writing ",
    "... it probably makes more physical sense to regard the individual voids as the fundamental structures . \"",
    "thus motivated , we consider the behavior of a hole in an otherwise infinite and uniform universe .",
    "we show first in section 2 , using newtonian theory , that there exists an outward - directed gravitational force acting away from the center of the spherical hole , and we develop a formula for this force .",
    "this force is referred to as negative gravity .",
    "then , in section 3 , we solve the newtonian differential equations to discover the expansionary behavior of the hole and develop certain formul to be used later .",
    "we show the same conclusion using the methods of einstein s general relativity in section 4 . the derivation of the standard schwarzschild solution for an attracting point particle of mass @xmath0 is well known .",
    "the results are summarized in section 4.1 , and several consequences are mentioned which will be important later when the techniques used in the solution of the schwarzschild problem are applied to a nonstatic distribution of mass .",
    "it is well known that particles and photons are attracted toward the mass . in the geodesic equations describing the motion of particles and photons , if the mass were negative",
    ", we would conclude that particles and photons would deflect away from the mass .",
    "although negative mass may not have any physical significance , it serves as an introduction to the main results of later sections .",
    "the concept of negative mass will be used in terms of superimposing on a uniform universe this schwarzschild solution for negative mass in order to simulate a mass deficiency ( hole ) in an otherwise uniform universe .",
    "section 4.2 gives a new interpretation of the solution of einstein s field equations for a uniform distribution of mass .",
    "this solution represents a flat geometry and reduces to the flat geometry of special relativity for mass density decreasing to zero .",
    "section 4.3 describes the effect of a spherical hole in a uniform universe . in these sections also",
    ", the physical significance of the cosmological constant is determined .",
    "if this were a linear universe , the two solutions from sections 4.2 and 4.3 could be superimposed . in a physically imaginable universe",
    "which is initially uniformly filled with mass except for a spherical hole , particles and photons are deflected away from the hole .",
    "this follows since the geometry of the uniform distribution is flat and does not affect the uniform motion of particles and photons , while the negative schwarzschild mass of section 4.2 would repel matter and photons .",
    "loosely speaking , the hole repels matter and energy .",
    "also in section 4.3 , a remarkably close connection is made between the schwarzschild solution and the newly discovered newtonian potential for holes , which includes the contribution of negative gravity .",
    "the purpose of section 4.4 is to show this using the fully nonlinear einstein field equations .",
    "finally , the geodesic equations are considered , and it is shown that particles and photons are deflected away from the hole .",
    "section 4.5 summarizes the results .",
    "section 5 gives a development of a new cosmology , based upon expanding holes in an infinite , uniform universe .",
    "this is based upon a paper by r. n. lewis @xcite , in which it is shown how structure could form from the interactions of nearby holes , resulting in the universe we observe today .",
    "the microwave background radiation , caused by gravitational redshift , and hubble s law are shown to be natural consequences of the model .",
    "we also discuss the relative abundances of elements throughout the universe , olbers paradox , and other observed phenomena .    finally ,",
    "in section 6 , we use some of the ideas and equations previously derived in order to calculate hubble s constant , the average mass density in the universe , and the cosmological constant .",
    "certain accurate astronomical data are used in the calculations . the value derived for hubble s constant",
    "is shown to lie within the experimentally - determined range for that constant , providing confidence that the underlying theory is correct .",
    "iin this section , we consider a newtonian approach to the gravitational force field in an infinite universe filled with a uniform distribution of mass with the exception of a spherical hole .",
    "physicists usually consider the potential and the force acting on a particle anywhere in such an infinite universe to be infinite , since a formal integration over space produces this result .",
    "however , we apply symmetry in our calculations to produce cancellations , which leads to a finite force at any point .",
    "this application of symmetry is mathematically equivalent to a cauchy - type integration , without which the integral would be infinite . whether this approach is valid depends on its agreement with the results of general relativity . using results in later sections of this paper , we show this to be the case .",
    "iwe consider an infinite , uniform distribution of matter with mass from a spherical region removed and evaluate the force field at any point .",
    "the three main hypotheses we use are :    1 .",
    "gravity obeys the ( newtonian ) inverse - square force law , and it acts over arbitrarily large distances and time intervals .",
    "the general relativistic aspects of this problem are taken up later in this paper .",
    "when necessary , matter will be considered to be distributed continuously rather than discretely throughout space . with this assumption ,",
    "the calculations become tractable . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference in effect on a point mass of a continuous distribution of matter versus a discretely distributed ( atomic ) set of matter is negligible .",
    "indeed , the only essential aspect of the distribution of matter which is used in the computations leading to the results in section 2.3 is spherical symmetry . also , when convenient , we will assume that the mass density is constant .",
    "the universe is spatially infinite .",
    "this , along with the constant mass density of hypothesis ( 2 ) , implies that the universe contains an infinite amount of mass .",
    "ihere , we present some results which depend only upon the inverse - square law of newtonian theory .",
    "see kittel , knight , and rudderman @xcite for appropriate computations involving gravitational forces .",
    "the following is a list of the necessary facts and formul :    1 .",
    "the gravitational force due to a spherical shell of mass of radius @xmath1 , ( infinitesimal ) thickness @xmath2 , and mass density @xmath3 ( mass per unit volume ) acting on a mass @xmath0 outside the shell ( @xmath4 ) is the same as if all of the mass of the shell were concentrated at the center of the sphere .",
    "mathematically , this is expressed as + @xmath5 + where @xmath6 is newton s gravitational constant ( @xmath7 x @xmath8 m@xmath9/kg s@xmath10 ) , @xmath11 is the distance from the center of the sphere to the mass , and @xmath12 is a unit vector from the center of the sphere toward the mass . in the case",
    "@xmath13 , a slight modification of the calculations leading to the above result yields @xmath14 2 .",
    "if we have the same situation as in ( 1 ) above , but the mass @xmath0 is inside the shell ( @xmath15 ) , then there is no gravitational force acting on the mass .",
    "therefore + @xmath16 + this result generalizes to the case of a spherical shell ( not infinitesimally thin ) of inner radius @xmath17 and outer radius @xmath18 .",
    "the gravitational force acting on @xmath0 inside @xmath17 is still @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , the above results generalize by integration to a sphere of mass acting on a mass @xmath0 .",
    "the force due to a sphere of mass of radius @xmath1 and mass density @xmath3 acting on a mass @xmath0 outside the sphere ( @xmath20 ) is the same as if all the mass were concentrated at the center .",
    "thus + @xmath21{{gm}\\o{r^2}}\\v{e}.\\ ] ] 4",
    ".   if we have the same situation as in ( 3 ) but the mass @xmath0 is inside the sphere ( @xmath15 ) , then all of the mass outside of @xmath11 contributes nothing to the force , and the mass inside of @xmath11 acts on @xmath0 as if it were concentrated at the center .",
    "therefore + @xmath22{{gm}\\o{r^2}}\\v{e } = -\\left({4\\o 3}\\right)\\pi r\\rho gm\\v{e}.\\ ] ]    finally , we mention that , for a finite , spherically symmetric ( not necessarily uniform ) mass distribution , the gravitational force of it on a point mass does not depend on the mass farther away from the center than the point mass , and is the same as if all of the mass closer to the center than the point mass were concentrated at the center .",
    "we will see in the next section how this result generalizes to infinite mass distributions , with unexpected results .",
    "ithe next question we ask is : what is the gravitational force on a point mass @xmath0 situated at a positive distance @xmath11 from the origin due to a uniformly distributed ( infinite ) mass external to a spherical hole with center at the origin and radius @xmath1 ( @xmath15 ) ? that is , what is the gravitational effect on a test particle in a spherical hole in an otherwise uniform universe ?",
    "if we consider the situation specified in the generalization of formula ( 2 ) in section 2.2 , and navely let @xmath23 , then we would conclude that the total force acting on @xmath0 is @xmath19 .",
    "however , this conclusion is not accurate , since the total mass which lies outside the sphere of radius @xmath18 is not spherically symmetric about @xmath0 ( although it is spherically symmetric about the center of the sphere ) , and does have an effect on @xmath0 .    in order to analyze this case , consider the situation depicted in figure 1 .",
    "we take the origin of our coordinate system at @xmath0 , with the center of the sphere @xmath24 , of radius @xmath1 , at a point @xmath11 units to the right of @xmath0 .",
    "then we draw a sphere , @xmath25 , with center at @xmath0 and radius @xmath26 .",
    "we also add a sphere , @xmath27 , concentric with @xmath24 , and with radius @xmath11 . since the mass external to @xmath25 is spherically symmetric with respect to @xmath0 , its total gravitational force on @xmath0 is @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the only effective force which will act on @xmath0 will be that due to the mass in the three - dimensional crescent - shaped region ( crescentoid ) , @xmath28 , which lies inside @xmath25 and outside @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    in order to handle this situation ,",
    "consider a totally uniform distribution of matter ( no hole ) with a test mass @xmath0 at the origin . by symmetry",
    ", there will be no force acting on @xmath0 . also by symmetry , the net force on @xmath0 due to all mass inside @xmath25 is @xmath19 .",
    "the force on @xmath0 due to all the mass in the spherical shell between @xmath27 and @xmath24 is @xmath19 , from the results of formula ( 2 ) and its generalization in section 2.2 .",
    "therefore , the mass in the region @xmath28 will have a force on @xmath0 which will exactly counterbalance the force on @xmath0 due to the mass inside @xmath27 . from section 2.2 , formula ( 4 )",
    ", we find the force on @xmath0 due to the mass inside @xmath27 to be @xmath29 , where @xmath12 is a unit vector from the center of @xmath27 toward @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the force on @xmath0 due to the mass in the shaded region ( crescentoid ) is    @xmath30    this will also be equal to the force acting on @xmath0 in a uniform universe with a hole ( either @xmath27 or @xmath24 ) , since the counterbalancing mass inside @xmath27 is not present .",
    "we note the interesting result that this force does not depend on @xmath1 . because of",
    "this , in some applications , we can think of @xmath1 as being arbitrarily large , and the crescentoid region in the figure as being arbitrarily far away from @xmath0 .",
    "the matter ( or absence of it ) in the spherical shell between @xmath27 and @xmath24 provides no contribution to the force on @xmath0 .",
    "we can therefore say that the force @xmath31 on @xmath0 given by the above formula is due to mass arbitrarily far away from @xmath0 .",
    "we also note that , as time passes , matter moves outward from the hole , destroying the constancy of matter but preserving spherical symmetry about the center of the hole .",
    "the above comments hold in this case as well , since the crescentoid region referred to above can be considered to be arbitrarily far from the motion and unaffected by it .",
    "the formula for force given above still applies , with @xmath11 a function of time .    at this point",
    ", we mention that a formal mathematical integration over all space , after applying symmetry considerations , yields the same result .",
    "we note that the force can be written as    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the mass deficiency of the hole ( out to @xmath11 ) .",
    "this shows that newton s inverse - square force law holds for negative masses ( holes ) acting on positive masses .",
    "this formula gives the force @xmath31 at any point inside the hole ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "however , spherical shells of matter of any radius greater than @xmath11 have no gravitational effect on a mass @xmath0 at @xmath11 , so we can think of @xmath1 as being arbitrarily large .",
    "thus , the above formula yields the outward force at any point inside r outside the hole .",
    "for a point outside ( @xmath20 ) the hole , however , there will be an additional inward - directed force due to all mass closer to the origin than @xmath11 .",
    "this inward force is    @xmath34gm}\\o{r^2}}\\v{e}. \\eqno ( 2)\\ ] ]    the sum of the above two forces yields the force due to a hole of radius @xmath1 in an otherwise infinite and uniform distribution of mass on a mass @xmath0 at distance @xmath11 ( @xmath35 ) from the origin ( that is , the force of a hole acting on a mass outside the hole ) .",
    "this force is    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the mass deficiency of the hole .",
    "this again shows the applicability of newton s inverse - square force law with one negative and one positive mass .",
    "it is tempting to say that newton s inverse - square force law holds for two negative masses as well .",
    "however , we would need to define what we mean by a force on a hole .",
    "we simply mention that two holes would have an effect on each other due to the above - mentioned force acting on the particles surrounding the holes",
    ". the net effect would be that the two holes would move toward each other and become slightly distorted .",
    "we conclude that positive masses attract each other , as do negative masses ( holes ) , but positive and negative masses repel each other .",
    "the implication of the above result is the following .",
    "the infinite amount of matter outside of a hole in an otherwise infinite and uniform distribution of matter will gravitationally draw matter out of the hole .",
    "we can loosely say that the hole repels matter , just as a concentration of matter would attract matter ( section 2.2 ) .",
    "we refer to this phenomenon as _",
    "negative gravity_. it must be remembered that this term refers to the apparent repulsion of matter by holes .",
    "in fact , the actual mechanism causing negative gravity is the positive gravitational attraction of  mass at infinity \" , that is , the mass in a crescentoid region arbitrarily far from the hole .",
    "the term negative gravity should not be taken to imply that the gravitational force between two particles is repulsive ; gravity is always attractive . as we shall see in section 4",
    ", however , the energy - momentum tensor in the neighborhood of a hole can be negative because of the above - described effect .",
    "ian obvious generalization to make to the above calculations is the following . in a spherically symmetric ( about the origin ) universe , the net force acting on a particle of mass @xmath0 at a distance @xmath11 from the origin is    @xmath38    where @xmath39 , is the difference in the average densities of matter outside and inside @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the density @xmath40 is the mass divided by the volume of the region inside @xmath11 .",
    "the density @xmath41 is the average mass density over the region external to the sphere of radius @xmath11 .",
    "we note that if @xmath42 , then this formula reduces to the formula in section 2.3 . if @xmath43 , ( i.e. if there is negligible mass outside a sphere of large radius , or if the mass density decreases to 0 as @xmath11 increases ) , then the net force is inward , the force being given by formula ( 3 ) in section 2.2 .",
    "thus , the basic underlying idea for negative gravity to exist is that @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath44 , we speculate that , even in the absence of total spherical symmetry , there will be a net outward force ( from centers of holes ) tending to pull things apart .",
    "inow let us investigate the behavior of a spherical hole in an otherwise infinite and uniform universe and form some conclusions about the rate of expansion . as we point out later",
    ", a slow expansion caused by negative gravity does occur .",
    "we model the problem mathematically and solve two specific problems ( sections 3.1 and 3.2 ) which assume that the age of the universe under consideration is infinite .",
    "the conclusions show the relatively large time intervals that are required for particles to move an appreciable distance .    under the assumptions given above",
    ", the outwardly - directed negative gravitational force acts at each point of space . for a particle of mass @xmath0 ,",
    "the force was given above by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "this formula holds no matter what @xmath11 is . in other words",
    ", it holds both inside ( @xmath15 ) and outside ( @xmath20 ) the hole , although when the point is outside the hole , there is also an inward - directed force @xmath45 [ equ .",
    "( 2 ) ] due to all mass inside @xmath11 . in fact",
    ", this formula holds even in a nonuniform universe as long as the universe is spherically symmetric about the origin and @xmath3 represents the average mass density .",
    "ilet us suppose that we have a universe of discrete hydrogen atoms .",
    "such a universe can not be uniform ( continuous ) except in a statistical sense , but it can be spherically symmetric about the origin . let us suppose that this is the case and that an atom , @xmath46 , lies at the origin .",
    "we also assume that the average mass density , @xmath3 , is one atom per cubic meter ( @xmath47 x @xmath48 kg / m@xmath9 ) .",
    "this is roughly on the same order of the value that current observations of luminous matter lead us to believe .",
    "the presence of unobserved matter would increase this value .",
    "the actual value of @xmath3 is immaterial to the conclusion we wish to draw . because of the density assumption , we assume that the nearest other atoms are one meter ( 1 m ) from the origin . to @xmath46 ,",
    "the other atoms appear to be distributed spherically - symmetrically over all space outside of a hole of radius one meter .",
    "now , let @xmath46 be displaced a distance @xmath49 m in any direction .",
    "let @xmath50 represent this configuration , with @xmath51 representing the original spherically - symmetric universe .",
    "the hypotheses ( a test particle in a hole in a spherically - symmetric universe ) of section 1 are satisfied .",
    "the outward force given in that section acts on the atom @xmath46 .",
    "newton s second law of motion implies that    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is a position vector of the particle . the initial value problem for @xmath11 , therefore , is    @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56    let @xmath57^{1/2 } = 6.84 $ ] x @xmath58 s@xmath59 .",
    "then the solution of the initial value problem is    @xmath60    according to this differential equation model , the time , @xmath61 , it takes for the mass @xmath0 ( hydrogen atom ) to reach the edge of the hole ( @xmath62 m ) and its corresponding velocity depend on @xmath63 .",
    "for example , if @xmath64 m , @xmath65 x @xmath66 years .",
    "if @xmath67 m , @xmath68 x @xmath66 years . in both cases , since @xmath69 , and since @xmath62 m , then @xmath70 x @xmath58 m / s .",

    "the conclusion we arrive at is that it takes infinitely long to transform the universe from configuration @xmath51 to configuration @xmath73 for @xmath74 m.    there are two aspects of this model that need clarification .",
    "the first is that , as the hydrogen atom @xmath46 moves , it also gravitationally affects all the other atoms in the universe , displacing them slightly and destroying the spherical symmetry of the universe outside the hole . to counter this problem",
    ", we argue that the conclusion we reached at the end of the previous paragraph is still valid . the reason to believe this is that the smaller the value of @xmath63    is , the better the initial value problem @xmath75 models the physical situation . in the next section ,",
    "we present a model in which spherical symmetry is preserved , so that this problem does not arise .",
    "the other remark to make is a positive one .",
    "this model allows us to start with a uniform universe , @xmath51 , at time @xmath76 ( let @xmath72 ) instead of starting at a particular time , @xmath77 (  big bang \" ) , with a particular mass density and having to worry about what happened before that time or about what caused things to happen .",
    "inow let us consider a uniform ( rather than a discrete ) distribution of mass [ @xmath78 x @xmath48 kg / m@xmath9 ] and suppose that , at time @xmath80 , a spherical hole of radius @xmath1 is introduced , centered at the origin @xmath81 .",

    "because of the initial outward - directed force , all particles will be accelerated outward .",
    "we will see later that this outward motion will continue forever .    at this point ,",

    "the net effect of one particle passing another would be a decrease in acceleration on the passing particle and an increase in acceleration on the passed particle .",

    "we will assume that this situation holds for all @xmath128 .",
    "since particles that start farther out always move slower , the particles which began closer to the origin will begin to catch up to , but never overtake , the more distant particles .",
    "thus , an outward moving spherical wave of matter starts to build up at the edge of the hole .",
    "now let us find out how long the above process takes .",

    "we assume the existence of many holes throughout the universe , without specifying how they came into being . perhaps there were always slight imperfections in the uniformity which",
    ", as we earlier pointed out , would gradually grow in size .",
    "another possibility for the introduction of holes is some quantum effect which would destroy the total uniformity of the universe .",
    "whatever the cause , we assume that it repeated itself throughout the universe to form enough holes so that the ensuing evolution described below could occur .",
    "these holes , or any regions of lower than average mass density , would expand outward , just as lumps , or regions of higher than average mass density , would attract other mass toward itself . in other words ,",
    "the infinite , uniform universe is unstable .",
    "we can imagine many expanding holes existing throughout the universe .",
    "r. n. lewis @xcite referred to this configuration as the swiss - cheese universe . later , as two holes came together , a sheet of matter would form between them , and the sheets of matter , looking at the entire conglomeration , would look like a foamy mixture , named the foam universe . still later , as the holes continue to expand and encroach upon each other s territory , the matter in the sheets would migrate toward the edge of the sheet , forming filaments connecting matter concentrations .",
    "this network configuration is referred to as the network universe . even later",
    "still , the filaments would split and be drawn gravitationally toward a concentration of matter .",
    "this arrangement is referred to as the caltrop universe because the appearance of one of these concentrations of matter is similar to a medieval caltrop .",
    "when astronomers peer outward toward other galaxies , they notice just this type of structure .",
    "galactic clusters seem to be connected to each other by filaments of galaxies , and , in turn , they appear clustered , not randomly , but in sheets , just the structure predicted above .",
    "galaxies and clusters are , in turn , separated from each other by gigantic voids which occur naturally in the above - described theory .",
    "it therefore appears that this view of the universe is better able to explain the observed structure of the universe than is the big bang theory , whose proponents are still arguing about how the universe could have differentiated into stars , galaxies , and galactic clusters in the relatively short time since the big bang .",
    "what is necessary for the above evolution to have occurred as stated ?",
    "the only requirements are an infinite universe , matter distributed somewhat uniformly throughout it , and the existence of randomly - scattered holes .",
    "the matter that was once distributed uniformly has been pushed or pulled together into galaxies , surrounded by emptyness , that we observe when looking out into the universe today . assuming that these galaxies are distributed somewhat uniformly throughout our universe , as most cosmologists believe today",
    ", then the outward force of negative gravity must also exist at this time , tending to push the universe apart .",
    "we can imagine that the universe we observe ( perhaps 10 billion light years or more in radius ) has an average mass density slightly less that that at infinity .",
    "one possible mechanism for this to happen is the following . assuming that there were events that occurred to form each of the holes initially all over the universe , it is conceivable that the effect of those events sufficiently far away from us havent been felt yet on earth , so that we on earth observe the average mass density in our neighborhood to be less than that farther out . our neighborhood ( radius unspecified ) of the universe and the galaxies in it , therefore , effectively reside in a large hole , with the force of negative gravity pushing outward",
    "of course , under this scenario of locality , this same comment would apply to any observer situated at any point of the universe .",
    "therefore , the same lower - than - average mass density and the same expansion must be observed everywhere .",
    "ithe outward force due to negative gravity at any point was given above in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "in addition to that outward force , there is an additional inward force due to the positive gravitational force of all mass closer to the center of the hole than the mass [ equ.(2 ) ] .",
    "the total force was given earlier as equation ( 8a ) .",
    "we also gave the corresponding potential as equation ( 8b ) .",
    "it is well known that light escaping from a gravitating body undergoes a shift in frequency due to the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "the shift is given by    @xmath318    where @xmath319 is the frequency of the emitted wave , @xmath320 is its change in frequency , and @xmath321 is the change in potential .    in calculating @xmath321",
    ", there is a contribution from the emitting galaxy and one from the observing galaxy ( our own ) , each dependent on the gravitational mass of the respective galaxies . for a galaxy of roughly the same size as our own",
    ", these contributions will cancel . on the other hand ,",
    "a much more massive galaxy may exhibit a relatively large gravitational redshift .",
    "there is also a doppler - type effect due to relative velocity , which is currently believed to be the primary cause of observed frequency shift .",
    "assuming that the visible universe resides in an expanding hole ( see section 5.1 ) , there will also be a contribution from the potential of the hole due to negative gravity .",
    "this newtonian potential [ see equ .",
    "( 8b ) ] is proportional to @xmath265 for large @xmath11 , and could overwhelm the contributions from the other gravitational effects .",
    "it could do the same relative to doppler effects as well .",
    "it is apparent that whatever frequency shift is observed , at least four causes must be taken into account in the analysis : frequency shift caused by ( 1 ) gravitational effect of emitting galaxy , ( 2 ) gravitational effect of absorbing galaxy , ( 3 ) gravitational effect of negative gravity , and ( 4 ) doppler effect due to relative motion .",
    "however , we can conclude that the effects of ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) above reinforce each other , so that the observed redshift is not entirely due to relative motion .",
    "in other words , the estimated velocity of recession from observations of redshifted light is exaggerated , especially for galaxies which are relatively far away . in the past",
    ", an observed redshift value has been interpreted as indicating a certain distance and velocity of recession ( hubble s law ) . however ,",
    "if ( negative ) gravitational effects as well as relative motion are taken into account , the observed redshift would indicate a slower ( less doppler redshift ) galaxy which is closer to us .",
    "the observed redshift should not be attributed entirely to doppler effects , nor entirely to gravitational effects .",
    "the negative gravitational redshift becomes increasingly important the larger that @xmath11 becomes .",
    "we note that , for @xmath322 light years , equation ( 30 ) yields a gravitational redshift given by @xmath323 x @xmath324 , which is significant when dealing with galaxies at that distance . in observing distant galaxies ,",
    "this must be taken into account .",
    "for example , the great wall @xcite , distances to which are predicted on the basis of observed redshift values , is at a distance where negative gravitational effects are significant . more importantly",
    ", however , these negative gravitational effects will affect the microwave background radiation ( see below ) .    because of the above comments , the entire big bang theory needs to be reevaluated in light of negative gravity .",
    "an entirely new cosmology based upon expansion due to negative gravity has been developed .",
    "r. n. lewis @xcite shows one approach to this .",
    "in fact , his explanation gives a simple account for the present structure of the universe which the big bang theory can not explain adequately without internal contradictions .",
    "a new cosmology was developed in which large velocities ( see section 3.2 ) are achieved due entirely to the effects of negative gravity over much larger time intervals ( many orders of magnitude ) than are currently believed to be required for expansion to our present state .",
    "we also showed that hubble s law holds in this case .",
    "for this cosmology , all that is required is that the visible universe , as well as possibly much more , resides in a region of slightly smaller mass density than that at infinity .",
    "this would allow negative gravity , as well as all of its consequences , to function .",
    "the observed abundances of helium , deuterium , and other heavier elements in the universe can be explained by supernova activity during the longer time intervals .",
    "it is currently believed that supernova activity since the big bang was not sufficient to produce anywhere near the amount of heavier elements that are observed in the universe .",
    "the amount of helium present is estimated to be from @xmath325 to @xmath326 of the mass of the universe , with a preference for a figure of @xmath327 .",
    "it is thought that perhaps one - tenth of that amount could have been produced in supernovas in the @xmath325 billion years since the big bang . in a universe which has been around forever and which may have been nuclearly active for @xmath328 billion years",
    ", the observed abundances of helium and other heavier elements could easily have been produced .",
    "the uniform microwave background radiation could be accounted for by the radiation of all galaxies .",
    "our sun radiates at close to blackbody levels .",
    "we expect the same of other stars and galaxies .",
    "averaged out over regions of the sky , we expect the radiation coming from other galaxies to be uniform and of blackbody type .",
    "indeed , data from the cosmic background explorer @xcite support this conclusion .",
    "it is generally agreed that the main nonuniformity in the background radiation is due to the fact that we are in motion relative to the source of that radiation .",
    "most cosmologists believe that the motion is due to the big bang",
    ". the motion could be due to a general expansion caused by negative gravity .",
    "we also expect the radiation from other galaxies to be redshifted because of relative motion . from the discussion above",
    ", it is apparent that radiation is also redshifted because of the negative gravitational potential .",
    "this redshifted radiation is observed in the microwave region .",
    "it is interesting to note that the singularity implicit in equation ( 22b ) ( which gives the metric tensor : @xmath329 ) ,    @xmath330    yields a redshift from equation ( 30 ) of    @xmath331    this value being independent of @xmath332 or @xmath3 .",
    "if the microwave background radiation is actually due to an integration of the radiation of all galaxies , it would indicate a redshift of @xmath333 , corresponding to a temperature of 2.73 k and stellar surface temperatures on the order of 5000 k ( possibly less in the cooler , earlier universe ) .",
    "thus , it seems likely that the origin of the microwave background radiation must be @xmath334 to @xmath335 times more distant than @xmath336 , if we are to attribute the redshift to gravitational , rather than doppler , effects .",
    "more likely , it is due to a combination of the two effects .",
    "the singularity needs to be investigated further .",
    "however , it must be remembered that our universe is not exactly as modeled , so that the singularity shown above for a uniform universe with a spherical hole may not be a singularity for an uneven universe such as our own .",
    "the value @xmath337 found above is larger than most observed galactic redshifts .",
    "however , some recent observations of quasar redshifts are on the order of @xmath338 .",
    "these can be explained by doppler effects or positive gravitational effects due to incredibly high concentrations of mass , possibly in combination with the negative gravitational redshift .",
    "our sun s gravitational redshift is about @xmath323 x @xmath339 .",
    "a redshift of @xmath340 could result from a star or quasar with mass - to - radius radio of @xmath323 x @xmath143 times that of our sun .",
    "weinberg ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 11.6.20 ) ) gives an upper bound of @xmath341 for gravitational redshift in a universe with zero cosmological constant .",
    "as can be seen from the equation before weinberg s equation ( 11.6.20 ) , using our equation ( 11 ) for his @xmath342 , a positive @xmath343 mediates a higher value of @xmath344 .",
    "of course this view of cosmology denies the great cosmological principle of isotropy and homogeneity and the principle of covariance by giving preference to centers of holes , at least at the present time .",
    "if we travel backward in time , the universe as has been presented here should appear more homogeneous and colder , so that these principles would have been more valid at earlier times .",
    "but , of course , as we look outward toward the heavens , we see that the universe is not isotropic nor homogeneous , so this should not be of concern .",
    "olbers paradox has an interesting explanation in this new theory of cosmology .",
    "wesson @xcite gives an explanation based upon the finite age of the universe and on inflation of the universe .",
    "this new theory does not require inflation or the big bang , but we can still invoke wesson s argument of the finite age of the universe by stating that , at earlier times , the universe was less radiant ( less hot ) .",
    "furthermore , another interesting explanation lies in the interpretation of the light ray geodesics .",
    "these bend outward , so that radiation from far enough away never reaches us !    one final comment deals with whether the universe is open or closed .",
    "this and the structure of the universe seem to be two of the most important open questions in the study of cosmology . in any cosmology based upon negative gravity ,",
    "the universe is not only open , but its expansion is accelerating outward .",
    "there is not any great mass pulling it inward .",
    "in fact , the  mass at infinity \" is pulling it apart .",
    "iwhy should we believe in a cosmology based upon negative gravity rather than one based upon the big bang ?",
    "the big bang theory was developed to explain the observed redshift of light coming from distant galaxies .",
    "this redshift , in turn , was explained by attributing it to recessional motion , mainly because no other explanation for the observed redshift was known .",
    "this motion was then attributed to a general expansion of the universe .",
    "it was argued that this expansion could only be explained by extrapolating back to a time when an explosion ( big bang ) caused the motion we apparently observe today .",
    "no other mechanism for expansion was known . the subsequent discovery of the microwave background radiation fit in with this theory very nicely .",
    "this radiation was thought to be the remnant radiation left over from the big bang .",
    "it was further deduced that the expansion must be decelerating due to the inward pull of the finite mass distribution .",
    "the theory was further refined to include other recent observations , including the presence and concentration of heavy elements .",
    "the theory still has trouble explaining the observed structure of the universe , including the presence of large voids and the clustering of galaxies .",
    "recent observations from the cosmic background explorer @xcite show the  early universe \" to be almost perfectly uniform and homogeneous , not leaving enough time for matter to have differentiated and formed into the universe that we observe today .",
    "the theory of the development of the universe presented here , which is based on negative gravity in an infinite universe , does not have this shortcoming .",
    "it predicts the gross structure of the universe on the basis of mass being pushed or pulled together by the combined negative gravitational effects of adjacent holes @xcite .",
    "in addition , it presents a viable alternate explanation of the observed redshift of galactic radiation and of the microwave background radiation .",
    "the observed redshift of galactic light can be explained as due partly to recessional motion of expansion and partly to gravitational redshift , both ( expansion and gravitational redshift ) caused by the negative gravitational potential of  mass at infinity \" .",
    "it is possible to separate out the contribution to the redshift @xmath344 due to negative gravity and that due to recessional motion , assuming that some form of hubble s law is still valid .",
    "in fact , earlier , we showed that @xmath345 ( velocity proportional to distance ) for such a universe , which shows that hubble s law ( with constant @xmath121 ) is valid , without the necessity of extrapolating back in time to a singularity .",
    "in addition , the microwave background radiation can also be associated with a redshift of radiation due to the negative gravitational potential .",
    "finally , the abundances of elements other than hydrogen can be explained by supernova activity over the incredibly long life of the luminous universe ( at least an order of magnitude larger than is currently believed ) .",
    "this new theory predicts an expansion which originated rather benignly in a cold , ( relatively ) motionless , infinite universe and which has accelerated outward and will continue to accelerate outward forever .",
    "the purpose of this section is to use some of the equations derived in previous sections to deduce accurate values for the average mass density of the universe , @xmath194 , hubble s constant , @xmath46 , and the cosmological constant , @xmath164 .",
    "these calculations are based upon fairly accurate data , including redshift and distance data to specific galaxies .",
    "the computations can be done for any such galaxies , but we concentrate on one , m87 , for a variety of reasons .",
    "section 6.1 details these reasons and the specific data we use .",
    "section 6.2 includes the calculations of the different constants .",
    "finally , in section 6.3 , a summary and conclusions as well as justification of the methods developed here are presented .",
    "iin order to perform the calculations of the values of the particular constants , specific astronomical data are needed .",
    "there are several very good reasons why the galaxy m87 would yield reliable data on which the conclusions we reach are based .",
    "second , it is close enough to us that its distance from us can be fairly accurately measured by standard ( not redshift ) means .",
    "this measured distance is @xmath347 million light years @xcite .",
    "we will use both figures in our calculations .",
    "any error in measuring this distance will show up later in our calculation of the values of the constants .",
    "m87 is also close enough that small @xmath344 approximations should be valid .",
    "third , it lies near the center of the virgo cluster of galaxies , and is relatively motionless with respect to that cluster .",
    "therefore , such motions caused by local gravitational effects ( such as rotation about the center ) are not an added complication .",
    "we assume that the entire redshift , @xmath344 , is due to universal expansion ( see above for more details ; this expansion is not due to the big bang ) , and that local gravitationally - induced motions are insignificant .",
    "m87 is far enough away that this seems to be a reasonable assumption .",
    "fourth , m87 lies in the general direction toward which our galaxy and galactic cluster are moving .",
    "the observation of our direction of motion is based upon relative microwave background radiation measurements .",
    "for this reason , the calculations based upon negative gravity should be relatively accurate on the assumption that the virgo cluster is farther out than we are along a radial direction from the center of expansion .",
    "one drawback of using m87 is that it is a huge galaxy relative to our own , roughly @xmath348 times as massive @xcite . as such",
    ", it may have associated with it a significant gravitational redshift compared with ours , which may have to be accounted for in the calculations . ignoring this possible gravitational redshift , as we do here , means that the results for @xmath349 and @xmath350 later in this paper are upper bounds and may need to be reduced , thus changing the other calculated values .",
    "one problem associated with the use of data from only one galaxy is that the galaxy we choose may not be typical .",
    "a more comprehensive study could be done using a statistical analysis of data from many different galaxies , with proper precautions being taken to account for , in particular , the phenomenon referred to in the fourth category above .",
    "however , the fact that our calculation below gives a value of the hubble constant in the middle of the experimentally - determined range should convince the reader that m87 is a reasonable choice and that this approach is a sound one .",
    "ifirst , using the notation @xmath344 for redshift , we identify three causes of redshift : ( 1 ) redshift due to recessional motion , @xmath349 , ( 2 ) redshift due to negative gravity , @xmath350 , and ( 3 ) gravitational redshift , @xmath351 . for a given value of @xmath344 , the wavelength of the radiation has been shifted by a factor of @xmath352 .",
    "therefore , @xmath353 .",
    "we assume that @xmath351 is negligible , so that the above equation can be replaced by @xmath354 or              in these equations , @xmath157 is the speed of light in a vacuum , @xmath359 is the velocity of recession , @xmath11 is distance , @xmath194 is mass density , and @xmath6 is the gravitational constant . therefore ,                          since the @xmath11 values are line - of - sight distances and are probably greater than the difference in distance from the center of the main expansion , the @xmath11 values should be reduced by an indeterminant amount , thus resulting in a larger value for @xmath194 .",
    "the approximate value of @xmath194 used earlier was @xmath47 x @xmath48 kg / m@xmath9 , roughly one - tenth the value calculated above .",
    "rubin @xcite finds that the average value of @xmath194 , at least in our visible universe , is @xmath369 x @xmath48 kg / m@xmath9 .",
    "this figure is based upon gravitational calculations and is about @xmath370 times larger than observations of luminous matter lead us to believe .",
    "thus , rubin s calculations indicate that a large percentage of the matter in the universe is nonluminous .",
    "if these are accurate figures , they indicate that the average mass density at infinity is roughly @xmath371 times what it is in our neighborhood , which is in line with the assumption made above and referred to in section 5 .",
    "we note that the range of values we derive by this method for hubble s constant is right in the middle of the range of values currently used for that value .",
    "it corresponds to the value @xmath373 km / s / mpc .",
    "this correlation of values must lend credence to this line of reasoning .",
    "it is extremely unlikely that we would end up with this degree of accuracy , compared with experimentally - determined values , if the underlying theory were not correct .",
    "iin this section , we have used certain astronomical data , certain well - established formul , and several new formul for calculating the values of the average mass density of the universe , @xmath194 , the hubble constant , @xmath46 , and the cosmological constant , @xmath164 .",
    "these values are found to be in the ranges :          the fact that @xmath46 lies exactly in the middle of the experimentally - determined range of values for that constant must mean several things .",
    "first and most importantly , it signifies that the underlying theory of negative gravity must be correct .",
    "otherwise , it would be exceedingly improbable that the calculated value would be anywhere near the experimental value .",
    "in fact , we use formula ( 37 ) above which is based upon a gravitational potential which is on the order of @xmath378 times larger than the one normally used in astronomical calculations . with the values of @xmath11 used here , the difference is about @xmath379 orders of magnitude .",
    "if the underlying theory were not correct , the calculated values should be different to a corresponding degree .",
    "second , it shows that our use of the galaxy m87 was a reasonable choice .",
    "third , it serves to pin down the value of the hubble constant even closer .",
    "fourth , the values given for the cosmological constant and for the average mass density of the universe should be relatively accurate .",
    "it should be pointed out that this is the first attempt to actually assign a nonzero value to the cosmological constant and to calculate the average mass density in an infinite universe .",
    "finally , let us observe that , in the above calculations , there were several places where it was indicated that certain values might need to be reduced for various reasons , while , in other places , just the opposite was indicated .",
    "again , since the calculated value of the hubble constant falls in the experimentally - determined range , it is reasonable to conclude that the above mentioned changes approximately balance each other ."
