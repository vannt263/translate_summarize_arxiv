    "an accurate knowledge of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) is essential for the standard model ( sm ) and new physics hard scattering processes such as those performed at the tevatron and lhc . in recent years , several global quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) analyses of pdfs",
    "have been performed @xcite , and considerable progress has been made to improve our knowledge of the pdfs .",
    "however , many problems remain open , because there are diverse sources of the experimental and theoretical uncertainties in the conventional approach to extract specific pdf sets . in this vein , including new data measured at hadron colliders in global analyses is one of the beneficial ways to put further constraints on pdfs .",
    "one of the important issues in any global analysis of pdfs is the determination of the gluon and sea quark distributions .",
    "although the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and fixed - target data can be use to put overall constraints on pdfs , the inclusion of the tevatron and lhc measurements in the analysis for more accurate determination of them is necessary . in hadron - hadron collisions ,",
    "the high - energy photons are mainly produced directly in a hard parton scattering process .",
    "for this reason , and due to their pointlike electromagnetic coupling to the quarks , they provide a clean probe of parton - level dynamics  @xcite . measurements of the @xmath2-quark jet differential cross section where @xmath3 is charm or bottom quark as a function of photon transverse momentum @xmath4  @xcite can improve our understanding of the underlying production mechanism and also provide useful input for the gluon and heavy quark pdf of the colliding hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the most contribution to the cross section comes from the compton subprocess @xmath5 , though at the tevatron the annihilation subprocess @xmath6 becomes also important especially at large @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , one of the very sensitive measurements to the gluon and charm quark pdfs is data from the d0 experiment at the tevatron of the differential @xmath0-jet production @xcite .",
    "these data can be recognized as a serious challenge for the perturbative qcd since they overshoot the standard next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd predictions at large transverse photon momenta . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the inclusion of an intrinsic charm ( ic ) quark component in the nucleon can decrease the difference between data and theory , but not fully resolve it . actually , a part of this discrepancy might be due the lake of higher - order corrections to @xmath7 channel which is not included in  @xcite",
    ". note also that in ref .",
    "@xcite the d0 data had not been included in the global analysis .    in dis ,",
    "the quantity that is very sensitive to the gluon and charm quark pdfs is the charm structure function @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to the recent hera measurements of this quantity  @xcite , there are also older emc collaboration measurements  @xcite that include a broader range of the bjorken scaling variable @xmath8 .",
    "actually , these data are the only existing measurements of the charm structure function at large @xmath9 and can be recognized as an evidence for intrinsic component in the proton . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been indicated that the theoretical description of the emc @xmath10 data is poor , both at large and low @xmath8 values .",
    "moreover , it was shown that considering the ic contribution can improve the results at large @xmath9 .",
    "however , it should be noted that in that work the emc data had not been included in the global analysis .",
    "recently , some new global analyses by considering these data have been presented  @xcite , and all of them found that , in a conventional approach of qcd analysis , the fit of emc data is far from satisfactory .    the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of the differential @xmath0-jet cross section data from d0 on the pdfs by performing a nlo global analysis .",
    "moreover , we are going to investigate the impact of older emc measurements of charm structure function @xmath1 on the pdfs and compare the results with those gaining from the analysis of tevatron data .",
    "actually , since both d0 and emc data show some evidences for the existence of non - perturbative charm in the proton , we predict that these data should have a same impact on the pdfs . in this regard",
    ", we perform some global analyses as follows .",
    "first , we fit to a fairly standard selection of experimental data sets from various observables and experiments to gain pdfs that are well constrained , actually , it is our base fit .",
    "then , the d0 and emc data are separately included in this global analysis to study the impact of them on the pdfs behaviour and answering the question that whether they have same effects on the final results or not ? note that , in comparison with previous analysis performed by including the emc data in fit process  @xcite , we include a variety of the lhc and tevatron data and also new high precision hera i+ii combined data @xcite in our analysis .",
    "furthermore , we use more restrictive kinematic cuts which is more traditional in qcd global analysis of pdfs .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pho ] and  [ sec : emc ] , we briefly review the physics of the prompt photon production in association with a @xmath11-jet in hadronic collisions and charm production in dis , respectively , that are needed in the theoretical description of d0 and emc data . then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : qcd ] , we introduce our qcd analysis framework including the experimental data sets are used , kinematic cuts , pdf parametrizations , the @xmath12 definition and etc . in sec .",

    "[ sec : con ] , we summarize our results and present conclusions .",
    "in recent years , the prompt photon production in association with a heavy quark jet in hadronic collisions has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally in many studies@xcite .",
    "for example , the differential cross section for the associated production of a @xmath11-quark jet and an isolated photon in @xmath13 collisions at center - of - mass energy @xmath14  tev as a function of photon transverse momentum @xmath4 has measured in ref .",
    "they have measured the @xmath0-jet cross section for photons with rapidity @xmath15 and transverse momentum @xmath16  gev so that the @xmath17-jet has @xmath18 and @xmath19  gev .",
    "this process can provide some information of parton distributions of the nucleons and also a powerful tool for testing the possibility of the existence of intrinsic charm quarks in the nucleon .    at leading order ( lo ) , the compton subprocess @xmath20 gives the main contribution to the @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) that is dominant at low @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , the annihilation subprocess @xmath22 becomes important at large @xmath4  @xcite .     in the s - channel ( left ) and t - channel ( right ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=47.0% ]    note that at lo , the inclusive @xmath23 production can arises from the subprocesses @xmath24 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 where the fragmentation of a @xmath27-quark produces a photon . at the lhc ,",
    "the annihilation process @xmath22 dose not act an important role and the compton process dominates for all energies .",
    "the subprocesses within the nlo are more complicated than lo .",
    "they include also the processes like @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite where the photon is effectually created via radiation off of an intermediate quark line .",
    "it is worth noting that all subprocesses at nlo , apart from the annihilation subprocess , are @xmath30 and @xmath11 pdf initiated .",
    "thus , the cross section at the nlo is more dependent on the gluon and charm pdfs @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we investigate the impact of the differential @xmath0-jet cross section data from d0 on the pdfs by performing a nlo global analysis .",
    "the determination of gluon and sea quark distributions in the nucleon with lower uncertainties has always been a challenge in global analyses of pdfs .",
    "one can use , in the first step , the deep inelastic structure functions @xmath31 data ( or reduced cross sections ) to put an overall constraint on the gluon and sea quark densities .",
    "then , the various measurements from drell - yan experiments and hadron collisions can be considered to reduce further their uncertainties . in this respect , if we are looking for more information about the charm quark pdf , we can invoke the charm structure function @xmath32 data since it is sensitive to the charm distribution , and for complementary , use the measurements of the prompt photon production in association with charm quark at colliders .",
    "although the hera measurements of @xmath32  @xcite cover only the @xmath33 region , the emc collaboration  @xcite measurements cover a broader range of @xmath8 including both small and large @xmath8 regions .",
    "the difficultly of fitting these emc data has been highlighted previously in refs .",
    "these data are extremely old .",
    "emc had some issues in the measurement of the total structure function , which was eventually understood and led to the emc inclusive structure function not being included in pdf analyses .",
    "the measurement of the charm structure function may suffer from some of the same issues as the inclusive data .",
    "furthermore , a tension between these data and hera  @xcite have been observed in our analysis , same as the reported results in ref .",
    "consequently , the data are very rarely used in pdfs global analyses . on the other hand ,",
    "the emc data are recognized as an evidence for the existence of the intrinsic charm in the nucleon because they are not in complete agreement with the predictions of the standard qcd calculations at large @xmath9 . to be more precise ,",
    "the theoretical predictions underestimate the emc data at @xmath34 and overestimate them at smaller values of @xmath8 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is demonstrated that the theoretical description of the emc @xmath10 data is poor , both at large and low @xmath9 values . in this way , using the emc data in a global analysis of pdfs leads to an increase in the total @xmath35 value .",
    "in addition , it can strongly affects the behaviour of pdfs .",
    "these facts can be considered as main reasons to reject the emc data from performed global analyses of pdfs  @xcite . in this work , by performing some global analyses , we are looking to study in details the impact of the emc data on the behaviour of the parton distributions in different kinematic regions .",
    "in this section , we present a brief overview of the standard theoretical formalism and experimental data used for performing the qcd global analyses .",
    "it is worth pointing out in this context that in the present study , the nlo qcd analysis and pdfs extraction is performed by herafitter framework  @xcite .",
    "the experimental data used cover a satisfying range of dis and colliders data .",
    "actually , we use the dis data from hera  @xcite , bcdms  @xcite , ccfr  @xcite , slac  @xcite and nmc  @xcite to constrain the pdfs behaviour . in order to put further constraint on the pdfs and",
    "reduce their uncertainties , we also used the inclusive jets of h@xmath36@xcite and zeus  @xcite , and several lhc and tevatron data such as @xmath37 and @xmath38 production by d  @xcite , cdf  @xcite , atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations .",
    "all experimantal data sets have been listed in the first column of tab .",
    "[ tslac ] .",
    "we include then the emc charm data @xcite and photon production in association with a charm quark by d  @xcite at different stages of our research to study the impact of theses data on the extracted pdfs .",
    "note that the dis data from hera , bcdms and slac constrain the gluon and sea quark distributions well in all range of the @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the valence quark distributions and the difference between @xmath39 and @xmath40 distributions can be controlled directly from the ccfr @xmath41 and nmc @xmath42 data , respectively . moreover",
    ", the hera charm data  @xcite can give us some valuable information about the gluon distribution in small @xmath8 regions .",
    "note that we applied the kinematics cuts @xmath43 gev@xmath44 and @xmath45 gev@xmath44 on the data ( only for @xmath41 data , we considered @xmath46 gev@xmath44 ) to avoid the non - perturbative and higher - twist effects .",
    "since we are not looking here for a comprehensive global analysis of pdfs and our main goal is the study of the impact of emc and d  data on pdfs , it is satisfying to use of simple flexible parametrization forms for input parton densities such as herapdf form  @xcite : @xmath47 however , it should be noted that the optimal parametrization forms for the pdf fit can be found through a parametrization scan as described in  @xcite . in this way , we used the following parametrization for valence quarks @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the anti - quarks @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and finally the gluon @xmath54 at the input scale @xmath55 gev@xmath44 , @xmath56    although , at first glance , the number of unknown parameters in eqs .",
    "[ eq : paramf ] is high , we can reduce it with the help of sum rules and also by considering some simplifying assumptions . to be more precise",
    ", we can fix three parameters by using the momentum and valence quark number sum rules . in this vein , we choose @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 as usual . for parameter @xmath60 in valence and sea",
    "quarks pdfs , we consider constraints @xmath61 and @xmath62 . the contribution of the strange quark density is taken to be proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "it has been shown that a value of 0.31 is a good estimation for factor @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we consider an additional constraint @xmath65 that guarantees the same behaviour of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 as @xmath68 . after these simplifying assumptions , the number of unknown parameters should be determined by the fit will be 14 .",
    "it should also be noted that in the present work , the qcd coupling constant is taken to be equal to @xmath69 at the @xmath70 boson mass scale .    now it s time to discuss about the nuclear corrections of the pdfs required for analysing the emc structure function data .",
    "in fact , since these data have been obtained by scattering on a heavy nuclear target , considering the nuclear corrections of the pdfs is inevitable and can also improve the goodness of fit .",
    "we know that the parton distributions of a proton bound in a nucleus of mass number @xmath71 can be related to corresponding distributions of a free proton according to following relation @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the nuclear correction for parton flavor @xmath74 . in this work",
    ", we use the nuclear corrections obtained by de florian and sassot  @xcite through a nlo global analysis of nuclear data .",
    "in addition to the nuclear corrections , we need a factor to consider the mismatch between the partonic and hadronic charm thresholds . in this respect ,",
    "we apply the weight factor @xmath75 on heavy structure function as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to include well the effects of heavy quark masses , we utilize a general - mass variable flavour number",
    "( gm - vfn ) scheme is called thorne - roberts ( tr ) scheme  @xcite in the calculation of the structure functions . for performing theoretical predictions corresponding to the measurements of hadron colliders we use amcfast  @xcite , applgrid  @xcite , madgraph5_amc@nlo  @xcite and mcfm  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in our analysis , the renormalisation and factorisation scales set to @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , the charm and bottom quark masses are taken to be equal to @xmath77 = 1.4 gev and @xmath78 = 4.75 gev , respectively .    in any global analysis of pdfs , the unknown parameters are determined by minimisation of a @xmath12 function compares the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of various physical observables . in this regard , taking into account correlated and uncorrelated measurement uncertainties correctly using a covariance matrix has an important role in the extraction of the pdfs uncertainties . to be more precise ,",
    "if @xmath79 be the theory prediction corresponding to a data point @xmath80 which individual sources of its correlated uncertainty are not available , the @xmath12 function can be expressed in the following form : @xmath81 but for other data points , with including the full correlated error information , it is defined as : @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the data values allowed to shift by some multiple @xmath84 of the systematic error @xmath85 in order to give the best fit .",
    "the last term is called the penalty term . as a last point",
    ", we should mention also that the hessian ( eigenvector ) method  @xcite has been used for propagating experimental uncertainties to pdfs .",
    "actually , one of the best virtues of the herafitter program is that the hessian method can be implemented through it automatically .",

    "note , however , that in contrast with the hera1 + 2 ncep 920 and bcdms data , the slac data @xcite indicate an opposite behaviour .",
    "this compatibility between slac data with emc and d0 data might be an indication of the notion that slac data are sensitive to ic component as demonstrated in ref .",

    "part of this discrepancy may be due to the lack of higher - order perturbative qcd corrections which is dominated by the annihilation process @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 ) for high @xmath87 .",
    "on the other hand , it might also be an evidence for the existence of non - perturbative charm component in the proton . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that considering the ic contribution reduces the discrepancy between theory and data but not fully resolve it , even with considering 3.5% ic contribution .    according to the obtained results , the study of the pdfs behaviour in these analyses can be very interesting and instructive .",

    "<S> the recent measurement of the differential @xmath0-jet cross section , performed at the tevatron collider in run ii by the d0 collaboration , is studied in a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) global qcd analysis to assess its impact on the proton parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these data lead to a significant change on the gluon and charm quark distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate also that there is an inconsistency between the new high precision hera i+ii combined data and tevatron measurement . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in this study we investigate the impact of older emc measurements of charm structure function @xmath1 on the pdfs and compare the results with those gaining from the analysis of tevatron data . </S>",
    "<S> we show that both of them have a same impact on pdfs , and thus can be recognized as same evidences for inefficiency of perturbative qcd in dealing with the charm production in some kinematic regions . </S>"
