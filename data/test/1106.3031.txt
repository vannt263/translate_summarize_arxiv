    "general relativity concerns a geometrical formulation of gravity and has as a tenet a pseudo - riemannian geometry for the manifolds taken in consideration .",
    "however , this is an arbitrary choice and is intended to preserve scalar products between vectors and , consequently , their lengths when parallel transported along an arbitrary path on the manifold .    nevertheless , considering that in this theory the characterization of space - time is made by rulers and clocks based on light rays emission and reception ,",
    "ehlers , pirani and schild@xcite ( eps ) , followed by woodhouse,@xcite have shown that the pseudo - riemannian geometry represents a restriction among the possibilities those measuring tools allow .",
    "that is , starting from axioms concerning light rays and trajectories of freely falling particles you get , necessarily , a weyl geometry as the most general one .",
    "this , in turn , differs from the pseudo - riemannian one by allowing vectors to change their modulus when paralel transported along any curve .",
    "weyl s motivation was to geometrize electromagnetism , with the intend to unify it with gravitation , and the length variation of vectors was associated with the electromagnetic potential.@xcite being so , it suffered some criticisms that made it be abandoned .",
    "however , the axiomatic characterization of space - time by eps and woodhouse bring weyl geometry to light once again . this time there is no association of length variation with any known physical field . the vector field that performs such a variation , which we will call @xmath0 , is purely geometrical , and thus the objections raised before are transcended .    in sec .",
    "[ sec - propriedades ] are presented the main properties of weyl geometry . from them , preserving the postulate that test particles travel through time - like geodesics , it is verified that those should be different from the pseudo - riemannian case of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the @xmath0 field appears giving extra contributions to the trajectories of material particles and thus influencing on an observable of the theory .",
    "this is one of the motivations to study einstein gravity in weyl geometry : as a way to determine how or to what extent one can use the new geometric field to make the theory more consistent .    in the following section it is made a brief study of congruences of curves in weyl .",
    "it is defined the concept of physical distance between neighboring curves and it is shown that their evolution is given by a linear transformation . next ,",
    "the matrix of this transformation is decomposed in their irreducible parts , which are the corresponding expressions for the expansion , shear and rotation from gr .    in sec .",
    "[ sec - form varia e acopl ] we restrict the weyl geometry to its integrable version , where @xmath1 . in this case ,",
    "variations of length depend only on the starting and ending points of the trajectory .",
    "variational formulations are presented for both obtaining gravitation in this geometry and for particles to follow geodesics .",
    "it is established how other physical fields are coupled with the new geometric one and it is observed that the coupling used endows our theory with a gauge symmetry inducing a conformal invariance .    as discussed in ref .",
    ", since dirac@xcite raised the question about the gravitational constant be , in fact , a constant , this problem has been a challenge for theoretical physics .",
    "however , it is argued that this can be solved by taking into account the principle that all fundamental equations of physics must be invariant under local transformations of scale , as proposed by weyl@xcite and hoyle and narlikar.@xcite it is therefore of great theoretical interest to examine a conformal invariant version of gravitation .",
    "other versions of a non - conformal model for the gravitational interaction in weyl integrable space - times ( wist ) were already developed@xcite and applications were made in cosmology@xcite and in spherically symmetric configurations for modeling stars.@xcite besides that , the wist geometry has been used to describe the quantum behavior of a particle in an external potential in the non - relativistic@xcite and the relativistic@xcite regime .",
    "nevertheless , none of them has formulated the theory in this gauge invariant way .",
    "carrying on with the reformulation of the theory , it remained to redefine the observables of gr within this formalism . in sec .",
    "[ sec - red - shift ] this is done for the red - shift and in sec .",
    "[ sec - verif inv conf ] it is shown that it preserves the gauge symmetry of the theory , as expected .",
    "moreover , in sec .",
    "[ sec - inv conf em mod cosmo ] it is shown that for cosmological models the conformal invariance opens the possibility that observations may no longer indicate a curvature nor an evolution to the metric .",
    "all observations and conclusions from the red - shift in gr being fully described in terms of the @xmath2 field .",
    "we conclude that this reformulation of einstein s gravitation in the more general and axiomatic context of weyl geometries turns out to acquire a gauge symmetry that , although it represents a theoretical advance , introduces an indeterminacy of their objects which needs to be solved , for consistency .",
    "weyl s geometry differs from that of riemann by allowing vectors to also change their modules when parallel transported along a closed path .",
    "this can be summarized by the following expression for the covariant derivative of the metric:@xcite    @xmath3    this implies a connection given by    @xmath4    where symbols with hat refer to their equivalent in the riemannian case .    from it",
    ", we can also conclude that for any vector @xmath5 we have :    @xmath6    then , the most general geodesic equation is given by :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the tangent vector of the geodesic and @xmath9 is the parameter which describes it .",
    "we consider a congruence of curves @xmath10 , @xmath11 , which in a local coordinate system @xmath12 , have coordinates @xmath13 and we take the parameter @xmath14 so that    @xmath15    two neighboring points , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , define a new vector which we will call _ connection vector_. their components are @xmath18 and it is associated with the distance , on the manifold , between the points @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the physical distance , locally determined by an observer at rest in relation to what has the curve @xmath21 as world line , is given by @xmath22 , which we will call _ relative position vector _ , where @xmath23 makes the projection of any vector in the space perpendicular to @xmath8 .",
    "introducing the notation @xmath24 to any vector @xmath5 , the relative velocity between two neighboring particles in the congruence is given by @xmath25 and is related to @xmath26 by the following equation :    @xmath27    by the property @xmath28 , we can simplify the result to    @xmath29    where we have defined @xmath30 .",
    "this shows that the velocity of separation between neighboring particles is related to the relative position vector by a linear transformation .",
    "it can be easily verified that @xmath31 , then we have their irreducible parts :    @xmath32 } \\end{array}\\right\\}\\;\\rightarrow\\ ; v_{\\alpha\\beta } = \\omega_{\\alpha\\beta } + \\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta } + \\frac{1}{3}\\theta h_{\\alpha\\beta } \\ , .",

    "although we are not with the riemannian connection anymore , the parameter we have defined is such that @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are still related to the expansion , shear and rotation of the congruence respectively.@xcite",
    "in order to make this geometric description compatible with a variational principle for the dynamics of a particle in a gravitational field,@xcite we will restrict ourselves to a particular case of weyl geometry which is called weyl integrable space - time ( wist ) in what follows .",
    "this is done simply by restricting the field @xmath38 to a gradient .",
    "that is , from now on we will consider only    @xmath39    this kind of geometry is easily obtained by performing a palatini approach to the action    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the ricci scalar and we follow the sign conventions of ref .  .",
    "variation of the connection gives precisely ( [ conexao de weyl ] ) with ( [ omega em wist ] ) , what is necessary and suficient to give ( [ deriv da metrica em weyl ] ) ensuring we are in wist .",
    "variation of the metric and @xmath2 gives respectively :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the einstein tensor .",
    "we see that variation of @xmath2 gives a redundant equation , since ( [ variacao de omega - vacuo ] ) is the same as the trace of ( [ variacao da metrica - vacuo ] ) .",
    "such equality implies in a freedom to one of the functions to be determined .",
    "soon it will be shown what this freedom can imply in turn .    for test particles to obey the geodesic equation ( [ eq geodesica em weyl ] )",
    ", we first note that in wist we have    @xmath44    so , the equation becomes    @xmath45    moreover , according to refs .   and , in order to characterize a good clock for the observer who follows this geodesic , we should choose such a parameter in which the right hand side of the above equation is zero .",
    "this is achieved by precisely that same parameter @xmath14 defined before , in ( [ parametro afim ] ) .",
    "this equation is obtained by the following action for a test particle with mass @xmath46 :    @xmath47    if we now notice that    @xmath48    that is , the connection is just like the riemannian one ( christoffel symbol ) written with @xmath49 , we see that things work much like they were in riemann , but with @xmath49 instead of @xmath50 whenever it appears .",
    "that is exactly what happened in the action ( [ acao para part teste em wist ] ) and hence in the geodesic equation ( [ eq geodesica em wist ] ) . specially if we take the parameter @xmath51 defined in sec .",
    "[ sec - congruencia de curvas ] , which is again another case of replacing @xmath50 by @xmath49 in the definition of the affine parameter in the riemannian case .",
    "moreover , the situation is the same in ( [ acao para weyl - vacuo ] ) : since we have @xmath52 , the einstein - hilbert action becomes    @xmath53    now we have made these considerations , it is quite clear that the most natural choice for coupling other fields with @xmath2 is by keeping this same recipe . that is , we take any other lagrangian of the form @xmath54 , in gr , and write it as @xmath55 .",
    "then , we will have for our wist action :    @xmath56\\sqrt{-\\tilde{g}}d^4x \\ , . \\label{acao inv conf wist}\\ ] ]    variation of the connection gives us wist .",
    "variation with respect to the metric gives    @xmath57 e^{\\omega}\\sqrt{-\\tilde{g } } = 0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\nonumber \\\\",

    "so we still have a freedom to one of the functions to be determined .",
    "but now it is very clear where this freedom comes from .",
    "since the function @xmath2 always appears together with the metric in the form @xmath49 , it is just a matter to see that it remains unchanged under the transformation    @xmath60    so we have an arbitrariness in the fields that keeps the theory just developed invariant .",
    "such invariance should be present in all observables defined on this theory , and so , our next task is to check it for the red - shift .",
    "we will now define it in this new context and show that it is invariant under the above transformation .",
    "following the lines of ref .",
    "we have for the geometrical optics approximation that light rays follow trajectories whose tangent vector , @xmath61 , is given by :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is a phase .",
    "moreover , according to ( [ contracao de x com deriv de x ii ] ) , we also have @xmath64 . since @xmath65",
    ", we then have @xmath66 .",
    "this , in turn , implies    @xmath67    that is , light rays follow null geodesics just like the manifold was riemannian instead of a weyl one .    for the red - shift we have the following relation between the frequency of the electromagnetic waves in the moment of emission , @xmath68 , and observation , @xmath69 :    @xmath70    the red - shift , @xmath71 , of a source as measured by an observer",
    "is defined in terms of wavelenghts by    @xmath72    which determines the red - shift from the vectors @xmath73 , @xmath74 and the tangent vector @xmath61 of the null geodesic .",
    "this relation is valid regardless of the separation between the emitter and the observer and accounts for both doppler and gravitational red - shift .",
    "next , we make the following decomposition of @xmath61 : we consider an observer with four - velocity @xmath8 and let @xmath75 be a projection of @xmath61 into the observer s rest frame , given by    @xmath76    taking @xmath77 as the parameter along the null geodesic , we have @xmath78 and we can calculate the variation of @xmath79 on an interval @xmath80 along it as being . ]",
    "@xmath81    from ( [ decomp irredutivel para v ] ) and ( [ decomp de k em u e n ] ) we can rewrite it as    @xmath82    now , from ( [ def do redshift ] ) we have    @xmath83    which gives the variation of the wavelength along a small increment @xmath80 on the parameter that describes the light ray .",
    "next , we show that both this expression and ( [ def do redshift ] ) are gauge invariants , as expected .",
    "let us examine the invariance of the objects that characterize the red - shift under the conformal transformation ( [ transformacao metrica e omega ] ) .",
    "we see that the following quantities from their definitions are transformed as follows :    @xmath84    thus , we have    @xmath85    and we confirm the invariance of ( [ def do redshift ] ) . for equation ( [ variacao infinitesimal de lambda 3 ] )",
    "we have    @xmath86    and their different terms are transformed as :    @xmath87    given ( [ transformacao de uk ] ) , it remains only to determine the transformation of @xmath80 , which is obtained from    @xmath88    so we have    @xmath89    and we see that the gauge freedom of our theory still holds for the red - shift , preserving the arbitrariness to one of their geometrical objects .",
    "we have the friedmann model for the three possible curvatures in a weyl geometry where , initially , @xmath90 :    @xmath91 \\label{metrica de friedmann em f(rho)}\\ ] ]    where @xmath92 is equal to @xmath93 , @xmath94 or @xmath95 for the spherical , flat and hyperbolic cases , respectively .",

    ", we make the transformation ( [ transformacao metrica e omega ] ) and we are now with a weyl geometry where @xmath101 , @xmath102 and we have the same expression for the red - shift .",
    "that is , we now have the possibility that observations of red - shift can be attributed to the field @xmath2 of a weyl geometry in minkowski space . no longer indicating a curvature nor evolution to the metric",
    "likewise , we could have done something in between , _",
    "i.e. _ , a gauge transformation to get @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
