    "furthermore , with appropriate coefficients , the unique dimension-5 operator can account for majorana neutrino masses , and the baryon number violating dimension-6 operators are consistent with the experimental bounds on proton decay .    in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model",
    "the distinction between higgs and matter is generically lost . since the lepton doublets and one of the higgs doublets have the same gauge quantum numbers the most general supersymmetric gauge invariant lagrangian contains unsuppressed @xmath0-parity violating terms which lead to rapid proton decay . in grand unified models ( guts )",
    "@xcite colour triplet exchange can also generate dangerous baryon number violating dimension-5 operators .",
    "these problems can be overcome by introducing continuous or discrete symmetries which distinguish between higgs and matter fields , such as @xmath0-symmetry , peccei - quinn type symmetries or matter parity .",
    "however , in the context of four - dimensional ( 4d ) field theories the origin and theoretical justification of these symmetries remain unclear .",
    "higher - dimensional theories provide a promising framework for unified extensions of the supersymmetric standard model @xcite .",
    "in particular the heterotic string @xcite with gauge group @xmath2 is the natural candidate for a unified theory including gravity .",
    "its compactifications on orbifolds @xcite yield chiral gauge theories in four dimensions including the standard model as well as gut gauge groups . during the past years",
    "some progress has been made in deriving unified field theories from the heterotic string @xcite , separating the gut scale from the string scale on anisotropic orbifolds @xcite , and a class of compactifications yielding supersymmetric standard models in four dimensions have been successfully constructed @xcite .",
    "the heterotic string model @xcite has a 6d orbifold gut limit , where two compact dimensions are much larger than the other four , with 6d bulk gauge group @xmath3 and unbroken @xmath4 symmetry at two fixed points .",
    "the corresponding supergravity model has been explicitly constructed in @xcite , and it has been shown that all bulk and brane anomalies are canceled by the green - schwarz mechanism . furthermore , a class of vacua has been found which have a pair of bulk higgs fields and two @xmath4 bulk families in addition to the two @xmath4 brane families . at the @xmath4",
    "fixed points these fields form an @xmath4 gut model . in 4d",
    "one obtains one quark - lepton ` family ' and a pair of higgs doublets from split bulk multiplets together with the two brane families .",
    "what distinguishes higgs from matter fields with the same @xmath4 quantum numbers in an orbifold gut ? in the vacuum studied in @xcite there is no distinction , which leads to unacceptable @xmath0-parity violating yukawa couplings . in @xcite interesting 4d vacua with unbroken matter parity were found , which allow to forbid the dangerous @xmath0-parity violating couplings .",
    "some of these vacua also have gauge - higgs unification for which an intriguing relationship exists between @xmath1-term and gravitino mass .",
    "indeed , several vacua with semi - realistic yukawa couplings could be identified where to order six in powers of standard model singlets @xmath1-term and gravitino mass both vanish .    in this paper",
    "we further analyse the vacua of the 6d orbifold gut @xcite .",
    "since @xmath5 , we consider vacua with expectation values ( vevs ) of all 6d zero modes .",
    "one then obtains further vacua with unbroken matter parity .",
    "the localized fayet - iliopoulos terms of anomalous @xmath6 symmetries may indeed stabilize two compact dimensions at the gut scale @xcite but the study of stabilization and profiles of bulk fields @xcite is beyond the scope of this paper . in the following",

    "the existence of a matter parity is not sufficient to distinguish higgs from matter .",
    "one also needs that the @xmath1-term is much smaller than the decoupling mass of exotic states . in principle",
    ", there are two obvious solutions : either a non - zero @xmath1-term is generated at very high powers in standard model singlets , or the perturbative part of the @xmath1-term vanishes exactly and a non - perturbative contribution , possibly related to supersymmetry breaking , yields a correction of the order of the electroweak scale . in section  4",
    ", we shall discuss how to identify ` maximal ' vacua with vanishing @xmath1-term , as well as extended vacua with @xmath1-terms generated at high orders .",
    "this is the main point of our paper .",
    "the maximal vacua with vanishing @xmath1-term do not include the case of gauge - higgs unification .",
    "instead , we find a vacuum with two pairs of massless higgs doublets and one with partial gauge - higgs unification only for @xmath7 which gives mass to up - type quarks .",
    "this is perfectly consistent with the fact that a large top - quark mass is singled out .",
    "the original symmetry between @xmath8- and @xmath9-plets is violated by selecting vacua where matter belongs to @xmath9- and @xmath10-plets .",
    "there are also other promising approaches which use elements of unification to find realistic string vacua .",
    "this includes compactifications on calabi - yau manifolds with vector bundles @xcite , which are related to orbifold constructions whose singularities are blown up @xcite . very recently ,",
    "also interesting gut models based on f - theory have been discussed @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we recall some symmetry properties of effective @xmath4 field theories , which are relevant for the @xmath1-term and baryon number violating interactions .",
    "the relevant features of the 6d orbifold gut model @xcite are briefly reviewed in section  3 .",
    "new vacua of this model with vanishing @xmath1-term and gravitino mass are analyzed in section  4 , and the corresponding unbroken discrete @xmath0-symmetries are determined .",
    "yukawa couplings for these vacua are calculated in section  5 .",
    "the heterotic 6d gut model @xcite has local su(5 ) invariance corresponding to georgi - glashow unification .",
    "hence , the superpotential of the corresponding low energy 4d field theory has the general form , @xmath11 where we have included dimension-5 operators . here",
    "@xmath12 denote generation indices , and for simplicity we have kept the @xmath4 notation . note that the colour triplets contained in the higgs fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 are projected out . @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 yield the well known renormalizable baryon ( b ) and lepton ( l ) number violating interactions , and the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the dimension-5 operators are usually obtained by integrating out states with masses @xmath19 . in supergravity theories also",
    "the expectation value of the superpotential is important since it determines the gravitino mass .",
    "one expects @xmath20 if the scale @xmath21 of electroweak symmetry breaking is related to supersymmetry breaking .    experimental bounds on the proton lifetime and lepton number violating processes",
    "imply @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , one has to accommodate the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the gut scale , @xmath25 . on the other hand",
    ", lepton number violation should not be too much suppressed , since @xmath26 yields the right order of magnitude for neutrino masses .",
    "these phenomenological requirements can be implemented by means of continuous or discrete symmetries . imposing an additional @xmath6 factor with @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the standard model hypercharge",
    ", one has @xmath29 , since these operators contain only @xmath30 violating terms . on the other hand , @xmath18 conserves @xmath30 and",
    "is therefore not affected .",
    "the canonical @xmath31 charges read @xmath32 with @xmath33 the wanted result , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , can be obtained with a @xmath36 subgroup of @xmath31 , which contains the ` matter parity ' @xmath37 @xcite , @xmath38 matter parity , however , does not solve the problem @xmath39 , and also the hierarchy @xmath40 remains unexplained .    in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , electroweak symmetry breaking",
    "is usually tied to supersymmetry breaking .",
    "it is then natural to have @xmath41 for unbroken supersymmetry .",
    "one easily verifies that in this case , for @xmath42 , the superpotential aquires a unique peccei - quinn type @xmath43 symmetry with charges @xmath44 together with an additional @xmath45 symmetry with @xmath0-charges @xmath46 note that the @xmath45-symmetry implies the wanted relations @xmath47 , with @xmath17 unconstrained .",
    "on the other hand , the peccei - quinn symmetry only yields @xmath48 .",
    "the latter relations can also be obtained by imposing only a discrete @xmath49 subgroup with @xmath50-parities @xmath51 on the contrary , the familiar @xmath0-parity , which is preserved by non - zero gaugino masses , @xmath52 implies @xmath34 , whereas @xmath1 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are all allowed .    in summary , the unwanted terms in the lagrangian ( [ effective ] ) can be forbidden by a continuous global @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "supersymmetry breaking will also break @xmath45 to @xmath0-parity , which may lead to an @xmath0-axion .",
    "the dangerous terms @xmath1 and @xmath18 will then be proportional to the soft supersymmetry breaking terms and therefore strongly suppressed . alternatively , the unwanted terms in ( [ effective ] ) can be forbidden by discrete symmetries , such as matter parity , pq - parity or @xmath0-parity .    in ordinary 4d gut models",
    "continuous or discrete symmetries can be introduced by hand .",
    "it is interesting to see how protecting global symmetries arise in higher - dimensional theories .",
    "the global @xmath53 symmetry ( [ u1r ] ) indeed occurs naturally @xcite , and it has been used in 5d and 6d orbifold guts @xcite .",
    "however , as we shall see in the following sections , orbifold compactifications of the heterotic string single out discrete symmetries , which may or may not commute with supersymmetry .",
    "let us now briefly describe the main ingredients of the 6d orbifold gut model derived in @xcite .",

    "the model has bulk fields living in ten dimensions and fields from twisted sectors , which are confined to six or four dimensions .",
    "the model has twelve fixed points where the @xmath54 symmetry is broken to different subgroups whose intersection is the standard model gauge group up to @xmath6 factors .",
    "the geometry has an interesting six - dimensional orbifold gut limit which is obtained by shrinking the relative size of @xmath67 as compared to @xmath68 .",
    "such an anisotropy can account geometrically for the hierachy between the string scale and the gut scale .",
    "the space group embedding @xcite includes one wilson line along a one - cycle in @xmath67 , and a second one as a non - trivial representation of a lattice shift within @xmath68 .",

    "the original symmetry between @xmath8- and @xmath9-plets is broken by selecting vacua where matter belongs to @xmath9- and @xmath10-plets .",

    "in addition to the vanishing of some couplings one may require the appearance of certain couplings , like yukawa couplings or majorana neutrino masses .",
    "the features of the standard model imply strong constraints on phenomenolocially allowed vacua .",
