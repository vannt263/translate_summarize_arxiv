    "scalar variational inequalities ( for short vi ) apply to study a wide range of problems , such as equilibrium and optimization problems , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "generalizations toward vector vi were initiated in @xcite ; for recent results and surveys on this field see @xcite .",
    "a major peculiarity in vector  valued inequalities is the necessity to introduce at least two different solution concepts , e.g. a strong and a weak one .",
    "this approach seems to be most natural if referred to vector optimization efficiency and weak efficiency notions .",
    "the notion of differentiable variational inequalities arises in the scalar case , when the operator involved in a vi has a primitive function .",
    "this kind of vi is widely studied because of its relation to optimization problems . under mild continuity assumptions , scalar minty vi ( mvi , @xcite ) of differential type",
    "provide a sufficient optimality condition to the primitive optimization problem ( a result popularized as minty variational principle ) , while scalar stampacchia vi ( svi , @xcite ) is only necessary . assuming some convexity on the primitive function ( or monotonicity of the derivative ) both vis are necessary and sufficient optimality conditions . in @xcite , under generalized differentiability assumptions , scalar minty vi have been studied and it has been proved that the existence of a solution to such a problem implies some regularity property on the primitive optimization problem .",
    "the same approach has been proposed by giannessi @xcite for vector optimization . in his seminal paper ,",
    "giannessi studied the relations between a stampacchia type vector variational inequality and weak efficient solutions of the primitive vector optimization problem .",
    "it has been proved that the scalar relations hold under stronger assumption in the vector case , namely convexity plays a bigger role in the proof .",
    "further researches tried to extend the result to efficient solutions , providing a stronger version of the variational inequality and highlighting some peculiarities of the vector case unknown for scalar functions .",
    "more recently , also the minty variational principle has been studied and extended to the vector case .",
    "the problem has been posed by giannessi in @xcite , where the links between minty vis and vector optimization problems were investigated both for efficient and weak efficient solutions .",
    "more recently , in @xcite , some generalization of the vector variational principle have been proposed in conjuction with weak efficient solutions . in @xcite ,",
    "the case of a differentiable objective function @xmath0 with values in @xmath1 and a pareto ordering cone has been studied , proving a vector minty variational principle for pseudoconvex functions . in @xcite",
    "a similar result has been extended to the case of an arbitrary ordering cone and a non - differentiable objective function .",
    "overall , the existing literature pictures a wreath of relations , ranging between weak and strong vector  valued inequalities and weak efficiency and efficiency . some of these relations occur only under ( generalized ) convexity assumptions , some of the branches can not be fixed .",
    "although optimization of set - valued functions has been a fast growing topic over the past decades , very few has been proposed about variational inequalities to characterize minimality .",
    "since the first results by corley @xcite and dinh the luc @xcite , based on a vector optimization approach , several papers have been proposed to provide optimality conditions .",
    "nevertheless , the main approach to derivatives ( and therefore to the core of a variational inequality ) has been far distant form the basic differential quotient method adopted for scalar ( and vector ) problems .",
    "more recently , a new paradigm , known as set optimization , has been proposed , compare @xcite . in this framework",
    ", the very concept of optimal solutions has been thought anew , together with operations among sets , now elements of a complete ordered conlinear space .",
    "this leads to overcome some drawbacks in previous attempts to provide variational inequalities for set - valued optimization problems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a notion of weak minimality for set optimization is presented , motivated by its relation with standard weak efficiency in vector optimization . under certain regularity assumptions",
    "it is proven in @xcite that the solutions of the minty type inequality are weak minimizers of the primitive set optimization problem . under slightly weaker assumptions ,",
    "a weak minimizer of the set optimization problem solves the stampacchia differential variational inequality . under convexity assumptions on the scalarizations ,",
    "the reverse implications has been proven in @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a corresponding chain of implications has been provided for minimizers , actually for solutions of set optimization problems , and the corresponding minty and stampacchia type differential variational inequalities .",
    "the aim of this paper is to combine lose branches from the previous studies between set optimization and set - valued variational inequalities , connecting strong notions in @xcite with their weak counterparts presented in @xcite . as a special case of our results ,",
    "we obtain a wreath containing vector optimization efficient and weak efficient solutions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the general setting of the problem and the basic notation and assumption in section 2 , where some details on conlinear spaces are recalled . in section 3",
    "we introduce the notion of minimizer and weak minimizer in set optimization , as well as the scalarization technique that is used to prove the main results .",
    "the variational inequalities introduced in @xcite and @xcite are also recalled together with the chains of implications proved in these papers .",
    "section 4 completes the picture with the main results proving the missing implications .",
