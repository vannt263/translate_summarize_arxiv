    "it is believed that the direct detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) will bring the era of gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "the interferometer detectors are now under operation and awaiting the first signal of gws  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) can be used as a detector for gws @xcite .",
    "these detectors are used to search for very low frequency ( @xmath0 ) gravitational waves , where the lower limit of the observable frequencies is determined by the inverse of total observation time @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the total observation time has a crucial role in ptas , because ptas are most sensitive near the lower edge of observable frequencies @xcite . taking into account its sensitivity ,",
    "the first direct detection of the gravitational waves might be achieved by ptas .",
    "the main target of ptas is the stochastic gravitational wave background ( sgwb ) generated by a large number of unresolved sources with the astrophysical origin or the cosmological origin in the early universe .",
    "the promising sources are super massive black hole binaries  @xcite , cosmic ( super)string  @xcite , and inflation  @xcite .",
    "previous studies have assumed that the sgwb is isotropic and unpolarized  @xcite .",
    "these assumptions are reasonable for the primary detection of the sgwb , but the deviation from the isotropy and the polarizations should have rich information of sources of gravitational waves .",
    "recently , the cross - correlation formalism has been generalized to deal with anisotropy in the sgwb @xcite .",
    "result of this work enables us to consider arbitrary levels of anisotropy , and a bayesian approach was performed by using this formalism @xcite . on the other hand , for the anisotropy of the sgwb , the cross - correlation formalism has been also developed in the case of interferometer detectors  @xcite .",
    "as to the polarization , there are works including the ones motivated by the modified gravity  @xcite",
    ". we can envisage supermassive black hole binaries emit circularly polarized sgwb due to the chern - simons term  @xcite .",
    "there may also exist cosmological sgwb with circular polarization in the presence of parity violating term in gravity sector  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the detectability of circular polarization in the sgwb by ptas .",
    "we characterize sgwb by the so called stokes @xmath2 parameter  @xcite and calculate generalized overlap reduction functions ( orfs ) so that we can probe the circular polarization of the sgwb .",
    "we also discuss a method to separate the intensity ( @xmath3 mode ) and circular polarization ( @xmath2 mode ) of the sgwb .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "stokes parameters for a plane gravitational wave ] , we introduce the stokes parameters for monochromatic plane gravitational waves , and clarify the physical meaning of the stokes parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in section [ sec : formulation ] , we formulate the cross - correlation formalism for anisotropic circularly polarized sgwb with ptas .",
    "the basic framework is essentially a combination of the formalism of @xcite , and the polarization decomposition formula of the sgwb derived in @xcite . in section [ sec : the generalized overlap reduction function for circular polarization ] , we calculate the generalized orfs for the @xmath2 mode .",
    "the results for @xmath3 mode are consistent with the previous work  @xcite . in section [ sec : separation method ] , we give a method for separation between the @xmath3 mode and @xmath2 mode of the sgwb .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion . in appendixes , we present analytic results for the generalized overlap reduction functions . in this paper",

    "any @xmath12 hermitian matrix can be expanded by the pauli and the unit matrices with real coefficients .",

    "thus , we can rewrite the stokes parameters - as @xmath22 from the above expression , we see that the real parameter @xmath2 characterizes the asymmetry of circular polarization amplitudes .",
    "the other parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 have additional information about linear polarizations by analogy with the electromagnetic cases .",
    "alternatively , we can also define the tensor @xmath25 in circular polarization bases @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "note that the stokes parameters satisfy a relation @xmath28    next , we consider the transformation of the stokes parameters under rotations around the @xmath5 axis . the rotation around the @xmath5 axis is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the angle of the rotation .",
    "the gws traveling in the direction @xmath5 @xmath31 transform as @xmath32 where we took the transverse traceless gauge @xmath33 after a short calculation , we obtain @xmath34 using and , the four stokes parameters ( [ sti])-([stv ] ) transform as @xmath35 as you can see , the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 depend on the rotation angle @xmath30 .",
    "this reflects the fact that @xmath23 and @xmath24 parameters characterize linear polarizations .",
    "note that this transformation is similar to the transformation of electromagnetic case except for the angle @xmath36 and can be rewritten as @xmath37",
    "in this section , we study anisotropic distribution of sgwb and focus on the detectability of circular polarizations with pulsar timing arrays .",
    "we combine the analysis of @xcite and that of @xcite . in sec.[subsec : the spectral ] , we derive the power spectral density for anisotropic circularly polarized sgwb @xmath38 .",
    "then we also derive the dimensionless density parameter @xmath39 which is expressed by the frequency spectrum of intensity @xmath40  @xcite . in sec.[subsec : the signal ] , we extend the generalized orfs to cases with circular polarizations characterized by the parameter @xmath2 . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider specific anisotropic patterns with @xmath41 expressed by the spherical harmonics @xmath42 .      in the transverse traceless gauge , metric perturbations @xmath43 with a given propagation direction @xmath44",

    "however , they are not isotropic and unpolarized .",
    "the ensemble average of fourier amplitudes can be written as @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 here , the bracket @xmath65 represents an ensemble average , and @xmath66 is the dirac delta function on the two - sphere .",
    "the gw power spectral density @xmath38 is a hermitian matrix , and satisfies @xmath67 because of the relation @xmath46 .",

    "we further assume that the sgwbs satisfy @xmath69 we also assume the directional dependence of the sgwb is frequency independent @xcite .",
    "this implies the gw power spectral density is factorized into two parts , one of which depends on the direction while the other depends on the frequency .",
    "because of the transformations - , the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 have spin 0 and the parameters @xmath70 have spin @xmath71  @xcite . to analyze the sgwb on the sky , it is convenient to expand the stokes parameters by spherical harmonics @xmath72",
    ". however , since @xmath70 parameters have spin @xmath71 , they have to be expanded by the spin - weighted harmonics @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath74 in this paper , we study specific anisotropic patterns with @xmath41 for simplicity .",
    "therefore , we can neglect @xmath23 and @xmath24 from now on .",
    "thus , the gw power spectral density becomes @xmath75 where @xmath76 so , we focus on the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in what follows , we will use the following shorthand notation @xmath77    next , we consider the dimensionless density parameter  @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the critical density , @xmath80 is the present value of the hubble parameter , @xmath81 is the energy density of gravitational waves , and @xmath82 is the energy density in the frequency range @xmath48 to @xmath83 .",

    ", we assumed the ergodicity , namely , the ensemble average can be replaced by the temporal average .",
    "using , , , as well as @xmath46 and @xmath86 , we get @xmath87 then we define @xmath88 hence , the dimensionless quantity @xmath39 in is given by @xmath89 where the spherical harmonics are orthogonal and normalized as @xmath90 using @xmath91 , we obtain @xmath92 without loss of generality , we normalize the monopole moment as @xmath93 so , becomes @xmath94      the time of arrival of radio pulses from the pulsar is affected by gws .",
    "consider a pulsar with frequency @xmath95 located in the direction @xmath96 . to detect the sgwb ,",
    "let us consider the redshift of the pulse from a pulsar @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a frequency detected at the earth and @xmath96 is the direction to the pulsar .",
    "the unit vector @xmath44 represents the direction of propagation of gravitational plane waves .",
    "we also defined the difference between the metric perturbations at the pulsar @xmath99 and at the earth @xmath100 as @xmath101 the gravitational plane waves at each point is defined as @xmath102 for the sgwb , the redshift have to be integrated over the direction of propagation of the gravitational waves @xmath44 : @xmath103 we choose a coordinate system @xmath104 and assume that the amplitudes of the metric perturbation at the pulsar and the earth are the same .",
    "then becomes @xmath105 and therefore , reads @xmath106 where we have defined the pattern functions for pulsars @xmath107 note that our convention for the fourier transformation is @xmath108 therefore , the fourier transformation of can be written as @xmath109    in the actual signals from a pulsar , there exist noises .",
    "hence , we need to use the correlation analysis .",
    "we consider the signals from two pulsars @xmath110 where @xmath111 labels the pulsar . here",
    ", @xmath112 denotes the signal from the pulsar and @xmath113 denotes the noise intrinsic to the measurement .",
    "we assume the noises are stationary , gaussian and are not correlated between the two pulsars .",
    "to correlate the signals of two measurements , we define @xmath114 where @xmath1 is the total observation time and @xmath115 is a real filter function which should be optimal to maximize signal - to - noise ratio . in the case of interferometer",
    ", the optimal filter function falls to zero for large @xmath116 compered to the travel time of the light between the detecters .",
    "since the signals of two detectors are expected to correlate due to the same effect of the gravitational waves , the optimal filter function should behave this way .",
    "then , typically one of the detectors is very close to the other compared to the total observation time @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the total observation time @xmath1 can be extended to @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the case of pta , it is invalid that @xmath1 is very large compered to the travel time of the light between the pulsars .",
    "nevertheless , we can assume that one of the two @xmath1 can be expanded to @xmath117 , because in situations @xmath118 and @xmath119 it is known that we can ignore the effect of the distance @xmath120 of pulsars .",
    "in this case , it is clear that any locations of the pulsars are optimal and optimal filter function should behave like as the interferometer case @xcite .    using these assumptions @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we can rewrite as @xmath121 where @xmath122 note that @xmath123 satisfies @xmath124 , because @xmath125 is real .",
    "moreover , to deal with the unphysical region @xmath126 we require @xmath127 .",
    "thus , @xmath123 becomes real .",

    ". then we have assumed @xmath118 and @xmath119 , this assumption implies that approximately becomes @xmath133 due to the rapid oscillation of the phase factor .",
    "therefore , the distance @xmath120 of the pulsars does not appear in the generalized orfs , and hence the generalized orfs do not depend on the frequency .    as you can see from ,",
