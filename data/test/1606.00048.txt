    "protein aggregation is linked to neuro - degenerative afflictions such as alzheimer s and parkinson s disease . @xcite",
    "another classic example of a linearly self - assembling system is the polymerization of actin fibrils and microtubules in living cells that help cells to control their mechanics .",
    "@xcite it is the importance of the aggregation of proteins in a wider biological context that has motivated many theoreticians and experimentalits to study equilibrium @xcite and kinetic aspects of it .",
    "@xcite although decades of theoretical and experimental investigation has contributed to deeper understanding of how proteins self - assemble into polymer - like objects _ in vitro _ , relatively little is known as to what happens _ in vivo _ , that is , at the cellular scale .",
    "almost all of the theoretical work is restricted to using deterministic rate equations to study the kinetics of linear self - assembly .",
    "even experimentally , studying stochasticity in protein aggregation turns out to be challenging .",
    "@xcite this is because given the mesoscopic nature of the biology of the cell , the stochasticity is arguably mainly due to statistical number fluctuations of assemblies of a certain size .",
    "as cells are small in volume ( pico litre to femto litre ) , the number of molecules aggregating is also relatively small , that is , on the scale of typical _ in vitro _",
    "experiments , causing fluctuations to play a significant role in the kinetics as well as in equilibrium .",
    "the latter expresses itself in large deviations from mean length distributions .",
    "@xcite    the kinetics of self - assembly of protein monomers into polydisperse polymer - like objects , i.e. , the time evolution of the polymer length distribution , can take place via a host of different molecular pathways .",
    "examples include _ monomer addition and removal _ , _ scission and recombination",
    "_ , _ secondary nucleation _ and so on , see fig",
    "@xcite in principle , all these pathways are active during the time course of aggregation , but the predominance of one or more pathways may depend on the specific chemistry of a particular system . due to the highly nonlinear nature of the dynamical equations that describe these pathways ,",
    "it is extremely difficult to study the kinetics of even a single pathway analytically , let alone a combination of several of them . to study the _ stochastic _ nature of self - assembly , one would be required to include the effects of thermal noise that might depend on a plethora of rate constants and thermodynamic parameters .",
    "@xcite deducing the properties of the noise from microscopic rate equations , i.e. , by making use of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , is not trivial , again due to the complexity of the involvement of multiple molecular pathways .",
    "all of the above - mentioned challenges limits the applicability of analytical tools available to study the kinetics of protein aggregation .",
    "@xcite    given the challenges and limitations of the rate - equations approach , we study in this work the kinetics of nucleated linear self - assembly using the method of kinetic monte carlo , hereafter referred to as kmc .",
    "kmc is a computer simulation technique used to study markov processes .",
    "@xcite protein aggregation can be cast in to the form of a markov process , where a monomer becomes a dimer , a dimer becomes a trimer , and so on .",
    "this is exactly the same principle on which rate - equation approaches are based upon .",
    "the advantage of kmc is that it is inherently stochastic and hence we do not need to know the nature of thermal noise _ a priori_. in fact , the results obtained from this technique can be used to characterise this kind of noise and its dependence on the model parameters .",
    "stochastic simulation techniques have been widely employed to study colloidal aggregation kinetics .",
    "@xcite colloidal aggregation resembles protein self - assembly closely in terms of the governing rate equations . the characteristic feature of a lag phase present in nucleated self - assembly has also been found in computational studies of reversible colloidal aggregation .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we explore the stochastic nature of the kinetics of protein polymerization in small volumes , and study the effect of statistical number fluctuations .",
    "we study the aggregation kinetics for small volumes not for one pathway but for no fewer than nine of them discussed in more detail in section ii .",
    "the pathways we consider are _ end evaporation and addition _",
    "@xcite , _ scission and recombination _",
    "@xcite , _ secondary nucleation _",
    "@xcite , _ two - stage nucleation _ @xcite , and combination thereof . for the _ scission and recombination _ molecular pathway ,",
    "the forward and backward rate constants in principle depend on the length of the polymer chains . hence",
    ", to probe the impact of length - dependent rate constants , we use hill s model . @xcite although hill s model is valid only for long rigid rod like polymers , we neverthless use it to study if any kind of length dependence of the rate constants can alter the scaling of the lag time with system volume . to quantify the stochastic behavior of the polymerization kinetics , we focus specifically on the lag time associated with the time evolution of the polymerized mass fraction .",
    "we provide the simulation details in section iii . in section iv , by doing an exhaustive study for various combinations of molecular pathway , we show that the lag time for the polymerized mass fraction is inversely proportional to the system size in the limit of large volumes albeit that there are corrections to that , that do depend on the specific assembly pathway .",
    "@xcite finally , in section v , we conclude the article and discuss our main findings .",
    "the molecular pathway determines the relevant time scales in reversible polymerization kinetics .",
    "@xcite hence , if we are interested in the stochastic kinetics of the protein aggregation , it makes sense to study the system size dependence of a variety of molecular pathways . in this work",
    "we choose the most widely accepted and dominant kinetic pathways as far as the study of protein polymerization is concerned .",
    "@xcite we focus on ( i ) _ end evaporation and addition _ , ( ii ) _ scission and recombination _ , ( iii ) _ monomer - dependent secondary nucleation _ , and ( iv ) _ two - stage nucleation _ , and combinations of these pathways . in our description , all these reaction pathways have two things in common , which is that they all are nucleated with nucleus size @xmath0 and that they are _ reversible_. primary nucleation is thought of as the coming together of a minimum of @xmath0 monomers to form the smallest stable polymer .    of these pathways seemingly the most obvious",
    "to consider is that of _ end evaporation and addition _ , given the linear structure of the aggregates of proteins . in it ,",
    "growth or shrinkage of an aggregate is possible only by adding or removing a single monomer from either end .",
    "@xcite although _ end evaporation and addition _ is the most plausible choice to describe the kinetics of the evolution of length distributions of aggregates , fragmentation and recombination of polymers must be important if the self - assembly is nucleated . for a nucleated self - assembling system ,",
    "the _ end evaporation and addition _ pathway requires each polymer formed to cross a nucleation barrier , which slows down the assembly process significantly .",
    "instead , in _ scission and recombination _ kinetics the polymers can bypass the nucleation barrier by breaking already existing filaments and creating new nucleation centers that then can grow .",
    "hence , it is sensible to study scission - recombination in combination with end evaporation and addition , which is why this is one of the combined schemes that we investigate .",
    "the forward and backward rate constants for all pathways could be length dependent , in particular for the scission - recombination pathway . indeed",
    ", shorter polymers should recombine faster than longer ones if the reaction is diffusion limited , and longer ones plausibly have a higher probability of breaking within a certain amount of time than shorter ones .",
    "we do take into account the length dependence of the rate constants for the _ scission and recombination _ pathway by invoking hill s rate constants .",
    "@xcite hill derived the forward and backward rate constants in the limit of diffusion - limited aggregation that are valid only for long rigid rods .",
    "hill s rate constants are not entirely consistent with the thermodynamics of nucleated self - assembly , and alternative ones have been derived in the context of the radical polymerization with more accurate length dependent rate constants these seem to suffer from the same problem .",
    "@xcite as our aim is to find out if any kind of length dependence of the rate constants alters the dominant scaling of the lag time as a function of system volume , we make an arbitrary choice of using hill s model .",
    "we study both kinds of scission - recombination pathway , i.e. , with and without length dependence of the rate constants .",
    "the pathways of _ end evaporation and addition _ and of _ scission and recombination _ have proven to apply to the polymerisation of actin and tubulin filaments , but the time scales obtained from these pathways can not explain other types of protein aggregation , such as that of sickle hemoglobin .",
    "@xcite sickle cell hemoglobin shows relatively rapid polymerization kinetics in comparison to predictions from _ end evaporation and addition _ and _ scission and recombination _ kinetics . to successfully explain the rapid polymerization observed in sickle cell hemoglobin , surface - catalysed or secondary nucleation has been included in several studies .",
    "@xcite secondary nucleation is also found to be relevant in the context of amyloid fibrillation .",
    "@xcite recalling that primary nucleation concerns the conversion of a cluster of monomers into a stable polymer of shortest length , @xcite in secondary nucleation a critical number @xmath0 of monomers may first form an unstable cluster that next transforms into a stable cluster , which in turn facilitates the elongation process .    clearly , molecules may polymerize via a combination of molecular pathways . in this work",
    "we perform an exhaustive study of stochastic aggregation kinetics allowing for several combinations of pathway , and study how the resulting kinetics are affected by the system size .",
    "the pathways we study are listed in table i. mathematically , reversible polymerization can be represented by an infinite set of rate equations for all allowed chemical reactions .",
    "indeed , a monomer reacts with a monomer to form a dimer , a dimer reacts with a monomer to form a trimer and so on .",
    "let us first translate each pathway of table i into a set of chemical reactions and write the corresponding rate equation for the polymers as     state given the present state @xmath1 & reaction rate + primary nucleation &    &    .possible molecular aggregation steps by which a polymer length distribution can change , considered in this work .",
    "assuming the present state to be @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of monomers and @xmath4 the number of polymers of length @xmath5 , the states following the corresponding reactions are indicated .",
    "notice that for secondary nucleation we do not have a backward reaction .",
    "this is because @xmath6 is a polymer of size greater than the stable nucleus of size @xmath0 , that then can disintegrate via monomer removal or scission .",
    "also note that for two - stage nucleation we also have to track the evolution of unstable aggregate @xmath7 .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     & 0.02 +",
    "in this work we study by means of kinetic monte carlo simulation the stochastic nature of nucleated linearly self - assembling molecular building blocks in dilute solution .",
    "one of the models that we invoke is the thermodynamically consistent _ end evaporation and addition _ , also known as the oosawa model for self - assembly . @xcite",
    "another also includes _ scission and recombination _ , with and without allowing for explicit length dependent rate constants .",
    "@xcite we in addition allow for ( i ) monomolecular primary nucleation , ( ii ) bimolecular primary nucleation , ( iii ) secondary nucleation of monomers on already existing fibers and ( iv ) two - stage nucleation .",
    "@xcite in combination , nine different sets of pathways are studied .",
    "we show that irrespective of the combination of pathways we study , to leading order the stochastic component of the lag time is inversely proportional to the system volume .",
    "this scaling remains unchanged even when hill s length dependent rate constants , valid for rigid long polymer chains , are adapted in kinetic pathways .",
    "the first order correction that depends logarithmically on the volume turns out strongly pathway dependent . by comparing our lag time with the corresponding nucleation time to form the first nucleus , we show that for all tested pathways the stochastic component of the lag time must be a combination of a nucleation time and an elongation time .",
    "the nucleation time , unlike the lag time , is rather precisely inversely proportional to the system volume .",
    "we find it to be exponentially distributed for all system volumes , which is not the case for the lag time .",
    "the elongation time , on the other hand , strongly depends on whether the pathway involves only _ end evaporation and addition _ or in addition _ scission and recombination _ kinetics .",
    "this leads us to infer that a contribution from the elongation time is the cause of the non - universal correction to the leading order stochastic lag time .",
    "finally , we find that in the thermodynamic limit the mean lag time is non - zero whilst the mean nucleation time seems to vanish .",
    "consequently , for linearly self - assembling systems , the rate limiting step in the lag phase in that limit must be found in the elongation phase , not in the nucleation phase .",
    "we thank thomas michaels ( university of cambridge ) for stimulating discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the nederlandse organisatie voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek through project no .",
    "we invoke the gillespie algorithm to simulate our system of linearly self - assembling particles .",
    "@xcite let us consider a state of the system as @xmath8 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the numbers of monomers and of polymer of length @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the self - assembly as described by the molecular aggregation pathways shown in table i , can be seen as a markov process . in a markov process",
    "the transition from the current state to the next state via one of the reactions shown in table i depends on the current state of the system , and not on the states before that . as",
    "a first step towards implementing the gillespie algorithm to study reaction kinetics is to list out all the possible reactions , given the current state of the system with their corresponding reaction rates .",
    "given the current state of the system @xmath8 , the gillespie algorithm in essence requires two quantities : i ) from all possible reactions listed in table i , given the current state of the system , determine the next reaction that is going to take place in the time bracket from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "ii ) calculate @xmath12 the time that one of the reactions from table i will happen for the first time .    to find next possible reaction",
    ", we first have to transform the reaction rates for each reaction of table i into the corresponding probability .",
    "let us define the rate to leave the present state , i.e. , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the reaction rate for each individual reaction @xmath15 .",
    "the probability of reaction @xmath15 with reaction rate @xmath14 is given by @xmath16 .",
    "next , we generate a uniformly distributed random number , @xmath17 , in the interval @xmath18 and find the next possible reaction @xmath15 , such that , @xmath19 , where @xmath15 is the reaction that is going to happen next .",
    "the second quantity , i.e. , the time @xmath12 for next reaction to happen turns out to be exponentially distributed , typical of first passage processes .",
    "@xcite this then by simple transformation can be related to a uniform distribution . to calculate @xmath12 we",
    "can then generate a uniformly distributed random number @xmath20 , in the interval @xmath18 and using the relation @xmath21 . this way , at every instance we know the next micro - state of the system and the time it will take for transition from the current to the next state of the system .",
    "this combination gives us the time evolution of the length distribution of the polymer self - assembly . by generating appropriate random numbers we also take into account the stochasticity coming from the mesoscopic number fluctuations .",
    "hence , the gillespie algorithm provides us with a tool to study stochastic kinetics arising from the reaction rate kinetics of self - assembling systems .",
    "we obtain closed - form differential equations for the first two moments of a generalized pathway consisting of _ primary nucleation _ , _ end evaporation and addition _ and _",

    "<S> protein aggregation is of great importance in biology , e.g. , in amyloid fibrillation . </S>",
    "<S> the aggregation processes that occur at the cellular scale must be highly stochastic in nature because of the statistical number fluctuations that arise on account of the small system size at the cellular scale . </S>",
    "<S> we study the nucleated reversible self - assembly of monomeric building blocks into polymer - like aggregates using the method of kinetic monte carlo . </S>",
    "<S> kinetic monte carlo , being inherently stochastic , allows us to study the impact of fluctuations on the polymerisation reactions . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important characteristic features in this kind of problem is the existence of a lag phase before self - assembly takes off , which is what we focus attention on . </S>",
    "<S> we study the associated lag time as a function of the system size and kinetic pathway . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the leading order stochastic contribution to the lag time before polymerisation commences is inversely proportional to the system volume for large - enough system size for all nine reaction pathways tested . </S>",
    "<S> finite - size corrections to this do depend on the kinetic pathway . </S>"
