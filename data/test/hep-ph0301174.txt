    "recently , the three body charmful decays @xmath1 were first observed by the belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "they also found a novel phenomenon that the mass spectra of the @xmath2 pair peaks near their mass threshold . in @xcite , a factorization approach which extends the conventional ( or say , naive ) factorization approach in b - meson two body decays @xcite was proposed to study @xmath3 decays .",
    "the transition matrix element of @xmath0 is factorized into a @xmath4 form factor multiplied by a @xmath5 weak form factor .",
    "the @xmath5 form factor is constrained from the experimental data for the time - like electromagnetic ( em ) kaon form factors .",
    "the branching ratios obtained in this approach agree with the experiment .",
    "the phenomenological success indicates that the generalized factorization assumption may be valid as the leading approximation of an asymptotic expansion .",
    "the purpose of this study is to establish a theoretical foundation of the factorization for b - meson multi - body decays , in particular for @xmath6 decays in qcd .",
    "the factorization approach for the non - leptonic , two body b - meson decays had been used for a long time @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that a hadronic matrix element of the four - quark operator is factorized into a multiplication of two simpler matrix elements which one is represented by a form factor and another by a decay constant .",
    "an argument based on  color transparency \" was proposed as a mechanism of the factorization @xcite .",
    "the qcd factorization method develops the naive factorization into a rigorous and systematic framework @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient is factorization , the separation of perturbative from non - perturbative dynamics , a standard method in perturbative qcd for the hard exclusive processes @xcite .",
    "the naive factorization approach is its lowest order ( the strong coupling constant @xmath7 ) approximation .",
    "a proof of factorization at two - loop order in @xmath8 decays is given by using the methods of momentum regions and ward identities .",
    "the all - orders proof is done in the recently developed soft - collinear effective theory @xcite .",
    "the proof of factorization in the soft - collinear effective theory has several advantages : the explicit gauge invariance at the classical level can be utilized ; the operator language is simpler than the diagrammatic analysis ; the separation of the perturbative from the non - perturbative dynamics is easily done in effective theory because they occur at disparate energy scales .",
    "we will use the soft - collinear effective theory to give a proof of factorization for @xmath0 decays .",
    "the exclusive , non - leptonic three body b meson decays are usually more complicate than two body case .",
    "however , the hadronic physics of @xmath0 decays in the heavy quark limit ( the heavy quark mass @xmath9 ) may be simpler because the final kaon pair has small invariant mass .",
    "it is well - known in qcd that the large energy behavior of hadron form factor satisfies a dimensional counting rule @xcite .",
    "consequently , the probability of kaon pair production at large invariant mass is suppressed by powers of large energy .",
    "this phenomenon is called the from factor suppression .",
    "thus the dominant contribution comes from the region with small invariant mass . for the production of kaon pair at small invariant mass ,",
    "it is analogous to the production mechanism of two pions in the process @xmath10 with high virtual photons and small invariant mass of pion pair @xcite . according to this mechanism ,",
    "@xmath5 mesons are produced by the hadronization of @xmath11 pair emitted from the w - boson and can be described by a universal , non - perturbative matrix element which generalizes the standard description of a hadron in qcd @xcite .",
    "the new element is generalized distribution amplitude(s ) which is the crossed version of of the generalized parton distribution ( gpd ) of hadron @xcite .    in the small invariant mass region ,",
    "the two kaons are nearly collinear and energetic .",
    "thus , the argument of  color transparency \" is applicable .",
    "since the @xmath11 pair moves fast , time dilation effect makes the hadronization of kaon pair can not occur until the @xmath11 pair moves far away from the remaining system .",
    "the transition @xmath12 with a small invariant mass is soft and is described by a generalized distribution amplitude of kaon pair . for the @xmath4 transition , the light spectator does not require a hard interaction because b and d mesons are both heavy .",
    "the energetic and collinear @xmath11 pair in a color - singlet configuration decouples from the soft gluon interactions .",
    "so , the strong interactions between @xmath5 and @xmath13 systems occur at short distance and can be systematically calculated in perturbative qcd .",

    "we will use the position space formulation in @xcite to demonstrate factorization .",
    "we also include discussions on the suppression of higher - fock states and endpoint contributions based on the power counting of the soft - collinear effective theory .",

    "the low energy effective field theories relevant to our process are heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and soft - collinear effective theory .",

    "the small expansion parameter should be @xmath57 ( for the @xmath58 quark mass , we assume that it is at the same order of @xmath59 quark mass @xmath60 ) .",
    "the wilson lines are indispensable elements in hqet and scet .",
    "the soft wilson line @xmath61 and collinear wilson line @xmath62 are very useful to give a gauge - invariant quantities .",

    "the definition of wilson lines and the power counting for the scet fields are given in @xcite .",
    "the coupling of soft gluons to collinear quark is a bit complicated . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors introduce auxiliary fields and integrate out the off - shell modes ( @xmath65 . the soft wilson line is obtained at the current level . in @xcite , an approach which is similar to the hqet is used to decouple the soft gluon from the collinear quark .",
    "the two approaches give the same results in leading order of @xmath66 .",
    "we adopt the approach in @xcite that the collinear quark field transforms as @xmath67 under the soft gluon interactions . for heavy quark , @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath69 represents that the soft gluons go along the @xmath70 direction .",

    "the coupling of collinear gluon to the heavy quark leads to off - shellness of order @xmath71 which needs to be integrated from the effective theory .",
    "the tree level matching gives collinear wilson lines which can be represented in a gauge - invariant form as @xmath63 . at the loop level matching",

    "it is found that hard - soft momentum region contribution does not cancel at two - loop order @xcite and can be absorbed in the definition of the @xmath4 transition form factor .    for @xmath85 decays ,",
    "the next step is to prove that the soft gluons which attach the collinear quarks decouple and then cancel .",
    "this cancelation occurs for both the non - factorizable and factorizable diagrams for soft gluons . here",

    ", the case is different .",
    "the non - factorizbale soft gluons decouple from the collinear fields and vanish due to unitarity of the soft wilson line @xmath88 for color - singlet current operator .",
    "but , the factorizable soft gluons does not cancel completely because the kaon pair system contains the valence @xmath89 quarks as well as a lot of see quarks and gluons with soft momenta of order of @xmath15 .",
    "the non - cancelation of soft dynamics is similar to @xmath4 transitions where the interactions with the spectator quark in b meson are soft dominant .",
    "so the qcd dynamics of kaon pair is not collinear dominant as the single kaon or pion .",
    "however , the non - cancelation of soft interactions does not break down the factorization because they occur far away from the hard interaction point .",
    "the collinear fields in eq .",

    "because the color conservation of qcd , a color - octet current can not couple to two color - singlet kaons .",
    "although some literatures discuss the possibility of color - octet contribution for heavy quarkonium , there is no indication to introduce the color - octet mechanism for light hadrons .",

    "the wilson coefficients @xmath103 are infrared finite because they are obtained by matching from the full theory onto the low energy effective theory .",
    "they do not depend on the details of the low energy dynamics .",
    "the convolution form of the factorized form is due to that both the hard coefficient function and the generalized distribution amplitude depends on the light - cone momentum fraction @xmath104 .",
    "the generalized distribution amplitude @xmath105 provides an important theoretical tool to study the production of two hadron pair .",
    "it is the time - like version of a generalized parton distribution ( gpd ) of hadron .",
    "since the study of gda in b decays is only at the start , we display some general properties of gda which is helpful to understand it .",
    "gda contains much fruitful physical information .",
    "@xmath106 depends on three variables : quark fraction @xmath107 , which describes how the current quark shares the total momentum ; hadron fraction @xmath108 , which characterizes the momentum distribution between two hadrons ; and the invariant mass @xmath18 .",
    "one special feature of gda is that it is complex in general .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath109 is due to rescattering effects or resonance contributions .",
    "the strong phase shift induced by this soft mechanism is neither power nor perturbative ( @xmath110 ) suppressed because the final state interactions between two hadrons occur at low energies .",
    "thus it gives an origin of a large strong phase . in this paper",
    ", we will not explore this point further since only the absolute value of @xmath109 is relevant .",
    "another feature of gda is that it does not select all the valence quarks of the kaon pair in the hard scattering at the quark level .",
    "the additional valence quark pair @xmath111 contained in gda plays no role in the hard scattering .",
    "the @xmath5 gda has only one isospin state , i.e. @xmath112 . for iso - vector amplitude @xmath113 , the charge conjugation invariance gives ( z , , w^2)=(1-z , , w^2)=-(z , 1- , w^2 ) .",

    "eq.([eq : normal ] ) means that the time - like form factor can be interpreted from a more general concept , namely , gda .",
    "the gda @xmath116 will depend on the renormalization scale which is at the order of @xmath71 in our case .",
    "since the scale dependence is only related to the non - local product of quark fields , the evolution of @xmath116 is the same as the bler evolution of the pion distribution amplitude @xcite . in the limit @xmath117",
    ", the gda @xmath118 has the asymptotic form @xcite ^k^-k^0(z , , w^2)=6z(1-z)(2 - 1)f^k^-k^0(w^2 ) .",
    "thus the shape of the kaon pair invariant mass spectrum in @xmath119 in the heavy quark limit is completely determined by the time - like weak form factor @xmath115 .    in the above derivation of the factorization",
    ", we have assumed that the momenta of @xmath11 quark pair are collinear and the kaon pair are dominated by the small invariant mass region .",
    "now , we argue that they are leading power contributions . the endpoint region which one quark of @xmath11 pair contains most energy while another is soft",

    "the hard coefficients contain only logarithmic dependence of @xmath104 and does not add more power of @xmath121 .",
    "for the transition pion form factor , the consistency of factorization requires the suppression of pion distribution amplitude at endpoint . the contribution from the large invariant mass of kaon pair",

    "this is the dimensional counting rule for hadron form factor at large @xmath123 @xcite . here",

    "the power counting is : collinear quark field @xmath124 , kaon meson state @xmath125 .",
    "the time - like kaon form factor is described by the matrix element of @xmath126 at large @xmath123 where the effective operator @xmath127 contains four collinear quarks associated with collinear wilson lines and dirac matrix elements in leading power .",

    "this means that the form factor @xmath115 at large invariant mass @xmath18 is proportional to @xmath130 and suppressed .",
    "this suppression is called the form factor suppression . one important phenomenon related to the form factor suppression",
    "is that the spectrum of kaon invariant mass is enhanced by its threshold region .",
    "so , the threshold enhancement of mass spectrum is crucial for the consistency of our factorization method .",
    "the higher fock - states contribute the subleading power corrections . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors use explicit calculations to show that 3-particle fock - state is suppressed by powers of @xmath131 in the heavy quark limit .",
    "this conclusion can be proved generally from the simple dimensional analysis .",

    "the scaling dimension of field is determined by its ordinary dimension . for kaon meson",
    ", we use the normalization @xmath135 to determine its dimension .",
    "adding one gluon field to the effective operators means the increase of dimension by @xmath136 , the hard coefficients must be suppressed by a power of @xmath71 in order to match the dimension of @xmath71 .",
    "specifically , we consider the gluon field @xmath137 insertion .",
    "the scaling for @xmath138 is @xmath139 , so its contribution is @xmath140 suppressed compared to the leading term .",

    "the theoretical accuracy within @xmath165 is possible to be accessible in qcd factorization method .",
    "this accuracy is not as good as that in @xmath21 , but it is still important in explaining the experimental data and understanding the hadronic physics of three body decays .",
    "the principle that the hadron pair produced through quark - antiquark pair can be applied to other three body b - meson decays , such as @xmath166 , @xmath167 etc .",
    "for these processes , more generalized distribution amplitudes are required .",
    "some studies of using gdas ( or called two - hadron distribution amplitudes ) in b decays have been considered in @xcite .",
    "the detailed exploration of this subject is also required .",
    "we would like to thank h. li and c. chua for many valuable discussions .",
