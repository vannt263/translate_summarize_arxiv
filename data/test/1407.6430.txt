    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are brief soft @xmath0ray transients powered by the dying massive stars or mergers of some compact objects . in the past decades ,",
    "tremendous advances in understanding such a kind of violent explosions have been achieved @xcite .",
    "however , the physical composition of the grb outflows ( magnetic or baryonic ) is still to be better probed . in some well - studied relativistic jets for example that in active galactic nuclei , the initial ejecta are widely believed to be poynting - flux dominated because the accretion disk is too cool to launch relativistic outflow via neutrino process ( e.g. , shao et al .",
    "however , with an accretion rate high up to @xmath3 , the accretion disk surrounding the nascent stellar - mass black hole is extremely hot and the neutrino radiation is the main cooling channel . as a result",
    "the annihilation of the neutrino and antineutrinos from the disk may be able to launch a baryonic / hot fireball @xcite .",
    "regardless of the nature of the central engine ( either a stellar - mass black hole or a magnetized pulsar ) , the magnetic activity of the central engine can launch a magnetized / cold outflow @xcite .    among the various methods of probing the physical composition of grb outflows ,",
    "one is to study the optical flash which is believed to be powered by the reverse shock generated in the interaction between the outflow and the circum - burst medium .",
    "the idea is the following .",
    "as long as the ordered magnetic field component is much stronger than the random one generated by the shocks , the reverse - shock - accelerated - electrons will radiate more efficiently and then give rise to brighter optical flash .",
    "the degree of the magnetization of the reverse shock region can be inferred from the modeling of the reverse and forward emission self - consistently @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the synchrotron radiation of electrons in ordered magnetic field is expected to be highly - polarized and hence the optical polarimetry will be a smoking - gun signal of the magnetized outflow model @xcite . the reverse shock emission model for optical flashes",
    "@xcite has been supported by the observations of a group of grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the absence of optical flashes in other grbs @xcite can be attributed to high magnetization of the outflow that can dramatically suppress the reverse shock emission @xcite .",
    "the polarimetry of the optical flashes is rather challenging .",
    "the successful polarization measurement of the a quickly - decaying optical emission of grb 090102 got a linear polarization degree @xmath4 and has been taken as the evidence for the presence of large - scale magnetic fields originating in the expanding fireball @xcite . however , a reasonable modeling of the optical and x - ray afterglow of grb 090102 in the forward and reverse shock emission scenario was found to be not achievable @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of the  quickly - decaying optical emission \" is thus less clear .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the detection of very high linear polarization degree in the early optical emission of grb 120308a . in this work",
    "we examine whether the afterglow data is in support of the reverse shock origin of the early optical emission or not .",
    "as shown later the answer is positive , hence we estimate the magnetization degree of the outflow .",
    "swift satellite triggered and located grb 120308a , a single broad pulse of @xmath5-rays , on 8th march 2012 at @xmath6 ut . the duration @xmath7 ( 15 - 350 kev ) is @xmath8 sec and the the time - averaged spectrum from @xmath9 to @xmath10 sec is best fit by a simple power - law model and the power law index of the time - averaged spectrum is @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) began observing the field at @xmath12 ut , 92.6 seconds after the bat trigger .",
    "a bright , uncatalogued and fading x - ray source was detected @xcite .",
    "the optical afterglow was detected by the liverpool telescope and other ground - based telescopes @xcite .",
    "the optical emission was so bright that time - resolved polarimetry was carried out by the liverpool telescope with the purpose - built ringo2 polarimeter . at the peak time of optical emission ,",
    "the linear polarization degree once reached @xmath13 and then declined to @xmath14 hundreds seconds later @xcite .",
    "it is a very robust detection and @xmath15 is the highest polarization degree of optical afterglow people have observed in all grbs .",
    "the straightforward interpretation of the polarization properties is that the early optical emission was dominated by the reverse shock component and the outflow had large - scale uniform fields that survives long after the initial explosion , as initially identified / speculated in grb 990123 @xcite .    in the first 300 seconds",
    "the x - ray emission was dominated by a giant x - ray flare with a peak @xmath16 kev flux @xmath17 which is most likely attributed to the prolonged activity of the central engine .",
    "the subsequent x - ray afterglow decayed with time as @xmath18 initially and then got steeper and steeper until a jet - like break appeared at @xmath19 s. the x - ray spectrum was @xmath20 @xcite for @xmath21 and got significantly softened later on . in the standard fireball model , such spectral and temporal behaviors can be understood if at early times @xmath22 and @xmath23 suppose the circum - burst medium has a constant density profile ( i.e. , the medium is ism - like rather than stellar - wind like ) , where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are the cooling frequency ( typical synchrotron radiation frequency ) of the forward shock - accelerated electrons and @xmath26 is the power - law energy distribution index of the shock - accelerated electrons . in view of the spectrum change at @xmath27",
    "s , we expect that the cooling frequency @xmath28 at that time . on the other hand , as shown in mundell et al .",
    "( 2013 ) the optical emission in the first @xmath29 s is likely dominated by a reverse shock emission component and the forward shock emission peaked at a time @xmath30 s with a flux @xmath31 mjy when @xmath25 crossed the observer s frequency @xmath32 hz . in the ism model , the maximal specific flux of the forward shock emission ( @xmath33 ) is a constant .",
    "hence we have @xmath34 .",
    "it is widely known that the forward shock emission is governed by the following physical parameters that can be parameterized as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 $ ] , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the fraction of shock energy given to the electrons ( magnetic field ) , the compton parameter @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . here and throughout this text ,",
    "the convention @xmath44 has been adopted .    as inferred from the optical and x - ray afterglow emission , we have @xmath45 kev , @xmath46 hz and @xmath47 mjy , which yield @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 where : @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    now we have four variables while only three equations",
    ". the value of these variables can not be uniquely determined and hence we express @xmath54 into the number density of the medium @xmath55 .    in the case of @xmath56 ,",
    "the term of @xmath57 can be ignored and we have @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 the dependence of all these three variables on @xmath55 is not sensitive .    in the case of @xmath61",
    ", we have @xmath62 and then have @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 are constant .",
    "comparing with the case of @xmath56 , the dependence of @xmath40 and @xmath70 is rather sensitive .    for @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    ", we have @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 and then get @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78    we have solved equations ( @xmath79 ) numerically . as shown in fig.1 , @xmath80 grows quickly while @xmath40 drops sharply for @xmath81 in the case of @xmath72 .",
    "we also calculated the grb efficiency by applying a k - correction with a reasonable factor @xmath82 .",
    "considering that for typical grb the efficiency is @xmath83 and @xmath84 , we find that the value of @xmath85 is around 0.01 for @xmath72 .",
    "as already mentioned , the early optical emission is likely due to the strong reverse shock emission and the crossing time of the reverse shock is just the peak time of the optical emission ( i.e. , @xmath86 s ) .",
    "since @xmath87 ( i.e. , the reverse shock crossed the outflow at a time much later than the end of the prompt emission ) , so the fireball is thin . on the other hand , the crossing time is usually estimated as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the initial lorentz factor of the grb outflow . since @xmath89 is very weakly dependent on @xmath90 and @xmath91 , so with the above equation we know that @xmath92 , i.e. , the initial grb outflow is ultra - relativistic .",
    "the forward - reverse shock emission has been extensively investigated . as firstly found in grb 990123",
    ", the physical parameters of the reverse shock can be dramatically different from that of the forward shock @xcite .",
    "for the reverse shock emission , we usually have @xmath93 and the ratio between the reverse shock optical emission and the forward shock peak optical emission is estimated by ( see eq.(16 ) of jin & fan ( 2007 ) ; similar expression can be found in zhang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the strength of the reverse shock emission at the crossing time ( i.e. , it is assumed that at that time the lorentz factor of the decelerating outflow is half of the initial , as found in the numerical calculations ) , and @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the fractions of reverse - shock - energy given to the electrons and magnetic field , respectively ) .",
    "on the one hand , the reverse shock emission peaked at @xmath100 and the peak flux is @xmath101 .",
    "on the other hand , the forward shock optical emission likely peaked at @xmath102 with a flux @xmath103 mjy .",
    "with eq.([eq : ratio ] ) we have @xmath104 in this work we assume that @xmath105 and thus @xmath106 for @xmath95 , i.e. , the reverse shock region contains magnetic field @xmath107 times stronger than that in the forward shock region .",
    "one reason for this assumption is that the initially outflow is orderly magnetized or alternatively the magnetic field generated in the internal - shock phase may have not been dissipated effectively in a short time and would play a dominant role in the reverse shock region . since an ordered magnetic field is highly needed to reproduce the rather high linear polarization detected in the reverse shock emission , we conclude that the initial outflow was magnetized .",
    "similar conclusion was drawn in mundell et al .",
    "however , they found a @xmath108 since the smaller @xmath109 was adopted in the estimate , based on @xcite s numerical calculation with the outflow spreading effect .",
    "let us estimate the magnetization degree of the outflow ( @xmath110 ) , supposing the magnetic filed in the reverse shock region is dominated by the ordered component .",
    "then at @xmath111 we have @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the comoving magnetic pressure in the reverse shock region while @xmath114 is the comoving thermal energy density in the forward shock region .",
    "since @xmath115 $ ] ( where @xmath116 is the adiabatic index ) , with @xmath117(u_{\\rm us}/u_{\\rm ds})(e'_{\\rm r , th}/n'_{\\rm r}m_{\\rm p}c^{2})^{-1}$ ] ( see eq.(12 ) of fan et al .",
    "( 2004b ) ) , we have @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the comoving number density of the reverse shock region , @xmath120 is the velocity of the un - shocked grb outflow relative to the surface of the reverse shock ( see fig.1(a ) of fan et al .",
    "( 2004b ) to see the result , note that the @xmath121 used in fan et al .",
    "( 2004b ) is just the current @xmath122 ) , and @xmath123 is the velocity of the shocked grb outflow relative to the surface of the reverse shock , which is calculated through the lorentz transformation , i.e. , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the velocity in the unit of the speed of light @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "now we have @xmath128 on the other hand , since @xmath129 unless the reverse shock region is magnetic energy dominated , we then have @xmath130 if @xmath131 , the above equation reduced to the form found in @xcite , i.e. , @xmath132 . for @xmath95 , the fiducial value adopted in this work",
    ", we have @xmath133 where @xmath40 is normalized to 0.002 , the value obtained in our numerical fit ( see section [ sec : num ] ) .",
    "if the outflow shell spreading effect is significant and @xmath134 , the magnetization is expected to be @xmath135 .",
    "the code used here to fit the x - ray and optical light curves has been developed by yan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , in which both the reverse and the forward shock emission have been taken into account .",
    "as already mentioned , we assume that @xmath39 and the electron spectral index @xmath26 are essentially the same for the forward shock and reverse shock , but we allow different @xmath40-values in these two regions .    the numerical results are presented in fig.2 and fig.3 , and the fitting parameters are @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the half - opening angle of the grb outflow to account for the jet break presented in both x - ray and optical data .",
    "these parameters are well consistent with that found in our analytical estimate ( see section 2.1 and 2.2 ) .",
    "the very early optical afterglow emission , in particular the bright optical flash expected in the reverse shock emission model , is very valuable to constrain the nature of the grb outflow .",
    "this is because at such early times , the outflow likely still carries some information on the magnetization of the initial outflow . if the outflow is just weakly magnetized , there are two interestingly observational signatures : ( i ) the reverse shock optical emission can be significantly brightened and then outshine the forward shock optical emission ( fan et al .",
    "2002 ; zhang et al . 2003 ) ; ( ii ) the reverse shock optical emission will be significantly polarized and a moderate / high linear polarization is expected ( granot & knigl 2003 ; fan et al .",
    "both signals have been detected in grb 120308a , which thus provide compelling evidence for the large scale ordered magnetic field in the initial grb outflow ( see also mundell et al .",
    "2013 ) . to set a tighter constraint on the magnetization of the outflow , in this work",
    "we have modeled both the x - ray and optical emission . due to the lack of",
    "radio detection / spectrum and then the absence of a reasonable estimate of synchrotron - self - absorption frequency of the forward shock , the shock parameters @xmath138 can not be uniquely determined ( see section 2.1 for the details ) .",
    "even so , if we assume a typical grb efficiency that is expected to be not smaller than @xmath4 ( note that the isotropic - equivalent @xmath0ray radiation energy of grb 120308a is @xmath139 erg ) , then we have @xmath140 ( see the numerical fit result ) .",
    "the magnetization degree of the outflow in the reverse shock region is thus @xmath141a few percent , depending on whether the outflow shell spreading effect is important or not .",
    "considering the plausible magnetic energy dissipation in both the acceleration and prompt emission phases of the grb outflow , we conclude that the afterglow data of grb 120308a provides us the compelling evidence that at least for some grbs a non - ignorable fraction of the energy was released in the form of poynting - flux .",
    "finally we would like to point out that in addition to the measurement of the synchrotron - self - absorption frequency in radio bands , the degeneracy between the shock parameters @xmath138 can also be broken by the observation of the synchrotron - self - compton gev - tev emission together with the optical and x - ray data because the synchrotron - self - compton parameter @xmath142 is also related to these shock parameters , too . in view of these possibilities ,",
    "we urge the multi - wavelength afterglow ( radio , optical , x - ray and hard @xmath0ray ) observations of the grbs with early optical polarimetry information .",
