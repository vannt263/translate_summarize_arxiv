    "quark stars have been characterized by soft equations of state , since the asymptotic freedom of quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) tells us that as energy scale goes higher , the interaction between quarks will become weaker .",
    "in fact , the simplest and most widely used model for quark stars , the mit bag model , treats the quarks inside a quark star as relativistic and weak - interaction particles which are confined inside the star by an additional pressure denoted by the bag constant  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , in cold quark matter at realistic baryon densities of compact stars ( with an average value of @xmath3 ) , the energy scale is far from the region where the asymptotic freedom approximation could apply , so the the ground state of realistic quark matter might not be that of fermi gas  ( see a discussion given by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the interaction between quarks inside a quark star could make quarks to condensate in position space to form quark clusters  @xcite , and at low enough temperature the quark - clusters could crystallize even to form a solid state of quark stars .",
    "solid quark stars still can not be ruled out in both astrophysics and particle physics  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is really a difficult task to obtain a realistic state equation of cold quark matter at a few nuclear densities , because of ( i ) the non - perturbative effect of the strong interaction between quarks at low energy scale and ( ii ) the many - body problem of vast assemblies of interacting particles .",
    "however , it is still meaningful for us to consider some phenomenological models to explore the properties of quarks at the low energy scale . in the earlier work , we tried two models ; one is the polytropic quark star model  @xcite which establishes a general framework for modeling quark stars , and the other one is the lennard - jones quark matter model  @xcite which introduces a specific kind of interactions in quark stars . both of the models are much different from the conventional ones ( e.g. , mit bag model ) . in the former case",
    "the quark - clusters are non - relativistic particles , whereas in the the latter case quarks are relativistic particles .",
    "consequently , the equations of state in our two phenomenological models could be stiffer than that in conventional quark star models , and then lead to larger maximum masses for quark stars . under some reasonable parameters ,",
    "the maximum mass could be higher than 2 @xmath4",
    ". there could be some other models for the clustered cold quark matter .",
    "@xcite adopted a two - gaussian component soft - core potential and also found the parameter space in which the maximum mass could be higher than 2 @xmath4 .",
    "recently , radio observations of a binary millisecond pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 , which show a strong shapiro delay signature , imply that the pulsar mass is 1.97@xmath50.04 @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "although this high mass could rule out conventional quark star models ( whose equations of state are soft ) and normal neutron stars with hyperon or boson condensation cores , the solid quark star model still can not be ruled out , because a solid quark star could reach such high mass without suffering the gravitational instability . certainly , besides equation of state , the highest mass would also be meaningful for researches of @xmath6-ray bursts ( grbs ) and gravitational waves  @xcite since grb x - ray flares may originate from massive millisecond pulsars produced by compact star mergers  @xcite . in this note , to constrain the parameters in solid quark stars by the newly discovered high mass pulsar , we take the lennard - jones model to describe the state of could quark matter in quark stars  @xcite , and present the parameter space which can be allowed by pulsars with mass higher than @xmath0 .",
    "we find that if the number of quarks in one quark - cluster @xmath7 satisfies @xmath8 , then there is enough parameter space for the existence of quark stars with masses to be higher than @xmath0 .",
    "we also find that the results are consistent with the constraint imposed by non - atomic spectrum of pulsars .",
    "quark clustering could occur in cold quark matter because of the strong coupling between quarks at realistic baryon densities of compact stars .",
    "the number of quarks in one quark - cluster , @xmath7 , is an important parameter , because it is closely relevant to the strong interaction between quarks . to derive the properties of cold quark matter from qcd calculations is very difficult ; however , on the other hand , the astrophysical observations of pulsar - like compact stars provide us effective tools to give constrains on the phenomenological models of cold quark matter .",
    "the constrains by non - atomic spectrum of x - ray observations of pulsar - like compact stars and by the @xmath0 psr j1614 - 2230 can give us consistent results on the allowed range of @xmath7 .",
    "strange quark matter is composed of up , down and strange quarks , as well as electrons to maintain the charge - neutrality . in mit bag model ,",
    "the number of electrons per baryon @xmath9 is found for different strange quarks mass @xmath10 and coupling constant @xmath11  @xcite . in their results ,",
    "when @xmath12 , @xmath9 is less than @xmath13 ; a larger @xmath11 means a smaller @xmath9 at fixed @xmath10 , because the interaction between quarks will lead to more strange quarks and consequently less electrons . in our model , we also consider the strong interaction between quarks as well as between quark - clusters , and consequently the required number of electrons per baryon to guarantee the neutrality should be also be very small . although at the present stage we have not got the exactly value for the number density of electrons , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath9 is less than @xmath13 .    making an analogy between quark - clusters to nuclei",
    ", the non - atomic spectrum of pulsar - like compact stars can give us some implies about the positive electric charge of an quark - cluster .",
    "the @xmath14 line is the strongest line among all the emission lines of an atom , whose energy is written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of positive charge of the nucleus .",
    "similarly , taking @xmath16 as the number of positive charge of one quark - cluster , from above equation we can get the energy needed for quark - clusters to emit @xmath14 line .",
    "the temperature of a quark star is about 100@xmath171000 ev , then @xmath18 should be satisfied , otherwise there could be @xmath14 line which is thermally produced . consequently ,",
    "if @xmath19 for each quark - cluster ( note that the baryon number of one quark is 1/3 ) , then @xmath20 is required .      in the lennard - jones",
    "quark matter model  @xcite , the interaction potential @xmath21 between two quark - clusters as the function of their distance @xmath22 is assumed to be described by the lennard - jones potential  @xcite @xmath23,\\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the depth of the potential and @xmath25 can be considered as the range of interaction .",
    "it is worth noting that the property of short - distance repulsion and long - distance attraction presented by lennard - jones potential is also a characteristic of the interaction between nuclei .",
    "although the form of interaction between quark - clusters is difficult for us to derive due to the non - perturbative effect of qcd , we could adopt the potential in eq.([1 ] ) because of its general features . like",
    "the classical solid , if the inter - cluster potential is deep enough to trap the clusters in the potential wells , the quark matter would crystallize and form solid quark stars .    under such potential , we can get the equation of state , including the contribution of the lattice vibration inside solid quark stars , and then derive the mass - radius curves by integrate numerically from the center to the surface of the star  @xcite .",
    "in addition , because of the strong interaction , the surface density @xmath26 should be non - zero .",
    "the maximum mass of quark stars depends on parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and the number of quarks inside one quark - cluster @xmath7 .",
    "given the density of quark matter @xmath27 and the mass of each individual quark , from heisenberg s uncertainty relation we can approximate the kinetic energy of one cluster as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the nuclear matter density . to get the quark - clusters trapped in the potential wells to form lattice structure , @xmath24 should be larger than the kinetic energy of quarks .",
    "because of the strong interaction between quarks , we adopt @xmath24=10 mev and 200 mev to do the calculations",
    ". the surface density @xmath25 should be between 1 to 3 @xmath29 , to ensure quark - deconfinement without exceeding the average density for a typical pulsar .",
    "we choose @xmath30 in the calculations .",
    "the minor chance of @xmath26 would not chace the results qualitatively . in addition",
    ", we note that for a given @xmath26 , we can get @xmath25 at the surface where the pressure is zero , so there are only three independent parameters , @xmath24 , @xmath26 and @xmath7 , which determine the maximum mass of quark stars .",
    "we show relation between the maximum mass of quark stars ( @xmath31 ) and the depth of potential ( @xmath24 ) when @xmath30 , for some different cases of @xmath7 , in fig.1 .     on @xmath24 ( depth of potential well ) , for some different cases of @xmath7 ( number of quarks inside one quark - cluster ) , in lennard - jones cold quark matter model .",
    "the surface density @xmath26 is chosen to be 2 times of @xmath29 ( the nuclear matter density ) .",
    "if @xmath2 , there is enough parameter space for the existence of quark stars with mass larger than 2 @xmath4 .",
    "[ r],width=3 ]    we can see that if @xmath2 , there is enough parameter space for the existence of quark stars with mass larger than 2 @xmath4 .",
    "the case @xmath32 should be ruled out by the discovery of psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "this constrain of @xmath7 by the maximum mass of pulsars is consistent with that by the non - atomic spectrum of pulsars ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "fig.1 also shows that @xmath33 is insensitive to @xmath24 .",
    "this is understandable , because the repulsive core of the inter - cluster potential reacts in most part of the dense cold quark matter inside a quark star , and @xmath24 only reacts near the star s surface where the density is low enough for one cluster to fell the depth of the potential well of a nearby cluster .",
    "furthermore , it could imply that the constraint of @xmath33 on @xmath7 is insensitive to the form of inter - cluster potential , as long as the potential has a strong repulsive core at short distance .",
    "the newly discovered high mass pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 with mass @xmath34 still can not rule out the existence of quark stars , because quark could be clustered in realistic cold quark matter at supra - nuclear density and then stiff equations of state are possible .",
    "we take the lennard - jones quark matter model to calculate the maximum masses of quark stars , finding that if @xmath2 , there is enough parameter space for the existence of quark stars with masses to be higher than 2 @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , this constraint on @xmath7 could shows generality for clustered quark matter , insensitive to the form of inter - cluster potential ."
