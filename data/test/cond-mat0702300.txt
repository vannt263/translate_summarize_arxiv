    "processes involving electrostatic interactions often play a dominant role in biological and soft - matter systems @xcite . in aqueous environments charges on macromolecular surfaces such as",
    "membranes , self - assembled micelles , globular proteins and fibrous polysaccharides tend to dissociate and affect a wealth of functional , structural and dynamical properties @xcite . due to the nature of the most common solvent in these systems - water - the interfaces between solvent and macromolecules are not only characterised by charges but also by a relatively large differences in respective dielectric properties . in this contribution we will study the effect of these dielectric inhomogeneities on the interactions between charged macromolecular surfaces mediated by the dissolved mobile counterions .",
    "understanding the behaviour of charged systems starts with the proper analysis of the counter - ion distribution around charged object .",
    "the traditional approach to coulomb fluids has been the mean - field poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) formalism applicable at weak surface charges , low counter - ion valency and high temperature @xcite",
    ". the limitations of and corrections to this approach become practically important in highly - charged systems where counterion - mediated interactions between charged bodies start to deviate substantially from the mean - field accepted wisdom @xcite .",
    "one of the most important recent advances in this field has been the systematization of these non - pb effects based on the notions of _ weak _ and _ strong _ coupling approximations as championed by netz and coworkers @xcite .",
    "these two approximations allow for an explicit and exact treatment of charged systems at two disjoint limiting conditions whereas the parameter space in between can only be analysed approximately and is mostly accessible only _ via _ computer simulations .",
    "they also add a transparent and useful systematization to different approaches tending to upgrade or supplement the traditional pb way @xcite .",
    "both the weak and the strong coupling approximations are based on a functional integral or field - theoretic representation @xcite of the grand canonical partition function of a system composed of fixed surface charges with intervening mobile counterions , and depend on the value of a single dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath0 .",
    "if the charge of the counterions with valency @xmath1 is @xmath2 , the bjerrum length @xmath3 is the length which measures the distance at which two unit charges interact with thermal energy @xmath4 ( in water at room temperature , the value is @xmath5 nm ) and the surface charge density of the bounding interfaces is @xmath6 , then the coupling parameter is given by @xmath7 . for later use let us also introduce the standard gouy - chapman length defined as @xmath8 that measures the extent of the counter - ion layer next to a charged surface @xcite .",
    "the meaning of the coupling parameter can now be easily understood by considering the mean distance between counter - ions in the layer next to a charged interface .",
    "the volume available per ion is @xmath9 , so that the mean distance between counterions is of the order of @xmath10 .",
    "since the height of the counter - ion layer is of order of the gouy - chapman length , it follows that in the weak - coupling case , defined by @xmath11 , the height of the layer is much larger than the separation between two neighbouring counter - ions and thus the counterion layer behaves basically as a 3d gas .",
    "each counter - ion in this case interacts with many others and the collective mean - field approach _ ' a la _ poisson - boltzmann is completely justified . on the other hand in the case of the strong coupling limit , defined by @xmath12 ,",
    "the mean distance between counterions @xmath13 is much larger than the layer height , meaning that the counter - ion layer behaves as a 2d gas @xcite . in this case",
    "the mean - field approach breaks down , each counter - ion moving almost independently from the other ones along the direction perpendicular to the wall and the collective effects defining a mean - field being non - existent .",
    "the two limits are thus characterised by a low / high valency of the counterions and/or a small / large value of the surface charge density .",
    "the range of validity of both limits has been explored thoroughly in @xcite .",
    "formally it can be shown that the weak coupling limit can be straightforwardly identified with the saddle - point approximation of the field theoretic representation of the grand canonical partition function @xcite , and is reduced to the pb theory to the lowest order , the next one being due to harmonic fluctuations around the saddle - point that lead to a generalized zero - frequency lifshitz term @xcite .",
    "the strong coupling approximation has no pb - like correlates @xcite since it is formally equivalent to a single particle description , corresponding to two lowest order terms in the virial expansion of the grand canonical partition function .",
    "the consequences and the forms of these two limits of the coulomb fluid description have been explored widely and in detail ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .    in what follows",
    "we propose to add another aspect of the weak - strong coupling dichotomy but this time modified by the presence of dielectric inhomogeneities at the charged boundaries .",
    "these are ubiquitous in soft- and bio - systems since water , being the most common solvent , has a vastly different static dielectric constant ( @xmath14 ) from all matter composing ( bio ) macromolecules ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "every macromolecule - water interface is thus a source of a huge dielectric jump .",
    "as the presence of dielectric discontinuities leads to ( kelvin ) electrostatic image interactions , it is exactly those that we intend to include in the analysis of the counterion mediated interactions between charged macromolecular surfaces . in this work",
    "we will delimit ourselves solely to the planparallel geometry exemplifying the case of interacting planar lipid membranes .",
    "other geometries pertinent to interactions between _ e.g. _ cylindrical dna molecules will follow in a separate publication .    below , we will start _ ' a la _ netz and proceed _ via _ the weak and the strong coupling limits all the while consistently incorporating dielectric discontinuities at all levels of analysis . in the weak coupling limit that we address in order to present a complete and consistent analysis , we will show that for this particular choice of geometry the mean - field term in the interaction pressure is not affected by image interactions ; they only transpire in the second - order fluctuation term around the mean - field .",
    "since this term in the weak coupling limit is by necessity small , so is the image effect .",
    "the opposite is true for the strong coupling limit .",
    "being effectively a single particle description it is quite susceptible to dielectric inhomogeneities and we will show that their effect on the interaction pressure is substantial .",
    "it can even add qualitatively new features to the interaction pressure that are absent when the dielectric discontinuities are ignored .",
    "the analytical results that we derive are particularly _ ' a propos _ in the strong coupling limit since in this case even simulations are hampered down by the long computer times needed to evaluate infinite sums of dielectric images in the energy function .",

    "in this paper we have analysed the effect of dielectric discontinuities on the interaction pressure between two charged surfaces with intervening counterions in planparallel geometry . in this analysis",
    "we have followed the approach of netz and coworkers by explicitly considering the limits of weak and strong coupling .",
    "this limits refer to the value of the electrostatic coupling parameter @xmath0 , which is assumed small in the first limit and large in the second , respectively .",
    "consider first the weak coupling limit with additive contributions from the mean - field and harmonic fluctuations around the mean - field .",
    "we note that the mean - field term in the interaction pressure is not affected by image interactions .",
    "this is easy to understand : in planparallel geometry the mean field depends only on the transverse coordinate , while image interactions by necessity imply also dependencies in the transverse directions . thus by construction the mean field solution in this geometry does not depend on the presence of electrostatic image interactions .",
    "one could add those in by hand , as was done recently by onuki @xcite , but such an approach does not _",
    "sensu stricto _ correspond to a mean - field analysis . on the weak coupling level",
    "the image interactions thus only transpire in the second - order fluctuation term around the mean - field and have the form of a generalized zero - frequency lifshitz term . since this term in the weak coupling limit is by necessity small , so is in general the image effect .",
    "the opposite is true for the strong coupling limit which is effectively a single particle description since it corresponds to the second order virial expansion . as such it is quite susceptible to dielectric inhomogeneities and",
    "their effect on the interaction pressure is substantial .",
    "the image effects boost the value of the interaction pressure in the repulsive - small separations - as well as attractive -larger separations - domain .",
    "for the infinitely polarizable case in fact the pressure can reach infinite values .",
    "also the bound state , defined as the separation at which the interaction pressure is zero , depends drastically and non - monotonically on the value of the dielectric discontinuity . for large differences in the value of the dielectric constant the system shows a tightly bound state .",
    "our computation has an important practical aside .",
    "as we have shown , the first order image correction is not enough to describe accurately the dielectric discontinuity effects on the strong coupling level .",
    "even simulations that take into account only the first order images are not particularly accurate and miss most of the image effect in the interaction pressure .",
    "our calculation is thus particularly valuable in the region of parameter space where other methods obviously fail quite seriously .",
    "the validity of our approach is set by the constraints of the weak - strong coupling formalism as well as its coupling to the image effects .",
    "this is particularly clear in the latter .",
    "the approach followed in this contribution only makes sense if effective lateral separation between counterions is larger than the separation between images in the longitudinal direction .",
    "if this is not the case the strong coupling limit as concieved of above could not be constructed .",
