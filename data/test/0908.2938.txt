    "a clear understanding of nuclear structure beyond the valley of @xmath4-stability requires detailed spectroscopic investigations .",
    "direct reactions , such as single - nucleon transfer reactions are established probes of the single - particle nuclear shell structure and have provided considerable insight into the properties of stable nuclei in the past . with the on - going increase in radioactive nuclear beam intensities , such as those achieved at the spiral facility , this kind of reaction is now feasible .",
    "the inverse kinematics of such reactions leads , however , to significant constraints on the experimental apparatus @xcite .",
    "one of the main obstacles to overcome is to reach good energy resolution in the kinematically reconstructed excitation energy given that the energy spread of the secondary beam may be relatively large , the target - like residue can be emitted over a large angular range and that thick targets are often required to compensate for the relatively low intensities of the beams @xcite .",
    "already , pioneer detectors such as must @xcite and the active target maya @xcite have been build to tackle some of these obstacles and , the detector tiara described here proposes a new alternative to these other apparatus .",
    "the tiara array is designed and built specifically to study direct reactions with radioactive beams and addresses the challenge of the excitation energy resolution by employing the technique of @xmath1-ray tagging .",
    "this has the advantage of providing , in principle , a final excitation energy resolution limited only by doppler broadening .",
    "the tiara array was commissioned at the ganil laboratory through a study of the d(@xmath2n , p)@xmath3n reaction @xcite with coincident @xmath1-ray detection .",
    "the results are reported here together with a full description of the array .",
    "the tiara array @xcite has been designed with the ultimate goal of performing nucleon transfer and other direct reaction studies in inverse kinematics using radioactive ion beams @xcite .",
    "the array is used to identify the binary reaction channels and to determine the excitation energies of the populated states .",
    "this task is achieved by providing position and deposited energy measurements of the light charged target - like residue , which can be emitted over a wide angular range .",
    "tiara consists of a set of single - layer silicon detectors manufactured by micron semiconductor @xcite which covers 85@xmath5 of 4@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tiaracoverage ] ) .",
    "the set includes a large annular double sided silicon strip detector ( sihyball ) , eight resistive charge division silicon detectors forming a `` barrel '' around the target , and two smaller `` cd - type '' silicon strip detectors ( s1 and s2 ) .      eight resistive charge division detectors based on 6-inch silicon wafer technology form an octagonal barrel around the beam axis and surrounding the target .",
    "each of the detectors presents an active area 94.6 mm long and 22.5 mm wide with a thickness of 400 @xmath6 m .",
    "the junction side facing the target is divided into 4 longitudinal resistive strips obtained by p@xmath7 implantation on n - type silicon .",
    "each 4k@xmath8-resistive strip has a 5.65 mm pitch while the inter - strip gap is 100 @xmath6 m .",
    "the strips provide for measurement and pixellation of the azimuthal angle in 32 bins of approximately 9.5@xmath9 .",
    "the pcb board around the silicon has been minimised and bevelled so that the dead area between the detectors as well as between the barrel and annular detectors , is minimised . at one end of the ohmic side of the detector , the pcb board",
    "is extended by @xmath1015 mm in order to gather all the output signal tracks : the 8 position signals ( 2 signals per strip ) and the connection of the ohmic side to ground .",
    "miniature junkosha coaxial cables of 1 mm diameter and 30 cm length were chosen for their favourable vacuum properties to transmit the signals from the detector to the vessel feed - throughs .",
    "once assembled ( fig .",
    "[ fig : photohybbar ] right ) , the barrel presents an octagonal cross section of 27.6 mm side length and 33.3 mm inner radius . from the centre , the angular range spans 36@xmath9 to 144@xmath9 . for the commissioning measurements described later",
    ", the centre of the barrel was mounted 1 mm forward of the target position leading to an angular coverage of 35.5@xmath9 to 143.5@xmath9 .",
    "the measurement of the position along the strip is achieved by resistive charge division and , with alpha particles of 5.5 mev , the position resolution along the longitudinal axis is determined to better than 0.5 mm ( fwhm ) .",
    "the resulting polar angle is thus deduced with a precision better than 1@xmath9 .",
    "the energy of the particle is obtained simply by summing the signals from the two strip ends .",
    "figure  [ fig:3alphas ] was obtained using a mixed source of @xmath11pu , @xmath12am and @xmath13 cm with alpha energies of 5156 , 5484 and 5805 kev respectively .",
    "it illustrates the correlation between the signals from the ends of the strips ( fig  [ fig:3alphas](a ) ) . with a shaping time of 1@xmath6s",
    "the barrel suffers slightly from ballistic deficits which result in a non - linear dependence of the energy sum , measured at each end of a strip , as a function of the position .",
    "nevertheless , this dependence is easily described with a second - order polynomial function and a corresponding corrective factor can be applied to the energy sum .",
    "the resolution for one strip is @xmath1070 kev ( fwhm ) for 5.5 mev alphas ( fig  [ fig:3alphas](b ) ) .",
    "s shaping time .",
    "( c ) : same as ( b ) for the 4 strips of a barrel detector.,width=453,height=264 ]      as noted earlier , in order to enhance the angular coverage of the tiara array , double - sided dc annular silicon - strip detectors are mounted at both ends of the barrel . for these detectors",
    "the annular rings on the entrance face ( junction side ) were fabricated by p@xmath7 implantation on n - type silicon .",
    "the forward angles are covered by two 500 @xmath6 m thick annular detectors based on 4-inch wafer technology .",
    "the smallest of the two ( s2-design ) was positioned 150 mm downstream of the target position covering the polar angular range [ 3.8@xmath9,13.1@xmath9 ] .",
    "the active area is delimited by a disk of 11 mm inner radius and 35 mm outer radius .",
    "the detector is divided into 48 rings of 0.5 mm pitch at the front ( target side ) and 16 azimuthal sectors at the back . however , for the present measurements , the number of channels to instrument was reduced by linking the rings in threes giving effectively 16 rings of 1.5 mm pitch .",
    "the second forward annular detector ( s1 design ) was mounted 92 mm downstream of the target position to cover the polar angular range [ 12.6 @xmath9,27.5@xmath9 ] .",
    "its active area is divided into 4 quadrants of 20.5 mm inner and 48 mm outer radii .",
    "although each quadrant has 16 front rings ( 1.65 mm pitch ) and 4 azimuthal back sectors , for the experiment reported here the four quadrants were combined to form two semi - circles to reduce the total number of rings from 16@xmath154 to 16@xmath152 .",
    "the backward angles from 137.0@xmath9 to 169.4@xmath9 are covered by a 400 @xmath6 m thick double - sided silicon - strip detector ( dsssd ) based on 6-inch wafer technology and positioned 150 mm upstream of the target position .",
    "this detector is composed of six individual wedges ( fig .  [",
    "fig : photohybbar ] ) originally developed at oak ridge for the sihyball forward array @xcite .",
    "each wedge is divided into 16 strips facing the target and 8 azimuthal back sectors .",
    "the active area of a wedge is delimited by inner and outer radii of 28.11 mm and 140 mm , respectively , and spans approximately 55@xmath9 of the total azimuthal angle .",
    "the pitch of the rings is 5.3 mm and the polar angular range is close to 2 degrees per strip .",
    "the energy resolution , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3alphas]b , is typically @xmath1070 kev ( fwhm ) for 5.5 mev alpha particles .",
    "one of the critical features of the tiara array is the target changing mechanism ( fig .",
    "[ fig : target ] ) .",
    "the design of this mechanism has been chosen to maximise the solid angle coverage of the array . positioned upstream , just behind the sihyball",
    ", it offers the possibility to use four different targets during a run without breaking vacuum .",
    "the mechanism consists of a target storage wheel with 4 positions and a rod parallel and slightly offset to the beam axis .",
    "a set of clamps , four on the storage wheel and one at the extremity of the rod ( fig .",
    "[ fig : target ] ) are used to hold the target frames .",
    "the rod is driven along the beam axis via a ball screw .",
    "it first picks up a target from the wheel and continues its motion along the beam axis through the inner hole of the sihyball detector until the target position in the barrel is reached .",
    "the target frame is 3@xmath153 @xmath16 in area with a central hole of 20 mm diameter .",
    "it can only be positioned perpendicular to the beam axis , introducing some shadowing at 90@xmath9 in the barrel detector ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "the whole mechanism is controlled remotely and the position of both the wheel and the rod is monitored by optical readouts .",
    "four feed - throughs on the vacuum vessel are used for the target control system .",
    "the reaction chamber of tiara is made of aluminium and is some 56 cm long ( excluding the target mechanism ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : photosetup ] shows the vessel in position in front of the vamos spectrometer and in the middle of the exogam support structure .",
    "the vessel presents a longitudinal diabolo shape with a central cylindrical section of 85 mm outer diameter housing the barrel and two 500 mm diameter cylindrical sections at each end housing the annular detectors .",
    "two aluminium end plates accommodating fischer dbpe 105-series feed - throughs ( 27 pins each ) and supporting kinematics plates for detector alignment complete the chamber . while one of the end - plates can accommodate up to 17 feed - throughs , the other one , which also includes two pipes for additional pumping , can accommodate up to 15 of them . given that 4 feed - throughs are already used for the target mechanism , a total of 28 feed - throughs can be used for the transmission of the detector signals .",
    "the tiara reaction chamber has been designed to allow a gamma - ray array such as exogam to be placed as close as possible to the target . as such , the thickness of the walls of the central section has been limited to 2 mm in order to reduce the @xmath1-ray attenuation to a minimum . for a photon energy of 1 mev ,",
    "the linear attenuation coefficient in aluminium is 0.166 @xmath17 .",
    "this leads to an attenuation of 3.3@xmath5 in a 0.2 cm layer compare to 8@xmath5 in a 0.5 cm layer .",
    "there are 8@xmath152@xmath154 channels to be instrumented for the octagonal barrel , ( 16 rings + 8 sectors)@xmath156 channels for the sihyball detector , ( 16 rings + 8 sectors)@xmath152 channels for the s1 detector and ( 16 rings + 16 sectors ) channels for the s2 detector , resulting in a total of 288 channels .    a schematic diagram of the tiara electronics is shown in fig .",

    "typically leakage currents of around 0.2 , 0.3 , 4.0 and 1.1 @xmath6a respectively are drawn by each element of the barrel and each wedge of the sihyball , the s1 and the s2 detectors .",
    "the 16 charge - sensitive preamplifiers are mounted in double width nim modules and are designed specifically for use with room temperature silicon - strip detectors and resistive - sheet detectors with capacitances in the range of 0 to 1000pf .",
    "each unit houses two 8 channel motherboards with easily dismountable preamplifier chips .",
    "both the motherboards and preamplifiers chips are housed in a rugged well shielded metal housing . with a quiescent dc output approaching zero ,",
    "this unit is well adapted for use with the caen n568b spectroscopy amplifier , which has 50 @xmath8 input impedance . for each of the six wedges of the sihyball detector ,",
    "one complete module was used for the 16 front rings ( with all 16 hv inputs combined ) while half of another module was used for the eight back sectors . in this way , three preamplifier modules instrumented two wedges of the sihyball .",
    "similarly three and two modules instrumented the s1 and s2 detector , respectively .",
    "for the four resistive strips of each of the eight barrel detectors , only half a module was required with all the corresponding eight preamplifier hv inputs combined and connected .    among the eighteen discriminators , five had to be adapted by the manufacturer to run with positive polarity inputs in order to instrument the eighty back sectors of the sihyball , s1 and s2 dsssd annular detectors .",
    "both the caen amplifiers and discriminators are remotely programmable and , for tiara , the control of this hardware is ensured via the multi instance data acquisition system ( midas)@xcite application developed at the stfc daresbury laboratory . also used for the present work , and programmable via midas , are the eight 32-channel ganil xdc3214 adcs @xcite operating in common dead - time mode and an additional 32-channel silena s9418 adc .",

    "the principal trigger of this commissioning experiment was defined by a hit in any element of tiara .",
    "due to room constraint around the tiara vacuum chamber , a @xmath103 m cable length was necessary to connect the tiara detectors to the preamplifiers . as a direct consequence , the thresholds in energy had to be set high .",
    "they were @xmath101 mev for the double sided annular detectors and @xmath101.5 mev for the resistive charge division detector .",
    "for the commissioning of the array and in order to validate the technique of heavy - ion ",

    "the target was a 1 mg/@xmath18 deuterated polythene ( cd@xmath19)@xmath20 self - supporting foil .",
    "the choice of the reaction was dictated by a number of considerations : ( a ) the ground state of @xmath3n is isolated and easily resolved from the excited states ; ( b ) the excited states populated in the reaction can not be easily resolved in inverse kinematics and ( c ) the reaction has been studied before in direct kinematics with light - particle detection at a similar centre - of - mass energy .    as shown in fig .",

    "the segmented ge clover detectors are all positioned at 90@xmath9 relative to the beam axis and from a distance between the target and the front face of each detector of approximately 5 cm .",
    "the photopeak efficiency in this configuration ( figure  [ fig : tiaexosim ] ) is 13.5@xmath5 at 1.332 mev when the 4 central contact signals of the 4 crystals in each clover detector are added together ( `` addback '' ) .",

    "a plastic finger was placed in front of the vamos focal plane detection system to intercept the intense non - interacting direct beam , which could damage the focal plane detectors .",
    "the data presented here were recorded over a total of approximately 4 hours of beam time with an average beam intensity of 2@xmath2110@xmath22 pps .      knowing the efficiency of the experimental setup is essential if reaction cross sections and , hence , spectroscopic factors , are to be extracted . in this context a complete and realistic simulation of the setup can be extremely useful .",

    "l_=1 for the ground state and _ l_=2 for the two excited states were considered in the dwba calculations in agreement with the results obtained in direct kinematics @xcite .",
    "the experimental proton angular distributions for the ground and excited states were normalized to the theoretical distribution .",
    "the shape of the experimental distributions for the ground state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : datadwba]a ) is in good agreement with the theoretical distributions .",
    "similarly , the shapes of the experimental and theoretical distributions for the two excited states figures  [ fig : datadwba](b ) , and ( c ) , are also in good agreement .    unfortunately , in the present measurements , the absolute cross sections , and hence spectroscopic factors , could not be derived from the data . as noted earlier ,",
    "part of the focal plane of vamos was protected from the transmitted beam by a `` finger '' . as a result",
    ", no direct measurement of the beam dose or of the elastic scattering could be made .",
    "using , however , as a global normalisation the spectroscopic factor of 1.33 for the ground state @xcite , the relative spectroscopic factors for the two excited states may be estimated .",
    "values some 0.7 that of those previously measured @xcite were so deduced , which is within the statistical uncertainties of the measured differential cross section . future measurements with radioactive beams will employ an active `` finger '' together with beam detectors also capable of counting the beam particles .      in the present study , knowing the level scheme of @xmath3n facilitates the identification of the populated states . for a nucleus with unknown level scheme , provided that there is enough statistics , a @xmath1-@xmath1 coincidence analysis can be carried out , in addition of simulations , to restore or establish a consistent level scheme . therefore ,",
    "when coupled to a high efficiency @xmath1-ray detector array , the tiara array proposes a new alternative to other existing detectors for direct reaction with unstable beams .",
    "other detectors like must offer a much higher dynamic range , better particle identification and intrinsic resolution than the tiara array but they have a limited solid - angle coverage which can make ( d , p ) reactions studies difficult . on the other hand , active target detectors like maya competes very much with the tiara array in term of solid - angle coverage and are known to have significant lower energy threshold than silicon detectors .",
    "however , the large volume occupied by active target detectors prohibits a coupling with a @xmath1-ray array and , consequently , the @xmath1-tagging technique can hardly be used .",
    "a new compact , large solid - angle segmented silicon detector array , tiara , designed for the study of direct reactions in inverse kinematics with radioactive beams , has been described .",
    "coupled with a high efficiency @xmath1-ray detector array , such as exogam , tiara employs the technique of light ( target - like ) particle-@xmath1 coincidences to obtain the necessary resolution in excitation energy in the residual target - like recoil .",
    "identification of the latter , if required , may be performed using a magnetic spectrometer such as vamos .",
    "these techniques have been validated in a commissioning experiment in which the d(@xmath2n , p@xmath1)@xmath3n reaction was measured . in the near future , it is planned to increase the dynamic range of the silicon detector by the installation of a second 700 @xmath6 m thick si layer around the existing barrel detectors together with 15 mm thick csi(tl ) segmented detectors backing the forward angle annular detectors .",
    "the collaboration wishes to thank the ganil cyclotron operations crew for delivering the @xmath2n beam .",
