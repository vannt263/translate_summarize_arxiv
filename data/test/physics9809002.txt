    "in recent years , there has been increased interest in spectral features that can attributed directly to the recoil atoms undergo on the absorption , emission or scattering of radiation . among topics that have been discussed that fall into this category",
    "are recoil - induced resonances ( rir ) @xcite and the collective atomic recoil laser ( carl ) @xcite .",
    "these processes appear to have much in common , although they are described quite differently .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to compare the rir and carl and to demonstrate that the rir and carl _ formalisms _ are equivalent .",
    "the reason that this equivalence is not readily apparent is two - fold .",
    "firstly , the rir have been discussed using a density matrix approach in the schrdinger picture , whereas carl has been discussed using an operator approach in the heisenberg picture .",
    "secondly , rir and carl have generally been examined for different ranges of the various parameters characterizing the atom - field interactions . in order to facilitate the discussion , it is useful to review briefly the rir and carl .    since both the rir and carl relate to probe field absorption or gain in the presence of a pump field , it is perhaps best to recall the features of the probe absorption spectrum , _ neglecting all effects associated with recoil_. consider an ensemble of two - level atoms interacting with both a pump and probe field .",
    "the probe absorption or gain is monitored as a function the probe - pump detuning @xmath5 for various pump field strengths , characterized by the pump field rabi frequency @xmath6 .",
    "it is assumed that all collisional effects can be neglected and that the two - level atomic system is _ closed _ in the sense that the sum of ground and excited state populations is conserved for _ each _ velocity subclass of atoms .",
    "moreover , it is assumed that the pump field detuning @xmath7 from atomic resonance is much larger than any decay rates , rabi frequencies , or doppler shifts in the problem . in this limit ,",
    "the probe absorption spectrum consists of three features , centered near @xmath8 @xcite .    of primary concern here",
    "is the structure centered near @xmath9 in the absence of recoil , this line feature has a dispersion - like shape , is proportional to @xmath10 , and has a width of order of the excited state decay rate @xcite . its origin can be traced to an interference effect involving processes in which _ two _ photons are emitted into previously unoccupied vacuum mode states @xcite .",
    "as such , it is linked to spontaneous emission , rather than a conservative exchange of energy between the pump and probe fields .",
    "the fact that the two - level system is  closed  plays a critical role here .",
    "had the system been  open , ",
    "the amplitude of this component would vary as @xmath11 rather than @xmath12 and its width could be determined by some effective ground state decay rate ( e.g. inverse transit time ) rather than the excited state decay rate @xcite .",
    "the rir refer to a class of spectroscopic features in nonlinear spectroscopy that can be attributed to a recoil - induced  opening  of an otherwise closed , two - level system @xcite . in the presence of recoil ,",
    "the atomic velocity is changed on the absorption or emission of radiation . as a consequence",
    "the sum of ground and excited state populations for specific velocity classes is no longer conserved . in the limit of large detuning @xmath13",
    ", the rir can be interpreted as arising from raman transitions between different center - of - mass states @xcite . if the pump and probe fields have propagation vectors * k*@xmath14 and * k*@xmath15 , respectively , then probe absorption occurs on a raman transition between center - of - mass momentum states @xmath16 and @xmath17 and gain between states @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20*k*@xmath21*k*@xmath15 .",
    "depending on the detuning @xmath5 between the probe and pump fields , one of these processes is favored . for @xmath22 ,",
    "there is probe gain , for @xmath23 there is probe absorption , and for @xmath24 the nonlinear probe absorption and gain vanish . in general , the rir have been formulated as a _ stationary _ process in which the field achieves a steady - state value at each position @xmath25 - gain occurs as the probe field propagates through the active medium .",
    "steady state is achieved by assuming that there is some effective ground state decay rate or , alternatively , by assuming that the doppler width associated with the raman transitions , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an atomic mass and @xmath3 is the width of the momentum distribution , is larger than the recoil frequency , @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the gain is normally expressed as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the probe field s amplitude and @xmath31 is a constant proportional to the atomic density .",
    "the point to note here is that the derivative of @xmath30 depends _ locally _ on @xmath32    in contrast to the rir , carl has been formulated as a _ transient _ problem .",
    "it is assumed that the pump and probe fields are modes of an optical cavity in which the atoms are located . as a result of the atom - field interaction , the probe field builds up in the cavity as a function of time . in the limit of large @xmath33",
    "one obtains an equation of the form @xmath34 , where @xmath35 where is a constant proportional to the atomic density and @xmath36 is a kernel . if @xmath37 , the time derivative of @xmath30 can depend on the past history of the field , rather than locally on the field",
    "this leads to very different dynamics than those encountered in the rir .",
    "one finds threshold conditions for probe gain that depend nonlinearly on the atomic density , as does the gain itself .",
    "carl is a cooperative effect in the sense that gain occurs only for some minimum atomic density for most values of the detuning @xmath5 .",
    "it is possible to have gain for @xmath38 which is not possible for the rir . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath39 , the equation for @xmath40 becomes local and the gain characteristics of carl become identical to those of the rir .",
    "thus , although both the rir and carl can be formulated for arbitrary ratios of @xmath41 , one can label the rir limit as one in which @xmath42 and the carl limit as one in which @xmath43 @xcite@xmath44 this is the nomenclature that is adopted in this article .",
    "the carl limit can be stated as , @xmath45 , which places it at or near the _ subrecoil limit _ of atom cooling .",
    "it should be noted that verkerk and bonifacio @xcite and bonifacio _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that the carl equations reproduce the rir results in the limit that @xmath46 ; however the approach they followed differs considerably from the one to be presented herein .",
    "it is important to recognize that it is possible for @xmath40 to depend locally @xmath47 , even in the  carl limit , ",
    "@xmath48 . for example , if one includes ground state decay with rate @xmath49 , a local dependence occurs if @xmath50 as a consequence , in the presence of decay , the rir limit can be stated as one in which @xmath42 _ or _ @xmath51 and the carl limit as one in which @xmath52 _ and _",
    "moreover , the build up of the probe field at very early times always varies linearly with the atomic density and can be viewed as a local process . in this sense ,",
    "the theory of rir is always valid at early times - the specific conditions are given in sec .",
    "however , when @xmath52 and @xmath54 , the gain coefficient in carl depends nonlinearly on the atomic density for times @xmath55 @xcite , and the local dependence no longer holds .    in sec .",
    "ii , the basic equations are derived and the rir and carl limits of these equations are obtained in sec .",
    "iii . an effective potential for ground state atoms",
    "is written which helps to categorize the rir and carl limits .",
    "the case of equal pump and probe frequencies is analyzed in sec .",
    "iv using an effective five - level atom .",
    "when expressed in this form the calculation has a range of applicability beyond the recoil problem .",
    "the results are discussed in sec .",
    "v. special emphasis is placed on the distinction between  atom bunching  and  matter gratings .",
    " experimental implications of the results are also explored .",
    "the problem under consideration consists of a pump field and a probe field interacting with an ensemble of two level atoms . in some applications in carl , it may be of interest to use a quantized description of the fields to follow the build - up of the probe field from noise , but , in the present discussion , the fields are taken to be classical .",

    ", the probe field can be amplified . if the pump field is initially much more intense than the probe field ,",
    "as is assumed , pump depletion during the early stages of probe amplification can be neglected . since the calculation in this paper",
    "is limited to the early stages of probe amplification , i take the pump field amplitude to be constant , @xmath65    the dynamics of probe field amplification depends on the specific atom - field geometry .",
    "one can envision situations in which the probe field amplitude is constant in time but varies in space , or is constant in space but varies in time .",
    "the first case is the one considered generally in the rir , in which _ cw _ pump and probe fields interact with atoms in a cell or trap .",
    "the probe field amplitude increases in the direction of @xmath63 as it propagates through the medium , but is assumed to have evolved to a stationary state .",
    "the second case is the one considered generally in carl , in which the fields correspond to field modes of an optical cavity and the atoms are located in the cavity . for a ring cavity ,",
    "the probe field intensity is spatially isotropic , but increases in time @xcite . in certain limits ( to be noted below ) , the spatial gain coefficient of the rir multiplied by the speed of light coincides with the temporal gain coefficient of carl . in other limits ,",
    "the dynamics of carl amplification differs from the spatial build - up of the field in the rir . to compare the rir and carl , it is convenient to adopt the cavity model and assume that the probe field amplitude is a function of time only ,",
    "@xmath66 all cavity losses are neglected , as is any ground state decay .",
    "although carl is referred to as a collective effect since conditions for carl gain depend on the atomic density , each atom in the sample , on average , interacts with the fields in an identical manner .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to write the hamiltonian for a single atom interacting with the fields .",
    "the dependence of the field gain on atomic density is included automatically in the coupled maxwell - bloch equations . in the dipole and rotating wave approximations , the hamiltonian for our system is @xmath67 ,   \\label{3}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the atomic center - of - mass momentum , @xmath69 is the transition frequency between the ground state @xmath70 and excited state @xmath71 of the atom , @xmath72 @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the rabi frequency of field @xmath75 , and * @xmath76*@xmath77*@xmath76*@xmath70 is a dipole moment matrix element .",
    "terms related to spontaneous emission are not included in the hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) , for reasons to be discussed below .",
    "the hamiltonian determines the time evolution of the atom , but the atomic evolution must be coupled to the field evolution via maxwell s equations to arrive at a closed set of equations .",
    "the time evolution of the ( complex ) probe field amplitude is linked to the polarization of the medium which , in turn , is determined by the atom - field interaction .",

    "if inequalities ( [ 19 ] ) hold , both the rir and carl can be interpreted in terms of _ stimulated _ processes involving the pump and probe fields - spontaneous emission plays a negligible role .",

    "the term  atomic bunching  refers to a redistribution or focusing of atoms in an optical potential . for the rir and carl , _",
    "these terms are synonymous_. if recoil effects are neglected , that is , if the center - of - mass motion is treated classically from the outset , the _ total atomic density _ is conserved for each velocity subclass of atoms ( neglecting collisions ) .",
    "a homogeneous atomic density remains homogeneous to all orders in the atom - field interaction .",
    "recoil effects allow for a modification of the total atomic density . whether one calls this  atomic bunching  or ",
    "matter grating ",
    "production is a matter of personal preference @xcite .",
    "the key point is that the modification of the total atomic density results entirely from effects related to recoil on the absorption , emission , or scattering of radiation .",
    "to lowest order in the atom - field interaction , the matter grating or atomic bunching consists of a spatial modulation of the atomic density having period 2@xmath314 . with increasing field strength , higher order spatial harmonics",
    "are produced , corresponding to  higher order matter gratings  or  focusing  or  atomic bunching .",
    " of course it is possible to derive an effective potential of the form @xmath315 \\right\\ } \\left| 1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|   \\label{68}\\ ] ] _ without _ quantization of the center - of - mass motion and to consider _ classical _ motion in this potential .",
    "however , since the effective potential is proportional to @xmath316 , any changes in the atomic density vanish in the classical limit .",
    "this is in contrast to bunching in the free electron laser where the effective potential does not vanish in the classical limit .    are there situations where matter gratings are produced by fields without any contribution from recoil ?",
    "the answer to this question is  yes , ",
    "provided one considers the matter gratings associated with individual internal atomic states rather than the total atomic density .",
    "for example , for an ensemble of _ stationary _ , closed , two - level atoms there is a spatial modulation in the _ population difference_@xmath317between the excited and ground states produced by the pump and probe fields .",
    "scattering of the pump field from this spatially modulated population difference leads to a dispersion - shaped probe absorption profile centered at a probe - pump detuning @xmath210 in the limit of large atom - field detuning @xmath318 the amplitude of the dispersion profile varies as the square of the pump field intensity and its width is equal to the excited state decay rate @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to have gain profiles with a width corresponding to some effective ground state decay time if one considers open systems in which spontaneous emission also plays a role .",
    "for example , if the ground state consists of two hyperfine states and the fields drive transitions between only one of these ground states and an excited state , then , as a result of spontaneous emission , both ground state sublevel populations can be spatially modulated ( although the _ total _ atomic density - the sum of all ground and excited state populations - remains constant in the absence of recoil ) . it is possible to monitor the atomic gratings in specific ground state hyperfine levels by using radiation that couples only the targeted ground state sublevel to an excited state .",
    "finally , i would like to discuss some experimental implications of the rir and carl . to observe the spectral features of the rir and carl , it is best to use cold atoms in a collisionless environment .",
    "moreover , to isolate the effects of interest , one must use experiments which involve closed , two - level transitions or signals that depend only on total atomic state density .",
    "the rir have already been observed in several experiments involving laser - cooled atoms @xcite .",
    "the experiments in which evidence for carl was claimed @xcite were all carried out under conditions ( collisions , radiation trapping , large doppler widths ) which do not favor observation of carl .",
    "the results of these experiments can be explained by conventional theories in which recoil is neglected @xcite . as was mentioned previously ,",
    "the carl limit is essentially a subrecoil limit . although the carl limit has been stated as @xmath319 , when @xmath320 a better estimate for the carl regime is @xmath321 @xcite . for densities of order 10@xmath322atoms / m@xmath323 ,",
    "it is possible to achieve values of @xmath324 of order 100 - 1000 .",
    "thus , it may be possible to observe carl for atoms cooled to or somewhat above the sub - doppler limit of laser cooling .",
    "the linear gain coefficient in this case is of order @xmath325s@xmath326 , which must exceed any cavity loss .",
