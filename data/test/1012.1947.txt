    "cellular network is a kind of radio network consisting of a number of fixed access points known as base stations and a large number of users ( or mobiles ) .",
    "each base station covers a geometrical region known as a cell and serve all users in this cell .",
    "interference and noise are two factors annoying communications in cellular wireless networks .",
    "noise is unavoidable and comes from natural sources .",
    "interferences come from users and base stations .",
    "the use of recent technologies such as sdma ( spatial division multiple access ) and mimo ( multiple input multiple output ) can reduce significantly interferences so that we can hope that in a near future the impact of interferences will be negligible and noise will become the only factor harming the network .",
    "the best case is when interferences from other cells are perfectly canceled , the network is then said to be in noise limited regime . in this paper , we consider and introduce a framework to study this kind of network .    in existing literature , base stations ( bs ) locations",
    "are usually modeled as an ideal regular hexagonal lattice . in reality ,",
    "base stations are irregularly located , especially in an urban area , and the cell radius is not the same for each bs . in this paper , we model the base station locations as an homogenous poisson point process @xmath0 of intensity @xmath1 .",
    "such a model comes from stochastic geometry .",
    "it is sufficently versatile by changing @xmath1 to cover a wide number of real situations and it is mathematically tractable . for an introduction to the usage of stochastic geometry for wireless networks performances",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "theory and number of pertinent examples can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for all theoretical details , we refer the first opus .    to model cellular network cells , voronoi tessellations are frequently used .",
    "it is based on the assumption that each user is served by the closest bs .",
    "unfortunately , this is not always very accurate since in real life , a mobile connects to the _ best _ bs it can have , i.e. , the bs which offers it the best signal over noise ratio .",
    "best _ bs is not always the closest because of the fading environment . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the impact of fading by considering that users are served by the base station providing the best signal power .",
    "the location of users in the plane are modeled as another homogenous poisson point process @xmath2 of intensity @xmath3 .",
    "while ancient cellular networks such as gsm and gprs provided only voice service and low data transmission rate , recent and emergent wireless cellular networks such as wimax or lte offer higher data rate and other services requiring high throughput such as video calls .",
    "each service requires a different level of signal to noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "if the snr does not reach a required threshold due to the radio condition , the service can not be established or may be interrupted .",
    "such calls are said to be in outage .",
    "the outage probability is one of key measurement of the network performance .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to determine the outage probability of noise limited network , or equivalently the distribution of snr , which turns out to be equivalent to determine the distribution of the smallest path loss fading .",
    "in fact , there have been some works dealing with the outage probability of noise limited wireless network , but almost all of them consider the exponent path loss model .",
    "this paper provides a general formula for outage probability taking into account a more general model of path loss .",
    "once the distribution of snr of a user is determined , the distribution of functionals related to snr can be easily derived . in some situations",
    ", we have to study the distribution of the sum of a functional for all users in a cell .",
    "for example , in an ofdma noise limited cellular system , the number of sub channels required for a user demanding a particular service depends on its snr .",
    "if the total number of sub channels of all users in a cell excesses the number of available sub channels in this cell then at least one user is blocked .",
    "the probability of that to happen , sometimes called infeasibility probability , contains extremely important information on the performance of the network .",
    "since it is often impossible to find the explicit probability distribution of additive functionals , we calculate the expectation , and bounds on the variance of such random variables .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : model scenario",
    "] , we describe the model . in section [ section : poisson point process of pathloss fading ] , we show that the path loss fading can be viewed as a poisson point process on the real line and we provide a general formula for the outage probability . in section [ section : capacity user ] ,",
    "we calculate average capacity of a user and of a cell .",
    "we also compute upper and lower bounds for their variance as closed form expressions seem untractable .",
    "section [ section : examples ] illustrates the results obtained for some particular situations .",
    "consider a bs ( base station ) located at @xmath4 with transmission power @xmath5 and a mobile located at @xmath6 .",
    "the mobile s received signal has average power @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the path loss function .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 is measurable function on @xmath9 .",
    "the most used path loss function is the so - called path loss exponent model @xmath10 where @xmath11 refers to the euclidean norm of @xmath12 .",
    "this function gives raise to nice closed formulas but is rather unrealistic : close to the bs , the signal is infinitely amplified .",
    "a more realistic model is the modified path loss model given by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a reference distance and @xmath15 a constant depending on the environment .",
    "in addition to this deterministic large scale effect , we consider the fading effect , which is by essence random . the received signal power from a bs located at @xmath4 to a mobile unit ( mu for short ) located at @xmath6 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 are independent copies of a random variable @xmath18 .",
    "most used fading random models are log - normal shadowing and rayleigh fading .",
    "the log - normal shadowing is such that @xmath18 is a log - normal random variable and we can write @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the rayleigh fading is such that @xmath18 is an exponential random variable of parameter @xmath21 .",
    "we can also consider the rayleigh - lognormal composite fading , in this case the fading is the product of the log - normal shadowing factor and the rayleigh fading factor .",
    "it is worth noting that the log - normal shadowing usually improves the network performance while rayleigh fading usually degrades performances .",
    "we assume that once in the network , a mobile is attached to the bs that provides it the best signal strength .",
    "if the power received at this point is greater than some threshold @xmath22 , we say that @xmath6 is covered .",
    "if @xmath6 is not covered by any bs then a mu at @xmath6 can not establish a communication and thus is said to be in outage . in the case of path loss exponent model with no fading ( @xmath23 ) , the best bs for given mobile is always its nearest bs .",
    "we assume that the point process of bss @xmath24 is an homogenous poisson point process of intensity @xmath1 on @xmath25 and that users are distributed in the plane as a poisson point process @xmath26 of intensity @xmath3 .    to avoid any technical difficulty , from now on",
    ", we make the following assumptions :    [ assumption ] assume that :    1 .",

    "define @xmath32 .",
    "then , we have @xmath33 for all @xmath34 .",
    "in this section , similarly to  @xcite , we show that the path loss fading process is a poisson point process on the positive half of the real line .    for each location @xmath6 on @xmath25 , consider the path loss fading process @xmath35 where @xmath36 .    [",

    "the cdf and pdf of @xmath53 are easily derived according to the property of poisson point processes :    [ proposition cdf pdf of a_ms ] the complementary cumulative distribution function of @xmath54 is given by : @xmath55 and its probability density function is given by @xmath56    the event @xmath57 is equivalent to the event ( in the interval @xmath58,$ ] there are at most @xmath59 points ) and the number of points in this interval follows a poisson distribution of mean @xmath60 .",
    "thus , we have : @xmath61 the pdf is thus given by @xmath62 the proof is thus complete .    [ lemma : b(t ) of path loss exponent ] if @xmath63 then : @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "the path loss function depends only on the distance from the bs to the user . by the change of variable @xmath66 and by integration by substitution",
    ", we have : @xmath67 hence the result .",
    "remark that this result can also be derived from @xcite .",
    "we observe that the distribution of the point process @xmath37 does depend only on @xmath68 but not on the distribution of fading @xmath18 itself .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained as in @xcite(page 159 ) . if the fading is log - normal shadowing , i.e @xmath19 where @xmath69 then @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "if the fading is rayleigh fading , i.e @xmath72 then @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the upper incomplete gamma function .",
    "similarly to the distance to @xmath59-th nearest bs ( which can be found in @xcite ) , the distribution of @xmath59-th less strong path loss fading @xmath54 can be characterized as follows :    if @xmath63 , @xmath54 is distributed according to the generalized gamma distribution : @xmath75    this is a consequence of proposition [ proposition cdf pdf of a_ms ] and lemma [ lemma : b(t ) of path loss exponent ] .",
    "we can also investigate more general and realistic path loss model .    if @xmath76 then : @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "in addition , we have : @xmath79 if the fading is lognormal shadowing @xmath19 where @xmath80 then we have : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the _ q_-function and @xmath83 .",
    "if the fading is rayleigh @xmath72 then @xmath84    similarly to the path loss exponent model case ,",
    "we have : @xmath85 we then obtain equation ( [ equ : corr : modif exponent ] ) .",
    "now differentiate the two sides of that equation to get : @xmath86 that yields equation ( [ equ : corr : modif exponent path bphay ] ) . in the case of lognormal",
    "shadowing we have : @xmath87 in the case of rayleigh fading we have : @xmath88 by a change of variables .",
    "hence the results .",
    "the number of bs covering a point @xmath6 is distributed according to the poisson distribution of parameter @xmath89 . in particular , the outage probability given a threshold @xmath22 is @xmath90    the path loss fading @xmath37 is a poisson point process on @xmath91 with intensity @xmath92 , so the number of point on the interval @xmath93 is distributed according to poisson distribution of parameter @xmath89 .    , for rayleigh fading @xmath94 ; @xmath95 , @xmath96.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    figure [ outagefigure ] represents the outage probability for different models of fading .",
    "this shows that the curves of modified path loss exponent model is generally higher than those of path loss exponent model but they are very close in the low outage region .",
    "in this section , we calculate the mean of any capacity function of a user .",
    "remark that since the system is spatially stationary the statistic of the path loss fading and the capacity of a user does not depend on his position .",
    "since the pdf and the cdf of the path loss fading @xmath97 have been already calculated in proposition [ proposition cdf pdf of a_ms ] , the mean of a capacity function of a user follows immediately .",
    "in particular :    the average capacity per user is @xmath98 in the case of path loss exponent model @xmath63 , we have : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the laplace transform of the capacity function @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "equation ( [ equation : theorem capacity per user ] ) comes from proposition [ proposition cdf pdf of a_ms ] .",
    "if the path loss exponent model is considered , then we have : @xmath103 by the change of variable @xmath104 .",
    "the statistic of the cell capacity @xmath105 is more difficult to analyze . in this section ,",
    "we calculate its mean @xmath106 and lower bound and upper bound of its variance @xmath107 .",
    "we state the following lemma , which is straightforward due to assumption [ assumption ] but still useful :    [ lemma : bex bey indepent ] given a fixed configuration @xmath0 of bss , the poisson point processes of path loss fading @xmath37 and @xmath108 are independent for any two different points @xmath109 .",

    "thus , the marked point process @xmath119 is a poisson point process .",
    "using the campbell theorem we have : @xmath120 as a consequence , @xmath121 in virtue of lemma [ lemma : pdf of p_yx ] , proposition [ proposition : poisson point process of path shadow ] and collary [ proposition cdf pdf of a_ms ] , we have : @xmath122 for the case of path loss exponent model , equation [ equation : theorem sum capa exp pathloss ] follows easily .",
    "this completes the proof .",
