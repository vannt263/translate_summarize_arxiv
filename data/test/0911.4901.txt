    "since the discovery of the hot solar corona by edln ( 1943 ) , different theories of coronal heating have been put forward and debated .",
    "heyvaerts & priest ( 1983 ) , hereafter hp83 , were first to suggest that the phase - mixing of alfvn waves in coronal plasmas could be a primary mechanism in coronal heating .",
    "they showed that the phase - mixing occurs due to inhomogeneity of the local alfvn phase speed across the background magnetic field .",
    "hp83 analytically showed that in both the strong phase - mixing limit and the weak damping approximation , the amplitude of standing alfvn waves decays with time as @xmath0 where @xmath4 is a function of the coordinate corresponding to the inhomogeneous direction ( @xmath5 , in this paper ) .",
    "since then , much analytical and numerical work has been done on the subject .",
    "nocera et al .",
    "( 1984 ) studied the phase mixing of propagating alfvn waves in an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "they pointed out if transverse gradients are smeared out as soon as they are formed , this yields to weak phase mixing where damping laws differ from solutions of hp83 . parker ( 1991 ) investigated the effect of a density and/or temperature gradient in the direction of vibration of a transverse alfvn wave .",
    "the result was a strong coupling of the waves on different lines of force , producing a coordinated mode that was not subject to simple phase mixing .",
    "hood et al.(1997a ) derived a self similar solution of the alfvn wave phase - mixing equations for heating of coronal holes .",
    "they showed that the damping of the waves with height follows the scaling predicted by hp83 at low heights , before switching to an algebraic decay at large heights .",
    "hood et al .",
    "( 1997b ) obtained a simple , self similar solution for the heating of coronal loops by phase mixing .",
    "they showed the hp83 model still does work well in a certain class of coronal loops and the phase mixing can supply heating at large lundquist number at timescales shorter than or comparable with the radiative cooling timescale .",
    "nakariakov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) considered the nonlinear excitation of fast magnetosonic waves by phase mixing alfvn waves in a cold plasma with a smooth inhomogeneity of density across a uniform magnetic field .",
    "they suggested this nonlinear process as a possible mechanism of indirect plasma heating by phase mixing through the excitation of fast waves .",
    "but botha et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that the nonlinear generation of fast modes by alfvn waves has little effect on classical phase mixing .",
    "de moortel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) elaborated the effect of density stratification on phase - mixing .",
    "they remarked that when the inhomogeneity in the horizontal direction in the plasma is sufficiently large , so the phase mixing is strong , stratification is unimportant . in the other words due to the rapid phase mixing , energy can be dissipated before the effects of stratification build up .",
    "de moortel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) studied the combined effect of a gravitationally stratified density and a radially diverging background magnetic field on phase mixing of alfvn waves .",
    "they found that : i ) the efficiency of phase mixing depends strongly on the particular geometry of the configuration .",
    "ii ) depending on the value of the scale height the wave amplitudes can damp either slower or faster than in the uniform non - diverging model .",
    "hood et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that the amplitude of single pulse and bipolar pulse traveling in the z direction , contrary to infinite wavetrain , have slower algebraic damping of the form @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , rather than exponential in time .",
    "tsiklauri et al .",
    "( 2003 ) cleared that the decay rate of the alfvnic part of a compressible 3d mhd pulse is affected linearly by the degree of localization of the pulse in the homogeneous transverse direction , but the dynamic of alfvn waves can still be obtained from the previous 2.5d models , e.g. , hood et al .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that in presence of the both density stratification and magnetic field divergence , the enhanced phase mixing mechanism can dissipate alfvn waves at heights less than half that was predicted by the previous analytical solutions .",
    "they stated that if phase - mixing takes place in strongly divergent magnetic fields , it is not necessary to invoke anomalous viscosity in corona .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the phase mixing of a packet of standing shear alfvn waves in presence of the both viscous and resistive dissipations .",
    "to do this , we numerically solve the linearized mhd equations and obtain the damping time of the oscillations . our aim is to test the validity of hp83 s damping law for different ranges of the reynolds and lundquist numbers .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we introduce the basic equations of motion and introduce the model . in sect .",
    "3 , the numerical results are reported , while the conclusions are given in sect .",
    "the linearized mhd equations for a zero-@xmath8 plasma are : @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the eulerian perturbations in the velocity and magnetic fields ; @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the mass density , the electrical conductivity , the viscosity and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "the simplifying assumptions are :    * under coronal conditions gas pressure is negligible ( zero-@xmath8 ) ; * the equilibrium density profile is @xmath17 ; * there is a constant magnetic field along the @xmath18 axis , @xmath19 ; * there is no initial steady flow inside or outside of the tube ; * the viscous and resistive coefficients , @xmath15 and @xmath14 respectively , are constants .    to solve eqs .",
    "( [ mhd1])-([mhd2 ] ) , following hp83 , we neglect the variations in @xmath20 direction , @xmath21 , and will further assume that the velocity perturbs in @xmath20 direction .",
    "so we choose a solution for the velocity perturbation as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the length of the loop and @xmath24 is the wave number in @xmath18 direction , respectively . here",
    "the waves are standing because of boundary conditions @xmath25 .",
    "note that hp83 also supposed that the loop is bounded from above an below by boundaries at altitude @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "we choose the boundary and initial conditions as @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71    there is an upper limit for the time of simulation because we can simulate the evolution until any excitement near the @xmath5 boundaries could be occurred .",

    "@xmath74 clears that the defocusing of the packet in the case ( a ) is large but not in the case ( b ) .",
