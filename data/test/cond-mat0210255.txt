    "almost a century ago , schottky pointed out that if electrons are emitted as discrete particles independently of each other , current fluctuations are to be expected with the noise power : @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the elementary charge and @xmath2 the mean current .",
    "@xcite this phenomenon , called the `` shot effect '' by schottky , was later observed in vacuum tubes @xcite in nice agreement with his prediction .    during the last two decades ,",
    "the shot effect ( now called shot noise ) has been discovered and intensively studied in mesoscopic phase - coherent conductors .",
    "@xcite in a quantum point contact ( qpc ) , for instance , the current - noise power was found to be @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the transmission probability ( for one - channel transmission ) . in this formula , the noise is suppressed by the factor @xmath5 relative to the schottky result , thereby predicting zero noise for perfect transmission ( see experimental evidence @xcite ) . in both cases , in qpcs and vacuum tubes , the granularity of charge is manifested in the shot noise , although the source of randomness is different : @xcite in qpc , the randomness appears in the transmission process due to the quantum partitioning between the incoming and outgoing states ( the incoming carriers are noiseless ) .",
    "in contrast , in vacuum tubes , the randomness is an inherent property of the emitter caused by thermal fluctuations .",
    "an interesting question then arises : is it possible to observe the quantum partition noise in electron emission , in the same way as in qpcs , with the noise power suppressed below the @xmath6 value ?",
    "the related question  whether the shot noise in schottky s vacuum tube is classical  has been addressed recently by schnenberger , oberholzer , sukhorukov , and grabert .",
    "@xcite the authors showed that for the vacuum tube parameters typical for the earlier stages of development of vacuum electronics , @xcite the quantum partitioning in electron emission is absent , and consequently the shot noise observed in schottky s vacuum tubes is classical .    in this paper",
    "we show that in new generation electron emitters , scaled down to the nanometer dimensions , shot noise much smaller than the schottky noise , due to a quantum partitioning effect , is observable .",
    "moreover , two different sources of randomness  thermal agitations and quantum partitioning  may act together governing the electron emission noise .",
    "@xcite a rapidly growing field of nanoscale electronics suggests to us various examples of electron emitters in which this phenomenon may be tested : the nanotube field emitters , @xcite the composite emitters coated by wide - band - gap , low - work - function , and/or negative - electron - affinity materials , @xcite diamondlike emitters , @xcite among others .",
    "we start by considering the electron emission as a quantum scattering problem within the landauer - bttiker framework . the transverse and longitudinal motion of electrons",
    "are assumed to be separable , so that one can specify the quantum channels associated with transverse modes , and define the scattering states .",
    "the equation for the mean current in a phase - coherent conductor attached to two electron reservoirs with different chemical potentials reads @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the energy distribution functions at the left ( @xmath9 ) and right ( @xmath10 ) reservoirs , @xmath11 is the matrix of the transmission amplitudes , @xcite and the trace is taken over all the transmission channels at energy @xmath12 .",
    "for definiteness , the left reservoir is considered as an emitter , and the right reservoir , to which an external positive bias is applied , as a collector .",
    "we assume that the `` quantum conductor '' between the two reservoirs could also be a vacuum gap . at the surface of the emitter  between the emitter - vacuum or emitter - semiconductor interface",
    " a potential barrier exists , which limits the current and scatters the emitted electrons ( only elastic scattering is assumed ) .",
    "thus the transmission matrix @xmath11 is referred to the scattering on the potential barrier .",
    "the zero - frequency current - noise power for a two - terminal quantum conductor is given by @xcite @xmath13 \\ , { \\rm",
    "tr}({\\bf t}^{\\dag}{\\bf t}{\\bf t}^{\\dag}{\\bf t } ) \\\\ + [ f_l ( 1 - f_r ) + f_r ( 1 - f_l ) ] \\ , [ { \\rm tr}({\\bf t}^{\\dag}{\\bf t } ) -   { \\rm tr}({\\bf t}^{\\dag}{\\bf t}{\\bf t}^{\\dag}{\\bf t } ) ] \\},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 the unit of conductance . for sufficiently high biases , all the states in the collector at energies corresponding to the occupied states at the emitter ( that contribute to the emission )",
    ". hence one can take @xmath15 . in this case",
    ", the steady - state emission current in the basis of eigen - channels becomes @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the transmission probabilities associated with @xmath18 quantum channels at energy @xmath12 .",
    "hereafter , we drop the subindex @xmath9 at the occupation numbers @xmath19 , since only the emitter contact contributes to the current and noise .",
    "the noise power ( [ stwo2 ] ) for the unidirectional injection becomes @xmath20 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv s_i^{\\rm em } + s_i^{\\rm part}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this formula describes the spectral density of current fluctuations of an electron emitter .",
    "it unifies two sources of randomness : ( i ) the probabilistic occupation of states in the emitter ( through the function @xmath19 ) and ( ii ) the probabilistic reflection and transmission at the interface barrier ( through the probabilities @xmath21 ) .",
    "the first source of randomness is intimately related to intrinsic thermal agitations of the emitter and can be associated with the first term in eq .",
    "( [ sone ] ) .",
    "since @xmath22 , this term is related to a thermal broadening of the occupation numbers at the fermi level .",
    "note that it vanishes at zero temperature , but dominates in the absence of partitioning when all transmission coefficients @xmath21 are either @xmath23 or @xmath24 , and hence can be interpreted as the _ emission shot noise_. the second source of randomness associated with the last term in eq .",
    "( [ sone ] ) is caused by quantum partitioning and the fact that charge is carried by discrete portions ( shot effect ) .",
    "it only contributes for transmission probabilities @xmath25 , it does not vanish at zero temperature , and can be called the _ partition shot noise_. it is clear that both noise sources act together and can not be separated , in general . @xcite for future analysis , it is convenient , however , to introduce the notations for the emission noise @xmath26 and the partition noise @xmath27 according to the above discussion .",
    "equation ( [ sone ] ) can be used to calculate the noise power of the emitter with an arbitrary number of quantum channels .",
    "the problem can be simplified by assuming that the interface of the emitter is plane and its transversal area is large compared with wavelength ( a large number of channels ) .",
    "then , the summation over the transverse channels can be replaced by integration over the transversal energy @xmath28 , which can be performed giving @xmath29\\ , \\ln[1+e^{(e_f - e)/k_bt}]\\ , de \\right\\},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the sharvin conductance , @xmath31 is the fermi energy , @xmath32 is the cross sectional area , and @xmath33 is the transmission probability at the longitudinal energy @xmath34 .",
    "now , we can verify eqs .",
    "( [ sone ] ) and ( [ si_fd ] ) for two practical cases : thermionic emission and field emission .      when the potential barrier is wide on the scale of the wavelength , one can neglect tunneling . in this case ,",
    "an appreciable emission current can be achieved , for instance , by heating the emitter , so that thermally excited electrons escape above the barrier .",
    "the transmission probability takes the values 1 for @xmath35 and 0 for @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the barrier height ( quantum reflection for overbarrier electrons is negligible for a sufficiently smooth potential ) .",
    "thus the partition term vanishes and the noise contains only the emission ( thermionic ) contribution : @xmath38 where the summation is taken for open channels only . for wide multichannel emitters with equilibrium fermi - dirac electrons [ see eq .",
    "( [ si_fd ] ) ] , eq .",
    "( [ sone_em ] ) is reduced to @xmath39.\\ ] ] this formula gives the @xmath6 schottky value , whenever @xmath40 , which is a condition for a nondegenerate maxwell - boltzmann injection ( richardson - laue - dushman regime of thermionic emission @xcite ) . for a degenerate injection , @xmath41 , the noise is suppressed below the schottky value by the factor @xcite @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the fermi - dirac integral of index @xmath45 .",
    "this suppression is caused by fermi correlations imposed by the pauli exclusion principle ( see ref .   for the details ) .",
    "note that for metallic cathodes used in vacuum tubes , @xcite the work function is about 4 ev , which is much larger with respect to @xmath46 , so that only nondegenerate injection with the full shot noise is possible , @xcite as was observed in the experiment . @xcite      the potential barrier at the emitter can be narrowed by applying a strong electric field , so that electrons can be pulled out from the cold emitter via quantum tunneling .",
    "@xcite in this case , the partition noise is expected to be the dominating source of noise : @xmath47 by applying this formula again to fermi - dirac electrons in a wide emitter under the condition @xmath48 , we obtain the noise which is independent of temperature , @xmath49\\ , \\left(1-\\frac{e}{e_f}\\right)\\ , de.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the fowler - nordheim regime of field emission , @xcite when the fermi energy of the emitter is much below the barrier top , the transmission probability for electrons at the fermi level ( which mostly contribute to the emission ) is small , @xcite @xmath50 .",
    "it can be verified that in this regime , eq .  ( [ si_fd0 ] )",
    "gives the schottky @xmath6 law .",
    "summarizing these two examples , one can conclude that the schottky noise , which is the noise produced by independently injected electrons ( poissonian process ) , may occur under two physically different conditions : @xcite ( i ) the low occupation numbers , @xmath51 , when electrons are initially poissonian and remain poissonian after passing the barrier with whatever probability ; ( ii ) the low transmission probability , @xmath50 , when the incoming electrons may be initially noiseless , but after tunneling through the barrier , the outgoing flow becomes diluted and obeys a poissonian statistics .",
    "although in both cases , the noise power is given by the schottky law @xmath0 , in the former case its value is sensitive to the temperature , while in the latter case it is not .",
    "this fact may be used in the experiment to distinguish these two mechanisms .",
    "now it is clear under which conditions one should expect a deviation from the @xmath6 law .",
    "it is the case when both the occupation numbers @xmath19 and the transmission probabilities @xmath4 are not small with respect to 1 .",
    "this is precisely the situation that may occur in novel field emitters .",
    "the requirements of strong electric currents under low voltages led research interests towards low - work - function materials ( low potential barriers ) and sharp emitter tips ( narrow potential barriers ) . for instance ,",
    "extremely high electric fields @xmath52 are achieved in nanotube emitters due to a geometric field enhancement in high - aspect - ratio tips .",
    "@xcite for combinations of work function , field , and temperature parameters in many of these emitters , an appreciable part of electron emission originates from energy levels in the vicinity ( below and above ) of the potential barrier . to estimate the noise in this case",
    ", one should use general formulas given by eq .",
    "( [ sone ] ) or ( [ si_fd ] ) , in which the transmission coefficients must be known in a wide energy range , below and above the barrier .",
    "in this paper , we consider the model that consists of a simplified triangular representation of the barrier with only two parameters : the height of the barrier @xmath37 and the slope determined by the electric field @xmath53 : @xmath54 the potential barrier height @xmath37 is equal to the electron affinity for semiconductors , and for metals it is a sum of the work function and the chemical potential . @xcite we neglect the rounding off the barrier due to the image interaction .",
    "although this may cause some quantitative error , such a consideration enables the exact solution of the schrdinger equation in terms of airy functions and thus an exact evaluation of the electron transmission probability in the whole energy range including the barrier top , which is not allowed in the wkb scheme .",
    "@xcite the transmission probability @xmath33 for an arbitrary incident energy @xmath55 ( below and above the barrier top ) can be represented by a unique analytical formula ( see the appendix ) .",
    "= 8.0 cm    to illustrate the results for the current emission noise , consider the emitter at @xmath56=300 k with @xmath57 in which , for simplicity , the electron effective mass for the emitter and the barrier is the same",
    ". the noise spectral densities @xmath58 calculated from eq .",
    "( [ si_fd ] ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fsi - f ] as functions of the electric field @xmath53 for different barrier heights ( work functions ) @xmath59 .",
    "the zero - field limit @xmath60 corresponds to the emission over a rectangular - step barrier with no tunneling , for which @xmath61 . in this limit , the noise power is determined by the relative position of the fermi level with respect to the barrier top . for @xmath62  ev , the injection is nondegenerate and , consequently , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "their sum gives the full schottky noise : @xmath65 . since the transmission probabilities are not exactly equal to 1 for all the energies @xmath35 ( there is a finite reflection due to a sharp potential change ) , both terms contribute to the noise .",
    "it is also seen from fig .",
    "[ fsi - f ] that for @xmath66  ev , the noise at low fields is expected to be smaller than the schottky value .",
    "this is the case of a degenerate injection , for which the quadratic terms @xmath67 in the two contributions do not cancel , in contrast to the previous case of a nondegenerate injection .",
    "the noise suppression effect here originates from the fermi statistical correlations under the condition of current partitioning .",
    "although the case @xmath68  ev for the field emitters is likely to occur , @xcite the most typical case in practice is the opposite condition @xmath69  ev . in this case , at low fields , the current noise is the full schottky noise .",
    "our prediction is that when the electric field increases , there exists a threshold value , at which the noise starts to drop down the schottky value ( see fig .",
    "[ fsi - f ] ) .",
    "it can be explained by the fact that as the electric field increases , the barrier becomes thinner , the transmission probability increases , and the noise starts to drop down due to the @xmath5 factor [ see eq .",
    "( [ si_fd0 ] ) ] .",
    "it is worth noting that this drop is a quantum phenomenon .",
    "the quantum uncertainty of whether the electron has been transmitted through or reflected by the barrier is a source of randomness which produces the partition noise @xmath70 . for pure classical transmission ,",
    "when the probabilities of transmission at different energies are either 0 or 1 , the quantum partition noise does not appear and the noise of the emitted electrons is governed by the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ si_fd ] ) which gives the @xmath6 law with no drop .",
    "we would like to highlight that the suppression effect caused by quantum partitioning is independent of the degeneracy of electrons . even for a fully degenerate case at zero temperature ,",
    "for which electrons initially are noiseless , after passing the barrier they acquire a partition noise with a suppression level sensitive to the transmission coefficient .    the threshold value for the electric field , for which the shot - noise suppression becomes clearly visible , may be roughly estimated from eq .",
    "( [ te ] ) by taking the value for the tunneling probability at the fermi energy to be @xmath71 .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fsi - f ] that for the work function 4 ev , this threshold field is about @xmath72 , for the work function 3 ev , it is @xmath73 , and for 2 ev , it is @xmath74 , values that do not seem unrealistic .",
    "@xcite the threshold field may also be decreased by choosing the emitter with a high effective mass of electrons ( e.g. , of heavy - fermion materials ) , since the transmission probability ( [ te ] ) is sensitive to the ratio of the effective masses .",
    "the barrier lowering due to a self - consistent potential redistribution may also decrease the threshold field value .",
    "note that for negative affinity materials , the quantum suppression of shot noise should be observed for arbitrarily small fields .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the shot noise power of electron emission under the action of strong applied electric fields . within the landauer - bttiker scheme",
    ", we have shown that the emission noise is governed by two different stochastic processes acting together  thermal agitations and quantum partitioning .",
    "the analytical formula for the noise power , which unifies these two sources of randomness , has been analyzed .",
    "this formula , in the limit of a wide potential barrier ( no tunneling ) , describes the shot noise of thermionic emission , which may be either poissonian for a nondegenerate injection ( richardson - laue - dushman regime ) , or non - poissonian for a degenerate injection . under field - emission conditions ,",
    "the noise recovers the full schottky noise in the fowler - nordheim regime .",
    "our results indicate that in order to observe the shot - noise suppression in field emitters below the schottky level , there are at least two possibilities : ( i ) by lowering the work function @xmath75 ; then , the noise starts to be sub - poissonian below some value @xmath75 at arbitrarily small fields ; ( ii ) for high - work - function materials , by increasing the electric field @xmath53 at the emitter tip , e.g. , by employing the nanotube emitters ; then , the noise starts to be sub - poissonian above some threshold value @xmath53 .",
    "note that precisely in the regime when the shot noise deviates from the schottky law , the fowler - nordheim plots [ @xmath76 vs @xmath77 no longer follow the straight lines .",
    "@xcite the measurements of the noise suppression value ( with respect to the poissonian value ) may provide additional data on the work function and the electric field at the emitter tip  important information not available from the current - voltage characteristics alone ( especially for new unknown materials ) .",
    "@xcite since the noise is sensitive to the injection energy profile , @xcite the noise measurements may serve as a substitution for direct field - emission energy profile measurements .",
    "it is clear why the quantum partitioning has not been observed in noise measurements on metal - cathode vacuum tubes a long time ago , at the earlier stages of the development of vacuum electronics .",
    "@xcite in those experiments , the electric - field values at the emitter were no more than 0.003 v / nm , which is too low to see the effect on 4 ev work function materials .",
    "we are not aware of shot - noise measurements under field emission at stronger fields .",
    "the typical values obtained from old literature @xcite indicate fields of about 25 v / nm , and in novel nanotube field emitters they are even greater .",
    "@xcite we believe that in such conditions , the quantum suppression of shot noise is observable . besides the nanotube emitters , the suitable candidates to observe the shot - noise suppression could be the composite emitters coated by wide - band - gap , low - work - function , and/or negative - electron - affinity materials , @xcite or diamond - like emitters .",

    "the transmission coefficient can be found as a solution of the scattering problem for a one - dimensional potential barrier , since it depends only on the energy of the longitudinal motion @xmath55 .",
    "the time - independent schrdinger equation is given by @xmath78 in which the potential @xmath79 is defined by eq .",

    "since we calculate the transmission , the solution @xmath90 corresponds to the outgoing wave at @xmath91 .",

    "the incident and transmitted current densities corresponding to the wave functions ( [ psi ] ) are found as @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
