    "according to the instanton liquid model ( ilm ) instantons are largely responsible for the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and the low energy properties of light hadrons @xcite .",
    "this has been demonstrated using phenomenological instanton liquid models .",
    "the two main tasks involved in the construction are    * producing an equilibrium instanton ensemble assuming some interaction between the pseudoparticles .",
    "this is typically done with a variational calculation @xcite . * computing hadronic observables using the above instanton ensemble as the gauge background .",
    "this is a formidable task and the computation necessarily involves several approximations .",
    "it would thus be very desirable to check the physical picture emerging from the ilm , starting from first principles .    in the last few years",
    "there has been a considerable effort in this direction , using lattice simulations of qcd as a tool .",
    "the properties of the instanton ensemble have been extracted from monte carlo generated lattice configurations using several different `` smoothing '' techniques .",
    "the most important parameters , the topological susceptibility , the instanton density , and the average instanton size were found to be in qualitative agreement with the ilm . on the other hand",
    " although there is a considerable amount of indirect evidence @xcite  so far the lattice has not given any direct results concerning the second part of the above programme .    in ref .",
    "@xcite cooled lattice configurations were used to show that low eigenmodes of the dirac operator saturate the point - to - point hadronic correlators .",
    "more recently a strong correlation was found between the chiral density of low modes of the staggered dirac operator and the topological charge density @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that instantons probably really play an important role in qcd .",
    "all this work however has involved monte carlo generated or cooled lattices that contained other gauge field fluctuations in addition to the instantons .",
    "therefore , based solely on these studies it is impossible to separate the part of the effects due to the instantons and the part ( if any ) that is due to the rest of the gauge field fluctuations .    to my knowledge , the only lattice study so far that makes such a separation possible has appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", the instanton content of smoothed gauge configurations was reconstructed .",
    "hadron spectroscopy done on these artificial instanton backgrounds was compared to the spectroscopy on the corresponding smoothed configurations .",
    "while the smoothed ensemble yielded physically reasonable results for the pion and the rho mass , the instantons failed to reproduce this .",
    "in fact wilson spectroscopy on the instanton ensemble was hardly different from free field theory ( trivial gauge field background ) . in view of the positive results cited above",
    ", this was highly unexpected , especially that at first sight the only difference between the compared two ensembles appeared to be the presence versus the lack of confinement on the smoothed and the artificial instanton ensembles respectively . according to the ilm , confinement is not essential for the low energy properties of light hadrons @xcite",
    ". the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite indeed suggest that the physics in the chiral limit is rather insensitive to the string tension . with less than half of the original string tension ,",
    "the low fermion modes on the cooled configurations still produced physically sensible hadron correlators .    in the present paper",
    "i address the question of how to reconcile the insensitivity of light hadrons to the string tension ( also expected from the ilm ) with the failure of the instantons alone to reproduce the correct physics ( found in @xcite ) .",
    "i will exclusively consider the su(2 ) gauge group . along the way i will also obtain some useful insight into the structure of the low end of the spectrum of lattice dirac operators and in particular i will show the importance of using a ( close to ) chiral lattice dirac operator .",
    "this is essential for a faithful reproduction of continuum - like quark ( quasi)zero modes .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ se : zmz ]",
    "i briefly discuss the instanton liquid picture of physics in the chiral limit , and in particular the role of the zero modes and the so called `` zero mode zone '' . in section",
    "[ se : cs ] i point out the role of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking of the lattice dirac operator and the importance of minimising it .",
    "i show that the optimised clover dirac operator introduced in @xcite performs much better in this respect than the wilson operator .",
    "i explicitly study the zero mode zone in the simplest nontrivial case , that of an instanton antiinstanton pair and find that the mixing of zero modes closely follows the pattern expected in the continuum .    in section [ se : spectrum ]",
    "i find that the optimised clover operator produces spectroscopy results markedly different from the wilson operator but it still falls short of reproducing the correct physics on the instanton backgrounds .",
    "instead , it yields a peculiar mixture of qcd and free field theory .",
    "i demonstrate that this is due to the presence of a large number of low lying free field modes in the spectrum of the dirac operator with the instanton backgrounds that produce artificially light hadrons .",
    "the free modes are completely absent from the smoothed configurations .",
    "they can be also eliminated from the instanton configurations by superimposing an ensemble of zero momentum gauge field fluctuations ( torons ) over the instantons .",
    "these gauge field fluctuations survive even deep in the perturbative regime .",
    "i argue that they are probably needed to compensate for the anomalously large small - volume effects present in the instanton ensemble due to the lack of confinement . by comparing the density of eigenvalues around zero on the physical ( smoothed ) , the toron , and toron plus instanton ensembles ,",
    "i obtain direct evidence that the instantons are responsible for chiral symmetry breaking . after the elimination of the free quark modes ,",
    "the instanton backgrounds are shown to reproduce the correct physical pion and rho correlators .",
    "section [ se : con ] contains my conclusions along with some speculations on still unanswered questions .",
    "finally , in the appendix , for reference i collected some general properties of wilson type lattice dirac operators that i used in the main text .",
    "some of these can be also found in the literature .",
    "in this section i describe how instantons can produce low lying modes of the dirac operator and why this is important for the physics in the chiral limit . for simplicity",
    "i start with the continuum theory and in the second part of this section i discuss the complications that appear on the lattice .",
    "let @xmath0 be the continuum massless dirac operator which implicitly depends on a gauge field background .",
    "the basic building block of the physics in the chiral limit is the @xmath1 limit of the massive quark propagator , @xmath2 . from the spectral decomposition in terms of eigenmodes of @xmath0 @xmath3",
    "it is easily seen that in the chiral limit the most important modes are the ones with eigenvalues @xmath4 close to 0 .",
    "the crucial assumption of the ilm is that it is the instantons that are responsible for generating the bulk of these lowest eigenmodes .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood as follows .",
    "according to the atiyah - singer index theorem , in the background of an instanton ( antiinstanton ) @xmath0 has at least one negative ( positive ) chirality zero mode . in the presence of an infinitely separated instanton antiinstanton pair",
    "we still expect to find opposite chirality zero modes localised on the two objects .",
    "if the members of the pair are brought closer to one another , the two degenerate zero eigenvalues will in general split into two complex ones still close to the origin .",
    "a very simplistic but qualitatively correct description of this can be given as follows .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be the zero modes of the dirac operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively . since we consider @xmath0 in different gauge backgrounds , we explicitly indicate this ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 refer to an instanton and an antiinstanton .",
    "we now want to describe the spectrum of @xmath11 where @xmath12 is some superposition of the gauge fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 . since @xmath5 and @xmath6 are of opposite chirality , @xmath13 .",
    "let us arbitrarily complete the set of these two vectors into an orthonormal basis and construct the matrix of @xmath11 in this basis .",
    "the elements of this matrix in the subspace spanned by @xmath5 and @xmath6 are @xmath14 where @xmath15 the diagonal matrix elements vanish because @xmath0 maps left handed vectors into right handed ones and vice versa . by a suitable choice of the phases ,",
    "the off - diagonal elements can always be made real and due to the anti - hermiticity of @xmath0 they are of equal magnitude and have opposite signs .",
    "if we now assume that @xmath16 and @xmath17 lie approximately in this two - dimensional subspace , i.e. the matrix of @xmath11 contains the above @xmath18 block - diagonal part , then @xmath11 can be easily seen to have two complex conjugate eigenvalues @xmath19 with the corresponding ( unnormalised ) eigenvectors being @xmath20 .",
    "this mechanism can be generalised to gauge fields which are superpositions of several instantons and antiinstantons .",
    "the basis in this case consists of the zero modes of the individual ( anti)instantons . the only additional approximation involved is the assumption that the zero modes corresponding to different ( anti)instantons are orthogonal .",
    "if the pseudoparticles are well separated , this is approximately true .",
    "one can thus consider the matrix of @xmath0 restricted to the subspace of zero modes  called the `` zero mode zone ''  in a general instanton background .",
    "if the off diagonal elements of this matrix are small then it will have complex eigenvalues close to the origin , in addition to a number of exact zero eigenvalues corresponding to the total topological charge .",
    "moreover , the complex eigenmodes will be approximately linear combinations of several instanton and antiinstanton zero modes and thus become highly delocalised , making it possible to propagate quarks to large distances .    the most important quantities in this construction",
    "are the off diagonal instanton antiinstanton matrix elements , the @xmath21 s . in the simplest case of only one pair",
    ", @xmath21 is known to depend on the distance and the relative orientation of the members of the pair as @xmath22 where @xmath23 describes the relative orientation in group space , @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the relative position of the instanton and the antiinstanton @xcite .",
    "@xmath26 is a function of the instanton and antiinstanton scale parameters and the distance between them . at small distances",
    "it depends on the ansatz used to combine the field of the instanton and the antiinstanton , at large separation it is expected to fall off as @xmath27 .",
    "we have seen how instanton zero modes can give rise to the low - lying eigenmodes that are the most important ones in the chiral limit .",
    "close to the chiral limit the number of modes giving a substantial contribution to the quark propagator becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "it is thus crucial to reproduce these low eigenmodes and eigenvalues as faithfully as possible on the lattice if we want to test the ilm .",
    "the most important obstruction to this is that due to the nielsen - ninomiya theorem it is impossible to construct a local lattice dirac operator describing one fermion species with exact chiral symmetry @xcite . in the present paper",
    "i shall limit the discussion to wilson type lattice dirac operators that describe one fermion species but explicitly break chiral symmetry . in the absence of chiral symmetry",
    "the fermion zero modes corresponding to the topology of the gauge field are not protected ; any small fluctuation of the gauge field can shift the zero eigenvalues .    in order to understand how this happens , a useful starting point is the following property shared by the lattice and the continuum dirac operator .",
    "let @xmath28 be an eigenvector of @xmath0 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath29 . if @xmath0 has no degeneracies then",
    "@xmath30 if and only if @xmath29 is real .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the so - called `` @xmath31 hermiticity '' , @xmath32 , a common property of the continuum and the lattice dirac operator .",
    "a proof of the above statement is given in the appendix .    in the continuum , @xmath0 is anti - hermitian and has eigenvalues on the imaginary axis .",
    "thus the only real eigenvalue it can have is 0 .",
    "chirality makes a sharp distinction between zero and non - zero modes in the continuum .",
    "zero modes have a chirality of @xmath33 while all the non - zero eigenmodes have zero chirality .",
    "since the eigenmodes and their chiralities depend continuously on the gauge field , zero modes are protected , they can not be shifted away from zero by continuous deformations of the gauge field .",
    "on the other hand , the lattice dirac operator is not anti - hermitian , and its eigenvalues are not constrained to be on the imaginary axis . while lattice zero modes are still protected from being shifted off the real axis by smooth deformations of the gauge field ( this would cause their chirality to jump to zero ) ,",
    "there is nothing preventing them from moving continuously along the real axis .",
    "indeed , a lattice dirac operator will in general not have any exact zero modes unless the gauge field is fine tuned .",
    "it is now clear that the lattice analogues of the continuum zero modes are real modes of the dirac operator . these have non - vanishing chiralities but in general their magnitude is smaller than 1 .",
    "the crucial role chiral symmetry plays in this discussion can be understood by noting that chiral symmetry of @xmath0 ( i.e. @xmath34 ) together with @xmath31 hermiticity would imply that @xmath0 is anti - hermitian and has protected zero modes .",
    "the smaller the explicit chiral symmetry breaking of @xmath0 is , the more its low lying spectrum will resemble that of an anti - hermitian operator . recently it has been shown that the closest a lattice dirac operator can come to being chirally symmetric is by obeying the ginsparg - wilson relation and thus having an ultralocal chirality breaking in the quark propagator @xcite . in this case",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0 lies on a circle in the complex plane passing through the origin .",
    "indeed the low end of this spectrum is almost on the imaginary axis and there are protected zero modes .",
    "i shall now discuss how the continuum description of the zero mode zone presented in the previous subsection has to be modified on the lattice .",
    "assume that there is an instanton on the lattice .",
    "in the limit when the instanton size goes to infinity ( in units of the lattice spacing ) , the instanton `` does not see '' the lattice at all , and the continuum description applies .",
    "the lattice dirac operator , @xmath7 has an exact zero eigenvalue with a corresponding @xmath35 chirality eigenmode @xmath5 . if the instanton is not infinitely large , the real eigenvalue gets shifted away from zero , its magnitude depends on the instanton size and the chirality breaking of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding eigenmode also becomes only an approximate eigenvector of @xmath31 and thus @xmath36 .",
    "let us now consider the dirac operator in the presence of an instanton antiinstanton pair .",
    "following the continuum discussion in the previous subsection , its matrix elements between the ( lattice approximate ) `` zero modes '' @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be parametrised as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is real , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are non - negative real numbers . in the su(2 ) case the diagonal elements are automatically real and the off - diagonal ones can be also made real by a suitable choice of the phases of the eigenvectors .",
    "this will be proved in the appendix . due to the @xmath31 hermiticity of @xmath0 , since @xmath5 and @xmath6 are approximate eigenvectors of @xmath31 , the off - diagonal terms have opposite signs and about the same magnitude .",
    "the eigenvalues of this matrix are @xmath41 with the corresponding ( unnormalised ) eigenvectors being @xmath42 the most important feature of these eigenvectors is that  as in the continuum  they are mixtures of the instanton and antiinstanton zero modes with roughly the same magnitude ( the ratio being @xmath43 ) and with a relative phase @xmath44 , up to a correction proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "this mechanism produces highly delocalised eigenmodes in the zero mode zone and thus facilitates the propagation of quarks by jumping from instanton to antiinstanton .",
    "maintaining this feature on the lattice is thus crucial for the description of the zero mode zone .",
    "the requirement for the proper mixing of zero modes is the inequality @xmath45 for producing qualitatively continuum - like eigenmodes , the difference of the diagonal elements has to be much smaller than the magnitude of the off - diagonal mixing matrix elements of @xmath11 .",
    "otherwise the two eigenvalues will be real and the corresponding eigenmodes rapidly become localised on the instanton and the antiinstanton respectively . recall that in the continuum ,",
    "the mixing matrix elements @xmath46 are proportional to @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the invariant angle of the instanton antiinstanton relative orientation ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : relor ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath38 ( and @xmath49 ) is expected to be of the order of the real eigenvalues of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , both small but nonzero numbers .",
    "this means that inequality ( [ eq : ineq ] ) will be violated for @xmath48 sufficiently close to @xmath50 .",
    "we can minimise the range in relative orientation , where this happens by making @xmath38 small , i.e. having the would - be zero modes close to zero .",
    "in this section i study how the general features of the zero mode zone described in the previous section are realised by two commonly used lattice dirac operators , the wilson and the clover operator .",
    "the gauge background i use for this test contains an instanton of size @xmath51 and an antiinstanton of size @xmath52 , separated by a distance @xmath53 in the time direction .",
    "the lattice size is @xmath54 and i always use antiperiodic boundary conditions in the time direction , periodic in all other directions .",
    "these parameters are typical in the spectroscopy calculations that i shall present in the next section .",
    "let me start with the wilson operator . in the presence of only the ( anti)instanton with the above parameters",
    ", @xmath55 has a real eigenvalue at ( 0.17 ) 0.51 with chirality ( 0.39 ) -0.53 .",
    "it is clear that for these small instantons the wilson operator does not even come close to satisfying the conditions of the previous section : the `` zero modes '' are far away from zero with chiralities of magnitude much smaller than 1 .",
    "the simplified description of the instanton - antiinstanton configuration in terms of the @xmath18 matrix is then inadequate .",
    "if the instanton and antiinstanton are close to being parallel @xmath56 then the real part of the ( anti)instanton related eigenvalues is around 0.3 .",
    "moreover already at @xmath57 the two complex eigenvalues become real and the corresponding modes are rather localised at the instanton and the antiinstanton respectively .",
    "a much better description of the zero mode zone is provided by the optimised clover action proposed in ref .",
    "( see also @xcite for more discussion and a recent scaling test of this action . )",
    "the clover coefficient was chosen to minimise the range in which the real eigenvalues occur in the physical branch of the spectrum on locally smooth gauge backgrounds . as explained in the previous section ,",
    "this is exactly what is needed for a good description of the mixing of zero modes .",
    "the optimal value for @xmath58 was found to be around 1.2 on a set of ape smeared @xmath59 quenched su(3 ) configurations .",
    "physically these are quite similar to the su(2 ) configurations appearing in the present study , therefore in what follows i shall always choose @xmath60 .",
    "the real modes occurring in the single ( anti)instanton background already reveal that the clover action is much closer to the continuum than the wilson action .",
    "the eigenvalues are located at -0.014 and -0.002 and the chiralities of the corresponding eigenmodes are 0.993 and -0.995 respectively . in the instanton plus antiinstanton background",
    "the lowest two modes are always complex for almost any relative orientation of the pair , even at @xmath61 .",
    "we can hope that the simple description in terms of the mixing matrix works well in this case .",
    "indeed , the magnitude of the diagonal elements is small , neither @xmath38 nor @xmath29 goes above 0.02 in magnitude for any relative orientation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : t12 ] i plotted the two off - diagonal matrix elements , @xmath62 versus @xmath48 along with the one - parameter fits of the form const.@xmath63 . as expected ,",
    "the mixing matrix elements are very well described by the continuum ansatz of eq.([eq : relor ] ) .",
    "a comparison of the eigenvalues of the @xmath18 mixing matrix and the explicitly computed eigenvalues of the lattice dirac operator in the corresponding gauge backgrounds shows agreement to within @xmath64 in the whole range of @xmath65 .",
    "we can conclude that the @xmath60 clover operator should give a satisfactory treatment of the zero mode zone as long as the instanton size does not drop below around @xmath51 .",
    "this is of course true only if the gauge configuration is locally smooth .",
    "otherwise the fermion mass acquires an additive renormalisation which completely destroys the above features important for the description of the zero mode zone .",
    "having a fermion action that is expected to describe the zero modes and their mixing reasonably well , we can discuss the main topic of the paper , namely , what part of qcd is reproduced by instantons alone . in this section",
    "i present quenched hadron spectroscopy results obtained with the @xmath60 clover fermion action .",
    "the gauge field backgrounds on which the spectroscopy is done are the ones used in ref .",
    "the starting point is a set of 28 @xmath54 su(2 ) configurations generated with a fixed point action .",
    "the lattice spacing is @xmath66fm , as fixed by the sommer parameter of the heavy quark potential . these monte carlo generated configurations are not yet suitable for our purposes since they are not locally `` smooth '' .",
    "both the instantons and the details of the zero mode zone are obscured by short distance fluctuations .",
    "cycling , a smoothing technique based on the renormalisation group , has been shown to preserve the main physical features of the gauge configurations .",
    "after 9 cycling steps the string tension @xcite and @xmath67 versus @xmath68 are essentially unchanged .",
    "moreover , these lattices are smooth enough that their instanton content can be unambiguously identified .",
    "in fact , about @xmath69 of the action is accounted for by instantons ( assuming there is no interaction between them ) .",
    "we can create artificial lattice configurations that have the same instanton content as the smoothed ones .",
    "the instanton sizes and locations are reproduced but the relative orientation in group space is distributed according to the su(2 ) haar measure .",
    "recently a study of the relative orientation appeared in @xcite , however reproducing the relative orientations would make our procedure much more cumbersome .",
    "i compare the spectroscopy done on the smoothed ( cycled ) lattices and the corresponding artificial instanton configurations with the same instanton content .",
    "these ensembles are both locally smooth enough that the optimised clover action should give a satisfactory description of their zero mode zone . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pirho ] the vector meson mass is plotted as a function of the pseudoscalar mass for both ensembles .",
    "the correlators were always fitted with the assumption that there is only one lightest particle dominating both the pseudoscalar and the vector channels .",
    "i also show the @xmath70 free field line .",
    "in fact , the wilson fermion action produces exactly degenerate free field like pions and rhos on the instanton backgrounds .",
    "compared to the wilson action , the clover action shows a marked improvement , but it still fails to reproduce the @xmath67 vs.  @xmath68 observed on the smoothed lattices .",
    "[ fig : pi ] shows the pion mass sqared vs.  the bare quark mass for both ensembles . on the smoothed ensemble @xmath71 , as expected from pcac .",
    "this is clearly not the case on the instanton ensemble , where a best fit to the form @xmath72 gives @xmath73 which is between @xmath74 and the free field value , @xmath75 .",
    "we also note that since both ensembles are locally very smooth , the additive mass renormalisations are very close to zero .",
    "therefore , it is also meaningful to compare hadron masses obtained at the same bare quark mass on the two gauge ensembles .",
    "this comparison reveals that the instanton ensemble typically produces much lighter hadrons than the smoothed ensemble .      in spite of its substantially improved chiral properties ,",
    "even the clover dirac operator fails to reproduce the correct physics of qcd on the instanton backgrounds .",
    "instead , it yields a peculiar mixture of qcd and free field theory .",
    "is there a problem with the instanton liquid model or the physics of these instanton lattices is still not close enough to the continuum ? to answer this question we look at the low lying eigenmodes of the dirac operator in more detail .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dspec ] i plot the lowest 30 eigenvalues in the complex plane for the instanton and the smoothed ensemble .",
    "the eigenvalues of all 28 configurations are superimposed .",
    "the boundary condition is antiperiodic in the time direction , periodic in all other directions . in both cases",
    "most of the eigenvalues lie very close to a circle passing through the origin .",
    "this is a sign of the approximate chiral symmetry of the action .",
    "the most striking difference between the two ensembles is the appearance of a gap at around im@xmath29=0.5 on the instanton ensemble .",
    "it is also instructive to compare the density of eigenvalues . since the low eigenvalues",
    "are almost imaginary i project them on the imaginary axis and plot the densities as a function of the imaginary part of the eigenvalues .",
    "this corresponds to the density of eigenvalues around zero in the continuum .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ev_hist1 ] we can compare the densities corresponding to the two ensembles .",
    "the real modes have been removed , these would show up as spikes at the origin .",
    "the densities at zero seem to agree quite well . according to the banks - casher relation",
    "the chiral condensate is proportional to the density of modes around zero @xcite ( excluding exact zero modes , which do not contribute in the infinite volume limit ) .",
    "this shows that on both the instanton and the smoothed ensemble chiral symmetry is broken and the value of the chiral condensate is approximately the same .",
    "apart from the vicinity of the origin , however , the two distributions are quite different . on the instanton ensemble",
    "there is a substantial `` piling up '' of modes above im(@xmath76 and then a `` thinning '' of modes at 0.5 .",
    "what is the reason of this huge difference between the two distributions ?",
    "the answer can be easily given by looking at the eigenvectors of the dirac operator .",
    "it turns out that the quark density of the eigenvectors on the instanton ensemble corresponding to the peak of the distribution are much more delocalised than all the other eigenvectors occurring in either ensemble .",
    "in fact , these modes are essentially free quark modes .",
    "this can be seen as follows . on a trivial gauge field configuration ( all links are 1 ) with periodic bondary conditions in all directions , there are @xmath77 trivial ( constant ) zero modes , this is the number of c - number degrees of freedom corresponding to one fermion flavour . in the presence of antiperiodic boundary condition in the time direction , the lowest eigenmodes are shifted away from zero , to @xmath78 since in our case @xmath79 .",
    "both eigenvalues are @xmath77-fold degenerate .",
    "the mixing of the free field modes into a particular eigenmode @xmath28 can be characterised by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the projection of the normalised eigenmode @xmath28 onto the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath82 .",
    "this quantity is not gauge invariant therefore i work in landau gauge . any generic fermion mode on a non - trivial but locally smooth configuration",
    "will have a nonzero projection on the @xmath82 eigenspaces .",
    "the question is whether this is just an accidental mixing or the given ensemble really contains close to free field modes . to decide this ,",
    "a good quantity to look at is @xmath83 .",
    "if the mixing is accidental , we expect @xmath84 to fluctuate around 1 , independently of the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath29 . on the other hand , if there are free field like modes on a given configuration then @xmath84 will increase substantially when @xmath29 approaches the free field eigenvalue @xmath85 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : proj ] i plotted @xmath84 versus the distance of the given eigenvalue from the free field mode @xmath85 .",
    "the figure shows a random selection of eigenvalues with imaginary parts between 0.0 and 0.2 . in the smoothed ensemble @xmath84",
    "fluctuates around 1 everywhere , there is no trace of the free field modes . on the other hand , in the instanton ensemble",
    ", the modes close to @xmath85 have a substantially larger projection on the @xmath85 eigenspace than on the @xmath86 subspace .",
    "in fact , these modes , close to @xmath85 have @xmath87 , so they are essentially free field modes .",
    "a detailed study of the chiral density @xmath88 reveals that all the modes with @xmath89 look like mixtures of instanton zero modes with the density concentrated in several lumps .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the chiral density of the modes with @xmath90 that spreads almost homogenously over the whole lattice , as expected of the lowest free field eigenmodes .",
    "now we can understand why the instanton ensemble gave substantially smaller hadron masses than the smoothed ensemble .",
    "the reason is that the former had a large number of free quark modes .",
    "even if the zero mode zones of the two ensembles are similar , the free field modes provide a very efficient way to propagate quarks to large distances .",
    "this is why the instanton ensemble shows a peculiar mixture of qcd and free field characteristics . in the smoothed ensemble confinement",
    "completely eliminates the freely propagating quarks .      according to the instanton liquid model , instantons alone , without confinement ,",
    "can reproduce most of the properties of the light hadrons .",
    "our result shows that in the presence of instantons only , without confinement , free quark modes provide a very effective way to propagate quarks and they contaminate the hadron correlators producing unusually light hadrons .    one possible way to suppress the free quark modes",
    "is to add to the instantons some locally very smooth background that contains only long wavelength fluctuations .",
    "there has to be enough long distance structure to suppress the free propagation of quarks but on the other hand they have to be locally smooth enough not to distort the instantons .",
    "cycling is a very efficient way to create such backgrounds . to this end",
    "i started with an ensemble of wilson @xmath91 ( @xmath92fm ) @xmath93 su(2 ) gauge configurations , performed 4 cycling steps and finally inverse blocked them to size @xmath54 .",
    "this produced a set of lattices extremely smooth on the few lattice spacing scale but containing the longest wavelength fluctuations characteristic to a @xmath94@xmath95 lattice .",
    "their spatial size was a bit smaller , their temporal size a bit larger than the confinement scale .",
    "moreover these configurations had a small enough physical size that they almost never contained instantons .",
    "after superimposing these lattices on the instanton configurations by simply multiplying the corresponding links ( in landau gauge ) , i checked that the original topological charge of the instanton configurations changed very little .    to show how the addition of the smooth background affects the hadron correlators , in fig .",
    "[ fig : pirho_b2.4 ] i plotted typical pseudoscalar and vector correlators ( at @xmath96 ) .",
    "the change is dramatic .",
    "while on the instanton configurations the pion and the rho are very light ( crosses ) , the addition of the smooth background brings the correlators ( bursts ) very close to the physical ones obtained on the smoothed lattices ( boxes ) .",
    "the good agreement of the physical correlators and the instanton plus smooth background correlators persists in the whole range of masses where i tested it ( @xmath97 )",
    ".    it would be tempting to interpret this as a consequence of confinement ; the superimposed smooth backgrounds still contained the longest scale fluctuations of the confining lattices and these removed the free field modes that contaminated the spectroscopy before .",
    "but is confinement really needed for that ?",
    "this can be easily tested by replacing the superimposed backgrounds with ones of much smaller physical size .",
    "the lattices that i used for this purpose were generated in exactly the same way as before , except that the starting @xmath98 lattices were produced at wilson @xmath99 .",
    "these lattices have a tiny physical size , they are expected to be completely perturbative . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pirho_b3.0 ] i plotted again the pion and rho correlators at @xmath96 .",
    "quite surprisingly , the correlators have absolutely no dependence on the @xmath100 at which the background was created , they are the same on the instantons plus confining and instantons plus perturbative configurations .    apparently , there is still something nontrivial on these physically very tiny perturbative lattices that has the same effect on the correlators as a confining background . what could this be ?",
    "the answer can be given by noting that the @xmath101 limit of yang - mills theory on the torus is not completely trivial because there is not only one gauge field configuration with zero action .",
    "the set of flat ( minimal action ) gauge field configurations can be characterised by the su(2 ) conjugacy classes represented by four mutually commuting gauge group elements corresponding to the ( constant ) polyakov loops in the four perpendicular directions .",
    "these are essentially zero momentum gauge field configurations , with a constant gauge potential ( link ) , sometimes referred to as torons .",
    "their contribution to physical quantities is a finite size effect , and has been estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to explicitly check that it is really the torons that affect the correlators so strongly , i extracted the `` toron content '' of the perturbative background fields .",
    "this was done in the following way .",
    "after landau gauge fixing i averaged the polyakov loops in all four directions . since the polyakov loops along any given direction were almost constant ( up to small perturbative fluctuations ) , the averages were close to being su(2 ) elements .",
    "i projected the averages back onto su(2 ) and then distributed the average polyakov loop evenly among the links in the given direction .",
    "this resulted in configurations with constant gauge fields ( links in any direction ) that carried the average polyakov loops of the original perturbative configurations .",
    "i shall refer to these lattices as `` toron '' configurations .",
    "we can now compare the correlators in the instantons plus toron background and the instantons plus the full perturbative background . the result",
    " again in the typical case of @xmath96  is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toron ] .",
    "the instantons and the torons together fully reproduce the correlators , demonstrating that the most important fluctuations on the perturbative lattices are indeed the torons .",
    "it is also quite instructive to compare the distribution of the lowest eigenvalues of the dirac operator on the different types of gauge configurations .",
    "[ fig : bc_hist ] shows the densities on the smoothed lattices ( solid lines ) , the perturbative ones ( dotted line ) and the lattices containing both the instantons and the perturbative backgrounds ( dashed line ) .",
    "the three distributions agree quite well away from zero .",
    "however around zero , the perturbative ensemble produces only a very low density ( compatible with zero ) , while the two other ensembles yield qualitatively similar densities , both nonzero .",
    "this demonstrates very clearly that it is the instantons that are responsible for creating a nonzero eigenvalue density around zero which through the banks - casher relation @xcite implies the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "we also note that the peak corresponding to the free field modes ( see fig .  [ fig : ev_hist1 ] ) has been completely eliminated by the perturbative backgrounds .",
    "this again can be attributed to the torons , as can be checked by looking at the eigenvalue distribution on the toron lattices ( not shown ) which is very similar to the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bc_hist ] .",
    "in the present paper i addressed the question of how much of qcd in the chiral limit is reproduced by restricting the fluctuations of the gauge field to instantons only .",
    "i reconstructed the instanton content of smoothed monte carlo lattice configurations and compared hadron spectroscopy on this instanton ensemble to the spectroscopy on the original `` physical '' smoothed configurations .",
    "the fermion action used for the spectroscopy was a `` chirally optimised '' clover action .",
    "i explicitly studied the fermion zero modes in the presence of an instanton and also the mixing of the zero modes corresponding to an instanton and an antiinstanton .",
    "i found that in these simple cases the optimised action described the continuum features of the zero mode zone rather well . in spite of this , the optimised action still failed to reproduce the physical hadron spectrum .",
    "it yielded anomalously light hadrons with a mixture of qcd and free - field like features .    a closer look at the spectrum of the dirac operator revealed that on the instanton ensemble it had a large number of free quark modes .",
    "these were absent on the physical smoothed configurations .",
    "they provided a very efficient way of propagating quarks to large distances thereby substantially reduced the hadron masses and contaminated the spectroscopy .",
    "superimposing an ensemble of very smooth , essentially perturbative gauge field fluctuations on the instantons , was enough to eliminate the free quark modes and to restore the physical hadron correlators . by comparing the density of low eigenvalues of the dirac operator",
    "i also obtained direct evidence that it is the instantons that are responsible for creating a nonzero density of modes around zero and by the banks - casher relation also for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the important fluctuations on the superimposed perturbative lattices , needed to recover the physical hadron correlators , turned out to be zero momentum ( constant link or gauge potential ) configurations , torons .",
    "i would like to emphasise here that this toron ensemble was a perturbative one , produced at large @xmath100 i.e. small physical lattice size .",
    "the meson correlators appeared to be largely independent of the @xmath100 at which the superimposed background was created , as long as it was above the finite temperature phase transition on the given lattice size .",
    "it seems rather surprising that such `` mild '' gauge field fluctuations as the torons , can have so profound an impact on physical quantities .",
    "after all , torons exist only on the torus , they are absent in an infinite space - time and thus constitute only finite size effects . on the other hand we know that the instantons by themselves do not confine @xcite .",
    "this means that the instanton ensemble does not produce a mass gap and it is expected to exhibit much stronger finite size effects than qcd , from which the instantons have been extracted . in fact , the free field modes that are eliminated by the torons are also absent in the infinite volume limit , since they are not normalisable .",
    "in free field theory the density of modes around zero is proportional to the linear size of the box @xmath102 , whereas the density of instanton related modes grows proportionally to the volume .",
    "it is thus not inconceivable that in increasingly bigger volumes , although the torons have less and less influence , at the same time they become less and less needed since the relative importance of the free field modes also dies out .",
    "the torons might be needed only for compensating the unnaturally large finite size effects due to the absence of confinement in the instanton ensemble .    what is the picture emerging from this lattice study concerning the instanton liquid model ?",
    "the qcd vacuum contains an ensemble of instantons that is generated by the non - perturbative gauge field dynamics .",
    "the instantons by themselves break chiral symmetry but hadron correlators in the instanton backgrounds are strongly contaminated by freely propagating quarks .",
    "this yields anomalously light mesons and a small splitting between the pseudoscalar and the vector channel .",
    "the free quarks can be eliminated and the physical hadron correlators can be restored by superimposing a perturbative ensemble of zero momentum gauge configurations ( torons ) on the instantons .",
    "this suggests that the contamination by free quarks is most likely a finite volume effect which , in qcd , is completely suppressed by confinement .    more evidence in favour of this scenario could be gathered by studying the volume dependence of these effects on larger volumes .",
    "another important question , not answered by the present study is why it is exactly the perturbative toron ensemble that is needed to restore the physical meson correlators .",
    "it would be also very desirable to extend this investigation to a larger class of observables , in particular baryon correlators , for which the su(3 ) case need be considered .",
    "finally , for more precise tests a better chiral action , such as the overlap @xcite could be used .",
    "in the appendix , for reference , i collected some properties of wilson type lattice dirac operators that were used in the main body of the paper .",
    "some of these results can be found in the literature , in particular in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "i assume that the dirac operator satisfies @xmath31 hermiticity , i.e. @xmath103    let @xmath0 be a @xmath31-hermitian dirac operator with no degeneracy in its spectrum , i.e.  having as many different eigenvalues as the dimension of the space it acts on .",
    "let @xmath29 , and @xmath49 be two eigenvalues of @xmath0 with the corresponding eigenvectors being @xmath28 and @xmath104 .",
    "then @xmath105 if and only if @xmath106 .",
    "_ proof : _ a simple consequence of @xmath31 hermiticity is that @xmath107 which implies",
    "@xmath108 it immediately follows that if @xmath109 then @xmath106 . to prove the converse we first note that since @xmath0 has as many different eigenvalues as the dimension of the space it acts on , its eigenvectors form a basis .",
    "we have already seen that the only eigenvector on which @xmath110 can have a nonzero projection , is @xmath111 .",
    "if this projection were also zero , then @xmath110 would be orthogonal to all the vectors in a complete set and consequently it would be zero .",
    "this is impossible since @xmath31 has a trivial kernel .    for proving that @xmath112 it was essential that the eigenvalues of @xmath0 be non - degenerate and its eigenvectors form a complete set .",
    "generally this is expected to be the case unless the gauge field is fine tuned .",
    "there is however an important exception . when topology",
    " as seen by the fermions  changes through a smooth deformation of the gauge fields , two opposite chirality real eigenvalues collide and leave the real axis as a complex conjugate pair .",
    "it can be shown that when the two eigenvalues coincide , the corresponding eigenspace is one - dimensional , the eigenvector has zero chirality , @xmath0 does not possess a complete set of eigenvectors and therefore has no spectral decomposition .",
    "a simple consequence of statement 1 is that if @xmath0 has a complete non - degenerate spectrum , then the chirality of an eigenvector , @xmath88 is nonzero if and only if the corresponding eigenvalue , @xmath29 , is real .    in the remainder of the appendix",
    "i shall prove the following property of wilson type su(2 ) lattice dirac operators .",
    "let @xmath113 and @xmath114 be real eigenvectors of two ( not necessarily the same ) su(2 ) lattice dirac operators such that the corresponding eigenvalues and their complex conjugates are non - degenerate .",
    "it is then possible to choose the phases of @xmath113 and @xmath114 such @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 are all real for any ( third ) lattice dirac operator @xmath0 .",
    "_ proof : _ besides @xmath31 hermiticity , this property depends on an additional symmetry of the dirac operator relating @xmath0 to its complex conjugate @xcite .",
    "this is specific to the su(2 ) case .",
    "let @xmath119 be the charge conjugation operator and @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is a pauli matrix acting in colour space . using that @xmath122 ( where the last equality follows because we work in a representation with all @xmath123 s hermitian ) , and that for any @xmath124 @xmath125 , it is not hard to prove that @xmath126 now if @xmath28 is an eigenvector of @xmath0 with eigenvalue @xmath29 then @xmath127 which means that @xmath128 is an eigenvector of @xmath0 with eigenvalue @xmath129 .",
    "due to the non - degeneracy of the eigenvalues and that @xmath130 , it follows that @xmath131 in the special case when @xmath29 is real , the phase choice @xmath132 eliminates the extra phase factor on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : phase ] ) .    now writing @xmath133 , and making use of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dstar ] ) and ( [ eq : phase ] ) with the above phase choice , the non - diagonal matrix elements can be easily seen to be real .",
    "the same argument also shows that the diagonal matrix elements are automatically real , regardless of the phase choice .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we would like to note that while any wilson type dirac operator has a spectrum symmetric with respect to the real axis ( this follows from @xmath31 hermiticity ) , in general there is no simple relation between the eigenvectors corresponding to complex conjugate eigenvalues .",
