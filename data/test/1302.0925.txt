    "the geodynamo is the process by which the rotating , convecting , electrically conducting molten iron in the earth s fluid core maintains the geomagnetic field against ohmic decay .",
    "the convective processes in the core that produce the velocity fields required for dynamo action are a combination of thermal and compositional convection .",
    "the full dynamo problem requires the examination of the full three dimensional partial differential equations governing convective , incompressible magnetohydrodyamics ( mhd ) . in the past decades",
    "computer models have been used to simulate the actual geodynamo .",
    "see , for example , the review articles by roberts et al on modeling the geodynamo  @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , as glatzmaier et al  @xcite remark , no three dimensional dynamo model has been run at the spatial resolution required to simulate the broad spectrum of turbulence which surely exists in the earth s fluid core .",
    "current computers and numerical methods require the imposition of diffusivities that are several orders of magnitude larger than those which are realistic .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to attempt to gain some insight into the geodynamo by considering a reduction of the full mhd equations to a system that is more tractable , but one that retains many of the essential features of the problem .",
    "the magnetogeostrophic equation proposed by moffatt and loper  @xcite is one such model",
    ". the physical postulates of this model are the following : slow cooling of the earth leads to slow solidification of the liquid metal core onto the solid inner core and releases latent heat of solidification that drives compositional convection in the fluid core .",
    "the arguments for the appropriate ranges of the characteristic length , velocity , and perturbation density are based on these physical postulates .",
    "we first present the full coupled three - dimensional mhd equations for the evolution of the velocity vector @xmath0 , the magnetic field vector @xmath1 and the buoyancy field @xmath2 in the boussinesq approximation and written in the frame of reference rotating with angular velocity @xmath3 .",
    "the physical forces governing this system are coriolis forces , lorentz forces , and gravity . following the notation of moffatt and loper  @xcite we write the equations in terms of dimensionless variables .",
    "the orders of magnitude of the resulting non - dimensional parameters are motivated by the physical postulates of the moffatt and loper model : @xmath4 = - \\nabla p +   { e}_2 \\cdot \\nabla b + r_m b\\cdot\\nabla b + n^2 \\theta   { e}_3 + \\eps \\delta u \\label{eq:1.1 } \\\\ & r_m \\left [ \\partial_t b + u \\cdot \\nabla b - b\\cdot \\nabla u\\right ] =   { e}_2 \\cdot \\nabla u + \\delta b \\label{eq:1.2 } \\\\ & \\partial_t \\theta + u \\cdot \\nabla \\theta = \\eps_\\kappa",

    "\\label{eq:1.4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath5 is a given smooth function that represents the forcing of the system .",
    "the mathematical statement of the geodynamo problem asks whether there are initial data for the mhd system for which the evolution of the perturbation of the magnetic field @xmath6 grows for sufficiently long time .",
    "this can be interpreted as a question of the existence of instabilities of .    the notation in  is the following .",

    ", we have assumed that the axis of rotation and the gravity @xmath9 are aligned in the direction of @xmath8 .",
    "we have assumed that the magnetic field @xmath1 consists of the sum of an underlying constant field @xmath10 and a perturbation @xmath6 .",
    "our choice of @xmath11 as the underlying magnetic field is consistent with the models where the magnetic field is believed to be predominantly toroidal ( cf .",

    "@xmath18 is the sum of the fluid and magnetic pressures , @xmath19 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath20 is the magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath21 is the molecular diffusivity of the compositional variation that creates an ambient density @xmath22 .",
    "the usual estimate for @xmath20 in the fluid core is @xmath23 .",
    "the values of @xmath19 and @xmath21 are speculative , but likely to be extremely small . for a more detailed discussion of plausible ranges of the physical parameters that are appropriate for the geodynamo",
    ", we refer the reader to the book of ghil and childress  @xcite .",
    "for the regions in the earth s fluid core modeled by moffatt and loper , it is argued that the dimensionless parameters are the following orders of magnitude .",
    "the inverse elsasser number @xmath24 will be of order unity , or somewhat less in the condition of the fluid core , while the rossby number @xmath25 is of order @xmath26 .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is somewhat uncertain since the viscosity @xmath19 is a matter of guess work , but plausibly @xmath28 in the core conditions .",
    "the inverse peclet number @xmath29 is also likely to be extremely small , perhaps of the order of @xmath30 .",
    "according to moffatt and loper  @xcite , the magnetic reynolds number @xmath31 is relatively small in the range of @xmath17 considered . with these estimates of the sizes of the parameters the dominant balance of the leading order terms in equations and give the following reduced system : @xmath32 along with the incompressibility condition @xmath33 the _ linear _ system of equations  determine the differential operators that relate the vector fields @xmath0 and @xmath6 with the scalar buoyancy @xmath2 .",

    "firstly , the functions are strongly anisotropic with respect to the dependence on the integers @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "this is a consequence of the interplay of the three above mentioned physical forces .",

    "thirdly , we have @xmath53 for any @xmath54 ( we use the standard summation convention on repeated indices ) , which is built into the system since the velocity field is divergence free @xmath55",
    "lastly , although the symbols @xmath49 are bounded ( by a constant that depends only on @xmath56 ) in regions of fourier space where @xmath57 , this is not the case in the `` curved '' regions where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 with @xmath60 . in such regions the symbols are unbounded as @xmath61 with @xmath62 that _ is independent of @xmath56 _ , and this bound is sharp .",
    "hence the mg equation falls in the class of abstract active scalar equations ( see  below ) where the relation between the divergence - free velocity field @xmath38 and the scalar @xmath16 is given as a singular operator of order @xmath63 .",

    "we recall that in the fluid core @xmath29 is positive but probably extremely small . in this case",
    "the mg equation is global well posed .",
    "to prove this fact we use the control on @xmath70 , a quantity that is non - increasing along solutions , and which gives a bound on the drift velocity @xmath38 in the space @xmath71 .",
    "the latter information on the drift is `` critical '' for the natural scaling of the _ linear _ drift - diffusion equation @xmath72 indeed , for @xmath73 divergence - free , we proved in @xcite that the solution @xmath16 of becomes hlder continuous in finite time , by appealing to the classical ideas of de giorgi  @xcite , in the spirit of  @xcite .",
    "this result was also established independently in  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite , the more recent  @xcite , and references therein , for regularity issues of linear parabolic equations with singular coefficients and divergence - free drift .",
    "the hlder continuity of solutions to the linear equation   may then be bootstrapped to show that the solutions of the dissipative mg equations become smooth in arbitrarily short finite time  @xcite .",
    "having established the global well - posedness of  for any @xmath69 , we can proceed to examine the stability of equilibria .",
    "we show that the existence of an unstable eigenvalue for the linearized equations implies nonlinear ( lyapunov ) instability of the nonlinear mg equation ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "we then exhibit the existence of an unstable eigenvalue in a particular example , using the method of continued fractions cf .",
    "the magnitude of this eigenvalue is @xmath74 which , in the context of the fluid core , is extremely large .",
    "thus the mg equation can be used to model very rapid exponential growth in time of @xmath16 , and hence , through  , of the perturbation velocity and magnetic fields , i.e. a dynamo type instability .",
    "we emphasize that this `` mg - dynamo '' instability requires the presence of all three forces  coriolis , lorentz , and gravity  because the dimensionless parameter @xmath24 ( defined above in ) must be strictly in the range @xmath75 .    in section  [ sec : inviscid ]",
    "we examine the non diffusive mg equation and set @xmath76 ( cf .",
    "the situation is then dramatically different from the case @xmath69 . without the laplacian to control the unbounded operator @xmath37 , the mg equation is _ ill - posed _ in the sense of hadamard in sobolev spaces .",
    "such a result utilizes in an essential way both the unboundedness of @xmath52 and the fact that it is an even function of @xmath77 .",
    "the proof again uses the existence of an unstable eigenvalue of the linearized equation , however when @xmath76 it is possible to construct such an eigenvalue that is arbitrarily large and it then follows that there is no lipschitz solution map at time @xmath78 ( see also  @xcite ) .    in section  [ sec : frac ]",
    "we describe results for the fractionally diffusive mg equation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. replace the laplacian by @xmath79 , for @xmath80 .",
    "this situation is non - physical but mathematically interesting in the context of the tools required to treat the fractional laplacian .",
    "we now have a dichotomy across the value @xmath81 . in the range @xmath82",
    "the equation is _ locally _ well - posed , while it is hadamard _ lipschitz ill - posed _ for @xmath83 . at the critical value @xmath84",
    "the problem is globally well - posed for suitably small initial data ( and source term ) , but is ill - posed for sufficiently large initial data . in terms of the non - dimensional parameters introduced above in ,",
    "this dichotomy can be seen as global well - posedness for @xmath85 , and lipschitz ill - posedness for @xmath86 .",
    "a further feature of interest is that the anisotropy of the symbol can be explored to obtain an improvement in the regularity of the solutions when the initial data and source are _ supported on a plane in fourier space_. for such well - prepared data the local existence and uniqueness of solutions can be obtained for all values @xmath80 , and the global existence holds for all initial data when @xmath87 .",
    "we note that some of the theorems discussed in this article are valid for certain classes of partial differential equations cf .  ",
    "below , and in any spatial dimension @xmath88 . for such theorems ,",
    "the three dimensional mg equation is a particular example of an active scalar equation for which these results hold .",
    "we conclude the manuscript with section  [ sec : concl ] , in which we present a few remaining open problems regarding the mathematical analysis of the mg equations .",
    "in this section we discuss the global regularity of solutions to  and the lyapunov stability of steady states , in the case that @xmath69 .      in order to show that there is no finite time loss of regularity of solutions to  with @xmath69 let us first perform a rough derivative count .",
    "the dissipation is smoothing by two derivatives , while the nonlinearity is also losing two derivatives : the first coming from @xmath89 , while the second one derivative loss is coming from the constitutive law @xmath90 $ ] , in view of . in this sense",
    "we may call the problem `` critical '' ( we make this more precise below ) .",
    "since the operator @xmath37 relating @xmath38 and @xmath16 is an order one pseudo - differenential operator , one may view the mg equation as an example of a more general class of of active scalar equations : @xmath91 with @xmath92 a matrix of zero - order pseudo - differential operators , and we use the summation convention on repeated indices .",
    "we have dropped the smooth source term @xmath93 from since it is not an obstacle to the well - posedness theory , have re - scaled the time variable so that the diffusivity coefficient is @xmath63 instead of @xmath29 ( this is not an issue since we will construct global in time solutions ) , and the @xmath92 corresponding to are given by @xmath94 .",
    "we call this class of active scalar equation `` singular '' since the drift velocity is given in terms of the advected scalar by a constitutive law which is losing derivatives .",
    "we refer the interested reader in to the work of chae , constantin , cordoba , gancedo , and wu  @xcite and also  @xcite for further discussions about the well - posedness theory of singular active scalar equations .",
    "to make the idea of criticality more precise , we note that the active scalar equation  has a natural scaling invariance built into it : if @xmath95 is a solution , then @xmath96 is _ also _ a solution , with corresponding drift given by @xmath97 .",
    "hence @xmath98 is the critical lebesgue space with respect to the natural scaling of the equation .",
    "additionally is a scalar equation , so that @xmath99 norms are non - increasing in time for @xmath100 , and hence the @xmath101 norm is the `` strongest '' a priori controlled norm along solutions . in this sense",
    "we say that  is a `` critical '' equation .",
    "another active scalar equation derived from the navier - stokes equations for a rapidly rotating fluid in a thin shell is the surface quasi - geostrophic equation , introduced by constantin , majda , and tabak  @xcite ( see also  @xcite and references therein ) , which in the critically dissipative case reads @xmath102 and @xmath103 represents the @xmath104 riesz transform",
    ". there are strong analogies between the systems  and . the velocity field is divergence free in both cases , and the @xmath101 norm is critical with respect to the natural scaling of the equation .",
    "the main difference is that in for sqg the dissipative operator is non - local , but the drift velocity is not more singular than the advected scalar .    inspired by the de giorgi - type proof of global regularity for the critically dissipative sqg equation of cafarelli and vasseur  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for different proofs ) , to show that solutions of  do not blow up in finite time , we first look at the associated linear problem , where the drift velocity is _ given _ and obeys the bounds that are a priori available for weak solutions of the nonlinear problem : @xmath105 . in",

    "lastly , we pass to the limit @xmath466 and obtain a solution of  with desired properties .    if the initial data @xmath15 and the source term @xmath93 have fourier support in @xmath451 , we show that for @xmath467 the local in time solution may be continued for all time .",
    "[ thm : well - prepared : global ] let @xmath468 and @xmath93 be as in the statement of theorem  [ thm : well - prepared : local ] . if @xmath469 , the unique smooth solution @xmath16 of the cauchy problem  is global in time .",
    "the proof hinges on the observation that the solution constructed in theorem [ thm : well - prepared : local ] satisfies @xmath470 .",
    "then , in view of and the hrmander - mikhlin theorem we have @xmath471 for all @xmath472 , and so the velocity @xmath38 is as smooth as the scalar @xmath16 .",
    "hence , the case @xmath473 is `` sub - critical '' for the a priori controlled quantities , and energy estimates in the spirit of those used to prove the global regularity of the sub - critical sqg equation  @xcite , may be used to prove theorem [ thm : well - prepared : global ] .",
    "the case @xmath84 in theorem  [ thm : well - prepared : global ] is more subtle , and is analogous with the problem of global regularity for the critical sqg equation  @xcite . the anisotropic nature of the symbol @xmath37 , makes it more convenient to apply the de giorgi - inspired proof of @xcite in the context of the fractional mg equation with @xmath81 .",
    "the main ingredient is that if @xmath474 and @xmath475 , then @xmath476 .",
    "hence , considering first the linear problem with divergence - free @xmath141 drift we obtain hlder continuity of the solution .",
    "the later norm is sub - critical and one may bootstrap to higher regularity .",
    "we refer the interested reader to  @xcite for details .",
    "we have proven that the magneto - geostrophic model proposed by moffatt and loper is capable of sustaining dynamo action .",
    "the mg - dynamo instability exhibited here relies crucially on the fact that the dimensionless parameter @xmath24   is neither @xmath477 , nor @xmath440 .",
    "the exponential growth is of order @xmath478 , for all @xmath479 , and @xmath480 . in terms of the physics in the model ,",
    "this condition on @xmath24 requires that _ all three forces _ , coriolis , lorentz , and gravity , _ are non - zero _ , making the mg - instability somewhat different in nature from the usual rayleigh - taylor instability .    at the level of mathematical analysis several problems",
    "remain to be addressed , including some well / ill - posedness issues . for the non - diffusive equation ,",
    "_ is there a `` stronger '' form of ill - posedness such as norm inflation or even finite time blowup ? _ can we refine the well - posedness results for the fractionally diffusive problem in the range @xmath481 ?",
    "that is , _ can one establish the global existence of smooth solutions or on the contrary , prove finite time blowup ? _    several , interesting , mathematical issues arise when returning to the derivation of the mg equation from the full three dimensional mhd equations in the spirit of  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we note that moffatt s and loper s initial discussion includes the kinematic viscosity @xmath19 , which is directly proportional to @xmath27 in .",
    "the values of @xmath27 and @xmath29 are highly conjectural , but both are believed to be _ extremely _ small .",
    "therefore , as _ opposed _ to the mg system , if we keep @xmath482 we derive from  the system @xmath483 the presence of the laplacian term in makes the constitutive law relating @xmath38 and @xmath16 `` better '' , in the sense that the @xmath37 operator corresponding to  , now depends both on @xmath56 and @xmath27 , and is in fact smoothing of degree @xmath484 ( see equations ( 29)(30 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "hence , in this case the constitutive law is even better than that for the two - dimensional euler equation in vorticity form , implying that : _ in the range @xmath482 , the system  is globally well - posed , even if @xmath485_.    this observation is interesting in view of the much more challenging problem of _ establishing properties of the solutions to  in the vanishing parameters limits @xmath486 and @xmath271 _ , as proposed by moffatt and loper . the later question is directly related to the turbulent scaling regime for @xmath16 conjectured by moffatt in  @xcite",
    ". `` turbulence '' in the framework of vanishing diffusivity @xmath29 for the forced system  , and the presence of anomalous dissipation of energy for @xmath16 , or `` thetargy '' , may be plausible for very weak solutions ( below onsager critical ) of the non - diffusive equation .",
