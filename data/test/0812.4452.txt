    "until a few years ago there was a common feeling in the condensed matter physics community that we had a very good understanding of the universal properties of one - dimensional systems of fermions through our knowledge of luttinger liquid theory and its instabilities @xcite .",
    "one of the key results of luttinger liquid theory @xcite is that interacting electrons in one - dimension have separate dynamics in the spin and charge sectors at low energies .",
    "these low energy collective spin and charge modes are bosonic and generally propagate with different velocities , with the spin mode typically being the slower of the two .",
    "luttinger liquid theory provides a particularly convenient theoretical framework for discussing the response of the electron gas to a time - dependent local potential , even in higher dimensions : the mathematical trick of  bosonization \" makes the evaluation of correlation functions relatively simple , and a potential local on the scale of the fermi wavelength results in scattering of primarily @xmath3-wave type which effectively converts the problem to just one dimension ( the radial coordinate ) .",
    "a few years back it was realized that at finite temperatures a  luttinger liquid system \" can take on qualitatively new behaviors in transport @xcite and the single - particle green s function @xcite .",
    "some of the results for the single - particle green s function were anticipated in an earlier work @xcite , but the many novel features that can arise due to finite temperatures were not fully appreciated until the more recent works mentioned above which really started proper the study of the spin - incoherent luttinger liquid @xcite .    the spin - incoherent regime of a one - dimensional interacting electron gas is defined in the following way .",
    "let us assume that at zero temperature our system is spin - charge separated with spin velocity @xmath4 and charge velocity @xmath5 such that @xmath6 .",
    "if the interactions are strong ( regardless of the range of interactions ) it can be shown that @xmath4 can be _ exponentially small _ compared to @xmath5 @xcite . defining a characteristic spin energy @xmath7 and a characteristic charge energy @xmath8 for mean particle spacing @xmath9 ,",
    "it is evidently clear that the spin energy can be exponentially suppressed relative to the charge energy : @xmath10 .",
    "an exponentially separated spin and charge energy makes it possible for the thermal energy to lie in the range @xmath11 where @xmath12 is boltzman s constant and @xmath13 is the temperature .",
    "a one dimensional electron system in the energy window @xmath11 is said to be in the spin - incoherent regime .",
    "if the charge sector is gapless it will be described by a zero - temperature luttinger liquid theory and the resulting system is called a spin - incoherent luttinger liquid ( sill ) .",
    "note that if @xmath14 refers to a spin _ gap _ then a sill is still realized when @xmath11 provided the charge sector remains gapless .",
    "for a general discussion of the sill see @xcite . for sill physics in ferromagnetic and",
    "superconducting hybrid structures see @xcite , and in cold atomic gases see @xcite .",
    "in this article we will only discuss a particularly simple form of a time - dependent spatially local potential whereby its value is changed instantaneously from zero to non - zero .",
    "the prototypical physical realization of this situation is when a photon in the x - ray energy range ejects a deep  core \" electron from a metal  instantly changing the local charge by @xmath15 .",
    "the electrons of the metal then rush in to screen the positive potential and thereby change their states .",
    "if the electrons interact strongly with each other the processes of the electrons  rushing in \" to screen the local potential will obviously be impacted . according to luttinger liquid theory , interactions qualitatively change the nature of the low energy physics in such a way that",
    "electron - like quasi - particles are absent from the theory @xcite leaving only the collective bosonic excitations . on this basis alone , we expect the response of one - dimensional systems to differ in some ways from their higher dimensional counter parts . in fact , this expectation is correct but to fully appreciate the differences , it is important to review some of basic ideas and qualitative expectations for the singular responses of non - interacting electron systems .",
    "the seminal theoretical ideas of the singular response of a non - interacting electron gas due to a localized core hole were worked out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a nice textbook - level discussion can be found in @xcite and a more recent review in @xcite .",
    "the most important results to emerge are : ( i ) there is a threshold frequency @xmath1 above which there is photon absorption and below which there is not .",
    "( ii ) the photon absorption at frequencies just above @xmath1 follows a power law with exponent @xmath2 .",
    "the photon absorption intensity is computed from a fermi s golden rule - type treatment in the electron - photon coupling and from the results just cited above takes the form @xmath16 near threshold where @xmath17 is a constant , and @xmath18 for @xmath19 while @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "a schematic of the possible behaviors is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic_threshold ] .     schematic behavior of photon absorption intensity , eq.([eq : i_fl ] ) , for an infinite mass core hole in three dimensions .",
    "the exponent @xmath2 given by eq.([eq : a ] ) contains positive contributions from excitonic effects and negative contributions from anderson s orthogonality catastrophe .",
    "it is possible for @xmath2 to be either positive ( a ) or negative ( b ) . in the spin - incoherent regime of one dimensional systems",
    "the absorption is not generally given by eq.([eq : i_fl ] ) but instead exhibits logarithmic corrections and additional physics enters the exponent @xmath2 . ]    the important microscopic details of the electron dynamics and the electron - core hole interaction are encoded in the exponent @xmath2 and the power - law form itself .",
    "the power - law arises from summing an infinite series of diagrams containing logarithmic divergences @xcite .",
    "as we will see , in the sill the power law form is not sacred .",
    "it will be modified by logarithmic corrections , and the physics encoded in @xmath2 will depend on whether or not the one - dimensional system is in the spin - incoherent regime . for a non - interacting electron gas",
    "the exponent takes the form @xcite",
    "@xmath22 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the phase shift induced by the core hole in the @xmath24 channel of the conduction electrons .",
    "often @xmath3-wave scattering ( @xmath25 ) is the dominant channel and we will assume this is the case throughout this review . as the total amount of screening charge around the core hole must be one unit of charge , there is a friedel sum rule : @xmath26 if the scattering is not too strong , the phase shifts @xmath23 can be computed in the born approximation and one finds @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the density of states at the fermi energy and @xmath29 is the strength of the electron - hole interaction assumed momentum and energy independent .",
    "( the actual core hole - electron interaction is @xmath30 and therefore attractive . ) within the born approximation and assuming only @xmath3-wave scattering , the exponent becomes @xmath31 ^ 2.\\ ] ] evidently , eq.([eq : a ] ) and eq.([eq : a_approx ] ) imply there are competing effects in @xmath2 .",
    "the first term proportional to @xmath32 is positive while the second term proportional to @xmath33 ^ 2 $ ] is negative .",
    "going back to eq.([eq : i_fl ] ) one sees that a positive contribution to @xmath2 tends to make the threshold response more singular , while a negative contribution to @xmath2 tends to make the threshold response less singular .",
    "in fact , the origin of these two contributions are very well understood .",
    "the first contribution to @xmath2 in eq.([eq : a ] ) comes from excitonic effects arising from the attractive interaction between the electrons and the core hole .",
    "the second contribution to @xmath2 in eq.([eq : a ] ) arises from anderson s orthogonality catastrophe @xcite and it tends to suppress the absorption by the small ( vanishing as @xmath34 ) overlap between initial and final states .",
    "note that for a non - interacting fermi sea both excitonic effects and orthogonality effects disappear if @xmath35 and the absorption threshold becomes a simple step .",
    "looking ahead for a moment to luttinger liquid physics , it is instructive to point out that if a collection of fermions is interacting , there will be orthogonality effects if an additional fermion of like charge is added to the system because the other fermions must adjust their state to accommodate the newcomer , but no excitonic effects .",
    "this rearrangement of electronic states is what is responsible for the famous power law suppression of the tunneling density of states in a luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth emphasizing that depending on the microscopic details involved , it is possible for @xmath2 to be positive or negative as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic_threshold ] . if the mass of the core hole is finite and one considers only direct transitions like those in fig .",
    "[ fig : direct_transition ] one finds that the threshold is smeared out and disappears @xcite .",

    "@xmath36 denotes the fermi energy . in ( a ) an electron",
    "is excited from a valence band up to a conduction band leaving behind a single mobile hole in the valence band . in",
    "( b ) an electron is excited from an infinite mass core level .",
    "the photo - absorption of both process ( a ) and ( b ) differ in one dimension compared to their counterparts in three dimensions .",
    "furthermore , the response in one dimension depends on whether the system is in the luttinger liquid or spin - incoherent luttinger liquid regime . ]",
    "before we turn our attention to the spin - incoherent luttinger liquid , it is useful for orientation to discuss the singular response of its closest cousin , the luttinger liquid .",
    "the behavior exhibited by the one - dimensional luttinger liquid ( ll ) will already take us part of the way to understanding the response of the sill . in all of the results quoted below finite system size effects",
    "will not become important until frequencies smaller than @xmath37 are probed , where @xmath38 is the length of the system and @xmath39 is the fermi velocity .",
    "also , finite temperature will cut - off the singular behaviors when relevant frequencies are of order @xmath40 and smaller . in this sense , finite system size and temperature",
    "can act as a non - zero threshold for tunneling into a finite length system or an infinite system at finite temperature , for example .",
    "let us first consider the simplest kind of singular response : abruptly adding a particle to a ll as occurs during tunneling . a nice pedagogical discussion of the essential physics of tunneling into a ll is given by @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the central elements of their discussion .",
    "the tunneling process is conveniently visualized within a wigner crystal - type picture for spinless electrons , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wigner_schematic ] .",
    "schematic of the tunneling process of spinless electrons into a  wigner crystal \" type electron arrangement .",
    "electrons are schematically represented by black dots evenly spaced on either side of the tunneling barrier of strength @xmath41 at @xmath42 .",
    "the tunneling occurs in two steps : a fast process where the electron enters the region @xmath21 from the left followed by a slow process of charge relaxation where each electron shifts over to the right by a distance of one lattice constant . at long times",
    "@xmath43 as discussed in the text .",
    "the resulting behavior of the tunneling density of states is @xmath44 the qualitative behavior of the tunneling density of states looks very much like that in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic_threshold](b ) with @xmath45 . ]",
    "such a picture implies very strong electron interactions , but the physical result and the final mathematical expression that describes it are actually valid at any interaction strength .",
    "we imagine a process where an electron tunnels from the left of the barrier at @xmath42 to the right of the barrier at time @xmath46 . the rate at which the electron tunnels is determined by the debye frequency of the wigner crystal , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the fermi wave vector and @xmath49 is the phonon ( charge ) velocity .",
    "when an electron tunnels the potential near the barrier suddenly ( on a time scale @xmath50 ) changes .",
    "the energy cost of this new configuration is large , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the interaction parameter for the spinless luttinger liquid .",
    "( here @xmath53 if the electrons are non - interacting . )",
    "this large energy cost is reduced by the relatively slow process of the electrons relaxing to new equilibrium positions in order to minimize the energy . once the relaxation process is complete , all the electrons",
    "will be shifted to the right by one crystalline period . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "this new wavefunction is orthogonal to the original one which implies at zero energy ( @xmath54 ) there is no tunneling .",
    "this is a concrete example of anderson s orthogonality catastrophe that we earlier mentioned plays a role in the exponent @xmath2 of the threshold behavior of photon absorption . for finite energy",
    "the final state may be in an excited state so the relaxation is not complete and the initial and final wavefunction can have finite overlap .",
    "we will now see how this directly leads to a power law tunneling density of states , one of the  singular \" responses of interest in this article .",
    "we can compute the tunneling density of states from the single particle green s function @xcite . in the semi - classical approximation",
    "the electron tunneling takes the path of minimal action which is given by the classical trajectory @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the electron annihilation operator at position @xmath57 and time @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the creation operator .",
    "the initial density deformation @xmath60 will eventually relax to @xmath61 .",
    "as the processes is classically forbidden , the trajectory runs in imaginary time @xmath62 .",
    "the classical equation of motions for a harmonic lattice give @xmath63 the potential energy of the deformation is @xmath64 ^ 2},\\ ] ] which gives @xmath65 . by the virial theorem ,",
    "the kinetic energy is equal to the potential energy . therefore the action describing the slow part of the tunneling is @xmath66 whence @xmath67 . taking the fourier",
    "transform one finds the tunneling density of states @xmath68 . since we have assumed @xmath69 , the tunneling density of states @xmath70 as @xmath34 , as we noted above in the context of the orthogonality catastrophe .",
    "the discussion above illustrates some of the most central aspects of singular responses of interacting one - dimensional systems .",
    "however , there is much more to the story .",
    "let us now suppose that instead of an electron tunneling , we consider an incident photon that abruptly creates a particle - hole pair as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : direct_transition ] . note that due to the presence of the gap between the hole states and conduction band , there will be a minimum frequency @xmath1 required to create the particle - hole pair .",
    "if we first focus on the electrons in the conduction band , we see that the process is similar to tunneling : conduction band electrons see the sudden appearance of a new electron and they must adjust their positions by relaxing to a new state just as if the electron tunneled from outside the system . as we have seen , this relaxation rate is related to the strength of the electron interactions @xmath71 in the luttinger liquid , and based on the power law density of states we obtained , we expect the threshold behavior will also contain at least a power law contribution with an exponent that contains information about the interactions in the system .",
    "it is also important to consider the interaction between the hole created and the electrons in the conduction band . as holes and electrons",
    "generally have different masses and they attract rather than repel each other , the creation of a hole adds new physics to the electron tunneling physics above .",
    "in fact , to compute the photon absorption spectrum near threshold we must _ simultaneously _ account for the interaction of the electrons with each other and with the hole . in general",
    ", this is a very difficult problem .",
    "fortunately , though , the power of luttinger liquid theory and the commonly used technical methods such as bosonization allow us to make some precise and quite general statements about @xmath72 .",
    "pioneering theoretical work in the study of the fermi - edge singularity in luttinger liquids was carried out more than 15 years ago @xcite , and later works soon followed @xcite .",
    "a recent review of the optical response of low dimensional systems ( including some aspects of one - dimension ) exists @xcite , so here we will only highlight the main issues and results to set the stage for our discussion of the spin - incoherent one - dimensional systems .    in one - dimensional electronic systems",
    "the effect of impurities is especially dramatic compared to three dimensions .",
    "even for an unrealistic non - interacting one - dimensional system the electrons localize leading to insulating behavior . however , for a realistic system which contains repulsive interactions even a single local potential of arbitrary strength will localize the electrons to the half - line @xcite .",
    "the central physics of this result is the relevance of electron backscattering as a perturbation : at low energies the strength of the impurity grows to arbitrarily large values and eventually divides the system into two semi - infinite segments .",
    "this physics is important for the fermi - edge singularity involving an infinitely massive core hole , _ i.e. _ one that is localized in space .    on the other hand , when the mass of the core hole is finite the physics is very different .",
    "the properties of a heavy particle ( holes are typically heavier than electrons ) moving in a luttinger liquid have been investigated @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the mobility of the heavy particle diverges at low energies , implying that electron backscattering from it becomes irrelevant .",
    "we therefore see that the fermi - edge singularity in a luttinger liquid falls into two categories : ( i ) infinite hole mass and ( ii ) finite hole mass .",
    "note that in three dimensions it was also important to divide the physics into the same two categories , but the reason for that division was different . in three dimensions finite",
    "hole mass led to excitonic effects that smeared the edge singularity of the direct transition and eliminated the threshold .",
    "this has to do with a large ( compared to one - dimension ) phase space for recoil effects .",
    "a sharp threshold only exists for the infinitely massive hole . on the other hand , in one dimension",
    "the issue is about the relevance / irrelevance of backscattering and that is decided by the interactions ( repulsive or attractive ) in the ll .",
    "another way to see that it is natural to divide the classes into infinite and finite masses cases is that the symmetry is different .",
    "an infinitely massive hole breaks the translational symmetry of the problem , while a hole with finite mass does not .",
    "one of the first issues addressed regarding the fermi - edge singularity in the ll is whether the threshold still exists for the case of finite hole mass .",
    "this was answered in the affirmative @xcite .",
    "the next logical question is how does the threshold exponent @xmath2 depend on the electron - hole and electron - electron interactions ?",
    "initially it was argued that @xmath2 was independent of the hole mass @xcite , but this was later challenged and corrected @xcite . knowing that any finite mass hole is an irrelevant perturbation @xcite we",
    "can immediately see that only forward scattering interactions will contribute to @xmath2 .",
    "indeed this is found as well as a schematic phase diagram for when @xmath2 is positive or negative @xcite .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath73,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is an asymmetric phase shift and @xmath75 a symmetric phase shift defined below in the discussion of the spin - incoherent case .",
    "the presence of @xmath74 implies that the exponent depends on the mass of the hole .",
    "note that both @xmath74 and @xmath75 correspond to forward scattering processes , and @xmath69 is the luttinger parameter for repulsively interacting spinless electrons .",
    "we can directly compare the result eq.([eq : a_ll_mobile ] ) with the non - interacting case eq.([eq : a ] ) by taking @xmath53 and @xmath76 ( appropriate for an infinitely massive hole ) .",
    "doing so , we note the form is identical to an s - wave only scattering model . from this comparison",
    "we also see that @xmath75 has the meaning of a phase shift up to factors of 2 and @xmath77 .",
    "note that we are allowed to compare the result for a mobile impurity in a ll with an infinitely massive impurity in a free electron gas in three dimensions because in the latter backscattering is not a relevant perturbation .",
    "they are therefore in a similar  class \" .",
    "the situation is different when we turn to immobile infinite mass holes . here , as before , a threshold exists , but now @xmath2 is modified by the relevant backscattering and in fact obtains a universal contribution of 1/8 @xcite , @xmath78 in the next section we will discuss how these two results are modified in the spin - incoherent regime .",
    "but before we do that , it is important to comment on the experimental situation .",
    "unfortunately , there are few published results @xcite and the overall level of agreement between theory and experiment is poor . clearly there is great need for further experiments on fermi - edge singularities on clean , single mode one - dimensional systems .",
    "we hope this article will help to stimulate more .",
    "we finally come to the main topic of this review well prepared from the earlier discussions of singular responses of non - interacting electron gases and luttinger liquids .",
    "the question to ask is what are the similarities and differences between the singular responses of a sill and a ll or fermi liquid ? as we will see , the behavior is qualitatively different from both the ll and fermi liquid making it possible to distinguish them in experiment .",
    "perhaps the simplest and most striking difference is the behavior of the tunneling density of states .",
    "we begin there .",
    "the first theoretical study of tunneling into a sill was reported in the infinite @xmath79 limit of the hubbard model in a lengthy bethe ansatz calculation @xcite . immediately afterwards a simpler and more general method based on bosonization and the imaginary time path integral representation",
    "was given @xcite .",
    "extensions of the method to finite length systems including boundary effects and externally applied magnetic fields have also been reported @xcite .",
    "while the imaginary time path integral formulation is well suited to the regime of the sill , it does not provide a conceptually straightforward generalization to the regime @xmath80 . in order to address that regime , we need a representation of the spin degrees of freedom that are valid at arbitrary energy scales .",
    "such a formulation is now in hand @xcite and it provides a good starting point for numerical studies in the regime @xmath80 .      as is typical of interacting one dimensional electron systems",
    ", we assume the hamiltonian in the strongly interacting case is spin - charge separated @xcite , @xmath81 . here , @xmath82 is identical to that of the ll , and is given by @xcite @xmath83 , \\label{eq : h_holon}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are bosonic fields satisfying @xmath86=-i\\frac{\\pi}{2 } { \\rm sgn}(x - x')$ ] , and @xmath87 is the effective luttinger interaction parameter of the electron gas @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the spin hamiltonian at arbitrary temperatures is to a very good approximation given by a nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin chain @xcite , @xmath88 where evidently the spin energy is set by @xmath89 : @xmath90 .",
    "the basic idea is to represent the electron operator as a product of operators that describe the holons @xmath91 [ spinless fermions that naturally arise in the context of strongly interacting fermions and the spin - incoherent regime @xcite ] and the spin degrees of freedom @xmath92 .",
    "the holon operators ( denoted by @xmath93 ) by construction satisfy the equation @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the electron annihilation operator for electrons of spin projection @xmath96 , and @xmath97 the corresponding electron creation operator .",
    "the issue of how to bosonize the electron operator for a strongly interacting system earlier arose in the context of the large @xmath79 limit of the one - dimensional hubbard model where @xcite wrote the electron creation operator as @xmath98 where @xmath99 creates a site on the spin chain eq.([eq : s_chain ] ) with spin projection @xmath96 .",
    "the expression in eq.([eq : penc_bos ] ) can be physically motivated as follows . from eq.([eq : psi ] ) it is clear that the creation of an electron is also accompanied by the creation of a holon .",
    "however , electrons also carry spin so there must be a component of the electron operator that also creates spin .",
    "this is accomplished by @xmath99 . in general",
    ", one has @xmath100 as the object that adds a new site to the spin chain between @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "while this appears physically intuitive , the expression suffers from the drawback that it does not naturally account for the variation of electron density with position in a real electron gas @xcite .",
    "the remedy for this issue @xcite is to define the position at which the spin site is added to the chain eq.([eq : s_chain ] ) in terms of the number of holons to the left of the site , @xmath103 in terms of eq.([eq : l_x ] ) the electron creation and annihilation operators are defined as @xmath104 the operators given above explicitly account for the fact that the spins are attached to electrons , and the formulas are valid at all energy scales .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that even though the hamiltonian is spin - charge separated , the electron operators are not written as a product of a spin piece and a charge piece because the  spin \" pieces @xmath105 also depend on the electron density via eq.([eq : l_x ] ) .    in writing eq.([eq : psi+_x ] ) and eq.([eq : psi_x ] ) no assumptions have been made about the energy scale relative to the spin and charge energies .",
    "we now restrict our considerations to energies small compared to @xmath106 , but arbitrary with respect to @xmath14 . in this case",

    "it is instructive to compare the similarities and differences of the fermi - edge singularity with a mobile hole in the ll and sill . comparing with the general formula eq.([eq : i_fl ] )",
    "we see that the threshold behavior is different in the sill compared to the ll and even the fermi liquid .",
    "the threshold behavior of the sill contains the same logarithmic corrections that we found earlier in the tunneling density of states .",
    "focusing on the power - law part of the threshold behavior we see that @xmath211 so that it is independent of @xmath74 , unlike the ll case in eq.([eq : a_ll_mobile ] ) .",
    "since the asymmetric phase shift does not appear , this implies the threshold exponent is _ independent of the hole dynamics and therefore the mass of the hole _ in the spin - incoherent case . of course , from eq.([eq : i_mobile_final ] ) it is clear that the effects of @xmath74 are still felt , but only as a prefactor to the frequency dependence .",
    "the effects of an externally applied magnetic field can also be easily incorporated @xcite . for a quantum wire",
    "the magnetic field does not affect the orbital part of the wavefunction until the magnetic length is of the order of the wire width .",
    "we therefore only discuss the coupling of the magnetic field to the spin of the electron , _",
    "i.e. _ a zeeman coupling . the magnetic field will influence the spin correlations described by @xmath137 . in the spin - incoherent regime with zero field",
    "one has @xmath212 , independent of @xmath96 . in a finite external field one instead has @xmath213 where @xmath214 and @xmath215 is the zeeman energy @xcite . while the presence of the magnetic field may shift the threshold energy",
    ", it will not affect the exponent eq.([eq : a_sill_mobile ] ) @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field also gives rise to a frequency scale @xmath216 below which sill behavior is observed and above which behavior characteristic of a spinless ll is observed @xcite , namely the form eq.([eq : i_fl ] ) with the exponent eq.([eq : a_ll_mobile ] ) .",
    "we next turn to the case of an infinitely massive impurity for which backscattering is irrelevant . in this case",
    "the effective electron - hole interaction is given by eq.([eq : e - h ] ) only with @xmath76 as this corresponds to the case of a stationary hole with no backscattering .",
    "the photon absorption in this case is thus given by eq.([eq : i_mobile_final ] ) with @xmath76 .",
    "while an infinite mass hole breaks translational symmetry , the irrelevance of backscattering effectively restores translational symmetry at low energies and the threshold behavior maps onto the finite mass case .    on the other hand , when backscattering is relevant the situation is very different . at low energies the hole acts as a boundary to a semi - infinite one dimensional system @xcite . in this case , the sill maps onto a _ spinless _ electron system @xcite which allows us to immediately exploit @xcite the results obtained for that system .",
    "in particular , one obtains a universal contribution of 1/8 to the threshold exponent @xcite , @xmath217 and the frequency dependence follows eq.([eq : i_fl ] ) _ without _ the logarithmic corrections .",
    "in fact , for the infinitely massive hole with relevant backscattering the only signature of spin - incoherent physics is hidden in the mapping @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "while our theoretical understanding of the spin - incoherent regime has advanced rapidly , the difficulty of obtaining the regime @xmath10 has hampered experimental tests of the theory . to date our best experimental evidence comes from momentum resolved tunneling on cleaved - edge overgrowth quantum wires @xcite , transport in split - gate devices @xcite , and somewhat more speculatively in transport measurements on gated single wall carbon nanotubes with low electron density @xcite .",
    "given that the existing theory now encompasses hybrid structures of sills with ferromagnets and superconductors as well @xcite , the number of experimental groups poised to make contributions to this exciting field is greatly enlarged .",
    "for a recent discussion of numerous possible experiments that would provide strong evidence for spin - incoherent luttinger liquid behavior see @xcite .    on the theoretical side , a number of open issues remain . in particular , it is desirable to have a better understanding of the behavior on temperature scales @xmath218 which is most likely very relevant for many experiments that approach but do not quite reach the spin - incoherent regime",
    ". related to this is the need for a better understanding of the crossover between the luttinger liquid and the spin - incoherent luttinger liquid regimes .",
    "both of these issues will likely require a numerical attack as there are no obvious analytical methods available to address them .",
    "finally there is the issue of spin - orbit coupling that has so far received no attention . for very strong spin - orbit coupling is there novel behavior in the regime @xmath219 ?",
