    "fano - anderson effect is an interesting phenomenon exhibited by excitonic states in a tight binding lattice when a discrete , bound state ` interacts ' with a continuum  @xcite .",
    "the effect is explicitly seen when one considers transmission spectrum of one dimensional quantum wire ( qw ) systems with a single quantum dot ( qd ) , or a cluster of them is attached to the qw from one side  @xcite .",
    "needless to say , the studies so far has gone well beyond mere theoretical interest , thanks to the present advanced stage of lithographic techniques and nanotechnology , and has incorporated the studies of nonequilibrium dynamics in optical transition  @xcite , quantum simulation  @xcite and tunneling in a kondo hole system  @xcite to name a few .",
    "inspite of the considerable volume of work existing in this field , a practically unaddressed issue , to the best of our knowledge , is how seriously does the presence of _ bound states _ caused by the attachment ( from one side ) of a qd or an assembly of them , influence a singular continuous spectrum .",
    "a singular continuous spectrum is the hallmark of what are known as quasiperiodic systems  @xcite such as the fibonacci class of substitutionally generated atomic chains or , the array of harper potentials ( aubry - andre chains ) . due to the fragmented , cantor like character of the energy spectra offered by these systems , the bound states can , in principle , occupy any local gap inside the spectrum and may de - stabilize the fundamental character of the entire energy spectrum . a central motivation of the present work is to look into such an issue .",
    "we intend to work with a golden mean fibonacci chain where finite arrays of qds are side - grafted to every atomic site , giving the lattice an aperiodic comb structure .",
    "the model has particular relevance in the context of recent studies on spectral properties of excitons in nanoparticle array  @xcite .",
    "the comb - structure enables us to examine the interference of fano lineshapes and the effect of the side coupled dots on the energy spectrum and transport properties of such a system .",
    "the presence of multiple , closely spaced gaps and a multifractal spectrum , when coupled to discrete , bound states from one side , offers a possibility of controlling the gaps , and may be even the basic character of the electronic states . in the present day of nanotechnology and revolution in fabricating tailor",
    "made lattices this can even open up the possibility of designing novel qd devices .",
    "these aspects prompt us to undertake the present study .",
    "we find extremely interesting results .",
    "with a golden mean fibonacci chain having side coupled qd arrays , the presence of an infinite number of grafted chains enables one to control the transmission properties at all scales of energy by suitably changing the number of atoms in the side coupled array .",
    "the most important result is that , under certain special conditions the entire energy spectrum of the infinite system turns out to have absolutely continuous subbands of energy .",
    "the occurrence of these continuous subbands is triggered by a certain special relationship between the off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian .",
    "surprisingly , this is something that is not expected in any conventional localization scheme , such as the anderson localization  @xcite , where the single particle states get localized in a disordered array of potentials irrespective of the numerical values of the parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "our results therefore present a strong case of a violation of this _ universality _ of anderson localization .",
    "the system to be described by a tight - binding hamiltonian , is depicted in fig .",
    "[ system ] .",
    "we have used real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) decimation scheme  @xcite and green s function technique to analyze the energy spectrum and the nature of eigenstates of the system .",
    "the side - attached qd arrays play a crucial role in generating and controlling the number of continuous energy bands .",
    "extended character of the electron states populated in the bands are reflected in a prominent enhancement of two - terminal quantum transport through the system .    in what follows",
    ", we describe the results obtained by us . in section  [ sec2 ] we present our model and the mathematical methods used for handling the problem .",
