    "a fundamental purpose of molecular simulation is the computation of macroscopic quantities , typically through averages of functions of the variables of the system with respect to a given probability measure  @xmath0 , which defines the macroscopic state of the system . in the most common",
    "setting , the probability measure  @xmath0 with respect to which averages are computed corresponds to the canonical ensemble ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "its distribution is defined by the boltzmann - gibbs density , which models the configurations of a conservative system in contact with a heat bath at fixed temperature .",
    "numerically , high - dimensional averages with respect to  @xmath0 are often approximated as ergodic averages over realizations of appropriate stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) : @xmath1 a typical dynamics to this end is the langevin dynamics @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a standard wiener process , @xmath4 the potential energy function , @xmath5 a friction coefficient , @xmath6 the mass matrix of the system , and @xmath7 is proportional to the inverse temperature ( see section  [ section modified langevin dynamics ] for more precise definitions ) . for references on the ergodicity of langevin dynamics",
    ", we refer the reader to  @xcite and @xcite , for instance .",
    "there are two main sources of error in the computation of average properties such as @xmath8 through time averages as in  : ( i ) a systematic bias ( or _ perfect sampling bias _ ) related to the use of a discretization method for the sdes ( and usually proportional to a power of the integration step size @xmath9 ) , and ( ii ) statistical errors , due to the finite lengths of the sampling paths involved and the underlying variance of the random variables .",
    "the first point was studied in  @xcite for standard langevin dynamics .",
    "our focus in this work is on the statistical error .",
    "statistical errors may be large when the dynamics is metastable , _",
    "i.e. _ when the system remains trapped for a very long time in some region of the configuration space ( called a metastable region ) before hopping to another metastable region .",
    "metastability implies that the convergence of averages over trajectories is very slow , and that transitions between metastable regions ( which are typically the events of interest at the macroscopic level ) are very rare .",
    "in fact , metastability arises from the multi - modality of the probability measure sampled by the dynamics .",
    "we refer for instance to  @xcite for a review on ways to quantify the metastability of sampling dynamics .",
    "there are various strategies to reduce the variance of time averages by reducing the metastability .",
    "the most famous one is importance sampling : the potential energy function  @xmath4 is modified by an additional term  @xmath10 so that the langevin dynamics associated with @xmath11 is less metastable . an automatic way of doing so is to consider a so - called reaction coordinate , and define @xmath10 as the opposite of the associated free energy ( see @xcite for further precisions ) .",
    "we explore here an alternative path , which consists in modifying the kinetic energy rather than the potential energy .",
    "indeed , recall that the difficult part in sampling the canonical measure is in sampling positions ( see section  [ section modified langevin dynamics ] for a more precise discussion of this point ) .",
    "there is therefore some freedom in the choice of the kinetic energy if the goal is to compute average properties .",
    "previous works in this direction focused on changing the mass matrix in order to increase the time steps used in the simulation ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . the mathematical analysis we provide",
    "is inspired by a recent work by  @xcite where the kinetic energy of each particle is more drastically modified : it is set to  0 when the particle s momenta are small , while it remains unchanged for larger momenta . in such _",
    "adaptively restrained _ ( ar ) simulations , particles may become temporarily _ frozen _ , while their momenta may continue to evolve . since , in many cases , inter - particle forces only depend on relative particle positions , and hence do not have to be updated when particles are frozen , adaptively restrained particle simulations may yield a significant algorithmic speed - up  @xmath12 when a sufficiently large number of particles are frozen at each time step ( or , more generally , when inter - particle distances remain constant and particle forces are expressed in local reference frames ) . this has been demonstrated in several contexts , _",
    "e.g. _ for modeling hydrocarbon systems ( @xcite ) , proteins ( @xcite ) , and for electronic structure calculations ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , freezing particles even temporarily may make iterates more correlated , which may translate into an increase of the statistical error  @xmath13 observed for modified langevin dynamics , compared to the statistical error  @xmath14 observed for standard langevin dynamics .",
    "the actual speed - up of the method , in terms of the total wall - clock time needed to achieve a given precision in the estimation of an observable , should therefore be expressed as : @xmath15 our aim here is thus to quantify the increase in the variance as a function of the parameters of the modified kinetic energy .",
    "in fact , a first task is to prove that the langevin dynamics with modified kinetic energy is indeed ergodic , and that the variance is well defined .",
    "this is unclear at first sight since the modified dynamics fails to be hypoelliptic ( see the discussion in section  [ sec : cv_ergo_avg ] ) .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section  [ section modified langevin dynamics ]",
    ", we introduce the modified langevin dynamics we consider , and present the particular case of the ar - langevin dynamic .",
    "the ergodicity of these dynamics is proved in section  [ section ergodicity ] , both in terms of almost - sure convergence of time averages along a single realization , and in terms of the law of the process .",
    "we also provide a result on the regularity of the evolution semi - group , adapted from similar estimates for standard langevin dynamics in  @xcite .",
    "such estimates allow us to analyze the statistical error in section  [ section analysis of statistical error ] .",
    "we state in particular a central limit theorem for  @xmath16 , and perform a perturbative study of the asymptotic variance of the ar - langevin dynamics in some limiting regime .",
    "our theoretical findings are illustrated by numerical simulations in section  [ sec : numerics ] , both in a simple one - dimensional case where the variance can be accurately computed using an appropriate galerkin approximation , as well as for a more realistic system for which we resort to monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the proofs of our results are gathered in section  [ section proofs ] .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath17 particles in spatial dimension  @xmath18 , so that the total dimension of the system is @xmath19 .",
    "the vectors of positions and momenta are denoted respectively by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used for positions , so that the phase - space of admissible configurations is @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the one - dimensional unit torus and @xmath25 the size of the simulation box .",
    "in order to possibly increase the rate of convergence of the ergodic averages  , we modify the langevin dynamics   by changing the kinetic energy . more precisely , instead of the standard quadratic kinetic energy @xmath26 we introduce a general kinetic energy function @xmath27 .",
    "the total energy of the system is then characterized by the hamiltonian @xmath28 in order to ensure that the measure @xmath29 can be normalized , and in order to simplify the mathematical analysis , we make in the sequel the following assumption .",
    "[ assumption potential ] the potential energy function @xmath4 belongs to @xmath30 , and @xmath31 grows sufficiently fast at infinity in order to ensure that @xmath32 .",
    "the langevin dynamics associated with a general hamiltonian reads @xmath33 where @xmath3 is a standard @xmath34-dimensional wiener process and @xmath35 is the friction constant . for the separable hamiltonian  , the general langevin dynamics simplifies as @xmath36 the generator of the process ( [ modified langevin ] ) reads @xmath37 a simple computation shows that the canonical distribution @xmath38 is invariant under the dynamics  , _",
    "i.e. _ for all @xmath39 functions @xmath40 with compact support , @xmath41    note that , in view of the separability of the hamiltonian , the marginal of the distribution @xmath0 in the position variables is , for any kinetic energy  @xmath42 , @xmath43 in particular , this marginal distribution therefore coincides with the one of the standard langevin dynamics  .",
    "this allows to straightforwardly estimate canonical averages of observables depending only on the positions with the modified langevin dynamics  .",
    "in fact , there is no restriction in generality in considering observables depending only on the positions , since general observables @xmath44 depending both on momenta and positions can be reduced to functions of the positions only by a partial integration in the momenta variables .",
    "this partial integration is often very easy to perform since momenta are independent gaussian random variables under the canonical measure associated with the standard kinetic energy .",
    "a concrete example for the choice of the kinetic energy function @xmath42 in ( [ eq : modified hamiltonian ] ) is the one proposed for the adaptively restrained langevin dynamics in  @xcite .",
    "it is parameterized by two constants @xmath45 . in this model ,",
    "the kinetic energy is a sum of individual contributions @xmath46 for large values of momenta , the modified individual kinetic energies are equal to the standard kinetic energy of one particle , but they vanish for small momenta : @xmath47 an appropriate function allows to smoothly interpolate between these two limiting regimes ( see definition  [ definition arps langevin ] for the precise expression ) .",
    "a possible choice of an individual kinetic energy  @xmath48 , as well as the associated canonical distribution of momenta @xmath49 are depicted in figure  [ figure 1 left ] and figure  [ figure 1 right ] when @xmath50 .",
    "( solid lines ) , and an example of an ar kinetic energy function  @xmath48 with parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( dashed line).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    .,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the interest of ar - langevin dynamics is that , when their individual kinetic energies are sufficiently small , particles do not move . when two particles are frozen in this way , their pairwise interactions need not be updated .",
    "this allows decreasing the computational complexity of the force computation , which is typically the most time - consuming part of a molecular dynamics solver .",
    "note that this can be generalized to higher - order interactions ( such as three - body interactions based on bending angles for instance ) .",
    "[ remark individual parameters ] note that , due to the additive structure of the kinetic energy , the momenta  @xmath53 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) under the canonical measure .",
    "it is however possible to choose different parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 for different particles , for example to focus calculations on a specific part of the particle system , in which case the momenta are still independent but not longer identically distributed .",
    "such a situation is considered in the numerical example presented in section  [ subsection a more realistic system : second order discretization ] .",
    "there are several notions of ergodicity for stochastic processes .",
    "we focus here on two of them : the convergence of ergodic averages over a single trajectory , and the convergence of the law of the process .",
    "the convergence of ergodic averages over one trajectory is automatically ensured by the existence of an invariant probability measure and the irreducibility of the dynamics ( see for instance  @xcite for early results on such convergences for possibly degenerate diffusions ) . since , by construction , an invariant probability measure is known ( namely the canonical measure  ) , it suffices to show that the process generated by the modified langevin equation is irreducible to conclude to the convergence of ergodic averages .    as reviewed in  @xcite , the most standard argument to prove the irreducibility of degenerate diffusions is to prove the controllability of the dynamics relying on the stroock - varadhan support theorem , and the regularity of the transition kernel thanks to some hypoellipticity property .",
    "these conditions are satisfied for standard langevin dynamics ( see for instance  @xcite ) , but not for the modified langevin dynamics we consider , since the hessian of the kinetic energy function may not be invertible on an open set .",
    "this is the case for the ar kinetic energy function presented in section  [ sec : arps_presentation ] .    to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us show for instance how the standard way of proving hypoellipticity fails ( the proof of the controllability faces similar issues ) .",
    "the first task is to rewrite the generator   of the process as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the adjoint of @xmath59 on the flat space @xmath60 .",
    "we next compute , for @xmath61 , the commutators @xmath62 = x_0x_j - x_j x_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}}\\,{\\nabla}\\left({\\partial}_{p_j } u\\right)\\cdot \\left({\\nabla}_q-\\gamma { \\nabla}_p\\right ) . \\ ] ] when @xmath63 is invertible , it is possible to recover the full algebra of derivatives by an appropriate combination of @xmath64 and @xmath65,\\dots,[x_0,x_d]$ ] . here , we consider a situation when this is not the case and , even more dramatically , where the hessian may vanish on an open set .",
    "in this situation , @xmath66=0 $ ] on the same open set , and in fact all iterated commutators @xmath67]$ ] also vanish .",
    "we solve this problem by a direct constructive approach , where we see the modified dynamics as a perturbation of the standard langevin dynamics .",
    "we rely on the following assumption :    the kinetic energy function @xmath68 of the modified langevin dynamics is such that @xmath69 for some constant @xmath70 .",
    "[ hyp mod langevin ergodicity ]    under this assumption , we can prove that the modified langevin dynamics is irreducible by proving an appropriate minorization condition , which crucially relies on the compactness of the position space  @xmath71 ( see section  [ proof of the minorization condition ] for the proof ) .",
