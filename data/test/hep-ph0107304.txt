    "nowadays intriguing theoretical extensions of the standard model are being explored , while the experimental results continue to confirm the validity of the model and constrain its extensions . given the limited energy range available at colliders , it is therefore vital to develop experimental probes that can climb up the energy ladder . a complementary way to analize these extensions while waiting for colliders of the next generations",
    "is provided by cosmic rays , which exceed the energy scales currently attainable .",
    "we have undertaken the preliminary steps in a program that aims to utilize cosmic rays as an experimental probe of theoretical generalizations of the standard model .",
    "we have in mind possible applications of cosmic rays for the study of supersymmetry .",
    "the first is in the context of top - down models of ultra ",
    "high  energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) , around and above the greisen  zatsepin ",
    "kuzmin cutoff . in these models",
    "the primary cosmic rays originate from the decay of a metastable superheavy particle which decay at rest , fragmenting into ordinary hadrons and photons .",
    "the dynamics of these decays can be modelled using standard qcd tools on which we elaborate below .",
    "we propose to analize supersymmetric effects in the decay of these metastable states using 2 scales :    * a high energy @xmath0 fragmentation scale @xmath1 ( decay of a metastable state @xmath2 primary protons ) * a collision scale @xmath3 due to the interaction of surviving primaries with air - nuclei ( @xmath4 tev )    at both scales supersymmetric scaling violations should be included and the multiplicities of the spectrum analized .",
    "as an illustration of the procedure we adopt in our studies , let s consider the decay of a hypothetical massive state of mass 1 tev into supersymmetric partons .",
    "the decay can proceed , for instance , through a regular @xmath5 channel and a shower is developed starting from the quark pair .",
    "the @xmath6 dglap equation describes in the leading logarithmic approximation the evolution of the shower which accompanies the pair , and we are interested in studying the impact of the supersymmetry breaking scale ( @xmath7 ) on the fragmentation . in our runs",
    "we have chosen the initial set of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we parameterize the fragmentation functions as @xmath8    typical fragmentation functions in qcd involve final states with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and kaons @xmath12 .",
    "we have chosen an initial evolution scale of @xmath13 gev and varied both the mass of the susy partners ( we assume for simplicity that these are all degenerate ) and the final evolution scale . in general",
    "the effects of supersymmetric evolution are small within the range described by the factorization scales @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 gev , @xmath17 gev ) .",
    "we mention that @xmath14 is the starting scale ( the highest scale ) at which the decay of the supersymmetric partons starts .",
    "@xmath15 is fixed by the gluino / squark masses and coincides with them .",
    "the situation appears to be completely different for the gluon fragmentation functions ( f.fs ) ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the regular and the sqcd evolved f.f.s differ largely in the diffractive region , and this clearly will show up in the spectrum of the primary protons if the decaying state has a supersymmetric content .",
    "as we raise the final evolution scale we start seeing more pronounced differences between regular and supersymmetric distributions .",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "2 the squark f.f.s for all the flavours and the one of the gluino for comparison . the scalar charm distribution appear to grow slightly faster then the remaining scalar ones .",
    "the gluino f.f .",
    "is still the fastest growing at small - x values .",
    "in a few years several experiments , including the pierre auger experiment @xcite , will start collecting data from cosmic rays .",
    "the issue of the origin of uhecr will be -hopefully- clarified . while the link of uhecr to agn s has been disfavored on the basis of a quite homogeneous distributions , the local origin of these events",
    "remains an open possibility .",
    "potential meta ",
    "stable superheavy string relics have been suggested as dark matter candidates , as well as potential sources for the uhecr @xcite .",
    "a qcd / sqcd analysis of these events is in progress . with the forthcoming experimental data @xcite , and",
    "improved theoretical analysis , along the lines discussed here , cosmic ray physics enters an exciting new era , with potentially ground  breaking discoveries .",
