    "catalogs of galaxy clusters with a large range of redshifts and cluster x - ray luminosities are an ideal basis for the test of cosmological parameters ( e.g. henry 2000  ; borgani et al .",
    "2001 ) and the study of cluster formation and evolution .",
    "the bright and southern serendipitous high redshift archival rosat cluster ( sharc ) surveys provide a sample of clusters detected in rosat observations over two decades of x - ray luminosities ( 10@xmath2 l@xmath3erg / s ) with redshifts between 0.2 and 0.8 ( romer et al . 2000  ; collins et al . 1997  ; burke et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we present here preliminary results based on the follow - up observations of three of these selected galaxy clusters with xmm ",
    "newton  : rx  j0256.5 + 0006 , rx  j2237.0 - 1516 and rx  j1200.8 - 0328 . for the first time",
    ", the new generation of x - ray observatory , like xmm - newton and _ chandra _ give capabilities to do precise spectroscopic and imaging analysis at the same time ( see e.g arnaud et al .",
    "2002a ) .",
    "our analysis is based on the three epic cameras , mos1&2 and pn . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use a cosmology with h@xmath4km / s / mpc , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the error bars are given with a confidence level of 90% .",
    "all the data presented here are treated with the version 5.2 of the sas ( science analysis software ) .",
    "we select event patterns and time intervals of low background as described in majerowicz et al .",
    "table 1 shows the effective exposure time of our observations after flare rejection .",
    "this suggests that this cluster does not host a strong cooling flow .",
    "this was already seen in rx  j1120.1 + 4318 , a relaxed cluster at z=0.6 ( arnaud et al .",
    "2002a ) also found in the sharc survey .",
    "the global temperature for this cluster is 5.1@xmath1kev .",
    "its surface brightness profile is fitted by a @xmath7-model and the parameters are  : @xmath7=0.64 and @xmath80.51@xmath9228kpc .",
