    "recently , several groups have reported their detections of relatively faint x - ray transients in the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations of the galactic center region @xcite .",
    "these authors conclude that these transients are collectively located near the galactic center , based on their absorbing columns and their sky distribution , although no direct distance measurements are available . with this assumption ,",
    "the inferred luminosities of these transients are in the 10@xmath010@xmath1 ergss@xmath2  range .",
    "the authors of these studies claim that such a luminosity is too high for cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , semi - detached binaries in which the accreting object is a white dwarf .",
    "instead , they argue for neutron star or black hole accretors based solely on the luminosity . however , the galactic center transients are sub - luminous compared to the known transient populations of black hole or neutron star binaries @xcite , requiring a new population ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the accretion driven x - ray luminosities of cvs are indeed insufficient to explain the galactic center transients .",
    "non - magnetic cv x - ray luminosities are in the range 10@xmath410@xmath5 ergss@xmath2 , with the highest value being 3@xmath6 ergss@xmath2  for the old nova , v603  aql @xcite .",
    "magnetic cvs , the intermediate polars ( ips ) in particular , are more luminous in 210 kev x - rays , with estimated luminosities often exceeding 10@xmath7 ergss@xmath2  @xcite . however , since the highest luminosity recorded for an ip is 1.3@xmath8 ergss@xmath2  during the outbursts of the unusual ip ( and another old nova ) , gk  per @xcite , ips are also not likely candidates for the galactic center x - ray transients .",
    "however , the above discussion is incomplete because it is limited to the accretion driven x - ray luminosities of cvs . in reality , cvs can generate higher x - ray luminosities through nuclear fusion , which is a more efficient source of energy than accretion onto a white dwarf . indeed , classical novae have been known to emit 210 kev x - rays at luminosities exceeding 10@xmath0 ergss@xmath2 .",
    "we present below a summary of x - ray properties of classical as well as recurrent novae .",
    "a white dwarf accreting at below the critical rate will undergo a thermonuclear runaway and becomes a classical nova , once a sufficient amount of fresh fuel has been accumulated ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "a classical nova releases enough energy ( @xmath9 ergs ) to eject a shell of up to @xmath10 m@xmath11 at a typical velocity of 1000 kms@xmath2 .",
    "classical novae are seen as spectacular optical transients that brighten by over 10 magnitudes , reaching peak brightness as high as m@xmath12 @xcite . by definition , a classical nova has only been observed to go into outburst once , although they are thought to repeat with a recurrence period of well over 1,000 years .",
    "a recurrent nova is a closely related system that has been seen to undergo multiple thermonuclear runaways ; theories of thermonuclear runaways require a high mass white dwarf accreting at a high rate to explain the short recurrence times of these objects .    imaging x - ray observations of classical novae weeks to months after visual peak have revealed at least two kinds of x - ray emission @xcite . of these ,",
    "the supersoft emission peaks in the euv / soft x - ray range with little or no flux above 1 kev .",
    "we do not discuss supersoft emission further in this paper , because supersoft emission is easily absorbed by the interstellar medium and is unobservable from sources in the galactic center region .",
    "the other component is inferred to be from shocks within the ejected shell , although they are spatially unresolved within the first few years . the x - ray spectrum of the shell component can be modeled as optically thin thermal emission with temperatures in the 110 kev range in the early stages . the line - rich emission detected in some novae at a later stage",
    "are also likely to be from the shell , although they become too soft to be observable from the galactic center region .",
    "the review by @xcite has firmly established that some classical novae are 210 kev x - ray sources .",
    "we now attempt the first systematic survey to see how widespread this component is , and how bright they are on average .",
    "we present a summary in table[hxtab ] and figure[hxcurve ] compiled from the literature , as detailed below .",
    "we focus on the first 1,000 days since eruption . in the figure , we use labels such as `` n1 '' defined in the table . for the three novae detected with _ rosat _ , we list their observed 0.2 - 2.4 kev luminosities and plot them in red .",
    "their 210 kev luminosities are rather uncertain due to the mismatch with the _ rosat _  bandpass .    for other novae ,",
    "we generally present the measured , absorbed 210 kev luminosity . note that the values in table[hxtab ] do not necessarily coincide with those that are reported in the references , sometimes because we have used more recent distance estimates , and because some papers report unabsorbed and/or bolometric luminosities .",
    "descriptions of the descriptions for the first 5 objects in table[hxtab ] can be found in @xcite . of the other novae",
    "observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _  or _",
    "chandra _ , the _ xmm - newton _  detections of v2487  oph ( 986 and 1187 days after outburst ; @xcite ) are thought to be of accretion driven x - rays , and hence we do not include these in our summary .",
    "more recently , v4633  sgr has been detected with _",
    "xmm - newton _  ( 934 , 1083 , and 1265 days after outburst ; @xcite ) .",
    "the authors favor a shell origin , although can not completely exclude accretion origin , either .",
    "our summary includes only the first point ( the other two , beyond our 1,000 day limit , are at similar levels but with larger error bars ) .",
    "this object is an exception in that we have used the unabsorbed 0.210 kev luminosity reported by @xcite .",
    "the spectral model consists of a soft and a hard component , so the 210 kev luminosity should be somewhat lower .",
    "the remainder of classical novae are taken from the _ swift _  survey of classical novae @xcite . as the focus of this paper is the supersoft component , they do not provide luminosities or the conversion factor appropriate for the shell x - rays . since none of the _ swift _",
    "observations are deep enough to enable spectroscopy of the shell x - rays , we have used a single conversion rate of 6.24@xmath13 ergs@xmath14s@xmath2  ( 210 kev ) per 1 _ swift _  xrt ctsks@xmath2 , appropriate for a kt=5 kev bremsstrahlung observed through n@xmath15 = 1@xmath16 @xmath14 . among the objects included in the @xcite compilation , we exclude v723  cas , v1494  aql and v4743  sgr ( observed only after day 1,000 ) ; v1047  cen for which no distance estimate is available ; and v574  pup because its detections are dominated by the supersoft component .",
    "this brief summary ( see also @xcite ) leads to the following conclusion .",
    "these 210 kev x - rays from the ejected shells is a widespread phenomenon : of the 11 observations of 5 classical novae in the 210 kev band ( i.e. , excluding _ rosat _ ) during day 10100 , all but one were detections at above 10@xmath7 ergss@xmath2 .",
    "the lone exception is the observation of v1188  sco on day 98 , with a relatively weak upper limit .",
    "these points are summarized in the form of two histograms ( one for day 1030 , the other for day 30100 ) of 210 kev luminosities of classical novae in figure[hxhisto ] .",
    "the existing data are consistent with the hypothesis that all classical novae are transient 210 kev sources at above 10@xmath7 ergss@xmath2 .",
    "there are variations in the duration and peak luminosity from nova to nova , but some are known to exceed 10@xmath0 ergss@xmath2 .",
    "the case of v382  vel suggests that there is a delay in hard x - ray turn - on of classical novae compared to the optical peak .    the range of plasma temperatures in the ejecta decrease from 2030 kev at hard x - ray turn - on , to @xmath17 1 kev in a few months ( e.g. , @xcite ) . within 1 - 2 years",
    "the nebula may have a rich line spectrum , emitting mostly below 1 kev ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "of the novae discussed above , the time for the hard component of the x - ray emission to cool was about 6 months for the two fast novae @xcite , but was longer ( over 18 months ) for slow novae with massive ejecta @xcite , potentially exceeding the duration of the supersoft phase .",
    "however , the gradual decrease in temperature means that the duration of novae as @xmath182 kev x - ray sources is effectively shorter than the total duration of novae as shell x - ray sources .",
    "even less is known of the x - ray emission from recurrent novae .",
    "i m  nor ( r1 in figure[hxcurve ] ) was not detected 1 month after outburst and was only a moderately strong ( @xmath19 [ d/1 kpc]@xmath20 ergss@xmath2 ) source 6 month past maximum @xcite",
    ". the hard component of ci  aql ( r2 ) was detected 34 and 95 days after outburst at about 7@xmath21 ergss@xmath2   @xcite using the distance of 2.6 kpc @xcite .",
    "in contrast , rs  oph ( r3 ) reached a luminosity in excess of @xmath1810@xmath1 ergss@xmath2  shortly after the outburst peak @xcite . in figure[hxcurve ] , we plot only the observed 210 kev luminosity from early _ swift _  observations for rs  oph ; _ rxte _  measurements are similar . the fast turn - on and high luminosity of rs",
    "oph is due to the existence of an m giant wind , which provides an additional mechanism for x - ray production not available in classical novae or to many recurrent novae , whose mass donors are on or near the main sequence .",
    "the relative paucity of x - ray data on recurrent novae reflects the fact that recurrent novae are much rarer than classical novae . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we will therefore concentrate on classical novae , but the possibility of an rs  oph - like transient near the galactic center region should be kept in mind .",
    "as our summary shows , novae are a known class of x - ray transients with peak luminosities above 10@xmath0 ergss@xmath2 .",
    "thus , they should be considered as a candidate class in discussing galactic center transients .",
    "in fact , novae are the only known class of transients with the right characteristics , as the known neutron star and black hole transients have much higher peak luminosities .",
    "classical novae can be found both in a relatively young population ( e.g. , the galactic disk ) and in the older population ( e.g. , the galactic bulge ) . @xcite",
    "have shown ( their fig .",
    "1 ) that the distribution of the rates of decline of classical novae in the milky way and in m31 perfectly overlap with each other , and both are statistically distinguishable from lmc distribution ( which exhibits a predominance of fast rates of decline ) .",
    "since it is well known from theoretical studies ( e.g. @xcite ) that the rate of decline is a tracer of the mass of the white dwarf in the nova system , we can assume that the main bulk of the progenitors of novae in the milky way and in m31 originates in the same type of stellar population .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have demonstrated that novae in m31 are mainly produced in the bulge ( see also the tabulation of m31 novae by @xcite ) , therefore in view of what is reported above , the same should occur for novae in our galaxy .",
    "a global milky way rate of @xmath324 novae yr@xmath2 has been measured by @xcite by scaling from extragalactic nova surveys @xcite .",
    "a somewhat larger estimate of @xmath335 novae yr@xmath2 has been obtained by @xcite by extrapolating from the current rate of nova discovery in the galaxy ( about 45 novae yr@xmath2 ) and by @xcite based on a microlensing survey of m31 . in the following",
    "we will adopt as an `` educated '' guess a global rate of 30 novae yr@xmath2 , and estimate the rate of novae in a region of the sky within 15 arcmin of the galactic center .",
    "this is roughly the field of view of _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic observations centered on sgr a*.    recent estimates of the ratio nova_rate(disk)/nova_rate(bulge ) range from 0.25 up to 0.40 @xcite . by assuming from @xcite a surface area for the galactic disk of 850 kpc@xmath20 and a typical scale height of 100 pc for disk novae @xcite ,",
    "the density of nova outburst in the milky way disk is @xmath22=0.40.7 @xmath23 novaepc@xmath24yr@xmath2 . assuming a distance from the sun to the galactic center of 8 kpc",
    ", one can find that the rate of disk novae within 15 arcmin of the galactic center is only @xmath25 novae yr@xmath2 .",
    "that is , galactic center x - ray transients are highly unlikely to be disk novae .",
    "more uncertain is the estimate of the nova density in the bulge .",
    "let us assume ( from figure 1 of @xcite ) that most bulge novae are located within 400 pc of the galactic plane .",
    "from figure 2 of @xcite we can assume ( rather optimistically ) that most bulge novae occur within the first kpc from the galactic center .",
    "under these assumptions , we find that bulge novae are distributed within a prolate ellipsoid with a density of @xmath26 novae pc@xmath24yr@xmath2 .",
    "the line of sight region within 15 arcmin of the galactic center encompasses a volume of @xmath27 pc@xmath28 pc = @xmath29 pc@xmath30 .",
    "the expected number of bulge novae in this volume is therefore of order @xmath30.1 novae yr@xmath2 .",
    "the majority of these novae go undiscovered . during 19781993 ,",
    "the average rate of discovery of milky way novae was 3.3 yr@xmath2 @xcite . even though the rate of discovery may have increased in recent years (",
    "about 6 yr@xmath2 are reported in iau circulars since 2001 ) , this still leaves of order 25 classical novae every year that are undiscovered .",
    "we expect that the undiscovered novae are preferentially located in crowded regions and/or behind high interstellar extinction .",
    "both problems are extreme in the galactic center region . therefore , optical observations are unlikely to yield a complete census of the novae in the galactic center region , although wide area ir monitoring should be able to do so .    there have been observations of the galactic center region roughly every 6 months with _ xmm - newton _  for roughly 2 years between 2000 sep and 2002 oct , out of which three transients were discovered @xcite . to this , we add 1 year as the representative duration of novae as a galactic center x - ray transients ( i.e. , bright enough and hard enough to be detectable if they were placed at the galactic center ; the precise value one adopts affects the following numbers only slightly ) . with this assumption",
    ", these _ xmm - newton _  observations should have been sensitive to novae that peaked optically between 1999 sep and 2002 oct , or a period of 3 years .",
    "combined with the above estimate of 0.1 novae per year within 15 arcmin of the galactic center , roughly the field - of - view of _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic cameras , we predict these observations should have detected 0.3 novae as x - ray transients . if this is the true expectation value , there is a 26% chance that at least one of the galactic center transients is a nova according to the poisson distribution ( 4% chance that two or more were novae )",
    ".    most optimistically , then , one or two of the _ xmm - newton _  discovered transients could have been unrecognized novae . on the other hand , it may well be the case that none of these transients are novae .",
    "novae are poorer candidates for the _ chandra _  transients , given the strong concentration of _ chandra _   transients near sgr a * @xcite .",
    "however , given the uncertainties involved both in the nova rate and the transient rate , we consider it advisable to keep novae in mind , particularly as regular monitoring of the galactic center region continues @xcite .",
    "in fact , we can turn this argument around .",
    "there is a possibility that the present estimate of the milky way nova rate ( @xmath330 yr@xmath2 ) is underestimated , because optical monitoring is ineffective in the crowded , high extinction regions around the galactic center .",
    "the degree of central concentration of bulge novae is unknown ; if there is an additional population of novae found preferentially near the galactic center , we would not know it from optical data .",
    "the continuing search for faint x - ray transients in the galactic center region can therefore be considered an important complementary method for discovering classical novae that are otherwise not recognized . since",
    "the galactic center region is already regularly monitored with sensitive x - ray observatories for other purposes , it makes sense to utilize the existing data for this purpose .",
    "classical and recurrent novae are a known class of transient x - ray sources that reach luminosities in the 10@xmath0  10@xmath1 ergss@xmath2  range .",
    "the shell x - ray phase of novae may last months to several years , although they probably soften as they age , gradually making them less conspicuous above 2 kev .",
    "novae have the right spectral and temporal characteristics to explain some of the faint galactic center transients that have been detected with _",
    "chandra _  and with _ xmm - newton _  in recent years .",
    "if the existing literature accurately reflects the rate of x - ray transients near the galactic center , then the known population of classical ( and recurrent ) novae are probably a small , but not negligible , contributor to the overall transient population .",
    "@xcite have argued that dynamical processes may lead to a high space density of x - ray binaries within 1 pc of the galactic center .",
    "that is , the concentration of x - ray emitters is forcing considerations of a new population of objects not seen elsewhere in the galaxy .",
    "we propose that any such studies include white dwarf binaries , since galactic center specific processes could produce an additional population of novae beyond disk and bulge novae that are currently known .",
    "the combination of x - ray monitoring and population synthesis may represent our best hope of obtaining a complete picture of nova populations in the galaxy , because optical surveys can not possibly be effective in the galactic center region .",
    "note that optical surveys fail to detect the majority of galactic novae overall  compare the inferred galactic nova rate of @xmath330 yr@xmath2 to the actual rate of discovery ( @xmath36 yr@xmath2 ) .",
    "_ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  have been monitoring the galactic center region more or less regularly over the last @xmath38 years .",
    "even at 0.1 novae per year within 15 arcmin of the galactic center , it is probable that a nova will be detected as a 210 kev x - ray transient soon , if one hasnt been already .",
    "a concurrent infrared monitoring campaign will be required , however , to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a particular x - ray transient is due to a classical nova .",

    "<S> motivated by the recently discovered class of faint ( 10@xmath010@xmath1 ergss@xmath2 ) x - ray transients in the galactic center region , we investigate the 210 kev properties of classical and recurrent novae . </S>",
    "<S> existing data are consistent with the idea that all classical novae are transient x - ray sources with durations of months to years and peak luminosities in the 10@xmath010@xmath1 ergss@xmath2  range . </S>",
    "<S> this makes classical novae a viable candidate class for the faint galactic center transients . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the rate of classical novae within a 15 arcmin radius region centered on the galactic center ( roughly the field of view of _ xmm - newton _  observations centered on sgr a * ) to be @xmath30.1 per year . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is plausible that some of the galactic center transients that have been announced to date are unrecognized classical novae . </S>",
    "<S> the continuing monitoring of the galactic center region carried out by _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  may therefore provide a new method to detect classical novae in this crowded and obscured region , where optical surveys are not , and can never hope to be , effective . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , x - ray monitoring may provide the best means of testing the completeness of the current understanding of the nova populations . </S>"
