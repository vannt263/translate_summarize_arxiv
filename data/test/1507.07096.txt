    "the rank of a hyperedge is the number of vertices incident with that edge.the representation of hypergraph can be shown in figure 1 . here",
    "m1 , m2 , m3 , m4 are the edge set and each edge set contain one ore more than one vertex .",

    "recognition of line objects is a specific process , which deals with two main problems :    1 .   connectivity preserving .",
    "if two objects are connected in original image , they must be connected also after recognition and the connectivity should be preserved .",
    "2 .   shape preserving .",
    "although it is not important to preserve exact shape or proportions , characteristics of shape should be preserved .",
    "probably the best way how to deal with these two requirements is to use thinning to create skeleton .",
    "the zhang - suen thinning algorithm @xcite is applied here to show how input errors and uncertainties influence the skeleton .    as shown in figure 2 , inaccurate input",
    "can cause not only bad shape recognition but also what is worse ; it can change connectivity of objects .",
    "input picture consists of one object that has shape `` o '' .",
    "the desired skeleton consists of one line object that preserves this shape and also preserves connectivity ( it is not connected with other object ) . on the other hand , skeleton which was acquired without any pre - processing ,",
    "like any morphological operation like dilation and erosion consists of more objects that hardly describe original shape and it does not preserve connectivity of its origin at all .    figure 3 demonstrate the possibilities of using morphological operators dilation(d ) and erosion(e ) using hypergraph in pre - processing phase to eliminate most common errors like noise , line fuzz , holes and separations .",
    "picture a is binary input from which it is possible to get pictures j , g , b and e by using different number and order of dilation and erosion operations using hypergraph .",
    "while only one hypergraph dilation and erosion was used in pictures g and b. pictures j and e show possibilities of using higher number of the same morphological operations using hypergraph one after another .",
    "opening operation using hypergraph is good for noise reduction and line fuzz removal .",
    "picture b shows that all noise and small line fuzz was removed .",
    "its effect depends on number of iterations ie , number of dilation and erosion as it is shown in picture e , where two iterations were used .",
    "if too much iteration is used there is a danger of erasing real parts of the object ( line fuzz ) or whole objects at all ( noise ) .",
    "similar situation is shown in pictures g and j , where hypergraph closing is used .",
    "this operation causes holes reduction . also there is a threat of using too much iteration as it can fill objects that can lead to loss of their line characteristic morphological operations like dilation , erosion using hypergraph in pre - processing phase to eliminate most common errors like noise , line fuzz , holes and separations",
    "the effect of hypergraph based morphological operators in pre processing is shown with the binary noise image .",
    "the result of thinning with or without hypergraph based morphological operators is studied .",
    "figure 4 , is the original noisy image and the result of thinning image without morphological operations are shown in figure 5 . but the resultant image which contain some amount of noise . consider the figure 7 , which is the resultant image of thinning using morphological operators , is better than the previous result .",
    "so the effect of morphological operation which leads to eliminate most common errors like noise , line fuzz , holes and separations . on the other hand , skeleton , which was acquired without any preprocessing ,",
    "consists of more objects that hardly describe original shape and it does not preserve connectivity of its original at all .",
    "we studied the different morphological operations on the hypergraph .",
    "thinning process which can be performed on the images using morphological operators using hypergraph and which gives noise free skeletonized image as output .",
    "the thinning using morphological operators shows better results than compared with thinning without using morphological operators.the morphological operations have many application in the satellite imaging , medical imaging technique etc .",
    "the technique can be used as the effective preprocessing step in the recognition of handwritten characters , number plate detection .",
