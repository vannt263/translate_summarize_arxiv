    "<S> was observed with distinct coma emission in excess of a model nucleus at a heliocentric distance of 5.0  au . </S>",

    "<S> ht50 ( linear - neat ) showed evidence for crystalline silicates in the spectrum obtained at 3.2  au and we derive a silicate - to - carbon dust ratio of 0.6 . </S>",
