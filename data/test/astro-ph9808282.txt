    "the joint effort of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and large ground based telescopes in the last few years has produced a real breakthrough in our understanding of the history of formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "deep photometric multicolor imaging such as the hubble deep field ( hdf , williams et al .",
    "1996 ) together with spectroscopic information ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have started to sketch a sort of cosmic timetable that provides important constraints to theories for the formation of cosmic structure ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . besides global properties ( @xcite )",
    ", the superb resolution of the hst allows us to study the evolution of different morphological types separately , in particular to clarify the history of elliptical galaxies ( e / s0 ) .",
    "the intermediate redshift spectroscopic data ( e.g. @xcite ) suggest a mostly passive evolution of old stellar populations that seems to be confirmed by photometric studies at higher redshift ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to push the investigation to redshift significantly greater than 1 , infrared ( ir ) photometry ( corresponding to optical rest - frame emission ) is needed ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . the extremely red objects with ( r@xmath8k)@xmath9 ( equivalently ( r@xmath8k)@xmath10 ) found with ir surveys are generally thought to be high redshift elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite )",
    "however , due to their subarcsecond sizes , hst is needed to explore in detail the morphology of these objects ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this letter we report the discovery of a `` r - h dropout '' ( figs .  [",
    "fig : im ] * a * , * b * and * c * in the hdfs test image .",
    "the morphology , the size and the colors ( r - h and i - h ) strongly suggest the object to be an `` old '' elliptical galaxy ( or bulge - dominated object ) at @xmath6 and therefore with a very high formation redshift ( @xmath11 ) , somehow similar to the `` old '' red galaxy found by spinrad et al .",
    "( 1997 ) at redshift @xmath12 .",
    "many extremely red objects have been found in the last years ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) using ground based ir photometry , thus with poor morphological information . at the opposite , the object we present in this letter , thanks to the hst angular resolution , is resolved and we can measure the light profile and the effective radius ( similar objects are being detected with nicmos , e.g. mc carthy et al , 1998 , but the luminosity profile has not been measured ) .",
    "the luminosity profile is well described by an @xmath0 law . models with dust are also considered to explain the extremely red colors , given the growing evidence for significant amounts of dust in high redshift galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the hubble constant is assumed to be 100 @xmath13 km / s / mpc , with @xmath14 where needed .",
    "during the hdfs test program ( williams et al . 1997 ) images of the candidate hdfs field were taken with the f160w filter of the near infrared camera and multi object spectrometer ( nicmos ) on board the hst ( fig .",
    "[ fig : im ] * a * ) , and in the optical r band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : im ] * b * ) with the 4 m blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "follow up i band photometry was obtained on may 13 1998 at the same telescope ( fig .",
    "[ fig : im ] * c * ) .",
    "twelve nicmos camera 3 ( nic3 ) images of the field were taken in multiaccum mode ( 640 s each ) .",
    "the images were obtained at six different pointings in order to correct for bad pixels and to recover the information lost to undersampling of nic3 ( approximately @xmath15 pixel size ) .",
    "the `` pedestal '' , an unpredictable bias that affects the nicmos images ( see the nicmos image anomalies web page at url www.stsci.edu/ftp/instrument_news/  nicmos / nicmos_anomalies.html ) , was removed using the pedestal estimation software by r.  p. van der marel , and scripts developed by one of us ( med ) .",
    "the dithered images were combined on a subsampled grid ( @xmath161 pixel size , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : im ] * a * ) using the drizzle iraf / stsdas task ( @xcite ) .",
    "a bad pixel and cosmic ray mask was obtained by using the iraf / stsdas package ditherii .",
    "the object appears resolved on the final drizzled images , but to be sure that this was not an artifact of the reduction procedure we performed a @xmath17 test on the single calibrated frames . for each image we measured the fwhm along the x and y axis of the galaxy and the two nearby stars ( using the midas command center / gauss ) .",
    "we estimated the error on the fwhm to be the standard deviation of the values measured on the different frames ( about @xmath18 ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath17 of the values with respect to their average is therefore 1 ( by definition ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath17 of the measured fwhms computed with respect to the average stellar fwhm is @xmath19 , showing that the object is resolved .    the luminosity profile of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] ) was obtained by fitting elliptical isophotes to the image with a modified version of the midas command fit / ell3 specifically designed to deal with undersampled images ( mller , stiavelli & zeilinger , 1995 ) .    in order to fit a luminosity profile law to the data point",
    "it is crucial to determine the psf very accurately .",
    "an unexpected deformation of the nicmos dewar pushed nic3 out of the range reachable by the focusing device ( pupil alignment mechanism ) and therefore nic3 is always somewhat out of focus .",
    "thermal breathing of the instrument ( that is significant during long exposures ) and the combination of multiple dithered exposures add further uncertainty and broadening to the psf . for these reasons",
    "the stars in the field are a better approximation of the real psf than the psfs obtained with tiny tim 4.4 ; the main residual difference may be caused by position - dependent features of the nic3 psf . in order to have an estimate of the errors due to the psf , we fitted the profile with different psfs : the two nearest stars and two `` synthetic '' ones computed as follows .",
    "a psf was calculated using tiny tim 4.4 ( using a 15 mas jitter ) on a subsampled grid ( @xmath20 pixel size ) in the same position of a star in the hdfs test image .",
    "it was then rebinned to the scale of the drizzled image in order to obtain a psf centered in the same sub - pixel of the real star . under the assumption that the `` true '' psf ( @xmath21 ) is the convolution of the tiny tim psf ( @xmath22 ) with a position independent broadening function ( @xmath23 ) due mostly to the breathing of nicmos and the drizzling of the single dithered images",
    ", we derived the function @xmath23 using the midas fourier transform commands .",
    "the broadening functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 were derived for the two nearest stars .",
    "using a tiny tim psf ( @xmath26 ) centered on the galaxy center and the broadening functions we obtained two `` synthetic stars '' syn1=@xmath27 and syn2@xmath28 .",
    "as we were interested in checking the robustness of the results with respect to psf uncertainties , we performed the fits using both the two real stars and the two `` synthetic '' stars .",
    "we fitted an @xmath0 law to the isophotal profile , using a code described , e.g. , by carollo et al .",
    "the fit obtained with the four psfs are in excellent mutual agreement and reproduce the data very well ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] * a * ) .",
    "if an exponential profile component is added , the best fit is obtained for a very small exponential component and a practically unchanged @xmath0 component .",
    "at the opposite , an exponential disk by itself gives a poor description of the profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] * b * ) .",
    "the photometric parameters were also determined with a two - dimensional fit code , described in treu et al .",
    "the total error is mainly due to residual psf mismatches , to the specific technique ( profiles or 2d fit ) , and to errors in the sky subtraction .",
    "the psf and the technique dependent uncertainties can be estimated from the scatter of all the photometric parameters derived , while the sky - subtraction error has been estimated by varying the sky level ( @xmath29 % in @xmath30 and @xmath31 mag in m ) .",
    "the average values of the effective radius and magnitude , obtained with different techniques , models and psfs , are respectively @xmath32 and m=@xmath33 .",
    "ten dithered r band exposures ( 300 s each ) were obtained with the prime focus ccd ( pfccd ) imager at the ctio blanco 4 m telescope on may 2 1997 , using the detector site 2k # 6 .",
    "the night was photometric with seeing @xmath34 . the same field was observed in the i band on may 13 1998 ( unfortunately almost full moon was present ) with the tyson - bernstein mosaic imager .",
    "ccd # 3 , also a site 2k , was pointed at the pfccd field , obtaining 14 x 200 s dithered exposures .",
    "the night was photometric , with @xmath35 seeing .",
    "the images were reduced and combined in standard way using iraf .",
    "the photometric calibration of the r band was done by bootstrapping the photometry from a 0.9 m to the 4 m image .",
    "three relatively bright ( i @xmath36 18 ) stars near the nicmos position were calibrated on the i - band frame by reference to seven stars in landolt ( 1992 ) sa 107 .",
    "both were also checked with the nominal zeropoints from the instrument manuals .",
    "the accuracy of the calibration is about 0.1 mag , which is good enough for our purposes .    the galaxy , which is quite evident on the nicmos images , is undetected in both the r and i ctio image ( figs .",
    "[ fig : im ] * b * and * c * ) .",
    "thus we can only set an upper limit to the r and i band luminosities .",
    "the nearest detected source is at @xmath37 on the r band image .",
    "the limiting magnitudes , computed by measuring the sky noise ( @xmath38k ) and correcting the resulting flux for the seeing losses , are m@xmath39 and m@xmath4024.7 ab mag at the two - sigma level",
    ".    a more accurate limit can be given by considering the statistical distribution of the counts on the detector for a given source of intensity @xmath41 and a given background of zero average and variance @xmath38k@xmath42 .",
    "the 95 % confidence level ( cl ) limit is m@xmath43 and m@xmath4025.2 abmag .",
    "the limits on the color are therefore ( r - h)@xmath3@xmath44 and ( i - h)@xmath3@xmath453 , at the two - sigma level , considering only the sky variance , but ( r - h)@xmath46@xmath453.9 and ( i - h)@xmath3@xmath453.5 , at the 95 % cl with the more accurate algorithm .",
    "the morphology and the ir light profile suggest that the object is a high redshift `` old '' elliptical galaxy .",
    "but the strongest clues in favor of a high redshift elliptical galaxy are the colors . to better constrain this identification",
    "we have computed the ( r - h)@xmath3 and ( i - h)@xmath3 colors of a set of synthetic spectra of single burst elliptical galaxies ( bruzual & charlot , 1993 ; gissel 96 version ) as a function of redshift . a standard salpeter imf and metallicities @xmath47 and @xmath48 have been used .",
    "the lower metallicity has been selected to be representative of the low metallicity environment that one could expect to find in primordial stellar populations . in figs .",
    "[ fig : za ] * a * and * b * the contour plots of ( r - h)@xmath3 and ( i - h)@xmath3 ( isochromes ) as a function of redshift and age of the synthetic galaxy are shown .",
    "for each given redshift the galaxy age has to be less than the age of the universe , which is overplotted as thin lines for two different values of the cosmological parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in practice , only the points above the maximum of the lower branches of the two isochromes ( i and r ) , and below the thin line for the selected cosmology , are consistent with the observed colors . as can be seen ,",
    "the colors support the identification as an `` old '' elliptical galaxy at redshift @xmath51 for the solar metallicity models .",
    "the lower limit in redshift is even more stringent if we consider low metallicity spectra , because the balmer jump is intrinsically shallower .",
    "a redshift @xmath6 would also give an effective radius in the usual range for elliptical galaxies ( @xmath7 kpc ) .",
    "the colors are well reproduced also for much higher redshift ( @xmath36715 ) .",
    "a significant content of dust ( which can be found in high redshift star - forming galaxies , see e.g. soifer et al .",
    "1998 , cimatti et al .  1998 ) could redden the colors of a given galactic spectrum and redshift .",
    "for this reason , the same isochromes were computed after reddening the spectra for dust absorption following the extinction law given by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) with a@xmath52 , a@xmath53e(b - v ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig : za ] ( c ) and ( d ) the isochromes are shown in the low redshift ( @xmath54@xmath55 ) range .",
    "the colors are now reproduced by lower redshift models ( @xmath56 ) , and therefore the object could be a high redshift `` old '' elliptical galaxy with significant dust content .",
    "the object , that has been selected as an `` r - h dropout '' in the test image of the hdfs , is clearly resolved on the nicmos image and shows an @xmath0 law profile with an effective radius of @xmath57 . the colors ( r - h)@xmath3 and ( i - h)@xmath3 are well reproduced by synthetic models of `` old '' elliptical galaxies at redshift @xmath6 or at higher redshift ( up to @xmath36 15 ) by younger ones ( sect .  [ sec : id ] ) , implying therefore a very high formation redshift .",
    "alternatively it could be a lower redshift ( @xmath56 ) elliptical galaxy with a significant amount of dust .",
    "high redshift clusters of galaxies have been photometrically identified in the vicinity of qsos ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore this galaxy may possibly be a companion to the qso j2233 - 60 , which is located @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath59 mpc ( physical distance ) from the hdfs nic3 field .",
    "this identification would then lead to @xmath60 compatible with the colors and size that we have observed . at this redshift",
    ", h@xmath61=21.7 would imply an absolute magnitude m@xmath62 ( @xmath49=1 , @xmath50=0 ) and m@xmath63 ( @xmath49=0.3 , @xmath50=0.7 ) which are normal for a 1.5 gyr - old elliptical .",
    "further spectroscopic and photometric investigation are needed to measure the redshift , to study in detail the stellar population , to clarify the role of dust , and to identify possible high redshift companions .",
    "the faintness of the object though , makes it extremely hard to measure the redshift with 4 m class telescopes , while it will be feasible in a few hours with the isaac spectrograph at the vlt ( see the vlt - isaac web page www.eso.org/instruments/isaac ) .",
    "the authors would like to thank r. p. van der marel , who developed the pedestal estimation software used for the pedestal subtraction .",
    "tt would like to thank prof .",
