    "there are basically two approaches to modeling the edge and scrape - off layer ( sol ) regions in magnetically confined plasmas : mean field transport models and turbulence models . in the first approach@xcite , mean field",
    "fluid equations are solved in a realistic geometry typically including the divertor and x - point regions .",
    "these models have very detailed descriptions of collisions , neutral particles , impurities , and material surfaces , whereas turbulent transport is not calculated self - consistently but modeled by effective turbulent diffusion terms .",
    "turbulence models@xcite take a different approach . here ,",
    "a detailed description of the turbulence is the main goal , whereas the level of detail of collisions , neutral particles , impurities and material surfaces , if included in the models at all , is crude compared with the highly detailed descriptions in mean field transport models .",
    "furthermore , in order to reduce the computational requirements the magnetic field geometry is often simplified .",
    "both approaches have provided useful results in their respective regimes of validity .",
    "nevertheless , several open questions in contemporary fusion plasma research require that these complementary approaches are merged .",
    "examples are : the formation of a elevated density shoulder@xcite as the particle density approaches the greenwald density limit and the associated changes of filament properties@xcite , the high particle density front@xcite on the high field side of single null diverted plasmas , and eventually the possible influence of turbulent transport on the transition to the detached@xcite divertor regime .    here",
    ", we present a step towards more detailed edge and sol turbulence models by showing how classical collisional transport across the magnetic field is included in drift - fluid models@xcite based on the braginskii fluid closure@xcite . compared with neoclassical transport ,",
    "classical collisional transport across the magnetic field is small in most regions of a magnetically confined fusion plasma . in turbulence dominated systems",
    "collisional transport is important because of its diffusive nature which inevitably determines the smallest possible scale length of the turbulence below which the turbulent energy is dissipated .",
    "it is well - known that turbulence behaves remarkably different when collisional dissipation is completely neglected compared with the situation where a very small but finite dissipation is present .",
    "the results of neoclassical transport theory are concerned with the steady - state and does not take turbulence into account nor resolve the much faster turbulent time - scale . in the pfirsch - schl \" uter regime ,",
    "neoclassical transport is a result of collisional diffusive transport along the magnetic field in combination with guiding - center drifts due to magnetic field inhomogeneity . on the turbulent time - scale",
    ", it is therefore not evident that neoclassical effects through parallel collisional transport is the dominant regulator of turbulence in particular when the spatial scale of the turbulence is small as in e.g. , drift wave turbulence .",
    "a consistent model for perpendicular collisional transport may therefore be of importance for the interplay between collisions and turbulence and certainly provide a valuable validation tool for models which do not take classical perpendicular collisional transport into account .",
    "moreover , classical perpendicular transport is believed to play a role for the perpendicular convection of filaments in the sol region .",
    "a filament at the outboard midplane typically has a size which is on the order of @xmath0 ion gyroradii , but when then filament approaches the x - point region the perpendicular scale length can easily be smaller than the ion gyroradius due the strong magnetic shear near the x - point@xcite . in that case",
    "the perpendicular conductivity and viscosity are important mechanisms for closing the filament current loop@xcite and thereby modify the filament convection and possibly decouple perturbations above and below the x - point .",
    "finally , classical perpendicular transport are important in other fully ionized plasmas without neoclassical transport , e.g. cylindrical plasmas .    in drift - fluid models ,",
    "the components of the momentum density equations perpendicular to the magnetic field are solved iteratively essentially under the assumption that the dynamics is evolving much slower than the ion gyration time scale . in this limit , every force density , including resistivity and collisional viscosity , gives rise to a perpendicular drift@xcite .",
    "most of the collisional drifts are included in transport models@xcite but not in a way which provides energy conservation . in turbulence models , on the other hand , the collisional drifts are usually neglected or do only include selected collisional effects@xcite . in a model",
    "including ion temperature dynamics , we show how these collisional terms in combination with heat fluxes , heat exchange terms , and viscous heating terms in the electron and ion pressure equations are included in drift - fluid turbulence models in a consistent way .",
    "consistency here mainly refers to energy conservation . in this paper",
    "we show that collisional transport across the magnetic field can be included in drift - fluid models without altering the energy theorem@xcite .",
    "for example , we show that the collisional viscous damping of turbulence and mean flows gives rise to a conservative energy transfer between the kinetic energy and the ion thermal energy . in other words",
    ", collisions can be added to drift - fluid models without introducing energy sinks or sources .",
    "the inclusion of perpendicular collisional transport in the drift - fluid equation gives rise to diffusion of particle density , momentum , and ion and electron pressure , and hence potentially renders the common use of artificial diffusion terms in turbulence models redundant .",
    "the collisonal terms are complex functions of the fluid and the electromagnetic field variables",
    ". thus when included in turbulence models , they place significant demands on computing powers .",
    "therefore , we also present a partly linearized model for the collisional transport across the magnetic field which allows significantly faster computing times .",
    "the model is embedded in the hot edge - sol electrostatic ( hesel ) model@xcite , the successor of the esel model@xcite .",
    "hesel is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) model describing interchange turbulence in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field at the outboard midplane of a tokamak .",
    "it evolves the particle density , the vorticity , and the electron and ion pressures .",
    "we show that our partly linearised collision terms , including inter species energy exchange , do not alter the energy theorem , and we show by means of 1d numerical simulations without turbulence that the simplified and full models give very similar results .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : perpcolltrans ] we describe how collisional effects influence the dynamics perpendicular to the magnetic field in a low - frequency drift - fluid turbulence model .",
    "we derive the global energy theorem and discuss energy exchange mechanisms due to collisions . in section [ sec : heselmodel ] a simplified model for collisional effects is derived which is included in the hesel model also presented here .",
    "numerical simulations of the full and simplified models for the perpendicular collisional effects are presented , and finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarise our findings and draw conclusions .",

    "the diamagnetic drift is the fluid representation of the particle grad - b and curvature drifts , and the magnetization current associated with the gyrating charged particles@xcite .",

    "@xmath242 is the time at which the particle density amplitude is half the initial value according to the analytical solution of the 1d diffusion equation .",
    "we have investigated various initial conditions but have chosen this specific case where the initial temperatures are not identical in order to demonstrate the energy exchange mechanisms within the model .",

    "the time evolution of the particle density @xmath62 does not vary significantly between the three models .",
    "the sd and hesel models give almost identical results whereas the fm model shows a slightly flatter profile .",
    "for the electron and ion temperatures and pressures the fm model and the hesel models agree quite well .",
    "the sd model profiles , on the other hand , significantly differs from the profiles of the hesel and fm models .",
    "the presence of energy exchange terms in the hesel and fm models is evident . here , the electron and ion temperatures are equilibrated whereas the absence of an energy coupling in the sd model is evident , particularly in the ion temperature . in conclusion",

    "the implications of the choice of perpendicular collisional model in turbulence simulations is not investigated here but is left for future work .",

    "in this paper we have demonstrated how perpendicular collisional effects can be incorporated in low - frequency drift - fluid turbulence models .",
    "based on the electrostatic limit of the braginskii fluid equations@xcite , it was shown how resistivity and viscosity give rise to perpendicular fluid drifts which when inserted into the fluid moment equations provide an energy conserving closed model governing the time - evolution of the particle density , vorticity , and electron and ion pressure .",
    "we demonstrated that resistivity gives rise to energy exchange between the electron and ion thermal energies and that viscous effects due to ion - ion collisions transfer energy between the modified kinetic and the ion thermal energies .",
    "it was also shown that collisions do not imply energy sinks and sources in the global energy theorem , but merely provide conservative energy transfer terms . in conclusion",
    ", it was shown that the inclusion of perpendicular collisional transport in drift - fluid models gives rise to perpendicular diffusion in all moment equations , which obviates the need for explicit artificial diffusion .",
    "based on the general results , we also derived a simplified 2d model aiming at describing interchange driven turbulent transport in the vicinity of the outboard midplane .",
    "the model is named hesel and , as the predecessor esel , it is aimed at being computational efficient allowing the model equations to be time integrated for multiple turbulence de - correlation times .",
    "the validity of the simplified collisional dynamics in hesel was investigated by means of numerical simulations without turbulence .",
