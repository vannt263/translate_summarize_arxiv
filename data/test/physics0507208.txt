    "in recent years , optical frequency metrology has made spectacular progress with the implementation of femtosecond frequency combs @xcite .",
    "today , the precision and stability of laser frequencies reaches beyond the 10@xmath2-level , removing the last obstacles for an ultimate investigation of possible new frequency standards outpassing the performances of the actual cesium atomic clock by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , many experimental applications require lasers with less stringent performances , like a sub - mhz linewidth and an absolute frequency stability better than this spectral width for time scales of a minute . in our experiment @xcite , probing of an atomic transition requires a narrow interrogation laser linewidth , which can be obtained in a straightforward way by stabilizing a laser on a fabry - perot cavity of high finesse .",
    "the use of the pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) locking technique @xcite permits to counteract rapid frequency fluctuations and allows to obtain laser linewidths largely inferior to 100  khz .    to reach integration times of a couple of minutes , frequency drifts have to be suppressed , which requires stabilisation of the length of the reference cavity of the interrogation laser",
    "this can be realized by a maximum isolation from mechanical , acoustic and thermal perturbations , or by an absolute stabilisation on an atomic transition , generally by making use of an additional ( diode ) laser set - up .",
    "stabilisation on an atomic transition is often made by the saturated absorption technique to avoid doppler broadening effects in a gas at room temperature .",
    "the employed crossover transitions have spectral widths of about 10  mhz ( for example rb : 5.9  mhz , cs : 14  mhz ) , limiting the attainable frequency stabilities to almost three orders of magnitude below these values .",
    "very few different techniques have been used to assure an absolute - length stabilisation of a reference cavity .",
    "they all compare the frequency difference between two eigenmodes of a reference cavity with an external rf frequency applied to a phase or frequency modulation device .",
    "the dual - frequency modulation ( dfm ) technique with two phase modulators ( eom ) in a row has been used in @xcite .",
    "it has been applied in a slightly modified set - up to measure the frequency of molecular transitions with a uncertainty of 2 @xmath3 @xcite , where the change in free - spectral range ( fsr ) of an optical cavity is tracked by a servo on an eom .",
    "another implementation is reduced to the use of a single eom @xcite .",
    "long - baseline interferometry uses double modulation techniques to assure length determination of the interferometer arms which can reach a relative uncertainty of 10@xmath1 @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    "we describe a new scheme for the use of a dfm method for the absolute - length stabilisation of an optical cavity for measurements on timescales reaching from several seconds up to hours . in order to avoid a long - term drift of the laser frequency",
    "we have chosen to stabilize the length of the reference cavity by locking the frequency difference between its n@xmath0 and its ( n+1)@xmath0 longitudinal mode .",
    "the frequency difference is generated by an acousto - optical modulator at a fixed value matching half of the fsr of the reference cavity .",
    "the high accuracy and stability of a frequency synthesizer are thus transferred to the fsr .",
    "the use of acousto - optic modulators at frequencies largely beyond 100  mhz allows to stabilize short optical cavities .",
    "furthermore , the described method is independent from the existence of nearby atomic transitions .",
    "we have demonstrated excellent frequency stability for periods up to an hour .",
    "the complete experimental set - up is shown in figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the 729-nm - laser is a broad - area diode laser ( bal ) mounted in an external cavity to assure single - mode lasing and to reduce its linewidth @xcite . the diode is then stabilized onto a reference cavity by using the pound - drever - hall lock @xcite .",
    "the laser light is phase - modulated at 40 mhz by an eom .",
    "the signal reflected by the cavity is composed of two totally reflected sidebands and a central carrier whose phase depends on the frequency difference with a cavity resonance .",
    "detected by a rapid photodiode , the beat signals between the carrier and the sidebands allow to generate an error signal that permits frequency corrections up to the cut - off frequency of the cavity and phase corrections beyond .",
    "our present goal is to enhance the long - term stability of the optical reference cavity .",
    "the cavity has a finesse of about 1000 and the spacer between the two mirrors is made out of invar .",
    "this home - made cavity spacer has an outer diameter of 50  mm , an inner diameter of 10  mm , and a length of about 300  mm .",
    "the cavity is formed by commercial broad - band mirrors ( 700 - 900  nm ) , a plane and a curved one ( radius of curvature 2 m ) .",
    "the plane mirror is mounted on a piezo - electric transducer ( pzt ) allowing to adjust the length of the cavity by application of a dc - voltage from 0  v up to 150  v corresponding to a maximum length variation of about 2  @xmath4 m .",
    "in the course of a day , the reference cavity undergoes a slow frequency drift mainly due to temperature variations , in a lab where the ambient temperature is stabilized to approximately one degree .",
    "the instantaneous linewidth of the diode laser locked onto the reference cavity has been measured by an autocorrelation technique @xcite .",
    "the beat signal of a part of the laser beam with a second part of the same beam which has passed through 10  km of optical fiber is shown in figure [ fig : larg729 ] .",
    "this beat signal has been acquired with a hp esa 1500a spectrum analyzer at a 3  khz bandwidth . while the free - running laser ( figure [ fig : larg729 ] a ) ) has a linewidth of the order of several hundred khz , which is a typical result for a broad - area diode laser in an external cavity , the linewidth of the locked laser is lower than 25 khz ( figure [ fig : larg729 ] b ) ) .",
    "this is achieved by feeding the frequency corrections of the pdh - signal to different elements in the diode laser cavity setup .",
    "slow fluctuations ( up to 200 hz ) are corrected by the piezo - electric element supporting the cavity grating with a resistor - bias stabilization integrator ( pseudo - integrator ) @xcite .",
    "intermediate corrections ( up to 20 khz ) are applied via the diode laser current source , and rapid frequency corrections are made directly on the anode of the diode laser making use of a fet mounted as a passive voltage - current convertor @xcite .",
    "the difference in gain between slow and rapid corrections is approximately 20  db .",
    "the total bandwidth of the servo loop is about 1  mhz .    to increase the stability of the reference cavity in order to avoid a long - term drift of the laser we have chosen to stabilize the length of the cavity by locking the frequency difference between its n@xmath0 and its ( n+1)@xmath0 longitudinal mode .",
    "the frequency difference is fixed by a highly stable frequency synthesizer driving the acousto - optical modulator at a frequency corresponding to half of the cavity fsr .",
    "we use an aeroflex 2030-series frequency synthesizer with an internal frequency standard at 10 mhz ( ocxo ) having a 0.1  hz accuracy and a fractional frequency stability at 1 minute of about 5 @xmath5 @xcite .    in the described locking scheme",
    ", the frequency of the diode laser corresponds to the n@xmath0 multiple of the cavity s free spectral range @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mode number , @xmath8 the fresnel phase shift due to the curvature of the cavity mirrors , and @xmath9 the phase shift which occurs upon reflection due to the finite conductivity of the mirrors . in the following ,",
    "we are only interested in the frequency difference of two neighboring modes , we may thus assume that these phase shifts are almost identical and that their differences can therefore be neglected .",
    "in addition to the pdh lock of the diode onto the reference cavity , one part of the laser output which has double - passed an acousto - optic modulator is injected into the cavity .",
    "note that in our set - up this second beam enters the cavity from the opposite side of the pdh lock .",
    "this beam has been offset in frequency by two times @xmath10 = 249.82  mhz fixing the fsr of the reference cavity .",
    "@xmath11    for the lock loop the driving frequency of the aom is modulated at @xmath12=22  khz with a 100  khz amplitude corresponding to 6  % of the width of the airy peak of the cavity .",
    "the light reflected by the cavity is then collected by a photodiode and demodulated at 22  khz by a lock - in amplifier .",
    "the output of this lock - in is integrated before being sent to the piezo - electric transducer controlling the length of the reference cavity . for long - term corrections a time constant of 1 second has been chosen .    in the present optical set - up the two photodiodes generating the error signals are sensitive to both parts of the beam . to avoid crosstalk of the photodiodes in response of both beams",
    ", we have separated the counter - reaction by choosing different bandwidths for the two lock loops . in practice , our locking electronics has been realized with a pure integrator in the length - stabilisation of the reference cavity and a pseudo - integrator in the pdh lock limiting the gain at zero frequency . as a consequence , at frequencies below the hertz ,",
    "the corrections applied to the diode laser are negligible compared to those sent to the fsr lock .",
    "the separation of the locks by their bandwidths is the most simple solution , as both loops work on different timescales . in a more general scheme ,",
    "the lock loops could be separated by making use of orthogonal polarizations . however , the optical separation should be made with glan - laser prisms as the polarization beam - splitter cubes used in our set - up present an extinction ratio of only 0.01 .",
    "a second essential point for a stable configuration of the locking scheme is to choose a frequency modulation @xmath12 of the fsr lock larger than the cut - off of the current corrections in the diode - lock ( @xmath13 2 khz ) . at small frequency modulation values",
    "( e.g. 1 khz ) the gain of the pdh servo is high ( 55db for the electronic part ) producing a strong reaction by correcting modulation as noise . as a consequence",
    "the lock of the laser on the reference cavity becomes unstable .",
    "for best results , we have chosen to modulate the driving frequency of the aom at 22 khz with an amplitude of 100 khz . at this frequency",
    "the electronic pdh gain is about 35 db , and the modulation does not perturb the pdh lock .",
    "the overall response of the lock is given by the resolution of the employed frequency synthesizer .",
    "in fact , @xmath14 and the ratio of the fsr to diode frequency is , in our case , @xmath15    ) , the laser locked by pdh method on the optical cavity ( @xmath16 ) , and with the fsr of the cavity locked on the frequency synthesizer ( @xmath17 ) .",
    ", width=340 ]    the time constant of the locking electronics is about one second to assure a high long - term stability of the system , the timescale of interest for our experiment is of the order of a couple of minutes . to test the achieved stability ,",
    "we have therefore measured the evolution of the diode laser frequency every 30 seconds making use of a wavemeter , where the employed reference wavelength is a temperature stabilized hene transition at 632.8  nm .",
    "the absolute precision of the wavemeter is better than 40 mhz , which has been verified by the frequency resolution obtained on the atomic transition of a single calcium ion during periods of a couple of hours @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of the diode laser frequency is reported in figure [ fig : evolp ] , the straight lines in this graph are linear fits to the acquired data , reflecting the long - term frequency drifts . on the considered time scales ( 1 minute to three hours ) the observed frequency variations have all presented a linear evolution .",
    "the lower curve in figure [ fig : evolp ] reflects the frequency of the diode laser in external cavity without any additional stabilisation .",
    "the frequency drift is almost 800 mhz per hour , mainly due to thermal drifts of the high - power diode - laser component , that is a very typical value for a non - stabilized laser .",
    "the upper curve shows the fluctuations of the diode frequency as it is stabilized onto the described invar cavity .",
    "a reduction of the frequency drift to values below 100 mhz per hour can be observed .",
    "the center graph monitors the frequency of the diode locked to the reference cavity with the cavity s",
    "fsr stabilized by the synthesizer frequency . the apparent drift of the frequency has been reduced to less than 3  khz per second , corresponding to a frequency variation per hour of less than 9 mhz limited by the frequency stability of the employed frequency synthesizer .",
    "we have presented a method to stabilize the length of an optical reference cavity on a long timescale implementing the lock of its fsr by an aom .",
    "the corner stone of this method is a thorough frequency separation of the two lock loops , the result is dependant of the quality of the locking schemes adopted .",
    "the stability reached by this method is only limited by the technical performance of the employed frequency synthesizer .",
    "the implemented technique is a pure frequency lock , no phase condition has to be fulfilled .",
    "compared to existing dfm methods which have been designed using phase modulators , the use of an acousto - optical modulator in our scheme allows application of the technique to cavities which are shorter than some tens of centimeters .",
    "furthermore , the presented method can be used in a wavelength regime where no atomic transitions are accessible .",
    "the stability performances described could be easily improved by using an external frequency standard with higher precision and stability for the frequency synthesizer fixing the length of the optical cavity ."
