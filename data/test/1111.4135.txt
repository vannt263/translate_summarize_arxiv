    "it was found that the relaxation of charge and spin are given by rates which differ from each other due to coulomb repulsion . since the reduced density matrix of a qd with a single orbital level with spin is four dimensional , there are thus three rates which govern the relaxation of the diagonal elements of the density matrix towards equilibrium ( plus one which is always zero and corresponds to the stable stationary state ) .",
