    "hii galaxies are low - metallicity objects undergoing violent star formation @xcite.their optical spectra show strong emission lines ( recombination lines of hydrogen and helium , as well as forbidden lines of elements like oxygen , neon , nitrogen , sulfur , among others ) that are very similar to the spectra of extragalactic hii regions ( e.g. @xcite ) . among them",
    "we can find the least chemically - evolved galaxies in the local universe.due to their proximity they offer ideal laboratories for studying massive star formation with an accuracy and spatial resolution that can not be achieved in similar studies in the distant universe .",
    "the integral field unit ( ifu ) spectrographs allow simultaneous spectra to be taken of extended objects . from this",
    ", we can learn how the interstellar medium ( ism ) is structured , and derive physical conditions and chemical properties corresponding to individual star - forming knots and external ionized gas component ( located at more or less one kpc from the main body of the galaxy ) .",
    "the study of the distribution of these properties is an important issue for our understanding of the interplay between the massive stellar population and the ism , unveiling the mechanisms that govern star formation .",
    "studying the chemical abundance distribution of the ionized gas can be used as a tool to explore the possible chemical evolution paths .",
    "our sample is composed by three hii galaxies : izw18 , iizw70 and iizw71 .",
    "izw18 , since pioneering work of @xcite , has remained a unique object for the study of the chemical evolution galaxies , given its very low oxygen abundance , approximately 1/50 solar , and the absence of a significant underlying old population . however , whether this is a signature of youth remains a subject of debate ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the optical structure of this galaxy is very rich , including the two ( southeast and northwest ) central bright knots within the main body @xcite . iizw70 and iizw71 are two prototypical hii galaxies that are interacting .",
    "iizw70 presents a conspicuous central star - forming region , and extending to the north - west and south - west there appear fan - like extensions , resembling jet structures @xcite .",
    "iizw71 shows a chain of individual star - forming knots that crosses the whole optical body of the galaxy and accounts for all the h@xmath2 emission .",
    "two - dimensional spectra have been analyzed in order to derive the properties of the different components of the galaxy iizw70 , that was observed with pmas at caha .",
    "the pmas spectrograph is equipped with 256 fibers coupled to a @xmath3 lens array .",
    "each fiber has a spatial sampling of 0 @xmath45@xmath50 @xmath45 on the sky resulting in a field of view of @xmath6 .",
    "mosaic patterns were used to cover the central regions and different regions of interest ( e.g. , tidal tails ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the software r3d @xcite .",
    "we fitted the line profiles to derive the integrated flux of each emission line , using the software fit3d @xcite , already used in previous similar studies @xcite,@xcite .    in figure",
    "[ maps ] we show maps of iizw70 in the flux for the lines h@xmath2@xmath06563   and [ oiii]@xmath05007  . the original pixels have been resampled in order to smooth the emission features .",
    "emission line images are created by selecting appropriate narrow band filters from the data cube .",
    "these narrow band images are created in a wavelength range of @xmath710   around the emission wavelength and show emission line fluxes not corrected by reddening .",
    "the continuum emission is subtracted using narrow - band images in wavelengths adjacent to the emission lines .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the diagnostic diagrams , [ oiii]@xmath05007/h@xmath8 vs. [ sii]@xmath96717,31/h@xmath2 and [ oiii]@xmath95007/h@xmath8 vs. [ nii]@xmath96584/h@xmath2 @xcite , only for the fibers that present diagnostic line - intensity ratios with relative errors @xmath10 30@xmath11 .",
    "line fluxes were corrected for interstellar extinction using the value of c(h@xmath12 ) for each fiber , applying the extinction law given by @xcite .",
    "the solid lines show the classical separation between ionization due to star formation ( left ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( right ) .",
    "the boundary curve between agns and star forming regions is taken from @xcite .",
    "@xmath05007/h@xmath12 and [ sii]@xmath0@xmath06717,31/h@xmath2 and right panel displays [ oiii]@xmath05007/h@xmath12 line ratio as a function of [ nii]@xmath06584/h@xmath2 ; only line ratios with relative errors @xmath10 30@xmath11 are shown ; the solid lines are the dividing lines between hii - regions galaxies ( left ) and agns ( right ) @xcite.,width=302 ]    the diagnostic diagrams give us information about the nature of the ionizing source .",
    "we can see that most of line - intensity ratios measured for each fiber , at both diagrams , are located on the left side of the solid curves .",
    "this suggests that for the galaxy iizw70 the ionising radiation is mainly related to the most massive youngest stars .",
    "we would like to stress that spectrophotometric studies of hii galaxies are of paramount importance in order to derive their evolutionary status . besides , high - resolution spectroscopy of hii galaxies will help trace the kinematics of the galaxy and provide valuable information on the mechanisms triggering the star formation .",
    "a detailed analysis of these data is going to be presented in a forthcoming paper ."
