    "recent developments involving imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) have revolutionised the field of very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath1-ray  astronomy .",
    "indeed , observational data obtained using the current generation of stereoscopic arrays have contributed over 100 new sources to the catalogue of confirmed gev - tev emitters .",
    "notwithstanding these impressive achievements , the motivation for astronomers to continue identifying and categorising additional @xmath1-ray  sources and source populations remains undiminished .",
    "the initial source detections are likely to be dominated by luminous or nearby @xmath1-ray  emitters , implying a requirement for subsequent observations to target progressively fainter source populations .",
    "accordingly , the development of analytical techniques which enable maximal exploitation of the available instrumental sensitivity will become increasingly important as the life - cycles of the various iact arrays unfold .",
    "this emerging philosophy is exemplified by the recent work of @xcite which employs accurate knowledge of the instrumental response to enhance the performance and reliability of an established technique for source detection originally developed by @xcite .    until recently",
    ", the inherent faintness of astrophysical vhe @xmath1-ray  fluxes has resulted in statistically limited signal measurements with uncertainties that are dominated by poissonian shot noise . accordingly",
    ", many traditional iact analyses have justifiably neglected the existence of previously sub - dominant systematic effects .",
    "in contrast , successful source detection at the limits of instrumental sensitivity requires deep observations and the accumulation of rich data sets with abundant event statistics . in this new regime , the relative contribution of statistical fluctuations to the overall error budget is suppressed with measurement accuracy ultimately becoming systematically limited .",
    "this work investigates methods for the appropriate statistical treatment of systematic uncertainties affecting iact observational data and their subsequent analysis . in cherenkov astronomy ,",
    "the synthesis of large data sets typically involves aggregation of temporally sparse event statistics which correspond to distinct values of various observational parameters , each of which can introduce distinct , observation - specific systematic biases .",
    "accordingly , analyses that are designed to ameliorate the impact of irreducible systematic effects must incorporate sufficient flexibility to successfully model this inter - observational variability .    in the subsequent discussion , the relevant statistical issues and the techniques designed to address them are illustrated using the specific example of _ stacking _ analysis .",
    "in such analyses , measurement data that correspond to multiple , independent but similar experiments are combined to enhance their scientific utility . in the context of @xmath1-ray  astronomy ,",
    "stacking analyses are commonly applied in situations when a target population comprises a large number of individually undetectable source candidates that are theoretically expected to exhibit at least one identical signal characteristic . in the absence of genuine @xmath1-ray  emission",
    ", the superimposed observational data will be consistent with random poisson fluctuations about the mean background level .",
    "conversely , multiple faint signals produced by a genuine sample of faint @xmath1-ray  sources will reinforce upon combination , yielding a significant overall excess with respect to the measured background . accordingly , stacking analyses often facilitate the derivation of average source properties for the target population as a whole , even when detection of individual @xmath1-ray  signals is rendered impossible by inadequate instrumental sensitivity . the specific consideration of stacking is instructive because combined source analysis inherently segregates subsets of observational data which are likely to incorporate distinct systematic biases .",
    "moreover , stacking analyses provide a more intuitive distinction between systematic effects that undergo temporal variation , such as telescope elevation or optical efficiency , and those that vary on a target - wise basis , such as the ambient night - sky brightness of the number of @xmath1-ray  sources within the telescope field - of - view .",
    "compelling and theoretically well motivated target populations for combined source analyses include x - ray binary systems @xcite , combined pulsar populations within globular clusters and the self - annihilating dark matter components of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the atmosphere of the earth is almost completely opaque to multi - gev and tev radiation and accordingly , the operational mode of iact arrays relies upon indirect detection of astrophysical @xmath1-rays .",
    "indeed , the majority of incident vhe photons undergo electron - positron pair production interactions within the coulomb fields of stratospheric nuclei .",
    "frequently , these interactions initiate electromagnetic cascades of charged particles , which radiate cherenkov light as they descend superluminally through the dielectric medium of the atmosphere .",
    "iact arrays are designed to image the resultant distribution of cherenkov photons at ground - level , using the encoded information to reconstruct the properties of the progenitor @xmath1-ray .",
    "the set of reconstructed @xmath1-ray  properties define a multi - dimensional parameter space , with suitable sub - spaces that define the event populations that are required for specific astrophysical analyses .",
    "the situation is complicated somewhat by the fact that iact arrays operate in a strongly background dominated regime and must successfully distinguish a comparatively weak @xmath1-ray  signal from an almost overwhelming background of air - showers initiated by hadronic cosmic rays .",
    "fortunately , the properties of hadron- and @xmath1-ray - initiated air - showers are sufficiently disparate that an effective segregation is possible based on the characteristics of the captured cherenkov images .",
    "traditionally , a simplified elliptical parameterisation of the cherenkov light distribution was used in conjunction with lookup tables of simulated air - shower properties to separate the signal and background event populations @xcite .",
    "modern computational resources permit utilisation of the complete cherenkov images ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the application of advanced machine - learning algorithms ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to further enhance the background rejection efficiency .",
    "despite these sophisticated filtering techniques , the sheer number of air - showers that trigger an iact array during a given observation inevitably results in a subset of hadron - originated cherenkov images which are sufficiently @xmath1-ray - like in appearance to survive the event selection procedure .",
    "quantitatively , the probability that a @xmath1-ray - like event having specific reconstructed parameters will pass background rejection is described by a multi - dimensional _ acceptance _ function .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath1-ray  signal ( @xmath2 ) within a suitably defined sampling region of the event property parameter space is a superposition of the true @xmath1-ray  signal ( @xmath3 ) on an irreducible background ( @xmath4 ) of spuriously classified events . @xmath5",
    "the magnitude of the background component is typically estimated using the number of @xmath1-ray - like events ( @xmath6 ) that are reconstructed within one or more nominally off - source regions . adopting this convention ,",
    "is normally re - expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath0 is a normalisation factor which compensates for any disparities in the instrumental response among the various sampling regions .",
    "fundamentally , the precise value of @xmath0 is dependent upon specific characteristics of the individual observations that contribute to the overall data set .",
    "numerous variable factors such as the target zenith and azimuthal angles , the configuration and functionality of individual telescopes within a larger array , or the ambient atmospheric conditions may modify the nominal system performance .",
    "the functional dependency of @xmath0 on the various observational and instrumental parameters is complicated and is must typically be resolved for each observation using a multi - dimensional model estimate of the prevailing system acceptance .",
    "candidate models may be synthesised by interpolating the distributions of representative @xmath1-ray - like background data sets , assembled from multiple independent observations of empty fields - of - view .",
    "accurate replication of the true system acceptance using this technique requires an extensive database of suitable observations with characteristics that sample the entire space of observational parameters with adequate resolution . for certain well - understood parameters it may be possible to derive semi - analytic parameterisations of the corresponding systematic distortions , which can improve the interpolation accuracy and reduce the required sampling density",
    "nonetheless , for complicated instruments with a large number of possible configurations , the observation time required to populate the reference database may be prohibitive .",
    "alternatively , response models which inherently incorporate the appropriate systematic offsets can be constructed on an observation - wise basis using the subset of @xmath1-ray - like background events that fall outside of the fiducial sampling regions . however , this approach is susceptible to contamination by imperfectly excluded @xmath1-ray  sources and is ultimately limited by the availability of event statistics within a single field - of - view .    for the current generation of iacts ,",
    "residual discrepancies between the generated model and the true instrumental response reflect a superposition of imperfectly modelled systematic offsets and are typically at the few percent level .",
    "however , if observational situations arise in which both approaches for modelling the system acceptance are compromised , the resultant disparity could be much larger .",
    "for example , if the telescope configuration or the prevailing operating conditions restrict the availability of appropriate archival background data and the target field - of - view is crowded , then systematic effects could dominate statistical uncertainties when searching for faint @xmath1-ray  sources .",
    "moreover , since the combined impact of multiple systematic effects is often reflected by _ non - uniform _ variations in the system acceptance , the relative extent and location of the sampling regions within the event property parameter space may also bias the estimated value of @xmath0 .",
    "most experiments tacitly acknowledge the uncertainty in @xmath0 by attaching a conservative systematic error term to their quoted results .",
    "conventional stacking analyses typically entail simple summation of the observed event counts associated with the individual targets in the population sample , with the aggregate datasets forming the basis for subsequent astrophysical inference .",
    "however , the background estimation procedures outlined in @xmath8[subsec : obs_technique ] render this traditional approach ( hereafter referred to as _",
    "data stacking _ ) sub - optimal in the context of vhe @xmath1-ray  observations . in particular , data stacking analyses are complicated somewhat by the requirement to synthesise a combined value of the normalisation parameter @xmath9 which corresponds to the stacked dataset .",
    "a viable approach uses the definition of the overall signal excess , @xmath10 to form an average over all @xmath11 targets in the sample , weighted by the individual off - source counts .",
    "@xmath12 unfortunately , this technique fails to account for any target - specific uncertainties that arise during derivation of the individual @xmath13 .",
    "even if no systematic _ biases _ are introduced , the diverse observational parameters that correspond to each individual target dataset will likely affect accuracy to which the corresponding values of @xmath13 can be determined .",
    "the resultant non - uniformity renders subsequent propagation of the individual error estimates to the value of @xmath9 somewhat problematic for the data stacking approach .",
    "indeed , it is often unclear how the individual uncertainties should be combined in a statistically consistent manner , particularly when they are characterised by asymmetric intervals or more complicated probability distributions .",
    "assignment of a uniform but conservative systematic error term to all of the @xmath13 renders the problem tractable , but inevitably results in an overall loss of sensitivity .",
    "moreover , indications exist that the shortcomings of the data stacking technique can be problematic in experimental situations .",
    "indeed , @xcite derived anomalously high combined significance results when applying a data stacking procedure to two independent target ensembles comprising 37 and 44 putative vhe @xmath1-ray sources for which @xmath14 and @xmath15 . by studying the on and off - source event count distributions ,",
    "@xcite concluded that a relative target - wise dispersion @xmath16 was required to explain the derived significances in the absence of a true @xmath1-ray  signal .    in subsequent sections ,",
    "the statistical behaviour of the data stacking approach is investigated , highlighting the limited applicability of this technique in scenarios for which @xmath0 is uncertain . in response to these inherent shortcomings , a statistically robust method for the combination of iact observations",
    "is outlined , which allows systematic uncertainties to be treated on a target - by - target basis . using this technique ,",
    "observations yielding weakly constrained values of @xmath13 may be usefully and consistently combined with more reliable datasets , without diluting the scientific utility of the latter .",
    "the new method operates by defining target - specific likelihood functions which facilitate appropriate treatment of relevant systematic uncertainties . stacking is implemented by forming a product of individual target likelihood functions and using this combined likelihood to estimate the shared characteristics of the putative @xmath1-ray  signals .",
    "it should be emphasised that the applicability of the method is contingent upon an implicit assumption of at least one identical signal characteristic for all targets comprising the sample . realistically ,",
    "signal characteristics for which the required assumption of universality is reasonable are typically target - specific functions of the experimental observables . as discussed in the subsequent paragraphs , disparities between putative sub - populations comprising the target sample are inherently problematic in the context of data stacking . in contrast",
    ", the suggested approach intrinsically facilitates straightforward customisation of the individual target likelihoods .",
    "construction of the single target likelihood function proceeds under the assumption that the sample of @xmath1-ray - like events that are reconstructed within a nominal sampling region is drawn from a parent population with poisson distributed arrival times .",
    "accordingly , if the value of @xmath0 were precisely constrained , then would imply @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denotes the true mean value of the poisson distributed variables @xmath2 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the new parameter @xmath20 represents the unknown , true value of the derived normalisation parameter .",
    "in fact , the assumed validity of is implicit in the derivation of @xmath9 in with likely deviations from this idealised behaviour undermining the reliability of the traditional data stacking framework .",
    "conversely , the combined likelihood approach treats target - specific systematic uncertainties by modelling @xmath0 as a random variable with arbitrary distribution @xmath21 . as indicated in @xmath8[subsec : obs_technique ] , the specific functional definitions of @xmath21 are dependent upon observational parameters which are likely to vary on a target - by - target basis .",
    "the probability density function which models an abstract single - target dataset @xmath22 is simply the product of the distributions of its component data .",
    "@xmath23 accordingly , substitution for @xmath24 using a concrete observational dataset @xmath25 enables calculation of the target - specific likelihood describing the true @xmath1-ray  signal . @xmath26",
    "modelling systematically uncertain parameters as random variables with known probability density functions is a common statistical approach , with applications extending beyond the limited domain of stacking analyses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , equations and are equally valid in single target iact analyses that must accommodate non - negligible systematic uncertainties on the estimated value of @xmath0 .",
    "the ultimate goal of this stacking procedure is to obtain improved constraints on the global @xmath1-ray  signal characteristics . in this context , @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "are not of primary interest and are therefore categorised as nuisance parameters throughout the subsequent analysis .    finally , the joint likelihood describing the global signal characteristics of the entire ensemble of @xmath11 targets is simply the product of the individual target likelihoods .",
    "@xmath27 accordingly , the set of values which parameterise @xmath28 is the union of the parameters of the component single - target likelihood functions and therefore incorporates @xmath29 uncertain nuisance parameters .",
    "the initial objective of a stacking analysis is typically the conclusive detection of a combined @xmath1-ray  excess , with detailed investigation of specific signal characteristics assuming subsidiary importance . in such situations ,",
    "the probability of detection is typically evaluated in terms of the the significance , @xmath30 with which experimental data exclude the null hypothesis of zero signal .    for an abstract likelihood function",
    "@xmath31 relating the experimental data @xmath32 to multiple nuisance parameters , @xmath33 and parameters of interest @xmath34 , a popular formula for calculation of detection significance @xcite employs the likelihood ratio defined by @xcite @xmath35 where a caret denotes the maximum likelihood estimate of the accented symbol , @xmath36 denotes the value of @xmath37 which corresponds to the null hypothesis , and @xmath38 represents the conditional maximum likelihood estimate for @xmath39 given that @xmath40 .",

    "proponents of data stacking typically emulate the single - target approach by using equation 17 in conjunction with a pseudo - dataset @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , non - uniform observational dependencies the individual @xmath13 become entangled , which inevitably complicates statistically robust treatment of their effects .",
    "conversely , direct substitution of @xmath46 in the calculation of @xmath47 in the joint - likelihood approach ensures that the resultant expression for @xmath30 is constructed using all available information regarding target - specific systematic uncertainties .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed an extension to the method suggested by @xcite which uses well - calibrated estimates of the instrumental point - spread function to achieve enhanced sensitivity relative to the more traditional analysis .",
    "their technique ameliorates the effect of systematic variations in the telescope acceptance characteristics by segregating the observational data on the basis of prevailing instrumental and environmental parameters .",
    "results that are derived from a joint likelihood stacking analysis comprise estimates of the various experimental parameters of interest , with any uncertainty quantified using associated confidence intervals .",
    "the frequentist definition of a properly constructed @xmath48 confidence interval states that @xmath48 of such intervals , generated from a large number of independent experimental measurements of a quantity @xmath49 , will contain ( or _ cover _ ) the true value @xmath50 .",

    "moreover , the inherent permissivity of derived confidence intervals is compounded by the inclusion of additional targets . in combination , these characteristics imply a substantially increased tendency to generate spurious results which is exacerbated as the stacked target ensemble is enlarged . in an experimental context",
    ", this behaviour would be highly undesirable and largely undermines the motivation for combined source analysis .",
    "in contrast , confidence intervals provided by the joint likelihood approach closely approximate correct coverage under the assumption of symmetric uncertainties on @xmath0 , and exhibit multiplicity - dependent under - coverage at @xmath97 levels if an asymmetric distribution is adopted .",
    "the deviations from correct coverage that are exhibited by the data stacking approach are consistent with the erroneous assumption of negligible uncertainty in the value of @xmath0 .",

    "appropriate interpretation of the combined signal significance is also more complicated within the data stacking framework .",

    "the situation deteriorates when increasingly asymmetric parameterisations of the generated @xmath0 distribution are adopted . under these circumstances ,",

    "in contrast , significance estimates derived for @xmath77 using the joint likelihood approach appear insensitive to the value of @xmath11 and display excellent correspondence with the expected @xmath44 distribution .    notwithstanding appropriate calibration of a suitable detection threshold @xmath87 ,",
    "the powers which characterise the data stacking technique indicate that asymmetry in the adopted @xmath0 distribution substantially diminishes the overall sensitivity .",
    "conversely , the powers corresponding to the joint likelihood analysis appear relatively unaffected by the choice of @xmath21 .",
    "the alternative approaches exhibit similar properties , and indeed data stacking appears to marginally outperform the joint likelihood approach , if symmetric systematic uncertainties are assumed .",
    "it should be acknowledged that the degree of adverse behaviour inherent in the data stacking technique is contingent upon the adopted values of @xmath20 and @xmath19 , as well as the assumed magnitude of the simulated systematic effects .",

    "the curves correspond to simulated ensembles comprising @xmath100 target sources for which @xmath101 and @xmath102 . despite an inevitable reduction in the influence of the modelled systematic offsets ,",
    "it is clear that even small target - specific biasses can reinforce to distort the combined significance for large observational datasets .",
    "moreover , even the pessimistic parameter values that define models a and b may be practically relevant , especially when the extent of off - source regions is restricted by nearby sources , or stringent event selection limits the overall count statistics .     for the and data stacking approach .",

    "nonetheless , it should be stated that the _ full _ potential of the joint likelihood method can only be realised if the distributions of all the systematic uncertainties affect each observational dataset are parameterisable with sufficient accuracy .    admittedly , definitive derivation of the distribution of @xmath0 is unlikely to be straightforward in many situations",
    ". semi - analytic estimation of the required distributions necessitates detailed knowledge of the instrumental response as well as careful measurement of the environmental conditions at the time of observation .",
    "accordingly , imperfect or incomplete understanding of the dominant systematic biases might render this approach untenable .",
    "plausible alternative strategies include jackknife or bootstrap resampling of off - source data from randomly selected background sampling regions to derive multiple estimates for @xmath0 and construct an empirical distribution . in this case , the accuracy of the resultant parameterisation is limited by the finite number of permutations available for the resampling process . emulating the approach of @xcite and segregating data on the basis of quantifiable _ operating conditions _ would enable the use of large representative datasets to derive template distributions that pertain to finite subsets of the observational parameter space .    in situations where the suggested techniques are unable to accurately reconstruct the shape of the @xmath0 distribution , a generic parameterisation",
    "could be tailored using target - specific estimates of the dispersion in derived values of the on / off normalisation . by acknowledging the existence of the associated systematic uncertainties , this first - order approximation would ameliorate under - coverage as well as deviations from the nominal @xmath44 distribution for @xmath30 , thereby reducing the rate of unexpected false - positive detections",
    "moreover , by facilitating limited adaptation of the modelled systematic uncertainties , this approach retains a key advantage of the full joint likelihood technique that can not be straightforwardly emulated by traditional data stacking .",
    "indeed , it is likely that this simplified approach might recover a significant proportion of the power which is achieved when the true distribution of @xmath0 is available",
    ". nonetheless , as demonstrated by the monte carlo results for a symmetric distribution of @xmath0 , there may be situations in which the advantages offered by the joint likelihood approach are marginal and the performance of the data stacking approach is deemed sufficient .",
    "while this study has focussed upon parameterisation of @xmath0 uncertainties , the joint likelihood technique represents a highly flexible and extensible analytical approach .",
    "indeed , related analyses are able to parameterise arbitrary properties of the instrument response , the measured @xmath1-ray signal , and even suspected source properties such as the spectral index and temporal variability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "toy monte carlo simulations have been used to investigate the effect of non - negligible systematic uncertainties affecting the relative normalisation of the on and off - source event sampling regions in atmospheric cherenkov telescope observations . as a specific example , the properties of two alternative strategies for combined source analysis have been examined .",
    "situations have been identified in which the traditional _ data stacking _ approach exhibits unexpected and undesirable statistical behaviour . even when correctly calibrated null distributions for the combined significance are employed , the sensitivity of the data stacking approach appears markedly impaired if asymmetrically distributed @xmath0 uncertainties are assumed . the data stacking technique is also yields unreliable estimates for the @xmath1-ray  signal parameters , with derived confidence intervals deviate from their stated coverage by a margin which widens with increasing target multiplicity .",
    "an alternative to data stacking has been outlined which combines target - specific likelihood functions that explicitly account for non - uniform systematic uncertainties . as an analytical approach ,",
    "the _ joint likelihood _",
    "technique exhibits many characteristics which surpass those of traditional data stacking .",
    "it offers a statistically robust prescription for the treatment of target - specific systematic uncertainties , and effectively addresses the shortcomings which are inherent in the data stacking framework .",
    "indeed , the joint likelihood effectively eliminates pathological behaviour inherent in data stacking , with combined source significances conforming to a single , nominal null distribution .",
    "moreover , it achieves equivalent or superior sensitivity to the data stacking technique and yields parameter confidence intervals that exhibit minimal deviation from their stated coverage .",
    "many of the insights provided by this study of combined source analyses are equally applicable to single - target analyses involving similarly abundant event statistics",
    ". indeed , the synthesis of any extensive dataset often combines observations which incorporate diverse systematic effects .",
    "this study has shown that the joint likelihood method provides a viable approach for the robust combination of data with inhomogeneous systematic uncertainties , irrespective of the celestial target coordinates .",

    "<S> in response to an increasing availability of statistically rich observational data sets , the performance and applicability of traditional atmospheric cherenkov telescope analyses in the regime of systematically dominated measurement uncertainties is examined . in particular , the effect of systematic uncertainties affecting the relative normalisation of fiducial on and off - source sampling regions - often denoted as @xmath0 - is investigated using combined source analysis as a representative example case . </S>",
    "<S> the traditional summation of accumulated on and off - source event counts is found to perform sub - optimally in the studied contexts and requires careful calibration to correct for unexpected and potentially misleading statistical behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , failure to recognise and correct for erroneous estimates of @xmath0 is found to produce substantial overestimates of the combined population significance which worsen with increasing target multiplicity . an alternative _ joint likelihood _ </S>",
    "<S> technique is introduced , which is designed to treat systematic uncertainties in a uniform and statistically robust manner . </S>",
    "<S> this alternate method is shown to yield dramatically enhanced performance and reliability with respect to the more traditional approach .    </S>",
