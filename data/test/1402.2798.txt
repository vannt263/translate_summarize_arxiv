    "turbulence in rayleigh - bnard ( rb ) convection  @xcite has been studied extensively over the last three decades .",
    "there have been two primary objectives : + ( a ) to get a firm grasp on how the nusselt number ( @xmath16 ) scales with the rayleigh number ( @xmath17 )  @xcite and + ( b ) to understand the issues pertaining to energy and entropy spectra and fluxes  @xcite .",
    "+ in the former  [ i.e. , ( a ) ] the interest has centered on the scaling of @xmath16 with @xmath17 for very high values of @xmath17  @xcite and on understanding the boundary layers which are responsible for the scaling and statistics of the temperature fluctuations .",
    "the study of rb convection under rotation started attracting a good deal of attention from the eighties and the effect of rotation on the nusselt number has been repeatedly studied  @xcite .    in the latter [ i.e. , ( b ) ]",
    "the interest has centered on whether the energy and entropy spectra will be determined by the kolmogorov ( k41 )  @xcite or the bolgiano - obukhov ( bo ) scaling  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that there exists a crossover length @xmath18 ( bolgiano length ) with corresponding wave number @xmath19 such that for wave number @xmath20 the energy spectrum is k41 ( @xmath21 ) and for @xmath22 it is bo ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "while the outcomes of different experiments  @xcite are at best contentious , the numerical simulations  @xcite show a scaling behavior which holds for much less than one decade of wave numbers .",
    "the effect of rotation on the energy and entropy spectra has never been considered .",
    "a re - examination of the k41 result for the rb convection with rotation ( sec . iv of this paper ) showed that even for @xmath20 one is not assured of kolmogorov scaling .",
    "one has a lower limit @xmath24 and pure k41 can only be observed in the range @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , one finds that there exists a wave number @xmath26 which limits the applicability of pure bo scaling to the range @xmath27 .",
    "these restrictions are rather severe .",
    "the arguments indicate that one could at best expect an effective exponent .",
    "we decided to repeat the numerical simulations and try a scaling plot with no bias towards k41 or bo exponents . to our surprise",
    "the exponent that provided the best fit to the energy was @xmath28 .",
    "the error bars are small enough in most of the runs to rule out @xmath29 .",
    "the k41 answer of @xmath29 for the scaling exponent  @xcite relies on the fact that the sweeping of small eddies by large eddies is ignored , which is not a real part of turbulent motion .",
    "it is well known that the energy spectrum behaves as @xmath30 , if the dynamics is sweeping dominated .",
    "straightforward arguments show that the scaling exponent would be @xmath31 for the sweeping dominated bo regime .",
    "hence it is clear that the numerical results presented in sec .",
    "iii support a sweeping dominated kolmogorov regime . with this background",
    ", we decided to investigate the crossover between k41 and bo regimes by considering the rayleigh - bnard system under rotation .",
    "it should be possible to suppress the velocity fluctuations and give greater prominence to the thermal fluctuations in the rotation dominated regime , which in turn would be responsible for engineering a passage to the bo spectrum .",
    "since the study of the spectrum for the rb turbulence has never been carried out for the rotating system , this could open up new possibilities .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]         for a rb system , the dynamics is controlled by two dimensionless numbers : the rayleigh number @xmath17 and the prandtl number @xmath32 .",
    "the rayleigh number is defined as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the temperature difference between the bottom and top horizontal plates , which are separated by a distance @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath37 the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath38 and @xmath39 the kinematic viscosity and the thermal diffusivity respectively .",
    "the prandtl number @xmath40 is the ratio of the thermal diffusion time scale to the momentum diffusion time scale .",
    "convection sets in as @xmath17 is raised above a critical value @xmath41 , which is @xmath42 for _ stress - free _ boundaries and",
    "1708 for _ no - slip _ boundaries .",
    "the threshold is independent of @xmath32 .",
    "convective turbulence occurs for @xmath43 .",
    "it is convenient to describe turbulence in terms of the reduced rayleigh number @xmath44 .",
    "the convection appears at @xmath45 , and the convective flow becomes turbulent for @xmath46 .",
    "there is another dimensionless number in the presence of uniform rotation about a vertical axis : the taylor number @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the rotation frequency .",
    "the threshold is now strongly dependent on @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath49 the onset of convection is always stationary for all values of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the threshold of kppers - lortz instability .",
    "the threshold for stationary convection @xmath52 is proportional to @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath55 , the onset is oscillatory and the threshold @xmath56 depends on @xmath10 as well as @xmath32 . for very small values of @xmath32 , the oscillatory threshold @xmath57 is proportional to @xmath58 as @xmath59 .",
    "the importance of the effect of rotation can be determined from another dimensionless parameter which is expressed as @xmath60 and is called the rossby number .",
    "generally a rossby number smaller than unity or closer to unity corresponds to the dominance of rotation .",
    "it is important to discuss the known results about the nusselt number investigations in both non rotating  @xcite and rotating  @xcite systems .",
    "the nusselt number , unlike the spectrum , has been studied extensively and as we shall see has some bearing on our findings about the spectrum .",
    "it is established that in the non rotating systems , the nusselt number follows a slightly modified power law . in the early work of castaing et al .",
    "@xcite , physical arguments and experimental data were presented to support a simple power law @xmath61 . a decade later niemela et al .",
    "@xcite suggested an exponent of 0.3 with a logarithimic correction and grossmann and lohse  @xcite proposed a sum of two terms with exponents @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the later proposals were refinements on the original proposal of castaing et al .",
    "@xcite which , in the range of rayleigh numbers that we will be discussing , is an adequate representation .",
    "this form of @xmath16 vs @xmath17 curves were found to be true for a wide range of prandtl numbers .",
    "the effect of rotation on the nusselt number has also been studied extensively as noted earlier but it is only lately that the effect of rotation has been cast in a particularly useful form . beginning with the work of king et al .",
    "@xcite , we see that at a given rotation speed , the nusselt number follows the curve for the non - rotating situation for high rayleigh numbers ( see also ,  @xcite ) and as the rayleigh number is lowered , the nusselt number falls below the non rotating value at a particular value of ra which we call @xmath64 .",
    "as the rotation speed is changed the value of @xmath64 changes - decreasing as the rotation speed decreases .",
    "this is a common feature of all the data taken at different prandtl numbers and taylor numbers .",
    "we decided to check whether there is a systematic way of characterizing @xmath65 .",
    "we found that if the threshold of convection is @xmath66 , then the ratio @xmath67 depend on @xmath32 and @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath68 is approximately @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 . for a given rotation rate , @xmath68 is lower for higher values of @xmath32 .",

    "iii are carried out for a wide range of dimensionless parameters on @xmath72 and @xmath73 grids .",
    "the taylor number is varied in the range @xmath1 .",
    "the onset of convection is always oscillatory for the values of @xmath32 and @xmath10 considered here . the reduced rayleigh number is therefore defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath74 is the threshold value for the onset of oscillatory convection .",
