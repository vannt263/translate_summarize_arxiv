    "when a system experiences a sufficiently large , sudden change of an external parameter , referred to as a quench , the current state of the system will lose stability and a transition will occur to a new state . when there is more than one possibility for the new state ( such as spin up or down in a magnetic system ) , domains will form . at late times , these domains coarsen , or grow .",
    "the dynamics of this coarsening process has been the subject of substantial research and is important in many applications @xcite . in general , the domains are characterized by a single length scale , @xmath0 , that grows according to a power - law , @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is referred to as the _ growth exponent_. this process is usually referred to as _ domain coarsening_. some examples of systems for which domain coarsening has been studied in detail @xcite , either theoretically or experimentally , include the ising model , binary fluids , liquid crystals , diblock copolymers @xcite , and electroconvection @xcite .",
    "there are a number of ways to categorize systems undergoing coarsening .",
    "first , one must distinguish between cases where the order parameter is conserved , such as in a binary fluid , and where it is not conserved , such as in the ising model .",
    "second , the domains that are growing may be uniform , such as in both the ising model and binary fluids , or they may consist of a pattern , such as stripes in the case of diblock copolymers and electroconvection . finally , the initial and final states can either be thermodynamic equilibrium states or steady states of the system .",
    "most of the studies have focused on the case where the initial state prior to the quench and the final state well after the quench are thermodynamic equilibrium states @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this type of system as a _",
    "thermodynamic system_. for isotropic , thermodynamic systems , where the domains are uniform , the exponents are well known . for systems with a non - conserved order parameter , @xmath3 .",
    "systems with a conserved order parameter have @xmath4 . in this report , we focus on coarsening in a system in which the domains are composed of stripes",
    ". an added feature of the system we consider is that the initial and final states are _ not _ states of thermodynamic equilibrium , though they are steady - states of the system .",
    "we refer to this as a driven system .    for systems in which the domains are composed of stripes , theoretical studies of the power - law scaling of the late - time domain growth has focused on simulations and analysis of the swift - hohenberg equation @xcite .",
    "experiments have been performed in both a thermodynamic system , diblock copolymers @xcite , and a driven system , electroconvection @xcite .",
    "this work has raised two related issues .",
    "first , two length scales are important in the problem : the wavelength of the pattern and the scale of a domain .",
    "this has an interesting impact on the measured growth exponents .",
    "traditional studies of domain growth focus on the structure factor , @xmath5 .",
    "this measures both variations in wavenumber and domain size , with information about both lengths scales mixing in a nontrivial way . for striped systems",
    ", one can also consider orientational correlation functions , defect densities , or domain wall lengths .",
    "these quantities are independent of the local wavenumber and are expected to provide information about domain size only .",
    "numerical simulations have considered both the scaling of the structure factor , @xmath5 , of the system and the orientational correlation function .",
    "the evolution of the structure factor is found to be consistent with a length scale that grows as @xmath6 for both potential and nonpotential versions of the swift - hohenberg equation @xcite . however , the growth exponent determined from the orientational correlation function is @xmath7 for the potential case and @xmath8 for the nonpotential case @xcite .",
    "the orientational correlation function and defect densities are measured experimentally in diblock copolymers @xcite .",
    "the results agree with the potential case of the swift - hohenberg model , @xmath9 . for a particular case of electroconvection",
    ", it was shown that the wavenumber and domains evolve differently @xcite .",
    "it was found that the growth exponent measured using @xmath5 is consistent with @xmath10 and measurement of the domain size gave @xmath9 .",
    "this is in agreement with simulations for the potential case @xcite .",
    "in addition , the distribution of local wavenumbers was measured separately .",
    "this distribution was essentially independent of time , providing an explanation for the difference between @xmath5 and domain wall measurements .",
    "the second issue associated with striped domains is the interaction between defects in the pattern and the background stripe pattern .",
    "this has been studied using the swift - hohenberg equation .",
    "one important consequence is that the growth of domains can be strongly affected by pinning of grain boundaries @xcite . in these simulations ,",
    "the measured growth exponents depends on the depth of the quench , something that does not occur in uniform systems .",
    "the growth exponents are also found to depend on the level of noise in the system @xcite .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that noise can provide a source of `` depinning '' for the defects .",
    "finally , the evolution of the average wavenumber provides a possible explanation for differences in simulations of the potential and nonpotential versions of the swift - hohenberg equations .",
    "the average wavenumber in each case evolves to different values , and this was suggested as one possible explanation for the two different growth exponents @xcite .",
    "we report on an experimental study of the impact of changes in the average wavenumber on the growth of domains .",
    "we utilize a particular example of electroconvection that is ideally suited for controlling the average wavenumber of the pattern : electroconvection in the nematic liquid crystal i52 @xcite .",
    "a nematic liquid crystal is a fluid in which the molecules are aligned on average @xcite . the axis along which the average alignment points is referred to as the director . for electroconvection @xcite",
    ", a nematic liquid crystal is placed between two glass plates that have been treated so that the director is everywhere parallel to the plates .",
    "an ac voltage is applied perpendicular to the plates . above a critical value of the voltage , a pattern of stripes forms . because the system is anisotropic ( the director selects a preferred axis ) , the states are usually characterized by the angle between the wavevector of the pattern and the undistorted director , @xmath11 .",
    "states with the same wavenumber and angle @xmath12 are degenerate and referred to as zig and zag , respectively . for the system discussed in this paper ,",
    "the initial pattern consists of four travelling stripe states @xcite : right- and left - travelling zig and zag rolls .",
    "it has been established for this system that above a critical value for a modulation of the applied voltage at twice the travelling frequency , the system consists of either standing zig or zag rolls @xcite .",
    "therefore , a sudden quench of the system from below this critical value to above it results in the nucleation of domains of standing zig and zag rolls , which proceed to coarsen .",
    "previous measurements of growth exponents for this system focused on quenches that used exactly twice the travelling frequency .",
    "reference  @xcite reports a value of @xmath9 for the growth of the domain size and @xmath10 for the scaling of @xmath5 .",
    "a single initial experiment for a modulation frequency slightly different from twice the travelling frequency suggested similar behavior .",
    "however , a systematic exploration of changes in the wavenumber , by varying the modulation frequency , is possible for this system @xcite , and has not been carried out . in this paper , we report on such a study .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii provides the details of the experimental system and the techniques used to analyze the domain growth .",
    "section iii presents the results of the experiment .",
    "section iv provides a discussion of the results .",
    "we used the liquid crystal i52 @xcite doped with iodine . due to the nature of i52 , @xmath13 iodine by weight",
    "was used initially . however , a significant fraction of the iodine evaporates before the cells are filled , so the final concentration is not well controlled .",
    "we used commercial liquid crystal cells @xcite composed of two transparent glass plates coated with a transparent conductor , indium - tin oxide .",
    "the cells were 2.54 cm x 2.54 cm , with the conductor forming a square 1 cm x 1 cm in the center of the cell .",
    "the glass was also treated with a rubbed polymer to obtain uniform planar alignment of the director .",
    "we define the direction parallel to the undistorted director to be the x axis and the direction perpendicular to the undistorted director to be the y axis .",
    "the apparatus is described in detail in ref .",
    "it consists of an aluminum block with glass windows .",
    "the temperature of the block was kept constant to @xmath14 .",
    "polarized light is applied from the bottom of the cell . above the cell",
    ", there is a ccd camera to capture the image of patterns using the standard shadowgraph technique @xcite .",
    "we apply an ac voltage of the form @xmath15cos(\\omega_d t)$ ] perpendicular to the glass plates . here",
    "@xmath16 is the amplitude of the applied voltage in the absence of modulation , @xmath17 is the modulation amplitude , @xmath18 is the modulation frequency , and @xmath19 is the driving frequency . for all of the experiments reported on here , @xmath20 . the critical voltage , @xmath21 is defined as the value of @xmath16 for which the system makes a transition from a uniform state to the superposition of travelling rolls _ in the absence of modulation_. there are two relevant control parameters : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    for the experiments discussed here , the system is initially at @xmath24 and @xmath25 , i.e. above onset with no modulation . as mentioned in sec .",
    "i , there are only four modes needed to describe the observed convection rolls : zig and zag , right and left travelling oblique rolls .",
    "this state is an example of spatiotemporal chaos in that the amplitude of the four modes varies irregularly in space and time @xcite . for each @xmath26 and @xmath18",
    ", there exists a critical value of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , above which the system consists of standing zig and zag rolls .",
    "a quench corresponds to a sudden change of @xmath27 to some value @xmath29 . at and below @xmath21 , the modulation frequency with the strongest coupling to the pattern , and correspondingly smallest value of @xmath28 ,",
    "is twice the hopf frequency , @xmath30 .",
    "the hopf frequency is the travelling wave frequency at @xmath21 .",
    "as one increases @xmath26 , the natural frequency of the pattern shifts . because we worked at a finite value of @xmath26 , the smallest value of @xmath28 occurs for a modulation frequency , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the natural frequency of the pattern at the given value of @xmath26 . because it is the relative shift in frequency that matters",
    ", we will consider the behavior as a function of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ onset ] is a plot of @xmath28 as a function of @xmath36 for @xmath24 .",
    "we focus almost exclusively on the negative values of @xmath36 because for @xmath37 , the pattern stabilized by modulation is standing waves that are a superposition of zig and zag rolls , and not individual domains of standing zig and zag rolls .",
    "quenches were performed for a range of @xmath36 .",
    "the final value of @xmath27 in each case was selected so that the quench depths all corresponded to @xmath38 , as measured from the onset of standing waves ( solid curve in fig .",
    "[ onset ] ) .",
    "the camera was triggered to take the images at the same point in the modulation cycle .",
    "this ensured that the pattern was imaged at the same point in the standing wave cycle .",
    "each image covered a region of @xmath39 of the cell .",
    "time is scaled by the director relaxation time , @xmath40 .",
    "here @xmath41 is a rotational viscosity ; @xmath42 is the splay elastic constant ; and @xmath43 is the thickness of the cell .",
    "an example of a small region of the pattern after a quench is given in fig .",
    "[ images ] . two different quenches are illustrated : @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the images for @xmath44 illustrate the type of patterns on which we focused : standing zig and zag rolls separated by domain walls .",
    "the domain walls are relatively `` thick '' , and the superposition of zig and zag rolls in a domain wall is visible .",
    "the quench at @xmath46 illustrates qualitatively different behavior . in this case",
    ", there are regions of superposition that are `` domains '' in their own right , though most of the regions of superposition can be considered to be domain walls .",
    "as we will show , this qualitative difference is apparent in various characterizations of the growth . as the focus of the paper is the impact of varying the wavenumber on the domain growth in the zig / zag system , we will only report on this single quench in the regime where domains of the superposition of zig and zag rolls occurs . further increasing @xmath47 results in patterns that are entirely the superposition of zig and zag rolls .",
    "future work will consider in more detail this other class of patterns .",
    "a number of features of the domains were analyzed .",
    "first , the power spectrum , @xmath5 , of each image was computed .",
    "this was used to determine the average wavenumber ( @xmath48 ) for the zig and zag rolls .",
    "the widths of the fundamental peak in @xmath5 in both the x ( @xmath49 ) and y ( @xmath50 ) directions were determined using the second moment of @xmath5 .",
    "this gives @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , and a similar definition for @xmath50 .",
    "( note : all of the integrals were taken as sums over a finite region around the fundamental peak , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) @xmath49 and @xmath50 contain information about the typical size of a domain and the distribution of wavenumbers , in the respective directions .",
    "we also analyzed the images by first converting them to a scaled image of zig and zag domains , referred to as the _ angle map_. this was done using the procedure detailed in ref .",
    "briefly , the local angle of the wavenumber is computed using the algorithm reported in ref .",
    "this is used to produce an image with black and white domains representing regions of zig and zag , respectively .",
    "regions of superposition of zig and zag rolls ( the domains wall for most of the quenches ) are represented by gray .",
    "figure  [ anglemap ] illustrates a typical image ( fig .",
    "[ anglemap]a ) and the results after conversion to an angle map ( fig .",
    "[ anglemap]b ) .",
    "once these images are produced , two measures of the domain growth that are independent of variations in the local wavenumber are computed .",
    "first , one can determine the total domain wall length per viewing area , @xmath53 .",
    "this quantity scales as the inverse of a characteristic domain size ( the area of the viewing scales as a length squared ) . in our case , @xmath53 was defined as the total number of gray pixels divided by the total area of the image . for all of the quenches except the ones at @xmath46 , the width of the domain walls was constant during the domain growth .",
    "therefore , this is a consistent measure of the total domain wall length . for the quench at @xmath54",
    ", we still used this definition for consistency , even though it represents a transitional behavior . in this case , some of the regions of superposition of zig and zag rolls ( gray pixels ) are more appropriately considered domains in their own right .",
    "still , most of the gray pixels corresponded to domain walls between zig and zag domains .",
    "we also computed the power spectrum of the angle map image , @xmath55 .",
    "in this case , the peak is centered at @xmath56 , as the angle map domains are uniform .",
    "therefore , the width of the peak is related to the typical domain size only .",
    "again , we separately considered the width in the x direction ( @xmath57 ) and y direction ( @xmath58 ) , where the widths are defined in the same manner as for @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ wavenumber ] shows the time evolution of the average wavenumber ( @xmath59 ) for the different quenches of interest .",
    "a number of features of the evolution are evident .",
    "first , as claimed , the steady - state value of the @xmath59 is dependent on @xmath36 ( see fig .  [",
    "wavenumber]a ) .",
    "however , for all quenches , the @xmath59 is still evolving even at late times .",
    "after @xmath60 , the evolution is consistent with a very slow logarithmic growth : @xmath61 , with @xmath62 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ wavenumber]b .",
    "however , for all but the largest value of @xmath47 , there is a weak dependence on when the logarithmic growth begins ( with values ranging from @xmath63 ) and on the coefficient ( @xmath64 ) of the logarithmic growth ( with values ranging from @xmath65 to @xmath66 . in general , for larger @xmath47 , evolution consistent with logarithmic time dependence occurs at a later time . as referred to in sec .",
    "ii , for @xmath67 , the pattern is qualitatively different . in this case , the evolution of @xmath59 is also very different , with logarithmic growth setting in significantly later ( @xmath68 ) and with a coefficient of @xmath69 .",
    "figure  [ sigma ] shows the evolution of the width of the power spectrum for both the pattern ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) and the angle map ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "there are a number of features that become apparent in these plots .",
    "first , if one were to assume that a scaling regime is reached , the growth exponent measured from @xmath5 is very different from that measured for @xmath55 .",
    "based on @xmath49 and @xmath50 , one observes very slow growth for the system . for late times , assuming @xmath70 , the exponents @xmath2 are on the order of @xmath71 .",
    "in contrast , the length scales characterized by the inverse of @xmath57 and @xmath58 grow faster . in this case , one obtains growth exponents of @xmath72 or larger .",
    "this difference is consistent with earlier results comparing @xmath5 , which includes information about the variation in local wavenumber , to more direct measures of the domain size @xcite .",
    "the second feature of the growth is the differences between the growth in the x- and y - directions . for the quench with @xmath73 , both @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "have the same magnitude and time dependence .",
    "this suggests that the system is evolving in a relatively isotropic manner . for @xmath49 and @xmath50 ,",
    "the time evolution is similar , though the magnitudes are different .",
    "this suggests that there is more anisotropy in the local wavenumber distributions than there is in the domains .",
    "this anisotropy contributes to the difference in magnitude between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , but does not impact the time evolution . for the case of @xmath46 ,",
    "the situation is roughly reversed . in this case ,",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 have roughly the same magnitude throughout the evolution .",
    "in contrast , @xmath57 and @xmath58 have different magnitudes and slightly different time evolution , at late times .",
    "this qualitative difference is probably due to the increased area of the pattern that is given by a superposition of zig and zag rolls , and thus , the change in the nature of the domain boundaries .    as an alternative measure of the domain growth",
    ", we also considered the total domain wall length present in a fixed viewing area .",
    "this measure is an _",
    "isotropic _ measure of the domain growth .",
    "its time evolution is a good measure of how rapidly the overall size of a domain changes .",
    "however , it does not provide any information about the relative rate of change in the x- and y - direction .",
    "figure  [ length ] shows the evolution of the total domain wall length for a number of values of @xmath36 .",
    "also shown are two straight lines that provide a guide to the eye .",
    "the dashed line has a slope of @xmath74 , and the solid line has a slope of @xmath75 .",
    "it is clear from this plot that the evolution of the domain size occurs more rapidly for the larger values of @xmath47 .    at this point",
    ", it is important to emphasize one of the challenges of interpreting data used to characterize domain growth . in studies of domain coarsening ,",
    "it is standard to assume that a late - time scaling regime exists in which the lengths characterizing the domain size grow as a power - law in time .",
    "one experimental difficulty with this assumption is determining when such a scaling regime is reached .",
    "this is especially true in the studies reported on here , where the average wavenumber is still evolving in time for all of the conditions that we studied ( even if it is only logarithmic in time ) .",
    "however , independent of whether or not a true scaling regime has been reached , for similar times during the evolution of the domains , the data is consistent with a power - law of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath76 is some characteristic length .",
    "therefore , the values of @xmath2 provide information about the relative rate of growth of domains under different circumstances .",
    "this is our main motivation for looking at @xmath2 .",
    "any claims of a true scaling regime would be premature at this point , though the consistency of the data with power - law behavior suggests that it is possible such a regime has been reached .",
    "figure  [ exponent ] summarizes the impact of variations in the wavenumber on the domain growth by comparing growth exponents @xmath2 for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and the total domain wall length per viewing area @xmath53 .",
    "the results from @xmath49 and @xmath50 exhibited no strong dependence on @xmath36 .",
    "one observes that the growth of the domains is significantly faster for larger @xmath47 , as measured by the total domain wall length in a given area . in this case ,",
    "@xmath2 increases in magnitude monotonically with @xmath47 .",
    "however , the trends in @xmath57 and @xmath58 are less obvious .",
    "if anything , one observes a small change in the magnitude of @xmath2 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 as @xmath47 is increased .",
    "also , the growth appears to become more anisotropic as @xmath47 increases .",
    "the experiments reported on here demonstrate the close connection between the dynamics of domain growth in patterned systems and the evolution of the background wavenumber .",
    "we performed a series of quenches in which the steady - state average wavenumber after the quench is varied .",
    "the resulting domain growth depends on the evolution and steady - state value of @xmath59 . however , different measures of the domain growth are impacted to different degrees . a direct measure of the typical domain size , the average domain wall length in a fixed viewing area , showed the strongest dependence on the average wavenumber , with the rate of growth increasing as the wavenumber is varied away from its `` natural '' value .",
    "if one assumes that the average domain wall length scales as a power in time , exponents in the range of @xmath77 to @xmath78 are observed . as discussed in the introduction , such a large variation in growth exponent is consistent with simulations of the two different swift - hohenberg equations @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the calculated exponent is found to increase from @xmath79 to @xmath80 with a variation in wavenumber of approximately 20% .",
    "this difference in average wavenumber was suggested as the source of the different exponents . the work in ref .",
    "@xcite does not directly apply to this system because it considered the isotropic swift - hohenberg equation , and our system is anisotropic .",
    "however , the similarity between the two results suggests that it is worth further work to determine how universal the impact of wavenumber variation is on domain growth in patterned systems .",
    "an interesting feature of the growth is that as one forced the average wavenumber to be different from the `` natural '' wavenumber of the system , the rate of growth was increased . in our case ,",
    "the maximum variation in wavenumber was only 6% , but the exponent changed from @xmath77 to @xmath78 .",
    "if these results carry over to other patterned systems , such as diblock copolymers , one can have a relatively significant impact on the rate of growth of domains by inducing a change in the average wavenumber away from the `` natural '' wavenumber .",
