    "the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation is a classical tool widely used to estimate the distance to local group galaxies and to external galaxies with hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations , as well as , through the calibration of secondary distance indicators , to even more distant stellar systems .",
    "this explains the dominant role of these variables on the route to solve cosmological problems such as the evaluation of the hubble constant @xmath8 and , in turn , of the age of the universe .",
    "the basic physics underlying the cepheid variability suggests that the pulsation period @xmath11 depends on the mass , luminosity and effective temperature of the pulsator . from stellar evolution theory one",
    "expects a close relation between mass and luminosity , and the natural result of these theoretical prescriptions is a period - luminosity - color ( plc ) relation , where the pulsator absolute magnitude @xmath12 in each given photometric passband @xmath13 is a linear function of the period and color index [ @xmath14 , as given by    @xmath15\\eqno(1)\\ ] ]    however , since the pulsation occurs within a finite zone of the hr diagram , the color term in the plc relation is often neglected and cepheid distances are usually estimated from the most favourite pl relation    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is now the average of the cepheid magnitudes for each given period .",
    "it should be noticed that whereas the plc relation holds for any individual pulsator , pl is a `` statistical '' solution which depends both on the pulsation boundaries and on the distribution of pulsators within the instability strip .",
    "this explains why distance determinations based on pl relations require statistically significant numbers of cepheids in order to reduce the effects of deviations from the ridge line .",
    "the pl relation in bolometric magnitude is traditionally assumed to be metal - insensitive ( see , e.g. , iben & renzini 1984 , freedman & madore 1990 ) and cepheid distances are generally derived by adopting _",
    "universal _ pl relations at different wavelengths , having the slope provided by the cepheids in the lmc and the zero - point referenced to the lmc distance , as obtained with independent methods ( see freedman 1988 ; kennicutt et al . 1998 ; walker 1999 , and reference therein ) , or to calibrating galactic cepheids ( see feast & catchpole 1997 ; lanoix et al . 1999 ) .    in the last years",
    ", we have deeply investigated the cepheid pulsational behavior through the computations of nonlinear , nonlocal and time - dependent convective pulsating models which take into account the coupling between pulsation and convection . with respect to linear - nonadiabatic models computed by different authors ( e.g. , chiosi et al .",
    "1993 ; saio & gautschy 1998 ; alibert et al .",
    "1999 ) , our theoretical approach allows reliable predictions on the temperature of both the blue and red edges of the instability strip , as well as about the amplitude and morphology of the light - curve ( see bono et al .",
    "1999a [ paper i ] , 2000a [ paper iii ] , 2000b [ paper vi ] ) .",
    "concerning the assumptions on the input physics , computing procedures and the adopted mass - luminosity relation , the reader is referred to paper i and paper iii , which contain also the detailed comparison of our models with the linear results in the literature . here",
    "we only remark that from pulsating models computed with three different chemical abundances ( @xmath1=0.004 , 0.008 and 0.02 ) we derived that the _ bolometric _ magnitude of metal - rich variables is , on average , fainter than that of metal - poor stars with the same period ( bono et al .",
    "1999b [ paper ii ] ) .",
    "moreover , we found that both the slope and zero - point of synthetic pl relations at different wavelengths depend on the pulsator metallicity , with the amplitude of the metallicity effect decreasing from visual to near - infrared magnitudes ( see paper ii ; caputo et al .",
    "2000 [ paper v ] ) . also the predicted plc relations at the different wavelengths turned out to be , in various degrees , metallicity dependent : as an example , for a given period and @xmath18 color , metal - rich pulsators are brighter than metal - poor ones , whereas they are fainter if the @xmath19 color is adopted ( see paper v ) . on these grounds",
    ", it has been shown that cepheid observations in three filters ( @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) allow to simultaneously constrain distance , reddening and metallicity of variables in the magellanic clouds ( caputo et al .",
    "1999 [ paper iv ] ) and in the milky way ( caputo et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "in this paper we will apply our theoretical scenario to the cepheids observed within two hst surveys : the `` extragalactic distance scale key project '' ( hereafter kp , see freedman et al .",
    "1994a ) and the `` type ia supernova calibration '' ( hereafter snp , see saha et al .",
    "the adopted procedure is briefly presented in sect .",
    "2 and the predicted reddenings and distances are given in sect .",
    "the metallicity effects on the cepheid distance scale and on the value of the hubble constant @xmath8 are discussed in sect .",
    "the concluding remarks close the paper .",
    "the results presented in paper v predict that the intrinsic dispersion of the synthetic pl relations with fixed metallicity decreases with increasing the filter wavelength , in close agreement with the observed trend ( see madore & freedman 1991 ; tanvir 1999 ) .",
    "moreover , we found that the predicted plc relations are almost independent of the pulsator distribution within the instability strip and reproduce the tight correlation between pulsation period and photometric parameters of individual pulsators , as earlier suggested by sandage ( 1958 ) , sandage & gratton ( 1963 ) and sandage & tammann ( 1968 ) .",
    "since hst observations are in the two passbands @xmath22 and @xmath23 , we adopt the predicted pl(@xmath23 ) and plc(@xmath0 ) relations given in paper v and reported here in table 1 and table 2 , respectively , to get the average reddening and true distance modulus of the cepheid samples from the observed intensity - weigthed mean magnitudes @xmath24 and @xmath25 , for each assumption about the cepheid metallicity . with respect to the classical method based on pl(@xmath22 ) and pl(@xmath23 ) ,",
    "our procedure aims at reducing the spurious effects caused by both the large dispersion of the observed pl(@xmath22 ) relation and the uncertainty on the predicted pl(@xmath22 ) relation as due to different pulsator distributions ( see paper ii and paper v ) .",
    "the offset of each cepheid from the predicted pl(@xmath23 ) and plc(@xmath0 ) relations gives the apparent distance moduli @xmath26=@xmath3+@xmath27 and @xmath28=@xmath3+@xmath29 , respectively .",

    "( 1989 ) , the reddening @xmath2 and true distance modulus @xmath3 of each cepheid are derived . eventually , by averaging over the sample of variables , we provide the predicted mean values , for the three adopted metallicities .",

    "1998 ) , let us first compare the predicted reddening and distance with @xmath1=0.008 to the lmc - based empirical values .",
    "it seems worth mentioning that we have already found a fair agreement between the empirical pl(@xmath22 ) and pl(@xmath23 ) relations and our predictions with @xmath1=0.008 ( see paper v ) .    as for the galaxies in table 3",

    "we show in fig .",
    "1 that the discrepancy is for each galaxy well within a total uncertainty on the distance of the order of 10% ( dashed lines ) . this is a reassuring result as to the reliability of the adopted method of analysis and our pulsating models with @xmath1=0.008 .",
    "moreover , one has to consider that both kp and snp studies assume @xmath43=18.50 mag and @xmath44=0.10 mag , and that the above differences of @xmath410.05 mag and @xmath420.05 mag with respect to the predictions with @xmath1=0.008 could be easily removed by slightly increasing ( decreasing ) the adopted lmc distance ( reddening ) .",
    "on the other hand , the theoretical results depend on assumptions such as the adopted mass - luminosity ratio , bolometric corrections and temperature - color relations .",
    "thus , revisions of input physics and/or atmosphere models might modify the results in table 5 and table 6 , but with marginal effects on the relative distances and reddenings .",
    "as a fact , by applying our method to the lmc cepheids ( madore & freedman 1991 ) we get @xmath4518.6 mag and @xmath460.03 mag .",
    "accounting for these results , the actual discrepancy between empirical and predicted results is @xmath470.05 mag and @xmath480.02 mag , in the mean .    on the contrary",
    ", it seems important to notice that different distributions of cepheids within the instability strip may produce non - systematic effects on both distance and reddening . as a matter of example ,",

    "] , the derived reddening and true distance modulus are @xmath10 0.10 mag lower than the actual values , whatever is the adopted method of analysis . on these grounds ,",
    "one understands that statistically significant samples of variables are required in order to get accurate distance and reddening determinations . otherwise , selection effects on distant cepheids ( the variables close to the blue edge are brighter than those near the red edge , for fixed period ) lead to underestimate both the distance and reddening .",
    "as already mentioned , for some of the kp galaxies in table 3 the cepheid data have been reviewed by the same team , leading to a slight systematic increase on the distance . from the data listed in italics in table 3",
    "one finds that the average upward revision is of the order of @xmath100.09 mag .",
    "as discussed in ferrarese et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , this is a consequence of the adopted lower cut - off in period , as the empirical distance modulus increases when the lower period cut - off is moved from 10 to 20 - 25 days . on the theoretical side , we show in table 5 ( see values in italics ) that using the same selection as in ferrarese et al .",
    "( 1999 ) causes a systematic increase of the predicted true distance modulus by only @xmath100.05 mag .",
    "this suggests that the cut - off in period has minor influence upon our pl(@xmath23)+plc(@xmath0 ) procedure , supporting the belief that robust distance determinations should adopt only plc relations , for which cepheid observations in at least three filters are needed .",
    "concerning the snp galaxies , we give in table 6 the predicted distances as obtained from the full set of cepheid data provided in the original papers , while the values in italics refer to the cepheid samples as selected by the snp team .",
    "one notices that the adopted selection criteria yield rather discordant effects on the predicted distance . with @xmath1=0.008 , the true distance modulus of four galaxies increases ( from 0.05 mag for ngc 4496a to 0.44 mag for ngc 3627 ) , whereas it decreases by @xmath640.11 mag for ic 4182 .",
    "moreover , limiting the comparison to the snp empirical distances obtained from the selected samples ( table 4 ) , the difference with respect to the predicted distance modulus with @xmath1=0.008 ( in italics in table 7 ) ranges from @xmath640.30 mag ( ic 4182 ) to + 0.22 mag ( ngc 4536 ) , which is somehow larger than that ( from @xmath640.12 mag for ic 4182 to + 0.18 mag for ngc 3627 ) found by adopting kp results for the same galaxies ( see table 3 and table 5 ) .",
    "it is known that the disagreement between snp and kp distances to the same galaxy ( up to 0.47 mag for ngc 5253 ) deals with different pipeline processing procedures , selection criteria and data reduction strategies , and the interested reader can find a detailed discussion in gibson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and tammann et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . here",
    "we have to face up to the evidence that by using the cepheid data selected by snp studies the overall discrepancy between empirical and predicted distances with @xmath1=0.008 is somehow larger ( see fig .",
    "2 ) than that found with kp data ( filled circles in fig .",
    "1 ) . for this reason , the rest of our analysis will deal exclusively with the results of kp studies .    throughout the above discussion we used",
    "the cepheid predicted distance with @xmath1=0.008 , neglecting the evidence that the oxygen abundance of the galaxies in table 3 varies from [ o / h]@xmath650.50 to @xmath10 + 0.40=log(o / h)-log(o / h)@xmath66 , with log(o / h)@xmath66=-3.10 . ] .",

    "on the other hand , the data in table 5 show that the predicted cepheid reddening and true distance modulus decrease as the adopted metallicity @xmath1 increases . this is a consequence of the fact that our metal - rich pulsating models are , on average , fainter than metal - poor ones . resuming the discussion in sect .",
    "3 , let us assume that for our cepheid holds @xmath670 with respect to the pl relations with @xmath1=0.008 .",
    "this yields @xmath68=@xmath69 and @xmath70=@xmath51 .",

    "the decrease of the reddening with increasing the adopted metallicity yields that almost all the galaxies show unpleasant negative values of @xmath2 with @xmath1=0.02 .",
    "however , as already mentioned , our theoretical scenario suggests @xmath760.03 mag for the cepheids in the lmc , while both the kp and snp studies assume @xmath44=0.10 mag .",
    "thus , were our predictions calibrated on this galaxy , then all the reddening values in table 5 and table 6 should be increased by 0.07 mag .    since our purpose is the evaluation of the metallicity effects on the distance scale , in the mean we derive @xmath770.27@xmath350.04 mag dex@xmath6 , at least within the explored range 0.004@xmath78 0.02 .",
    "the sense of this result is that when universal relations are used , the cepheids more metal - rich than the calibrators will appear spuriously _ brighter_. on this basis , the predicted correction ( in magnitude ) to empirical lmc - calibrated distance moduli is given by    @xmath79    where @xmath7 is the difference between the cepheid metallicity and the lmc value of @xmath1=0.008 .    in the following section we investigate into the effects of this metallicity correction to kp distances by assuming that the cepheid metal content scales with the hii region metallicity , i.e. adopting @xmath7=@xmath80[o / h ] , the difference between the galaxy [ o / h ] abundance and that of the lmc ( [ o / h]=@xmath640.40 ) .",
    "observational pros and cons for this assumption will be discussed .",
    "figure 3 shows the difference between the empirical kp data and the predicted true distance modulus when the oxygen abundance of the cepheid fields is taken into account .",
    "as expected , the almost flat distribution in fig.1 now shows a clear correlation to the hii region metallicity , with the discrepancy between lmc - calibrated and theoretical distances increasing when moving from metal - poor to metal - rich galaxies .",
    "however , one notices that for very few galaxies the discrepancy overcomes the threshold of 10% ( dashed line ) .",
    "of particular interest is the behaviour of the eight galaxies ( the six snp galaxies plus ngc 3368 and ngc 4414 ; filled circles ) which give cepheid - calibrated snia luminosities ( see later ) .    as a first straightforward test to the actual occurrence of a metallicity effect",
    ", we consider the kp distance to galaxies members of groups or clusters .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "4 shows the residuals @xmath81 and @xmath82[o / h ] of each galaxy from the distance modulus and o / h metallicity as averaged over the galaxies of the same group or cluster .",

    "larger _ distance .",

    "this is a not dramatic variation , nevertheless it seems interesting to settle whether it works to decrease or increase the present dispersion of @xmath8 values . within this context",
    ", it is worth noticing that the well known disagreement between the `` high '' and `` low '' @xmath8 values claimed by kp and snp studies , respectively , are not due entirely to the already mentioned different distances to snia calibrating galaxies . as discussed by gibson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the methodology adopted by the snp group with kp distances leads to @xmath87 63 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 dex@xmath6 , which is 9% higher than the snp average value ( @xmath87 58 km s@xmath6",

    "moreover , the calibration of snia luminosities presents a variety of different approaches and the same kp distances , coupled with the suntzeff et al .",

    "however , the absolute value of the hubble constant is out the purpose of this paper .",

    "the linear regression to the points ( dotted line ) is    @xmath89,\\eqno(6)\\ ] ]    suggesting a metallicity correction as @xmath86 [ o / h]@xmath10 + 0.069 dex@xmath6 which is roughly half the amount predicted on the basis of eq .",

    "applying the kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) correction to the true distance moduli [ eq .",

    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "5 shows that this would produce a more evident correlation between @xmath8 and [ o / h ] , with two estimates overcoming the discrepancy of 10% from the average value ( dashed lines ) . on the other hand , the lower panel of fig .",
    "6 shows that our predicted metallicity correction @xmath90/@xmath80[o / h]@xmath100.124 dex@xmath6 would yield @xmath8 values which agree to within 10% , but slightly increasing as the [ o / h ] abundance increases .",
    "eventually , in order to remove any dependence of @xmath8 on the galaxy metallicity ( see upper panel in fig .",
    "6 ) , we suggest that _ at least _ the empirical evidence in fig .",
    "5a should be taken into consideration , i.e. , @xmath90/@xmath80[o / h]@xmath100.069 dex@xmath6 , leading to a slight upward revision of the kp unweighted mean of @xmath91=67.0@xmath354.3 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 to @xmath91=68.6@xmath353.9 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 .    as said before , the determination of @xmath8 deals with several factors apart from the distance to the snia calibrating galaxies .",
    "thus , we are giving the predicted value of the hubble constant , but only the result of the predicted metallicity - correction to the kp @xmath8 estimates , still holding their adopted approach in the treatment of snia data and distance to lmc .",
    "hst galaxies with published cepheid distances have been studied to the light of a theoretical pulsational scenario based on nonlinear , nonlocal and time - dependent convective models with three selected metallicities ( @xmath1=0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 ) .",
    "theoretical pl and plc relations in the @xmath0 passbands have been used to predict cepheid distance and reddening for each adopted metal content .",
    "the comparison of the predictions with @xmath1=0.008 ( the average metallicity of the lmc ) to the lmc - calibrated empirical results provided by the kp group shows a mutual agreement , better than that found with snp results .",
    "the predicted pl and plc relations suggest that the cepheid distance should decrease with increasing the adopted metallicity and that lmc - based distance moduli should be corrected according to @xmath920.27@xmath7 mag dex@xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the difference between the cepheid metallicity and the lmc mean value of @xmath1=0.008 .",
    "theoretical studies which adopt a linear pulsational approach , being unable to get firm predictions on the red edge of the instability strip , can not disprove this result .    on the observational front ,",
    "earlier evidences suggest an opposite metallicity correction as given by @xmath93=+0.24@xmath80[o / h ] mag dex@xmath6 ( kennicutt et al . 1998 ) , where @xmath80[o / h ] is the o / h metallicity difference between the cepheid field and the lmc mean value ( [ o / h]@xmath650.40 ) .",
    "however , we show that the kp true distance modulus to galaxies members of clusters or groups seems to be correlated with the galaxy o / h metallicity in good agreement with our predictions .",
    "* the comparison between baade wesselink radii for galactic and magellanic clouds cepheids ( laney 1998 , 1999 , 2000 ; feast 1999 ; storm 2000 ) suggests that metal - rich variables are fainter than the metal - poor ones . *",
    "the purely `` geometric '' distance to the galaxy ngc 4258 , as obtained from maser sources rotating around the central black hole , is 7.2@xmath350.5 mpc ( herrnstein et al .",

    "one has [ o / h]@xmath100.12 ( zaritsky et al . 1994 ) , the kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) correction would increase the distance to @xmath10 8.6 mpc , whereas our predicted correction gives @xmath107.6 mpc . *",
    "a carefully selected sample of 236 cepheids from the hipparcos catalogue suggests that the slope of the galactic pl relations could be shallower than that observed for lmc variables ( groenewegen & oudmaijer 2000 ) , thus suggesting some caution in the adoption of universal pl relations .    as a whole ,",
    "both the predictions and the empirical evidences seem to confirm that the metallicity effect on the cepheid distance scale is not dramatic , with a correction factor of @xmath650.14 mag to the lmc - based distance modulus of any galaxy whose metallicity is 0.5 dex larger than that of the lmc .",
    "the consequent predicted metallicity correction to the hubble constant is @xmath90/@xmath80[o / h]@xmath10 + 0.124 dex@xmath6 , which means an increase of @xmath10 6.2% in the lmc - based @xmath8 values of any snia calibrator whose metallicity is 0.5 dex larger than that of the lmc .",
    "taking the kp @xmath8 estimates at their face value , we show that the observed correlation with the [ o / h ] metallicity of the cepheid fields suggests @xmath90/@xmath80[o / h]@xmath10 + 0.069 dex@xmath6 , which is more consistent with our prediction rather than the metallicity correction based on the kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) empirical results ( @xmath90/@xmath80[o / h]@xmath650.111 dex@xmath6 . ) on the basis of this , we eventually suggest that the average value provided by the kp team @xmath967 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 should be increased _ at least _",
    "up to @xmath9 69 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "the adoption of a metallicity correction to lmc - based empirical estimates of @xmath8 might hopefully reduce the present uncertainty of 10% on the average value to a 5% level .",
    "unfortunately , the variety of the current methods of calibrating snia luminosities give very different results for the absolute value of the hubble constant . as an example ( see gibson et al .",
    "2000 ) , the suntzeff et al .",
