    "weak lensing of the large scale structure ( cosmic shear ) is one of the most powerful methods for constraining the cosmological model and is sensitive to both the growth of structure and to the expansion history of the universe ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , so far weak lensing data has been available for only small regions of the sky ( @xmath3200 deg@xmath4 )    surveys that will produce large weak lensing data sets have begun ( dark energy survey(des ) , hyper suprime - cam(hsc ) , panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system(panstarrs ) , the kilo - degree survey(kids ) ) or are being built ( lsst , euclid , the wide - field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) ) .",
    "the statistical power of forthcoming weak lensing data sets , which will cover thousands or tens of thousands of square degrees , makes it necessary to consider the effect of systematic errors that could previously be ignored .",
    "the cosmic shear analysis relies on the accurate measurement of shapes of as many as tens of billions of background galaxies , to statistically estimate the small distortion ( about @xmath5 ) caused by weak gravitational lensing . to fully benefit from the increased statistical power of the new surveys , systematic errors",
    "must not significantly degrade the cosmological parameter errors .",
    "some imperfections in ccds become apparent when they record a uniform illumination ( flat fields ) .",
    "structure in the images reveals several patterns that are not due exclusively to quantum efficiency variations .",
    "concentric arcs , called tree rings ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) are due to impurity gradients in the ccds which cause electric fields transverse to the surface of the ccd .",
    "patterns aligned with the rows and columns of the pixels are due to periodic pixel - size variation caused by errors in the masks used in the step - and - repeat process manufacturing ( @xcite ) .",
    "both these effects can change the shape of galaxy images . for weak lensing analyses ,",
    "we quantify the shape changes as spurious shear or spurious convergence .    for the tree rings ,",
    "we show how to calculate the spurious shear and spurious convergence from the flat field images . for the pixel - size variation ,",
    "we calculate the spurious convergence which is directly related to the size of the pixel .    the primary statistics for inferring cosmology from weak lensing surveys is the 2-point correlation function of shear or convergence , and its fourier transform , the power spectrum",
    ". the 2-point correlation function of spurious shear must be much smaller than that due to cosmological shear if cosmological parameters are to be accurately inferred .",
    "the biases in cosmological parameters are determined by calculating how much the inferred parameters change when the spurious convergence is added to the lensing convergence ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we give an overview of how we compute the bias in cosmological parameters from the spurious convergence . in section 3 , we describe the measurement of tree rings , the spurious 2-point correlation function it causes , and the parameter bias it induces . in section 4 , we describe the measurement of pixel - size variation , the 2-point correlation function of the spurious convergence and the parameter bias it induces .",
    "we summarize our findings and discuss further work in section 5 .",
    "weak gravitational lensing causes changes in the apparent position of point sources . for a source at @xmath6 observed at displaced position @xmath7 due to lensing",
    ", the shift is described by a 2@xmath82 transformation matrix ( @xcite )    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , the convergence , describes the isotropic distortion ( magnification ) of an extended source , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , the shears , describe anisotropic distortions of the image .",
    "detector imperfections can cause distortions of the images of galaxies resulting in spurious shear and convergence , biasing the cosmological parameter determination .",
    "previous work has described biases due to the atmosphere , telescope and detector in terms of spurious shear ( @xcite ) .",
    "however the convergence and the shear are alternative descriptions of lensing , the convergence is related to shear ( up to a uniform mass sheet degeneracy ) through a non - local kaiser - squires inversion ( @xcite ) .",
    "the power spectrum of convergence is equal to the power spectrum of e - mode shear .",
    "we point out here that spurious convergence is in some cases a more convenient description of ccd imperfections than spurious shear .",
    "the spurious convergence due to pixel - size variation is easily calculated from the change in the pixel area from its nominal value . since for lensing , convergence is proportional to the mass surface density , it is clear that if we consider an area composed of many pixels , the convergence is just the average of the convergence of the constituent pixels .",
    "the bias calculation is performed using a fisher formalism ( see for example @xcite . let @xmath13 be the convergence from weak lensing in a field of view of size @xmath14 , and let @xmath15 be its power spectrum defined as @xmath16 we used the superscript 0 to denote the convergence measured from a pure lensing signal , not including systematic effects . in this equation , and in the remainder of this section , the hat ( @xmath17 ) on a quantity @xmath18 means that the quantity is an estimator and we use the tilde @xmath19 to denote the fourier transform of @xmath18 .",
    "the subscripts @xmath20 are shorthands for the multipole moments @xmath21 .",
    "we also indicate the dirac delta function and the kronecker delta symbol as @xmath22 respectively . in the limit",
    "in which @xmath13 is a gaussian field , the power spectrum estimator @xmath23 has an expectation value @xmath24 and a variance @xmath25 , where the mode number @xmath26 is computed as see @xcite    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the width of the multipole bins used in the analysis .",
    "because the convergence field is statistically isotropic , the power spectrum measured at a multipole @xmath29 depends on the magnitude @xmath30 of the two dimensional multipole moment @xmath29 .",
    "now let @xmath31 the derivative of @xmath32 with respect to cosmological parameter @xmath33 and @xmath34 the @xmath23 estimator covariance matrix , which we approximate as diagonal @xmath35 defining    @xmath36    we can estimate the bias @xmath37 in the cosmological parameters @xmath38 when fitting a field of view with spurious convergence added @xmath39 as @xmath40 where the superscripts @xmath41 , 0 refer to the power spectrum measured from a field of view with and without spurious convergence added ( @xcite ) .",
    "the same fisher formalism can be used to estimate the marginalized errors @xmath42 on the parameters when using a single field of view @xmath43 we note that when using the full survey data rather than a single field of view , parameter errors can be much smaller since @xmath44 . for lsst , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "equation ( [ biasexpr ] ) can be further expanded as    @xmath47 =   m_{\\alpha i}\\left(p^{sp}_i + \\frac{\\hat{\\tilde{\\kappa}}_i^0\\tilde{\\kappa}_i^{sp,*}+\\hat{\\tilde{\\kappa}}_i^{0,*}\\tilde{\\kappa}_i^{sp}}{(2\\pi)^2}\\right)\\ ] ]    the spurious convergence @xmath48 is calculated from laboratory measurement of the ccds . since the imperfections are fixed on the ccd focal plane ,",
    "there is only one realization of the spurious convergence and it spans the field of view of the telescope . because of this , the spurious convergence @xmath49 becomes a non stochastic quantity ( and hence written without the hat ) .",
    "we can compute the expectation value and standard deviation of the bias estimator ( [ biasestimator ] ) and get @xmath50    @xmath51    since the spurious convergence is non stochastic , the standard deviation of the bias estimator ( [ varbias ] ) is proportional to the standard deviation of @xmath52 , which scales as @xmath53 .",
    "these results are correct for a single field of view , when the analysis is scaled to the full survey side the expectation value of the bias does not change , but the standard deviation of @xmath52 gets reduced by a factor of @xmath54 .",
    "the same reduction applies to the bias variance in ( [ varbias ] ) .",
    "we note that the stochasticity in the bias is due to the cross term in ( [ biasestimator ] ) and is a result of cosmic variance in the lensing convergence field .",
    "@xmath55 can be quite large compared to @xmath56 even for @xmath57 .",
    "the estimated survey bias is    @xmath58",
    ".    we will quote the larger of the two values as the estimated survey bias .    to compute @xmath59 in the fiducial cosmological model with @xmath60 , as well as the derivatives @xmath31",
    ", we make use of the public code nicaea ( @xcite ) which gives good accuracy for the lensing power spectra in the parameter range we are considering .",
    "we assume a redshift distribution of galaxies concentrated in single redshift @xmath61 . in the lensing convergence power spectrum @xmath23",
    "we include the effects of galaxy shape for the assumed @xmath62 galaxies/@xmath63 .",
    "an approximate scaling relation of the bias with the galaxy density can be obtained noting that , in the limit in which shape noise dominates , @xmath64 scales as @xmath65 . because the derivatives @xmath66 and the spurious power @xmath67 do not depend on @xmath68 , the bias expectation value does not change with @xmath68 , but its standard deviation roughly scales with @xmath69 .",
    "tree rings are due to impurity gradients in the silicon of which ccds are made .",
    "the high - purity , high - resistivity silicon used in recent astronomical ccds grows cylindrically from molten state .",
    "time variations in temperature , composition , etc .",
    "produce radial impurity gradients which result in resistivity gradients .",
    "ccds made from slices of the cylindrical boule have electric fields transverse to the main field due to the resistivity gradients leading to the displacement of photo - generated charge .",
    "thick ccds used for increased near ir ( @xmath3 1 micron ) sensitivity suffer greater charge displacement due to longer path length .",
    "though the tree rings are observed in flat field images , they do not correspond to quantum efficiency variations .",
    "instead , they induce a displacement of the collected charge that propagates into astrometric and photometric biases . in this section",
    "we describe how to calculate the spurious shear and spurious convergence due to tree rings from the flat - field images and apply the method to the lsst candidate sensors .",
    "we then calculate the 2pcf and bias of cosmological parameters .      in practice , it is possible to directly measure the astrometric displacement @xmath70 as function of scalar radius @xmath71 , caused by the tree rings by using sets of several dithered exposures of star fields in different photometric bands and constructing  star flat \" images ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the displacement is defined from differences between the original position @xmath72 and the displaced position by the tree - ring effect @xmath73 ; it is defined as @xmath74    however , this is not an easy task given that the displacement is small ( of the order of subpixels ) .",
    "however , it is easy to measure flux modulation @xmath75 due to tree - ring , defined as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is average flux at radius @xmath71 and @xmath78 is average flux of all pixels .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that , to first order , there exists a relationship between the tree - rings flux modulation @xmath75 as measured by the flat fields ( which have higher s / n compared to the one provided by the limited number of stars in the star flats ) and the astrometric displacement @xmath70 , given by @xmath79 note the sign convention here differs from that in @xcite .",
    "because the displacements caused by tree rings have only radial components , shape changes are measured easily by considering the change in radial length and tangential length of images .",
    "consider the effect of the displacement field on an infinitesimal image between radius @xmath73 and @xmath80 and @xmath81 and @xmath82 in polar coordinates , where the origin of the coordinate system is set to the center of the concentric displacement .",
    "thus , the image is mapped from the original position @xmath72 and @xmath83 and @xmath84 and @xmath85 by the tree ring displacement field , which is written as a function @xmath86 .",
    "figure [ fig : cd ] shows the relation between the images .",
    "the extent of the image in the @xmath71 direction relate to each other as in equation [ eq : tr_d ] and @xmath87 the shape change can be obtained by taking the ratio of the length of the images in both the radial and tangential direction .",
    "thus , the radial size change is given by @xmath88 and the tangential size change is given by @xmath89 for convenience , and without loss of generality , let us consider a situation where @xmath90 .",
    "then we can arrange equation [ eq : cdist_r ] and [ eq : cdist_t ] in matrix form , obtaining @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the convergence and shear due to the tree - rings displacement , defined as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is positive for radial shear and negative for tangential shear .",
    "thus , the two components of the shear , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , at @xmath96 can be written as @xmath97 by using equation [ eq : tr_d_f ] , [ eq : tr_conv_d ] and [ eq : tr_shear_d ] can be written in terms of the flux modulation @xmath98 where the last approximation is valid when the displacement is much smaller than the radius .",
    "the typical spatial scales of the displacements are of the order of subpixels , and the radii of the order of 100@xmath991000 pixels , so the approximation is valid .",
    "this means that the convergence and shear due to the tree rings are approximately half the value of the flux modulation . for shear @xmath100 at @xmath96 in polar",
    "coordinates relative to a fixed origin , the radial and cross shear are given by @xmath101 .",
    "the tangential shear is obtained as @xmath102 .    .",
    "]      we measured the tree - ring patterns of two different lsst candidate ccds .",
    "here we discuss only one ccd type , since results for the other were similar .",
    "we used flat - field images from a uniform light source of @xmath103 nm wavelength .",
    "the ccds have approximately 4000@xmath84000 pixels , each one with a physical size of 10 microns @xmath8 10 microns .",
    "the ccds are 100 microns thick for near ir sensitivity .",
    "we have 25 flat field images , and each image has approximately 62500 mean electron counts per pixel .",
    "first we corrected the flat field images to eliminate other effects by following steps :    * masked regions near the edge of the detectors and shadows due to dust particles in the optics . *",
    "the light source in this test was not completely uniform , so fit the slow variation with a 7th order polynomial for each readout channels , then normalized by the polynomial . *",
    "stacked the normalized 25 flat images .",
    "* measured the laser annealing pattern and pixel variation pattern , then simply divided the flat fields by the patterns .",
    "* removed other large scale fluctuation in fourier space .    though pixel - size variation also will result in its own pattern of spurious distortion , for the tree - ring analysis we removed both pixel - size variation and laser annealing effects by scaling the image .",
    "we discuss pixel - size variation in detail in the next section .",
    "we determine the center of the tree ring profiles in each ccd by selecting points on several rings and then fitting for their common center .",
    "the center of the rings lies near of the corner of the ccd , but slightly offset from it ( see figure [ fig : sstr_2dim ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sstr_1dim ] shows the measured tree - ring profiles . before measuring the profiles , the images were smoothed by a gaussian kernel with a 5-pixel standard deviation .",
    "since the width scale of the tree rings peaks is about @xmath104 pixels , the smoothing should not reduce their amplitude by much .",
    "the typical amplitude of the flux modulation is approximately @xmath105 , about 50 times smaller than that on the decam ccds reported by @xcite .",
    "the tangential spurious shear is calculated from the flux modulations by using equation [ eq : tr_shear_f ] ( the spurious shear is about half value of flux modulation ) .",
    "the typical amplitude of the spurious shear is of about @xmath106% .",
    "the displacement is calculated by using equation [ eq : tr_d_f ] .",
    "the typical amplitude of the astrometric displacement is about @xmath107 pixels @xmath108 arcseconds .",
    "this means the displacement caused by tree - ring effect does not cause significant missregistrations .",
    "here we calculate the 2-point correlation function ( 2pcf ) of the spurious shear induced by tree rings on the lsst ccds .",
    "first , we calculate the spurious shear pattern on each individual ccd from the observed flux modulation ( figure [ fig : sstr_2dim_color ] left panel ) .",
    "the spurious shear 2pcf is calculated from @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( see for example @xcite )    @xmath111    a typical galaxy used for lsst weak lensing analysis subtends 1 arcsec , comparable to the 0.7 arcsec psf .",
    "each pixel subtends 0.2 arcsec .",
    "so a typical galaxy image covers @xmath112 pixels .",
    "the scale on which tree - ring shear varies is approximately 100 pixels , so the spurious shear does not change significantly over a galaxy image .",
    "thus the spurious shear for a galaxy is approximately equal to the spurious shear at any pixel within the galaxy image .",
    "the lsst focal plane is composed of 21 rafts , each raft composed of 9 ccds .",
    "we assume that all ccds in the raft have the same tree ring profile but with random orientations differing by 90 degree rotations .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : sstr_2dim_color ] shows the spurious shear pattern for a single raft .",
    "we assemble a virtual lsst focal plane out of 25 rafts arranged in square applying random 90 degree rotations to each raft .",
    "figure [ fig : sstr_2cor_ccd_log ] upper panel shows the 2pcf of spurious shear due to tree rings for a single lsst ccd .",
    "the typical value is about @xmath113 .",
    "at very short spatial scales we can see a slightly larger peak .",
    "this value is much smaller than the square of the typical amplitude of the spurious shear , @xmath114 .",
    "the smallness of the 2pcf results from a cancellation between alternate signs of spurious shear in its calculation .",
    "the 2pcf averages over pairs of galaxies at a fixed separation .",
    "the sign of the spurious shear due to tree rings alternates on the tree ring scale as is seen in figure [ fig : sstr_2dim_color ] .",
    "with 30 galaxies per square arcmin , each ccd will record @xmath1155@xmath116 galaxies per pointing , and @xmath117 galaxies for the @xmath1152@xmath116 pointing over the course of the survey .",
    "dithering will further reduce the effect of the imperfections we consider .",
    "thus there are a huge number of pairs of galaxies at similar separations but with differing sign of spurious shear . there is less of a cancellation on scales comparable to the ccd size , due to the smaller number of pairs at that separation . at scales",
    "less than the 100 pixel tree ring scale , both points may lie on the same tree ring .         of spurious shear caused by tree rings on lsst ccds .",
    "absolute values are shown ; the values oscillate around zero .",
    "upper panel is for a single ccd .",
    "lower panel is for the full lsst focal plane . ]",
    "[ fig : sstr_2cor_ccd_log ] lower panel shows the 2pcf of the spurious shear on an area equivalent to the full field of view of the lsst camera with a @xmath104 pixel sampling scale .",
    "the typical scale for the amplitude decreases to @xmath118 due to further averaging down for the reasons described above .    in comparison ,",
    "the lensing 2pcf @xmath119 predicted by nicaea ( @xcite ) for the fiducial cosmology with a lsst - like galaxy distribution varies monotonically from @xmath120 at 1 arcsec separation ( 5 pixels ) to @xmath121 at @xmath122 arcsec separation ( 20,000 pixels ) .",
    "the fact that the spurious shear two point function is much smaller than the weak lensing signal is encouraging , but is not sufficient by itself to say that the bias on the cosmological parameters is negligible . to quantify the former bias , we need to isolate the features of the two point function that are most sensitive to cosmology , and study how the spurious power in this feature space affects our parameter estimates .",
    "we quantify the bias on the cosmological parameters in the following section .",
    "the bias in cosmological parameters caused by tree rings can be calculated from the spurious convergence as described in section 3 .",
    "figure [ fig : pl_tr ] shows the spurious convergence power spectrum @xmath123 used to calculate the bias caused by tree rings .",
    "the spurious power fluctuates randomly around @xmath124 and does not show a systematic trend with @xmath125 . the spurious power spectrum was calculated on a grid with each element of the grid 30@xmath830 pixels and the convergence averaged over the grid element .",
    "table [ tab : bias_tr ] shows the amplitude of the bias due to tree rings .",
    "the biases shown in table [ tab : bias_tr ] are very much smaller than the expected marginalized errors @xmath126 for lsst which are are 0.00232 for @xmath1 , 0.02434 for @xmath0 and 0.00427 for @xmath2 , calculated as described in section 3 assuming 30 galaxies per square arcminute at z=2 .",
    "the marginalized errors will be somewhat smaller if tomography is used .",

    "we describe in detail all the steps necessary to go from flat - field images to spurious shear and convergence , then to 2-point correlation functions and spurious power , and finally to bias in cosmological parameters .    for tree rings , we use new formulae developed here to calculate the spurious shear and convergence from the astrometric displacements , and a model developed by @xcite to estimate the astrometric displacement from the flux modulations measured in flat - field images .    for the lsst ccds ,",
    "the typical value of flux modulation due to tree rings is @xmath105 , about 50 times smaller than that for the decam ccds .",
    "the typical amplitude of spurious shear is @xmath128 the typical amplitude of the 2-point correlation function over the lsst focal plane is about @xmath129 .",
    "the 2pcf is much smaller than the square of the typical amplitude of the spurious shear due to cancelations of tangential and radial shears in the calculation .",
    "the 2pcf is much smaller than the lensing 2pcf suggesting , but not proving that it can be ignored .",
    "we go further and calculate the bias to cosmological parameters and find it to be negligible .",
    "we point out that spurious convergence is the natural way to describe the effect of pixel - size variation , and calculate the spurious convergence , which is directly related to the size of the pixel , from the counts in individual pixels in flat - field images .",
    "the width of rows and columns thus determined varies in a periodic way . for the lsst",

    "we calculate the bias to cosmological parameters due to pixel - size variation and find it to be larger than for tree rings , but still negligible compared to the marginalized errors .    in this study",
    "we have only considered the impact of tree rings and pixel size variation on cosmological parameters derived from the lensing power spectrum .",

    "<S> imperfections in the detectors used to record images of the sky can introduce changes in the apparent shape of galaxies , which in turn can bias the inferred cosmological parameters . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider the effect of two widely discussed sensor imperfections : tree - rings , due to impurity gradients which cause transverse electric fields in the charge - coupled devices ( ccd ) , and pixel - size variation , due to periodic ccd fabrication errors . </S>",
    "<S> these imperfections can be observed when the detectors are subject to uniform illumination ( flat field images ) . </S>",
    "<S> we develop methods to determine the spurious shear and convergence ( due to the imperfections ) from the flat - field images . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate how the spurious shear when added to the lensing shear will bias the determination of cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our methods to candidate sensors of the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) as a timely and important example , analyzing flat field images recorded with lsst prototype ccds in the laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> we find that tree - rings and periodic pixel - size variation present in the lsst ccds will introduce negligible bias to cosmological parameters determined from the lensing power spectrum , specifically @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>"
