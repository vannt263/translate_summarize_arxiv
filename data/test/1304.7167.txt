    "today , nano  particles can be synthesized with a variety of shapes  @xcite and arrangements  @xcite , allowing for different applications . to unveil the full potential of these nano  particle based applications  @xcite in general , it is imperative to understand and characterize the wide range of intriguing properties of these nanoscale entities .",
    "important structural and compositional information can be obtained from high resolution imaging of these particles in their native form .",
    "it is crucial to realize that not only the shape but also the nearly always present surfactant layer influences the properties of the nano  particles  @xcite .",
    "scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) is routinely used to obtain information on the shape , size and arrangement of nano  particles .",
    "this method is very successful in this research field as it is minimal invasive and can achieve the required resolution of a few nano  meters down into the sub  nanometer range  @xcite . with the advent of new detectors that allow energy filtering and separation of the different contributions to the signal as well as the possibility to use ultra  low acceleration voltages ,",
    "the surface sensitivity of the method has also increased substantially .",
    "alternatively , a new charged particle scanning beam microscopy method has entered the market a few years ago .",
    "helium ion microscopy ( him )  @xcite has an ultimate resolution as small as 0.29 nm  @xcite and a very high surface sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "it uses helium ions to generate a multitude of signals including secondary electrons ( se ) , backscattered helium ( bshe ) and photons .    despite their obvious advantages , both methods ",
    "sem  @xcite as well as him  @xcite  are plagued by carbon deposition in the scanned area .",
    "this carbon deposition reduces image quality and in particular hinders the detection of ultra ",
    "thin carbon layers intentionally present on the sample .",
    "him is particularly sensitive to this effect for two reason .",
    "firstly , helium ions with a typical energy of 30kv are very efficient in cracking hydrocarbons present on the sample surface .",
    "these hydrocarbons are either present on the sample and/or replenished from the vacuum during imaging . secondly ,",
    "due to the high surface sensitivity of him already very thin layers of carbon will be visible in the image .",
    "in particular the last point also applies for very low  voltage sem .",
    "however , applying appropriate cleaning procedures to the chamber as well as the sample prior to imaging this problem can be eliminated .",
    "provided that deposition of carbon from the chamber vacuum can be excluded a very high sensitivity for intentionally deposited ultra ",
    "thin carbon layers is possible in him  @xcite .    as a result of the surfactant assisted fabrication routes",
    "nano  particles are usually covered by such a thin carbon based layer . in the case",
    "discussed here , gold nano ",
    "rods are covered with an interdigiting double layer of cetyltrimethylammonium ( cta ) which is formed during synthesis using cta  bromide ( ctab ) .",
    "comparison of small angle x  ray scattering ( saxs ) and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) measurements revealed that the thickness of this shell is between 1.0 nm and 1.5 nm  @xcite  and thus less than the length of a single stretched cta molecular ion of 2.2 nm  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will present high ",
    "resolution images of ctab / au core  shell nano  particles obtained with sem and him . in this context",
    "the underlying reasons for the visibility of either the gold  core or ctab  shell in the different imaging modes will be discussed . by comparing core and shell",
    "we show that the thickness of the cta layer can be measured with sufficient accuracy reducing the necessity for more elaborate measurement strategies such as saxs and tem .",
    "ctab  stablized gold nano ",
    "rods of aspect ratios 4 and 5 were synthesized using a seed  mediated synthesis  @xcite . to remove excess ctab from the suspensions",
    ", they were centrifuged at 15000rpm for 10minutes .",
    "the supernatant was carefully removed , leaving the sedimented nano ",
    "rods in the bottom of the centrifugetube .",
    "finally , the nano ",
    "particles were resuspended in the same amount of milli  q water .",
    "this procedure was performed twice .",
    "in addition , the suspensions were centrifuged at 5600rpm for 5minutes to eliminate most spheres from the suspension . ultraviolet ",
    "visible ( uv  vis ) spectroscopy was used to identify typical resonances in the as  prepared nano ",
    "particles consisting of rods and some remaining spheres .",
    "the longitudinal peaks were situated at 800 nm and 860 nm for nano  rods of aspect ratio 4 and 5 , respectively . the corresponding rod lengths amount to 45nm@xmath05 nm for aspect ratio 4 and 55nm@xmath05 nm for aspect ratio 5 .",
    "the width of all rods is between 10 nm and 12 nm .",
    "samples were prepared for him and sem analysis , by drop  casting 30l of each suspension onto a clean sio@xmath1 substrate . within 2h",
    "the liquid has completely evaporated , leaving a coffee ",
    "stain ring of gold nano ",
    "no further sample conditioning was necessary for the subsequent sem and him imaging .",
    "him measurements were performed using an ultra  high vacuum ( uhv ) orion plus helium ion microscope from zeiss  @xcite . the microscope is equipped with an everhardt  thornley ( et ) detector for secondary electron ( se ) detection .",
    "a micro  channel plate situated below the last lens just above the sample allows the qualitative analysis of backscattered helium ( bshe ) .",
    "this detector yields images in which dark corresponds to light elements  having a low backscatter probability  and bright areas  with a high backscatter yield  correspond to heavy elements in the specimen .",
    "high resolution scanning electron microscopy ( hrsem ) measurements were performed using a merlin field emission sem ( fe  sem ) from zeiss .",
    "the microscope is equipped with a on  axis in  lens secondary electron detector as well as a high efficiency off ",
    "axis secondary electron detector .",
    "the in  lens detector  which has been used in this study  is a high efficiency detector for se1 and se2 and owes its superb imaging results to the geometric position in the beam path and the combination with the electrostatic / electromagnetic lens .",
    "this detector is in particular powerful at low voltages provided a small working distance can be reached .      in order to asses",
    "the yield and origin of secondary electrons as well as backscattered electrons in sem , monte carlo simulations using casino  @xcite have been utilized .",
    "the sample was modeled using a 2 nm thick carbon layer on a 10 nm thick gold slab on top of a silicon substrate .",
    "the density of the carbon layer has been manually set to 0.5g/@xmath2 .",
    "secondary electron and backscattered electron yields were calculated as well as the @xmath3 distribution .",
    "srim  @xcite calculations have been used to obtain insight into the contrast ratios for backscattered helium images .",
    "backscatter yields for nano  rods and cta covered silicon were calculated using the kinchin ",
    "pease approximation .",
    "the same sample setup as above has been used with the exception that the carbon layer has been replaced with a layer of cta stoichiometry and a density of 0.5g/@xmath2 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : him - sem](a ) a him image of gold nano ",
    "rods is presented .",
    "the image has been obtained from an area covered by several layers of nano  rods .",
    "an acceleration voltage of 34.9kev and an ion dose of @xmath4@xmath5 were used .",
    "although the alignment of the rods is visible , the blanket covering them makes the recognition of individual rods difficult .",
    "this blanket is formed from residues ",
    "mostly ctab  of the nano  rod synthesis .",
    "however , a sem image of the same area is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : him - sem](b ) .",
    "an acceleration voltage of 0.7kev and a probe current of 50pa has been used to record the image . here",
    ", the rods are clearly visible and the ctab blanket is only visible where it is very thick ( e.g. in the upper right corner of the hole ) .",
    "the effect of the blanket is best seen by comparing the area marked with an arrow . from the two crevices visible in the sem image",
    "one is not visible at all while the other is barely visible in the him image .",
    "figure  [ fig : him ] shows high resolution him images and cross sections obtained from an area with a low density of gold nano",
    "the image has been recorded using an acceleration voltage of 20kv and an ion dose of @xmath6@xmath5 .",
    "this corresponds to 375 ions per pixel .",
    "a larger working distance had to be chosen to accommodate the bshe detector .",
    "a length of 45nm@xmath010 nm and a width 15nm@xmath04 nm has been obtained from the secondary electron image presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : him](a ) .",
    "this results in an aspect ratio of 3 for these cta covered rods . in fig .",
    "[ fig : him](b ) the simultaneously recorded bshe image is presented .",
    "the images have been recorded with an intermediate primary energy of only 20kev to ensure an enhanced bshe signal from the nano  rods .",
    "the energy of 20kev has been specifically selected to increase the cross section for he scattering .",
    "although lower energies would result in even higher bshe yields , 20kev is a good compromise between bshe yield and se as well as bshe image resolution . although the signal is still relatively weak the nano ",
    "rods appear slightly smaller in the bshe image . a composite image  created using red and green for the se and the bshe signal , respectively  is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : him](c ) .",
    "several rods are visible showing a yellow core  a result of the compositing process between red and green  surrounded by a thin green border .",
    "this is a result of the cta shell surrounding the gold nano",
    "the fact that the gold cores of the nano ",
    "rods are smaller than the nano  entities in se mode is also evident from the three selected cross sections shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : him](d ) .",
    "rod diameters  obtained from gaussian profiles  are listed in table  [ tab : x - sections ] .",
    ".nano  rod diameter obtained from gaussian profiles fitted to the cross sections ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : him](d ) ) marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : him](a)-(b ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this shift results in the fact that at higher voltages the signal from the thin carbon layer diminishes in the huge contribution  composed of se and bse  from the gold core .",
    "the used in ",
    "lens detector allows for the efficient collection of these electrons at the small working distance used during measurement .",
    "it is the strong energy dependence of the se as well as the bse yields which is further enhanced by the choice of materials .",
    "both contributions amplify the effect and allow the selective imaging of core and shell using different voltages .    from the diameter difference of roughly 3 nm ( see table  [ tab : sem ] ) between lv and hv sem images , we estimate a cta shell thickness of 1.5 nm . again",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with the expected cta shell thickness of 1.0nm1.5 nm  @xcite .",
    "we present a comparative investigation of ctab layer thickness on gold nano  rods using him and sem .",
    "both methods can selectively image the gold core or the surrounding cta shell . in him",
    "this is achieved by simultaneously recording the se and bshe signals . in sem switching between",
    "ultra  low voltage and higher voltage imaging achieves the same result . although the detector efficiencies in bshe mode are extremely high and less than 10 backscattered helium atoms are sufficient to obtain a decent signal , the quality of the bshe images is inferior to the high resolution him ",
    "se images obtained from the ctab layer .",
    "this is at least partially due to the uhv him equipment used .",
    "the base pressure of less than @xmath7 mbar ensures that thin carbon layers can be imaged over prolonged periods without adding new carbon as a result of cracking of hydrocarbons present in the sample chamber .",
    "in particular lv ",
    "sem suffers from this problem and thin carbon layers are quickly deposited in the investigated area . on the other hand sem",
    "has a faster sample turnover time and excels in the visualization of the gold cores . for the latter ,",
    "carbon deposition is not an immediate problem and the definition of the rods is excellent allowing precision measurements of particle core length and width .    from both methods we estimated a ctab layer thickness of 1.0 nm ( him ) ",
    "1.5 nm ( sem ) .",
    "both values are in excellent agreement with the expected thickness of 1.0 nm ",
    "both methods arrive independently at values smaller than the full length of the cta molecule .",
    "deviations from the ideal double layer cta structure can easily explain this discrepancy .",
    "curled up molecules or an incomplete double layer coverage will result in a thinner effective cta shell .    in summary",
    ", we have successfully measured the thickness of ultra ",
    "thin ctab layers using him and sem .",
    "however , while sem excels in revealing the gold nano  rods , him is superior in the visualization of the ctab layer .",
