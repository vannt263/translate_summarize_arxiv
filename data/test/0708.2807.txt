    "there are several advantages in studying a heavy - light system on a lattice .",
    "first of all , the lattice calculations are relatively easy to do , and it allows us to do these with qcd from first principles .",
    "our meson is much more simple than in true qcd : one of the quarks is static ( infinitely heavy ) with the light quark `` orbiting '' it .",
    "this makes it very beneficial for modelling . on the lattice",
    "an abundance of data can be produced , and we know which state we are measuring .",
    "in contrast , the physical states can be a mixture of two or more configurations , but on the lattice this complication is , mostly , avoided .",
    "even so , our results on the heavy - light system can still be compared to the @xmath2 meson experimental results .",
    "we measure the energies of both angular and first radial excitations of heavy - light mesons . since the heavy quark spin decouples from any description of the configurations we may label the states as @xmath3 , where l is the orbital angular momentum and @xmath4 refers to the spin of the light quark .",
    "the measurements are done on @xmath5 lattices using two degenerate quark flavours .",
    "the lattice configurations were generated by the ukqcd collaboration using lattice action parameters , @xmath6 and three different values for the hopping parameter @xmath7 ( see table  [ latparams ] ) .",
    "the three different lattices are referred to here as `` df3 '' , `` df4 '' and `` df5 '' .",
    "each of them has a slightly different lattice spacing ( @xmath8 ) and a different light quark mass ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "our main results are measured on the `` df3 '' lattice , because the light quark mass is very close to the strange quark mass .",
    "more details of the lattice configurations used in this study can be found in refs .  @xcite . because our light quarks are heavier than true _",
    "u _ and _ d _ quarks , we have @xmath10 ranging from 730  mev ( `` df3 '' ) to 400  mev ( `` df5 '' ) .",
    "two different levels of fuzzing ( 2 and 8 iterations of conventional fuzzing ) are used in the spatial directions to permit a cleaner extraction of the excited states .",
    ".lattice parameters ( from  @xcite ) .",
    "the sommer scale parameter can be taken to be @xmath11  fm and @xmath12 is the _",
    "quark mass .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "* with the `` df3hyp '' lattice , our predictions for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 p - wave state masses agree very well with the experimental results .",
    "we also predict that the masses of the two lower p - wave states ( @xmath15 and @xmath13 ) should lie only a few mev below the @xmath16 and @xmath17 thresholds respectively . * also with the `` df3hyp '' lattice , the p - wave spin - orbit splitting is small ( essentially zero ) , but the d - wave spin - orbit splitting is clearly non - zero and positive . in contrast , another lattice group finds the p - wave spin - orbit splitting to be positive ( about 35  mev ) and the d - wave sos to be slightly negative ( see  @xcite ) , i.e. they seem to observe the famous inversion @xcite .",
    "however , the recent european twisted mass collaboration results find the p - wave sos to be negative and the d - wave sos to be small @xcite .",
    "one clearly needs to go to the continuum limit before any definite conclusions can be made .",
    "+ in  @xcite woo lee and lee suggest that the absence of spin - orbit inversions can be explained by chiral radiative corrections in the potential model .",
    "small spin - orbit splittings throughout the meson spectrum could be explained by a relativistic symmetry in the dirac hamiltonian discussed in  @xcite .",
    "this would indicate that the scalar potential is ( at least approximately ) equal to the vector potential . * the one - body dirac equation model with one - gluon exchange , vector and scalar linear potentials and",
    "a scalar term @xmath18 ( like a flux tube rotational energy ) is not good enough to describe the entire lattice energy spectrum .",
    "therefore , one should be very careful in using such simple potentials to describe the interaction between quarks .",
    "i am grateful to my collaborators , professors a.m. green and c. michael , and to the ukqcd collaboration for providing the lattice configurations .",
    "i wish to thank professor philippe de forcrand for useful comments and also the center for scientific computing in espoo , finland , for making available the computer resources .",
    "this work was supported in part by the eu contract no .",

    "to check that the different results for different smearings ( specifically for the spin - orbit splittings ) are a real effect and not due to some biasing element in the final analysis , we plot the basic signals in figs .  [ fig : sos_hyp_vs_sum6 ] for the p - wave .",
    "the signals clearly are different for `` df3sum6 '' and `` df3hyp '' , supporting the results of the complete analysis in fig .",
