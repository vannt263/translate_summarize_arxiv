    "one of the preeminent tasks of contemporary theoretical physics is to seek a mathematically consistent higher - dimensional explanation for the chiral fermion spectrum and gauge symmetries of the standard model . over the last decade ,",
    "string theory has precipitated a virtual miasma of related ideas .",
    "recently , two different sorts of constructions have emerged as compelling avenues for the derivation of effective physics from within both string theory and also its elusive non - perturbative cousin , _ m_-theory . on the one hand ,",
    "brane - world models @xcite , obtained by consistent inclusion of intersecting d - branes and open strings in various background geometries @xcite , have succeeded in providing a plausible context for the standard model itself @xcite . on the other hand , _ m_-theory has inspired a search for a more elegant eleven - dimensional underpinning to some of these same constructions , and has stimulated an interest in the physically - relevant mathematical characterization of @xmath1 holonomy seven - manifolds @xcite .",
    "there are two essential obstructions which have hampered the search for _",
    "m_-theoretic phenomenology as compared to string theory analogues .",
    "one is the fact that a fundamental description of _ m_-theory has not yet emerged .",
    "the other is that much less is known about @xmath1 holonomy seven - manifolds than is known about calabi - yau threefolds .",
    "thus , it is difficult to provide geometric explanations for the symmetries and spectra which may arise in _",
    "m_-theory compactifications .",
    "however , there is one restricted class of constructions tailor - made to shed light on each of these two problems , which also includes a built - in mechanism for resolving effective physics .",
    "this is the class of models based on global orbifold compactifications of eleven - dimensional supergravity .",
    "one reason why orbifold compactifications are so useful in _ m_-theory is that it is relatively simple to answer the question of how much supersymmetry is preserved on the various fixed - planes of a given orbifold , provided the action of the associated quotient group has a well - defined lift to the eleven - dimensional spinorial supercharge .",
    "it is therefore a straightforward exercise to categorize a wide class of supersymmetric orbifolds in _ m_-theory .",
    "presumably these singular constructions can be resolved to smooth , compact @xmath1 manifolds @xcite , and therefore provide a skeletal basis for the characterization of such spaces .",
    "especially useful are the stringent constraints , based on local anomaly cancellation , which allow one to readily discern chiral states and additional characteristic classes (  rational bundle data \" ) localized on the network of fixed planes . in this way , many _",
    "m_-theory orbifold models are very similar to string theory brane - world constructions .    in the interest of developing a robust and useful algorithm for extracting effective physics from generic supersymmetric _",
    "m_-theory orbifolds , we analyze and resolve the network of constraints which follow from the necessary requirement of gauge and gravitational anomaly cancellation point - wise in eleven dimensions .",
    "quite a bit of the necessary apparatus has been developed in preceding papers @xcite . with some",
    "care the technology described in those papers can be applied to a wide class of models .",
    "it is opportune , therefore , to investigate which orbifold constructions are especially interesting , so that we can proceed to cycle through these , model - by - model , in the interest of identifying those which have the greatest phenomenological appeal , to enable an appropriately thorough comparison with string theory models , and to learn as much as possible about the world of _ m_-theory physics .    considering _",
    "m_-theory on a spacetime with topology @xmath2 , the preservation of @xmath3 supersymmetry requires that @xmath4 have @xmath1 holonomy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the presence of chiral fermions and non - abelian gauge symmetries in four dimensions adds another requirement to the structure of @xmath4 , namely , this space can not be smooth ; it must possess singularities of one sort or another @xcite .",
    "one constructive approach , which easily includes both the @xmath1 requirement and also the requirement of singularities is to focus on global orbifold constructions . in this case",
    ", we can replace the geometric holonomy constraint with the requirement that some components of the eleven - dimensional supercharge are preserved at each point .",
    "since this can be readily implemented on global orbifolds @xmath0 , rather than on merely local models of orbifold singularities ( e.g. , @xmath5 ) , we gain insight into the physics corresponding to global @xmath1 compactifications .",
    "more generally , we would like to study all possible orbifolds @xmath0 , where the torus @xmath6 is itself defined as a quotient @xmath7 , with @xmath8 a generic lattice in @xmath9 and @xmath10 a subset of the automorphisms of @xmath8 .",
    "it is worthwhile , however , to restrict attention to an important subset of these constructions , namely those for which @xmath11 is an abelian finite group represented by rotations in three complex planes plus the possibility of a parity flip in an additional real coordinate . in these cases",
    "each element of @xmath10 lifts to an action on spinors , such as the supercharge @xmath12 , in a manner which is especially amenable to analysis .",
    "one can thereby readily determine the set of supersymmetric orbifolds of this class .",
    "we make one more important restriction : we limit attention to those orbifolds for which no group element acts freely on any of the coordinates of @xmath6 .",
    "we call these _ hard _ orbifolds . in this case",
    ", each element has fixed planes associated with it , and the set of fixed planes generically intersect as an intricate tangle .",
    "geometrically , these models are more interesting than the related cases in which @xmath10 includes elements with fixed - point - free  shifts \" on one or more coordinates .",
    "these latter types we call _ soft _ orbifolds .",
    "one can consider the hard orbifolds as more fundamental , because each soft orbifold can be obtained from a hard orbifold by  softening \" operations in which , for instance , a coordinate reflection is replaced with a shift .",
    "geometrically , such softening operations either eliminate some of the fixed planes , or they take two fixed planes which intersect , and move them off of each other , thereby eliminating the intersection .",
    "the number of hard abelian orbifold models which maintain supersymmetry is surprisingly restrictive .",
    "for instance , if one looks only at finite groups @xmath10 with order less than or equal to twelve , there are exactly @xmath13 such models , as depicted in table [ scan ] .",
    ".a scan of supersymmetric hard abelian orbifolds of _ m_-theory .",
    "non - zero numbers in the table indicate the multiplicity of supersymmetric orbifolds @xmath14 for the indicated abelian finite groups .",
    "the torus dimension @xmath15 corresponds to the column and the quotient group @xmath10 correlates with the row .",
    "stars indicate supersymmetric horava - witten models : those which include an isolated @xmath16 factor .",
    "note that there are nine of these in the scan , six of which have been described previously ; the simplest of the remaining three , namely the starred @xmath17 model , is described in this paper . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +",
    "we have made a microscopic analysis of the local anomaly cancellation requirements associated with a special _ m_-theory orbifold .",
    "the construction we have studied is the simplest abelian quotient @xmath0 which does not involve any freely acting involutions and which gives rise to a chiral four - dimensional spectrum . by demanding that all local anomalies at each point on each even - dimensional orbifold plane and orbifold - plane intersection vanish , we are able to determine a particular anomaly - free chiral spectrum associated with a pair of four - dimensional brane - worlds , linked by a five - dimensional bulk .",
    "a central part of our analysis relies on the group - theoretic restrictions related to what we have defined as  consistently - entwined embeddings \" of subgroups inside of subgroups .",
    "we find it intriguing that these essentially crystallographic constraints emerge so naturally from intricate local anomaly considerations and , more - so , that these matters are so readily resolved .",
    "we are engaged in applying these same techniques algorithmically to a systematic scan of a large class of _ m_-theory orbifolds .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to explain some of the core details of our algorithm , so that we can focus more exclusively on results in subsequent papers .",
    "we also find the details amusing .",
    "owing to a comparative dearth of inroads , it remains relatively difficult to describe effective four - dimensional physics from a purely _ m_-theoretic standpoint as compared to the situation in conventional string theory .",
    "for instance , in the case of string compactification schemes , detailed analyses of d - brane configurations on various orientifold backgrounds have allowed for a reasonably concise top - down approach towards the determination of chiral spectra , supersymmetry breaking , and the computation of superpotentials .",
    "it remains somewhat mysterious how to determine all of the analogous data using what is yet known about _",
    "this fact is both a hindrance and a help .",
    "it is helpful because it forces us to use the small amount of constraints available , mostly in the form of local anomaly conditions , for all they are worth .",
    "what is interesting , however , is just how snugly these conditions fit the problem .",
    "an open question is how to describe the _ lift _ of particular string compactification schemes to _ m_-theory , if possible .",
    "one simple known example is the case of the non - compactified @xmath18 string . in this case , from the point of view of the effective theory , one may decompactify the @xmath18 supergravity theory by merely adding in a new circular dimension .",
    "another simple example is the case of the non - compactified @xmath19 heterotic string . in that case one",
    "decompactifies the coupled @xmath3 supergravity - yang - mills theory by stretching a line segment out of each point in the originally ten - dimensional spacetime , keeping one @xmath20 sector on one ten - dimensional end - of - the - world and the other @xmath20 sector on the other ten - dimensional end - of - the - world . by way of contrast",
    ", the @xmath21 string does not have such a direct _ m_-theory lift .",
    "this is related to the fact that the gauge group @xmath21 can not be consistently factorized ; it resists being torn - apart . in each of these cases ,",
    "the subset of models which admit a direct lift corresponds to those which coincide with consistent _",
    "m_-theory compactifications .",
    "but what about more exotic situations",
    "? suppose one starts , for instance , with a @xmath18 string compactified on a particular orientifold , in the presence of a particular collection of d - branes and open strings . a given scenario of this sort may or may not admit a clean lift to _ m_-theory .",
    "one method for probing this question is to compare the effective theory associated with a given string compactification scheme with the relevant set of consistent _ m_-theory compactifications ( assuming it is possible to delineate these ) .",
    "as regards the _ m_-theory side of this issue , if we remain within the class of orbifold compactification schemes described in this paper , then the limitations on consistent effective descriptions correlate with the limited number of consistently - entwined embeddings of aggregate gauge lattices .",
    "plausibly , these in turn correlate with subsets of the ways that one can consistently wrap d - branes on internal cycles of compactification spaces in string theory . in the _",
    "m_-theory approach one relies on group theory and crystallography , whereas in the d - brane picture one relies more heavily on the homology of the compactification spaces",
    ". it might be interesting to explore such relationships .",
    "one relevant observation is the appearance of various bi - fundamental representations in the effective _",
    "m_-theory spectra which we have derived . from the d - brane point of view",
    ", these should arise from open strings stretched from one stack of d - branes to another .",
    "we notice , however , in the _",
    "m_-theory model which we have derived , the appearance of other representations such as the higher antisymmetric tensors of @xmath22 ( the * 15 * and the * 20 * of @xmath23 , for instance ) .",
    "it is less clear how to correlate these states with string theory analogues .",
    "it would be interesting to explore further the relationship between _",
    "m_-theoretic spectra and string - theoretic analogues .",
    "we expect that the models which we describe should descend to particular cases of @xmath18 string theory compactified on calabi - yau orientifolds with d - branes wrapping internal cycles of these spaces . among other things",
    ", we are actively probing such questions .",
    "in four dimensions , gauge anomalies appear in the presence of chiral spinor fields @xmath24",
    ". assume the internal gauge group has @xmath15 simple factors and @xmath25 abelian @xmath26 factors , = _",
    "i=1^ng_i_l=1^mu(1)_l . assume , as well , that the chiral spinors can be described by @xmath27 sets of fields transforming according to = _ i=1^s(*r*_1i , ... , * r*_ni)_q_i1, ... ,q_im , where @xmath28 describes the representation of the @xmath29th set of chiral fields in @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the @xmath32th associated @xmath26 charge .",
    "anti - chiral spinors @xmath33 transforming according to a representation @xmath34 can be replaced by their charge conjugate spinors @xmath35 , which transform according to @xmath36 . without loss of generality",
    ", we therefore conventionally express fermion spectra exclusively in terms of chiral spinors , rather than as a mixture of chiral and anti - chiral spinors . in this case , the gauge anomaly is described , via descent equations , by the formal six - form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the matrix - valued two - form field strength associated with @xmath39 .",
    "gauge anomaly cancellation is equivalent to the requirement that the six - form @xmath40 vanish .",
    "this requires that each of the following numbers vanish , i(g_i)_l & & _",
    "i_*r*_i n(*r*_i)_iq_il i_2(*r * ) + i(u_1)_l , gauge & = & _ in_iq_il^3 , [ ganom ] where @xmath41 is the second index of the representation @xmath42 associated with the @xmath43th simple factor @xmath30 , @xmath44 is the multiplicity of fields in @xmath45 transforming in the representation @xmath42 of @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are the total number of fields in @xmath45 .",
    "we are also interested in the gauge / gravitational  mixed \" anomaly .",
    "this anomaly is related by descent , to the formal six form @xmath48 .",
    "mixed anomaly cancellation is equivalent to requiring that the six - form @xmath49 vanish .",
    "this is equivalent to requiring that the following numbers vanish , i(u_1)_lmixed & = & _ in_iq_il .",
    "[ manom ] thus , mixed anomaly cancellation requires that , for each @xmath26 factor , the sum of all the charges vanish .",
    "( note that , taken together , gauge and mixed anomaly cancellation require the sum of the charges and also the sum of the _ cubes _ of the charges vanish . )",
    "each representation of a classical lie algebra has a set of associated rational indices . for instance",
    ", the second index of a representation @xmath51 is defined by the relationship _ * r*f^2=i_2(*r*)trf^2 , where the trace on the left - hand side is over the representation @xmath51 and the trace on the right - hand side is over the fundamental representation .",
    "there is a useful and concise algorithm , derived in @xcite , for determining representation indices for any antisymmetric tensor representation of @xmath50 .",
