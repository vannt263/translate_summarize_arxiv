    "strong ovi absorptions observed around starforming galaxies at @xmath8 with impact parameter as high as 150 kpc reveal huge gaseous galactic haloes @xcite .",
    "even conservative estimates lead to amount of gas in them far exceeding the gas reservoir in galaxies themselves .",
    "such a conclusion is based on the assumption that gas in the haloes has solar metallicity .",
    "the arguments underlying this assumption stem from the standard estimate of oxygen mass from the observed column density @xcite [ mo ] m_o = 5r^2n__ovim__o f_hit ( 0.2 f__ovi ) = 1.210 ^ 7 ( 0.2f__ovi)m _ , where a typical column density @xmath9 @xmath3 , the halo radius @xmath10 kpc , the hit rate correction factor ( covering factor ) @xmath11 are assumed following by @xcite , @xmath12 is atomic mass of oxygen .",
    "the fractional abundance of ovi under thermal collisional ionization equilibrium never exceeds @xmath13 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such that within this assumption eq .",
    "( [ mo ] ) provides a lower estimate of oxygen mass in the halo @xcite .",
    "it is readily seen from here that the mass @xmath14 , i.e. around 10 to 70% of oxygen mass in the ism , is indeed a conservative estimate .    in principle , this conclusion for galactic haloes to bear such a large gas mass would might solve the problem of missing baryons and metals @xcite , though requiring enormously high oxygen production and mass ejection rates .",
    "moreover , the fraction @xmath13 under collisional ionization equilibrium is kept only in a very narrow temperature range : @xmath15",
    "k ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore totally unrealistic to assume that all observed haloes keep their temperatures within such a narrow range independent on distance from the host galaxy .    in their estimates",
    "@xcite used the ionic fractions calculated under collisional and/or photoionization equilibrium conditions , i.e. independent of time @xcite .",
    "however , ionization state of gas situated in time - dependent ( nonequilibrium ) environment can differ qualitatively from the one settled on to equilibrium , particularly , for solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "this difference can be smaller for low - density gas exposed to a strong ionizing field .",
    "however , in the process of galactic evolution both the magnitude and the shape of the radiation spectrum can change . in addition the extragalactic spectrum , which can be important on the periphery of galactic haloes ,",
    "does also evolve @xcite . under such conditions",
    "it is natural to expect the ionic composition to experience time variations .    in this paper",
    "we therefore concentrate on the question of whether evolution of the ionizing radiation field can result in considerable changes of fractional ionization of oxygen such to make estimates of gas mass in galactic haloes more reliable . in next sections",
    "we will demonstrate that indeed under time - dependent conditions the observed column densities of ovi correspond to at least half order of magnitude less massive haloes , which can stay in a much wider range of physical parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the details of the model . in section 3",
    "we present our results .",
    "section 4 summarizes the results .",
    "thermal and ionization state in our model is fully time - dependent : the model involves ionization and thermal evolution of gas located at radii @xmath16  kpc in the galactic halo , exposed to extragalactic and galactic time - dependent ionizing radiation field .      in this paper",
    "we only briefly touch main features of calculation of the ionization and thermal evolution of gas immersed into external time - dependent ionizing radiation .",
    "the details can be found in @xcite .",
    "we study ionization and thermal evolution of a lagrangian gas element : a gas parcel is assumed to be optically thin to external ionizing radiation . in the calculations we include all ionization states of the elements h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si and fe . we take into account the following major processes : photoionization , multi - electron auger ionization process , collisional ionization , radiative and dielectronic recombination , collisional excitation as well as charge transfer in collisions with hydrogen and helium atoms and ions .    the total cooling and heating rates are calculated using as a subroutine the photoionization code cloudy ( ver . 10.00 ,",
    "more specifically , we input into cloudy code a given set of all ionic fractions @xmath17 calculated at temperature @xmath18 , gas density @xmath19 and external ionization flux @xmath20 and obtain the corresponding cooling and heating rates .",
    "the latter also includes compton heating from x - rays .",
    "for the solar metallicity we adopt the abundances reported by @xcite , except ne for which the enhanced abundance is adopted @xcite . in all calculations",
    "we assume the helium mass fraction @xmath21 , which corresponds to [ he / h]=0.081 , and is close to the observed one @xcite .",
    "we solve a set of 96 coupled equations ( 95 for ionization states and one for temperature ) using a variable - coefficient ordinary differential equation solver @xcite .",
    "we considered the two regimes of gas evolution : isochoric and isobaric .",
    "the isochoric regime suggests that gas density in a cloud is kept constant , while in isobaric model gas pressure is assumed constant .",
    "the two regimes correspond to two opposite limits of the ratio between the cooling and the sound crossing times : @xmath22 and @xmath23 , correspondingly . in the external heating radiation field",
    "isobaric models show essentially similar thermal and ionization evolution , though on longer time scales due to decreasing density coupled to increasing temperature .",
    "it results in an increase of the cross - section of gas clouds such that their covering factor increases as well .      in the process of galaxy evolution",
    "the stellar content changes : massive stars produce enormous number of uv photons and form ultimately compact objects which emit hard ionizing photons",
    ". spectrum of the ionizing radiation escaping galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) and exposing further the halo depends on amount of metals in the ism disk absorbing ionizing photons , and thus on chemical evolution of the galaxy . in order to follow evolution of stellar mass , metallicity and galaxy spectrum , we use the spectro - photometric code pegase @xcite .",
    "we assume a schmidt - like power - law starformation rate ( sfr ) : @xmath24 , typical sfr for massive starforming galaxies , where @xmath25 is the normalized mass of gas in @xmath26 . in some regions of the galaxy sfr",
    "can be inhibited by gas outflows from the disk , however , when averaged over the whole disk the sfr remains sufficiently high over the whole period of active star formation . in our models",
    "we assumed a closed - box regime .",
    "in general , though this can not be applied to galaxies with active star formation . however , many parameters related to mass and energy exchange between galaxies and the intergalactic medium , such as the rates of mass ejection from and mass accretion from the ambient medium , gas metallicity and corresponding cooling rate , clustering of sne explosions , etc are highly uncertain and hard to be coherently described phenomenologically .",
    "gas in galactic haloes is exposed by a cumulative ionizing background consisting of the extragalactic and the galactic components .",
    "the extragalactic component is uniform on galactic halo scales , and is nearly constant on timescales @xmath27  myr , while changes significantly on longer times . for the extragalactic background",
    "we accept the spectrum described by @xcite .",
    "its evolution covers redshifts @xmath28 to @xmath29 divided by 49 equally spaced log bins .",
    "contribution from possible flux sources varies over cosmological time , and irregular changes in different bands of the spectrum with redshift can be met .",
    "for this reason simple linear approximation between neighbour redshift bins was used .    the galactic component instead ,",
    "may change on much shorter timescales . in general , the corresponding time scale is close to the lifetime of massive stars , i.e. @xmath30  myr .",
    "this galactic radiation component originates in the central star forming region , and is seen from outer parts of the halo at distances @xmath31  kpc as a nearly spherical domain of size of @xmath32  kpc .    the ionizing radiation from stellar population is partly modified by absorption in the interstellar medium of underlying bulge and disk .",
    "in order to account this absorption we assume that ionizing photons pass through a layer of neutral gas in galactic disc with the optical depth @xmath33 , throughout the paper @xmath34  @xmath3 , @xmath35  @xmath3 are considered as fiducial .",
    "the corresponding optical depths at the hi and hei lyman limits are as high as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . as a result only photons with @xmath38  ev escape the galaxy and penetrate into halo ; the ionizing flux with photons of @xmath39  ev decreases as @xmath40 . in what follows",
    "we will discuss the dependence of our results on the hi column density .    in our model",
    "the galactic uv spectrum is calculated with making use the pegase code @xcite , which gives spectral luminosity in the range from 91  to 160  @xmath41 m . in order to extend the spectrum to higher energies ( up to @xmath42 ev , responsible for ionization of highly charged ionic species ) we use the empirical relation between the x - ray luminosity and the star formation rate ` @xmath43 ' @xcite .",
    "this relation is well established for massive starforming galaxies considered here .",

    "this assumption meets though difficulties because the minimum oxygen mass in the halo obtained within such an assumption reaches around 10 - 70% of the total oxygen mass in the ism @xcite , which requires in turn unprecedentedly high mass exchange between the galactic ism disk and a huge circumgalactic reservoir extending up to 150  kpc .",
    "higher ovi fraction obtained in our model reduces the estimates to a more reasonable level , and as a consequence weakens constrains on the sources of oxygen in underlying galaxies .",
    "contrary , an order of magnitude lower metallicity results in a more consistent scenario of metal production and mass exchange between galactic and circumgalactic gas .",
    "indeed , the total mass of the circumgalactic gas in ovi haloes within @xmath182  kpc is about @xmath183 independent on redshift as estimated from hi data @xcite .",
    "if such gas would be enriched to the metallicity as high as @xmath53 , then the oxygen mass in it equals @xmath184 .",

    "this timescale is significantly shorter than the whole period of the evolution ",
    "several gyrs , and comparable to the initial period of evolution in our models with the sfr kept nearly constant ( upper panel on figure  [ figssfr - time ] ) .",
    "because of the high sfr during initial several hundreds myrs , gas can be ejected from the disk with velocities @xmath186  km / s sufficient to reach @xmath75100  kpc in approximately 1  gyr .",
    "we assumed throughout that metals are honogeneously distributed in a spherical layer between 50 and 300  kpc .",
    "this can be an overestimate , because in general the volume occupied by ejected metals depends on the galaxy mass and for dwarf galaxies can be smaller ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , metals are locked most likely into small - size dense fragments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where radiative cooling is efficient .",
    "it can result in a rapid cooling and compression and make such fragments to escape detection .",
    "dwarf satellites may add metals in the halo , though their contribution is apparently small because of low metallicity in their ism : @xmath187 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the difference between our calculations and the ones performed by @xcite , is that besides the haardt - madau extragalactic radiation field used in @xcite we add the galactic contribution , which as we showed above may have crucial consequences : the excess of photons with @xmath189  ev from the underlying stellar population competes the extragalactic radiation , while x - ray photons in the excess with @xmath136  ev substantially enhance ovi fraction ( section 3.2 ) .     for the fiducial column densities",
