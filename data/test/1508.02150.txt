    "the quantum vacuum is a fundamental concept in theoretical physics and its properties has been widely investigated in the literature of quantum gravity and string theory .",
    "the theory of quantum fields in curved spacetime which is believed to be the low energy limit of the ultimate theory of quantum gravity , has predicted famous quantum effects in the presence of gravity . in general , due to the lack of the global symmetries in the spacetime manifold , quantum effect considerations in curved spacetime are mainly limited to the analysis of the local quantities such as the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor , i.e. @xmath0 , in some point @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the most famous results of the semi - classical theory of gravity like the hawking radiation and the particle production in the expanding universe has been achieved from the analysis of the @xmath2 in the related curved backgrounds .",
    "the most famous vacuum state effect is the casimir effect .",
    "an important aspect in the researches around the casimir effect in curved spacetime is that the characteristics of the vacuum state are apparently dependent to the geometry of the background spacetime .",
    "we are also motivated to see explicitly such a dependency in this paper .",
    "furthermore , computation of the energy , i.e. @xmath3 , has also been done for large number of problems in various spacetimes and sometimes @xcite has helped us to confirm the validity of the principle of correspondence in the context of the casimir effect . finding the total gravitational force on a set of two conducting casimir plates @xcite is a typical example .",
    "so , due to the importance of the stress - energy tensor , we will consider the @xmath2 for the plates in a general weak background .",
    "the casimir effect arises when there is a boundary in our problem and it predicts a force between two uncharged conducting metals in the presence of a quantum field .",
    "the effect has been measured to a great accuracy @xcite .",
    "we use the zero - point energy approach here although it is possible to find the casimir force and energy without any reference to the zero - point energy @xcite .",
    "we may also have the casimir effect without having a boundary at all .",
    "in fact , some non - trivial topologies in curved spacetime do the same job as a boundary does@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the casimir energy in curved spacetime has been also analysed by many authors ( @xcite and references there in ) . recently ,",
    "a casimir apparatus consisting of two ideal conducting parallel plates in the weak field limit of the kerr and the horava - lifshitz spacetimes has been studied in @xcite .",
    "a purpose of this paper is to generalize the above analysis for scalar field doing exact solution of the klein - gordon equation in a general weak gravitational field .",

    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii using the fact that the apparatus has composed of tiny pales , we will find the small deviations of the metric from flat spacetime inside the apparatus .",
    "in fact we will expand the metric up to first order in terms of the parameters of the general weak gravitational field .",
    "in section iii the klein - gordon equation will be solved exactly inside the apparatus using the metric obtained in the previous section . in section",
    "iv mode frequencies inside the apparatus will be obtained under the influence of both dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions for the scalar field .",
    "generalization to the case where the electromagnetic field is present will be done using an interesting property of the fermi spacetime in section v. computation of the energy momentum tensor for the scalar field for both neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions are done in section vi .",

    "in the 1 + 3 formalism of general relativity , stationary spacetime metric is defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the so called gravitomagnetic potential and @xmath6 in the weak field slowly rotating limit ( @xmath7 ) , the metric ( [ eq01 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath8 the explicit form of a general weak gravitational field line element is as follows ( see ( 19.13 ) in @xcite ) @xmath9dt^2-[4\\epsilon_{ijk}s^j\\frac{x^k}{r^3}+o(\\frac{1}{r^3})]dx^idt \\\\ & -\\{(1+\\frac{2m}{r}+\\frac{3m^2}{2r^2})\\delta_{ij}+gravitational\\;radiation\\ ; terms\\;that\\;die\\ ; out\\ ; as\\ ; o(\\frac{1}{r } ) \\}dx^i dx^j , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparison between ( [ eq03 ] ) and ( [ eq04 ] ) shows that @xmath10 is the newtonian potential , @xmath11 is the gravitomagnetic potential and @xmath12 .",

    "fig : apparatus ] demonstrates the apparatus in a weak gravitational field .",
    "two ideal conducting plates are in a small coordinate distance @xmath13 from each other . inside the plates ,",
    "the metric has a small variation relative to the flat spacetime metric . to find this variation ,",
    "we adapt a rectangular coordinate system having the origin at one of the plates ( the one which is closer to the source and have coordinate distance @xmath14 from it ) and expand the metric ( [ eq04 ] ) inside the apparatus in the neighborhood of the point @xmath15 .",
    "the overall size of the apparatus is so small that we can assume @xmath16 : @xmath17 in which @xmath18 . for the case of a static spacetime , the components of the metric ( [ eq05 ] )",

    "so ( [ eq05]),([eq06 ] ) are also valid for the case of the far field limit of the kerr spacetime and we will back to it in the examples in the section vi .    motivated by the above discussion , in this paper we analyse the general case of the spacetime of the form @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath26 .    to solve the klein - gordon equation , it is better to recast the metric ( [ eq07 ] ) to the known fermi metric .",
    "we use the linearized weak field regime of general relativity and change the variables with the aid of the following gauge transformation : @xmath27 which we have assumed @xmath28 to force the spatial sector of the metric ( [ eq07 ] ) to be flat .",

    "in fact according to the last equation in ( [ eq08 ] ) the boundaries must be transformed from @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the spacetime ( [ eq07 ] ) to @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the spacetime ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "another change that the gauge transformation brings into the problem is the rescaling of time in ( [ eq09 ] ) by the factor @xmath36 .",
    "this corresponds , in turn , to dividing the mode frequencies @xmath37 by @xmath36 because of the presence of the factor @xmath38 in our solution of the klein - gordon equation in the next section .",

    "as stated in the previous section , the final mode frequencies will be obtained by multiplication of the factor @xmath36 due to rescaling of time during the gauge transformation ( [ eq09 ] ) .",
    "so we have the final mode frequencies inside the casimir apparatus for the spacetime ( [ eq07 ] ) : @xmath79 mode frequencies are influenced only by @xmath80 component of the metric from the point of view of a proper observer .",
