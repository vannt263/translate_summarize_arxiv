    "the optical system is among the most popular physical systems for implementing quantum computation .",
    "this is mainly due to the facts that light quantum states are generally more robust against decoherence than most massive qubit systems , and that the computation programs can be implemented by simple optical elements plus photodetections . in addition",
    ", all - optical quantum computation can be combined with quantum communication without qubit interconversion . in all - optical quantum information processing ( qip ) , the qubits are usually encoded by single - photon polarization states ( other types of photonic qubits can be usually converted to polarization qubits by optical apparatuses ) .",
    "parametric down - conversion can produce polarization - entangled photon pairs and heralded single photons .",
    "beam splitters ( bss ) and wave plates can be used to accomplish arbitrary single - qubit rotations . to complete a universal gate set for quantum computation ,",
    "the key point that is then needed is an appropriate two - qubit quantum gate , such as a two - qubit parity gate @xcite from which a controlled - not ( cnot ) gate can be readily constructed @xcite .",
    "note that a universal gate set can also serve many quantum communication protocols , in that it can be utilized to implement their required entangled - state joint measurements and entangled - channel generations .    to implement a photonic two - qubit gate ,",
    "nonlinear interactions between individual photons are required .",
    "linear optical elements plus photodetections can induce effective nonlinear photon interactions in principle .",
    "this way , however , is nondeterministic , and needs consuming substantial ancillary photon resources for achieving a high efficiency @xcite , which is the main obstacle to large - scale qip with linear optics .",
    "the required optical nonlinearity can also be achieved directly using a cross - kerr medium that can be described by an interaction hamiltonian of the form @xmath0 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) are , respectively , the annihilation ( creation ) operators of modes @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the strength of the nonlinearity . transforming the mode @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) using this hamiltonian will induce a phase shift that depends on the number of photons in the mode @xmath6 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "indeed , the mode transformations of the two beams are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the interaction time .",
    "when @xmath12 , a two - photon controlled - phase gate is naturally implemented , from which a cnot gate can also be easily constructed . with the giant cross - kerr phase shift ( xkps ) , many schemes for realizing optical quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurements , photonic quantum gates , optical entangled states , and quantum communication protocols have been proposed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , even the largest natural xknl is extremely weak .",
    "operating in the single - photon regime with a mode volume of about 0.1 @xmath13 , the xkps is only @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this makes cross - kerr - based optical quantum gates and qip extremely challenging . to obtain a giant xkps",
    ", one can in principle lengthen the cross - kerr interaction time by manufacturing a long fiber with the cross - kerr materials @xcite . in this case , however , photon losses and self - phase modulation in the cross - kerr medium will prevent the gate from operating properly @xcite . since the end of last century , much effort has been made to generate larger xknls using electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although considerable progress has been made , the experimentally available xknl still can not satisfy the requirement @xcite .",
    "recently , nemoto and munro @xcite proposed a scheme for realizing a nearly deterministic two - photon parity gate with weak xknls , in which the nonlinearity effect is ` amplified ' by an intense coherent state bus .",
    "thereafter , similar schemes for implementing photonic two - qubit parity and cnot gates were developed @xcite .",
    "all these schemes involve a building block of successive cross - kerr interactions between an intense coherent state probe beam  that acts as a quantum information bus  and a pair of single - photon qubit beams . to make these schemes work in the regime of @xmath15 , giant intensities of coherent states or rounds of operations ( each round involves two cross - kerr interactions ) are required . these requirements",
    ", however , are very difficult to achieve in the experiment , or even go beyond the reasonability .",
    "in addition , it is still an experimental challenge to achieve such a value of xkps .",
    "this idea has also been widely employed in the research on the bell - state measurement , generation of entangled states and coherent state superpositions , and so on ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme for realizing near deterministically a photonic two - qubit parity gate using a tiny xknl .",
    "the involved xknl can be several orders of magnitude weaker than the aforementioned schemes .",
    "the scheme employs an optical device based on a high quality ring cavity coupled to an external traveling wave ( signal mode ) through a cross - kerr medium @xcite .",
    "the cavity mode is fed by a coherent state and serves as a probe , and the detection outcomes at the cavity output ports reveal the parity ( even parity or odd parity ) of the two qubits without destroying the photons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the idea of performing a two - qubit parity gate with a tiny xknl . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the effects of some nonideal cases on the parity gate : sec .",
    "iii a focuses on the imperfection of the detectors , and sec .",
    "iii b on the photon losses of the coherent state bus . finally , concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "the schematic setup of realizing the two - qubit parity gate is depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "for simplicity , we suppose that the two beam splitters ( bss ) have the same transmissivity @xmath16 and their absorptions are negligible .",
    "the cavity is fed by a coherent state @xmath17 in the input mode @xmath18 , whereas the input mode @xmath19 is left unexcited . after passing through the polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) @xmath20 ,",
    "each of the two polarized photons will be in one of the path modes @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which depends on their polarization states . the mode @xmath21 ( signal mode )",
    "is coupled to the cavity mode through the cross - kerr medium .",
    "the two output ports of the cavity are monitored , respectively , by the photon - number resolving ( pnr ) detectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( when a certain condition is satisfied , @xmath24 can be omitted as shown later ) .",
    "@xmath25 serves as separating the two photons into different spatial modes .     and @xmath25 are two polarizing beam splitters , which transmit the horizontal polarization component and reflect the vertical component .",
    "two bss with low transmissivity @xmath16 and two mirrors ( m ) constitute a ring cavity which is fed by a coherent state in the mode @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath26 is a cross - kerr medium by which every photon in the mode @xmath21 induces a phase shift @xmath27 on the coherent state .",
    "@xmath28 is a static phase shifter that puts a phase shift @xmath29 on the coherent state .",
    "the cavity transmissivity and reflectivity are dependent on the phase shift on the coherent state .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are two photon - number resolving detectors , and their detection outcomes reveal the parity ( even parity or odd parity ) of the two qubits without destroying the photons .",

    "then the input state of the total system is @xmath40 according to eq .",
    "( [ transformation ] ) , we can obtain the output state of the total system , @xmath41    now we consider the two - qubit parity gate .",
    "assume that two polarization qubits are initially in the state @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the horizontal and vertical polarizations , respectively .",
    "this state may be separable or entangled depending on whether they have interacted previously . because the pbss transmit the horizontal polarization component and reflect the vertical component , after passing through @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) the incident state becomes @xmath45 it can be seen that there is only one photon in each path mode ( called balanced ) for the initial state @xmath46 or @xmath47 , while there are two photons in one path mode and none in the other ( called bunched ) for the initial state @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "the mode @xmath21 is then coupled to the cavity mode through a cross - kerr medium , as shown in fig .  1 . the subsequent @xmath25 is used to separate the two photons into different spatial modes . according to eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) , the whole system will be finally in the state @xmath50 we observe immediately from eq .",
    "( [ parameter ] ) that @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath51 and @xmath52 means the cavity being at resonance and having unit transmissivity @xcite .",
    "thus the state of eq .",
    "( [ out ] ) reduces to @xmath55 for implementing the two - qubit parity gate , that is , obtaining the even parity state ( non - normalized ) @xmath56 from @xmath57 and @xmath58 , but not ( even in principle ) distinguish @xmath57 from @xmath58 .",
    "it will be shown that this task can be accomplished by detecting the photon numbers of the modes @xmath30 and @xmath31 with the pnr detectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the indistinguishability between @xmath59 and @xmath60 with photon - number detection is evident .",
    "the same is true of the indistinguishability between @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for distinguishing @xmath63 from @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    ", we in fact only need to distinguish @xmath64 from @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "it will be shown later that the photon - number detection on the mode @xmath31 is just for removing the relative phase shift between the two components of the odd parity state .",
    "the overlap between @xmath59 and @xmath64 is very small and negligible if the amplitude @xmath65 is large enough , and they can be well distinguished from each other .",
    "the lower limit of @xmath66 depends on the quantum efficiency of the detector @xmath23 and the allowable error rate . for clarity , we first assume both @xmath23 and @xmath24 have unity quantum efficiency , and the imperfect case will be discussed later",
    ". then a measurement on the mode @xmath31 projects the two qubits and the mode @xmath31 in the state ( non - normalized ) @xmath67 , or ( non - normalized ) @xmath68 for @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and the identities @xmath72 and @xmath73 have been utilized .",
    "we have used the approximate equality ( @xmath74 ) in eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) as there is a small but finite probability that the state ( [ o ] ) can also occur for @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath76 ( without loss of generality , we shall take the same value in the following context ) , the probability of this error occurring is given by @xmath77 which is less than @xmath78 when @xmath79 .",
    "thus , @xmath59 and @xmath64 can be discriminated near deterministically .",
    "experimental implementations of discriminating between a coherent state and a vacuum state using the photon - number measurement have been recently reported @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that for the measurement outcome @xmath75 the mode @xmath31 is disentangled and the two qubits are directly projected in the even parity state of eq .",
    "( [ even ] ) .",
    "however , for @xmath69 the two qubits are still entangled with the mode @xmath31 . to disentangle the mode @xmath31 , one needs to perform another photon - number measurement on @xmath31 and obtain its photon number @xmath80 .",
    "then one obtains an odd parity state with the two components picking up an unwanted relative phase shift @xmath81 .",
    "the phase shift @xmath81 can be eliminated via a classical feedforward operation ( in many computational circuits the phase - shift removing operations can be delayed and performed at the final measurement stage for the qubits ) .",
    "after all the operations discussed above , we can conclude that a two - qubit parity gate is accomplished with near one probability .    as shown above , detecting the mode @xmath30 is sufficient for discriminating between the odd and even parities of the two qubits , and detecting @xmath31 is just for removing the relative phase shift of the two odd parity components @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "when @xmath84 is very small , the mean photon number ( @xmath85 ) of the states @xmath86 and @xmath87 is close to zero .",
    "then one may omit the detection of @xmath31 .",
    "this , however , will yield a small error probability given by @xmath88 which is less than @xmath89 when @xmath90 .    in what follows ,",
    "we analyze how large xkps ( @xmath27 ) is required for realizing the aforementioned parity gate . for a certain value of @xmath91 , the value of @xmath27 evidently depends on the values of @xmath92 and @xmath16 . what we are interested in is the weak nonlinearity regime ( i.e. , @xmath93 ) .",
    "in addition , we assume the transmissivity ( @xmath16 ) of the bss is also very small .",
    "then , @xmath94 and @xmath95 can be approximated as @xmath96 where @xmath97 . according to eqs .",
    "( [ error ] ) and ( [ approximate ] ) , the relationship of @xmath98 and @xmath92 is given by @xmath99 evidently , @xmath98 decreases ( i.e. , @xmath27 decreases for a given @xmath16 ) as @xmath92 increases for a certain value of @xmath91 , and vice versa .",
    "when @xmath91 and @xmath92 are given ( i.e. , @xmath98 is given ) , @xmath27 is in inverse proportion to @xmath100 .",
    "these results imply that our scheme can work in the regime of tiny xknl .",
    "we take @xmath101 as an example .",
    "then the dependence relation of @xmath98 and @xmath92 is shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath92 slowly increases as @xmath98 rapidly decreases in the range @xmath102 , while @xmath92 rapidly increases as @xmath98 slowly decreases in the range @xmath103 .",
    "this indicates that a large decrease in @xmath27 only needs a small increase in @xmath92 for the case @xmath104 , while a small decrease in @xmath27 needs a large increase in @xmath92 for the case @xmath105 .",
    "thus there is a trade - off between @xmath27 and @xmath92 . in the following context ,",
    "we focus on an example case , @xmath106 .",
    "then the lower @xmath16 is , the smaller regime of @xmath27 our scheme can work in . for example , when @xmath16 is of the order of @xmath107 ( these values are available under current technology @xcite ) , @xmath27 is correspondingly of the order of @xmath107 .",
    "it seems that the previous schemes can also work in the regime of these orders of magnitude of xkps by increasing the amplitude of the probe coherent state or the number of round .",
    "however , the intensity of the coherent state or the number of round would go beyond the accessible or even reasonable values .",
    "for example , to make the parity gate operate properly even for @xmath108 ( assuming the error probability is also of the order of @xmath78 ) , the amplitude of the probe coherent state should be @xmath109 in refs .",
    "@xcite ( note that a much more intense ancillary coherent state beam is also required for accomplishing the homodyne measurement on the probe coherent state beam @xcite ) , and the number of round ( each round involves two cross - kerr interactions ) should also be @xmath109 in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although the amplitude of the probe coherent state can be reduced to a certain extent by using photon - number measurement than homodyne measurement @xcite , inaccessibly or even unreasonably intense ancillary coherent state would be required for accomplishing an appropriate displacement on the probe coherent state .",
    "thus we conclude that our scheme can work in the regime of a several orders of magnitude weaker xknl than those schemes mentioned above .     and @xmath98 , with the error probability @xmath101.,width=340,height=226 ]",

    "@xmath123 is small if and only if @xmath124 is small .",
    "when @xmath125 , @xmath123 is less than @xmath126 .",
    "in addition , for a given value of @xmath127 , the larger @xmath92 is , the larger @xmath123 becomes .",
    "thus , for making @xmath123 be very small , the quantum efficiency is required to be very high when @xmath92 is not very small .",
    "fortunately , recent reports @xcite indicated that @xmath127 could be close to unity with the developing techniques .",
    "we notice that potential dark counts of the detectors could also cause errors .",
    "however , recent experiments @xcite demonstrated that near - unity - efficiency pnr detectors with negligible dark - count rates could be produced .",
    "note that other schemes @xcite may be more fragile to the imperfection of the detectors , because they involve photon - number measurements on very intense coherent states as mentioned before .",
    "it is worth stressing that @xmath128 is not the error probability of distinguishing between the odd and even parities of the two qubits but the error probability of removing the relative phase shift of the two odd parity components .",
    "the error probability ( @xmath129 ) of distinguishing the odd parity components @xmath130 and @xmath131 from the even parity components @xmath132 and @xmath133 could be close to zero even when the detection efficiency is low ( in the following context , we shall use the abbreviation @xmath134 ) . therefore ,",
    "even with low - efficiency detectors , our scheme could be used to implement the bell - state measurement with near unity probability @xcite and generate cluster states with a certain probability @xcite as well as serve all other quantum tasks that involve two - photon polarization - parity detections .",
    "it has been mentioned before that when @xmath84 is very small ( e.g. , @xmath135 and @xmath92 is not too large ) , the measurement on the mode @xmath31 may well be omitted . then the error probability @xmath128 vanishes .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the decoherence effect due to photon absorption in the cross - kerr medium .",
    "photon losses may occur in both the bus and the qubit modes .",
    "however , photon losses in the coherent state field is more easier to occur .",
    "therefore , photon losses of the coherent state field should be the main source of decoherence in the two - qubit output state when the interaction time is very short @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we shall consider the photon losses in the bus .",
    "such photon losses can be modeled via a beam splitter of transmissivity @xmath136 which discards a portion of the coherent state beam @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath136 does not vary with time and can be measured in advance through suitable test experiments @xcite , so its value is known .",

    "<S> the cross - kerr nonlinearity ( xknl ) effect can induce efficient photon interactions in principle with which photonic multiqubit gates can be performed using far fewer physical resources than linear optical schemes . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , it is extremely challenging to generate giant cross - kerr nonlinearities . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , much effort has been made to perform multiqubit gates via weak xknls . </S>",
    "<S> however , the required nonlinearity strengths are still difficult to achieve in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we here propose an xknl - based scheme for realizing a two - photon polarization - parity gate , a universal two - qubit gate , in which the required strength of the nonlinearity could be orders of magnitude weaker than those required for previous schemes . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme utilizes a ring cavity fed by a coherent state as a quantum information bus which interacts with a path mode of the two polarized photons ( qubits ) . </S>",
    "<S> the xknl effect makes the bus pick up a phase shift dependent on the photon number of the path mode . even when the potential phase shifts are very small they can be effectively measured using photon - number resolving detectors , which accounts for the fact that our scheme can work in the regime of tiny xknl . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement outcome reveals the parity ( even parity or odd parity ) of the two polarization qubits . </S>"
