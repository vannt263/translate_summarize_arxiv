    "as modern control systems increasingly rely on information and communication technology ( ict ) infrastructures to exchange real - time measurements and actuator signals , their exposure to malicious cyber threats also grows : each measurement and actuator signal may be compromised and altered by a skillful cyber adversary .",
    "therefore , cyber security and resilience with respect to attacks are important properties of modern control systems that are tightly coupled to ict infrastructures .",
    "some of the main challenges in designing cyber - secure control systems are related to : analyzing the risk of cyber attacks ; devising protection mechanisms to prevent and remove high - risk threats ; and also to timely detect and mitigate on - going attacks . while the first two challenges relate to conventional ict cyber security approaches ( _ i.e. , _ risk management  @xcite ) , the third approach is closely related to the well - known control field of fault diagnosis .",
    "although both relate to detecting anomalies , there exist subtle differences between classical fault diagnosis and attack detection in cyber security .",
    "classical control - theoretic approaches to anomaly detection ( _ e.g. , _ fault detection , isolation , and identification ) typically deal with independent disturbances and faults ; thus they typically do not consider possibly colluding malicious cyber attacks , which may even attempt to hide the attacks by mimicking physical disturbances and faults .",
    "in fact , this paper addresses the latter scenario , discussing detectability conditions of sparse attacks that may be masked by plausible disturbances , and connecting the results to fundamental limitations well - known in the controls literature , in terms of fault detection and identification  @xcite and input reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "the topic of cyber - secure control systems has been receiving increasing attention recently .",
    "an overview of existing cyber threats and vulnerabilities in networked control systems is presented in @xcite .",
    "rational adversary models are highlighted as one of the key items in security for control systems , thus making adversaries endowed with intelligence and intent , as opposed to faults .",
    "therefore , these adversaries may exploit existing vulnerabilities and limitations in the traditional anomaly detection mechanisms and remain undetected , or indistinguishable from disturbances and process noise .",
    "in fact ,  @xcite uses such fundamental limitations to characterize a set of undetectable attack policies for networked systems modeled by differential - algebraic equations . related undetectable attack policies",
    "were also considered in @xcite .",
    "a common thread within these approaches is that undetectable attacks are constrained to be entirely decoupled from the anomaly detector s output .",
    "detectability conditions of undetectable false - data injection attacks to control systems are closely examined in  @xcite , where it is shown that mismatches between the system s and the attack policy s initial conditions may lead to detectable attacks .",
    "additionally , modifications to the system dynamics , input , and output matrices that reveal stealthy data attacks were also characterized .",
    "other work has analyzed undetectable attacks with respect to the amount of effort they require , _",
    "i.e. , _ the number of attack signals that must be injected by the adversary to remain undetected .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , such analysis provides insight into the likelihood of such attacks occurring , which is a core component of determining the risk ( _ i.e. , _ impact and likelihood ) of such threat scenarios .    for static systems ,  @xcite",
    "first proposed a security index for measurement attacks , which corresponds to the minimum number of measurements that need to be corrupted as to ensure undetectability .",
    "the computation of the security index involves solving an np - hard problem , in general , which has later been investigated by  @xcite . under certain structures of the problem ,",
    "this work proposed efficient algorithms to compute the security index in polynomial time .",
    "related problems have been investigated for dynamical systems .",
    "the work in  @xcite characterizes the number of corrupted sensor channels that can not be detected during a finite time - interval . for sensor attacks that can be detected , a resilient state estimation scheme inspired by compressed sensing",
    "is proposed .",
    "the work in  @xcite explored the notion of strong observability to characterize the conditions for which the initial state can be recovered under the presence of sparse unknown input signals . for sensor attack scenarios",
    ", @xcite determines the smallest number of sensors needed for undetectable attacks . the notion of security index for dynamical system under sensor and actuator attacks",
    "was also extended to dynamical systems at steady - state and for finite - time intervals in  @xcite .",
    "this work investigates the notion of security index for dynamical systems under both attacks and disturbances .",
    "in particular , we consider the case where attacks are said to be undetectable if they can be masked ( explained ) by a disturbance signal .",
    "the formulation of the security index is related to well - known limitations in the fault detection literature , and the complexity of computing these indices for special cases is discussed and related to the literature . for detectable attacks , the concept of identifiable attacks is defined , as well as a weaker notion of identifiability where only certain entries of the attack signal can be uniquely determined .",
    "connections between these definitions and the security index are investigated , based on which attacks with sufficiently high sparsity are shown to be identifiable . finally , for identifiable attacks , an attack reconstruction procedure is proposed .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "the dynamical system under the influence of disturbances and attacks is described in section  [ sec : prel ] , where undetectable attacks , potentially masked by disturbances , are defined .",
    "section  [ sec : index ] formulates the security index for dynamical systems under the influence of both disturbances and attacks , and discusses important special cases and their connection to the literature .",
    "the role of security indices in ( possibly partial ) attack identification under disturbances is examined in section  [ sec : identification ] , whereas concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .      for a set @xmath0",
    ", @xmath1 denotes its cardinality . for a vector @xmath2",
    ", we denote its @xmath3-th element by @xmath4 .",
    "by @xmath5 , we mean a vector whose @xmath3-th element is non - zero , _",
    "@xmath6 , and the other elements are arbitrary .",
    "the support of @xmath2 , @xmath7 , is the set of indices @xmath3 where @xmath6 , and @xmath8 is the number of non - zero elements in @xmath9 .",
    "similar notations are used for discrete - time signals @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 a discrete - time linear system @xmath12 has a rational proper transfer matrix @xmath13 of dimension @xmath14 .",
    "we also define @xmath15 : = \\max_z { { \\mathrm{rank}\\,}}[g(z)]$ ] .",
    "let us consider the discrete - time system @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with a realization @xmath19 for times @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the state vector , @xmath22 are unknown disturbance ( or fault ) signals , @xmath23 are potential attack signals , and @xmath24 are the measurements available to the operator of the system .",
    "additionally , we assume to have distinct measurement , attack , and disturbances signals , in the sense that @xmath25 = p. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it turns out that the value of the initial state , @xmath26 , is important in the following , but initially we will let it be a free variable .",
    "the system model is similar to those studied in the fault detection and diagnosis literature , see , _",
    "@xcite . the signals @xmath27 and @xmath9 represent different types of anomalies that can occur in the system , although of different nature . we next want to determine when we can detect and distinguish between these anomalies . we could think of @xmath27 as natural disturbances , or faults , that are to be expected , and that have no malicious intent .",
    "they could represent measurement and process noise , for example .",
    "one important aspect is that a malicious attacker could use such disturbances to hide his or her attack @xmath9 from being seen in the output @xmath28",
    ". we will typically let @xmath27 be a free variable , where the only available knowledge about the disturbance signals amounts to their signature matrices , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "thus , to ensure robustness with respect to disturbances , an anomaly detection algorithm wishing to detect potential attack signals must be designed so that it is decoupled from @xmath29 and @xmath30 . under this disturbance model",
    ", we check whether a disturbance exists that will `` mask '' the attack .",
    "if this is the case , the operator is not able to distinguish between attacks and disturbances , and can not conclude whether an attack is present , or not .",
    "naturally , several other disturbance models exist , such as assuming known upper bounds on the disturbance signal s energy or instantaneous peak , or constraining the disturbance to belong to a given class of signals , _",
    "e.g. , _ constant or sinusoidal signals . in particular , the results in this paper can be straightforwardly extended to disturbances modeled as the output of an autonomous discrete - time system @xmath31 which is parametrized by a free initial condition @xmath32",
    ".    the attack can potentially occur in @xmath33 different locations in the system ( @xmath34 ) , and we will be concerned about the possibility for the operator with access to the above model and the signal @xmath28 to detect an attack signal @xmath35 .",
    "we make the following definitions to formalize these ideas .",
    "an attack signal @xmath9 is _ persistent _ when @xmath36 as @xmath37 .    in this paper , we are mainly concerned with persistent attacks , since they have non - vanishing impact .",
    "a ( persistent ) attack signal @xmath9 is    * _ undetectable _ if there exists a simultaneous ( masking ) disturbance signal @xmath27 and initial state @xmath26 such that @xmath38 , @xmath39 ; * _ asymptotically undetectable _ if there exists a simultaneous ( masking ) disturbance signal @xmath27 and initial state @xmath26 such that @xmath40 , @xmath37 .",
    "note that the definition of undetectable attacks is the same as in  @xcite , if we assume there are no disturbances in the system  .",
    "the reason for calling the disturbance `` masking '' comes from linearity of the system : if @xmath41 , then clearly @xmath42 , and it is impossible to in the output distinguish between the undetectable attack and the masking disturbance , if they occur by themselves without the other",
    ".    we will next be interested in quantifying the minimal resources needed by the attacker to achieve undetectability , when he or she want to target a specific attack element @xmath4 , @xmath43 .",
    "hence , we will search for sparse signals @xmath44 satisfying the above conditions .",
    "for an attack signal @xmath9 to be undetectable , we need to ensure there exists a masking disturbance @xmath27 and an initial state @xmath26 resulting in zero output .",
    "existence of such a signal can easily be checked by considering the matrix pencil ( the rosenbrock system matrix ) @xmath45 see  @xcite .",
    "an attack signal @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , is undetectable iff there exists @xmath49 and @xmath50 such that @xmath51 _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath52 should not have full column rank .",
    "the undetectable attack is also persistent iff @xmath53 .",
    "note that , if the initial state @xmath54 , the attack signal @xmath46 may actually be detectable . following the analysis in  @xcite ,",
    "if @xmath55 is schur ( @xmath56 ) , the attack signal is only _ asymptotically _ undetectable , since there will be a vanishing transient visible in the output .",
    "this transient can be made arbitrarily small by the attacker choosing @xmath57 small .",
    "hence , the difference between asymptotically undetectable and undetectable attacks may not be very large in practice .    if the attacker would like to target the element @xmath3 , _",
    "@xmath58 , and remain undetected , he or she needs to find a vector @xmath59 satisfying . in general , this may require the attacker to target several elements @xmath60 , @xmath61 . to measure the minimal number of elements required to achieve this , we introduce the following _ security index _",
    "@xmath62 , which generalizes a concept first introduced for non - dynamical systems in @xcite : @xmath63 note that for all @xmath3 it holds @xmath64 , and if there is no feasible solution , we define @xmath65 note also that this is a combinatorial optimization problem , because of the objective function @xmath66 , and in general is hard to solve  @xcite .",
    "however , in several cases of interest , it has a simple solution , as discussed below .",
    "we can think of the signals @xmath67 resulting from as the sparsest possible persistent undetectable attacks against an element @xmath3 .",
    "these signals should be of interest to both the operator and the attacker , in the sense that they show how the attacker can modify the solutions to the system equations  , without modifying the measurable output @xmath28 . also , if the number @xmath62 is large , it indicates that it will require significant coordinated resources by the attacker to accomplish undetectable attacks against @xmath4 .",
    "an operator can thus use the index in performing a quantitative risk assessment , as illustrated in , _",
    "the index @xmath62 also has implications for the possibility of the operator to reconstruct ( `` identify '' ) a detectable attack @xmath44 , as will be further explored in section  [ sec : identification ] .",
    "there are some concepts in the literature that are similar to @xmath62 above . in power system observability analysis ,",

    "@xcite . for sensor attack scenarios",
    ", @xcite determines the smallest number of sensors needed for undetectable attacks .",

    "also , in @xcite , an optimization problem related to was studied .",
    "some further connections are made in the special cases considered in the following subsections .",
    "a particularly serious situation is when @xmath70 , since the attacker then can target element @xmath3 undetected without the need to access any other resources .",

    "an even more serious situation occurs when @xmath76 = { { \\mathrm{normalrank}\\,}}[p_i(z ) ] .",
    "\\label{eq : seriousrank}\\ ] ] if this easily checked condition is fulfilled , it is possible to find an undetectable attack signal @xmath77 of cardinality one , using any complex frequency @xmath78 .",
    "note that holds when there are many disturbances in relation to the number of available measurements , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath79 .",
    "if the rosenbrock system matrix @xmath80 has full column normal rank and the realization is minimal , the only solutions to that exist correspond to the system s finite number of transmission zeros , see , _ e.g. , _ @xcite . hence , to find @xmath62 we only need to inspect the corresponding system zero directions . when the zero directions are all one - dimensional , the computation of @xmath62 becomes especially simple .",
    "generically , one would expect the zero directions to be one - dimension , but there are several interesting situations where this is not the case , as we shall see below ( although these will be invariant zeros , and not transmission zeros ) .",
    "the situation where the system is subjected to sensor attacks have received particular interest in the literature , see , _",
    "e.g. , _ @xcite . in this case",
    "we have @xmath81 , and in we only need to consider @xmath82 , _",
    "i.e. , _ the eigenvalues of @xmath55 , where @xmath83 are eigenvectors of @xmath55 . if the eigenvalues are simple , the eigenspace corresponding to each eigenvalue is one - dimensional , and again the computation of @xmath62 is simplified .    as a further special case ,",
    "suppose all sensors are potentially attackable and there are no disturbances , and so @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "also suppose that the operator has high redundancy in the system in the sense that the realization is observable using any one of the outputs @xmath86 , @xmath87 , by itself .",
    "considering the pbh test  @xcite , this means that any one of the eigenmodes @xmath88 is visible in all the sensors , and all elements in the vector @xmath89 are non - zero .",
    "thus an undetectable attack ( @xmath90 must involve all the signals in @xmath9 , and for all @xmath3 the security index must be @xmath91 ( or @xmath92 if @xmath55 is schur ) .",
    "hence , one way to make undetectable attacks hard is to install many redundant sensors , each of which with the individual power to observe the entire system state with little noise , which is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "if we assume @xmath93 , @xmath94 ( only sensors attacked ) , we have essentially recovered the original security index @xmath62 , as defined in @xcite .",
    "the motivation for the index there was to quantify the vulnerability of power system state estimators to false data injection attacks .",
    "note that because @xmath93 and @xmath81 , this problem only concerns systems in steady - state . perhaps one would think that this makes the problem easier , but in fact the problem can be significantly harder in practice .",
    "this is because the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to the sole eigenvalue is of dimension @xmath95 , and not one - dimensional as is frequently the case in the previous examples .",
    "intuitively , one can understand this since the attacker here has no constraints in time to fulfill and thus has many more options for being undetectable .",
    "this fact together with the potentially high dimension @xmath95 in a power system has spurred several investigations on the efficient computation of @xmath62 .",
    "the problem in general is np - hard  @xcite , but in the examples deriving from power systems the matrix @xmath96 has a useful structure that can be exploited . in particular , @xcite show how max - flow min - cut algorithms can be used to solve the problem in polynomial time . under slightly different assumptions on the structure of @xmath96 , @xcite shows how @xmath97-relaxation can also exactly solve the problem in polynomial time .",
    "in this section , we turn to the related problem of attack identification , which concerns the possibilities to reconstruct elements of an attack signal from the measured output .",
    "to formalize the attack identification problem , the following definitions are made .",
    "a ( persistent ) attack signal @xmath9 is    * _ identifiable _ if for all attack signals @xmath98 , and all corresponding disturbances @xmath27 and @xmath99 and initial states @xmath26 and @xmath100 , we have @xmath101 ; * _ asymptotically _ _ identifiable _ if for all attack signals @xmath102 , and all corresponding disturbances @xmath27 and @xmath99 and initial states @xmath26 and @xmath100 , we have @xmath103 , as @xmath37 .",
    "identifiable attack signals @xmath9 excite the output @xmath28 in a unique way that can not be achieved by any other attack @xmath104 .",
    "this is equivalent to the system possessing a certain left inverse , as will be explored in section  [ sec : decouple ] .",
    "note that identifiability of @xmath9 is a much stronger requirement than detectability of @xmath9 ( which means that the attack @xmath9 is such that @xmath105 for all disturbances @xmath27 and initial states @xmath26 ) .",
    "since identifiability is such a strong requirement , we will also be interested in the following weaker notion .",

    "identifiability is therefore the same as @xmath3-identifiability for all @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , there is a tight connection between detectability , identifiability , and the previously introduced security index .",

    "the problem is in fact essentially the same as in compressed sensing , see , _ e.g. , _ @xcite .",
    "finally , we remark that the procedure can be modified to handle attacks that are only @xmath3-identifiable , but the estimates @xmath181 will then only necessarily correctly identify element @xmath4 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied detectability and identifiability of attacks on dynamical systems that are also subjected to disturbances . for this purpose , we generalized the concept of security index , which was previously introduced for static systems in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the index exactly quantifies the resources necessary for targeted attacks to be undetectable and unidentifiable in the presence of disturbances .",
    "such information is relevant for both risk assessment and for the design of anomaly detectors .",
    "we also discussed how these concepts relate to recent other work on attack detection and identification .",
    "finally , we showed how techniques from the fault detection literature can be exploited to identify attacks under certain sparsity constraints ."
