    "v405 aur ( rx j0558.0 + 5353 ) was discovered in the rosat all - sky survey ( haberl et al . 1994 ) and was identified with a @xmath11 14.5 cataclysmic variable ( cv ) , showing characteristics of an intermediate polar ( ip ) : the soft x - ray flux was modulated at 272.7 s , which suggested that the system consists of a spinning magnetic white dwarf ( wd ) accreting matter from a cool low - mass companion .",
    "an orbital period of 4.15 h was deduced from optical spectroscopy .",
    "further analysis of the rosat data at energies higher than 0.7 kev revealed a period of 545 s , which is the true spin period of the wd , and therefore the soft x - ray light curve has a double - peaked structure ( allan et al .",
    "1996 ; evans & hellier 2004 ) .",
    "evidence of two - pole accretion has been found also from optical spectroscopy ( still et al .",
    "1998 ; harlaftis & horne 1999 ) .",
    "v405 aur belongs to a small group of ips which are unusually bright in soft x - rays , and have also been found to emit polarized radiation in the optical and/or near ir , resembling what we see in the strictly ( or nearly ) synchronous magnetic cvs , polars .",
    "the polarized ips known to date are bg cmi ( penning et al . 1986",
    "; west et al . 1987 ) , pq gem ( piirola et al . 1993 ; rosen et al . 1993 ; potter et al . 1997 ) , v2400 oph ( buckley et al .",
    "1997 ) , v405 aur ( shakhovskoy & kolesnikov 1997 ) , v2306 cyg ( uslenghi et al .",
    "2001 ; norton et al .",
    "2002 ) , and rx j2133.7 + 5107 ( katajainen et al . 2007 ) . of these ips ,",
    "pq gem was the first found to show spin - modulated circular and linear polarization variations , arising from cyclotron emission from two accretion regions near the opposite magnetic poles of the spinning wd .",
    "ips are generally believed to have lower magnetic field ( @xmath12 10 mg , see e.g. warner 1995 ) than polars , where the determined fields range from 7 mg ( v2301 oph , ferrario et al .",
    "1995 ) to 230 mg ( ar uma , schmidt et al .",
    "typical values for polars are a few tens of mg ( see cropper 1990 for a review ) , and the magnetic field is sufficiently high to prevent the formation of an accretion disk .",
    "the stream of matter from the companion is coupled to the magnetic field lines and channeled via accretion columns onto the wd surface . in ips accretion disk may exist , but is truncated at some inner radius where flow to the wd takes place via accretion curtains ( rosen et al . , 1988 ; ferrario et al . ,",
    "1993 ) .",
    "ips predominantly have longer orbital periods ( 4 - 5 h ) than polars ( typically @xmath13 2 h ) , though there is considerable overlap .",
    "close binaries lose angular momentum via gravitational radiation and magnetic wind braking , and therefore evolve towards shorter orbital periods .",
    "for sufficiently high field strengths and small binary separations the magnetic locking torque will start to spin - down the wd and synchronism may be reached , the system thus becoming a polar . for ips magnetic field measurements",
    "are difficult , but from polarized flux spectrum estimates have been made for pg gem ( 8 - 18 mg , piirola et al .",
    "1993 ; 9 - 21 mg , vth et al . 1996 ; potter et al .",
    "1997 ) , v2400 oph ( 9 - 20 mg , vth 1997 ) , and rx j2133.7 + 5107 ( @xmath14 20 mg , katajainen et al .",
    "these values are well within the range of the magnetic fields seen in polars and suggest that some of the polarized ips may evolve into polars .",
    "so far only one of the polarized ips , pq gem , has been shown to have the wd spinning down ( mason 1997 ) .    in the present paper",
    "we report extensive multicolour ( @xmath0 ) polarimetric observations of v405 aur , carried out in order to put constraints on the magnetic field strength of the wd and on the system geometry .",
    "these observations were complemented with low - resolution circular spectropolarimetry .",
    "we have also searched for possible spin period changes by a long - term monitoring of phase shifts in the circular polarization curves .",
    "broad - band multicolor polarimetry was carried out at the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) at roque de los muchachos observatory on la palma .",
    "the instrument ( turpol ) provides strictly simultaneous measurements in five passbands close to the @xmath0 system , by using four dichroic filters to split the light into the different spectral regions ( piirola 1988 ) . in the circular polarimetry mode the superachromatic quarter - wave ( @xmath154 ) plate",
    "was rotated in 90  steps above the plane - parallel calcite plate polarizing beam splitter . for each orientation of the retarder",
    ", the two polarized beams were integrated with a 25 hz chopping frequency for a 5 s total integration time each . with some dead time involved in the chopping procedure ,",
    "the resulting time resolution is about 12 s for photometry .",
    "one circular polarization observation consists of two integrations with the @xmath154 plate in orthogonal orientations , and the time resolution is correspondingly about 24 s. in the simultaneous linear and circular polarization mode the @xmath154 plate was rotated in 22.5  steps .",
    "one complete observation of linear and circular polarization consists of eight integrations , and the time resolution is correspondingly about 1.6 minutes . a summary of the polarization observations is given in table 1 .",

    "the polarimeter is equipped with a thinned back illuminated ccd ( marconi ) which has a high blue sensitivity .",
    "the time resolution of these observations is about 1 min .",

    "an achromatic @xmath154 plate was rotated in 90  steps above the slit by the polarimetry unit ( fapol ) , controlled via the alfosc user interface .",
    "a plane parallel calcite plate below the slit produced two perpendicularly polarized spectra on the ccd .",
    "the two polarized beams passed through the collimator , grism , and the camera onto the ccd . to improve time resolution ,",
    "circular polarization spectra were deduced from individual 120 s exposures .",
    "null calibration was done with the help of unpolarized standard stars .",
    "to check for the circular polarization sign and scale , observations of the highly polarized star grw+70 8247 were made .",
    "figure 1 illustrates our simultaneous @xmath0 circular polarimetry .",
    "the data collected on two different nights show nearly sinusoidal and remarkably symmetric modulation , with extreme values near @xmath33% in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and about @xmath32% in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands . in the @xmath18 band",
    "the modulation is smaller , about @xmath31% .",
    "this is the first time that polarization peaking in the _ blue _ has been detected in an ip , and suggests that v405 aur is the highest field ip discovered so far .",
    "its magnetic field is probably similar to what is typically found in polars ( 25 - 50 mg ) .",
    "nearly symmetric positive and negative excursions in the circular polarization curves indicate that two opposite magnetic poles ( positive and negative ) are accreting at similar rate in v405 aur .    the left hand panels in figure 1 show evidence of a small dip in circular polarization near phase 0.25 , where the positive magnetic pole points closest to us .",
    "this is due to cyclotron beaming effect .",
    "cyclotron emission intensity is at maximum in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field , and decreases to zero when looking along magnetic field lines .",
    "unpolarized background radiation from thermal sources dilutes the observed degree of circular polarization when the polarized cyclotron flux decreases .",
    "our simultaneous @xmath0 light curves in figure 2 show minima near the phases 0.25 and 0.75 where we are looking closest along the field lines , and maxima at the phases 0.0 and 0.5 where our line sight is perpendicular to the field lines , as seen from the zero - crossings of circular polarization .",
    "this photometric behaviour is in accordance with the cyclotron beaming effect , i.e. , maximum emission takes place in directions perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "many , but not all , polars show a pulse of linear polarization when our line of sight is nearly perpendicular to the field lines . we have found no evidence of any linear polarization pulse in v405 aur .",
    "linear polarization appears to be constant at the level of @xmath19 138@xmath3 4and is probably of interstellar origin .",
    "fitting the modified serkowski law for the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization ( whittet et al . 1992 ) to the average polarization in the @xmath0 bands gives maximum polarization @xmath20 = 0.44 @xmath3 0.04% , at @xmath21 = 0.56 @xmath3 0.11@xmath22 m .",

    "it is not possible to put strict constraints on the geometric model , which is defined basically by the inclination , @xmath30 , of the wd spin axis and the colatitude , @xmath31 , of the cyclotron emission region(s ) .",
    "this adds further uncertainty in the modeling of the cyclotron flux spectrum ( figure 4 ) , which is dependent on the angle between our line of sight and the magnetic field .",
    "the symmetric shape of the circular polarization curves over the wd spin period ( figure 1 ) requires that @xmath31 is large .",
    "this was noted already by shakhovskoy & kolesnikov ( 1997 ) , who suggested a nearly equatorial magnetic field in v405 aur .",
    "the small dip at the circular polarization maximum ( figure 1 , left panel ) indicates that when the emission region is pointing closest to us the viewing angle , @xmath32 , reaches a value where the beaming effect starts to reduce cyclotron flux , but does not yet drop it substantially .",
    "less clear evidence of a beaming effect is seen on the right hand panel of figure 1 suggesting that probably the emission region had moved slightly towards larger @xmath32 values , and consequently the observed cyclotron emission was less influenced by the beaming effect on that night .    with the above constraints from circular polarization curves ,",
    "we have tried to reproduce the observed polarization and light curves of v405 aur with a geometric model involving extended emission strips on the wd surface .",
    "we have applied the viewing angle dependence of the cyclotron flux polarization and intensity from wickramasinghe & meggitt ( 1985 ) , as done in the earlier work by piirola et al .",
    "( 1990 , 1993 , 1994 ) , where the models are also explained in more detail .",
    "the minimum total flux determined from each of the @xmath0 light curves was adopted as the wavelength dependent unpolarized background flux in the model computations .",
    "this is a good approximation as the relative amount of cyclotron emission in the total observed flux is small in v405 aur .",
    "centered , or slightly de - centered , dipole field was assumed for computing the direction of field lines relative to the normal to the wd surface for the emission arcs located off from the magnetic poles .",
    "the nearly symmetric rising and descending parts of the circular polarization curves suggest that the tilt of magnetic field lines with respect to the normal to the wd in the emission region is not large in the direction of longitude , i.e. , the cyclotron region is not located far from the magnetic pole in that direction .",
    "such accretion geometry may be favored in spin equilibrium case .",
    "in contrast , for pq gem potter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have found the cyclotron arc located _ ahead _ of the magnetic pole in longitude , which is consistent with the _ spin - down _ of the wd in this system .",
    "estimates from x - ray spectral fits ( evans & hellier 2004 ) give rather small values of the blackbody emitting area ( @xmath13 0.001 of the wd surface ) associated with the accretion region .",
    "hence , we assume relatively narrow cyclotron emission arcs in our model .",
    "the main features of the circular polarization and light curves can be reproduced reasonably well ( figures 5 and 6 ) , but the cyclotron flux from the constant temperature models drops too much when moving away from the wavelength of the peak polarized flux .",
    "hence , the amplitude of the circular polarization and intensity variations becomes too small for the @xmath16 and @xmath18 bands ( top and bottom panels , respectively ) .",
    "also the beaming effect , the dip of polarization at phases 0.25 and 0.75 , becomes too pronounced at high harmonics .",
    "producing a broader cyclotron flux spectrum would require inhomogeneous emission regions with spread in the physical parameters , the electron density , temperature , and the magnetic field .",
    "such modeling is , however , beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the results from our computations shown in figures 5 and 6 support the earlier suggestion by shakhovskoy & kolesnikov ( 1997 ) that the magnetic dipole axis is nearly equatorial in v405 aur ( figures 7 and 8) .",
    "with such a large value of the colatitude , @xmath33 90  , best fits to our circular polarization and light curves are obtained with the wd spin axis inclination in the range @xmath34 30 - 50 . to put better constraints on the system geometry of v405 aur , further efforts to establish possible variability of the linear polarization ( @xmath35 ) would be required .",
    "soft x - rays in polarized ips are dominated by blackbody emission from the heated wd surface near the accretion shock .",
    "the double - peaked structure of the soft x - ray light curve in v405 aur indicates that both accretion regions contribute .",
    "the equality of the two maxima requires that the angle between the magnetic and spin axes is high ( evans & hellier 2004 ) , as also suggested earlier by the circular polarization curve ( shakhovskoy & kolesnikov 1997 ) and our modeling in the present paper ( sect 3.2 ) .",
    "the details of the geometric model of evans & hellier ( 2004 ) from x - ray data are not fully supported by the circular polarization curves . with their values of spin and magnetic axis inclination ( @xmath30=65  and @xmath36=60 ) the upper magnetic pole passes near the center of the visible disk of the wd when pointing closest to us , and",
    "the corresponding viewing angles , @xmath37 0 would give prominent cyclotron beaming effects : circular polarization would drop to zero in all wavebands .",
    "our circular polarization curves ( figure 1 ) show only minor depressions at phases 0.25 and 0.75 in the @xmath16 band and marginal evidence in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands , suggesting that the viewing angle , @xmath38 40  throughout the spin cycle .",
    "the symmetric polarization and light curves require the two accretion regions be nearly at the _ same _ latitude .",
    "for nearly centered dipole this means nearly equatorial magnetic field .",
    "more exotic possible configurations might be a grossly de - centered ( in latitude ) dipole , or quadrupole field with one positive and one negative pole visible ( for parts of the spin cycle ) and nearly at the same latitude .",
    "our improved ephemeris ( eq .",
    "2 ) allows us to phase some of the published x - ray curves with our ( @xmath0 ) circular polarization and light curves . in hard x - rays v405 aur shows a _ single _",
    "peak , and the epoch of the maximum given by de martino et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , hjd@xmath39 = 2 450 364.159695 , occurs at the phase 0.74 of our ephemeris .",
    "this is very near the phase ( 0.75 ) where the negative magnetic pole is pointing closest to us , and means that this pole is seen brighter in hard x - rays .",
    "evans & hellier ( 2004 ) define phase zero of their xmm - newton data as the peak of the larger of the soft x - ray maxima , which corresponds to hjd 2 452 187.55904 . with our ephemeris",
    "this takes place at the phase 0.44 , which is near the second maximum in the optical light curves ( phase 0.5 ) , where we look nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this would be in accordance with the standard accretion curtain model ( see e.g. hellier et al .",
    "1991 ) , where the opacity of the column causes x - rays to emerge preferentially perpendicular to the curtain , and argues against the other plausible explanation that foreshortening of the accretion polecaps when viewed face on and near the limb of the wd would be the dominating effect on the soft x - ray flux observed in v405 aur .",
    "however , neither de martino et al . ( 2004 ) nor evans & hellier ( 2004 ) found the absorption dip expected from the accretion - curtain dip model , and the soft x - ray behaviour of v405 aur vs. the magnetic phase requires further attention .",
    "if cyclotron harmonics are detected in the spectrum , they provide an accurate method for determining the magnetic field strength in the emission region .",
    "however , thermal broadening effects and magnetic field spread in an inhomogeneous region may smear out the harmonics and make them undetectable .",
    "also the overlying emission from other than the cyclotron source need to be carefully modeled and removed ( see e.g. cropper et al .",
    "because of these complications , cyclotron harmonic humps have not been seen in many of the known polars , and even if detected are visible only at some phase angle intervals during the wd spin cycle .    in v405",
    "aur the bright thermal emission from the disk and the accretion stream dilute the cyclotron flux at least by an order of magnitude when compared with strongly polarized polars which have @xmath40 20 - 40% .",
    "this makes the detection of cyclotron humps in the intensity spectrum of v405 aur unlikely .",
    "therefore , we have carried out circular spectropolarimetry with the aim to search for cyclotron harmonics in the _ polarized flux _",
    "spectra , where the effects from thermal emission sources are largely eliminated .",
    "most of the polarized spectra we obtained show no clear cyclotron harmonic pattern .",
    "however , at some phase angles of the wd spin period we see transient structures which suggest a possible cyclotron origin .",
    "a single 120 s exposure of the spectrum of the negative emission region in figure 9 shows three peaks ( downwards ) , the inverse wavelengths of which can be fitted with cyclotron harmonics @xmath5 = 6 , 7 , and 8 , at magnetic field of @xmath1 = 31.5@xmath30.8 mg . if confirmed , this would make v405 aur the first ip with a direct measurement of magnetic field , and the value found is typical of that of polars .      the broad - band ( @xmath0 ) circular polarization wavelength dependence ( fig .",
    "1 ) is similar to what is seen in moderately high - field polars ( @xmath4 25 - 50 mg ) , such as vv pup ( piirola et al .",
    "1990 ; schwope & beuermann 1997 ) and v834 cen ( piirola 1995 ; ferrario et al .",
    "1992 ) . our magnetic field estimates for v405 aur from the polarized flux spectrum ( @xmath4 25 mg , sect . 3.2 ) and",
    "spectropolarimetry ( @xmath4130 mg , sect .",
    "3.4 ) are in accordance with the values determined for those polars from cyclotron humps or zeeman spectroscopy .",
    "this makes v405 aur a likely candidate as a progenitor of a polar .    using a numerical model of magnetic accretion , norton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have predicted that ips with magnetic moments @xmath42 g @xmath43 and @xmath44 3 hr will evolve into polars . for a solar - mass wd a surface field of @xmath1",
    "= 30 mg corresponds to @xmath45 g @xmath43 , which gives further support that v405 aur may evolve into a polar .",
    "the ratio of the spin to the orbital period @xmath46 indicates that v405 aur is still far from synchronism . our spin period analysis ( fig . 3 and eqs .",
    "1 - 2 ) gives @xmath47 which is constant within tight limits , and the corresponding spin - down timescales are very long ( @xmath7 yr ) .",
    "therefore , v405 aur is currently accreting closely at the spin equilibrium rate . for small @xmath8 values",
    "this condition occurs in disk - like accretion ( norton et al . 2004 , 2008 ) .",
    "the angular momentum gain from accretion onto the wd balances the magnetic braking torque , and equilibrium is reached .    in figure 10",
    "we show the location of v405 aur in the @xmath47 vs. magnetic moment , @xmath48 , diagram from norton et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for @xmath49 = 4 hr , and three different mass ratios , q=0.2 , 0.5 , and 0.9 .",
    "the inferred magnetic field strength depends strongly on the value of @xmath50 . for the value of @xmath8",
    "= 0.0365 these numerical model computations predict a field @xmath1 = 20 mg for @xmath50 = 0.5 and the spin equilibrium condition , defined in these graphs by the boundary line between the d ( disk ) and p ( propeller ) , or the s ( stream ) and p ( propeller ) type accretion .",
    "lower @xmath50 implies larger @xmath1 ( 60 mg for @xmath50 = 0.2 ) . @xmath1=30",
    "mg would be obtained for @xmath51 0.4 from these models , assuming a solar mass wd in the conversion of @xmath48 to the surface field .",
    "because of the angular momentum loss via gravitational radiation and magnetic wind braking , v405 aur will evolve towards shorter orbital period and smaller binary separation , @xmath52 .",
    "it is expected that when small enough @xmath52 is reached , the magnetic braking torque will overcome the spin - up accretion torque and the wd will start to spin - down towards synchronization , the system thereby becoming a polar .",
    "our simultaneous multicolor ( @xmath0 ) circular polarimetry of the intermediate polar v405 aur has revealed polarization which peaks in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 passbands , similar to relatively high field ( @xmath53 mg ) polars . this is the first time that a polarized flux spectrum reaching maximum at such short wavelengths has been found in an ip , and suggests that v405 aur is the highest field ip found so far .",
    "we have also detected transient features in circularly polarized spectra which can be fitted on the wavenumber scale with cyclotron harmonics @xmath5=6 , 7 , and 8 , at a magnetic field of @xmath6 mg .",
    "such a field is consistent with the broad - band polarized flux spectrum observed , and this makes v405 aur a likely candidate of a progenitor of a polar .",
    "nearly sinusoidal and symmetric positive and negative circular polarization excursions in all of the @xmath0 passbands indicate that the two opposite magnetic poles are accreting at very similar rate , and are located far from the rotational poles , probably near the equator .",
    "for such a magnetic geometry , our numerical model simulations suggest wd spin axis inclination , @xmath30 = 30 - 50 . the broad - band circular polarization spectrum is flatter than predicted by constant temperature cyclotron models , and requires an inhomogeneous emission region with a spread of the physical parameters ( temperature , electron density , magnetic field ) and possibly a complicated geometry .",
    "period analysis from timings of the zero - crossover of circular polarization puts strict constraints on the wd spin period changes .",
    "the respective spin - down timescales are very long , @xmath7 yr , which means that the wd in v405aur is currently accreting very closely at the spin equilibrium rate . with the spin to orbital period ratio , @xmath46",
    ", such a condition is achieved in disk - type accretion where the angular momentum gain from matter transferred onto the wd via the disk balances the magnetic braking torque .",
    "comparison with numerical accretion model computations ( norton et al .",
    "2008 ) shows that for v405 aur equilibrium condition would be obtained with mass ratio @xmath10 0.4 , if the magnetic field is @xmath4 30 mg .",
