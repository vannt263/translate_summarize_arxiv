    "s : intro    `` maxwell s demon '' is a thought experiment proposed by j. c. maxwell  @xcite : if a thermodynamic system is subjected to feedback control at the level of thermal fluctuations , the second law can be apparently violated .",
    "a prominent example is the szilard engine  @xcite , which is a composite system of an engine and a memory .",
    "the memory measures the state of the engine and performs feedback to the engine .",
    "the feedback procedure allows positive work to be extracted from the engine through an isothermal cyclic process , which , under the usual circumstance , is prohibited by the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "szilard characterized the two separated steps of measurement and feedback as the processes which change the extent of the correlation between the engine and the memory , and suggested the possibility of an extended framework of thermodynamics for systems with the change in correlation .",
    "the consistency of the second law of thermodynamics with the existence of maxwell s demon has been discussed vigorously  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the key to understand the consistency is the change in the volume of the phase space  @xcite , which characterizes the thermodynamic irreversibility  @xcite .",
    "modern theories have revealed that this property is captured by the mutual information , which is a quantity that measures the correlation between the engine and the memory .",
    "the generalized thermodynamic relations with the mutual information has been discussed for a single feedback process  @xcite , continuous feedback processes  @xcite , feedback cooling  @xcite , and more general information processing  @xcite .    although these information - theoretic frameworks are expected to be useful in various problems in small fluctuating systems such as biochemical sensing  @xcite and quantum mesoscopic systems  @xcite , there is a critical remark to be made ; the original framework , which is applicable to the szilard - type demons with step - by - step separated measurement and feedback processes , can not be directly applied to autonomous stochastic information processes .",
    "this is because the processes of measurement and feedback can themselves occur stochastically at any time , and thus they are inseparable in autonomous setups . in purpose to extend the applicability of information thermodynamics to autonomous maxwell s demons , intensive researches on the model of autonomous demons  @xcite and information flow  @xcite have been recently made .",
    "autonomous demons can be modeled as bipartite markovian systems where the measurement and the feedback processes are not , in general , separated .",
    "the integral fluctuation theorem ( ift ) obtained for the autonomous demons has distinct features from the relation obtained for the szilard - type systems  @xcite .",
    "the crucial difference comes from the fact that in the szilard - type systems , the state of the engine ( memory ) is fixed externally during the measurement ( feedback ) phase , whereas in autonomous demons , it is not .    in this paper , we clarify the difference between szilard - type demons and autonomous demons on the basis of a general framework introduced in our previous paper  @xcite . in purpose to build a bridge between these two different setups , we propose a new model of maxwell s demon , which is autonomous but possesses separated measurement and feedback processes .",
    "the key ingredient in the model is an additional stochastic variable , which plays a role of separating the measurement phase and the feedback phase .",
    "an ift with the mutual information can be derived for this model , which is more similar to another ift satisfied in szilard - engine type demons  @xcite than to that for autonomous bipartite demons  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we first consider the autonomous 4-state model introduced in ref .",
