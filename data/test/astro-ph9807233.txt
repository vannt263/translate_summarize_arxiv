    "the carina dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy has an important place in the history of our understanding of stellar populations in external galaxies . at the time of its discovery ( cannon et al .",
    "1977 ) , there were six known dsph satellites of the milky way ( for an up - to - date census of these systems in the local group see da costa 1998 and mateo 1998a , b ) .",
    "all were believed to be essentially old stellar systems similar in stellar population to globular clusters .",
    "some evidence to the contrary did exist : baade ( 1963 ) and later zinn ( 1980 ) emphasized that the variable stars of dsph galaxies  in particular the rr  lyr stars and anomalous cepheids  suggested that their underlying stellar populations were fundamentally different from those of globular clusters .",
    "zinn postulated that the difference was age , such that the dsph systems were on average younger than globulars .",
    "subsequent deep photometric observations of the main sequence turnoffs ( msto ) in these galaxies confirmed this conjecture so spectacularly that it is now difficult to identify _ any _ dsph galaxy whose population is as uniformly old as that of a typical globular cluster ( see da costa 1998 for an excellent recent review ) !",
    "carina was the first dsph galaxy so observed in the early days of modern ccd detectors ( mould and aaronson 1983 ) and remains one of the more spectacular examples of a dsph galaxy with a significant intermediate - age population .",
    "mighell ( 1990 , 1997 ) , smecker - hane et al .",
    "( 1994a ) and hurley - keller et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter paper  i ) have obtained additional photometry of the carina main - sequence that confirms the bulk of its stars have ages ranging from about 4 - 7 gyr , though older ( saha et al . 1986 ) and younger stars are also clearly present .",
    "one consequence of the relative youth of carina is that its main sequence extends far above the canonical msto luminosity of globular clusters .",
    "many main - sequence stars are found in carina within the instability strip where short - period pulsating stars known as dwarf cepheids , sx  phe stars , @xmath7  sct stars , or ultra - short - period cepheids are found ( see mateo 1993 for a review of the properties and confused nomenclature of these stars ) . in this paper",
    "we shall refer to these variables as ` dwarf cepheids ' ( dc ) to emphasize that they are main - sequence stars pulsating in basically the same manner as classical cepheids .",
    "nemec et al . ( 1994 ; hereafter nnl ) provide a comprehensive survey of the then - known population ii dwarf cepheids , referring to these stars as ` sx  phe ' variables .",
    "many dcs also happen to be ` blue stragglers ' in their parent clusters , located above and to the blue of the msto .",
    "these blue - straggler sequences sometimes extend to the dwarf cepheid instability strip , a region normally forbidden to stars older than about 8 - 10 gyr ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "carina is a logical place to search for dcs as its main sequence extends up to and through the region where dwarf cepheids are found in other stellar systems as a result of its prominent intermediate - age population ( figure 1 ) .    in this paper",
    "we describe a search for dwarf cepheids in the carina dsph galaxy .",
    "the data used here are the same as those reported in paper  i , except that now we have analyzed the frames individually to perform time - series photometry , rather than combining the images to go as deep as possible .",
    "two challenges face us in this search .",
    "first , dcs have very short periods ranging from about 1 hour to 3 hours .",
    "any exposures longer than 10 - 15 minutes can ` smear out ' these rapid light variations .",
    "second , because dcs have modest luminosities ( @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) , they are expected to have @xmath10 magnitudes of @xmath022 - 24 in carina , rather faint for such short individual exposures . nonetheless , as we describe here",
    ", we have discovered 20 dcs in carina .",
    "the observations used here are the same as reported in paper  i. to review , the data were obtained using the ctio 4 m telescope with the prime - focus ccd camera during two runs in 1989 and 1990 . at the time , this camera contained a thinned , backside - illuminated ti @xmath11 ccd .",
    "the typical exposure time was 500  s in both the @xmath10 and @xmath12 filters .",
    "a log of the individual exposures is given in table 1 .",
    "three fields were observed , and a chart showing their relative locations is given in paper  i. field 1 was observed only in 1989 , and fields 2 and 3 were observed in 1990 .",
    "a known flat - fielding defect afflicts the first 100 columns of the ccd used in both runs ; no data from this section of the ccd were used in the analyses here or in paper  i. further details of the observations can be found in paper  i.    the individual processed frames were measured using the dophot photometry program ( schechter et al .",
    "1993 ) in the same manner as in paper  i. some of the frames with slightly poorer seeing than average that were excluded from the analysis of paper  i , but they are used here because we could reject individual poor measurements at later stages as required .",
    "details of the calibration of the resulting light curves are described below , but these are based on the transformations described in paper  i.      once the individual ccd images were reduced with dophot , we registered the coordinates to a common system .",
    "the typical rms of these transformations was 0.07 pixels , or about 0.04 arcsec .",
    "the data for a given field and filter were then combined into databases in which the individual photometric results were tabulated for each object found on every frame .",
    "approximately 800 - 1000 stars per field were found in each exposure compared to the 2000 - 3000 stars found in each of the deep images of each field in paper  i. there are fewer total epochs for fields 2 and 3 compared to field 1 , but all three fields were observed on at least two separate nights within their respective runs .    the photometric results for each image",
    "were then shifted to a common system defined by an arbitrarily - chosen template image .",
    "after some experimentation , we found that a simple additive shift to the instrumental @xmath10 and @xmath12 magnitudes was sufficient to bring all the images of a given filter and field to a common zero - point .",
    "we then determined the photometric transformation of the template images using the calibrated data from paper  i for each field .",
    "this transformation included the mean color terms found for the three fields , as well as a frame - specific offset used to convert to the standard system .",
    "for reasons we describe later , these transformations were not applied to the database photometry at this point .",
    "instead , we first identified candidate variables from the pre - calibrated but photometrically - shifted results .",
    "a first cut was made by calculating @xmath13 under the hypothesis that the stars are non - variable .",
    "although pulsating variables tend to have larger amplitudes in @xmath12 than in @xmath10 , we determined @xmath13 from the @xmath10-band data because we obtained many more epochs in that filter .",
    "stars with ` large ' values of @xmath13 were then extracted from the databases .",
    "we chose to be rather conservative at this stage , and selected a value of @xmath13 that allowed us to extract about 10%  of the total number of stars in the databases for each field .",
    "our motivation was to try to ensure complete coverage of all variables at the cost of having to sort through a significant number of non - variables in the process .",
    "at this point we also required that any candidate variable must have good photometric results from at least 90%  of the individual images .",
    "this was particularly important for fields 2 and 3 which have relatively few observations ; any fewer would have made it impossible to identify variables reliably .",
    "about 50 - 80 variable - star candidates were identified in each field with this procedure .",
    "we then took the photometry of the candidates and did a period search using the string algorithm described by dworetsky ( 1983 ) .",
    "the nine best periods were then used to fold the data and the resulting phased light curves were plotted together and inspected .",
    "the initial period search was rather broad , ranging from 0.05 to 2.0 days . in this manner",
    "we isolated 25 candidate dcs in the three carina fields .",
    "we then turned to each individual star and determined a ` best ' period using the same algorithm , but this time searching only in the range 0.05 - 0.10 days .",
    "because of our limited time coverage , the correct period is not always obvious ; we estimate an uncertainty of up to 10%  in the worst cases . for",
    "most of the stars , the periods we derived are the only ones consistent with the photometry and are probably accurate to the stated precision . when there was some ambiguity about the period , we selected the shortest period consistent with the data in the final period range noted above .",
    "this procedure probably biases our most uncertain periods to small values . because every field was observed on multiple nights , we deleted some promising candidates that did not repeat consistently even when their phased light curves looked quite convincing .",
    "the phased @xmath10-band light curves were used to determine the ephemerides for each candidate ; these are listed in table  2 in the form of the period ( in days ) and the approximate time of minimum light . because of the long interval between the time the data were taken and the present , these quantities are likely to be of little use to phase newer data . we have included these ephemerides in case some other data more contemporaneous to those reported here were obtained and are eventually analyzed .",
    "the @xmath12-band light curves were phased using these ephemerides .",
    "in a few remaining cases these were found to be inconsistent with the @xmath10-band data , either in the phasing or because the @xmath12-band data did not confirm variability .",
    "such stars were rejected as candidate variables .",
    "we then calibrated the light curves of the remaining candidates as follows .",
    "because the transformations to the standard system involve modest color terms , we could not simply transform the @xmath10 and @xmath12 photometry independently . also , because dcs vary in color during their pulsation cycle",
    ", we could not adopt a mean color . to deal with this we took one of the phased light curves ( say , @xmath10 ) for a given star , and for each point calculated the corresponding instrumental magnitude at the same phase from the phased light curve in the other filter ( in this case @xmath12 ) .",
    "this was done by linearly interpolating the second light curve about the the desired phase from the first light curve .",
    "this procedure was then repeated for the other light curve ( in this case @xmath12 ) .",
    "at the end of this process we identified 20 dwarf cepheids in our three fields ; 12 in field  1 , and four each in fields 2 and 3 .",
    "a summary of the properties of these 20 variables is provided in table 2 , and their light curves are shown in figure 2 .",
    "we have named the stars v1 - 20 .",
    "the individual photometry results for every epoch and every faint variable is listed in table 3 .",
    "note that the mean @xmath12 and @xmath10 magnitudes and mean @xmath14 colors for the variables are taken from paper  i. particularly for the @xmath12 band , we felt it was more reliable to derive the averaged photometry from the co - added images than from the light curves .",
    "only two stars , v11 and v12 , were not found in the photometry list from our deep images from paper  i. in these cases the mean photometry values in table 2 are obtained from intensity averaged means of the @xmath12 and @xmath10 light curves .",
    "note that the colors listed in table 2 are strictly defined as @xmath15 , and this is true of v11 and v12 also .",
    "the locations of the carina dcs is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the coordinates of the centers of the three fields are listed in the caption to figure 3 .",
    "further details can be found in paper  i.    given the quality of the light curves of the faintest variables ( v7 and v8 ) , we estimate that out procedure was capable of finding variables in this data set to @xmath16 , or about @xmath17 in carina .",
    "this limit is about 2 magnitudes brighter than the detection limit of our deep combined data , and may serve as a figure of merit for any future surveys that obtain sufficient exposures ( @xmath18 ) to identify such faint , short - period variables .",
    "we have not attempted to determine the completeness of our data as a function of magnitude , location , or photometric amplitude ; our results represent a lower limit to the number of dcs in carina .",
    "the locations of the variables in the color - magnitude diagram of carina is shown in figure 4 using the mean photometry from table 2 .",
    "two features are apparent from this diagram .",
    "first , the dcs do indeed cluster near the upper ms ; we shall discuss this further below .",
    "second , the approximate completeness limit for the detection of dcs in these data is well below the mean brightness of the variables we did identify .",
    "_ many _ stars above this limit and in the same general location as the dcs are definitely not variable with amplitudes larger than 0.02 - 0.04 mag in the @xmath10 band .",
    "we shall also return to the implications of this point below .",
    "we have plotted in figure 5 the period - apparent magnitude data for the dwarf cepheids in carina . plotted as solid lines are the fundamental and first - overtone dwarf cepheids from nnl ( they refer to them as sx  phe stars in this paper ) for an apparent @xmath10-band distance modulus of 20.17 and a mean metallicity of @xmath19 using their @xmath10-band period - luminosity - metallicity relations for these stars .",
    "this modulus is taken from smecker - hane et al .",
    "( 1994b ) who estimate a mean reddening of e@xmath3 = 0.025 .",
    "we have also adopted the metallicity proposed by these authors that they claim applies to the younger stars in carina .",
    "this value also agrees with the latest spectroscopic estimate of da  costa ( 1994 ) .",
    "we need to know the abundance for this analysis because nnl explicitly include a metallicity term in their period - luminosity relations for dcs .",
    "figure 5 shows that the carina dcs split into two groups that obey distinct period - luminosity ( pl ) relations .",
    "the brighter group consists of first - overtone pulsators , while the fainter group contains fundamental pulsators .",
    "the principal uncertainties in the data plotted in figure 5 are  uncharacteristically  in the horizontal axis , i.e. in the the periods .",
    "however , it is important to note that no stars can reasonably be switched from the overtone to fundamental group ( or _ vice versa _ ) due to period uncertainties , apart from v2 . from figure 5 it is also clear that the period range of the fundamental pulsators overlaps that of the overtone variables . unlike rr  lyr stars ,",
    "short - period dcs are _ not _ predominately overtone pulsators .",
    "inspection of figure 2 also reveals that the light curve shape is not uniquely correlated with the pulsation mode ( which is noted for each variable in the figure ) .",
    "thus , one can not simply assume that sinusoidal light curves correspond to overtone pulsators ( see v5 ) , nor that a ` sawtooth ' light curve identifies a fundamental - mode pulsator ( see v12 and v18 ) . because mass determinations for dwarf cepheids require knowledge of the pulsation mode ( e.g. see da costa et al .",
    "1986 ) , some caution is needed to assign the mode .",
    "figure 5 also reveals very good agreement between the carina dcs and the nnl period - luminosity relation when we adopt the smecker - hane et al .",
    "( 1994b ) distance , metallicity and reddening noted above . for these parameters",
    "the data agree well with the slope of the pl relation from nnl , particularly for the fundamental - mode pulsators which exhibit a wider period range than the overtone pulsators .",
    "the data are also consistent with the relative separation of the overtone and fundamental pl relations .",
    "all of these points suggest strongly that the carina dcs are ` normal ' for their class , despite their possibly different evolutionary origin ( mateo 1993 ) .",
    "mcnamara ( 1995 ) derived a pl relation for dcs and used preliminary results for the carina dcs ( nemec and mateo 1990 ) to derive a distance modulus of @xmath20 and [ fe / h ] = @xmath21 , for e(b@xmath4v ) = 0.025 . for [ fe / h ]",
    "= @xmath22 , the mcnamara ( 1995 ) pl relation gives a true modulus of @xmath23 .",
    "we can repeat this analysis using the most recent ( and reliable ) data on the carina dcs , and incorporating some other constraints on the metallicity and reddening of the galaxy .",
    "for example , if we fix the slope of the pl relations and set the metallicity dependence to the values suggested by nnl , we find a best estimate for the true distance modulus to be 20.07 @xmath5 0.03 for the metallicity and reddening adopted above .",
    "this result agrees well with the distance found by smecker - hane et al .",
    "( 1994b ) .",
    "more recently , mighell ( 1997 ) has proposed a true modulus of 19.87 @xmath5 0.11 for carina , with a visual extinction of 0.18 ( e@xmath3 = 0.051 ) , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath41.9 .",
    "a comparison of the resulting pl relations for these parameters is shown in figure 6 .",
    "there is a small systematic offset from the data for the carina variables ( 0.09 @xmath5 0.03 mag ) ; our best estimate of the true modulus is 19.96 @xmath5 0.03 for this reddening and metallicity .",
    "none of these results include realistic estimates of the uncertainties in the dc distance scale adopted by nnl which is tied directly to the distance of the metal - poor globular cluster m  15 .",
    "nnl adopted a true modulus of 15.03 ; for comparison , durrell and harris ( 1993 ) derive a true modulus of @xmath24 for the cluster .",
    "this change results in a carina modulus of 20.13 and 20.02 for the smecker - hane et al .",
    "( 1994b ) and mighell ( 1997 ) reddening / metallicity parameters , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties of the distance scale adopted by mcnamara ( 1995 ) are difficult to quantify because the calibrating stars are taken from a number of different sources and clusters ; it is likely that this scale is also uncertain at the 10 - 15%  level .",
    "we conclude that the best estimate of the distance to carina is approximately @xmath25 based on the dcs alone and assuming [ fe / h ] = @xmath22 and e(b@xmath4v ) = 0.025 .",
    "figure 7 shows a region enclosing the upper portion of the main sequence in carina and all 20 newly - discovered dwarf cepheids .",
    "we know from paper  i that the completeness in this region is quite high and uniform , and that the total field contamination is quite small .",
    "thus , we have simply counted the total number of stars in this region ( 844 ) to estimate the frequency of dcs in carina .",
    "we find that approximately one of 42 stars in this region of the color - magnitude diagram is a dwarf cepheid , or about 2.5%  of all upper main - sequence stars in carina .",
    "this is a lower limit because we have probably missed some small - amplitude variables .",
    "one consequence of this result has to do with the suitability of dcs as tracers of the sort of stellar population present in carina .",
    "there are numerous hints suggesting that the halo has considerable substructure , possibly from the accretion of small dwarfs ( rodgers et al .",
    "1981 ; majewski 1992 ; ct et al . 1993 ; arnold and gilmore 1992 ; preston et al .",
    "the discovery of the sgr dwarf galaxy ( ibata et al .",
    "1994 ) is a spectacular example that such accretion does occur even now to some extent .",
    "systematically identifying and tracing the substructure has proven to be quite difficult .",
    "can dcs help ?    in the case of carina ,",
    "the total area we surveyed for dcs is 0.013 deg@xmath26 , implying a mean surface density of dcs of 1540 @xmath5 340 deg@xmath27 ( poisson error ) .",
    "the mean @xmath10-band surface brightness of carina in these fields is about 25.5 mag arcsec@xmath27 .",
    "if instead we had viewed the same stellar population found in carina in a structure spread out to an average @xmath10-band surface brightness of 30.5 mag arcsec@xmath28 , we would have found approximately 15 dcs per square degree .",
    "such a faint surface brightness is unobservable in any conventional sense , but the detection of the associated dcs _ is _ possible",
    ". a deep , wide - field search for dcs might be useful to uncover extended structure beyond the tidal radius of carina , or perhaps other extended structures with similar populations elsewhere in the halo .",
    "closer halo structures would be more spread out , consequently requiring less depth but greater areal coverage to identify the dwarf cepheids .      in figure 7",
    "we plot the boundaries of the dc instability strip ( is ) from breger ( 1979 ) and from mateo ( 1993 ) superimposed on the cmd of carina .",
    "the locations of the carina dcs are consistent with the breger boundaries .",
    "most of the dcs lie within the more confined boundaries from mateo which was based on the locations of these variables in other intermediate - age and old stellar systems ( in the latter case , globular clusters with blue stragglers ) .",
    "the breger is boundaries are based on the locations of dcs associated with younger populations , and in particular the so - called @xmath7-sct stars which generally have very low amplitudes .",
    "these stars are generally drawn from field samples ; random errors in their reddenings and distances contribute to uncertainties in the location of the instability strip edges . because of the limited @xmath12-band phase coverage for the carina variables , the mean colors are sometimes in error by up to 0.1 - 0.2 magnitudes .",
    "this introduces some of the scatter visible in figure 7 .",
    "the close conformance of the carina dcs to the is boundaries is further evidence that these variables are normal for their class",
    ".    an obvious feature of figure 7  basically a corollary of the point raised in section 4.2 above  is that not all stars within the dwarf - cepheid instability strip are actually dwarf cepheids .",
    "we have looked at the light curves of a number of these nonvariables , and they are certainly constant to the precision of the data , or about 0.03 - 0.05 mag at the mean magnitude range of the detected dcs . among rr",
    "lyr stars and classical and type  ii cepheids , it is generally agreed that _ any _ star in the is will begin to pulsate and be seen as the appropriate sort of variable .",
    "this is clearly not true of large - amplitude dcs where we find that only 2 - 3%  of the stars in the is are variable with v - band amplitudes larger than 0.03 - 0.05 mag .",
    "saha et al .",
    "( 1986 ; hereafter ssm ) first searched for variable stars in carina using photographic plates with the ctio 4 m telescope .",
    "their search targeted rr  lyr stars and anomalous cepheids in carina and was not deep enough to detect the dcs described here .",
    "our data do include some measurements of the rr  lyr stars and candidates identified by ssm .",
    "a summary of the results of our observations of these stars is provided in table 4 .",
    "we confirm the two rr  lyr stars for which ssm derived periods and light curves : ssm  74 and ssm  116 . a third variable ",
    "ssm  65  was not included in our dataset due to its proximity to the central bright star in field  3 . of the 10 suspected variables from ssm that have adequate data in our observations we find that nine are certainly non - variable to @xmath29 mag .",
    "for the tenth star ",
    "ssm  87  our data can not confirm variability because the star is too close to the edge of field  2 .",
    "we also find one candidate rr  lyr variable that was not identified by ssm which we call ssm  176 to continue ssm s numbering sequence .",
    "the locations in the color - magnitude diagram of the two well - observed rr  lyr stars from ssm and our two additional candidate variables are shown in figure 4 .",
    "their locations in each carina field are noted in figure 3 along with the locations of the other apparently non - variables from ssm .",
    "our data are inadequate to determine periods much longer than 0.25 days without severe aliasing , so we can not comment on the periods for ssm  74 and 116 , and we are unable to determine a reliable period for ssm  176 .",
    "the location of ssm  176 in the cmd ( figure 4 ) is consistent with its identification as a possible rr  lyr star .",
    "we have identified an additional variable , ssm  177 , that appears to exhibit portions of two eclipses .",
    "we can not determine its period with any precision and its image appears to be composite in many of the individual ccd frames .",
    "we regard this star as only a weak candidate eclipsing contact binary that clearly requires confirmation .",
    "the photometric data for both ssm  176 and 177 are listed in table 4 and their locations are marked in figure 3 .    if the numbers of rr  lyr stars and dcs in our fields are typical of carina as a whole , we find the ratio of these variables to be @xmath30 , or 0.13 @xmath5 0.08 ( the fraction in the numerator represents ssm  176 which is the uncertain rr  lyr star found in our study ) .",
    "of course , the frequency of rr  lyr stars is highly variable and the numbers of dcs requires a significant intermediate - age population or blue stragglers .",
    "nonetheless , this result does suggest that dcs can greatly outnumber rr  lyr stars in populations of satellites in the outer galactic halo .",
    "we have discovered 20 dwarf cepheids in the carina dsph galaxy .",
    "these are by far the most distant ( @xmath0100 kpc ) and faintest ( @xmath31 ) dcs known .",
    "the carina dcs obey a well - defined period - luminosity relation , allowing us to distinguish between overtone and fundamental pulsators in nearly every case .",
    "unlike rr  lyr stars , the pulsation mode turns out to be uncorrelated with light - curve shape , nor do the overtone pulsators tend towards shorter periods compared to the fundamental pulsators . using the pl relations from nnl",
    ", we find good agreement with the distance / metallicity parameters advocated by smecker - hane et al .",
    "( 1994b ) : @xmath32 , e@xmath3 = 0.025 , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath22 and for the results of mighell ( 1997 ) using slightly different parameters .",
    "our best estimate of the carina true distance modulus is @xmath33 , where the uncertainty includes the errors of the dc distance scale ( nnl ; mcnamara 1995 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of @xmath34 kpc .",
    "the frequency of dcs among upper main sequence stars in carina is approximately 3%  in the region enclosed in figure 4 .",
    "we find that the ratio of dwarf cepheids to rr  lyr stars in carina is 0.13 @xmath5 0.10 , though of course the numbers of such stars are highly sensitive to the details of the star - formation history of carina and the evolution of the horizontal branch , respectively .",
    "the fact that we could discover these faint , short - period variables using a relatively poor ccd in mediocre seeing conditions ( by modern standards ) on a 4 m telescope suggests that these stars could conceivably be used as tracers of extended structure throughout the galactic halo .",
    "about one out of 40 upper main sequence stars in carina is a dc . if carina has a tidal tail or an extended halo ( see lynden - bell and lynden - bell 1995 for some motivation why this may occur ; kuhn et al .",
    "1996 ) , dcs may prove to be an excellent way to efficiently trace such extended structures .",
    "as noted in section 4.2 , if carina were spread out to 1%  of its current surface brightness we would expect to see about 15 of these stars per square degree .",
    "more generally , any survey of the galactic halo should identify one dcs per 40 so - called blue - metal - poor ( bmp ) star .",
    "these stars were first described by preston et al .",
    "( 1994 ; though their lineage extends back at least to rodgers et al . 1981 ) and may represent an intermediate - age population that comprises up to 10%  of the galactic halo . based on one detected dc , preston and landolt ( 1998 )",
    "find a frequency of about half this in their sample of spectroscopically studied bmp stars ; this result is not statistically different from the frequency we find in carina . in an on - going survey of the halo field , harding ,",
    "morrison , olszewski and mm find approximately 15 bmp stars per square degree to a limiting magnitude of @xmath35 .",
    "thus , one halo dc should occur in every three - square degree region covered by this survey , more frequently for deeper surveys . eventually , the numbers of bmp stars and dcs will fall off towards fainter magnitudes as the halo density drops and the frequency of all luminous halo stars becomes too low . precisely at",
    "what magnitude this occurs depends on the structural parameters of the halo . for a ` reasonable '",
    "halo one expects the number of bmp and therefore dcs to become negligible by @xmath36 in a halo devoid of substructure .",
    "other dsph stars may also contain dcs ; the prerequisite seems to be the existence of a significant intermediate - age population .",

    "1998 ) and fornax ( e.g. beauchamp et al . 1995 ; demers et al . 1998 ) contain large numbers of stars that appear to be considerably younger than globular clusters .",

    "it is therefore very likely that many of these systems contain dcs .",
