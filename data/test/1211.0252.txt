    "the study of the critical properties of lattice polymers , and thus of @xmath10 models when we let @xmath11 , in two dimensions has been ongoing over decades theoretically and numerically .",
    "nienhuis , in 1982 @xcite , considered a model of non - intersecting loops on the hexagonal lattice which allowed him to compute the critical exponents for free self - avoiding walks ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , which model dilute polymers , and for dense polymers ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) . in 1987 duplantier and saleur @xcite were able to model bond interactions introducing vacancies on the same lattice , obtaining a full set of critical exponents for the polymer collapse transition in the interacting self - avoiding walk ( isaw ) model .",
    "this collapse transition , a tri - critical point , goes under the name of ` @xmath8-point ' and has critical exponents @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "there was debate at the time over the surface exponents which was resolved by vanderzande et al .",
    "@xcite and stella et .",
    "al @xcite on the hexagonal lattice and on the square lattice by foster et al .",
    "@xcite .    in the quest for a solvable @xmath10 model on the square lattice , blte and nienhuis in 1989 @xcite",
    "considered a lattice model ( related to the izergin - korepin vertex model ) which includes weights for site - collisions and straight segments ( stiffness ) . for this model",
    "five critical branches are exactly known @xcite . in one of these branches ( named ` branch 0 ' in @xcite )",
    "straight segments are completely suppressed and it can be shown that in this case the model maps to the isaw model on the manhattan lattice for which the conjectured exponents are @xmath16 , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "two other branches correspond to dense and dilute polymers as obtained by nienhuis in @xcite , and the two remaining branches are , respectively , associated with a combination of ising - like and @xmath10 critical behaviour and with a new tri - critical point .",
    "this other tri - critical point , which we shall refer as a the bn - point , is another candidate for describing a collapsing polymer and has exponents @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the configurations associated with this particular @xmath10 model , which we shall call vertex - interacting self - avoiding walks ( visaws ) , are forbidden to cross and therefore are a subset of self - avoiding trails .",
    "the boltzmann weights corresponding to bn - point are known exactly and can be expressed as algebraic numbers .",
    "foster and pinettes @xcite have studied the semi - flexible visaw at this special bn - point , and have also studied the visaw model without stiffness , using the corner transfer matrix renomalisation group method . some agreement and some discrepancy with the scaling dimensions proposed @xcite",
    "was found in @xcite and a first order nature to the transition was conjectured . very recently",
    "foster and pinettes @xcite have used transfer matrices and the density matrix renormalisation group method ( dmrg ) to consider the bulk and surface exponents of these models . they have found values of the exponent @xmath7 much closer to @xmath9 than @xmath21 . in this paper",
    "we study by means of monte carlo simulation the semi - flexible visaw polymer model precisely at the bn - point .",
    "we find estimates for the exponents , and hence the scaling dimensions , that are in harmony with those found by foster and pinettes @xcite and at variance with those predicted by warnaar _",
    "et al .  _",
    "the semi - flexible visaw model can be defined as follows .",
    "self - avoiding trails , or simply trails , are lattice paths that can be formed such that they never visit the same bond more than once .",
    "such paths can generally visit the same site of the lattice either by a _",
    ", where the trail touches itself , or via a _ crossing _ , where two straight segments of the path cross over one another .",
    "consider the _ subset _ of bond - avoiding lattice paths ( trails ) on the square lattice , @xmath22 , where _",
    "no _ crossings are allowed .",
    "given such a restricted trail @xmath23 , we associate an energy @xmath24 every time the path visits the same site more than once , which it can only do by _ colliding _ with itself : see figure  [ fig : sfvisaw ] .",
    "additionally , we define a straight segment of the trail by two consecutive parallel edges , and we associate an energy @xmath25 to each straight segment of the trail , modelling the stiffness of the polymer chain .    ) collisions associated with a boltzmann weight @xmath26 and five ( @xmath27 ) straight segments , each associated with a boltzmann weight @xmath28 . ]    for each configuration @xmath23 we count the number @xmath29 of doubly - visited sites and @xmath30 of straight segments : see figure  [ fig : sfvisaw ] .",
    "hence we associate with each configuration a boltzmann weight @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the inverse temperature @xmath35 .",
    "the partition function of the model is given by @xmath36 the finite - length reduced free energy is @xmath37 and the thermodynamic limit is obtained by taking the limit of large @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 it is expected that there is a collapse phase transition at a temperature @xmath40 characterized by a non - analyticity in @xmath41 .",
    "equivalently , one can think of varying @xmath26 at fixed @xmath28 so that there is a collapse at some value of @xmath42 .",
    "the probability of a configuration @xmath43 is then @xmath44 and the average of any quantity @xmath45 over the ensemble set of path @xmath22 is given generically by @xmath46 in this paper we are interested in the following quantities .",
    "we calculate three measures of the size of the polymer , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , defined as follows .",
    "we specify any @xmath38-step path @xmath43 on a lattice by a sequence @xmath50 of vector positions of the vertices of that path .",
    "firstly , we are interested in the average - square end - to - end distance @xmath51 secondly , the ensemble average of the mean - square distance of a monomer from the endpoints @xmath52 and defining the average centre - of - mass as @xmath53 we , thirdly , are interested in the average radius - of - gyration @xmath54 in the above formulae we use @xmath55 .      the partition function at , and above",

    "it is well established @xcite that for @xmath61 ( equivalently @xmath62 ) we have @xmath63 .",
    "the collapse transition can also be characterized via a change in the scaling of the size of the polymer with temperature .",
    "the three measures of the size of the polymer defined above are expected to scale as @xmath64 where the amplitude @xmath65 is non - universal and temperature dependent , while @xmath7 is expected to be universal , depending only on the temperature in as much as its value is above , at , or below , the collapse point . in two dimensions",
    "it is also estabslished @xcite that @xmath66 for @xmath61 .",
    "duplantier and saleur @xcite identified a tri - critical point , known as the @xmath8-point , which is expected to describe the collapse of a polymer in two dimensions .",
    "this point has thermal and magnetic scaling dimensions @xmath67 , @xmath68 and consequently polymer exponents @xmath16 and @xmath17 . on the other hand , warnaar _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite predicted @xmath69 and @xmath70 for the semi - flexible visaw model at its collapse point .",
    "one can also usefully define the finite - length amplitude ratios @xmath71 since these approach universal values @xcite @xmath72 in the limit @xmath73 . for collapsing polymers",
    ", the limiting values should depend only on dimension and whether the temperature is above or at the collapse transition point .    for free self - avoiding walks ( which should include the visaw model at high temperatures ) it",
    "was predicted @xcite that @xmath74 in the derivation @xcite of this invariant the factor multiplying @xmath75 was given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the thermal and magnetic renormalisation group eigenvalues , respectively , of the dilute o(0 ) model .",
    "these eigenvalues are related to the conformal scaling dimensions via @xmath79 .",
    "hence @xmath80 the identity ( [ eqn : identity ] ) implies that one can estimate this function of the scaling dimensions as @xmath81 from estimates of @xmath75 and @xmath82 .",
    "this was done for various collapse models in @xcite .",
    "hence , if we have a conjectured value of one of the scaling dimensions we can estimate the other from an estimate of @xmath83 .",
    "the special multi - critical point of the @xmath10 model that maps to the semi- flexible visaw and allows for the calculation of the scaling dimensions via the bethe ansatz is given by special values of the parameters in the grand canonical partition function    @xmath84    the location of this point is reported exactly in @xcite @xmath85      [ 1 + 2\\sin(\\theta/2)]^2 \\right\\}^{-1 } \\\\",

    "we can give the conjectured value of the connective constant @xmath57 in the canonical model ( [ eq : canonical ] ) at fixed boltzmann weights @xmath90 as @xmath91 the set of scaling dimensions evaluated in @xcite at this ( multi-)critical point are @xmath92 the thermal @xmath93 and magnetic @xmath94 scaling dimensions were identified @xcite as @xmath95 it can be seen that these scaling dimensions are not those of unweighted self - avoiding walks ; this is compatible with the hypothesis that they are those of a collapse multi - critical point .",
    "the exponents @xmath7 and @xmath60 were then calculated @xcite in the standard way as @xmath96",
    "we simulated the model ( [ eq : canonical ] ) at the fixed values of @xmath97 and @xmath98 using the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method ( perm ) @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the traditional rosenbluth and rosenbluth sampling method where biased samples of polymer configurations are generated along with a weight factor such that the weighted average over all polymer configurations will converge towards the correct boltzmann average .",
    "perm improves the efficiency of this algorithm by making multiple copies of partially grown chains that have a large statistical weight ( enriching ) and discarding configurations with small statistical weight ( pruning ) .",
    "we ran three simulations with maximal length @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath4 , growing @xmath101 independent walks each and collecting from @xmath102 to @xmath103 samples at each maximal length .",
    "the number of samples adjusted by the number of their independent growth steps is between @xmath104 and @xmath105 `` effective samples '' .     of the polymer size , the mean - square end - to - end distance @xmath106 ( top ) , the square of the radius of gyration @xmath107 ( bottom ) , and the mean - square distance of a monomer to its end points @xmath108 ( middle ) versus the length @xmath38 of the path",
    ". the data from different simulations up to lengths @xmath109 ( blue circles ) , @xmath100 ( green triangles ) , and @xmath4 ( red line ) clearly overlap .",
    "the exponent estimates for @xmath7 shown are derived from fitting straight lines through lengths @xmath109 to @xmath100 and @xmath100 to @xmath4 , respectively . ]    in figure  [ fig : r ] we plot on a double - logarithmic scale the three different measures @xmath110 of the polymer size . from various fits",
    "we consistently find estimates of @xmath7 near @xmath9 rather than @xmath21 .",
    "our best estimate is    @xmath111    this leads to an estimate of the thermal scaling dimension as @xmath112     versus the length @xmath38 of the path .",
    "the difference between data from different simulations up to lengths @xmath109 , @xmath100 , and @xmath4 indicate the accuracy achieved .",
    "the exponent estimate for @xmath60 shown is derived from fitting straight lines through lengths @xmath113 to @xmath109 to data from the best - converged simulation . ]    to obtain an estimate of @xmath60 we looked at the scaling of the canonical partition function .",
    "we first measured @xmath57 by a simple linear fit obtaining @xmath114 , and observing that our value matches the value obtained from the bn - model , we then assumed @xmath115 .",
    "we hence plotted , in figure  [ fig : z ] , on a double - logarithmic scale the normalized partition function @xmath116 versus the length @xmath38 of the path .",
    "this allows us to estimate @xmath60 from straight line fits which we give as @xmath117 interestingly , this value is different from both the @xmath8-point value of @xmath118 and the bn - point @xmath119 .",
    "using @xmath120 and our estimates of @xmath60 and @xmath7 in equations  ( [ eqn : gamma - estimate ] ) and ( [ eqn : nu - estimate ] ) gives us the estimate @xmath121 we point out that this estimate is positive while the conjectured value above in equation  ( [ eqn : bn - scaling - dims ] ) is not .",
    "versus @xmath122 , together with a straight - line fit .",
    "the difference between data from different simulations up to lengths @xmath109 , @xmath100 , and @xmath4 indicate the accuracy achieved .",
    "the extrapolated value for @xmath83 shown is derived from fitting straight lines through lengths @xmath113 to @xmath109 to data from the best - converged simulation . ]    to obtain an independent estimate of @xmath94 we attempted to estimate the universal quantity @xmath83 described above . in figure",
    "[ fig : lambda ] we plot the finite - size amplitude ratio combination @xmath123 versus @xmath122 , which is the natural scale given the results above for the size measures .",
    "we find an estimate of this universal value as @xmath124 unfortunately , the error estimate here is relatively larger than that estimated from the partition function analysis and we estimated @xmath125 , which encompasses our more precise estimate in ( [ eqn : xh - estimate ] ) .",
    "for the sake of completeness we have also found estimates of the universal amplitude ratios @xmath126 and @xmath127 by fitting against a correction of @xmath122 , which provide consistent straight fit extrapolations @xmath128 these values of @xmath126 and @xmath127 are different from the values for any of the three collapse models considered in @xcite .",
    "we have simulated the special point , known as the bn ( blte - nienhuis ) point , of the semi - flexible visaw model of polymer collapse , which is associated with an integrable branch of the @xmath10 loop model @xcite .",
    "the exponent estimates we find , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , are not in accord with those previously found from the @xmath10 loop model .",
    "our estimate of @xmath7 is compatible with the value accepted for the @xmath8-point , which is @xmath131 , and in good agreement with the results of foster and pinettes @xcite who have used transfer matrices and dmrg .",
    "however , our estimate of @xmath60 is not comparable to any known value .",
    "we have found estimates of @xmath60 via two different methods : one method we used involved the direct estimation of the exponent from the partition function , and the other used results from conformal field theory and universal amplitude ratios of different size measures of the polymer ; our estimates from these two methods broadly agree .",
    "our results seem to suggest that the bn point is @xmath8 like , at least with respect to its size scaling exponent with @xmath16 .",
    "this may seem at odds with our recent claim @xcite that the visaws , which do nt weight straight segments and have @xmath132 in the notation of this paper , have a collapse transition in the same universality class as the interacting self - avoiding trails @xcite .",
    "this was based , however , upon analysis of the specific heat .",
    "of course , the two claims are not in direct contradiction but they lie uncomfortably together . in particular , it leaves open the question whether the conclusion that the isat universality class extends down to , and importantly includes , the visaw line , where the weight for crossings segments ( @xmath133 in @xcite ) vanishes . on the other hand , if both claims are true , there must be a change of universality class on varying @xmath28 .",
    "it should be emphasised however that an estimate of the exponent @xmath7 for collapsing visaws is not available at the moment , since the lack of knowledge of the exact location of the transition for @xmath134 makes obtaining good estimates a significantly harder task .",
    "clearly , something subtle is occurring in this system if our numerical analysis is accurate .",
    "of course , large corrections to scaling may be at work here . in any case",
    ", further theoretical work is needed to tease out this issue .    financial support from the australian research council via its support for the centre of excellence for mathematics and statistics of complex systems and through its discovery program is gratefully acknowledged by the authors .",
