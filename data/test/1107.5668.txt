    "type ii supernovae ( sne ) are the end stage of the evolution of massive stars with initial masses on the zero age main sequence greater than 8 @xmath0 .",
    "these explosive events deposit a tremendous energy to the surroundings with typical explosion energy of 10@xmath1 ergs per event .",
    "the explosion releases a burst of neutrons and synthesised elements heavier than iron through rapid neutron capture ( i.e , r - process ) .",
    "the explosion shock wave crosses the helium core , induces a reverse shock at the interface between the heavy elements core and the hydrogen envelope of the stellar progenitor , and reprocesses the ejecta a few hours after explosion .",
    "this reverse shock triggers the onset of raleigh - taylor instabilities and results in macroscopic mixing between the various core layers . the nebular phase of the sn is reached after @xmath2 100 days when the luminosity is sustained essentially by the radioactive decay of @xmath3co .",
    "assuming @xmath4-rays  full trapping , the bolometric light curve declines according to the mean lifetime of @xmath3co  decay into @xmath3fe  ( @xmath5 days ) . in view of this very harsh environment , the detection of molecules in the nebular phase a few months following the explosion of a sn came as a surprise .",
    "the locus of the first detection of molecules and dust in a sn event shortly after outburst was the type ii supernova sn1987a in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "indeed , the fundamental band @xmath6 of carbon monoxide , co , at 4.65 @xmath7 m was observed between day 135 and day 260 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* catchpole et al . 1988 ) ) , while the co first overtone transition @xmath8 in the region of 2.3 @xmath7 m was detected at day 100 after explosion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( danziger et al . 1988 ) ) .",
    "excess emission around @xmath2 9 @xmath7 m was attributed to the fundamental band @xmath6 of silicon monoxide , sio , and was observed as early as day 160 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aitken et al . 1988 ) ) .",
    "other molecular candidates were proposed as carriers of some unidentified bands in the ir spectrum and included cs ( 3.88 @xmath7 m band ) , h3@xmath9 ( 3.4 @xmath7 m and 3.53 @xmath7 m bands ) and co@xmath9 ( 2.26 @xmath7 m band ) .",
    "however , claims for their presence were not confirmed by theoretical models .",
    "since then , carbon and silicon monoxide ro - vibrational emission bands have been observed in other type ii sne as well and appear to be the only molecules detected in sn ejecta to date .",
    "this restricted number of observed species may point to the specific environment of sn ejecta characterised by harsh conditions , the presence of helium ions , and the lack of microscopically - mixed hydrogen .",
    "this hydrogen - deprived medium fosters a poor chemistry . indeed",
    ", because of the absence of radicals like hydrides ( oh , ch etc . ) , a fast , hot chemistry that builds up larger , more complex species ( e.g. , hydrocarbons , water or carbon dioxide ) can not proceed , as it is the case in other circumstellar environments [ e.g. , agb stellar winds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( cherchneff 2006 ) ) ] .",
    "the chemical species thus formed are essentially simple diatomic molecules like co and sio .",
    "the detection in the near ir of the first overtone band of co has been positive in several type ii sne at epochs ranging from 90 to 130 days after explosion . along with the first overtone",
    ", the red wing of the fundamental band @xmath6 at 4.65 @xmath7 m is also detected in the mid - ir ( e.g. , kotak et al .",
    "models of the co bands indicate conditions in the ejecta close to those provided by explosion models @xmath2 130 days post - outburst .",
    "i.e. , gas temperature close to 5000 k. the co molecule is always present in sn ejecta some 100 days after outburst , pointing to an efficient chemical pathway to its synthesis at high temperatures . in sn1987a , the co first overtone band flux peaks around 180 days before declining by several orders of magnitude up to day 600 where it became unobservable ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( danziger et al . 1989 ) ) .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed in other sne , for example , sn2005af ( kotak et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this decrease can be ascribed either to a change in co mass with time or to different excitation conditions owing to the change in gas temperature , or both . in sn1987a , the fundamental band of co",
    "is also observed to decrease in absolute strength with time but at a much smaller rate than the first overtone band ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( danziger et al . 1989 ) ) .",
    "the different behaviour of these two bands may indicate that they arise from different zones in the ejecta .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     we study the chemistry of the ejecta associated with a 15 @xmath0  progenitor of solar metallicity",
    ". a schematic view of conditions in the ejecta is given in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "a pre - supernova core explodes and experiences the passage of a blast wave which triggers a reverse shock at the base of the hydrogen envelope .",
    "this shock propagates inward and leaves a reversed pressure - gradient in its wake that produces rayleigh - taylor instabilities and macroscopic mixing in the helium core .",
    "the mixing has ceased after a few days ( @xcite ) and the partial fragmentation of the helium core proceeds with time .",
    "radioactive @xmath3ni  decays into @xmath3co  on short time scales , and the later decay of @xmath3co  in  @xmath3fe  creates @xmath4-rays  that propagate in the ejecta .",
    "these @xmath4-rays  degrade to x - rays and ultraviolet ( uv ) photons by compton scattering and create a population of fast compton electrons in the ejecta .",
    "these compton electrons ionise the elements , including helium .",
    "typical temperatures and densities are also indicated as a function of time in the ejecta .",
    "following @xcite , the ejecta is assumed homogeneous and consists of several mass zones characterised by an initial chemical composition taken from @xcite for their study of a 15 @xmath0  progenitor of solar metallicity .",
    "the elements in each zone are assumed to be microscopically mixed but no elemental mixing between zones is considered .",
    "we assume that the helium core is hydrogen - free as no microscopic mixing of hydrogen takes place inward in the core .",
    "hydrogen thus stays confined to the most external layer that corresponds to the progenitor envelope .",
    "the zoning considered in this study is briefly summarised in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "we model the formation of several key molecules , including co , sio , o@xmath10 , so and sis , as well as small molecular clusters of various solids ( e.g. , sio@xmath10 , fes , pure metals , carbon chains and rings ) as in @xcite .",
    "we study the chemical processes active after outburst from 100 days to 1000 days , a time span relevant for the study of molecule and dust synthesis in the ejecta .",
    "they include the formation of molecules by termolcular reactions and by bimolecular processes like neutral - neutral reactions , radiative association reactions and ion - molecule reactions .",
    "the destruction processes include ionisation and dissociation processes by compton electrons and the uv radiation field , ion - molecule reactions , neutral - neutral processes and thermal fragmentation .",
    "the mass of sio formed in the ejecta as a function of time is illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "for comparison , we have included the sio masses derived from observations of various type ii sne .",
    "zones 1b , 2 and 3 are the prevalent providers of sio through formation processes including neutral - neutral and radiative association reactions .",
    "the sio mass variation with time agrees well with the decline of the observed sio mass , in particular that of sn2004et ( kotak et al .",
    "however , this agreement implies that the effective and steady conversion of gas - phase sio into small molecular clusters of sio@xmath10 and si proceeds at early time ( @xmath2 150 days post - outburst ) for the three zones where sio efficiently forms . in this regard ,",
    "the sio molecule is a direct tracer of the formation of silicate dust in sn ejecta .",
    "observations of sio at several post - explosion times thus probe the effectiveness of dust synthesis in these environments .",
    "results for co as a function of mass zones and time are shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "co masses derived for sn1987a from models by @xcite and @xcite are also plotted for comparison .",
    "however , a 15 @xmath0  progenitor model may not be appropriate for sn1987a , for which a more massive progenitor has been proposed ( @xcite ) .",
    "the metallicity of sn1987a progenitor is also sub - solar and similar to that of the lmc . the trends of the co masses derived for sn1987a , i.e. , an effective formation of co in large amounts at very early times",
    ", are reproduced by our results although we produce more co in the 15 @xmath0  ejecta .",
    "co is prevalently formed in the two outer zones 4a and 4b where oxygen is still overabundant with respect to carbon and where helium is absent ( zone 4a ) or exists in small amounts ( zone 4b ) . from our results ,",
    "there exits no direct link between the presence of co in the ejecta and carbon dust .",
    "the latter is traced by the formation of carbon chains and rings in our model , and forms in the outer , he / c - rich zone 5 , when the he@xmath9  abundance has diminished , either due to its effective recombination with thermal electrons or to non - effective ionisation of helium by compton electrons .",
    "small amounts of co are formed in zone 5 but most of the carbon is either in atomic form or in carbon dust precursors .",
    "therefore , co formation is not linked to the condensation of carbon solids and co is not a tracer of carbon dust in sn ejecta .",
    "co is just the prevalent molecule that forms in zones rich in oxygen and carbon , and poor in helium , whatever the initial c / o ratio of the zones .",
    "other molecular species are produced in large amounts in the ejecta and trace the specific chemical composition of their formation zones . in the inner most mass zone 1a , silicon sulphide , sis , forms efficiently from radiative association and neutral - neutral reactions , pumping about 34 % of the atomic si present in the zone .",
    "the sis mass at day 1000 is @xmath11 @xmath0 . because zones 2 and 3 are very rich in free atomic oxygen , the formation of dioxygen , o@xmath10 proceeds as early as 300 days . in zone 1b and 2 , sulphur is still abundant and its reaction with o@xmath10 induces the formation of sulphur monoxide , so , as soon as o@xmath10 forms .",
    "the final masses of o@xmath10 and so at 1000 days post - explosion are @xmath12 @xmath0  and @xmath13 @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the ejecta of sne form two types of molecular species , those directly involved in the formation processes of dust ( e.g. , sio ) and those only depleting gas - phase elements ( e.g. , co , o@xmath10 )",
    ". members of the first category are rapidly depleted in the synthesis of dust and are thus direct tracers of the dust formation processes .",
    "therefore , dedicated observational surveys of these specific species at various times after outburst would be extremely useful to directly assess the efficiency with which the sn ejecta produces dust .",
    "molecules of the second kind are of great interest as well . for the present 15 @xmath0  progenitor model with solar metallicity ,",
    "they represent @xmath2 17% of the ejected mass at day 1000 and include co , o@xmath10 , sis and so .",
    "somewhat larger mass fractions of ejected molecules were derived for zero - metallicity sne in the early universe ( cherchneff & dwek 2009 ) .",
    "these large molecular fractions impact the gas in two major ways .",
    "firstly , the depletion by molecules of elements entering the processes of dust synthesis takes place and needs to be considered when assessing the amount of dust formed in sne .",
    "this is well exemplified by the formation of gas - phase s@xmath10 and sis in zone 1a , which depletes atomic sulphur , thus impacting on the formation of fes clusters .",
    "secondly , molecules like co are strong coolants through their ro - vibrational transitions and their presence will affect the thermal history of the environment where they reside .",
    "the cooling provided by co molecules in o / c - rich clumps applied to the ejecta of sn1987a was addressed by @xcite .",
    "they considered clumps with equal masses of atomic o and c and where 1% of the mass was in co. the cooling provided by co could decrease the gas kinetic temperature down by a factor of three compared to co - free gas where cooling was essentially provided by the 6300  and 6363  forbidden lines of [ oi ] . in the present model , the co mass corresponds to @xmath2 2% of the o - rich core mass ( i.e. , zones 2 and 3 ) at day 400 , where the mass fraction reaches @xmath14% of the co formation zone ( i.e. , zones 4a and 4b ) at a similar time .",
    "the cooling provided by co molecules must thus be strong as derived by @xcite .",
    "such a cooling will favour more efficient molecule and dust synthesis in the ejecta dense clumps .",
    "species of the second category are also crucial to the study of the sn ejecta evolution at very late time , i.e. , in young sn remnants like cas a. molecules like co or sis are expected to survive in the dense , cool clumps where they formed and young remnants that have not yet been shocked by the reverse shock are expected to bear such a molecular signature .",
    "these species should thus be detectable at sub - millimetre wavelengths in young sn remnants and would not only provide clues on the local kinetics and the chemistry active in clumps or filaments but also on their chemical synthesis in the prior sn stage .",
