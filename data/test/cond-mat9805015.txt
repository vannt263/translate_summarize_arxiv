    "recent developments in the physics of ultra - cold gases have led to the discovery of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in trapped clouds of alkali atoms @xcite and stimulated a tremendous boost in theoretical studies of weakly interacting bose gases . as in previous years , these studies rely on the binary approximation for the interparticle interaction .",
    "the latter is characterized by the 2-body scattering length @xmath0 , which assumes the presence of a small gaseous parameter @xmath1 ( n is the gas density ) . especially intensive",
    "are the attempts to reach beyond the ordinary mean field approach and to develop a theory which can properly describe the behavior of finite temperature elementary excitations of a trapped bose - condensed gas and in particular , explain the jila @xcite and mit @xcite experiments on energy shifts and damping rates of the excitations .    the commonly used mean field theory ( for @xmath2 )",
    "is based on the bogolyubov quasiparticle approach developed originally for a spatially homogeneous bose - condensed gas at @xmath3 @xcite and employed by lee and yang @xcite ( see also @xcite ) at finite temperatures .",
    "the generalization of the bogolyubov method for spatially inhomogeneous systems has been described by de gennes @xcite . in the case of a bose - condensed gas",
    "it should be completed by the equation for the wavefunction of the spatially inhomogeneous condensate , derived by pitaevskii @xcite and gross @xcite .    for spatially homogeneous gases the theory beyond the mean field approach was also developed .",
    "beliaev @xcite constructed the zero - temperature diagram technique which allows one to find corrections to the energies of bogolyubov excitations , proportional to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the condensate density .",
    "the corrections are provided by the interaction between the excitations ( in particular , through the condensate ) and contain both real ( energy shift ) and imaginary ( damping rate ) parts . at @xmath6",
    "the latter originates from spontaneous decay of a given excitation ( @xmath7 ) to two other excitations ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , with smaller energies and momenta : @xmath10 .",
    "a universal expression for the chemical potential in terms of the self - energy functions has been found by pines and hugenholtz @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the corrections proportional to @xmath11 already depend on the contribution of 3-body interactions and , hence , can not be obtained within the binary approximation .",
    "the beliaev approach was employed by popov @xcite at finite temperatures . in this case",
    "the corrections to the beliaev self - energies contain infra - red singularities , i.e. they tend to infinity for momenta @xmath12 .",
    "this prompted popov to make a renormalization of the theory , which links the microscopic approach with phenomenological landau hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the popov theory eliminates the infra - red singularities and allows one to describe the behavior of low - energy excitations ( phonons ) at temperatures much smaller than the mean field interparticle interaction @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the atom mass ) .",
    "the damping of phonons in this temperature range is determined by the beliaev damping processes and has also been calculated by hohenberg and martin @xcite .",
    "a simplified approach within the dielectric formalism was used by szepfalusy and kondor @xcite for calculating the damping rates of excitations in the phonon branch of the spectrum .",
    "they found that at temperatures @xmath16 the damping rate of a given excitation ( @xmath7 ) originates from the scattering of thermal excitations ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) on the excitation @xmath7 through the processes @xmath17 .",
    "since the characteristic energies of the thermal excitations @xmath8 , @xmath9 turn out to be much larger than the energy of the excitation @xmath7 , this damping channel can be treated as landau damping .",
    "it should be noted that the damping rates can be simply found by considering the interaction between the excitations as a small perturbation and using fermi s golden rule .",
    "this allows one to properly take into account the bogolyubov nature of the thermal excitations .",
    "the damping rates of phonons in a spatially homogeneous bose - condensed gas , in particular for the szepfalusy - kondor mechanism , have been calculated in the recent contributions @xcite .    in order to reach beyond the mean field theory at @xmath18 one",
    "should further develop the popov approach .",
    "one can also proceed along the lines of the beliaev theory , since any physical quantity should be determined by combinations of the beliaev self - energies , which do not contain the infrared singularities . in this paper",
    "we choose the latter way and construct the perturbation theory for a bose - condensed gas , which allows us to find the next to leading order terms ( the terms proportional to @xmath4 ) in the energy spectrum of the elementary excitations . as in @xcite , we consider the excitations in the so - called collisionless regime , where their de broglie wavelength is much smaller than the mean free path of the thermal excitations .",
    "we start with the case of a spatially homogeneous bose - condensed gas and find temperature - dependent energy shifts and damping rates for bogolyubov excitations of any energy . at temperatures @xmath16 the small parameter of the theory proves to be @xmath19 in contrast to @xmath20 for @xmath6 .",
    "the appearance of the extra factor ( @xmath21 ) originates from the bose occupation numbers of thermal excitations with energies of order @xmath13 , which are the most important in the perturbation theory .",
    "as shown below , the damping of excitations with energies @xmath22 is determined by both the szepfalusy - kondor ( @xmath23 ) and beliaev ( @xmath24 ) processes , and can no longer be treated as landau damping .    the theory is generalized for the case of excitations in a spatially inhomogeneous ( trapped ) bose - condensed gas .",
    "a new ingredient here is related to the inhomogeneous density profile of the condensate and the discrete structure of the excitation spectrum .",
    "we develop the method of calculating the self - energy functions and derive the equations for finding the wavefunctions and energies of the excitations ( generalized bogolyubov - de gennes equations ) .",
    "the use of the theory is demonstrated by two examples .",
    "the first one concerns quasiclassical low - energy excitations of a trapped bose - condensed gas in the thomas - fermi regime . the term `` low - energy '' assumes that the excitation energy @xmath25 is much smaller than the mean field interparticle interaction @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the maximum condensate density ) , and the quasiclassical character of the excitations requires the condition @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the characteristic trap frequency .",
    "we consider anisotropic harmonic traps , where the discrete structure of the excitation spectrum is not important ( see below and in @xcite ) . on the contrary",
    ", the inhomogeneity of the condensate density profile has a crucial consequence for the damping rates and energy shifts of quasiclassical low - energy excitations .",
    "the most important turns out to be the boundary region of the condensate , where @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the result for the damping rates and energy shifts is completely different from that in spatially homogeneous gases .",
    "finally , we analyze the frequency shifts and damping of axially propagating sound waves in cylindrical bose condensates .",
    "as found , the nature of damping is similar to that in the case of phonons in spatially homogeneous bose condensates .",
    "we show that the attenuation of axially propagating sound wave packets in the recent mit experiment @xcite can be well explained as a consequence of this damping .",
    "we consider a weakly interacting bose - condensed gas confined in an external potential @xmath31 .",
    "the grand canonical hamiltonian of the gas can be written as @xmath32 , where ( hereinafter @xmath33 ) @xmath34 and the term @xmath35 assumes a point interaction between atoms .",
    "the field operator of atoms @xmath36 can be represented as the sum of the above - condensate part @xmath37 and the condensate wavefunction @xmath38 which is a _ c_-number . as the interparticle interaction @xmath39 contains both terms conserving the number of above - condensate particles and terms transferring two above - condensate particles to the condensate ( or two condensate particles to the above - condensate part ) , the diagram technique should include both the normal green function @xmath40 and the anomalous green function @xmath41 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the sums of the contributions of all irreducible diagrams will be represented by the normal ( @xmath42 ) and anomalous ( @xmath43 ) self - energies ( see fig.1 and fig.2 ) .",
    "the former corresponds to the processes conserving the number of above - condensate particles , and the latter describes absorption ( or emission ) of two particles to ( out of ) the condensate .",
    "the green function and self - energy operators satisfy beliaev - dyson equations @xcite @xmath44 where the green functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 describe forward and backward propagation of a particle characterized by the hamiltonian @xmath47 .",
    "we confine ourselves to the case of repulsive interaction between the atoms ( @xmath48 ) . to develop the finite temperature perturbation theory for calculating dynamic properties and finding the excitation spectrum of a weakly interacting bose - condensed gas we will use the non - equilibrium generalization @xcite of the matsubara diagram technique . in eqs .",

    "we will consider low - energy excitations ( @xmath77 ) , i.e. , the excitations with the axial wavelength much larger than the correlation length @xmath233 .",
    "in the recent mit experiment @xcite localized excitations of this type were created in the center of the trap by modifying the trapping potential using the dipole force of a focused off - resonant laser beam .",

    "the sound waves propagating in an infinitely long ( axially homogeneous ) cylindrical bose condensate have been discussed in @xcite .    for revealing the key features of the non - mean - field effects ( damping and the change of the sound velocity ) we confine ourselves to the same trapping geometry .",
    "with regard to realistic cylindrical traps this will be a good approach if the mean free path of sound waves is smaller than the characteristic axial size of the sample . as found in @xcite , for axially propagating sound waves radial oscillations of the condensate",
    "are absent , and the wavefunctions @xmath293 , with @xmath294 and @xmath295 being the axial momentum .",
    "the dispersion law @xmath296 is characterized by the sound velocity equal to @xmath297 , where @xmath298 is the maximum density of the thomas - fermi condensate in the ordinary mean field approach .",
    "it should be noted from the very beginning that , according to eq.([cd1 ] ) , @xmath299 is related to the corrected value of the maximum condensate density @xmath27 as @xmath300 .",
    "therefore , being interested in the sound velocity at a given value of the maximum condensate density , one should substitute this expression to eq.([disp ] ) .",
    "this immediately changes the sound velocity to @xmath301 in the leading term ( [ disp ] ) of the dispersion law and provides a contribution to the frequency shift of the sound wave @xmath302    the damping rate and other contributions to the frequency shift can be found directly from eq.([pertenergy ] ) by using the wavefunctions @xmath303 ( [ fk ] ) .",
    "the intermediate quasiparticles giving the main contribution to the damping rate and frequency shift have energies @xmath304 , i.e. much larger than the frequency of the considered sound wave , @xmath305 ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , similarly to the case of phonons in a spatially homogeneous condensate , the non - resonant terms ( [ tnsn ] ) , ( [ tnsa ] ) contribute only to the frequency shift . as already mentioned above ,",

    "@xcite ) @xmath315 where @xmath316 is the classical trajectory starting at the phase space points @xmath317 on the ( hyper)surface of constant energy @xmath213 , @xmath318 , and @xmath319    generally speaking , the integration in eq.([deltak1 ] ) is a tedious task as it requires a full knowledge of the classical trajectories on a time scale @xmath320 .",
    "this is also the case in the idealized cylindrical trap , because of coupling between the radial and axial degrees of freedom .",
    "we will rely on the approach which assumes a fast radial motion of quasiparticles compared to their motion in the axial direction and , hence , requires the frequency of the sound wave , @xmath305 , significantly smaller than the radial frequency @xmath284 . then on a time scale @xmath320 the quasiparticles with energies @xmath321 ( which are the most important for the energy shifts and damping of the sound wave ) oscillate many times in the radial direction ,",
    "whereas their axial variables @xmath322 , @xmath323 only slightly change and , hence , can be adiabatically separated from the fast radial variables @xmath324 , @xmath325 . in this case",
    "it is convenient to integrate eq,([deltak1 ] ) over @xmath326 and , using eq.([fk ] ) , represent it in the form @xmath327 where the integration is performed over the entire classically accessible region of the phase space .    since @xmath322 is close to @xmath328 , in the exponent of the integrand we can write @xmath329 , where the axial velocity @xmath330 is obtained from the exact hamiltonian equations of motion by averaging over the fast radial variables : @xmath331 . for the classical radial motion ( @xmath332 ) the averaging procedure simply reduces to integration over @xmath333 under the condition @xmath334 at fixed values of @xmath213 , @xmath335 and @xmath328 , with the weight proportional to the local density of states for the radial motion : @xmath336 where @xmath337 . finally , averaging the function @xmath338 over the fast radial variables and integrating over @xmath339 in eq.([interm ] ) , we obtain @xmath340 the resonant contribution to the frequency shift , given by the real part of eq.([dkf ] ) , after the integration proves to be @xmath341 .",
    "the sum of this quantity with the non - resonant term ( [ dnonres ] ) and @xmath342 ( [ s1 ] ) leads to the frequency shift of the sound wave @xmath343 the imaginary part of eq.([dkf ] ) gives the damping rate @xmath344    except for the numerical coefficients , eqs,([sndshift ] ) , ( [ sd ] ) are similar to eq.([reshomre ] ) , ( [ reshomim ] ) for the damping rate and energy shift of phonons in a spatially homogeneous bose condensate .",
    "this a consequence of the fact that the condensate boundary region practically does not contribute to the damping rate and frequency shift of axially propagating sound waves , in contrast to the case of excitations quasiclassical for both axial and radial degrees of freedom .    in the mit experiment @xcite the characteristic spatial size of created localized excitations was @xmath345 @xmath251 m and , accordingly , so was the initial wavelength of propagating sound .",
    "according to the experimental data , the propagating pulse died out during 25 ms , and after that only the lowest quadrupole excitation characterized by a much loner damping time ( @xmath346 ms ) was observed .",
    "we believe that the attenuation of axially propagating sound in the mit experiment @xcite on the time scale of 25 ms can be well explained as a consequence of damping .",
    "the characteristic frequency of the waves in the packet can be estimated as @xmath347 .",
    "then eq.([sd ] ) gives the damping rate independent of the condensate density @xmath299 . in the mit experiment",
    "the temperature @xmath3480.5 @xmath251k was roughly only twice as large as @xmath26 , which decreases the damping rate by approximately @xmath349 compared to that given by eq.([sd ] ) . in these conditions",
    "we obtain a characteristic damping time of @xmath350 ms , relatively close to the measured value .",
    "the relative change of the sound velocity , @xmath351 , increases with decreasing condensate density @xmath27 .",
    "however , even at the lowest densities of the mit experiment @xcite ( @xmath352 @xmath353 ) the quantity @xmath354 does not exceed @xmath355 and is practically invisible .",
