    "in a remarkable series of experiments in the nineties , sophisticated cooling techniques were used to expose the quantum nature of ultracold dilute gases . for bosons , the realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in 1995 @xcite revealed the importance of the underlying aggregating statistics for the existence of a broken symmetry phase in weakly interacting systems . for fermions ,",
    "the statistics has just the opposite effect . due to the pauli exclusion principle ,",
    "low energy collisions of fermionic particles are strongly suppressed , worsening the thermalization between the atoms and , therefore , making the cooling techniques more involved .",
    "nevertheless , a few years later another milestone experiment was realized in which a quantum degenerate fermi gas was observed @xcite . since then , research with both types of degenerate quantum gases has experienced a strong growth , and different trends have been pursued , each showing interesting and relevant connections to other fields of physics such as atomic , molecular and condensed matter physics .",
    "rotating quantum gases constitute one of these fast growing areas . in the case of bosons in a harmonic trap ,",
    "intensive investigations have been carried out , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . if the rotation frequency @xmath1 is of the order of ( but smaller than ) the radial trapping frequency @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath3 , the rotation is called slow . in this regime , intrinsic properties of rotating systems like the temperature dependence of the moment of inertia @xcite , rotation induced excitations @xcite , and the formation of vortices @xcite have been considered .",
    "if one rotates faster , vortex arrays are created @xcite where small - amplitude oscillations , so called tkachenko modes , have been observed @xcite and theoretically investigated @xcite .",
    "in addition , fast rotating ( @xmath4 ) becs have been linked to fascinating many - body phenomena such as the integer quantum hall effect @xcite or its fractional version @xcite , and are suspected to display quantum phase transitions to non superfluid strongly correlated states @xcite .    in the fast rotation regime ,",
    "experiments in harmonic traps are limited by the loss of confinement due to centrifugal forces when the rotation frequency approaches the axial harmonic trapping frequency . to overcome this problem ,",
    "a. l. fetter suggested adding a quartic term to the trap potential @xcite .",
    "the successful experimental implementation of such a quartic term was carried out in the group of j. dalibard in paris @xcite . in their",
    "set - up a laser is used to stir the quartically trapped condensates , making possible the exploration of many properties of the system such as , for instance , the vortex distribution , the optical density @xcite , and the shape oscillations @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization triggered further theoretical research focusing on bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) .",
    "for instance , their collective oscillations @xcite , thermodynamical @xcite and dynamical @xcite properties have been considered in the presence of the quartic term .",
    "thus , the question arises , what new features come about through the interplay between rotation and fermionic statistics . in a harmonic trap ,",
    "some properties have already been investigated .",
    "for instance , the moment of inertia and its relation to quadrupole oscillations , in a framework valid for bosons and fermions @xcite , and the collective excitations @xcite have been studied . in the superfluid phase ,",
    "formation of vortices @xcite has been observed and a rotation - induced phase separation has been proposed @xcite . in addition , the influence of the landau levels on the density profiles of two - dimensional polarized fermions in the context of the integer quantum hall effect @xcite and the experimental feasibility of fractional quantum hall states @xcite have also been theoretically considered .    in the case of an anharmonic trap , apart from studying the breathing mode in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs)-bec crossover regime @xcite , fermions have not been considered and most of the interesting aspects of the physics of rotating systems remain restricted to pure harmonic confinement . at low temperatures , polarized atomic fermi gases are essentially non - interacting due to pauli blocking and the fact that p - wave interactions are negligible in such systems .",
    "however , due to the fermi pressure , particles tend to avoid the center of the trap , so that , effectively , a statistical interaction arises even in the case of an ideal gas , which bears some analogies with repulsively interacting bosons @xcite .",
    "in this work we are concerned with rotating ideal fermi gases of spin polarized particles rotating with frequency @xmath1 .",
    "we consider the same trap configuration as in the paris experiment , which will be described in detail in section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "in section [ sec:3 ] we outline a general approach to formally justify the semiclassical approximation for calculating the density of states in anharmonic traps .",
    "furthermore , we apply this technique to the paris trap and see that a treatment within the semiclassical approximation is justified . in section [ sec:4 ] we consider ground - state properties of such a system in a similar semiclassical approach .",
    "we start by evaluating the fermi energy for arbitrary rotation , then we obtain the particle density , the momentum distribution , and free expansion time - of - flight absorption pictures . in section [ sec:5 ] temperature effects",
    "are considered and we derive expressions for the grand - canonical thermodynamic properties in terms of incomplete fermi functions .",
    "in addition we analyze analytic low- and high - temperature expansions . for the latter ,",
    "a virial theorem approach is also presented .",
    "section [ sec:6 ] discusses the main results of this work emphasizing the effects of rotation and anharmonicity in comparison to a non - rotating harmonic trap and presents an outlook for the field .",
    "in the following we consider a trap potential which is anharmonic and consists of harmonic axially symmetric magnetic trapping supplemented by an additional gaussian trapping term in the @xmath5-plane .",
    "the gaussian laser beam is approximated by its fourth order taylor series @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the laser intensity and width , respectively .",
    "the radial distance to the origin is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the first term in is just a shift in the energy scale and will be neglected in the following .",
    "the second order term will be absorbed into the harmonic trapping term .",
    "the last term is the one responsible for the quartic confinement and is characterized by the anharmonicity constant @xmath10 .",
    "it is important to notice that the harmonic trapping in the @xmath11-direction is not affected by the gaussian laser potential and is characterized by its harmonic oscillator frequency @xmath12 .",
    "an issue in the field of rotating quantum gases is that the rotation frequency , with which the condensate effectively rotates , might be different from the one of the stirring laser , due to changes in the shape dependent rotation properties of the gas such as the moment of inertia @xcite .",
    "we neglect these effects and assume that a stirring laser can adiabatically add angular momentum to the particles , so that the gas rotates with frequency @xmath1 , yielding an additional centrifugal harmonic term to the trap potential in the co - rotating frame @xcite . under these considerations ,",
    "the rotating anharmonic potential takes the form @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the axial harmonic energy and length scales , respectively , @xmath16 denotes the anisotropy of the trap , @xmath17 represents the anharmonicity of the trap , and @xmath18 is the mass of the atomic species under consideration .",
    "the rotation is taken into account with the parameter @xmath19 . adopting the values given for the paris experiment @xcite , the resulting rotating trap",
    "is then described by the radial harmonic trapping frequency @xmath20 , the axial harmonic trapping frequency @xmath21 , the force constant @xmath22 of the quartic trapping term , the anisotropy @xmath23 , and a tunable rotation frequency @xmath1 induced by the stirring laser .    in the paris experiment ,",
    "a bec was obtained with the bosonic isotope @xmath24 , for which the dimensionless anharmonicity takes the value @xmath25 . since fermionic species like @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "have been sympathetic cooled by using the bosonic atoms @xmath24 @xcite and @xmath28 @xcite , respectively , we consider them likely candidates for experiments with ultracold degenerate fermi gases in the paris trap . for definiteness",
    ", we evaluate all results of this paper for the parameters of the trap of the paris experiment and the @xmath26 species , for which we have @xmath29 ( see table [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "let us discuss the trap potential and some of its peculiarities concerning rotation .",
    "for the moment , we restrict ourselves to the @xmath5-plane . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , for slow rotations , i.e. @xmath30 , the minimum of the potential is located at the origin .",
    "rotating faster one eventually reaches the point where the harmonic confinement vanishes ( @xmath31 ) and the trap is purely quartic .",
    "hereafter this will be called critical rotation .",
    "if the rotation is made even faster , one achieves the supercritical regime , where the harmonic confinement becomes centrifugal and the trap minimum is moved to @xmath32 and , with respect to the origin , has a depth given by @xmath33 which naturally characterizes the anharmonic trap .",
    "the lowest available potential energy is , thus , @xmath34 , in the supercritical case .",

    "in this section we briefly discuss the meaning and the implementation of the semiclassical approximation for a system of particles possessing one - body hamiltonian @xmath49 with the eigenvalue equation @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the @xmath53-th single - particle eigenstate and eigenvalue , respectively .    in view of studying the various thermodynamic properties of the system ,",
    "one is usually interested in evaluating sums of the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is some function of the single - particle energy levels .",
    "the semiclassical approximation consists in considering the energy levels so close to one another that the sum over them can be taken as an integral over a phase space density : @xmath56 to this end we define the density of states @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the dirac delta distribution . in the following",
    "we investigate for the parameters of the table [ tab:1 ] whether it is justified to approximate the density of states semiclassically according to @xmath59,\\label{eq : g-1b}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 denotes the single - particle classical hamiltonian . in systems where the exact energy spectrum is known ,",
    "e.g. a harmonic trap , the validity of this approximation can be determined by comparing and . however , in the case that the energy spectrum is unknown , as for the present anharmonic potential , we must take a different approach to justify the semiclassical approximation . to this end , we determine not only the leading semiclassical approximation @xmath61 , but also its subleading correction @xmath62 . after setting the relevant energy scale of the system , the validity of the semiclassical approximation can be determined by the _ relative _ magnitude of the correction .",
    "we first treat the general case and , then , specialize to the anharmonic trap of the paris experiment .      to obtain the semiclassical expansion of the density of states of the anharmonic potential , we follow the general procedure worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite , which derives the density of states in form of a gradient expansion @xmath63 the first term corresponds to the semiclassical approximation @xmath61 in , which yields after integration over the momenta @xmath64\\dfrac{\\left[e - v({\\bf x})\\right]^{\\frac{d}{2}-1}}{\\gamma(d/2)}.\\label{eq : approx}\\ ] ] the second term is the subleading correction to the density of states @xmath65^{\\frac{d}{2}}\\dfrac{1}{\\gamma(d/2 - 2)}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\int d^{d}x\\,\\theta\\left[e - v({\\bf x})\\right]\\nabla^{2}v({\\bf x})\\left[e - v({\\bf x})\\right]^{\\frac{d}{2}-3}.\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : g1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that , for the physically relevant dimension @xmath66 , the spatial integral diverges due to the behavior of the term @xmath67^{\\frac{d}{2}-3}$ ] at the classical turning points .",
    "this problem can be solved through the method of analytic continuation as demonstrated later by applying to the anharmonic potential .",
    "it remains to determine the energy scales for which the semiclassical approach is supposed to be valid .",
    "at high enough temperatures , the particles are classical .",
    "when the temperature is gradually lowered , or other parameters are changed , classical statistical mechanics is no longer exact . at first",
    ", a semiclassical approach may work , but for certain conditions it may completely fail .",
    "the temperature , particle number , and trap potential parameter scales in which the semiclassical approximation is valid depend on the underlying statistics . for bosons in the gas phase ,",
    "the thermal distribution is characterized by the thermal energy @xmath68 . if this energy is sufficiently larger than the the energy of the single - particle ground - state , the leading semiclassical approximation is valid . at the bec critical temperature @xmath69",
    ", however , the ground - state occupancy becomes macroscopic .",
    "this effect must be treated outside of semiclassics because it corresponds to a broken symmetry state associated to the divergence of the bose distribution @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "we will see explicitly in the case of the anharmonic oscillator that the subleading correction is not negligible for energies near the ground - state energy .",
    "the thermal energy at the critical temperature is thus the relevant energy scale for determining the validity of this approach .    for fermions",
    "the considerations are slightly different . due to the pauli exclusion principle , as @xmath72 the particles in the system do not all drop to the ground - state but rather fill every energy level up to the fermi energy @xmath73 , which is defined as the energy of the highest occupied state .",
    "as the density of states @xmath74 typically increases with a power of @xmath75 , the majority of particles in the system will have energies much larger than the ground - state value and their average energy is of order @xmath73 , even at @xmath76 , provided @xmath42 is large .",
    "therefore , in principle , a spin - polarized fermi gas can be well described at all temperatures in the semiclassical approximation provided the particle number is large enough .",
    "the relevant energy determining the validity of this assertion is simply the fermi energy @xmath73 .",
    "numerical calculations indicate that this is indeed the case @xcite .      to consider the anharmonic potential",
    ", we must first determine explicitly the leading and subleading terms of the semiclassical density of states .",
    "we can , then , apply the leading term to calculate the fermi energy , and with this result return to verify the a priori assumption of the validity of the approximation .",
    "the form of the semiclassical density of states in the anharmonic potential can be found from . performing the spatial integral",
    "we obtain the result @xmath77 where it is meant in this and other equations , that the function takes on nonzero values for @xmath78 only for super - critical rotations .",
    "the density of states for the parameters of the anharmonic trap described in table [ tab:1 ] is shown at several rotation frequencies @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . for subcritical rotations ,",
    "the density of states vanishes for @xmath78 . for supercritical rotations ,",
    "the density of states is nonzero also for @xmath79 , due to the dip in the potential .     for the anisotropy and the anharmonicity of the trap .",
    "the solid lines are from bottom to top at rotations of @xmath80 to @xmath81 in steps of @xmath82 .",
    "the dashed line is the density of states at the critical rotation @xmath83.[fig:2 ] ]    there are two important limiting cases which shed some light on the behavior of the system .",
    "the first one is the harmonic limit @xmath84 , for which we have from @xmath85 which corresponds to the known result @xcite .",
    "note that the harmonic limit is valid only for subcritical rotations ; for supercritical rotations the density of states becomes negative corresponding to an instability due to the fact that particles escape the trap .",
    "the second physically important case is the pure quartic limit in radial confinement .",
    "it is realized by either @xmath86 , i.e. a critical rotation , or @xmath87 , so that the density of states takes the form @xmath88 examining and , we see that the rotation parameter @xmath89 appears in the density of states only in ratios to the anharmonicity parameter @xmath90 . for supercritical rotations , we will find that there is a symmetry between the range of rotations , @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) to @xmath86 ( critical rotation ) , and the range of anharmonicities from small @xmath90 to @xmath93 .",
    "the supercritical properties of the system can thus be seen as an interpolation between the harmonic limit and the pure quartic limit .",
    "we now calculate the subleading semiclassical approximation @xmath62 as given in for the particular case of the anharmonic potential . a direct integration in for @xmath66 yields a divergent result . however , we can rewrite the spatial integral in terms of the beta function @xmath94 for which in ref .",
    "@xcite provides the identity @xmath95 thus , the formally divergent integrals can be treated as finite based on the analytic continuation of the gamma function through the relationship @xmath96 .",
    "to evaluate the integral we need the laplacian of the anharmonic potential , which reads : @xmath97 with this and the full potential given in , we obtain from the first correction to the semiclassical density of states : @xmath98 where , again , the lower line is valid only for supercritical rotations .    to determine the effects of the trap parameters on the relevance of the correction term , we examine the ratio @xmath99 .",
    "we first see that it is in general reduced in both the sub- and supercritical regimes as @xmath100 increases .",
    "likewise , the importance of the correction term decreases as the anharmonicity @xmath90 decreases .",
    "as the correction is largest for low energies , the most interesting case for supercritical rotations is when @xmath78 , where we have    @xmath101^{2 } , \\;\\;\\;\\;-\\delta e",

    "furthermore , we see that the correction diverges as @xmath103 .",
    "however , this divergence is only of the form @xmath104 , and so any interesting integral of the form over the density of states will still have a finite contribution from this correction , provided @xmath105 is not itself divergent . for bose systems , @xmath105 contains a factor of @xmath106^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the phase transition to bose - einstein condensation happens as @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the lowest energy eigenvalue .",
    "thus , in the condensate phase , an integral of the form has an improper lower limit for @xmath105 blows up as @xmath109 , since it is the lowest available energy .",
    "this problem can be overcome by dividing the gas explicitly into a condensate plus thermal particles .",
    "we can now check the validity of the semiclassical approximation in the case of the anharmonic trap .",
    "both the leading and the subleading term are plotted in fig .",

    "we see that the fermi energy also takes on a simple analytic form , @xmath127 where the superscript do stands for donut , in reference to the shape that the gas assumes when all the particles are in this energy interval , as discussed below .",
    "notice that in the ` donut ' regime , for a fixed particle number the fermi energy is set a distance above the trap minimum that is independent of the rotation frequency , but is directly related to the anharmonicity and to the number of particles .",
    "we now have three cases where the fermi energy takes a simple analytic form corresponding to the three interesting rotation regimes : the harmonic limit for subcritical rotations , the pure quartic limit for critical rotations , and the ` donut ' regime for supercritical rotations .",
