    ".    the low metallicity of the young stellar population and the interstellar medium ( ism ) in ngc6822 can be understood as a consequence of the fact that it is a relatively gas - rich galaxy with a mass of m@xmath28  =  1.45@xmath1410@xmath29m@xmath9 @xcite and a total stellar mass of m@xmath30  =  0.83@xmath21.70@xmath1410@xmath29m@xmath9 @xcite .",

    "( in prep . ) , the ratio @xmath36 can be empirically determined from the fact that the metallicity of the young stellar population in the solar neighbourhood is solar , with a mass fraction of z@xmath9  =  0.014 . with a stellar - to - gas mass column density of 4.48 in the solar neighbourhood",
    "@xcite one then obtains @xmath36  =  0.0082  =  0.59z@xmath9 with an uncertainty of 15% dominated by the 0.05dex uncertainty of the metallicity determination of the young population .",
    "accounting for the presence of helium and metals in the neutral interstellar gas we can turn the observed hi mass in ngc6822 into a gas mass via m@xmath37  =  1.36m@xmath28 and use the simple closed - box model to predict a metallicity of [ z ]  =  @xmath20.44 to @xmath20.69 , in good agreement with our value obtained from rsg spectroscopy .    as discussed above ,",
    "the older stellar population of agb stars has a metallicity roughly 0.8dex lower than the rsgs . in the framework of the simple closed - box model",
    "this would correspond to a period in time where the ratio of stellar to gas mass was @xmath40.1 ( much lower than the present value of 0.42 to 0.86 ) .",
    "the present star - formation rate of ngc6822 is @xmath40.02 m@xmath9yr@xmath24 . at such a level of star formation",
    "it would have taken 5gyr to produce the presently observed stellar mass and to arrive at the average metallicity of the young stellar population from that of the agb stars ( of course , again relying on the simple closed - box model ) .",
    "evidence suggests that the star - formation rate was substantially lower in the past @xcite , therefore , the build up of the observed stellar mass would have taken correspondingly longer .",
    "given the irregularities present in the stellar and gaseous morphology of ngc6822 , this galaxy may not be a good example of a closed - box system ; however , it is remarkable that the closed - box model reproduces the observed metallicity so closely .",
    "effective temperatures have been derived for 11 rsgs from our observed sample in ngc6822 . to date , this represents the fourth data set used to derive stellar parameters in this way and the first with kmos .",

    "dashed grey lines show solar metallicity evolutionary models including rotation .[fig : hrd ] , width=340 ]    from these figures , we see no evidence for significant variations in the average temperatures of rsgs with respect to metallicity .",
    "this is in contrast with current evolutionary models which display a change of @xmath4450k , for a m  =  15m@xmath9 model , over a range of solar to smc - like metallicities  .    for solar metallicity ,",
    "observations in perseus ob-1 are in good agreement with the models ( see fig . 9 in",
    "however , at smc - like metallicity , the end - points of the models are systematically warmer than the observations .",
    "the temperature of the end - points of the evolutionary models of massive stars could depend on the choice of the convective mixing - length parameter .",
    "the fact that the models produce a higher temperature than observed could imply that the choice of a solar - like mixing - length parameter does not hold for higher mass stars at lower metallicity .",
    "lastly , we note that the average spectral type of rsgs tends towards an earlier spectral type with decreasing metallicity over this range @xcite .",

    "the strengths of tio bands are dependent upon metallicity which means that the spectral classification for rsgs at a constant temperature will differ @xcite .",
    "therefore , although historically spectral type has been used as a proxy for temperature , this assumption does not provide an accurate picture for rsgs in differing environments .      as mentioned in section  [ sub : target_selection ] , massive agb stars are potential contaminants to our sample .",

    "four of our analysed stars have @xmath10-band magnitudes fainter than this limit , but excluding the results for these does not significantly alter any of our results .",

    "the presence of a metallicity gradient among the young population within ngc6822 a larger systematic study of rsgs is needed .",
    "the chemical abundances of the young and old stellar populations of ngc6822 are well explained by a simple closed - box chemical evolution model .",
    "however , while an interesting result , we note that the closed - box model is unlikely to be a good assumption for this galaxy given its morphology .",
    "the effective temperatures of those in this study are compared with rsgs analysed using the same method in previous studies .",
    "using results which span 0.55dex in metallicity ( solar to smc ) within four galaxies , we find no evidence for a systematic variation in average effective temperature with respect to metallicity .",
    "this is in contrast with evolutionary models which , for a similar change in metallicity , predict a shift in the temperature of rsgs of up to 450k .",
