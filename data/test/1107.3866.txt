    "the method for the @xmath0-body simulations is described in section [ sec : n - body ] .",
    "the timescales of binary formation are very much smaller than those of cluster evolution as a whole .",
    "this means that the need for high - resolution data around binary formation can not be simply extended to a full recording of the whole cluster evolution history with the same level of detail .",
    "we have to be quite selective in deciding what to store and what to throw out .",
    "our strategy of data compression is described in section [ sec : strategy ] .",
    "we have followed the dynamical evolution of five star clusters with equal - mass stars without primordial binaries .",
    "our first three clusters have about a thousand stars , @xmath1 , another has @xmath2 , and the last one has @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "their initial stellar distributions are given by plummer s model .",
    "stars in the three clusters with @xmath1 are generated with different random seeds , which we label here as seeds 1 , 2 , and 3 .    for the @xmath0-body simulations , we have used gorilla , an @xmath0-body simulation code for star clusters @xcite .",
    "this code uses a fourth - order hermite scheme with individual timesteps @xcite for the time integration .",
    "the internal orbits of isolated binaries are approximated as kepler motion .",
    "for further details , see tf09 .",
    "the accuracy parameter @xmath5 , and its value at startup , @xmath6 , were set to @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "we have adopted the standard @xmath0-body units , @xmath9 , @xcite , where @xmath10 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the total mass and virial radius of the cluster at the start of the simulation .",
    "we have performed the above @xmath0-body simulations on one node of the first cluster at the center for computational sciences in university of tsukuba @xcite .",
    "each node of the first cluster is equipped with blade - grape , a special purpose computer for @xmath0-body simulations @xcite .",
    "we have caught the moment of binary formation manually , for each simulation . after determining the overall evolution of each cluster by means of an @xmath0-body simulation",
    "as described in the previous section , we have plotted the time evolution of the number of binaries , shown in figure  [ fig : nb ] . to be specific ,",
    "we have disregarded binaries with only modest binding energy , since many of them dissolved again before getting a chance to harden indefinitely .",
    "we have chosen our cut - off at @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the average stellar kinetic energy in the cluster , i.e. @xmath15 , at time @xmath16 , at the start of the simulation .",
    "the binding energy is expressed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the masses of the binary components , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the separation and relative velocity between them .",
    "the time in these figures is scaled by the initial half - mass relaxation time .",
    "the half - mass relaxation time is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a half - mass radius of a cluster , and @xmath24 in the units at @xmath16 .",
    "after thus establishing the exact time of the formation of the first @xmath13 binary , we have done a complete rerun of the same simulation , taking snapshots in much higher time resolution just before and after the moment of binary formation , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : nb ] . since the binary is formed in or around the cluster core , it is sufficient to take snapshots only of the core regions .",
    "the combination of both temporal and spatial data reduction resulted in orders of magnitude savings in memory needed to store the history of stellar motions around the binary formation events .",
    "we have taken snapshots at very small intervals of @xmath25 , only 1% of the instantaneous core crossing time @xmath26 , given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the core radius , and @xmath29 is the stellar velocity dispersion in the core .",
    "for relatively large numbers of core stars , we have only included those in our snapshots , but whenever the number of stars in the core fell below a critical value @xmath30 , we have included the @xmath30 nearest stars around the density center .",
    "our choice for @xmath30 depends on the number of stars in the simulation : @xmath31 ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath32 ( @xmath2 ) , and @xmath33 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the density center is defined by the procedure described in @xcite ( ch85 ) , as modified by mhm90 , in which a density around a given star is defined by using the distance to the sixth nearest star .    for typical snapshots ,",
    "most stars are not synchronized to the time of that snapshot . in those cases ,",
    "we have derived their positions and velocities through extrapolation , using a predictor given by taylor series up to the first - order time derivatives of their accelerations , so - called jerk .",
    "we summarize the data of the snapshot files , one for each rerun , in table [ tab : snapshot ] .",
    "it is clear that the file size is quite modest ; the largest value is about @xmath34 gbyte , for @xmath3 , while smaller by almost two orders of magnitude for the other runs .",
    "reasons for the rapid increase of file size with @xmath0 are the fact that core crossing time decreases for the same selection of time interval in @xmath0-body time units , and the increase of the number of stars that we save for larger @xmath0 values .",
    "the fact that the @xmath35 runs have a file size that is not much smaller than the @xmath36 run stems from the more conservative approach with which we started the former runs , saving data for a longer time span .",

    "as is well known , binary formation is closely related to the evolution of a cluster core . when core collapse proceeds , more than two stars interact simultaneously because of the high stellar density in the core . as a result of these interactions ,",
    "a binary is formed . in this section ,",
    "we investigate the details of core evolution around the time of binary formation .",
    "figure  [ fig : rc_n01k ]  [ fig : rc_n16k ] show the time evolution of core radii of the clusters , and the moment of first binary formation .",
    "the core radii are derived in the same way as ch85 modified by mhm90 , in which a density around a given star is defined from the sixth nearest star . in the panels with maximum zoom factor",
    "( zoom-@xmath38 for @xmath1 ; zoom-@xmath39 for @xmath2 ; and zoom-@xmath40 for @xmath3 ) time is scaled by the instantaneous value of the core crossing time .",
    "we can express this ` co - moving time ' @xmath41 as @xmath42 @xmath41 effectively presents the accumulation of time on a clock with variable speed , in such a way that each increment in time is scaled by the value of the core crossing time at that particular moment . in this way ,",
    "the very brief periods of deepest core collapse are guaranteed to be magnified so as to be completely resolved in time .",
    "the first binaries are formed during the time interval between the two dashed lines in the panels with maximum zoom factor .",
    "as expected , the time at which the first binaries are formed is comparable for the different runs , when expressed in @xmath0-body time units : the first binary in each run is formed between @xmath43 and @xmath44 . at the time of the formation of the first @xmath13 binary , the core radii are @xmath45 ",
    "@xmath46 for the @xmath1 runs with seed 1 and 2 , @xmath47 ",
    "@xmath48 for the @xmath1 run with seed 3 , @xmath49 ",
    "@xmath50 for the @xmath2 run , and @xmath51  @xmath52 for the @xmath3 run ( see the panels with maximum zoom factor in figure  [ fig : rc_n01k ]  [ fig : rc_n16k ] ) .    when inspecting the zoom-@xmath34 panels of figures  [ fig : rc_n01k ] , [ fig : rc_n04k ] , and [ fig : rc_n16k ] , the core radii around the time pointed at by the arrows take on locally minimal values during intervals of @xmath53 before and after these times .",
    "this can be further investigated by following the time evolution of the maximum values of the core radii during fluctuations on smaller timescales than the initial half - mass relaxation time .",
    "the maximum values for the core radii , around the times pointed at by the arrows , are @xmath54 for the @xmath35 runs , @xmath50 for the @xmath36 run , and @xmath45 for the @xmath55 run .",
    "in contrast , corresponding values at other times during this @xmath53 period are @xmath56 for the @xmath35 runs , @xmath57 for the @xmath36 run , and @xmath58 for the @xmath55 run .    looking in further detail at the core radii around the time of binary formation",
    ", there is no precise correlation between binary formation and core radii .",
    "in fact , core radii at times during which no binary is formed are just about as small as core radii at binary formation time , something that is especially clear in the @xmath36 and @xmath55 runs ( see zoom-@xmath59 and zoom-@xmath39 of figure  [ fig : rc_n04k ] , and zoom-@xmath39 of figure  [ fig : rc_n16k ] , respectively ) .",
    "core radii are almost constant during @xmath60 in the case of the @xmath36 run ( see zoom-@xmath59 of figure  [ fig : rc_n04k ] ) and @xmath61 in the case of the @xmath55 run ( see zoom-@xmath39 of figure  [ fig : rc_n16k ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the binaries are formed during intervals much less than @xmath62 ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath63 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the timescale on which core radii small enough to form a binary ( about @xmath64 for @xmath36 and @xmath52 for @xmath55 ) persist is several times longer than binary formation timescale .",
    "we are clearly dealing with events with low probability , even at these high densities , occurring stochastically .    on the way toward binary formation ,",
    "the core radii sometimes become smaller than any other time by a factor of ten , for example @xmath65 in the @xmath1 run with seed 1 , @xmath66 in the @xmath1 run with seed 2 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the @xmath3 run .",
    "these decrease of core radii is not correlated with binary formation .",
    "such decrease of core radii occurs at the other time .",
    "figure  [ fig : nc ] shows the time evolution of the number of stars in the core around the time of binary formation .",
    "note that the numbers of stars in the core around that time fluctuates by roughly a factor or @xmath69 , with significant differences between different runs .",
    "this in itself already indicates that a homogeneous background density assumption for three - body binary formation breaks down .",
    "as we will now see in detail , binaries are indeed formed by processes other than simple three - body encounters .      for more than 35 years",
    ", the conventional wisdom for the formation of the first hard binary in core collapse has postulated a relatively straightforward picture . while the density of the core increases , near - simultaneous three - body encounters become more and more likely .",
    "these can lead to the formation of binaries , where the third star picks up the excess energy , leaving the other two stars bound .",
    "subsequent encounters are most likely to destroy these newly formed soft binaries , but occasionally a soft binary hardens against the odds , and then becomes stable when its binding energy exceeds several @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to check this conventional wisdom , using the information we have gathered about orbits of stars and the time evolution of the pair - wise distances between stars in the core .",
    "first , let us have a look at the orbits of stars involving binary formation in figure  [ fig : xyz ] .",
    "apparently , the binary in the @xmath2 run , which presents an unusually simple formation case , is formed through an encounter among three single stars .",
    "the red , blue , and dark green stars simultaneously approach each other .",
    "subsequently , the red and blue stars compose of a binary , and the dark green star is ejected from them .",
    "this indeed corresponds to the classical picture for binary formation . on the other hand , many stars involve the formation of the binaries in all the other runs .",
    "their orbits are too complicated to determine the mechanism of binary formation from these figures , even though they already suggest a mechanism quite different from the classical picture .    in order to find out more about what is actually happening ,",
    "we have plotted the time evolution of the pair - wise distances between all stars in the core , during a very small period of time just before binary formation .",
    "figures  [ fig : sep_n01k_seed01 ]  [ fig : sep_n16k_seed01 ] show the interactions of stars shown in figure  [ fig : xyz ] in further detail .",
    "each separate panel shows the distances of one particular star to all other stars in the core . for each curve in a given panel ,",
    "the color of the curve indicates the identity of the star to which the pair - wise distance is plotted .",
    "when some of the curves are intermittent , for example the nearest black curve in the gray panel of figure  [ fig : sep_n01k_seed02 ] , it is an indication that one or another of the two stars in a pair have temporarily moved outside the cluster core .",
    "as described in section [ sec : strategy ] , we have not recorded the data for stars outside the cluster core .",
    "we now describe the evolution histories in detail",
    ". we will start with figure  [ fig : sep_n01k_seed01 ] , where the results for the @xmath1 run are given , for seed 1 . just before @xmath71 ,",
    "an encounter involving four stars ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ) leads directly to the formation of a hard binary ( 1 , 5 ) . a little later , just after @xmath72 , that binary dissolves in a complicated dance involving five stars ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 ) , and soon thereafter , around @xmath73 , a new hard binary ( 2,3 ) emerges from this dance .",
    "finally , at @xmath74 , a direct three - body exchange leads to the first hard binary ( 1 , 2 ) with an energy @xmath75 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sep_n01k_seed02 ] shows the results for the @xmath1 run with seed 2 . at the start of the interval depicted , there already is a hard binary ( 8) that was formed earlier ; since this binary is only slightly perturbed during this interval , retaining its identity , we have not numbered its two members separately : number 8 indicates both stars as a unit .",
    "also present at the start of the interval is a mildly hard binary ( 4 , 7 ) which by @xmath76 dissolves during an encounter with three other stars ( 1 , 2 , 5 ) .",
    "out of this five - body interaction emerges , soon thereafter around @xmath77 , another mildly hard binary ( 1 , 2 ) .",
    "this new binary undergoes various perturbations by passing stars , hardening gradually at first .",
    "then , at @xmath74 , a close encounter with a single star ( 3 ) leads to a sudden increase in binding energy , by a factor of two to three .",
    "figure  [ fig : sep_n01k_seed03 ] shows a similar picture for the @xmath1 run with seed 3 .",
    "around @xmath78 , a three - body encounter ( 2 , 3 , 4 ) leads to the formation of a mildly hard binary ( 2 , 3 ) .",
    "a little later , at @xmath79 , a simultaneous encounter between this binary and two single stars ( 1 and 5 ) leads to the formation of a significantly harder binary ( 1 , 2 ) . at @xmath74 ,",
    "a close encounter with a single star ( 3 ) leads to a sudden increase in binding energy , by about a factor of two .",
    "figure  [ fig : sep_n04k_seed01 ] shows the @xmath2 run .",
    "in contrast to the preceding three cases , here hard binary formation is much simpler . at @xmath74 three stars ( 1 , 2 , 3 )",
    "have a simultaneous close encounter , leading directly to the formation of the first hard binary ( 1 , 2 ) with an energy @xmath75 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sep_n16k_seed01 ] , for the @xmath3 run , is again far more complicated . at @xmath77 , four single stars ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 8) meet , producing a mildly hard binary ( 5 , 8) . at @xmath80",
    "the binary dissolves in a many - body dance involving several other stars that keep interacting until at @xmath81 a new binary ( 1 , 2 ) is formed ; at the last step in its formation mainly three stars ( 1 , 2 , 5 ) were involved . finally , at @xmath74 , a close encounter with a single star ( 3 ) leads to a sudden increase in binding energy , by a factor of two to three .",
    "we conclude from these five cases that direct three - body binary formation is relatively rare . in the one case that we observed , in figure  [ fig : sep_n04k_seed01 ] , it led to a binary with a binding energy of more than @xmath82 , a very different picture than the gradual hardening of a soft binary .    in the other four cases that we studied ,",
    "the situation was quite a bit more complicated .",
    "in all of those cases , there were episodes in which at least four or five stars were simultaneously involved in close encounters that played a role in the formation of the first really hard binary .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that core collapse of star clusters gives rise to the formation of hard binaries via far more complicated processes than have been hitherto considered .",
    "most importantly , the traditional approximation of binary formation through simultaneous encounters of three bodies offers a vastly oversimplified picture of what really happens . typically , more stars are strongly involved , dynamically , in a complex multi - body dance that in no way can be disentangled to lead to a hierarchy with only three stars in the center .",
    "we have found only one exception , among the five cases studied in great detail . even in that case",
    ", the traditional picture of slow hardening of an initially quite soft binary does nt apply .",
    "rather , that three - body process of binary formation produced a rather hard binary very quickly , without subsequent hardening encounters with other stars .",
    "we can point to a single reason for the fact that the two core assumptions ( 3-body encounters , and gradual hardening ) of the traditional scenario for hard binary formation turn out to be unrealistic .",
    "the main reason for the break - down of those assumptions is the very small core at the moment of core collapse .",
    "what we have found is that , typically , the core at that time contains less than 10 stars , and often only 5 or so stars  so few that a precise measure of the actual number of stars becomes difficult . given the discrete nature of core stars , the use of continuum properties like density for a population of only 5 stars is obviously rather problematic .    if core bounce would occur at somewhat larger core sizes , with cores containing twenty to thirty stars or more , the assumptions of three - body encounters and gradual hardening may well have been correct . following",
    "the path breaking analytical investigation of the role of binaries by @xcite in the seventies , subsequent analytical work in the eighties seems to suggest that core sizes during core bounce remained large enough to ensure heggie s assumptions .",
    "for example , from table 2 of @xcite , equilibrium values of core sizes between @xmath1 and @xmath3 range between twenty and sixty stars .",
    "a more detailed analysis in @xcite gave rise to his equation ( iv.8 ) suggesting a core size at deep bounce large enough for the core to contain dozens of stars .",
    "our simulations , in contrast , suggest that deep core collapse causes the number of stars in the core to dip below ten in all cases , independent of the number @xmath0 of stars for the cluster as a whole . during the final stages before the deepest collapse ,",
    "the remainder of the cluster is effectively frozen , on the local time scale of the most central regions , and even the order of magnitude of @xmath0 may become irrelevant .",
    "we have demonstrated this for the range @xmath83 to @xmath84 , and we predict a very similar behavior for larger @xmath0 values , up to @xmath85 .",
    "it is an interesting question , why the analytic estimates for the core size at the time of core bounce have overestimated the number of stars in the core @xmath86 by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "our results indicate @xmath87 while the analytic estimates have predicted results more like @xmath88 .",
    "one possible reason could be the breakdown of the instantaneous approximation for interactions , used in analytic treatments . with the timescale for formation and subsequent hardening of binaries being comparable to the timescale of core contraction , we may need to extend the analytical approach .",
    "we are currently looking into these questions in more detail , continuing the investigations reported here .",
