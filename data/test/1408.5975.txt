    "similarly , the central engines of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are surrounded by dusty `` tori '' @xcite .",
    "since optical and ultraviolet lights are very easily obscured by the torus , the most complete search for agns can be made by detecting hard x - rays from the central engine or infrared emission from the heated dust . utilizing x - ray data of the chandra deep field south",
    ", @xcite reported that the fraction of `` compton - thick '' agns ( those with absorption column densities of @xmath6@xmath7 ) increases with redshift from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "this fact implies that the level of dust - obscuration of agn may be correlated to the star formation activity , which has a peak at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite gathered all available _ spitzer _ spectra of local compton - thick agns and found strong starburst ( sb ) features in their average infrared spectrum , suggesting that sb activity and highly obscured tori are somehow coupled each other .",
    "@xcite also reported the same trend for buried agns with small opening angles of tori (  new type ",

    "although hard x - rays are useful to search for obscured agns , extremely heavily buried agns with @xmath11@xmath7 are difficult to be detected due to flux attenuation by repeated comptonization even at energies above 10 kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "candidates of galaxies that host such buried agns are infrared galaxies , defined as those having large infrared luminosities ( ) with @xmath12 . among infrared galaxies ,",
    "those in the range @xmath13 are called luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and more luminous ones in the range @xmath14 are called ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "their bolometric luminosities are dominated by the infrared emission , suggesting that very luminous heating sources are surrounded by dust and then the heated dust re - emits in the infrared band .",
    "the hidden energy sources are believed to be either sb , agn , or both . disentangling the energy sources of infrared galaxies is crucial to unveil the history of dust obscured star formation and smbh growth in the universe @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied agn activity in u / lirgs on the basis of optical observations .",
    "they showed that the fraction of agns increases with infrared luminosities in the range of @xmath15 .",
    "one caveat of their optical diagnostics is that one can not identify buried agns embedded in dust - tori with very small opening angles where no significant narrow line regions can be formed . unlike the agns which are optically - classified type-2 seyfert , such buried agns are elusive to conventional optical spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "after the launch of _ spitzer _ , the agn activity in local u / lirgs has been also addressed in the infrared band .",
    "@xcite observed ulirgs with _",
    "spitzer_/irs 58  @xmath0 m spectroscopy , and investigated both the sb and agn contributions by fitting sb / agn templates to the spectra .",
    "they found the increasing agn significance with infrared luminosity , confirming the same trend reported from the optical studies .",
    "@xcite observed the 538  @xmath0 m spectra of lirgs with _",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they confirmed that the agn energetic contribution to the total power increases with infrared luminosity from @xmath16 .",
    "infrared 2.55 @xmath0 m spectroscopy is another powerful tool to study optically - elusive buried agns in u / lirgs .",
    "one advantage of this band is that dust extinction is much lower than in the optical band @xcite and is similar to that in the 513 @xmath0 m band @xcite .",
    "another great advantage is that sb and agn activity can be distinguished based on the spectral features .",
    "first , strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission , a pure star formation tracer , is located at 3.3  @xmath0 m in sb galaxies , while pure agns exhibit pah - feature free spectra due to the effects that 1 ) the x - ray emission destroying the pahs , and 2 ) the strong continuum emission originating from agn hot - dust diminishes this feature @xcite .",
    "sb galaxies generally show large 3.3  @xmath0 m pah equivalent widths of @xmath17  nm , which never go down below 40  nm .",
    "thus , objects with @xmath18  nm may be classified as galaxies that harbor buried agns . in sb / agn composite galaxies ,",
    "strong pah emission can be observed because the agn can not destroy the pah molecules located in the outer ( @xmath19  pc ) region from the central engine due to shielding by dust and gas .",
    "however , strong agn continuum makes ew@xmath20 smaller , well below @xmath21  nm . using this method , many authors reported the strong sign of buried agns in ulirgs @xcite and lirgs @xcite .",
    "another key feature in the 2.55  @xmath0 m band is the continuum slope @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "sb galaxies have blue continuum slopes ( @xmath24 ) in this band due to the contribution of the stellar photospheric continuum .",
    "conversely , galaxies with agns have hot - dust emission heated by agns , which produces a red continuum ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this method was first reported by @xcite and successfully applied to ulirgs @xcite and lirgs @xcite . @xcite",
    "combined the two methods ( @xmath26  nm and/or @xmath27 ) to find buried agns from a sample of u / lirgs showing no agn signatures in the optical spectra .",
    "they found that the fraction of buried agns increases with infrared luminosity in the range of @xmath28 .",
    "in this paper , we expand the studies of u / lirgs by @xcite into a lower infrared luminosity range , by including normal infrared galaxies ( irgs ) with @xmath29 , where comprehensive studies are still missing due to the limited sample .",
    "this is because l / irgs have spatially more extended infrared emission ( @xmath30  kpc , corresponding to @xmath31several arcseconds at @xmath32 ) compared with ulirgs @xcite , and therefore slit spectroscopy with ground based telescopes could miss their extended emission .",
    "slit - less spectroscopy of infrared camera ( irc ; * ? ? ?",

    "since agn tori have peak emission at the mir band , 12  @xmath0 m galaxy catalog could tend to include more agns than in far - infrared selected samples .",
    "indeed , a majority of the @xcite catalog ( 64 out of 76 sources ) are optically seyfert galaxies .",
    "therefore , we gather the 12 optically non - seyfert starburst galaxies from it . in summary , we select a sufficiently large number of non - seyfert infrared galaxies ( 132 sources ) as our `` parent '' sample to be followed - up with _ akari_. the redshifts of all the sources in the above catalogs are distributed within @xmath38 .    , title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "observation was conducted with the irc infrared spectrograph @xcite on board _ akari _ @xcite . the spectra in the 2.55  @xmath0 m band were taken with the ng grism mode .",

    "spectral analysis was conducted in a standard manner by using the idl data reduction package for _ akari _ irc spectra .",
    "the dark - subtraction , linearity correction , and flat - field correction were performed using this idl package .",

    "there is a clear boundary of distribution of the dust temperature around @xmath339  k. this supports our criterion that agns should have high dust temperatures ( @xmath338  k ) and are well distinguishable from sbs .",
    "interestingly , many infrared galaxies with large pah equivalent widths ( ew@xmath340  nm ) show high dust temperatures ( @xmath341  k ) .",
    "one reason could be that because of the large aperture of _ akari_/irc and less luminous nucleus emission in these galaxies , the spectra contain relatively large contribution of 3.3  @xmath0 m pah emission in the host galaxies where pah molecules are not destroyed by agn x - ray photons .",
    "this effect works to increase the pah equivalent width , and hence the pah diagnostic could miss buried agns .",

    "thus , the alternative criterion for detecting agns can be @xmath350  erg s@xmath35 instead of @xmath348  k . in summary",
    ", we conclude that the hot - dust agn diagnostic is a better method for finding buried agns in the _ akari _ irc band .",
    "+      one motivation of our study is to reveal how frequently buried agns exist in infrared galaxies .",

    "the left and right panels show the results based on the pah agn diagnostic and on the torus - dust agn diagnostic , respectively . as discussed above , the latter diagnostic is more complete than the former for finding buried agns from infrared galaxies .",
    "therefore , we discuss the result of the right panel hereafter .    in total , we detect 14 buried agns out of the 22 infrared galaxies without any agn signs in the optical band .",
    "we also find a clear trend that the fraction of buried agn increases with infrared luminosity .",
    "while only 17% ( 1 out of 6 sources ) of the irgs contain buried agns , the u / lirgs contain them almost ubiquitously ( @xmath351% for lirgs and @xmath352% for ulirgs ) .",
    "our results for u / lirgs are consistent with those obtained by @xcite within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "although most of the irgs are selected from the 12  @xmath0 m galaxy catalog , which is sensitive to torus - dust emission , an agn is detected only from one source out of the five targets .",
    "the high agn fraction in u / lirgs may be related with their high merger rates .",
    "there is strong observational evidence that most of u / lirgs have experienced merging or strong galaxy - galaxy interactions @xcite .",
    "the mergers can induce strong sb within the galaxies , which also make galactic gas fall into the galactic center and trigger agn activity obscured by dust @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that infrared galaxies with signs of recent merger drastically increase at @xmath353 toward a higher luminosity range .",
    "this result is in accordance with our finding that the buried agn fraction drastically increases from @xmath354 .     as a function of infrared luminosity .",
    "open circles / triangles / squares represent ulirgs / lirgs / irgs with agn signs , respectively . filled triangle / square represents lirgs / irgs without agn signs , respectively .",
    "note that all ulirgs in our sample are diagnosed to have buried agns .",
    "[ fig-5],title=\"fig : \" ] +    we confirm the dependence of the agn fraction on luminosity by investigating the ratio between the 3.3  @xmath0 m pah luminosity ( @xmath355 ) and total infrared luminosity @xmath356 .",
    "pure sb galaxies generally have a constant ratio @xmath357 .",
    "if an agn exists inside the galaxy , the ratio becomes smaller because x - rays from the agn destroy pah molecules and the infrared continuum luminosity is increased by the torus - dust emission .",
    "figure  5 plots @xmath358 as a function of infrared luminosity for our sample . as noted",
    ", it decreases with infrared luminosity , especially at @xmath359 .",
    "we also find that the sources with small @xmath360 ratios match to those with buried agn signs , supporting the above idea .",
    "note that there is a possibility that this trend may be caused by the destruction of small pah molecules by major mergers @xcite rather than by agns .",
    "nevertheless , since all the sources with @xmath361 show buried agn signs , the conservative criterion @xmath362 could be phenomenologically used as another diagnostic for finding buried agns .",
    "our second motivation is to determine the energetic importance of agns in these infrared galaxies .",
    "as discussed in section  5.1 , the luminosity contribution from dust blackbody component ( @xmath363 ) predominantly originates from agn - heated dust , and the luminosity contribution of sb - heated dust to @xmath363 is negligible .",
    "thus , using the best - fit blackbody parameters obtained by the spectral fit , we can estimate the total luminosity from agn - heated dust and hence its ratio to the total infrared luminosity .",
    "figure  6 shows the averaged fraction of agn power to the total infrared luminosity for irgs , lirgs , and ulirgs .",
    "as noticed , the agn contribution increases with infrared luminosity , while the values are quite small , @xmath364% in irgs , @xmath365% in lirgs , and @xmath366% in ulirgs .",
    "this suggests that the bulk of the infrared emission originates from sb , not from agns in these galaxies .",
    "one caveat for this result is that we can not completely exclude the possibility that the estimated luminosity of @xmath367 might be partially originated from the torus - dust if it has an extreme temperature distribution .",
    "we thus calculate the averaged @xmath368 ratio to check if it could have a significant contribution .",
    "we find @xmath369% , suggesting that the main results above would not be affected , even if the observed very hot ( @xmath370  k ) dust component were totally due to the agn emission .",
    "another caveat for interpreting this result is the selection bias for our sample , which consists of optically non - seyfert galaxies .",
    "previous studies based on samples including optically seyfert agns found larger average agn contribution to the total infrared luminosity , 1015% in lirgs @xcite and 1540% in ulirgs @xcite .",
    "our results are in good agreement with those by @xcite within the errors , who obtained the agn to total luminosity ratio of 68% in lirgs and 1119% in ulirgs , using a similar sample to ours that preferentially includes optically non - seyfert infrared galaxies .",
    "they calculated the agn contribution by performing sed fit with the decompir package @xcite .",
    "this method requires infrared sed data covering the far - infrared band , while our method only uses the _ akari _",
    "2.55  @xmath0 m spectra .",
    "this supports that our simple assumption in the spectral model ( ie , single blackbody for dust emission ) works well in estimating the agn luminosity .",
    "this simple method will have a great advantage in the era of _ jwst _ , because we can apply our method to high-@xmath371 galaxies by observing the rest 2.55.0  @xmath0 m band ( 5.010.0  @xmath0 m at @xmath372 and 7.515.0  @xmath0 m at @xmath373 ) with _",

    "the sb also triggers agn activity , which continues from @xmath394 to @xmath395 .",

    "<S> the energy contribution from agns in the total infrared luminosity is only @xmath5 7% in lirgs and @xmath5  20% in ulirgs , suggesting that the majority of the infrared luminosity originates from starburst activity . using the pah emission </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the luminosity relation between star formation and agn . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these infrared galaxies exhibit higher star formation rates than optically selected seyfert galaxies with the same agn luminosities , implying that infrared galaxies could be an early evolutionary phase of agn . </S>"
