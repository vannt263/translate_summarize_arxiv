    "there are many kinds of networks including probably the most influential network of all , the world wide web @xcite .",
    "this network is a popular one to analyze because of its size and easy accessibility for statistical analysis .",
    "however , there are many other networks that share some of the properties of the web and some that do not . among these networks",
    "we find social networks @xcite , collaboration nets @xcite , industrial and business related networks @xcite , transportation nets @xcite and many biological related nets such as food , ecological , and protein interaction networks @xcite and neural networks @xcite .",
    "the mathematical description of networks started with the fundamental works of erds and rnyi @xcite , which in the absence of reliable data on large networks were rarely compared to real networks .",
    "recently , the computational boom has provided us an increasing number of types of networks and more data on these networks .",
    "one of the most exciting discoveries is the scale - free structures of certain evolving networks @xcite .",
    "these nets have power law degree distribution , where only a few vertices have many connections to the others and the rest of the graph is rarely connected .",
    "to explain the origin of this scale free structure of networks barabsi _",
    "et al_. @xcite suggested the mechanism of preferential attachment and emphasized the key role of growth . in their model the probability of a new node connecting to an existing node is proportional to the degree of the target node .",
    "variations on this model include networks where there is aging of nodes , nonlinear attachment probabilities , and re - wiring are allowed .",
    "probably the most obvious feature of real networks that is missing from most of the models studied by mathematicians and physicists are characteristics of individual nodes in real networks which influence the connection probability .",
    "thus , if the nodes represent individual persons , it is obvious that in many circumstances two people are more likely to become connected in some form of relationship because of the nature of their individual characteristics .",
    "our model is motivated by the need to incorporate this idea .",
    "a similar idea was used in a preferential attachment model by bianconi and barabsi @xcite who assigned to each new node a fitness parameter . in their model a larger fitness parameter may overcompensate the smaller probability of attachment .    in our study",
    "we propose a simple model of growing networks whose statistical properties are identical to a more complicated model containing nodes with distinct characteristics .",
    "we will calculate the edge distribution of the growing network , the distribution of cluster sizes and the emergence of a giant cluster .",
    "we will also show how the number of attempted connections made when a new node is added determines the position and type of the phase transition as well as the cluster size distribution .",
    "we first consider a social network model where each node has individual characteristics or traits .",
    "each node that is added to the network is assigned a permanent set of random traits which could be coded as an ordered binary string or vector of length @xmath8 . when a node is added it chooses randomly @xmath9 possible partners from the already existing nodes , or if there are less then @xmath10 ( because the simulation has not yet reached time step @xmath11 ) it chooses all the existing nodes as possible partners . a trait distance between the new node and one of its possible partners",
    "is calculated based on their trait vectors ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) using a distance measure , @xmath14 , such as the hamming distance .",
    "then a connection is formed between the two nodes with a probability determined from a given probability distribution over the distance function @xmath15 .",
    "different functions , @xmath16 , correspond to different soicopsychological situations .",
    "thus , if we wish to model the case where people are more likely to link together if they have similar traits , then @xmath16 would be a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath17 .",
    "for this case , the simplest @xmath16 would be to form a link if @xmath17 is below some threshold .",
    "this procedure is repeated for each possible partner of the new node .",
    "thus , each new node can have initially up to @xmath18 links with the other existing nodes .",
    "existing nodes can have more than @xmath18 links as more nodes are added to the network and link up with the existing nodes .",
    "there are no multiple links between pairs of nodes .",
    "because each node is given a random trait vector , and the nodes to link to are also chosen randomly , many properties of the network simply depend on the probability @xmath19 , that two chosen nodes will link together :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the probability of the distance @xmath17 between two nodes , and the sum is over all possible distance values .",
    "thus , the model is reduced to the following procedure . at each time step",
    "we add a node to the network , and attempt to link with @xmath18 existing nodes which are chosen at random .",
    "an actual connection is made with a probability @xmath19 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the network in the limit of large time @xmath22 , does not depend on the initial condition of starting with a single isolated vertex .",
    "although frequently structural properties of a network of nodes with trait vectors depends only on @xmath19 , there are other properties which will depend on the detailed form of @xmath16 and the nature of the trait vectors",
    ". examples of such properties include the distribution of traits in different parts of the network and the correlation of traits with distance in the network .",
    "for example , one can imagine a very simple network of nodes representing men and women . in one network",
    "the probability of forming a link is independent of sex , and in the other persons prefer to link up with members of the opposite sex . as long as the mean probability of two chosen nodes linking together is the same in the two scenarios",
    "the structural properties of the two networks will be the same , but the distribution of men and women within the network will be quite different in the two cases . in this paper",
    "we confine ourselves to the structural properties of networks and are considering these other non - structural properties in our current research .",
    "the expected number of edges at a node is approximately @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the time - step when it was created , ( the smaller @xmath25 is , the older the node is ) @xmath22 is the total simulation time , @xmath1 is the probability that two nodes form a connection , @xmath26 is the maximum number of initial connections of a newly created node , and @xmath27 is the @xmath28 harmonic number given by the formula @xmath29 for @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "this equation shows that the number of edges of a node heavily depends on the age of the node .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : kn ] ) slightly overestimates the number of connections for the oldest nodes in the network in two respects .",
    "first , the above formula assumes that a node always has @xmath2 possible initial connections .",
    "however , multiple connections between a pair of nodes are not allowed , and there are less than @xmath2 available partners for the initial connections of a node created before or in the @xmath32 time step ( overestimation of initial connections ) .",
    "second , the term for the late connections assumes that a node has a @xmath33 chance of being selected as the partner of the @xmath34 node ( which chooses @xmath2 possible partners out of @xmath35 already existing nodes ) .",
    "however , for a node created in time step @xmath36 , this term yields a probability of being chosen greater than @xmath37 between time steps @xmath38 and @xmath2 ( where @xmath39 ) that is unacceptable again because multiple connections between a pair of nodes are not allowed ( overestimation of late connections ) . below is the formula correcting these errors , but will use the simpler , uncorrected formula in the remaining part of our paper because the errors are negligible .    @xmath40   & \\textrm{if } n\\leq k+1\\\\ \\delta k\\left ( \\alpha _ { t}-\\ln \\left ( n-1\\right ) -\\frac{1}{2\\left ( n-1\\right ) } \\right )   & \\textrm{if } n > k+1\\ , , \\end{array}\\right .   \\end{array}\\ ] ]    using @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the euler - mascheroni constant @xcite , and @xmath43 .",
    "note that the first @xmath10 nodes are expected to have the same number of connections ( because @xmath44 does not depend on @xmath45 in their case ) , and the edge number starts breaking down exponentially for nodes created after time step @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kn_ca ] and [ fig : kn_si]_a _ ) .",
    "this means that this growth mechanism is identical to that where the first @xmath46 nodes are created in the same time step .",
    "we now wish to determine the edge distribution , @xmath47 , equal to the probability that a node picked at random has on average @xmath48 edges .",
    "we return to eq .",
    "( [ eq : kn ] ) ignoring the correction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kn_c ] ) , and write the formula for @xmath49 in the simpler form ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kn_ca ] and [ fig : kn_si]_a _ ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the same used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kn_c ] ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : kn_a ] ) , neglecting the term @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kn_a ] ) for @xmath25 large enough , and knowing that the age distribution of nodes is uniform , we analytically approximate the edge distribution of the network with the following exponential @xmath53 we used the standard transformation rule for random variables , @xmath54 with @xmath55 . for sufficiently large @xmath22 , due to the definition of @xmath51 , this can be effectively approximated by a distribution which is independent of @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kn_ca ] and [ fig : kn_si]_b _ ) : @xmath56    we can also determine a slightly different degree or edge distribution which is the percentage of nodes with @xmath57 edges .",
    "denote by @xmath58 the expected number of nodes with degree @xmath59 at time @xmath22 .",
    "the number of isolated nodes , @xmath60 , will increase by @xmath61 , which is the probability of the addition node not connecting to any existing node , and decrease on average by @xmath62 : @xmath63 the formula for the expected number of nodes of degree @xmath64 is a bit complicated . for ( @xmath65 )",
    "there are two ways to increase @xmath66 : either selecting degree @xmath35 nodes for connection with the new node or the new node having exactly @xmath59 edges . for ( @xmath67 )",
    ", the new node can not contribute to @xmath68 .",
    "the decrease will be proportional to the probability of choosing a degree @xmath59 node for attachment .",
    "these equations are correct as @xmath70 , and numerical simulations show that @xmath71 . substituting this form into the equations for @xmath72 we obtain    @xmath73    this degree distribution @xmath74 decays exponentially consistent with our previous result for @xmath47 .",
    "in some network models , such as the preferential attachment models , all the nodes belong to a single cluster . for such models",
    "the focus is on the degree distribution and the distance between nodes in the network .",
    "however , our network can contain a number of disconnected clusters of nodes .",
    "then the key questions become what is the cluster size distribution and is there a phase transition between a collection of finite size clusters and the appearance of a giant cluster much larger than the rest .",
    "the transition is similar to that in percolation , with our parameter @xmath19 playing the role of the site occupation probability in a percolation model . the key difference between our model and percolation models is that our nodes do not sit on a lattice structure , and there is thus no geometric constraints .",
    "the definition of a giant cluster in our model is somewhat different than a spanning cluster in percolation models .",
    "nevertheless , some of the behavior is similar .",
    "our model is similar to one by calloway _",
    "et al_. @xcite where an infinite order phase transition was found . in that model after a node was added to the network , two nodes were picked at random and connected with probability @xmath19 .",
    "our model is more general in that we consider the effect of making more than one link at any given time .",
    "also , in our model the new links are between the added node and exisiting nodes , whereas in the model by calloway _ et al _ the new links are between any two nodes in the network .    to determine the cluster distribution we use a procedure similar to the one we used to calculate the degree distribution . the cluster number @xmath75 denotes the expected number of clusters of size @xmath76 . on average , at each time step , @xmath61 isolated nodes arrive at the network and @xmath77 nodes will be chosen for attachment reducing @xmath78 .",
    "thus , @xmath79 is described by @xmath80 for @xmath81 new clusters of size @xmath76 come from connecting the new node to a cluster of size @xmath82 or if @xmath83 using the new node to make connections between smaller clusters whose sizes add up to @xmath76 . reducing @xmath84 will be @xmath85 nodes from clusters of size @xmath76 connecting to the new node .",
    "thus , we have @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89    @xmath90    the first sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cd3 ] ) determines the number of sums in the next term .",
    "each of these sums represent a cluster that is melted into the @xmath76 sized cluster .",
    "these equations are valid for @xmath91 , where the probability of closed loops tends to zero .",
    "the giant cluster , if there exists one , is an exception in which connection of nodes in loops is not negligible .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : cd3 ] ) holds only for the finite sized clusters in the network .",
    "this property lets us determine a generating function which we can use to find the size of the giant cluster .",
    "our simulations show that solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cd ] ) , ( [ eq : cd2 ] ) and ( [ eq : cd3 ] ) are of the steady state form @xmath92 . using this form in eqs .",

    "substituting @xmath3 into the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cd4 ] ) , ( [ eq : cd5 ] ) and ( [ eq : cd6 ] ) we obtain after some algebra the general result @xmath97 which can be written in the form : @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the gamma - function .",
    "( [ eq : cd2k1 ] ) shows that the cluster size distribution for @xmath3 always follows a power - law distribution . this result",
    "is confirmed by simulations shown in the left graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : clx ] .",
    "distributions of cluster sizes for @xmath100 ( right graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : clx ] ) , in contrast to @xmath3 show power - law behavior only near the phase transition .      fig .",
    "[ fig : s1 ] shows the simulation results for @xmath101 , the ratio of the average size of the largest cluster to the total number of nodes versus the connection probability @xmath1 .",
    "the figure suggests that there is a smooth transition in the appearance of @xmath101 at a specific value of @xmath19 between @xmath102 and @xmath103 which depends on the parameter @xmath104 to predict the position of a possible phase transition @xmath105 @xcite , we will use a generating function for the cluster size distribution @xcite . to derive the generating function we use the iterative eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cd4 ] ) , ( [ eq : cd5 ] ) , and ( [ eq : cd6 ] )",
    ". the generating function will be of the form : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the probability that a randomly chosen node is from a cluster of size @xmath108 . multiplying both size of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cd4 ] ) , ( [ eq : cd5 ] ) and ( [ eq : cd6 ] ) by @xmath109 , and summing over @xmath110 we derive a differential equation for @xmath111 @xmath112 rearranging for @xmath113 we obtain @xmath114 which can be further simplified to @xmath115    the generating function for the finite size clusters is exactly one at @xmath116 when there is no giant cluster in the network and @xmath117 otherwise .",
    "hence @xmath118 without an analytic solution for eqs .  (",
    "[ eq : gf5 ] ) , we calculate @xmath119 numerically by integrating eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gf5 ] ) with the initial condition @xmath120 where @xmath121 is small .",

    "[ fig : s1 ] there are results from direct simulations of the model ( symbols ) and solid lines from the integration of the generating function .",
    "the agreement is good which verifies the approximations .    to discuss the phase transition location we first consider the cases @xmath122 .",
    "consider the expected value that a randomly chosen node belongs to a finite size cluster .",
    "we can determine this quantity in terms of the generating function @xmath111 @xmath123 for those values of @xmath1 where no giant cluster exists , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and both the numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf5 ] ) goes to zero as @xmath126 . using lhopital s rule we derive a quadratic equation for @xmath127 .",
    "the solution of this equation is @xmath128 for @xmath129 . because as @xmath130 all clusters will have size 1",
    ", one can show that the correct solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pt2 ] ) is the one with the negative sign .",
    "in addition from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pt2 ] ) we can find the location of the phase transition .",
    "it is the value of @xmath1 where the solution of eq.[eq : pt2 ] becomes complex : @xmath131 in the region where there is a giant cluster @xmath132 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf5 ] ) becomes as @xmath133 @xmath134 which is still not solvable analytically .",
    "making the approximation @xmath135 when @xmath136 , we can simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq : pt4 ] ) close to @xmath105 : @xmath137 where @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : g1 ] we show the simulation results and the above derived theoretical functions for @xmath141 .",
    "we can see that for @xmath142 , where we have an explicit expression for @xmath141 in terms of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 the fit is very good .",
    "for @xmath139 the fit is good close to the phase transition point , where the approximation @xmath143 holds .",
    "although below @xmath144 the description of @xmath141 is very good , it seems that the location of the phase transition and the value of the function @xmath141 above @xmath105 is somewhat different than the data . also if we carefully check fig .",
    "[ fig : g1 ] at the jumps , we find that the larger the jump the less accurate the theory seems to be . this can be explained as follows . at the critical point the average size of finite clusters jumps ,",
    "hence much larger clusters appear in the network . as we can only simulate for a finite time large ( but not the giant ) clusters are underrepresented .",
    "the weights of them computed from the simulation data are less then they would be in an infinitely long simulation .",
    "away from the transition regime fewer finite size clusters remain beside the giant cluster in the network , and thus the distribution can be specified better .",
    "although the formalism using the generating function can be done for @xmath3 , the meaning of a giant cluster is problematic . in section [ sec : cluster ]",
    "we showed that the size - distribution of clusters for @xmath3 always follows a power - law which means there is no obvious border between the ` giant ' cluster and smaller clusters .",
    "there is not a sharp break between the largest and the next largest cluster .",
    "the physical reason for this is that clusters grow only by the addition of newly added nodes .",
    "this is different than the case for @xmath145 and in percolation models where clusters can also grow by a link combining two clusters . in this sense",
    "no giant cluster appears in the network except for @xmath146 .",
    "( [ eq : gf5 ] ) becomes @xmath147 which becomes @xmath148 in the limit @xmath149 with @xmath129 .",
    "applying lhopital s rule yields @xmath150 at @xmath151 , @xmath152@xmath153 , which means the average size of finite clusters approaches infinity . from the definition of @xmath111 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf1 ] ) and the power - law cluster size distribution for @xmath96 , it follows that @xmath129 for any @xmath154 . to see that @xmath155@xmath156 as @xmath149 for @xmath157",

( [ eq : cd2k1 ] ) , and @xmath159 , which can not be summed for @xmath160    when @xmath161 the probability of a new node not joining a cluster is higher then joining , and thus the weight of small clusters is higher than that of larger clusters , and hence the average size remains finite . as @xmath162 ,",
    "the probability of forming clusters increases and so do the weight of large clusters .      to show the nature of our phase transitions @xcite , we numerically integrated eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf5 ] ) for different values of @xmath2 near the corresponding critical @xmath105 . in fig.[fig : loglogs ] the linear parts of the log(-log(s ) ) plots suggest that @xmath163 and because all derivatives of @xmath101 vanish at @xmath105 , the transition is of infinite order .",

    "the present model was intended to gain insight into the evolution of various social networks by considering mechanisms that account for heterogeneity in the population of participating entities . to analyse the statistical properties of the generated network we simplified the model .",
    "we found that the structure of the network dramatically changes when the number of possible links to a newly added node increases from @xmath3 to @xmath100 . with @xmath3",
    "the network does not form a giant cluster but the average cluster size goes to infinity ( at @xmath168 ) in contrast to @xmath169 , where the giant cluster appears in an infinite - order phase transition and the average cluster size jumps discontinuously but remains finite .",

    "the distribution of the size of finite clusters always follows an exponential distribution , both below and above the critical point for @xmath83 , while the model studied in @xcite is in a critial state below and at the critical point and exhibits an exponential distribution of cluster size above the transition as in a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless phase transition .",

    "also , in our model multiple connections might be formed in one time step depending on parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this difference is well reflected in the generating function derived for the two models .",
    "the structural properties of our model are more relevant to many social networks than other growth models such as preferential attachment because the degree distribution is exponential which is closer to real social systems and because there are clusters of nodes which represents the reality of social systems where people usually form various communities which are relatively isolated from each other . as long as the distribution of nodal traits are random , then",
    "the structural properties which we have discussed in this paper do not depend on the nature of the traits and thus our network model should be relevant to any social network .",
    "the next step is to analyze the distribution of traits on a social network .",
    "this will vary depending on how the attachment rule depends on the values of these traits even though the structural properties of the network remains the same .",
    "we will discuss the distribution of traits on a network in a future publication .",
    "we introduced a model of growing social networks and analyzed its statistical properties .",
    "our analytical calculations showed that these growing networks exhibit exponential degree distributions .",
    "we gave an explicit description of the expected number of edges which showed an exponential dependence on the age of a node .",
