    "these wavelengths agree with the dispersion relation found experimentally for frictional particles .",
    "the effect of fluctuations has been examined in simulations of the swift - hohenberg model .",
    "the results deduced for the mean field onset in md simulations agree well with the actual onset in continuum simulations for both @xmath15 and @xmath160 .",
    "we find the strength of the noise to be @xmath161 for stripes at @xmath15 , and @xmath162 for disordered squares at @xmath147 .",
    "the value determined in an experiment for a slightly shallower granular layer at @xmath163 was @xmath164 @xcite , which is within the range of noise values obtained in this investigation .",
    "the smallest noise strength found for our granular system is comparable to the largest noise strength found thus far in experiments in ordinary fluids , which obtained @xmath165 in measurements near the critical point , while values typical for convection are closer to @xmath166 @xcite . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the noise is strong enough to delay onset of long range patterns by @xmath167 in md simulation , and influences strongly the behavior of the system even more than 20% below this onset .",
    "thus noise plays an important role in granular media near the onset of patterns .",
    "this study indicates that hydrodynamic theory holds promise for investigating and understanding pattern formation in granular flows .",
    "however , quantitative comparisons between continuum theory and experiment will require the addition of noise terms into the equations .",
    "the addition of noise would be an important step towards using the powerful tools of hydrodynamic theory to investigate problems of pattern formation in granular materials .",
    "the absence of friction in these simulations restricts our investigation to stripe patterns .",
    "simulations without friction have not yielded the square and hexagonal patterns seen in experiments with frictional particles @xcite .",
    "further research into pattern formation using continuum simulations should investigate the most effective way to incorporate friction between particles into the continuum simulations and should examine how the strength of friction in the simulation affects pattern formation in the system .",

    "<S> the delay in the onset of order in molecular dynamics simulations and the amplitude of noise below this onset are consistent with the presence of fluctuations which are absent in the continuum theory . </S>",
