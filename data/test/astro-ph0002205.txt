    "there are two main properties which make the study of the galactic globular clusters ( ggc ) particularly interesting : 1 ) each cluster ( with possible rare exceptions ) is made up by a single population of stars , all born at the same time , in the same place , and out of the same material ; 2 ) ggc stars have the oldest measurable age in the universe , and therefore we believe they are the oldest fossil records of the formation history of our galaxy .    among the many tools we have to investigate the properties of a stellar population , the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) are the most powerful ones , as they allow to recover for each individual star its evolutionary phase , giving precious information on the age of the entire stellar system , its chemical content , and its distance .",
    "this information allows us to locate the system in the space , giving a base for the distance scale , study the formation histories of the galaxy , and test our knowledge of stellar evolution models .    in particular",
    ", the study of a large sample of simple stellar systems , as the ggcs , provides important clues to the milky way formation history .",
    "recently , many studies on the relative ages of the ggcs have been presented with results at least controversial : while some authors find a notable age spread ( @xmath9 gyrs ) among the clusters , others find that the bulk of ggcs is coeval .",
    "this controversy is surely mainly due to the heterogeneity of the data used in each study , where the combination of photographic and/or ccd data from the early epochs of solid state detectors has been frequently used .",
    "for this reason , a survey of both southern and northern ggcs has been started two years ago by means of 1-m class telescopes , i.e. the 91 cm european southern observatory ( eso ) / dutch telescope and the 1 m isaac newton group ( ing ) / jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) .",
    "we were able to collect the data for 52 of the 69 known ggcs with @xmath10 .",
    "thirty - nine have been observed with the dutch telescope ( data that are presented in this paper , hereafter paper i ) , and the remaining ones with the jkt ( the corresponding cmds will be presented in a companion paper , rosenberg et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper ii ) .    as a first exploitation of this new data base ,",
    "we have conducted a ggc relative age investigation based on the best 34 cmds of our catalog ( rosenberg et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper iii ) , showing that most of the ggcs have the same age .",
    "we have also used our data base to obtain a photometric metallicity ranking scale ( saviane et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper iv ) , based on the red giant branch ( rgb ) morphology .",
    "we measured a complete set of metallicity indices , based on the morphology and position of the rgb . using a grid of selected rgb fiducial points",
    ", we defined a function in the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , [ fe / h ] space which is able to reproduce the whole set of ggc rgbs in terms of a single parameter ( the metallicity ) .",
    "the use of this function will improve the current determinations of metallicity and distances within the local group .",
    "there are many other parameters that can be measured from a homogeneous , well calibrated cmd data base : the horizontal branch ( hb ) level , homogeneous reddening and distances , etc .",
    "we are presently working on these problems .",
    "however , we believe it is now the time to present to the community this data base to give to anyone interested the opportunity to take advantage of it .    in the next section , we will describe the observations collected at the eso / dutch telescope during two runs in 1997 .",
    "the data reduction and calibration is presented in sect .",
    "[ dat ] , while in sect .",
    "[ comparison ] a cross check of the calibration between the two runs is given . in order to facilitate the reader s work",

    "the absolute calibration of the observations to the v - johnson and i - cousins systems is based on a set of standard stars from the catalog of landolt ( @xcite ) . specifically , the observed standard stars were in the fields : pg0231 , sa95 ( 41 , 43 , 96 , 97 , 98 , 100 , 101 , 102 , 112 , 115 ) , sa98 ( 556 , 557 , 563 , 580 , 581 , l1 , 614 , 618 , 626 , 627 , 634 , 642 ) , rubin 149 , rubin 152 , pg0918 , pg0942 , pg1047 , pg1323 , pg1525 , pg1530 , pg1633 , and mark a. at least 3 exposures were taken for each standard field , with a total of @xmath26 standard star measurements per night and per filter .",
