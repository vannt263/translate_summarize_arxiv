    "despite their overall similarity , the optical light curves of classical novae show a wide variety of timescales and shapes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "various empirical time - scaling laws have been proposed in the attempt to recognize common patterns and to unify the nova light curves .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed a compression of the time scale obtained by normalizing the time to @xmath7 , the time for the brightness to decrease by @xmath8 magnitudes ( usually @xmath9 or 3 ) .",
    "the results were however unsatisfactory because slow novae reached their late stages relatively earlier than faster novae .",
    "a different approach was adopted by @xcite who , based on a large collection of nova light curves , found that @xmath10 , the visual magnitude at time @xmath11 , is conveniently represented , on average , by @xmath12 at early stages and @xmath13 at later stages with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the underlying problem of both the above approaches is that , during the decline phase from maximum , the flux in the visual band , initially dominated by free  free emission , becomes more and more affected by the increasing contribution from the emission lines , which finally dominates .",
    "the presence of these two competing and heterogeneous emission mechanisms is most likely the main cause for the difficulty to find a suitable normalization parameter for the nova light curves .",
    "a more appropriate way to monitor the evolution of the visual continuum is to use the strmgren @xmath16 filter , which is designed to avoid strong emission lines and , in particular , the [ ] line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of v1668 cyg",
    ", @xcite has indeed shown that the continuum @xmath16 flux declines much faster than the h@xmath17 [ ] fluxes .",
    "consequently , the decline rate is much faster in the @xmath16 band than in the visual band .",
    "this was demonstrated by @xcite , who showed that the @xmath16 magnitude of v1668 cyg declines with a slope of @xmath18 at early stages and",
    "it then changes to @xmath19 at later stages , values that are sensibly larger than those reported by @xcite .",
    "the observations of v1500 cyg by @xcite suggest that the visual and infrared continua are well represented by free - free emission during the early decay phase .",
    "the same applies to gq mus : @xcite reported that , during the early 40 days ( diffuse enhanced and orion - phases ) , the energy spectrum of @xmath20 was well represented by optically thin free - free emission ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the flux in the optical and infrared appears to decay with time as @xmath21 in various speed classes of novae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for v1500 cyg ) .",
    "an interesting attempt to unify the light curves of novae was proposed by @xcite , who suggested that the main parameter determining the shape of the light curve is the radius of the ejected shell , @xmath22 , where @xmath11 is the time from optical maximum , and @xmath23 is the velocity of the ejecta .",
    "he plotted various nova light curves in the @xmath24 diagram and found that light curves overlapped each other .",
    "the rather large scatter of the data in that diagram is probably due to the fact that the expansion velocity of novae varies with time ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite studied the time evolution of the uv continuum flux in twelve co and onemg novae and found a strong correlation between the @xmath25 time and the time of maximum flux in the 1455   continuum ( see fig . 4 in their paper ) .",
    "in a subsequent paper , @xcite studied the time evolution of the uv emission lines in seven co novae and found a strong correlation between the line ionization potential and the time of maximum emission normalized to the @xmath25 ( fig . 5 in their paper ) .",
    "these results strongly suggest that novae do indeed evolve following a common pattern being time - normalized by the @xmath25 time , which mainly depends on the white dwarf mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter referred as paper i ) found that the visual and ir light curves of several novae follow a universal decline law , and interpreted that in terms of free - free emission ( paper i ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter referred as paper ii ) ; in particular , the time - normalized light curves were found to be independent of the white dwarf mass , the chemical composition of ejecta , and wavelength .",
    "they also showed that the uv 1455    light curve , interpreted as blackbody continuum , can also be time - normalized by the same factor as in the optical and ir .",
    "the authors , in the above quoted papers , determined the white dwarf mass and other parameters for a number of relatively well - observed classical novae .    in the present paper ,",
    "we apply the above universal decline law to the classical nova gq muscae 1983 .",
    "gq mus is the first classical nova in which the supersoft x - ray turnoff was detected with the x - ray satellite _ rosat _ @xcite .",
    "this object was also well observed by the uv satellite _ iue _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in near - ir bands of _ jhkl _",

    "the next section summarizes the basic observational characteristics of gq mus . in  3 , we revisit the uv light curves of gq mus obtained with the _ iue _ satellite . in  4 ,",
    "we briefly introduce our method based on our optically thick wind model .",
    "light curve fittings of gq mus in the x - ray , uv , optical , and near ir bands are shown in  5 .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in   6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "finally , in the appendix , we assess the problem of the contribution of the emission lines to the visual and infrared photometric bands for gq mus and for other well known novae : v1500 cyg , v1668 cyg , and v1974 cyg .",
    "gq mus was discovered by liller on 1983 january 18.14 ut ( jd 2,445,352.64 ) at @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported two pre - discovery magnitudes , i.e. , @xmath27 obtained by gainsford on 1983 january 15.597 ut ( 2,445,350.097 ) and @xmath28 obtained by pattie on 1983 january 15.628 ut ( 2,445,350.128 ) .",

    "early optical _ ubvri _ and near infrared _ jhkl _ observations of gq mus show a fast evolution with @xmath31 days and @xmath32 days @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed gq mus over a wide wavelength range from 0.12  10 @xmath33 during the early 40 days ( diffuse enhanced and orion - phases ) .",
    "these authors reported an extraordinary large amplitude brightening by @xmath34 mag , with respect to the prenova magnitude of @xmath35 .",
    "after about 4 months of slow decline , the brightness stabilized in the range @xmath36 for about 400 days .",
    "after that , the nova gradually declined to @xmath37 for another 400 days ( see figures below ) .    in this paper",
    "we will use the optical and ir photometric data from @xcite and @xcite , which cover about 300 days after discovery .",
    "no other systematic photometric observations are available at later stages except for the visual magnitude measurements ( @xmath38 ) obtained with the fine error sensor ( fes ) monitor on board _ iue _ , which cover 500 days after discovery , and the visual photometric data collected by rasnz ( royal astronomical society of new zealand ) and by aavso ( american association of variable star observers ) , which cover 1000 days after discovery .",
    "@xcite determined a photometric orbital period of 0.0594 days for gq mus , the shortest known for a classical nova . later on",
    ", @xcite revised the ephemeris of gq mus based on the 1989 and 1990 photometric observations , i.e. , @xmath39 we have adopted this ephemeris for our binary model .",
    "@xcite also suggested that gq mus is a polar system because of the presence of x - ray emission and high ( @xmath40)/h@xmath41 ratio .",
    "based on the optical observation from 1984 march to 1988 march ( 400  1800 days after the outburst ) , @xcite suggested that the observed progressive increase in the ionization level of the nova shell was due to a very hot radiation source with a temperature of @xmath42  k , increasing with time while the bolometric luminosity remained constant .",
    "@xcite studied the soft x - ray _ exosat _ light curve from optical maximum to about 900 days after it , and suggested a model of a very hot white dwarf remnant with a maximum temperature of @xmath43  k evolving at constant bolometric luminosity .",
    "_ rosat _ observations clearly show that the supersoft x - ray flux decayed about 10 yr after the outburst @xcite .",
    "this information is very important because , compared with our model predictions , it allows one to determine the white dwarf mass quite accurately ( see , e.g. , paper i ) .",
    "one of the most puzzling features of gq mus is its long lasting brightness in the uv range , which made possible its regular monitoring by _ iue _ over as much as 11.5 yr . because of satellite constraints , the _ iue _ observations could not start before jd 2,445,385.07 , i.e. , 32.4 days after discovery . the early _ iue _ observations of gq mus are discussed in detail by @xcite . in the following",
    "we revisit the problem of the color excess @xmath44 of gq mus and describe the long term evolution of the ultraviolet continuum and of the emission lines , as well as the secondary outburst which took place about 151 days after the main one .",
    "the ultraviolet spectra were retrieved from the _ iue _ archive through the ines ( _ iue _ newly extracted spectra ) system , which also provides details of the observations . the use of _ iue _ ines data is particularly important for the determination of the reddening correction because of the implementation of upgraded spectral extraction and flux calibration procedures compared to previously published uv spectra .",
    "the color excess of gq mus has been determined from the hydrogen balmer lines by @xcite and @xcite , who found @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . about the same range of values has been reported by @xcite and @xcite , who found @xmath47 and 0.50 , respectively , based on the strength of the dust absorption band around 2175   in the early _ iue _ spectra . given the criticality of the reddening correction , we have attempted to improve its accuracy by using two independent methods based on the shape of the uv continuum and on the emission line intensities .",
    "the galactic extinction curve @xcite shows a pronounced broad maximum around 2175    due to dust absorption , but it takes the same value @xmath48 at @xmath49 , 1878 , and 2386  , so that the slope of the straight line passing through the continuum points at these wavelengths is insensitive to @xmath44 in a @xmath50 plot .",
    "this circumstance can be used to get a reliable estimate of @xmath44 as that in which the stellar continuum becomes closely linear in the 15122386   region , and passes through the continuum points at the above wavelengths . from 8 pairs of short and long wavelength _ iue _",
    "spectra taken during the nebular phase we have in this way found @xmath51 .",
    "a different way to estimate the @xmath44 color excess consists in using the observed relative intensities of the 1640   balmer line , and the 2734 and 3203   paschen recombination lines , and compare these with theoretical ratios @xcite .",
    "the intensity ratios @xmath52 and @xmath53 were measured in 8 pairs of short and long wavelength _ iue _",
    "low resolution spectra obtained during the nebular phase . from a comparison with the theoretical values for an electron temperature and density of ( @xmath54 , @xmath55)=(20,000 k , 10@xmath56 @xmath57 ) we have obtained 22 independent determinations of the color excess leading to a mean value of @xmath58 . in the following we will adopt the error  weighted mean of the two above determinations , i.e. @xmath5 . examples of _ iue _ spectra of gq mus corrected with @xmath59 are reported in figure [ ebvplot ] for the following days ( after the outburst ) : 108 , 151 ( secondary outburst ; see later ) , 202 and 538 .",
    "we have measured the mean flux in two narrow bands 20   wide centered at 1455   and 2855  , selected to best represent the uv continuum because little affected by emission lines ( cassatella et al .",
    "figure [ plotcont ] shows the time evolution of the @xmath60   ) and @xmath61  ) fluxes and of the uv color index @xmath62  )@xmath63   ) ] .",
    "the measurements were made on well exposed low resolution large aperture spectra .",
    "unfortunately , the _ iue _ spectrum of day 37 ( swp19299 ) , very important because it was the first obtained , was heavily saturated around 1455  . to make a crude estimate of the corresponding flux we have determined the scaling factor between this and the next spectrum obtained on day 49 ( swp 19383 ) , in a region where both were well exposed ( 1520 - 1620 ) , and assumed that the spectral slope remained the same in the two spectra .",
    "the value so obtained , reported as an open circle in figure [ plotcont ] , likely represents an upper limit to the true value because , as shown in the same figure , the uv color was comparatively cooler in the first observations .",
    "figure [ plotcont ] reports also , for comparison , the visual light curve obtained from the fine error sensor ( fes ) counts on board _ iue _ , once corrected for fes time dependent sensitivity degradation ( see cassatella et al .",
    "2004 for details on the fes calibration ) .",
    "it appears from figure [ plotcont ] that the gradual fading of the uv and visual fluxes was interrupted , around jd 2,445,499 ( day 151 ) , by a secondary outburst , as also noticed by @xcite .",
    "the secondary outburst had actually the appearance of a `` uv flash '' because of its especially large amplitude at short wavelengths .",
    "indeed , compared with the _ iue _ low resolution observations obtained just before and after this event ( days 108 and 202 ) , the uv flux increased by a factor of 9 at 1455   and by a factor 2.2 at 2885  , while the visual flux increased only by a factor of 1.5 . the consequent hardening of the uv continuum is also reflected by the upturn of the @xmath64 color index , as shown in the same figure .",
    "llllll solar composition & 0.7068 & 0.0140 & 0.0018 & 0.0034 & @xcite + gq mus 1983 & 0.37 & 0.24 & 0.0023 & 0.0039 & @xcite + gq mus 1983 & 0.27 & 0.40 & 0.0034 & 0.023 & @xcite + gq mus 1983 & 0.43 & 0.19 & & & @xcite      also the uv emission lines suffered from important changes in coincidence with the secondary outburst of day 151 , as shown in figure [ plotlines ] , which reports , as a function of time , the flux in the most prominent permitted uv emission lines , as measured by us from the available _ iue _ low resolution spectra .",
    "the figure shows that , on day 151 , the flux of the high ionization emission lines ( 1640  , 1240 and 1550  ) had decreased substantially while , on the contrary , it increased in the low ionization resonance lines of and , so implying a drastic change of the ionization structure of the emitting regions .",
    "the other important feature of the secondary outburst was the appearance of a strong p cygni profile in the doublet @xmath65 1393.74 , 1402.77  , shown in figure [ pcygni ] .",
    "the figure reports also , for comparison , the profile of the neon nova v1974 cyg obtained 45 days after the outburst .",
    "a comparison of observed with theoretical p cygni profiles computed with the sei method @xcite indicate that the terminal velocity of the wind was about the same for the two novae ( @xmath66 3200 km  s@xmath67 ) .",
    "the special interest of the observations in figure [ pcygni ] is that gq mus had entered the nebular phase well before day 151 , so that the presence of p cygni profiles was not expected to be detectable at this stage .",
    "indeed , p cygni profiles were not detectable in an earlier _ iue _ high resolution spectrum of day 49 , despite the factor of two longer exposure time , nor they were at later stages .",
    "this strongly suggests that a short duration mass ejection episode took place around day 151 .",
    "this episode caused efficient recombination to take place in the emitting region , observed as a substantial , although transitory , fainting of the high ionization emission lines ( cf . fig.[plotlines ] ) .",
    "the fast recovery of the emission line spectrum by day 202 suggests that the ejected mass must have been small .",
    "also the presence of a flare at uv wavelengths rather than in the optical ( cf . fig .",
    "[ plotcont ] ) requires a small opacity in the uv and then a small ejected mass .",
    "we present a unified model for the ir , optical , uv , and supersoft x - ray light curves of the 1983 outburst of gq mus . as in paper",
    "i , our models are based on the optically thick wind theory of nova outbursts described in @xcite .",
    "after a thermonuclear runaway sets in on a mass - accreting wd , its envelope expands greatly to @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the photospheric radius , and it then settles onto steady - state regime . the decay phase of the nova can be followed by a sequence of steady state solutions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "using the same method and numerical techniques as in @xcite , we have followed the nova evolution by connecting steady state solutions along the envelope mass - decreasing sequence .",
    "the equations of motion , radiative diffusion , and conservation of energy are solved from the bottom of the hydrogen - rich envelope through the photosphere under the condition that the solution goes through a critical point of a steady - state wind .",
    "the winds are accelerated deep inside the photosphere so that they are called `` optically thick winds . ''",
    "we have used updated opal opacities @xcite .",
    "one of the boundary conditions for our numerical code consists in assuming that photons are emitted at the photosphere as a blackbody with a photospheric temperature @xmath70 .",
    "x - ray and uv fluxes are estimated directly from the blackbody emission , but infrared and optical fluxes are calculated from free - free emission by using physical values of our wind solutions as mentioned below in  [ free - free_light_curve ] .",

    "optically thick winds stop after a large part of the envelope is blown in the winds .",
    "the envelope settles into hydrostatic equilibrium , while its mass decreases in time by nuclear burning",
    ". then we solve the equation of static balance instead of the equation of motion .",
    "when the nuclear burning decays , the wd enters a cooling phase , in which the luminosity is supplied with heat flow from the ash of hydrogen burning .      in the optically thick wind model ,",
    "a large part of the envelope is ejected continuously during a relatively long period ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "after maximum expansion , the photospheric radius gradually decreases keeping the total luminosity ( @xmath71 ) almost constant .",
    "the photospheric temperature ( @xmath70 ) increases with time because of @xmath72 .",
    "the maximum emission shifts from the optical to supersoft x - ray through ultraviolet ( uv ) and extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) .",
    "this causes the luminosity to decrease in the optical and to increase in the uv , until it reaches a maximum .",
    "the following decay in the uv is accompanied by an increase of the supersoft x - ray range .",
    "these timescales depend crucially on the wd parameters such as the wd mass and the chemical composition of the envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) .",
    "thus , we can follow the development of optical , uv , and supersoft x - ray light curves by a single modeled sequence of steady wind solutions",
    ".      spectra of novae show blackbody features at very early stages , but free - free emission from optically thin plasma will eventually dominate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . during the optically thick wind phase",
    "( see paper i for more details ) , the extended regions outside the photosphere are optically thin .",
    "the optical and ir free - free emission fluxes arising from these regions can be estimated from @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the flux at the frequency @xmath75 , @xmath55 and @xmath76 are the number densities of electrons and ions , respectively , @xmath77 is the volume of the optically thin region , @xmath69 is the photospheric radius , @xmath78 is the wind mass loss rate , and @xmath79 is the photospheric velocity . in equation ( [ free - free - wind ] ) we assume that the electron temperature and the degree of ionization are constant in the free - free emitting region . we also assume that @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and use the continuity equation , i.e. , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the density and velocity of the wind , respectively .",

    "the proportionality constants in equations ( [ free - free - wind ] ) and ( [ free - free - stop ] ) can not be determined a priori because radiative transfer is not calculated outside the photosphere : these were determined using the procedure described below in  [ light_curve_fitting ] .",
    "the light curves of our optically thick wind model are parameterized by the wd mass ( @xmath91 ) , the chemical composition of the envelope ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 ) , and the envelope mass ( @xmath96 ) at the time of the outburst ( jd 2,445,348.0 ) . for the metal abundance",

    "the large deviation from the model s smooth trend is clearly due to the occurrence of the uv flash discussed in  3.2 .",

    "first we point out two important epochs of the nova development : one is the end of optically thick wind phase on day 1000 , and the other is the end of hydrogen shell burning on day 3300 as summarized in table [ properties_gq_mus ] . because of the rapid shrinking of the the photospheric radius ( @xmath69 ) , also the photospheric temperature ( @xmath70 ) rapidly increases until the wind stops , as indicated in figure [ gq_mus_softxray_r_t ] .",
    "also the wind mass loss rate ( @xmath78 ) decreases rapidly from @xmath124  yr@xmath67 to @xmath125  yr@xmath67 during the first 1000 days .",
    "thus the total mass ejected by the winds amounts to @xmath126 . after the wind stops , the photospheric radius becomes smaller than @xmath127 , and the photospheric temperature eventually becomes larger than 20 ev , so that the nova enters a supersoft x - ray phase . after the hydrogen shell burning ends",

    "@xcite deduced a luminosity of @xmath128 ergs  s@xmath67 and a temperature of @xmath129  k. these values are consistent with our model of a @xmath130 wd , which provides @xmath131  k and @xmath132 ergs  s@xmath67 about 2700 days after the outburst , as it may be appreciated from figure [ gq_mus_softxray_r_t ] .",
    "@xcite estimated a central source temperature of 164,000  k , a luminosity of @xmath133 , and an ejecta mass of @xmath134 , about 4000 days after the outburst .",
    "for our best - fit model of a @xmath135 white dwarf with an initial envelope mass of @xmath136 , the total mass lost by the optically thick wind is @xmath137 .",

    "the above authors determined the duration of the wind phase and of the static hydrogen burning phase to be @xmath155 yr and @xmath156 yr , to be compared with our values of 2.7 yr and 6.3 yr , respectively .",
    "the much longer duration of the wind phase obtained by us is likely due to the rapid decrease of the wind mass loss rate with an e - folding time of 0.24 yr , corresponding to a decrease by a factor of 10 in 0.7 yr .",
    "figure [ uv_outburst ] shows the reddening corrected uv color index @xmath64 as a function of the photospheric temperature obtained from our best - fit model at the time of the individual observations ( filled circles ) .",
    "the figure indicates that the color index decreases smoothly with increasing temperature except for its abrupt decrease at the time of the uv flash on day 151 ( note that the temperature increases with time in these early phases ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the color@xmath70 values reported in figure [ uv_outburst ] with those derived from @xcite and @xcite , who calculated early - time nova spectra using non - lte atmosphere codes with winds having density and velocity laws within the nova envelope . for this comparison",

    "indeed , line blanketing is rather small at this wavelength , so that the blackbody model does not deviate much from hauschildt et al.s non - lte models , as already discussed in paper i.      the mass of the donor star ( the secondary component ) can be estimated from the orbital period . @xcite",

    "indeed , the emergence of the companion in v1500 cyg took place about 50 days after optical maximum ( paper i ) , which is consistent with the appearance of the line 57 days after maximum . in the case of gq mus , the absence of strong coronal lines on day 97 days is consistent with our model in which the companion emerged about 330 or 500 days after maximum .    in their study of gq mus",
    ", @xcite reported that the [ ] @xmath169 coronal line first appeared 2.2 to 3.4 yrs after the outburst , and became the strongest about 4 years after it .",
    "they argued that the coronal line was due to photoionization from a hot radiation source rather than to collisional excitation .",
    "in our @xmath135 white dwarf model , the optically thick wind stopped about 960 days ( 2.7 yrs ) after the outburst and then the photospheric temperature gradually increased to above @xmath170 ev 4 yrs after the outburst , as shown in figures [ gq_mus_softxray_r_t ] and [ gq_mus_uv1455_r_t ] .",
