    "the magnetic behavior of type - ii superconductors depends strongly on the sample shape @xcite .",
    "significant progress has recently been made in understanding the effects of a sample aspect ratio on its magnetic behavior@xcite , in particular , in the case of thin films with the magnetic field normal to the film plane ( `` perpendicular geometry '' ) @xcite .",
    "theory @xcite and experiment @xcite show that the magnetic behavior in the perpendicular geometry has many distinctive features , essentially different from the parallel geometry , e.g. a more complicated structure of the critical state and the presence of geometrical barriers @xcite .",
    "a number of elegant analytical solutions for the perpendicular geometry ( for strips and disks ) describe the meissner @xcite , the mixed state @xcite , and magnetic flux creep @xcite .",
    "these solutions are based on the important ansatz , that one can treat the film as an infinitesimal thin plane . then , current distribution related to vortex bending does not influence the results of the analysis which deals only with the current density and the vortex displacements averaged over the film thickness .",
    "this approach was very successful in explaining the peculiarities of the current density and the magnetic induction distribution across the film plane .",
    "however , this approach can not account for any _ thickness dependence _ of both persistent current density @xmath0 @xcite and magnetic relaxation rate @xcite in thin films .",
    "explanation of the observed decrease of @xmath0 with the increase of the film thickness @xmath2 is usually based on the idea that pinning on surfaces _ perpendicular _ to the direction of vortices is strong enough and must be taken into account @xcite . however , as we demonstrate below , this is not sufficient for understanding the thickness dependence of the magnetic relaxation rate , which was found to decrease with the increase of the film thickness @xcite .",
    "another explanation of the observed thickness dependence of the current density may be based on collective pinning in a 2d regime , i. e. , for longitudinal correlation length @xmath3  larger than the film thickness .",
    "this case is carefully considered in @xcite . in a 2d collective pinning regime ,",
    "the pinning is stronger for thinner samples . as a result ,",
    "in this model both the critical - current density and the creep barrier are larger in thinner samples , contrary to the experimental results .",
    "also , this scenario is probably not relevant for the explanation of the experimental data discussed below , because the thickness of our films @xmath4  is larger than @xmath5 .    in order to understand the experimental results we calculate the current density and magnetic induction distribution by using the two - mode electrodynamics theory suggested earlier to explain the ac response in bulk materials @xcite .",
    "the essence of this theory is that two length scales govern the penetration of fields and currents into type - ii superconductors .",
    "the longer scale is of electrodynamic origin and , therefore , is more universal : it exists , for example , in a superconductor in the meissner state ( the london penetration depth ) or , in a normal conductor ( the skin depth ) .",
    "the shorter scale is related to the vortex - line tension , so it is unique for a type - ii superconductor in the mixed state .",
    "this scale was introduced into the continuous theory of type - ii superconductors by matheiu and simon @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . when applying the two - mode electrodynamics to the critical state one",
    "may ignore the time variation , i.e. , the two - mode electrodynamics becomes the _ two - mode electrostatics _ theory .",
    "our analysis of a type - ii thin superconducting film within the two - mode electrostatics theory leads to the conclusion that for strong enough bulk pinning , inhomogeneity of the current density becomes important , even in the absence of surface pinning , if the film thickness exceeds the campbell penetration depth @xmath6 .",
    "thus , inhomogeneity of the current distribution throughout the film thickness is a _ distinctive _ and inevitable feature of the perpendicular film geometry like , for example , the geometrical barrier @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneity of the current distribution is significantly enhanced if the critical state is supported by the surface pinning . in this case ,",
    "most of the current is confined to a layer of a depth of the order of the intervortex distance , which is usually much smaller than the london penetration depth @xmath7 and film thickness . as a result of this inhomogeneity ,",
    "the _ measured _ average critical current density becomes thickness dependent .",
    "this current inhomogeneity also causes a thickness dependence of the magnetic relaxation rate . in the following",
    "we present detailed calculations of the distribution of the current density @xmath0 and induction field @xmath8 in thin type - ii superconducting film , resulting from surface and/or bulk pinning .",
    "we then introduce the first critical state model which takes into account the variation in @xmath0 throughout the film thickness .",
    "calculations based on this critical state model lead to a thickness dependence in @xmath0 and magnetic relaxation rate .",
    "these predictions are compared with the experimental data .",
    "let us consider a thin superconducting strip , infinitely long in the @xmath9 -direction , with width @xmath10 @xmath11 and thickness @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "external magnetic field @xmath14 is applied along the @xmath15 -axis , perpendicular to the film plane .",
    "the vortex density @xmath16 is determined by the @xmath15-component @xmath17 of the average magnetic field ( magnetic induction ) @xmath18 in the film : @xmath19 .",
    "supercurrent of density @xmath20 flows along the @xmath9-axis resulting in a lorenz force in the @xmath21-direction , and a vortex displacement @xmath22 along the @xmath21-axis .",
    "we begin with the electrodynamic equations describing the mixed state of type - ii superconductors in such a geometry .",
    "they include the london equation for the @xmath21-component of the magnetic field : @xmath23 the maxwell equation : @xmath24 and the equation of vortex motion : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a field of order of the first critical field @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the inter - vortex distance , and @xmath29 is an effective vortex core radius .",
    "the equation of the vortex motion arises from the balance among four terms : ( i ) the friction force proportional to the friction coefficient @xmath30 ; ( ii ) the homogeneous , linear elastic pinning force @xmath31 ( i. e. assuming small displacements @xmath22 ) ; ( iii ) the lorentz force proportional to the current density @xmath0 ; and ( iv ) the vortex - line tension force ( the last term on the right - hand side of eq .",

    "@xcite .    in the parallel geometry , ( @xmath32 )",
    ", vortices move without bending so that the @xmath21-component @xmath33 is absent , and the maxwell equation becomes : @xmath34 . since @xmath35 is proportional to the vortex density , this current may be called a _ diffusion current_. the case of the perpendicular geometry , ( @xmath36 ) , is essentially different : the diffusion current is small compared to the _ bending current _",
    "@xmath37 ( see the estimation below ) and may be neglected for calculation of the distribution throughout the film thickness ( along the @xmath15-axis ) . as a result ,",
    "( [ vor ] ) becomes @xmath38 equations ( [ lon ] ) and ( [ vor - tr ] ) determine the distribution of the displacement @xmath39 and of the in - plane magnetic induction @xmath40 .",
    "this also yields a distribution of the current density @xmath41 . but",
    "these equations are still not closed , since the two components of the magnetic induction , @xmath33 and @xmath42 , and current density @xmath43 are connected by the biot - savart law . however , neglecting the diffusion current in the maxwell equation we separate the problem into two parts : ( 1 ) determination of the distribution of fields and currents along the @xmath15- axis , taking the total current @xmath44 ( here @xmath45 ) and the perpendicular magnetic - induction component @xmath35 as free parameters ; ( 2 ) determination of the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath35 using the biot- savart law .",
    "the latter part of the problem ( solution of the integral equation given by the biot - savart law ) has already been studied carefully in previous works @xcite . in the present work we concentrate on the analysis of the distribution of fields and currents throughout the film thickness ( @xmath15-dependence ) .",
    "the accuracy of our approach is determined by the ratio of the diffusion current @xmath47 to the bending current @xmath48 , since we neglect the diffusion current contribution to the total current .",
    "suppose , as a rough estimation , that @xmath49@xcite .",
    "then , the diffusion current density is roughly @xmath50 , whereas the bending current density is @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "thus , the ratio between the diffusion and the bending current is approximately @xmath52 for typical thin films . note that this condition does not depend on the magnitude of the critical current and is well satisfied also in typical single crystals , where @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the results we obtain below hold for a wide range of typical samples used in the experiment .",
    "let us consider the static case when vortices do not move , hence there is no friction .",
    "then , eq . ( [ vor - tr ] ) becomes @xmath54 excluding the @xmath33 component of the magnetic induction from eqs .",
    "( [ lon ] ) and ( [ vor - st ] ) we obtain equation for the vortex displacement : @xmath55    the two length scales which govern distributions over the @xmath15-axis become evident if one tries to find a general solution of equation [ vort - gen ] in the form @xmath56 .",
    "then , the dispersion equation for @xmath57 is bi - quadratic and yields two negative values for @xmath58 . in the limit",
    "@xmath59 ( weak bulk pinning ) : @xmath60 @xmath61    thus , the distribution along the @xmath62axis is characterized by the two length scales : the campbell length @xmath63 , which is the electrodynamic length , and length @xmath64 , given by eq .",
    "( [ k-1 ] ) , which is related to @xmath7 and the vortex - line tension .      in order to determine distribution of currents and fields throughout the film thickness",
    ", one must add the proper boundary conditions to the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ vort - gen ] ) .",
    "we look for a solution which is a superposition of two modes . in particular , for the vortex displacement we can write : @xmath65 using eq .",
    "( [ vor - st ] ) one has for the current density : @xmath66 the total current is @xmath67 equation ( [ curr - tot ] ) is in fact a boundary condition imposed on the amplitudes of two modes , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the second boundary condition is determined by the strength of the surface pinning .",
    "if displacements are small , the general form of this boundary condition is @xmath70 where @xmath71 in the absence of surface pinning and @xmath72 in the limit of strong surface pinning . in the following parts of the section we consider these two limits .",
    "let us consider the case of surface pinning in the absence of bulk pinning ( @xmath73 ) , when the campbell length @xmath74 ( see eq .",
    "( [ k-2 ] ) ) . by `` surface",
    "pinning '' we understand pinning due to surface roughness on the surfaces _ perpendicular _ to the vortex direction .",
    "the surface roughness is assumed to be much smaller than the film thickness @xmath2 . by substituting @xmath74 in the general solution eq .",
    "( [ u - pin ] ) , we derive the displacement for surface pinning : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are constants , which can be determined from the boundary conditions eqs .",
    "( [ curr - tot ] ) and ( [ bc ] ) .",
    "note , however , that @xmath76 is not important in the case of surface pinning , because the constant @xmath76 does not affect distributions of currents and fields .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath33 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ vor - st ] ) : @xmath78 and the current is determined from the maxwell equation ( [ max ] ) neglecting the diffusion current : @xmath79    it is important to note that the characteristic length @xmath64 , which varies between the london penetration length @xmath7 and the inter - vortex distance @xmath80 , is much smaller than @xmath81 for a dense vortex array , @xmath82 .",
    "taking into account that usually thin films have thickness less or equal to @xmath83 , the effect of the vortex bending due to surface pinning may be very important : most of the current is confined to a thin surface layer of width @xmath84 .",
    "the current density on the surface is @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "thus , @xmath87    the total current integrated over the film thickness @xmath12 is : @xmath88 thus , the _ average _ current density @xmath89 - the quantity derived in the experiment - decreases with thickness as @xmath90 yielding @xmath91 for @xmath92 as found experimentally @xcite .",
    "the field and the current distribution over the film thickness are : @xmath93 @xmath94 thus , the current penetrates into a small depth @xmath95 and is exponentially small in the bulk beyond this length .",
    "a remarkable feature of the perpendicular geometry is that , even in the absence of surface pinning , vortices are bent .",
    "this is in striking contrast with the parallel geometry where the diffusion current distribution is homogeneous along the direction of vortices and , therefore , does not bend them .",
    "absence of surface pinning means that at the surface @xmath96 ( a vortex is perpendicular to an ideal surface ) .",
    "this yields the relation between @xmath68 and @xmath69 [ see eq .",
    "( [ u - pin ] ) ] :    @xmath97    then , eq . ( [ curr - tot ] ) becomes    @xmath98    the current distribution is @xmath99 in the limit @xmath100 eq .",
    "( [ cur - dist ] ) yields @xmath101    another interesting case is that of the dense vortex array , @xmath102 : @xmath103 where again @xmath104 is the current density on the film surface .",
    "remarkably , current density is inhomogeneous even in the absence of surface pinning .",
    "we illustrate this in fig.1 , where we plot @xmath105 vs. @xmath106 at different ratios @xmath107 .",
    "`` uniform '' bulk current density @xmath108 corresponds to the limit @xmath109 .",
    "physically , such current profiles reflect meissner screening of the in - plane component @xmath110 of the self - field .    for the average current density we have @xmath111 which is similar to the case of the surface pinning , eq .",
    "( [ ja - surf ] ) , with @xmath64 replaced by @xmath63 .",
    "thus , in the perpendicular geometry , the current distribution is strongly inhomogeneous : the whole current is confined to a narrow surface layer of width @xmath64 ( surface pinning ) , or @xmath63 ( bulk pinning ) .      in the theory given in the previous sections we have assumed that currents and vortex displacements are small . in this section",
    "we deal with the critical state when the current density equals its critical value @xmath112 .",
    "let us consider how it can affect our picture , derived in the previous sections for small currents .      if vortices are pinned only at the surface , the value of the critical current depends on the profile of the surface , and one may not use the linear boundary condition imposed on the vortex displacement , eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) .",
    "however , the @xmath15-independent vortex displacement @xmath68 does not influence the current density and field distribution in the bulk as shown in sec .",
    "[ sp ] ( see eqs .",
    "( [ b - x ] ) and ( [ j - y ] ) ) .",
    "therefore the bulk current density and field distribution derived from our linear analysis can be used even for the critical state .      in this case our theory must be modified for the critical state . in particular , for large currents",
    "the bulk pinning force becomes nonlinear and , as a result , the current and field penetration is not described by simple exponential modes .",
    "formally , this nonlinearity may be incorporated into our theory assuming a @xmath22 - dependent pinning constant @xmath113 , thus allowing @xmath113 to vary along the vortex line . as an example , let us consider the case of strongly localized pinning force when the vortex is pinned by a potential well of a small radius @xmath114 like that sketched in fig.2 : the vortex energy per unit length ( vortex - line tension ) is given by @xmath115 for vortex line segments outside the potential well and by @xmath116 for segments inside the well .",
    "thus , the pinning energy per unit length is @xmath117 .",
    "in fact , such a potential well model may describe pinning of vortices by , for example , one - dimensional columnar defects or planar defects , such as twin or grain boundaries@xcite .",
    "the latter is relevant in thin films obtained by usual method of laser ablation .",
    "therefore , we can also use such a pinning potential as a rough qualitative model for typical types of pinning sites , in order to illustrate the effect of bulk pinning on the current density distribution and the rate of magnetic relaxation in thin films .",
    "if the current distribution were uniform , such a potential well would keep the vortex pinned until the current density @xmath118 exceeds the critical value @xmath119 .",
    "the escape of the trapped vortex line from the potential well occurs via formation of the un - trapped circular segment of the vortex line ( see fig.3(a ) ) . in this case",
    ", both the critical - current density and the energy barrier for vortex depinning do not depend on film thickness @xcite .",
    "but , in perpendicular geometry the current distribution is not homogeneous . in order to find it for the critical state",
    ", we may use the following approach .",
    "the vortex line consists of the trapped and untrapped segments as shown in fig.3(b ) .",
    "the untrapped segment is beyond the potential well , therefore there is no bulk pinning force acting on it .",
    "this means that the shape of this segment is described by eq .",
    "( [ vor - st ] ) with @xmath120 .",
    "applying the theory of sec .",
    "[ sp ] , one obtains that the total current @xmath121 is concentrated near the film surfaces within a narrow surface layer of width @xmath64 . inside the surface layer",
    "the vortex line is curved , but has a straight segment of length @xmath3 outside the layer , as illustrated in fig.3(b ) . as for the vortex - line segment trapped by the potential",
    "well , we assume that it is straight and vertical , neglecting its possible displacements inside the potential well . formally speaking , our approach introduces a non - homogeneous bulk - pinning constant @xmath113 assuming that @xmath120 for the untrapped segment and @xmath122 for the trapped one .",
    "the energy of the vortex line in this state is determined by the line tensions ( @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) and is given by @xmath123 where the contact angle @xmath124 is determined by the balance of the line - tension forces at the point where the vortex line meets the line defect : @xmath125",
    "we now discuss the effect of current density distribution on the thickness dependence of magnetic relaxation .",
    "we first show below , that uniform current density can not explain the experimentally observed thickness dependence .",
    "we also show that inhomogeneous current density distribution , resulting from the surface pinning only , can not explain the experimental data too .",
    "we demonstrate that only presence of a bulk pinning and the resulting current inhomogeneity may lead to an accelerated relaxation in thinner films .",
    "we finally discuss the general case when both bulk and surface pinning are present .",
    "as pointed out above , if the current distribution is uniform throughout the film thickness , a trapped vortex may escape from the potential well ( fig.2 ) via formation of a circular segment of the vortex line ( fig.3(a ) ) , with the energy @xmath126 where @xmath3 and @xmath127 are the lengths of the vortex line segment before and after formation of the loop , @xmath128 is the area of the loop @xcite . if the loop is a circular arc of the radius @xmath129 and the angle @xmath130 ( fig.3(a ) ) , then @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 , where the contact angle @xmath124 is given by eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath134 the height of the barrier is determined by the maximum energy at @xmath135 : @xmath136 as one might expect , this barrier and consequently the relaxation rate do not depend on the film thickness .",
    "we stress that this estimation is valid only for @xmath137 . if @xmath138  the energy barrier is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ e - par - fin ] ) by substituting @xmath139 this case of uniform current , however , leads to a thickness independent current density , and therefore can not describe the experimental data .      in this case ,",
    "the whole current is confined to the surface layer of width @xmath140 .",
    "it is apparent from eq .",
    "( [ k-2 ] ) that for typical experimental fields ( @xmath141 ) @xmath64 is smaller than the film thickness .",
    "this means that current flows mostly in a thin surface layer .",
    "thus , all creep parameters , including the creep barrier , are governed by the total current @xmath142 , and not by the average current density @xmath143 .",
    "then , apparently , the critical current density and the creep barrier are larger for thinner films , similar to the case of the collective- pinning effect mentioned above .",
    "thus , also this scenario can not explain the observed accelerated relaxations in the thinner films .",
    "let us consider the relaxation process for a critical state supported by the short - range pinning force discussed in sec .",
    "the energy @xmath144 of the vortex line is given by eq .",
    "( [ e - j ] ) .",
    "the average critical current density corresponds to @xmath145 and is inversely proportional to the film thickness [ see also eq .",
    "( [ ja - bulk ] ) ] : @xmath146 the energy barrier is given by the maximum energy at @xmath147 when the whole vortex line has left the potential well ( fig.4(a ) ) : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the average current density . if @xmath150 , then @xmath151 , i.e. , the barrier is larger for thinner films .",
    "but , for @xmath152 the derivative @xmath153 , and the barrier _ increases _ with the increase of the film thickness .",
    "thus , under this condition ( @xmath152 ) the magnetic relaxation rate is larger in the thinner samples .",
    "the above analysis did not take into account the possibility for dense defects . by `` dense '' we mean that the distance @xmath154 from the neighbor potential well is less than @xmath155 ( see fig.4(b ) ) . in this case",
    "the maximal energy ( the barrier peak ) is smaller than the barrier calculated in eq .",
    "( [ bar - j ] ) .",
    "then the barrier energy is given by @xmath156 in this case @xmath151 and the energy barrier for thinner films is always larger .",
    "therefore one can see faster relaxation in thinner films only if the films are so thin that @xmath157 and the energy barrier is given by eq .",
    "( [ bar - j ] ) . from the experimental results shown below",
    "we infer that the average distance between effective defects @xmath158  in agreement with direct measurements using atomic force microscopy .    to conclude ,",
    "if the average current density in thin films becomes small enough compared to the original critical current density and if the films are thin enough , the relaxation _ at the same average persistent current _ is predicted to be faster for the thinner films .      in the simplified picture of the critical - state relaxation outlined in the previous subsection",
    ", the total current was concentrated within a very thin layer of the width @xmath64 .",
    "it was based on the assumption that the pinning force disappears when the vortex line leaves the small - size potential well , whereas inside the potential well the pinning force is very strong . as a result , outside the thin surface layers of the width @xmath140 the vortex line consists of two straight segments ( figs.3(b ) and 4 ) . in the general case",
    ", the distribution of the pinning force may be smoother and the shape of a vortex line is more complicated .",
    "in addition , interactions between the vortices may modify the barrier for flux creep as well .",
    "however , the tendency must be the same : the current confined in a narrow surface layer drives the end of a vortex line away from the potential well to the regions where the pinning force is weaker and the vortex line is quite straight with the length proportional to thickness of the film if the latter is thin enough .",
    "therefore , the barrier height for the vortex jump is smaller for smaller @xmath2 .",
    "we also note that we do not consider an anisotropic case and limit our discussion to isotropic samples .",
    "the effect of anisotropy on the barrier height was considered in details in ref.@xcite in the presence of anisotropy the circular loop becomes elliptic and the vortex - line tension @xmath159  must be replaced by some combination of vortex - line tensions for different crystal directions .",
    "these quantitative modifications are not essential for our qualitative analysis .",
    "our scenario assumes that the current is concentrated near the film surfaces . in general , width of the current layer",
    "may vary from @xmath160 to effective campbell length @xmath6 .",
    "one may then expect a _",
    "non - monotonous _ thickness dependence when @xmath6 is comparable with @xmath2 . as we see , the campbell length is an important quantity in determining whether current density inhomogeneity must be taken into account or not ( in the absence of the surface pinning ) .",

    "a decrease of the measured current density with an increase of the film thickness is reported in numerous experimental works @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the predictions given above for either surface or / and bulk pinning .",
    "both pinning mechanisms predict similar @xmath168 dependence of @xmath0 and it is , therefore , impossible to distinguish between surface and bulk pinning in this type of measurements .",
    "only the additional information from the thickness dependence of the relaxation rate allows the drawing of some conclusions about the pinning mechanisms .",

    "we note , however , that since the value of @xmath104 is not known , we can not point out the dominance of pure surface , pure bulk or a mixed type of pinning . on the other hand",
    "it is unlikely that the observed thickness dependence is due to changes in the density of pinning centers with thickness , since the films morphology is similar for all of our samples .",
    "this is further indirectly confirmed by the relaxation measurements .",
    "the decrease of current density due to increase of a mean grain size in thicker films would simultaneously result in faster relaxation , contrary to our observations .",
