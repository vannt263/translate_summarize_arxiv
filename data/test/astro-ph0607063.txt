    "blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei and their high energy emission is generated in regions near the central super massive black holes . because of their intense and rapidly variable radiation , the emission regions are thought to be in relativistic jets closely aligned to the line of sight ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars are characterized by double broad peaks in the @xmath9-@xmath10 representation .",
    "one peak is in the optical to x - ray regions and the other is in the @xmath0-ray region .",
    "very high energy ( 100 mev  1 gev ) @xmath0-rays from blazars were discovered by _ egret _",
    "( energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ) on board compton gamma - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "recent observations by cerenkov telescopes have revealed that many blazars emit @xmath0-rays up to tens of tev ( * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "flare activities in x - rays and @xmath0-rays from blazars are also known .",
    "although the emission mechanisms of blazars are still under study , the seds of blazars are well explained by leptonic or hadronic models . in the framework of the leptonic models , the emission in the optical to x - ray region is attributed to synchrotron radiation by nonthermal electrons / positrons in the jet and the tev @xmath0-rays are accounted for by the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model @xcite .",
    "the ssc model assumes that synchrotron photons are inverse - compton scattered by the same nonthermal electrons / positrons that emit synchrotron photons .",
    "if the ssc model is applied , the time variabilities of the x - rays and @xmath0-rays should be correlated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and indeed most flares occur almost simultaneously in x - rays and @xmath0-rays",
    ". however , the recent observations of 1es 1959 + 650 @xcite found that there is a tev @xmath0-ray flare that is not accompanied by a x - ray flare , which was observed on june 4 , 2002 ( mjd 52,429 ) by the whipple telescope .",
    "this is called the `` orphan '' tev @xmath0-ray ( otg ) flare .",
    "the otg flare occurred about 15 days after a usual flare in which x - ray and @xmath0-ray flares were observed contemporaneously .",
    "more recently another otg flare might have been observed from mrk 421 @xcite , although the x - ray flux seems to have peaked about 1.5 days before this tev flare and this may not be a true otg flare .    the existence of the otg flares is challenging for the leptonic models .",
    "@xcite has recently proposed a model for the otg flare of es 1959 + 650 , i.e. , the hadronic synchrotron mirror model .",
    "he assumed that a fraction of x - rays produced in the primary flare by synchrotron radiation of leptons is reflected by a plasma cloud with scattering depth @xmath11 located in the direction of the jet propagation .",
    "the reflected x - rays collide with protons in the jet and pions are produced .",
    "subsequently a large number of neutral pions decay into @xmath0-rays , which are expected to be observed as tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "if this model is applied to 1es 1959 + 650 , it is found that the reflecting plasma is located at a distance @xmath12 pc from the central black hole , where @xmath5 is the bulk lorentz factor of the jet and @xmath13 is the normalized time delay between the primary and otg flares .",
    "this model requires unreasonably large values of proton density in the jet and the hadronic jet power ( bttcher 2006 : erratum ) .",
    "thus the hadronic synchrotron mirror model may not be applicable to otg flares , although it may be still viable if the effects that reflected synchrotron photons increase as the blob approaches to the mirror are taken into account .",
    "( more recently @xcite calculated the predicted neutrino spectrum due to the decay of charged pions in the framework of the hadronic synchrotron mirror model . )    in this paper , we propose another model of the otg flares in the framework of the ssc model , assuming that the emission region is not homogeneous , which is different from the conventional ssc model .",
    "we assume that the injection of nonthermal electrons / positrons triggers the primary flare where both x - rays and tev @xmath0-rays are emitted . if the jet is not uniform but consists of a few patchy regions , x - rays that were produced in the primary flare impinge on another dense region of the jet .",
    "this sudden increase of x - ray photons results in strong tev @xmath0-ray flux by inverse compton scattering , which is expected to be observed as an otg flare . because there is a time delay between the primary flare in one region and the scattering in another region , tev @xmath0-rays",
    "are observed as an otg flare .",
    "note that tev @xmath0-rays from the primary flare are not scattered in the otg flare site because of klein - nishina effects .",
    "the observed delay time between the otg flare and the previous flare is about two weeks in 1es 1959 + 650 @xcite .",
    "the delay time between the primary and otg flares in the comoving frame of the jet is much shorter than the synchrotron cooling time of nonthermal electrons / positrons ( see  [ sec : lumi ] for detail ) , if the magnetic field in the jet is about 0.1 g. although high energy electrons / positrons injected into the primary flare are rapidly cooled , nonthermal electrons / positrons that emit tev @xmath0-rays in a quiescent state may be still continuously injected into the jet and they may contribute to the secondary flare . in this paper",

    "we assume that the high energy particles are confined in a patchy shell and high density regions are located at p and s@xmath16 in the shell .",
    "the emission mechanisms in a flare are synchrotron emission and ssc for x - rays and tev @xmath0-rays , respectively .",
    "a fraction of the emitted photons propagate along directions that are slightly off from the jet axis and they are injected into the high density region around s , where s was located at s@xmath16 when the primary flare occurred .",
    "the injected tev @xmath0-rays are in klein - nishina regime and are not scattered but x - rays are compton - scattered to become tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "this triggers the secondary ( otg ) flare in the tev region .",

    "this value is close to the observed delay time of the otg flare in 1es 1959 + 650 @xcite .",
    "these parameters give the distance of s from the central black hole @xmath45 pc .",
    "there is another possibility of the jet geometry ( case 2 ) as shown in figure [ fig : jet - case2 ] .",

    "when @xmath62 , @xmath63 is required to explain @xmath61 2 weeks for the same parameter values as the above .",
    "the solution obtained in  [ sec : kinematics ] gives the distance , s@xmath16s , that the emission region travels during @xmath17 as @xmath64 in the comoving frame of the jet , the travel time is given by @xmath65 if @xmath3 , we obtain @xmath66 days .",
    "here primed quantities are evaluated in the comoving frame of the jet .",
    "synchrotron cooling rate per electron in the comoving frame of the jet is given by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the magnetic energy density .",
    "then we obtain the cooling time as @xmath69 .",
    "the characteristic energy of synchrotron radiation is given by @xmath70 and the observed synchrotron photon energy is doppler shifted , i.e. , @xmath71 . because synchrotron photons with energy @xmath72 are emitted by electrons with a lorentz factor @xmath73 we obtain @xmath74 then we find that @xmath75 . because the cooling by inverse compton scattering is not negligible , the cooling time is much shorter than @xmath76 .",
    "thus relativistic electrons / positrons injected into the primary flare are already cooled when the secondary flare occurs . for the secondary flare to be caused ,",
    "the injection of relativistic electrons / positrons is necessary .",
    "the injection rate , however , does not need to be as high as in the primary flare . when synchrotron photons from the primary flare impinge on the dense region , which is located at the right place as described in ",
    "[ sec : kinematics ] , the secondary flare occurs by inverse compton scattering of those photons .",

    "in this paper we have proposed a structured jet model for the otg flares .",
    "the high energy emission spectra from tev blazars have been well explained by the leptonic jet models .",
    "because the leptonic jet models assume synchrotron self - compton scattering for the emission mechanism of very high energy @xmath0-rays , it is expected that flares occur in both x - ray and @xmath0-ray energy bands almost simultaneously .",
    "however , the otg flares were not accompanied by the simultaneous increase in the x - ray flux @xcite , and this is thought to be a challenging issue for the leptonic jet models . our model of a structured",
    "jet assumes that @xmath0-rays are emitted in different components in the jet .",
    "x - rays produced by a flare in a region , where flares in x - rays and tev @xmath0-rays occur simultaneously , are scattered in another region of the jet and the scattered photons are observed as a secondary ( otg ) flare .",
    "note that tev @xmath0-rays of the primary flare are not scattered by electrons / positrons because of klein - nishina effects .",
    "the emitted @xmath0-ray energy is estimated as @xmath84 , because the scattering occurs mainly in klein - nishina regime .",
    "then the observed @xmath0-ray energy is roughly given by @xmath85 using equation ( [ eq : gamma - value ] ) .    because the x - rays emitted in the primary flare need a propagation time before they are scattered in different parts of the jet , this results in the time delay between the primary and secondary flares . in our model ,",
    "the delay time between the primary flare and the secondary tev @xmath0-ray flare is dependent on @xmath5 , @xmath41 , @xmath51 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the observed delay time is about 15 days for 1es 1959 + 650 and this value is obtained for @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath2 cm in case 1 . as the value of @xmath41 decreases the value of @xmath6 increases for a given value of @xmath42 .",
    "if the value of @xmath5 is known from the observations of the primary flare , the values of @xmath41 and @xmath6 might be reasonably guessed from the delay time .",
    "it is not clear from the numerical values estimated in this paper whether case 1 is favored to case 2 or vice versa .",
    "rare observations of otg flares might be due to that this phenomenon needs a specific structure of the jets as shown in figures [ fig : jet - case1 ] or [ fig : jet - case2 ] .",
    "the duration of the secondary flare depends on the time interval of the primary flare and the angular size of the secondary flare site , @xmath86 .",
    "for example , in case 1 , if @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 and the primary flare is impulsive , the observed duration of the second flare is given by the difference between the values of @xmath42 for @xmath41 and @xmath88 : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is assumed .",
    "the values of @xmath91 are shown in figure [ fig : g - factor ] for case 1 .",
    "for example , @xmath92 for @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "if the observed duration of the secondary flare is about 5 hours , @xmath93 for @xmath3 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 cm .",
    "the observed duration of the secondary flare may depend on not only the value of @xmath94 but also the duration of the primary flare , and the effect of the latter elongates the duration of the secondary flare .",
    "we have shown that the time lag between the primary and secondary flares are well accounted for by our model .",
    "next we argue that the density of soft photons ( x - rays ) from the primary flare is high enough to produce the otg flare if the particle injection time in the primary flare is sufficiently long , and that the particle injection rate needed in the secondary flare is not unreasonably high .",
    "first , it should be noted that photons from the primary flare blob ( pb ) are not injected from the rear side of the secondary flare blob ( sb ) . in the comoving frame of the blobs ,",
    "the angle between the line of sight and the incident direction of photons from pb is about 90 degrees .",
    "then the energy boost by inverse compton scattering in sb should be effective , although the detailed calculations of radiative transfer are necessary to obtain the emission spectrum of tev @xmath0-rays from sb .",
    "next , we discuss the amount of radiation received by sb and the cooling time of leptons . in the following ,",
    "primed symbols are quantities during the primary flare in the comoving frame and doubly primed symbols are quantities during the secondary flare in the comoving frame .",
    "we assume that pb and sb are spherical plasma clouds for simplicity .",
    "the radii of pb and sb in the comoving frame at the occurrence of the primary flare are denoted by @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "the radius of sb at the time when the secondary flare occurs is denoted by @xmath97 .",
    "the solid angle extended by sb for a point in pb is given by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the distance between pb and sb : @xmath100 .",
    "if sb expands proportionally with the distance from the central black hole , @xmath101 .",
    "if radiation from pb is emitted isotropically in the comoving frame , the fraction of the radiation received by sb is given by @xmath102 we assumed @xmath103 cm ; this value is close to the values assumed for the emission region of the flare models of 1es 1959 + 650 in @xcite .",
    "thus the soft photon ( x - ray ) energy density in sb is roughly about 1/30 of that in pb and the compton cooling time of nonthermal particles in sb is longer by 30 times than in pb . on the other hand ,",
    "the flare duration in pb is determined by the injection duration of nonthermal particles , because the cooling time should be short owing to the large energy densities of soft photons and magnetic fields .",
    "thus the observed otg flare is explained , if the particle injection duration in pb is about 30 times longer than the cooling time in sb .",
    "furthermore , the energy densities of magnetic fields and internal synchrotron photons in sb are smaller than in pb , so that emission other than tev @xmath0-rays is too weak to be observed .    in the following we estimate the required injection rate of nonthermal leptons in the secondary flare .",
    "the observed energy flux of the secondary flare at 600gev is @xmath104 ergs s@xmath105 @xmath106 .",
    "the luminosity distance to 1es 1959 + 650 ( @xmath107 ) is @xmath108 mpc , assuming that @xmath109 km s@xmath105 mpc@xmath105 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , where @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 are the hubble constant and the density parameters of dark energy and matter , respectively .",
    "then the luminosity of the very high energy gamma - rays is @xmath115 ergs s@xmath105 .",
    "the luminosity in the comoving frame is given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the beaming factor of sb and @xmath118 and 20 for cases 1 and 2 , respectively , if @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the distance between the central black hole and sb is @xmath119 , where @xmath3 is assumed .",
    "assume that sb expands linearly with the distance from the central black hole .",
    "then the radius of sb is given by @xmath120 we obtain the energy injection rate per unit volume during the secondary flare : @xmath121 the injection rate of nonthermal leptons in sb is also given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the value of the characteristic lorentz factor of injected leptons in sb .",
    "when the energy injection rate during the primary flare is denoted by @xmath124 , we obtain @xmath125_\\mathrm{vhe , sec}}{[\\nu f_\\nu]_\\mathrm{vhe , prim } }   \\left(\\frac{{\\cal d}_\\mathrm{prim}}{{\\cal d}_\\mathrm{sec}}\\right)^4 \\left(\\frac{r'_\\mathrm{prim}}{r''_\\mathrm{sec}}\\right)^3 , \\ ] ] where @xmath126_\\mathrm{vhe , prim}$ ] and @xmath126_\\mathrm{vhe , sec}$ ] are the observed quantities of @xmath10 in the primary and secondary flares , respectively .",
    "if @xmath127 and @xmath128 are assumed , @xmath129_\\mathrm{vhe , sec } / [ \\nu f_\\nu]_\\mathrm{vhe , prim}$ ] , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 for cases 1 and 2 , respectively . from the observed data @xcite , we may set + @xmath126_\\mathrm{vhe , sec}/[\\nu f_\\nu]_\\mathrm{vhe , prim } \\sim 1 $ ] , and @xmath132 is obtained .",
    "thus the required value of @xmath133 is not unreasonably large .",
    "this particle energy is transfered to x - rays by inverse compton scattering to emit tev @xmath0-rays in the secondary flare .",
    "our model assumes a structured jet and the occurrence of otg flares depends on the geometry of dense regions in the jet . alternatively the dense regions might be widely distributed , e.g. , the layer - spine model by @xcite , and the value of @xmath41 depends on where the region of particle acceleration at pc - scale exists .",
    "finally we comment on the observed large scale structure of jets .",
    "the line of sight is inside the opening angle of jets in our model , and this may result in a core - halo structure of the emission region . however , since the emission regions of high energy radiation are located very close to the central black hole , the large scale structure of jets is affected by the environment of the jets .",
    "that is , the interaction between jets and gases surrounding the central region may cause the bending of the jets .",
