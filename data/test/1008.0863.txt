    "in adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) @xcite quantum algorithms are implemented by initializing a system in an easily prepared ground state , followed by adiabatic evolution subject to a hamiltonian whose final ground state represents the solution to a computational problem .",
    "it is known that this model is computationally equivalent to the standard circuit model of quantum computation , in the sense that each model can simulate the other with polynomial resource overhead @xcite . while error correction methods have been proposed for aqc @xcite , and arguments",
    "have been put forth that aqc  is inherently insensitive to certain types of errors @xcite , unlike the circuit model it is still an open question whether aqc  can be made fault tolerant subject to realistic noise models pertaining to aqc  in an open system setting . indeed , even what constitutes a consistent picture of adiabatic evolution in open systems is still the subject of some debate @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , experiments in aqc using superconducting qubits have made great strides recently @xcite .",
    "the performance of adiabatic quantum algorithms is characterized by the adiabatic error , i.e. , the fidelity loss between the actual time - evolved state ( the solution of the schrdinger equation ) and the instantaneous ground state , calculated at the final time @xmath0 . since the adiabatic theorem fock , kato , messiah : book , teufel : book guarantees that in the limit of arbitrarily slow evolution the error approaches zero , one expects that a more slowly varying hamiltonian and/or a longer evolution time should result in higher fidelity or accuracy .",
    "this is the _ accuracy - time tradeoff _ in quantum adiabatic algorithms .",
    "this tradeoff is often formalized by the adiabatic condition , which states ( roughly ) that the variation rate of the hamiltonian should be @xmath1 the adiabatic error times the gap squared .",
    "a clear disadvantage of this condition is the inherent vagueness of @xmath1 ,  which makes it difficult to reliably quantify the evolution time _ vs _ the desired accuracy .",
    "moreover , violations of the traditional adiabatic condition have been reported @xcite , in the sense that the condition is neither necessary nor sufficient for adiabatic evolution . while these violations have been explained as being either due to inconsistent manipulations @xcite or due to resonant transitions amin",
    ", it appears that there is no single adiabatic theorem .",
    "rather , a number of different rigorous conditions have been derived , which apply under various mathematical assumptions @xcite . a rigorous condition which holds for analytic hamiltonians and exibits the explicit scaling with system size , needed for aqc resource quantification ,",
    "was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we perform a comprehensive analysis of the adiabatic error for the case of an adiabatic quantum search algorithm , in a closed system setting .",
    "we focus on quantum search not only because it is an important example of a quantum speedup @xcite , but also because it is amenable to an exact analytical treatment .",
    "indeed , rather than relying on a particular form of the adiabatic theorem , our approach is based on an exact treatment of the underlying dynamics .",
    "we calculate the adiabatic error as an explicit function of the evolution time .",
    "we work out the formal @xmath2 expansion of the error  often used in rigorous treatments of the adiabatic theorem ",
    "through which we provide a large-@xmath0 _ polynomial _ upper bound for the adiabatic error .",
    "we shall argue that a leading order truncation of this series expansion can result in misleading estimates for the scaling of the evolution time _ vs _ system size .",
    "we draw this conclusion on the basis of a careful study of the adiabatic error , showing that it may exhibit a short-@xmath0 _ exponential _ decay , which is hidden in the formal polynomial expansion .",
    "we show that this short - time exponential decay heralds the correct scaling for the evolution time _ vs _ system size ( a quadratic speedup over classical search ) , avoiding the overestimation that results from the long - time polynomial decay , and which leads to a loss of the quantum speedup .",
    "additionally , we propose specific adiabatic evolution paths ( `` interpolations'')inspired by a procedure for minimization of time functionals for adiabatic evolution @xcite  and use these to illustrate our results .",
    "we also examine the applicability of the traditional measure of the evolution time and contrast this to what we obtain from our analysis .",
    "this careful analysis enables us to show explicitly how one can reduce the adiabatic error as a function of the evolution time .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we start with some general background in sec .",
    "[ ad - int ] by delineating the framework of adiabatic quantum computation , the definition of the adiabatic error , and the adiabatic theorem . in sec .",
    "[ qsham ] , we specialize to the specific problem of quantum search . there",
    "we introduce a general hamiltonian interpolation for the search problem , and analytically solve the corresponding schrdinger equation .",
    "section  [ aderror ] contains the core of our results .",
    "we first derive an exact expression for the adiabatic error in subsection  exactr .",
    "next , in subsection  [ approx ] , we approximate this expression and show how the polynomial and exponential behaviors emerge . since estimation of the adiabatic error requires specific interpolation paths , we derive a general interpolation for the search hamiltonian in subsection  ham , and investigate in detail three special cases . the adiabatic error for the general interpolation together with the special cases is estimated in subsection  [ erpaths ] . in subsection",
    "[ strategy ] , we discuss a strategy for controllably reducing the adiabatic error .",
    "there we show how one can employ a freedom in the interpolation to manipulate the adiabatic error .",
    "this accounts for the performance - resource tradeoff .",
    "we conclude with a summary of the results and an outlook in sec .",
    "we begin by defining the adiabatic error as it arises in the context of aqc .",
    "we also provide a brief review of some pertinent facts concerning the traditional  adiabatic theorem , also in the context of aqc .",
    "however , we note that in the sequel we shall not use the adiabatic theorem ; rather , we shall treat the dynamics directly by solving the schrdinger equation , and later enforce adiabaticity by means of a @xmath2 expansion .",
    "let us treat the total evolution time @xmath0 as a parameter and define the the scaled ( dimensionless ) time@xmath3.\\]]assume that we have an @xmath4-dimensional quantum system that evolves for a total time @xmath0 under the hamiltonian @xmath5 with spectral decomposition @xmath6",
    "\\label{h}\\]]where @xmath7 for @xmath8 , except that the ground state energy is separated from the rest of the spectrum by a nonvanishing gap @xmath9possible level crossing among excited eigenstates @xmath10 shall not concern us here because in the following we shall only focus on the ground state @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the system is closed , i.e. , the evolution is governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath12where from now on dot denotes @xmath13 , and we set @xmath14 .",
    "the initial state is assumed to be the ground state , i.e. , @xmath15    _ remark_. we shall use the subscript @xmath0 to indicate the parametric dependence on @xmath0 . when symbols already have a subscript we shall avoid the additional @xmath0 subscript so as not to clutter the notation .",
    "a central quantity of interest to us is the adiabatic error  @xmath16 , which quantifies the distance between the instantaneous ground state and the actual state : @xmath17note that @xmath16 is a distance and ( in)fidelity measure in their rigorous sense .",
    "indeed , the trace distance @xmath18 and fidelity @xmath19 between two arbitrary density operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 are defined as @xcite @xmath22where @xmath23 is the trace norm ( sum of singular values of @xmath24 ) . for pure states @xmath25 it is not hard to show that @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "thus@xmath28    an equivalent and useful formulation of @xmath16 is the following .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the ground - state eigenprojection .",
    "the connection between the initial preparation @xmath30 and the time evolved state @xmath31 is given by @xmath32where the unitary operator @xmath33called the adiabatic intertwiner @xcite  determines the evolution in the eigenspace @xmath31 and its orthogonal complement @xmath34 : @xmath35one can assign a ( dimensionless ) adiabatic hamiltonian ,  @xmath36 , to this evolution defined via @xmath37on the other hand , the evolution operator generated as @xmath38dictates the actual dynamics : @xmath39thus the error @xmath16 in fact measures the difference between @xmath40 and @xmath33 , or equivalently how far the unitary operator @xmath41is from @xmath42 ( identity ) .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath43which vanishes iff @xmath44 .",
    "the above formulations have presumed that the degeneracy of the ground - state eigensubspace does not change in time .",
    "nonetheless , there may be situations in which this degeneracy preservation assumption does not hold .",
    "in fact , as we shall see later , the quantum search problem we study in this paper falls into this category .",
    "let us assume that the initial state is pure , @xmath45 , but the instantaneous ground - state eigenprojection @xmath31 is not necessarily rank-@xmath46 , accounting for the possibility of degeneracy .",
    "intuitively , if the actual state @xmath47 only has components in the support of @xmath31 the algorithm has achieved its goal at the instant @xmath48 , whereas a less than full overlap denotes lack of success at this instant .",
    "the overlap of @xmath49 and the support of @xmath31 can be quantified , e.g. , with @xmath50 , whence we define the following performance error : @xmath51it is evident that @xmath52 , with @xmath53 iff the actual state has vanishing overlap with the support of the instantaneous ground - state eigenprojection , while @xmath54 iff the actual state resides anywhere in the support .",
    "we can write @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56=\\mathrm{tr}[p(0)\\omega _ { t}(\\tau ) p(0)\\omega _ { t}^{\\dag } ( \\tau ) ] $ ] . using this ,",
    "note the difference between @xmath57|^{2}}\\]]and @xmath58}.\\]]namely , in the nondegenerate case @xmath59 iff @xmath60 , indicating that the evolution was perfectly adiabatic . in the degenerate case ,",
    "on the other hand , algorithmic success does not require the evolution to be perfectly adiabatic since only nonvanishing overlap with the ground - state eigensubspace is required , i.e. , @xmath54 iff @xmath61 $ ] , whereas complete failure requires the dynamics to remove any overlap with the ground - state eigensubspace , i.e. , @xmath53 iff @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "while the error as defined in eq .",
    "( [ error - final - form ] ) is not necessarily a distance in the strict sense , it is adequate for quantifying the adiabatic error .",
    "note also that @xmath63 reduces to @xmath16 when the ground state is nondegenerate . from now on we shall be using these various expressions for the adiabatic error as appropriate in the rest of this paper .",
    "one variant of the traditionaladiabatic theorem @xcite states that given an @xmath64 and a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath65 with a nondegenerate ground state , the adiabatic error satisfies @xmath66 , provided that @xmath67 in which @xmath68 is the standard operator norm , defined as the maximum singular value , i.e. , @xmath69 which reduces to @xmath70 for normal operators .",
    "as remarked in the introduction , this condition is hardly quantitative due to the intrinsic vagueness of @xmath1 , and has been the subject of critique ( consistent with its lack of rigor ) @xcite , justifications @xcite , and rigorous improvements avron:871,avron:872,nenciu:93,martinez , hagedornjoye:02,jrs , ohara:042319,boixo , lrh .",
    "nevertheless , it remains a useful rule of thumb , as long as it is applied with appropriate care .",
    "an immediate implication of the adiabatic theorem is that , assuming it is initialized in the ground state , the system remains close to the final ground state at @xmath71 .",
    "thus , by choosing the hamiltonian such that @xmath72 corresponds to a _",
    "simple _ ground state @xmath73 ( simple in the sense that it is easily preparable ) , and @xmath74 represents a hamiltonian whose ground state @xmath75 identifies the solution to a computationally _ hard _ problem , one can devise an adiabatic version for the corresponding algorithmic or computational task .",
    "this is precisely the insight that led to the advent of aqc @xcite .",
    "a simple `` annealing schedule '' , or `` path '' , between @xmath72 and @xmath74 is the following linear interpolation in @xmath48 : @xmath76 in physical situations , however , one often realizes the dynamics by tuning some time - dependent control knobs or couplings @xmath77 of the hamiltonian .",
    "this suggests that a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ aaa ] ) can be introduced by assuming access to a controllable set of non - commuting , linearly - independent primitive hamiltonians @xmath78 combined , e.g. , as @xmath79=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}x_{i}(\\tau ) h_{i}$ ] .",
    "further generalizations can be introduced as well @xcite . however , for our purposes in this paper we shall consider the parametrization rolandcerf , qab @xmath80with the boundary conditions @xmath81    two remarks are in order regarding aqc .",
    "( i ) a primary goal in aqc is to make @xmath82 decrease more rapidly for a given @xmath0 and problem size , or alternatively , to make @xmath0 smaller for a given @xmath83 and problem size .",
    "often the problem size is given by @xmath4 , the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "however , in the context of many - body quantum systems , where the hilbert space is a tensor product of subsystems ( e.g. , qubits ) , @xmath84 is the correct measure of problem size , coinciding with system size .",
    "( ii ) the run time  complexity of a quantum algorithm should be defined as @xmath85not @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this _ regularization _ is required because of the energy - time tradeoff in quantum mechanics , in the sense that multiplication of @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) by some positive factor @xmath86 manifests itself as dividing @xmath0 by the same factor , making it possible to decrease @xmath0 arbitrarily by choosing @xmath86 sufficiently large .",
    "this tradeoff can also be understood via the schrdinger equation ( [ eqscalt ] ) , in which the final state of a system evolving under hamiltonian @xmath65 for @xmath0 is the same as that of a system evolving under @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "this ambiguity is fixed by the definition of @xmath89 as in eq .",
    "( [ runt ] ) .",
    "scaling of @xmath90 with system size , for a given upper bound on the error @xmath91 , determines the run time complexity of the corresponding quantum algorithm .",
    "grover s quantum search algorithm @xcite performs a search for @xmath92 marked  items among @xmath4 items of an unsorted database , presuming that there is an oracle  for distinguishing the marked from the unmarked items .",
    "the algorithm in its original form ( @xmath93 ) comprises the following steps : ( i ) assign orthonormal quantum states ( i.e. , labels ) @xmath94 to the items , ( ii ) prepare the quantum system in the equal superposition state @xmath95 , and ( iii ) apply the grover operator  encompassing the oracle ",

    "the initial state @xmath105 is the ground state of the initial hamiltonian @xmath106 , while any state supported fully on @xmath102 is a ground state of the final ( oracle ) hamiltonian @xmath107 .",
    "note that unlike previous treatments of adiabatic quantum search @xcite , the hamiltonian @xmath107 has a degenerate ground eigenspace spanned by @xmath108 .",
