    "another consideration is that the magnetization precession in thin films is not circular but elliptic due to strong demagnetizing fields , which force the magnetization into the film - plane .",
    "having the applied mw field oriented along the long / short elliptic trajectory in the two geometries will affect how effectively the fmr is excited .",
    "this determines the cone angle of the magnetization precession , which could also cause a small shift in resonance field and linewidth .",

    "while these trends present strong evidence for the effects of eddy currents on fmr in a single layer of py , care should be taken when comparing the absorption amplitude for the two field geometries .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitude2]a , an in - plane orientation of the mw field results in an increase in amplitude compared to the same samples measured with an out - of - plane mw field .",
    "this is partially attributed to the screening effect of the applied mw field by the induced fields from eddy currents , but there are additional factors which also needs to be considered .",
    "in the two measurement geometries the sample orientation with respect to the magnetic mode in the cavity is different , which could affect the detector coupling coefficient @xmath49 . as the recorded signal amplitude is proportional to @xmath49 , this would introduce a scaling offset in the signal amplitudes .",
    "another consideration is the aforementioned ellipticity of the magnetization precession in thin films . having the mw field oriented along the long / short elliptic trajectory in the two geometries will affect the fmr excitation , and by this the absorption amplitude .",
    "the difference in amplitudes between the two geometries could thus be caused by a combination of several factors .",
    "the main point to note is rather the dependence of absorption amplitude vs. sample area , whether a linear trend is observed or not . to explain the observed trend in the fmr absorption amplitude vs. disc radius in fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitude2]a , which show a maximum for an intermediate disc radius , we consider a simple current loop model :    from electromagnetic theory we know that the induced electromotive force ( emf ) , @xmath50 , is proportional to the time derivative of the magnetic flux enclosed by the sample , and @xmath50 will thus increase proportional to the sample area . at the same time , approximating the current path as a circular loop around the edges of the sample , the resistance , r , of the loop scales linearly with the radius @xmath25 .",
    "this means that the magnitude of the induced current should scale linearly with the sample radius , as @xmath51 . as the simplest case we consider the magnetic field from a circular current loop , given by eqs.([eq : bz ] ) and ( [ eq : br ] ) . for a single layer of py",

    ", the magnitude of the induced current should scale linearly with the disk radius . using these approximations results in that the magnetic field at the center of the loop is independent of the loop radius .",
    "this can not simply explain the observed maximum in the fmr absorption amplitude for an intermediate disc radius in fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitude2]a . however , one of the approximations used was that one could consider the induced current as a single current loop localized at the sample edge . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : current_distr]a , this approximation is not independent of the disc radius . for small discs ,",
    "even if the current density is highest along the edges , it is still more evenly distributed throughout the sample .",
    "the current distribution also determines the balance between in - plane and out - of - plane components of the corresponding induced mw field perturbing the fm .",
    "determining the relative magnitude of the mw field components is in general a complicated problem , and would require a simultaneous numerical solution of the coupled maxwells and llg equations @xcite for the various sample geometries .",
    "however , previous observations indicate that the induced field perturbing the fm can be comparable and in some cases even larger than the applied mw field , due to the close proximity to the induced currents at the fm / nm interface @xcite .",
    "two limiting cases are worth considering : a uniform current distribution in the sample would result in induced field components having only in - plane components ( analogous to the magnetic field from a current in an infinite conducting plane ) . on the other hand , a localized current at the sample edge would produce mainly out of plane components of the corresponding magnetic field in the sample plane .",
    "as the applied mw field is oriented perpendicular to the sample plane , having induced field components perpendicular to the plane is needed in order to partially compensate the applied field .",

    ", the induced fields will have the main component perpendicular to the sample plane , and could thus partially compensate the applied mw field . a compensation effect , reducing the effective mw field exciting the fmr , would lead to the decrease in the absorption amplitude which is observed for the larger samples .      by adding nm layers with a high conductivity compared to the py layer one can control the dominant current paths , and thus also the induced mw fields .",

    "the conductivity of au is significantly higher than for py , with @xmath53 @xcite .",

    "[ fig : pyau_all]b ) .",
    "the shift in resonance field and linewidth between the two sample series can be explained by a slight variation in material properties , as the samples were deposited at two separate occasions .",

    "the amplitude approaches zero .",
    "we interpret this as an almost complete compensation of the applied mw field by the induced fields from eddy currents in the nm ring , suggesting a strong screening effect .        for the resonance field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : halo1]b ) we observe an increase of @xmath7170 oe compared to that of the previous sample series , which indicates a reduction in the saturation magnetization .",
    "the preparation of this sample series involves an extra lithography step , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : sampleprep ] , and this could cause a reduced film quality compared to the other samples .",
    "a reduced film quality is consistent with the increased linewidth ( fig .",
    "[ fig : halo1]d ) , which is in the order of 10 oe larger than for the other samples .",
    "however , we do not observe any clear trend in the linewidth as a function of disc size or nm ring width .",
    "this corresponds well with what one would expect if the change in linewidth for the pyau bilayers in fig .",
    "[ fig : pyau_all]d is caused by the excitation of spin waves . in this last series , due to the sample geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : field_geometry_halo ] , there will be no in - plane field components . without any mixing of in - plane vs. out - of - plane field components , one should thus not expect any spin wave excitations and corresponding fmr linewidth broadening .    by investigating the lineshape assymetry in fig . [",
    "fig : halo1]c for a nm ring width ranging from 10 - 100 @xmath64 m , we observe that the asymmetry increases with both the nm ring width and fm disc radius .",
    "( for a nm ring width of 250 @xmath64 m , the absorption amplitude was to low to get a good estimate of the linewidth and lineshape asymmetry ) . as mentioned previously in sec .",
    "[ sec : pyau ] the sign of @xmath8 depends on the sample geometry , and we note here that @xmath8 has a negative sign , same as for the single py discs in sec .",
    "[ sec : py_single ] .",
    "this is due to the similar sample geometry where the current loop ( flowing mainly in the nm ring ) is in the same plane as the fm disc .",
    "this is in contrast to the pyau bilayers in sec .",
    "[ sec : pyau ] where the current is flowing mainly in the adjacent au layer , and a positive @xmath8 is observed .",
    "the most interesting observation for this sample series , is the significant screening effect .",
    "the fmr absorption amplitude in fig .",
    "[ fig : halo1]a indicates that the induced fields from eddy currents in the nm ring are able to almost completely compensate the applied mw field for a nm ring width of 250 @xmath64 m , where the absorption amplitude drops to near zero . to estimate the compensation of the applied mw field",
    "by induced fields from eddy currents , we consider a simple current loop model : the induced electromotive force ( emf ) @xmath50 is given by the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the area enclosed by the current loop ; its absolute value is given by @xmath72 .",
    "the induced current is then given by , @xmath73 where r is the resistance of the current loop .",
    "the resistance of the au ring is given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the resistivity of au , @xmath76 is the width of the nm ring and @xmath43 is the thickness of the au layer . as discussed previously in section [ sec : pyau ] , the expressions for the magnetic field at the center of a circular current loop of radius @xmath25 in the x - y plane given by eqs.([eq : bz ] ) and ( [ eq : br ] ) simplify to the well know expression : @xmath77 .",
    "we are here interested in the condition where the induced field is comparable in strength to the applied mw field , @xmath78 . fulfilling this relation ,",
    "one obtains the following expression for the nm ring width :    @xmath79    a microwave frequency @xmath80 ghz , au thickness of @xmath81 nm and the standard textbook value of resistivity , @xmath75 , results in a nm ring width of @xmath82 @xmath64 m . comparing the model calculation to experimental data , we observe such a compensation already at @xmath83 @xmath64 m . however ,",
    "in this simplified model we only consider induced fields from currents in the nm ring . as we have discussed previously in section",
    "[ sec : py_single ] , and shown in fig [ fig : amplitude2]a , induced currents in the py disc also affects the absorption amplitude . taking the compensation effect from the py disc into account",
    "would result in that a thinner nm ring width is needed to compensate the applied mw field .",
    "this is consistent with the results from our simplified current loop model , which overestimate the nm ring width compared to the experimental result .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that eddy - current effects can have a significant impact on the fmr excitation even in very thin metallic fm ( @xmath3 nm py ) , determined by the sample and mw field geometry .",
    "our results indicate how patterned fm / nm structures can be used to control the induced current paths .",
    "the corresponding mw fields have a relative phase shift with respect to the applied mw field , which depends on the sample geometry .",
    "the induced fields produced by eddy currents can thus be used to compensate the applied mw field , as an effective screening of the fm in selected parts of the sample .",
    "we also provide evidence that controlling the local mw field enables the excitation of spin wave modes with a non - zero wave vector ( @xmath84 ) , in contrast to the the uniform ( @xmath1 ) mode normally excited in fmr experiments .",
    "what is not contained within this study is a proper investigation on the linearity of these effects .",
    "the induced current density given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : currentdensity ] ) depends linearly on the microwave magnetic field . at some point however",
    ", the magnitude of induced currents will be limited by the conductivity and thickness of the nm film .",
    "this will limit the mw fields produced by eddy currents , and will thus introduce a threshold for when eddy - current effects will affect the system .    developing a more detailed theoretical model involving a numerical solution of the coupled maxwells and llg equation would also be beneficial . a numerical model",
    "would enable the investigation of the interplay between applied and induced mw fields for various sample geometries .",
    "this is however outside the scope of our current work .    for applications , combining the effects of eddy currents",
    "could be used for canceling of mw fields in different geometries , and providing highly localized fields due to the localization of the eddy currents .",
    "this allows for generating and controlling the mw field in small regions . in more complicated geometries ,",
    "as often found in devices , the findings points towards that care should be taken in design , and that eddy - current effects can yield both fmr lineshape changes , unwanted or wanted screening / amplification of the local mw field , as well as the fmr excitation of spin waves with non - zero wave vectors .",
    "however , rather than treating eddy currents as a parasitic effect , our results suggest the possibility of actively using eddy currents to control the mw field excitation in thin film structures , which could be of importance for magnonics applications .",
