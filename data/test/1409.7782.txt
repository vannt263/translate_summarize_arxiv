    "characterization of an isolated spectral line measured under high resolution requires three pieces of information : the transition frequency , the transition integrated intensity , and the parameters that describe the line profile . a previous iupac task group ( hereafter called tg1 ) ,",
    "comprising several of the current authors , has critically evaluated the line frequency data available for all the major isotopologues of water @xcite .",
    "a summary of this work along with recommendations of tg1 were recently presented in this journal @xcite .",
    "the full characterization of the high - resolution spectrum of water vapour from the microwave to the ultraviolet is a prerequisite for modelling and understanding of various processes in many fields in chemistry , physics , earth sciences and engineering .",
    "the diverse areas of interest include :    1 .",
    "atmospheric modelling , with emphasis on the definitive understanding of global warming as water vapour is responsible for about 70 %  of the known absorption of sunlight and the majority of the greenhouse effect ; 2 .   atmospheric remote sensing and environmental monitoring , since it is generally necessary to remove the spectral signature of water in order to interpret correctly the signatures from trace species ; 3 .",
    "satellite communication , as the performance of satellites in the earth s atmosphere is sensitive to water absorption between about 3 and 400 ghz ; 4 .",
    "active remote sensing such as radar and lidar that is affected by water vapour attenuation ; 5 .",
    "studies of planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres ; 6 .",
    "astronomy , for example , that of cool stars , where hot water is a major constituent ; water lasers and masers , which are widespread in outer space , and the study of comets based on fluorescence spectroscopy ; 7 .",
    "combustion research , such as rocket exhausts , forest fires , and turbine engines , as hot steam is a major product of most combustion processes .",
    "one of the recommendations of tg1 was the urgent need to identify and adopt a reference line profile for high - resolution spectroscopic studies which improved upon the current standard , the so - called voigt profile ( vp ) .",
    "the present paper reports the related recommendation of another iupac task group ( hereafter called tg2 ) on `` intensities and line shapes in high - resolution spectra of water isotopologues from experiment and theory '' ( project no .",
    "2011 - 022 - 2 - 100 ) .",
    "tg2 limited itself to considering gas - phase transitions which occur in neutral environments as the pressure effects in plasmas need a somewhat different treatment .",
    "the line profile of an isolated spectroscopic transition is usually defined as being normalized to unit area and can be attributed to the following three physical factors :    1 .   the heisenberg time - energy uncertainty principle , or , equivalently , the spontaneous emission of radiation , is responsible for the natural lifetime broadening or _ intrinsic line width_. this component of the overall line shape",
    "is described by a lorentzian profile which is , however , sufficiently narrow to be safely neglected in favour of the next two contributions in all but the most specialized situations and ultra - low temperatures ; 2 .",
    "the thermal translational motion of the spectroscopically active molecule at velocity @xmath0 gives the incident radiation , of frequency @xmath1 , a frequency shift of @xmath2 = @xmath3 in the molecular frame of reference : the well - known _ doppler effect_. the corresponding doppler profile ( dp ) is expressed in terms of the doppler half - width , @xmath4 , by a gaussian function : @xmath5 for temperature @xmath6 , in k , and molecular mass @xmath7 , in kg , the doppler half - width , in hz , is @xmath8 or equivalently in terms of the molar mass , @xmath9 in g mol@xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "individual collisions of molecules lead to energy exchanges between radiators and perturbers .",
    "these exchanges shorten the lifetime of the initial and final states of the optical transition and yield what is called pressure or _",
    "collisional broadening_. these collisions also induce pressure - dependent shifts in the central frequency of the transition . assuming the independence of the pressure - broadened line half - width at half - maximum , @xmath12 , and of the pressure - induced line shift , @xmath13 , from the molecular speeds ( mean thermal velocity approximation ) , one obtains , for the associated profile , a homogeneous lorentzian function : @xmath14    at low pressures the doppler effect dominates , and as the pressure increases the effects of collisions become increasingly important . as a first approximation to get the resulting line shape ,",
    "the convolution of an inhomogeneous doppler profile with a homogeneous lorentzian profile is commonly used .",
    "it defines the so - called vp , which contains doppler and lorentzian shapes as limiting cases .",
    "the three parameters , @xmath4 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , characterizing the voigt profile are routinely employed in standard spectroscopic information systems @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 is independent of the gas mixture composition and has a known temperature dependence , see eq .",
    "2 . for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , their values in a mixture",
    "are simply obtained , assuming binary collisions , through model fraction - weighted average of the individual values for each collision partner .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath12 and @xmath13 is commonly assumed to be a power law for the broadening @xcite but remains to be found for the pressure shift .",
    "although the voigt profile involves an integral that can not be evaluated analytically , there are readily available , fast computational procedures for doing this , see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite , which make this function suitable for use in complex radiative - transfer codes .    there is now a widespread recognition that the vp does not give a fully accurate representation of the spectral line shape @xcite and its use can lead , for example , to a systematic underestimation of experimental line intensities @xcite .",
    "use of the vp for modelling spectra of water vapour recorded in both the laboratory and the atmosphere under high resolution leads to characteristic w - shaped residuals in any high - precision fit to the line absorption coefficient .",
    "see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite for laboratory work and refs .",
    "@xcite for atmospheric studies .",
    "in particular , large w - shaped residuals were observed in the analysis of h@xmath15o lines from the atmospheric chemistry experiment  @xcite , an effect that appears to occur only for h@xmath15o and not for other molecules in the spectra .",
    "deviations from the voigt line shape contribute to the large residuals for h@xmath15o lines , although there are likely other contributions relating to the high variability of the h@xmath15o column in the earth s atmosphere and the rapid change of h@xmath15o volume mixing ratio as a function of altitude in the troposphere , particularly in the tropics .",
    "the w - shaped residuals arise , and their amplitude may reach 10  %  of the peak absorption @xcite , as the observed lines are typically higher and narrower than predicted by the vp .",
    "deviations from the vp are generally ascribed to the effect of velocity changes ( vcs ) due to collisions , which reduce @xmath4 , and/or to the speed dependence ( sd ) of the relaxation rates , which corrects the simple lorentzian shape for different velocity - classes of active molecules .",
    "inclusion of these velocity effects in line - profile models has led to the development of a variety of possible line shape functions which can be characterized by their increasingly sophisticated representation of the underlying physics and an increasing number of parameters .",
    "several of these models are briefly considered in section iii .",
    "there are many suggested models for the line profile which move beyond the vp @xcite ; see chapter iii of the book by hartmann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for a more general discussion .",
    "these profiles are more sophisticated in that they include more physical effects than are accounted for by the vp and , as a consequence , require additional model parameters . at present , databases and most major radiative - transfer codes use voigt profiles , despite their well - documented deficiencies .",
    "the implementation of profiles beyond the voigt approximation in databases and codes represents a major task and will only be undertaken once there is some reasonable consensus as to which line profile to use .",
    "this has become particularly timely as increased sensitivity of remote sounding instruments and better knowledge of geophysical parameters has increased the relative significance of line - profile issues for observing systems .",
    "the aim of tg2 and of this article is therefore to recommend the use of a single functional form suitable for line profiles representing high - resolution spectroscopic transitions .    to achieve this goal the following points need to be considered :    1 .",
    "what single functional form from those available is most appropriate to replace the vp ?",
    "the chosen function should have a sound theoretical basis and behave in an appropriate manner as a function of pressure and temperature .",
    "2 .   is the chosen functional form computationally tractable ?",
    "radiative - transfer models which perform line - by - line calculations for large numbers of lines demand a functional form that can be evaluated reliably and efficiently .",
    "3 .   what are the consequences of replacing voigt functions in databases and models ? there should be a straightforward path from the current situation which relies on voigt functions to the newly recommended function .    to answer these questions",
    ", the water molecule serves as a suitable benchmark . as detailed in the introduction ,",
    "water line profiles are of great importance for a number of applications .",
    "furthermore , water has a large permanent dipole moment which leads to strong long - range interactions , making the line shape of its transitions particularly challenging to model from the purely theoretical point of view .",
    "tg2 therefore aimed to make a recommendation for water which would also be appropriate and adopted for other molecules .",
    "finally , we note that collision - induced mixing of nearby lines also alters line profiles , see chapter iv of ref .",
    "@xcite for a general discussion of this process .",
    "this effect has been observed in water transitions @xcite but was not explicitly considered by tg2 .",
    "nevertheless , the significance of the tg recommendations for the inclusion of line mixing and for the water continuum is discussed below .",
    ".summary of line - profile models considered .",
    "@xmath16 is the number of parameters required to characterize the line shape for a single isolated transition at a given temperature for a given pair of molecules .",
    "see text for further details and citations .",
    "all profiles except the simple lorentz profile include the doppler broadening effect . + [ cols=\"<,<,^,<,^ , < , < , < \" , ]     0.1 cm @xmath17 using the quadratic approximation of eq .  [ eqn_qsd ] for the speed dependence .",
    "the physics underlying the 7-parameter htp profile is as follows .",
    "the speed - dependences of the relaxation rates are represented by four parameters : two , ( @xmath18,@xmath19 ) , to represent the line broadening and two , ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , to represent the line shift . @xmath18 and @xmath20 are the mean relaxation rates , while @xmath19 and @xmath21 are the quadratic terms describing the speed dependence of relaxation @xcite , see eq",
    ".  [ eqn_qsd ] .",
    "velocity changes are represented within the nelkin  ghatak hard collision model , which requires a single parameter , @xmath22 .",
    "finally , parameter @xmath23 represents the partial correlation between velocity and rotational state changes due to collisions .",
    "the assumptions of quadratic speed dependences and hard collisions are approximations but , as illustrated below , some of the errors introduced by these approximations are actually compensated for by the inherent flexibility of the parameter fits .",
    "this model has been extensively tested both for water transitions and for those of other molecules @xcite using accurate calculated spectral shapes @xcite .    as discussed in the literature @xcite",
    ", there are a number of advantages the htp model offers .",
    "the first is that @xmath24 can be expressed in terms of two ( complex ) voigt ( or complex probability ) functions , see @xmath25 as given in eq .",
    "[ eq : w ] .",
    "@xcite provide a routine for evaluating the htp built on the voigt routine of humlicek @xcite .",
    "numerical tests have shown that the relative accuracy of this routine is always better than @xmath26 and that the computer time requirement is at most only five times that required for the computation of a vp .",
    "secondly , in the case where not all the parameters have been or can be determined , htp reduces in a very straightforward fashion to a number of simpler , standard profiles .",
    "these limiting cases are listed in table  [ tab : limits ] . in particular , given that the present databases are largely populated with parameters for the vp , it is advantageous that the htp reduces to the vp if all the high - order correction terms are set to zero .",
    "this is an extremely useful property , but one note of caution is in order . the parameters used to determine these profiles are not independent ; this means that once beyond - voigt parameters are introduced into the fit it is no longer possible to use the parameters to give a correct vp .",
    "third , we should mention the van vleck ",
    "weisskopf ( vvw ) line shape function @xcite , see page 184 of bernath @xcite for a short discussion .",
    "this simple form includes an anti - resonant lorentzian function .",
    "it is used for low frequency microwave work @xcite and in all models of mm - submm radiation propagation @xcite . by analogy with the vvw profile , the anti - resonant contribution , which is only significant at very long wavelengths ,",
    "could be taken into account using an htp after changing the signs of the transition frequency and the pressure shift .",
    "finally , line - mixing can be easily included in the model provided that two approximations are made @xcite .",
    "the first is the use of the so - called ( rosenkranz ) first - order approximation @xcite .",
    "the second is the neglect of the speed - dependence of the line - mixing .",
    "these approximations are routinely used in practical treatment of line - mixing , for example the implementation in the hitran database @xcite .",
    "the recommendation by the tg of the htp as the new standard for representing the profile of high - resolution spectroscopic transitions raises a number of issues which should be considered .",
    "first , use of this more complex parameterization to characterize the pressure line shape has a consequence not mentioned so far : collisional parameters for gas mixtures are no longer simple linear combinations of the parameters for the various active molecule - perturber pairs @xcite .",
    "this means that , for example , in the terrestrial atmosphere , it will be necessary for databases to separately specify collisional parameters for perturbations by n@xmath15 and o@xmath15 rather than just for `` air '' so that separate profiles can be computed and then added . as a result of this",
    "it will become necessary for all significant perturbers to be added individually to the databases .",
    "second , the discussion above has not addressed the temperature dependence of parameters in the line - profile models considered . even for studies of the earth",
    "s atmosphere it is necessary to consider line profiles in the temperature range of approximately @xmath27 to @xmath28  k. much larger temperature ranges are required for other modelling studies .",
    "for example , water line profiles are required for the atmosphere of hot jupiter exoplanets ( @xmath29 1000  1500 k ) @xcite and probably also for brown dwarfs ( @xmath30 k ) .",
    "available experimental studies usually span ranges of about 100 k to about room temperature , see refs .",
    "@xcite for example .",
    "obviously , it would be desirable to have experimental studies over more extended temperature ranges , but these are unlikely to be forthcoming in the immediate future .",
    "conversely , _ ab initio _",
    "spectral shapes calculated by molecular dynamics simulations @xcite should be reliable at temperatures above the quantum limit and can easily be repeated for many temperatures .",
    "so far such studies on water seem to have focused heavily on the room temperature regime @xcite .",
    "extending molecular dynamics simulations to probe the effects of temperature would clearly be very useful . in the absence of experimental determinations",
    ", this would allow predictions of the temperature dependence of the narrowing and correlation parameters .",
    "we expect the latter to be reliable , in view of the quality of calculations at room temperature .",
    "furthermore , the temperature dependences of @xmath19 and @xmath21 , like @xmath12 and @xmath13 , can be investigated by using semi - classical calculations @xcite .",
    "third , other tests , both experimental and numerical , would also be useful .",
    "issues that should be probed include : ( a ) signal - to - noise limits that the htp ( and other profiles ) are reliable for ; ( b ) tests of extreme heavy ",
    "light collisions such as water perturbed by he ( or h@xmath15 ) , such collisions are normally considered to be `` soft '' ; ( c ) tests of extreme light  heavy collisions such as water with xe or sf@xmath31 ; and ( d ) tests of whether collisions with open - shell systems , such as o@xmath15 , introduce any new features .    @xmath32o absorption feature at 7222.298050 cm@xmath10 measured at a pressure of 2.70 torr and a temperature of 273.16  k. residuals are given in terms of units of the original signal : root mean square ( rms ) values of about 150 @xmath34v simply reflect the noise in the original experiment @xcite .",
    "note that pcqsdngp is equivalent to htp.,height=491 ]    finally , the htp is based on an approximate quadratic treatment of the speed dependence and of velocity changes .",
    "the approximate treatment of sd can be tested against the more physically - based and more complicated pchsdngp , which uses the hypergeometric sd , albeit still with an approximate treatment of the potential .",
    "such tests have recently been completed by de vizia _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , see fig .",
    "they found that the htp and pchsdngp fitted their benchmark , measured , high - precision water line profiles almost equally well .",
    "furthermore , they found that the retrieved broadening and shifting parameters were unchanged in the two fits , something not completely found , for example , when using the sdgp ( speed - dependent galatry profile ) to fit the same data @xcite .",
    "however , values for the parameter @xmath22 , which can be related to the diffusion coefficient of the molecule in the perturbing medium , were found to be physically meaningful for the pchsdngp fits but not the htp ones @xcite . under these circumstances",
    "@xmath22 must just be regarded as a useful fit parameter , and nothing more . from fig .  1",
    ", one can see that the residual of the fit with the vp varies between about @xmath35  %  of the peak absorption .",
    "these data are for a specific line and pressure , but much larger effects are observed @xcite for other transitions and gas densities .",
    "the iupac task group formed by the first 12 authors of this paper makes the recommendation that the partially correlated quadratic - speed - dependent hard - collision profile @xcite should be adopted as the appropriate line - profile model of high - resolution spectroscopy moving beyond the vp . for simplicity",
    "we propose calling this the hartmann ",
    "tran profile ( htp ) .",
    "the proposed line shape is based on six temperature - dependent , collisional parameters for each line and perturber plus the doppler width , @xmath4 , fixed to its theoretical value .",
    "these parameters give the model the flexibility to include all the major `` non - voigt '' effects .",
    "htp involves parameters with known pressure dependences that can be stored in databases .",
    "htp has been demonstrated to lead to an accurate description ( 0.1 %  or better ) of the line shapes for a number of combinations of absorbers and perturbers @xcite , with the exception of h@xmath15 , which is a known difficult case . furthermore , htp can be computed accurately using only moderate computer time requirement @xcite , it is compatible with current implementations of line mixing , and it can be initially parameterized using the voigt parameters already available in standard data compilations .    considering the relatively large number of parameters required for the full htp model and the correlations between them ,",
    "fitting measured individual spectra is unlikely to yield a well - constrained parameter set .",
    "this means that a multispectrum procedure @xcite must be used .",
    "furthermore , to remove the partial correlations between the various parameters , it is essential to use spectra recorded in a broad pressure range and with a high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "there are some open questions about the use of the htp .",
    "the most pressing of these concerns the temperature dependence of the model parameters . these have not been the subject of serious testing over extended",
    "temperature ranges with temperature - dependent data from either laboratory measurements or numerical ( molecular dynamics and semi - classical ) simulations .",
    "furthermore , very high signal - to - noise ratio measurements , combined with multispectrum fits of data recorded at a number of pressures , would help to better define the underlying accuracy of the model .",
    "finally , tests need to be performed with a variety of collision partners to determine , for example , the effects of different mass ratios and collisions with open - shell species such as o@xmath15 .    one issue not discussed so far is that of the so - called water continuum @xcite .",
    "the water vapour continuum is characterised by absorption that varies smoothly with wavelength , from the visible to the microwave .",
    "it is present within the rotational and vibrational - rotational bands of water vapour , and in the many windows  between these bands .",
    "the precise relationship between the water continuum with the far wings of the line profile for individual transitions and with dimer contributions remains a matter for discussion .",
    "it is clear that changing the model for the line profile about the line center has possible consequences on the determination of the continuum .",
    "however , these should be small as local line contributions are only calculated in a narrow interval before subtraction from the measured absorption . changing the line shape thus has only a local effect with minor consequences on the broad and slowly varying continuum .",
    "furthermore , the main uncertainties in the continuum determination remain more to do with uncertainties in the line intensity and broadening coefficients than the line profile .",
    "nevertheless , for consistency , a continuum should be used in radiative transfer calculations which has the same local line shape as the one used in its experimental determination .",
    "finally , we note that adoption of the htp will require significant alteration to the data structures used in databases .",
    "work in this direction has already started @xcite . although tg2 was set up explicitly to consider water , our recommendations and the modernizations should apply to the line shape used for all molecular species .",
