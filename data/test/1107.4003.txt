    "a hundred years and more of fundamental research in atomic and nuclear physics has shown that all matter is corpuscular , with the atoms that comprise us , themselves containing a dense nuclear core .",
    "this core is composed of protons and neutrons , referred to collectively as nucleons , which are members of a broader class of femtometre - scale particles , called hadrons . in working toward an understanding of hadrons",
    ", we have discovered that they are complicated bound - states of quarks and gluons .",
    "these quarks and gluons are elementary , pointlike excitations , whose interactions are described by a poincar invariant quantum non - abelian gauge field theory ; namely , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the goal of hadron physics is the provision of a quantitative explanation of the properties of hadrons through a solution of qcd .",
    "quantum chromodynamics is the strong - interaction part of the standard model of particle physics and solving qcd presents a fundamental problem that is unique in the history of science .",
    "never before have we been confronted by a theory whose elementary excitations are not those degrees - of - freedom readily accessible via experiment ; i.e. , whose elementary excitations are _",
    "confined_. moreover , there are numerous reasons to believe that qcd generates forces which are so strong that less - than 2% of a nucleon s mass can be attributed to the so - called current - quark masses that appear in qcd s lagrangian ; viz .",
    ", forces capable of generating mass from nothing , a phenomenon known as dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) .",
    "neither confinement nor dcsb is apparent in qcd s lagrangian and yet they play the dominant role in determining the observable characteristics of real - world qcd .",
    "the physics of hadrons is ruled by _",
    "emergent phenomena _ such as these , which can only be elucidated through the use of nonperturbative methods in quantum field theory .",
    "this is both the greatest novelty and the greatest challenge within the standard model .",
    "we must find essentially new ways and means to explain precisely via mathematics the observable content of qcd .",
    "the complex of dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) is a powerful tool , which has been employed with marked success to study confinement and dcsb , and their impact on hadron observables .",
    "this will be emphasised and exemplified in this concise review , which describes selected recent progress in the study of mesons .",
    "it complements and extends earlier and other efforts @xcite .",
    "the basic problem of hadron physics is to solve qcd .",
    "this inspiring goal will only be achieved through a joint effort from experiment and theory because it is the feedback between them that leads most rapidly to improvements in understanding .",
    "the hadron physics community now has a range of major facilities that are accumulating data , of unprecedented accuracy and precision , which pose important challenges for theory .",
    "the opportunities for researchers in hadron physics promise to expand with the use of extant accelerators , and upgraded and new machines and detectors that will appear on a five - to - ten - year time - scale , in china , germany , japan , switzerland and the usa . a short list of facilities",
    "may readily be compiled : beijing s electron - positron collider ; in germany  cosy ( jlich cooler synchrotron ) , elsa ( bonn electron stretcher and accelerator ) , mami ( mainz microtron ) , and fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research ) under construction near darmstadt ; in japan  j - parc ( japan proton accelerator research complex ) under construction in tokai - mura , 150 km ne of tokyo , and kek , tsukuba ; in switzerland , the alice and compass detectors at cern ; and in the usa , both the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) , currently being upgraded , with new generation experiments expected in 2016 , and rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "asymptotic coloured states have not been observed , but is it a cardinal fact that they can not ?",
    "no solution to qcd will be complete if it does not explain confinement .",
    "this means confinement in the real world , which contains quarks with light current - quark masses .",
    "this is distinct from the artificial universe of pure - gauge qcd without dynamical quarks , studies of which tend merely to focus on achieving an area law for a wilson loop and hence are irrelevant to the question of light - quark confinement .    in stepping toward an answer to the question of confinement",
    ", it will likely be necessary to map out the long - range behaviour of the interaction between light - quarks ; namely , qcd s @xmath4-function at infrared momenta . in this connection",
    "it is noteworthy that the spectrum of meson and baryon excited states , and hadron elastic and transition form factors provide unique information about the long - range interaction between light - quarks and , in addition , the distribution of a hadron s characterising properties  such as mass and momentum , linear and angular  amongst its qcd constituents .",
    "the upgraded and promised future facilities will provide data that should guide the charting process .",
    "however , to make full use of that data , it will be necessary to have poincar covariant theoretical tools that enable the reliable study of hadrons in the mass range @xmath5-@xmath6gev .",
    "crucially , on this domain both confinement and dcsb are germane .",
    "it is known that dcsb ; namely , the generation of mass _ from nothing _",
    ", does take place in qcd .",
    "it arises primarily because a dense cloud of gluons comes to clothe a low - momentum quark @xcite .",
    "this is readily seen by solving the dse for the dressed - quark propagator ; i.e. , the gap equation , which yields the result illustrated in fig.[gluoncloud ] .",
    "( in our euclidean metric : @xmath7 ; @xmath8 ; @xmath9 , tr@xmath10=-4 \\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}$ ] ; @xmath11 $ ] ; @xmath12 ; and @xmath13 timelike @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "more information is available in app.a of ref.@xcite . )",
    "however , the origin of the interaction strength at infrared momenta , which guarantees dcsb through the gap equation , is currently unknown . this relationship ties confinement to dcsb .",
    "the reality of dcsb means the higgs mechanism is largely irrelevant to the bulk of normal matter in the universe .",
    "instead the most important mass generating mechanism for light - quark hadrons is the strong interaction effect of dcsb ; e.g. , one may identify it as being responsible for 98% of a proton s mass @xcite .",
    "there is a caveat ; namely , as so often , the pion is exceptional . its mass is given by the simple product of two terms , one of which is the ratio of two order parameters for dcsb whilst the other is determined by the current - quark mass ( sec.[psmassformula ] ) .",
    "hence the pion would be massless in the absence of a mechanism that can generate a current - mass for at least one light - quark .",
    "the impact of a massless , strongly - interacting particle on the physics of the universe would be dramatic",
    ".     dressed - quark mass function , @xmath16 in eq.([sgeneraln ] ) : _ solid curves _  dse results , explained in @xcite , `` data ''  numerical simulations of lattice - qcd @xcite .",
    "( nb .  @xmath17mev is the uppermost curve and current - quark mass decreases from top to bottom . )",
    "one observes the current - quark of perturbative qcd evolving into a constituent - quark as its momentum becomes smaller .",
    "the constituent - quark mass arises from a cloud of low - momentum gluons attaching themselves to the current - quark .",
    "this is dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) : an essentially nonperturbative effect that generates a quark mass _ from nothing _ ; namely , it occurs even in the chiral limit .",
    "( figure adapted from ref.@xcite.),scaledwidth=66.0% ]    it is natural to ask whether the connection between confinement and dcsb is accidental or causal .",
    "there are models with dcsb but not confinement , however , a model with confinement but lacking dcsb has not yet been identified ( see , e.g. , secs.2.1 and 2.2 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this leads to a conjecture that dcsb is a necessary consequence of confinement .",
    "it is interesting that there are numerous models and theories which exhibit both confinement and dcsb , and possess an external control parameter such that deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration occur simultaneously at some critical value of this parameter ; e.g. , quantum electrodynamics in three dimensions with @xmath18 electrons @xcite , and models of qcd at nonzero temperature and chemical potential @xcite .",
    "whether this simultaneity is a property possessed by qcd , and/or some broader class of theories , in response to changes in : the number of light - quark flavours ; temperature ; or chemical potential , is a longstanding question .",
    "the momentum - dependence of the quark mass , illustrated in fig.[gluoncloud ] , is an essentially quantum field theoretic effect , unrealisable in quantum mechanics , and a fundamental feature of qcd .",
    "this single curve connects the infrared and ultraviolet regimes of the theory , and establishes that the constituent - quark and current - quark masses are simply two connected points separated by a large momentum interval .",
    "the curve shows that qcd s dressed - quark behaves as a constituent - quark , a current - quark , or something in between , depending on the momentum of the probe which explores the bound - state containing the dressed - quark .",
    "it follows that calculations addressing momentum transfers @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the mass of the hadron involved , require a poincar - covariant approach that can veraciously realise quantum field theoretical effects @xcite .",
    "owing to the vector - exchange character of qcd , covariance also guarantees the existence of nonzero quark orbital angular momentum in a hadron s rest - frame @xcite .",
    "the dressed - quark mass function has a remarkable capacity to correlate and to contribute significantly in explaining a wide range of diverse phenomena .",
    "this brings urgency to the need to understand the relationship between parton properties in the light - front frame , whose peculiar properties simplify some theoretical analyses , and the structure of hadrons as measured in the rest frame or other smoothly related frames .",
    "this is a problem because , e.g. , dcsb , an established keystone of low - energy qcd , has not explicitly been realised in the light - front formulation .",
    "the obstacle is the constraint @xmath21 for massive quanta on the light front @xcite .",
    "it is therefore impossible to make zero momentum fock states that contain particles and hence the vacuum is `` trivial '' . on the other hand ,",
    "it is conceivable that dcsb is inextricably tied with the formation and structure of goldstone modes and not otherwise a measurable property of the vacuum .",
    "this conjecture is being explored @xcite and is something about which more will be written herein ( sec.[inhadroncondensate ] ) .",
    "in addition , parton distribution functions , which have a probability interpretation in the infinite momentum frame , must be calculated in order to comprehend their content : parametrisation is insufficient",
    ". it would be very interesting to know , e.g. , how , if at all , the distribution functions of a goldstone mode differ from those of other hadrons @xcite .",
    "it is worth stating plainly that the potential between infinitely - heavy quarks measured in numerical simulations of quenched lattice - regularised qcd  the so - called static potential  is simply _ irrelevant _ to the question of confinement in the real world , in which light quarks are ubiquitous .",
    "in fact , it is a basic feature of qcd that light - particle creation and annihilation effects are essentially nonperturbative and therefore it is impossible in principle to compute a potential between two light quarks @xcite .",
    "drawing on a long list of sources ; e.g. , refs.@xcite , a perspective on confinement was laid out in ref.@xcite .",
    "confinement can be related to the analytic properties of qcd s schwinger functions , which are often called euclidean - space green functions .",
    "for example , it can be read from the reconstruction theorem @xcite that the only schwinger functions which can be associated with expectation values in the hilbert space of observables ; namely , the set of measurable expectation values , are those that satisfy the axiom of reflection positivity .",
    "this is an extremely tight constraint .",
    "it can be shown to require as a necessary condition that the fourier transform of the momentum - space schwinger function is a positive - definite function of its arguments .",
    "this condition suggests a practical confinement test , which can be used with numerical solutions of the dses ( see , e.g. , sec.iii.c of ref.@xcite and sec.iv of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the implications and use of reflection positivity are discussed and illustrated in sec .  2 of ref.@xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that any 2-point schwinger function with an inflexion point at @xmath22 must breach the axiom of reflection positivity , so that a violation of positivity can be determined by inspection of the pointwise behaviour of the schwinger function in momentum space ( sec.iv.b of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "consider then @xmath23 , which is the single scalar function that describes the dressing of a landau - gauge gluon propagator . a large body of work has focused on exposing the behaviour of @xmath23 in the pure yang - mills sector of qcd .",
    "these studies are reviewed in ref.@xcite .",
    "a connection with the expression and nature of confinement in the yang - mills sector is indicated in fig.[fig : gluonrp ] .",
    "the appearance of an inflexion point in the two - point function generated by the gluon s momentum - dependent mass - function is impossible to overlook .",
    "hence this gluon can not appear in the hilbert space of observable states .",
    "the inflexion point possessed by @xmath24 , visible in fig.[gluoncloud ] , conveys the same properties on the dressed - quark propagator .",
    "numerical simulations of lattice - qcd confirm the appearance of an inflexion point in both the dressed - gluon and -quark propagators ; e.g. , see fig.[gluoncloud ] and ref.@xcite .",
    "the signal is clearest for the gluon owing to the greater simplicity of simulations in the pure yang - mills sector @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that this sense of confinement is essentially quantum field theoretical in nature . amongst its many consequences",
    "is that confinement in qcd can not veraciously be represented in potential models .",
    "@xmath23 , the function that describes dressing of a landau - gauge gluon propagator , plotted for three distinct cases .",
    "a bare gluon is described by @xmath25 ( the dashed line ) , which is plainly convex on @xmath26 .",
    "such a propagator has a representation in terms of a non - negative spectral density . in some theories ,",
    "interactions generate a mass in the transverse part of the gauge - boson propagator , so that @xmath27 , which can also be represented in terms of a non - negative spectral density .",
    "in qcd , however , self - interactions generate a momentum - dependent mass for the gluon , which is large at infrared momenta but vanishes in the ultraviolet @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated by the curve labelled `` ir - massive but uv - massless . '' with the generation of a mass-_function _ , @xmath23 exhibits an inflexion point and hence can not be expressed in terms of a non - negative spectral density .",
    ", scaledwidth=67.0% ]    from the perspective that confinement can be related to the analytic properties of qcd s schwinger functions , the question of light - quark confinement can be translated into the challenge of charting the infrared behavior of qcd s _ universal _ @xmath4-function . ( although this function may depend on the scheme chosen to renormalise the theory , it is unique within a given scheme @xcite .",
    "of course , the behaviour of the @xmath4-function on the perturbative domain is well known . )",
    "this is a well - posed problem whose solution is an elemental goal of modern hadron physics and which can be addressed in any framework enabling the nonperturbative evaluation of renormalisation constants .",
    "it is the @xmath4-function that is responsible for the behaviour evident in figs.[gluoncloud ] and [ fig : gluonrp ] , and one of the more interesting of contemporary questions is whether it is possible to reconstruct the @xmath4-function , or at least constrain it tightly , given empirical information on the gluon and quark mass functions .",
    "in order to proceed it is necessary to describe explicitly the best known and simplest dse .",
    "the dyson or gap equation describes how quark propagation is influenced by interactions ; viz .",
    ", for a quark of flavour @xmath28 , @xmath29 where : @xmath30 is the gluon propagator ; @xmath31 , the quark - gluon vertex ; @xmath32 , a symbol that represents a poincar invariant regularization of the four - dimensional euclidean integral , with @xmath33 the regularization mass - scale ; @xmath34 , the current - quark bare mass ; and @xmath35 , respectively , the vertex and quark wave function renormalisation constants , with @xmath36 the renormalisation point ",

    "the gap equation s solution is the dressed - quark propagator , @xmath37 which is obtained from eq.([gendsen ] ) augmented by a renormalisation condition .",
    "a mass - independent scheme is a useful choice and can be implemented by fixing all renormalisation constants in the chiral limit .",

    "the running coupling constant , this `` running mass '' is familiar from textbooks .",
    "however , it is not commonly appreciated that @xmath41 is simply the dressed - quark mass function evaluated at one particular deep spacelike point ; viz , @xmath42 the renormalisation - group invariant current - quark mass may be inferred via @xmath43^{\\gamma_m } m_f(p^2)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 : @xmath18 is the number of quark flavours employed in computing the running coupling ; and @xmath45 is qcd s dynamically - generated renormalisation - group - invariant mass - scale .",
    "the chiral limit is expressed by @xmath46 moreover , @xmath47 however , we would like to emphasise that in the presence of dcsb the ratio @xmath48 is not independent of @xmath49 : in the infrared ; i.e. , @xmath50 , it then expresses a ratio of constituent - like quark masses , which , for light quarks , are two orders - of - magnitude larger than their current - masses and nonlinearly related to them @xcite .",
    "the gap equation illustrates the features and flaws of each dse .",
    "it is a nonlinear integral equation for the dressed - quark propagator and hence can yield much - needed nonperturbative information .",
    "however , the kernel involves the two - point function @xmath30 and the three - point function @xmath31 .",
    "the gap equation is therefore coupled to the dses satisfied by these functions , which in turn involve higher @xmath51-point functions .",
    "hence the dses are a tower of coupled integral equations , with a tractable problem obtained only once a truncation scheme is specified .",
    "it is unsurprising that the best known truncation scheme is the weak coupling expansion , which reproduces every diagram in perturbation theory .",
    "this scheme is systematic and valuable in the analysis of large momentum transfer phenomena because qcd is asymptotically free but it precludes any possibility of obtaining nonperturbative information .",
    "given the importance of dcsb in qcd , it is significant that the dressed - quark propagator features in the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity , which expresses chiral symmetry and its breaking pattern : @xmath52 \\,\\gamma_5^{fg}(k;p ) = s_f^{-1}(k_+ ) i \\gamma_5 +   i \\gamma_5 s_g^{-1}(k_- ) \\ , , \\label{avwtimn}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the total - momentum entering the vertex and @xmath54 is the relative - momentum between the amputated quark legs . to be explicit , @xmath55 , with",

    "sec.[flavourless ] discusses the important differences encountered in treating flavourless pseudoscalar mesons . in eq.([avwtimn ] ) , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are , respectively , the amputated axial - vector and pseudoscalar vertices .",
    "they are both obtained from an inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) , which is exemplified here using a textbook expression @xcite : @xmath61_{tu } = z_2 [ \\gamma_5 \\gamma_\\mu]_{tu}+ \\int_q^\\lambda [ s(q_+ ) \\gamma_{5\\mu}(q;p ) s(q_- ) ] _ { sr } k_{tu}^{rs}(q , k;p ) , \\label{bsetextbook}\\ ] ] in which @xmath62 is the fully - amputated quark - antiquark scattering kernel , and the colour- , dirac- and flavour - matrix structure of the elements in the equation is denoted by the indices @xmath63 .",
    "nb .  by definition",
    ", @xmath62 does not contain quark - antiquark to single gauge - boson annihilation diagrams , nor diagrams that become disconnected by cutting one quark and one antiquark line .",
    "the ward - takahashi identity , eq.([avwtimn ] ) , entails that an intimate relation exists between the kernel in the gap equation and that in the bse .",
    "( this is another example of the coupling between dses . )",
    "therefore an understanding of chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking can only be obtained with a truncation scheme that preserves this relation , and hence guarantees eq.([avwtimn ] ) without a fine - tuning of model - dependent parameters .",
    "through the gap and bethe - salpeter equations the pointwise behaviour of the @xmath4-function determines the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking ; e.g. , the behaviour in fig.[gluoncloud ] .",
    "moreover , the fact that these and other dses connect the @xmath4-function to experimental observables entails that comparison between computations and observations of the hadron mass spectrum , and hadron elastic and transition form factors , can be used to constrain the @xmath4-function s long - range behaviour .    in order to realise this goal",
    ", a nonperturbative symmetry - preserving dse truncation is necessary .",
    "steady quantitative progress can be made with a scheme that is systematically improvable @xcite .",
    "in fact , the mere existence of such a scheme has enabled the proof of exact nonperturbative results in qcd .    before describing a number of these in some detail",
    ", it is worth explicating the range of applications .",
    "for example , there are : veracious statements about the pion @xmath64-term @xcite ; radially - excited and hybrid pseudoscalar mesons @xcite ; heavy - light @xcite and heavy - heavy mesons @xcite ; novel results for the pion susceptibility obtained via analysis of the isovector - pseudoscalar vacuum polarisation @xcite , which bear upon the essential content of the so - called `` mexican hat '' potential that is used in building models for qcd ; and a derivation @xcite of the weinberg sum rule @xcite .      turning now to a fuller illustration , the first of the results was introduced in ref.@xcite ; namely , a mass formula that is exact for flavour non - diagonal pseudoscalar mesons : @xmath65 where : @xmath66 are the current - masses of the quarks constituting the meson ; and @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the pseudoscalar meson s bound - state bethe - salpeter amplitude : @xmath69 , \\label{gengpi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is determined from the associated homogeneous bse .",
    "it is worth emphasising that the quark wavefunction and lagrangian mass renormalisation constants , @xmath70 , respectively , depend on the gauge parameter in precisely the manner needed to ensure that the right - hand sides of eqs.([fpigen ] ) , ( [ rhogen ] ) are gauge - invariant .",
    "moreover , @xmath71 ensures that the right - hand side of eq.([fpigen ] ) is independent of both @xmath36 and @xmath33 , so that @xmath72 is truly an observable ; and @xmath73 ensures that @xmath74 is independent of @xmath33 and evolves with @xmath36 in just the way necessary to guarantee that the product @xmath75 is renormalisation - point - independent .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that eq.([mrtrelation ] ) is valid for every pseudoscalar meson and for any value of the current - quark masses ; viz . , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "this includes arbitrarily large values and also the chiral limit , in whose neighbourhood eq.([mrtrelation ] ) can be shown @xcite to reproduce the familiar gell - mann  oakes  renner relation .",
    "the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity , eq.([avwtimn ] ) , is a crucial bridge to eqs.([mrtrelation ] )  ( [ rhogen ] ) ; and on the way one can also prove the following goldberger - treiman - like relations @xcite : @xmath78 wherein the superscript indicates that the associated quantity is evaluated in the chiral limit , and @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 are analogues in the inhomogeneous axial - vector vertex of the scalar functions in the @xmath82-meson s bethe - salpeter amplitude .",
    "these identities are of critical importance in qcd .",
    "the first , eq.([gtlrele ] ) , can be used to prove that a massless pseudoscalar meson appears in the chiral - limit spectrum if , and only if , chiral symmetry is dynamically broken .",
    "moreover , it exposes the fascinating consequence that the solution of the two - body pseudoscalar bound - state problem is almost completely known once the one - body problem is solved for the dressed - quark propagator , with the relative momentum within the bound - state identified unambiguously with the momentum of the dressed - quark .",
    "this latter emphasises that goldstone s theorem has a pointwise expression in qcd .",
    "the remaining three identities are also important because they show that a pseudoscalar meson _ must _ contain components of pseudovector origin .",
    "this result overturned a misapprehension of twenty - years standing ; namely , that only @xmath83 is nonzero @xcite .",

    "the decay constants of all other pseudoscalar mesons on this trajectory , e.g. , radial excitations , vanish . on the other hand , in the absence of dcsb the leptonic decay constant of each such pseudoscalar meson vanishes in the chiral limit ; i.e , eq.([fpin ] ) is true @xmath85 .",

    "the leptonic decay constant for @xmath91-wave states is typically proportional to the wave function at the origin .",
    "compared with the ground state , this is smaller for an excited state because the wave function is broader in configuration space and wave functions are normalised .",
    "however , it is a modest effect ; e.g. , consider the @xmath92 decay of vector mesons , for which a calculation in relativistic quantum mechanics based on light - front dynamics @xcite yields @xmath93 , consistent with the value inferred from experiment .",

    "it is now recognised that the suppression of @xmath95 is a useful benchmark , which can be used to tune and validate lattice qcd techniques that try to determine the properties of excited states mesons .      for the last thirty years , _ condensates _ ; i.e. , nonzero vacuum expectation values of local operators , have been used as parameters in order to correlate and estimate essentially nonperturbative strong - interaction matrix elements @xcite .",
    "they are also basic to current algebra analyses .",
    "it is conventionally held that such quark and gluon condensates have a physical existence , which is independent of the hadrons that express qcd s asymptotically realisable degrees - of - freedom ; namely , that these condensates are not merely mass - dimensioned parameters in a theoretical truncation scheme , but in fact describe measurable spacetime - independent configurations of qcd s elementary degrees - of - freedom in a hadronless ground state .",

    "it is therefore notable that one may rigorously define an `` in - meson '' condensate ; viz.@xcite : @xmath102 now , using eq.([gtlrele ] ) , one finds @xcite @xmath103 hence the so - called vacuum quark condensate is , in fact , the chiral - limit value of the in - meson condensate ; i.e. , it describes a property of the chiral - limit pseudoscalar meson .",

    "<S> we provide a brief review of recent progress in the study of mesons using qcd s dyson - schwinger equations . along the way we touch on aspects of confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking but in the main focus upon : exact results for pseudoscalar mesons , including aspects of the @xmath0-@xmath1 problem ; a realisation that the so - called vacuum condensates are actually an intrinsic , localised property of hadrons ; an essentially nonperturbative procedure for constructing a symmetry - preserving bethe - salpeter kernel , which has enabled a demonstration that dressed - quarks possess momentum - dependent anomalous chromo- and electromagnetic moments that are large at infrared momenta , and resolution of a longstanding problem in understanding the mass - splitting between @xmath2- and @xmath3-mesons such that they are now readily seen to be parity partners in the meson spectrum ; features of electromagnetic form factors connected with charged and neutral pions ; and computation and explanation of valence - quark distribution functions in pseudoscalar mesons . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that in solving qcd , a constructive feedback between theory and extant and forthcoming experiments will enable constraints to be placed on the infrared behaviour of qcd s @xmath4-function , the nonperturbative quantity at the core of hadron physics . </S>"
