    "the early universe was a highly uniform and homogeneous mix of dark and baryonic matter with baryon fraction @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "if this primordial mix persists as individual gravitationally bound structures emerge during the course of cosmic evolution , then the baryonic mass of any given object would be @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , combining this with the baryon density constraint from big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite provides one important argument that the density parameter is less than unity @xcite .",
    "here we reverse the logic and ask what fraction of the expected baryons are actually detected .",
    "we present an inventory of the baryonic and gravitating masses of cosmic structures spanning a dozen decades in detected baryonic mass .",
    "the mass of baryons known in each system correlates well with the total mass , but not as a simple proportion .",
    "the implication is that most of the baryons associated with individual dark matter halos are now missing .",
    "while some are in the intergalactic medium @xcite , a complete accounting of where the baryons now reside , and how they relate to their parent structures , remains wanting .",
    "we divide our inventory into two broad categories of gravitationally bound systems : those supported by rotation , and those supported by random motions .",
    "this distinction is important to the way in which we infer the gravitating mass , as discussed for each type of system below .",
    "the detected baryonic mass is the sum of observed stellar and gaseous components : @xmath4 .",
    "in general , the gas mass is more precisely known as the physics of the emission mechanism is better understood , while the stellar mass requires an estimate of the mass - to - light ratio of a composite stellar population in order to convert observed luminosity to mass . over the many decades in mass considered here , a factor of @xmath5 uncertainty in the the stellar mass - to - light ratio is a minor concern .",
    "one of the most important lines of evidence for dark matter is the observation that the rotation curves of spiral galaxies tend to become asymptotically flat @xcite at large radii where the baryonic mass alone should result in a keplerian decline .",
    "this outermost circular velocity , @xmath6 , we take to be representative of the gravitating mass . among rotating systems , we distinguish between those dominated by stellar mass ( typically early type spirals ) and those dominated by gas mass ( typically irregular and late type spirals ) .",
    "bright spiral galaxies have the majority of their detected baryonic mass in the form of stars .",
    "we utilize the rotation velocities and mass estimates of @xcite , selecting only those galaxies with @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "the results are in good agreement with independent work @xcite .",
    "the sum of baryonic mass is completed by adding the cold gas mass , corrected by a factor of 1.4 to account for the presence of helium and heavier elements .",
    "dust and hot gas do not contribute significantly to the total @xcite .",
    "many dim , late type disk galaxies have more of their baryonic mass in the form of atomic gas than in stars : @xmath9 .",
    "these are particularly interesting for our purposes here because their baryonic mass is insensitive to the choice of stellar mass estimator . for these galaxies , @xmath10 follows almost directly from the observed 21 cm flux and the physics of the hydrogen hyperfine transition .",
    "two recent independent studies @xcite provide for the first time a large combined sample of such galaxies .",
    "rotationally supported disk galaxies are known to obey a relation between baryonic mass and rotation velocity known as the baryonic tully - fisher relation @xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ mbv ] , giving emphasis to the gas dominated galaxies ( larger circles ) which extend the relation beyond that previously known for bright spirals .",
    "they also provide a physics - based calibration of the relation @xcite .",
    "this is shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "the intrinsic relation appears to be very tight @xcite , with observational uncertainty ( due mostly to the uncertainty in the distances to the individual galaxies ) accounting for essentially all of the scatter .    lccc dwarf & @xmath11 & 8.2 & @xmath123.88 + disk & 20  350 & 4.0 & @xmath131.65 + cluster & @xmath14 & 3.2 & @xmath133.69 [ broken ]    the baryonic tully - fisher relation for rotating disks shown in fig .",
    "[ mbv ] extends over five decades in baryonic mass , a considerable improvement over the two decades typically considered . before considering how the baryonic mass relates to the total mass",
    ", we first investigate whether this relation can be extended still further .",

    "it is also subject to degeneracy between stellar and dark mass . given these uncertainties , and that these data largely overlap with those for spirals , we do not consider giant ellipticals further .",
    "we do note that the estimates of @xcite and @xcite are consistent with our results to the same degree that they are consistent with each other .",
    "recent years have witnessed an explosion in the discovery of small satellite galaxies of both the milky way @xcite and m31 @xcite .",

    "the baryonic masses of these systems are dominated by stars . to convert light to mass",
    ", we adopt the mean stellar mass - to - light ratio estimated @xcite from resolved stellar population studies : @xmath18 .",
    "recent work @xcite on clusters provides a large , homogeneous set of data with stellar , gas , and gravitating masses averaged over many individual clusters .",
    "most of the baryonic mass in clusters is in hot , x - ray emitting gas .",
    "this provides a good measure of both the gas mass and the gravitating mass .",
    "stellar masses are based on a scaling relation @xcite derived from @xmath19-band data .",
    "the result here is not sensitive to the precise relation as the x - ray gas dominates the baryon budget .",
    "it is conventional to refer to structures by the density contrast they represent with respect to the critical density of the universe .",

    "to relate the circular velocity @xmath6 observed in spirals to @xmath26 at larger radii , we note that rotation curves are approximately flat , so we expect @xmath27 with @xmath28 . if we associate the observed @xmath6 with the peak velocity of an nfw halos @xcite , then @xmath29 over the relevant range of masses .",
    "this appears consistent with the milky way @xcite if @xmath30 , which we adopt for specificity .",
    "this is also consistent with the independent estimate of @xcite .",
    "note that a 20% change in @xmath31 corresponds to shifting the cluster data by the width of a data point in fig .",
    "[ mbv ] .",
    "the choice of the radius @xmath32 is driven by the data , and is inevitably somewhat arbitrary .",
    "a preferable choice might be the virial radius , which occurs around @xmath33 in @xmath34cdm   @xcite .",
    "the data do not constrain this , nor is there anything genuinely special about the virial radius as the halo profile is expected to merge smoothly with the cosmic background .",
    "so we reference our masses to @xmath32 , and caution that other plausible choices would give apparently conflicting results merely because of the differing convention .",
    "we also note that cluster baryon fractions tend to be rising at the last measured point , which might help to reconcile them with the cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "in contrast , choosing a larger ( e.g. , virial ) reference radius for individual galaxies would only include more dark mass without any additional baryons , driving their inferred baryon fractions to smaller values .",
    "[ mbv ] represents a generalization of the baryonic tully - fisher relation to pressure supported systems , and extension to higher and lower mass .",
    "the data can be described by a broken power law , with a different slope and normalization at the dwarf , disk galaxy , and cluster scale ( table  [ broken ] ) .",
    "the variation between these regimes is a small effect compared to the deviation from a constant baryon fraction ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ mbv ] ) .",
    "the gravitating mass scales as @xmath35 , but the observed relation is steeper at all scales . consequently , the detected baryon mass deviates systematically from the expectation of a constant cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "the data of @xcite represent the binning of many individual clusters , while the remaining data in fig .",
    "[ mbv ] represent individual galaxies . to place all data on the same footing",
    ", we also bin the galaxy data .",
    "we bin in intervals in baryonic mass containing roughly equal numbers of galaxies .",
    "we maintain the distinction between galaxies of different types , and for the gas dominated galaxies , we maintain separation between the data of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the binned data are reported in table  [ bindat ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fdfstv ] .",
    "table  [ bindat ] gives the mean and standard deviation in the mean of each logarithmic bin in circular velocity , baryonic mass , stellar mass , and gravitating mass within @xmath23 .",
    "it also gives the detected baryon fraction @xmath36 , which is the ratio of known baryons to the amount expected from the cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "the fraction of these nominally available baryons that have been converted into stars is given by the stellar fraction @xmath37 .",
    "the stellar fraction reaches a maximum between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fdfstv ] ) . this is broadly consistent with previous results based on counting statistics @xcite .",
    "however , there may be some offset in the peak mass scale relating to the long standing dichotomy between tully - fisher and luminosity function based normalizations of the halo mass function .",
    "notably , the efficiency of star formation appears to increase monotonically with mass for individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "after the transition to cluster halos containing many galaxies , the efficiency declines again .    perhaps the most striking aspect of fig .",
    "[ fdfstv ] is that the fraction of detected baryons falls short of the cosmic fraction at all scales . in no system",
    "is it unity , as would be expected if we had a complete accounting of all the baryons associated with a given bound system . where are all these missing baryons ?",
    "an obvious possibility is that the missing baryons are present , and simply inhabit their dark matter halos in some undetected form .",
    "indeed , one might expect that not all baryons would have time to cool into the observed cold gas and stellar component of galaxies . in this case",
    ", many baryons might remain mixed in with the dark halo .    the notion that we are simply not seeing many or even most of the baryons in individual galaxies is profoundly unsatisfactory .",
    "direct searches for hot halo gas have turned up nothing substantial : halo baryon reservoirs fail to explain the observed deficit by two orders of magnitude @xcite . in clusters ,",
    "the hot gas is detected , and constitutes the majority of the baryons .",
    "clusters fall short of the cosmic baryon fraction by a modest amount @xcite which might be readily explicable @xcite",
    ". however , the fraction of missing baryons is highly significant on the scales of individual galaxies . in dwarfs ,",
    "fewer than 1% of the baryons expected from the cosmic fraction are detected .",
    "the detected baryon fraction varies systematically with scale .",
    "it is a matter of taste whether one chooses to describe this scale as one of circular velocity , mass , or potential well depth .",
    "it is tempting to attribute this correlation to feedback processes being more effective in objects with smaller potential wells @xcite .",
    "however , the details are heinously complicated @xcite and not well understood .",
    "we would naively expect feedback to be a messy process resulting in lots of scatter in any correlations that might result .",
    "instead , the observed relation is remarkably tight . in principle , the entire range @xmath38 is accessible at each mass , yet only a very particular value is observed .",
    "moreover , the current potential well is the result of the hierarchical assembly of many smaller building blocks .",
    "left to itself , a small dark matter halo will have a small @xmath39 .",
