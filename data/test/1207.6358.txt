    "large - amplitude longitudinal ( lal ) oscillations in prominences were first reported by @xcite ; since then , only few additional reports of these motions have appeared @xcite .",
    "these oscillations produce motions along the magnetic field , have long periods of 50 - 160 minutes , and are damped in @xmath0-@xmath1 cycles , with high velocity amplitudes in the range @xmath2-@xmath3 .",
    "lal oscillations are apparently triggered by an energetic event : a sub - flare , a microflare , or a flare close to the filament .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the restoring force and damping mechanism of the lal oscillations ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but most do not successfully describe the thread motions .",
    "recently , we studied the oscillations of threads forming the basic components of a prominence @xcite in a 3d sheared arcade @xcite .",
    "we found that the restoring force is mainly the gravity and the pressure forces are small .",
    "this type of oscillation resembles the motion of a gravity - driven pendulum , where the frequency only depends on the solar gravity and the flux - tube dip curvature .",
    "we estimated the minimum value of the magnetic field at the tube dips and found agreement with previous estimates and observed values .",
    "additionally , this study revealed a new method for measuring the radius of curvature of the filament dips .",
    "@xcite observed and analyzed an oscillating prominence and found that the motion is produced along a dipped magnetic field , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "these studies reveal that the lal oscillations are strongly related to the filament - channel geometry .",
    "the filament - channel structure is not well understood and several models have been suggested . the sheared arcade and the flux rope models are the most successful candidates explaining most of the observational evidence ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "in these models the magnetic structure is static and independent of the prominence evolution because the plasma-@xmath4 is small , and the structure has dips where the cool prominence resides . due to the low plasma @xmath4 , however , most models agree that these dips are not caused by weight of the prominence .",
    "the prominence mass forms in the dipped part of the magnetic field because it is a gravity potential well where evaporated mass plasma condense and collect @xcite .",
    "there is also direct observational evidence from polarimetric inversions of the dipped magnetic structure of the filaments @xcite . in these models",
    "the curvature in the dips is large and the lal oscillations could be strongly influenced by these geometries .",
    "in contrast , where the magnetic field is slightly curved by the prominence weight , the curvature effects on the oscillations are negligible @xcite .    in our previous study of lal oscillations , we assumed the threads to be solid masses moving in curved flux - tubes without interaction with the surrounding hot plasma . in this work",
    "we use a full wave description of the oscillation , expanding our previous investigations .",
    "we focus on the restoring forces of the lal oscillations and the influence of the curvature of the filament magnetic fields in different tube geometries , and compare the resulting thread motions with observed lal oscillations properties .",
    "in this work we assume that the plasma is low-@xmath4 and confined with static magnetic field . in this regime",
    "the plasma motion is described with equations ( 1)-(4 ) of @xcite .",
    "we additionally consider that the system is adiabatic , with no heating and radiation , and the tubes have a uniform width .",
    "thus , the terms associated with the energy loss and gains , and the area expansion , can be neglected .",
    "we linearize this set of equations to obtain the equations for the perturbed quantities @xmath5 where the `` @xmath6 '' index means the equilibrium quantity that depends on the coordinate s , the `` @xmath7 '' index means the perturbed quantity , @xmath8 is the perturbed velocity ( a zero background velocity is considered ) , and @xmath9 is the gravity projected along the flux tube .",
    "additionally the plasma is in hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath10 combining equations ( [ linear - eq1])-([mechequil - eq ] ) we obtain the equation for the velocity perturbation @xmath11 + where @xmath12 .",
    "this equation is similar to equation ( 7.30 ) of @xcite assuming a displacement constrained along the flux tube .",
    "we model the filament flux - tube geometry as composed of up to 3 curved segments ( see fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) .",
    "these segments are contained in a vertical plane with the center of curvature located above or below the tube for a concave - up or concave - down segments respectively .",
    "each segment has a constant radius of curvature @xmath13 .",
    "the radius of curvature is positive for a concave - up segment and negative for a concave - down segment . with these considerations , on each segment of the tube equation ( [ wave - eq ] ) is @xmath14 where @xmath15 defining @xmath16 .",
    "assuming now that the radius of curvature @xmath13 is sufficiently large to fulfill the condition @xmath17 , the @xmath18 angle takes small values in all the positions of the tube . thus considering linear approximations of the sinusoidal functions ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) ,",
    "then @xmath21 this equation reduces to equation  ( 8) of @xcite for a low-@xmath4 plasma when curvature is negligible ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) .",
    "hence , for a straight tube the equation describing the perturbations is simply @xmath23    we consider solutions for which the time dependence is a simple harmonic oscillation with frequency @xmath24 and the velocity perturbation takes the form @xmath25 .",
    "thus equation ( [ motion - eq ] ) becomes @xmath26 this equation describes the oscillatory motion of a plasma embedded in a curved tube with constant curvature in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "solving equation ( [ wavegravity - eq ] ) is complicated because the sound velocity depends on the position along the tube , i.e. @xmath27 . however , if we assume that the segments of the tube are isothermal , the sound velocity is uniform on each segment , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "thus , we can perform a linear change of variable defined by @xmath29 and equation  [ wavegravity - eq ] becomes @xmath30    we consider that the plasma within the flux tubes of the filament is distributed in three isothermal regions .",
    "the thread consists of cool plasma centered at the dip with an uniform sound speed , @xmath31 .",
    "the remaining thermal regions are the hot coronal plasma filling the tube from both ends of the thread to the footpoints , with a uniform sound speed , @xmath32 . in this work",
    "we ignore the small transition region from the cool prominence thread to the coronal hot plasma ( the so - called pctr ) at both ends of the thread .",
    "this region is thin in comparison with the thread length , and the influence on the thread oscillations may be small , so we leave the incorporation of this region for a future study .",
    "we note that both the equilibrium density and pressure depend on @xmath33 , despite having a uniform sound speed along each flux - tube segment .",
    "in this situation the density and pressure decrease exponentially with height , at a rate given by the pressure scale height . for a typical hot coronal plasma",
    "the pressure scale height is a few tens of @xmath34 .",
    "however , for a typical prominence it is about @xmath35 . therefore the pressure and density are roughly uniform in the coronal parts of our low - lying flux tubes , whereas they vary rapidly along the curved thread .",
    "equation ( [ waveadim - eq ] ) governs the plasma motion on each part of the piecewise flux tube with uniform temperature and @xmath13 .",
    "this equation is a second - order ordinary equation with a irregular singular point at infinity , so its solution can be expressed as a combination of two regular linearly independent functions at each point ( except at infinity ) .",
    "the general solution can be written in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions ( chfs ) @xmath36 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as @xmath37    with @xmath38 and @xmath39 being two arbitrary constants and @xmath40 this solution can be expressed in terms of the well - known hermite polynomials if @xmath41 , with @xmath42 being an integer , but even in this case there is a second regular solution which can not be discarded .",
    "hence , it is suitable to work directly with the general solution in terms of chfs ( eq . [ gen_sol ] ) .    regarding the symmetry at @xmath43 , the chfs",
    "have the following property at the origin : @xmath44 so we obtain a symmetric function by setting @xmath45 and an antisymmetric one by setting @xmath46 .    in this work",
    "we use three flux - tube models to investigate the influence of the hot region on the motion of the cool plasma . the cool thread is clearly located in a concave - up field depression or dip as shown in our earlier study @xcite .",
    "model 1 is the simplest : a tube with straight hot regions connecting to the chromosphere ( see upper sketch of fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) .",
    "model 2 is a tube which is concave - up in all domains ( see middle sketch of fig .  [",
    "sketch]b ) . finally , model 3 has the most complex geometry considered in this work , as shown in the bottom sketch of figure  [ sketch ] : a dipped part containing a central cool thread and two hot plasma regions at both sides , connected with two concave - down segments forming the legs of a m - shaped tube .",
    "the solutions of each region of our piecewise flux tube model must be joined by the boundary conditions .",
    "the resulting solutions are the normal modes . to solve this problem we need two types of boundary conditions : line - tying at the chromospheric footpoints of the tube ( located at @xmath47 , with @xmath48 being the length of the supporting magnetic flux tube ) and jump conditions at the plasma interfaces .",
    "we adopt the simplest possible conditions at the footpoints : a line - tied rigid wall with no flow @xcite , namely @xmath49 since the chromosphere is much denser than the corona , it behaves as a purely reflecting layer .",
    "this condition is appropriate mainly because there is not enough energy in the perturbations carried by the coronal material to drive important motions in the chromosphere .",
    "moreover , this simple condition completely decouples the coronal and the photospheric plasmas ( so the dynamics of the photospheric plasma are not taken into account ) , although we plan to address more advanced ",
    "flow - through \" conditions and coupling with the chromosphere in future works .",
    "the second set of boundary conditions is prescribed at the interface between the cool and hot plasmas , located at @xmath50 , with @xmath51 being the length of the dense thread .",
    "we need to carefully deduce these boundary conditions .",
    "following @xcite we integrate the differential equations ( [ linear - eq1])-([linear - eq3 ] ) across the boundary ( from @xmath52 to @xmath53 ) and let @xmath54 .",
    "the integral of any variable that does not have an infinite jump becomes zero in that limit .",
    "first , integrating the hydrostatic equilibrium ( eq .",
    "[ mechequil - eq ] ) we obtain @xmath55=0 $ ] with the commonly used notation @xmath56=a_2-a_1 $ ] for the jump between mediums @xmath7 and @xmath57 . therefore the equilibrium pressure is continuous at the boundary .",
    "similarly , from equations  ( [ linear - eq1])-([linear - eq3 ] ) the two boundary conditions for the velocity are @xmath58_{s = l}=0 , \\,\\,\\,\\ ,   \\left[\\frac{dv}{ds }   \\right]_{s = l}=0~. \\label{jump_cond}\\ ] ] thus , including gravity does not affect the jump conditions , in agreement with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in a first approximation we consider the oscillation of the thread alone , assuming that the hot plasma filling the rest of the tube is irrelevant to the dynamics of the prominence .",
    "this assumption is justified by our previous work @xcite , in which we found that the dynamics of the threads are basically governed by the gravity , and the interaction with the ambient hot plasma is small .",
    "in this situation the boundary conditions of equation ( [ jump_cond ] ) are not applicable .",
    "we assume that the thread moves freely and thus the boundaries at @xmath59 are open .",
    "the motion of the thread is described by equation ( [ gen_sol ] ) ; the @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 parameters can be chosen freely because there is no constraining condition .    in figure",
    "[ chf - plots - fig ] , we have plotted different symmetric and antisymmetric solutions of equation ( [ gen_sol ] ) along the thread , @xmath63 , for different @xmath62 values .    for a symmetric solution and @xmath64 the whole thread moves as a rigid body with an uniform velocity . for a small value ( @xmath65 ) the symmetric velocity distribution differs only slightly from the uniform case : the velocity at the ends of the thread is slightly smaller than in the center .",
    "for @xmath66 the velocity clearly is not uniform but still positive .",
    "for @xmath67 the motion is more complex , however to with the thread ends moving out of phase with respect the center of the thread .",
    "hence , the @xmath62 parameter gives the spatial coherence of the velocity in the thread .",
    "for small @xmath62 the spatial coherence is high , with a uniform velocity distribution , whereas for larger values the spatial coherence is small with steep velocity gradients along the thread . for antisymmetric solutions and @xmath64 both ends of the threads",
    "move in opposite directions , compressing and rarefying the thread plasma , whereas the center remains at rest . for @xmath65",
    "the antisymmetric solution is slightly different , whereas the solution is more complicated for @xmath66 and @xmath68 .",
    "the general solution is a superposition of these modes , where the exact combination depends on the initial conditions .",
    "one special case is worth studying carefully : an exact rigid - body perturbation in which the whole thread is shifted from the initial equilibrium position . in this case",
    "the solution is symmetric and the spatial coherence parameter is @xmath64 .",
    "thus the frequency of the oscillation is @xmath69 this solution was described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) , and predicts the thread oscillating as a gravity - driven pendulum . for a general initial perturbation @xmath70 this solution",
    "is no longer valid and equation ( [ pde_curv ] ) must be solved instead .",
    "we consider now model 1 , where the thread is located in the center of the flux - tube dip and the remainder of the flux tube is straight and filled with hot coronal plasma ( upper sketch of fig .  [ sketch ] ) . the solution to this piecewise model",
    "is given by equation  ( [ gen_sol ] ) in the dense region and equation  ( [ straightwave_eq ] ) with @xmath71 in the evacuated region , namely @xmath72 we have ensured that the line - tying boundary condition ( eq . [ line - tying ] ) is enforced by choosing only the sine function in the hot region .",
    "using the series expansion for the chf , it can be proved that @xmath73 so we recover the fully - straightened case with very large @xmath13 studied in @xcite .",
    "next , we apply the boundary conditions ( eq . [ jump_cond ] ) at the interface between the cool and hot plasma at @xmath59 .",
    "we obtain the following dispersion relation for the symmetric normal modes ( symmetric with respect to @xmath74 ) after eliminating the amplitude constants @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and considering @xmath77 : @xmath78 = - \\frac{l g_0}{c_\\mathrm{sp}^2 r }        \\left(\\frac{\\omega^2 r}{g_0 } -1\\right )   \\nonumber \\\\      & \\times&\\frac{m\\left ( 1+\\frac{1}{2\\gamma}-\\frac{\\omega^2 r}{2 \\gamma g_0 } ,      \\frac{3}{2 } ;       \\frac{\\gamma g_0 l^2}{2 r c_\\mathrm{sp}^2 } \\right)}{m\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\gamma } -       \\frac{\\omega^2 r}{2 \\gamma g_0},\\frac{1}{2 } ;       \\frac{\\gamma g_0 l^2}{2 r c_\\mathrm{sp}^2}\\right)}~. \\label{dr_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we define a new set of dimensionless variables as @xmath79 with these definitions the dispersion relation takes the form @xmath80= \\chi w \\phi \\left ( \\omega^2 - 1 \\right)\\\\ \\times\\frac { m\\left ( 1+\\frac{1}{2\\gamma } -\\frac{\\omega^2}{2\\gamma } , \\frac{3}{2 } ; \\frac{\\chi \\gamma w^2 \\phi^2}{2}\\right ) } {   m\\left ( \\frac{1}{2\\gamma } -\\frac{\\omega^2}{2\\gamma},\\frac{1}{2 } ;   \\frac{\\chi \\gamma w^2 \\phi^2}{2}\\right)}~. \\label{drm1sym - eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath81 is usually called density contrast when the density and pressure are assumed uniform in each segment along the tube .",

    "[ drm1sym - eq ] and [ drm1ant - eq ] ) as a function of the dip radius of curvature @xmath13 .",
    "the fundamental mode ( solid line ) decreases with @xmath13 , clearly indicating that the fundamental mode is affected by the dip curvature .",
    "in contrast , the frequencies of the overtones are independent of @xmath13 , indicating that these overtones are purely sound - like or pressure - driven modes .",
    "we have also plotted the curve @xmath86 ( or equivalently @xmath87 ) , which corresponds to the case where the restoring force of the thread oscillation is exclusively the gravity projected along the tube @xcite .",
    "we see that the fundamental mode is very similar to the gravity - driven oscillation @xmath88 for small values of @xmath13 . for an intermediate radius of curvature , @xmath89 ,",
    "the gravity - driven approximation differs by @xmath90 with respect to the exact solution , and by @xmath91 for a relatively large radius @xmath92 .",
    "therefore the approximation @xmath88 is good for small and intermediate values of @xmath13 .",
    "the increasing deviation from the purely gravity - driven case indicates that the pressure force has some influence for intermediate values of @xmath13 , and becomes important for large radii .    the argument in the chfs of the symmetric dispersion relation ( eq .",
    "[ drm1sym - eq ] ) is small ( @xmath93 ) for the values of the parameters considered here .",
    "additionally , @xmath94 for the fundamental mode .",
    "thus , we expand the dispersion relation and obtain @xmath95 substituting the dimensional variables ( eq .",
    "[ dim_units ] ) yields an approximate expression for the fundamental mode @xmath96 the fundamental frequency has two contributions : the gravity - driven frequency @xmath97 , and the pressure - driven slow oscillation frequency @xmath98 now equation ( [ wap - eq ] ) can be written as @xmath99    figure ( [ wvsr_m1-fig ] ) exhibits a perfect match between the approximate expression and the exact values of the fundamental mode frequencies for a range of @xmath13 values .",
    "the @xmath100 and @xmath101 terms are identical at @xmath102 , while for larger values of @xmath13 the major contribution to the restoring forces is the pressure gradient .",
    "however , the fundamental mode differs significantly from @xmath101 , except at huge values of @xmath13 . @xcite and @xcite studied the oscillation modes of a slab in a kippenhahn - schlter magnetic configuration with a very slight curvature .",
    "they concluded that the forces responsible for the slow modes are the pressure gradients , and the frequency of the fundamental mode is well described by @xmath103 , consistent with the present result .",
    "similarly to the symmetric case we find an approximate expression for the frequency of the first overtone . in the range of small @xmath104 and large @xmath13 the term @xmath105 is small in the antisymmetric dispersion relation ( eq .",
    "[ drm1ant - eq ] ) .",
    "the only way to balance the first term of the right - hand side of the equation is for the argument of the cotangent function to be near the first asymptote ; then @xmath106 in dimensional variables this equation is simply @xmath107 which is the frequency of a standing wave trapped in one of the hot sections of the tube with wavelength @xmath108 . in figure [ wvsr_m1-fig ] we see that the frequency is more or less independent of @xmath13 .    in figure",
    "[ spatialdistmodes - fig ] the velocity perturbations of the first three normal modes are shown . in the fundamental mode",
    "the maximum velocity is centered within the thread and the thread speed is quite uniform , indicating that motion resembles the motion of a solid body . in the coronal part the velocity reduces to zero at the footpoints as dictated by the boundary conditions .",
    "the first overtone is an antisymmetric mode with a node ( @xmath109 ) at the center of the tube . in this mode",
    "the motion consists of compressions and rarefactions of the cool plasma with no net displacement of the thread .",
    "the second overtone has a node at each thread end , so the motion of the plasma is complex in this mode .",
    "all overtones reach their maximum velocities in the coronal parts of the tube .",
    "the frequencies of the symmetric and antisymmetric normal modes as a function of the contrast @xmath81 are shown in figure [ wcontrast - fig ] .",
    "the fundamental mode rapidly reaches a constant value for increasing values of @xmath81 , reflecting a weak dependence on the contrast .",
    "the frequency of the approximation @xmath110 is very similar to the fundamental mode .",
    "for relatively large values of the contrast the match between both curves is very good .",
    "the frequency @xmath101 is inversely proportional to @xmath81 and thus rapidly goes to zero ( triple dot - dash line in fig .",
    "[ wcontrast - fig ] ) , so the main contribution to the fundamental mode ( eq . [ wtotal - eq ] ) comes from the gravity term @xmath111 .",
    "then , for sufficiently large values of @xmath81 , the oscillation of the thread decouples from the hot plasma and is governed by the gravity forces as shown in  [ uncoupled - sec ] .",
    "the frequencies of the overtones have also a complex dependence on @xmath81 , with _ avoided crossings _ between modes .",
    "these avoided crossings are similar to those found in @xcite and @xcite , and have the same origin : two modes can not have the same frequency , since it would violate the conditions in a strm - liouville problem such as our equation ( [ waveadim - eq ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the modes can have extrema in the prominence region and the hot region , and an avoided crossing occurs when the amplitude of the extrema in the prominence region changes from being small ( such as the first overtone in fig .",
    "[ spatialdistmodes - fig ] ) to being larger than the amplitude in the hot region .",
    "we consider next the effects of curvature in the hot parts of the tube , which were assumed to be straight in the previous section .",
    "two different cases are discussed .",
    "we consider a tube with constant curvature in the entire domain ( see middle sketch of fig . [ sketch ] ) .",
    "we assume that isothermal cool plasma occupies the region @xmath63 , while the rest of the tube is filled with isothermal hot plasma . in this model",
    "we have the limitation that @xmath112 in order to satisfy the small - angle approximation @xmath17 ( see  [ tubes - curv - sec ] ) .",
    "thus we can only consider the range of large curvature radii .",
    "as in the previous section (  [ model1-sec ] ) we have found the dispersion relation for the normal modes of this model .",
    "figure [ model - comparison - fig ] shows that the fundamental frequency is essentially identical to that of model 1 .",
    "the frequencies and spatial distribution of the velocity obtained with both symmetric and antisymmetric dispersion relations are very similar to the corresponding solutions of model 1 (  [ model1-sec ] ) for all values of @xmath13 , @xmath113 , @xmath81 , and @xmath104 .",
    "for this reason we do not show the dispersion relations for model 2 .",
    "finally , we consider a more realistic model composed of three different regions ( see bottom sketch of fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) .",
    "the dipped part is equivalent to model 2 , with the cool and dense thread of length @xmath114 centered and filling a portion @xmath51 , and the remaining portion of the dip is filled with hot rarefied plasma .",
    "this dipped part is connected to the chromosphere by two concave - down segments filled with hot plasma .",
    "the resulting flux tube has an `` m '' shape , similar to the thread - bearing flux tubes identified by @xcite .",
    "the new feature of this m - shaped tube is the concave - down region , where the radius of curvature is negative .",
    "thus in this region the linear substitution in equation ( [ chn_var ] ) must be replaced by @xmath115 with @xmath116 , the radius of curvature of the concave - down region . with this new definition equation ( [ wavegravity - eq ] )",
    "becomes @xmath117 the solution of this equation can be written again in terms of chfs as @xmath118 this functional form must be used for @xmath119 , while for @xmath120 , equation ( [ gen_sol ] ) is still valid . using the boundary conditions to match the solutions at @xmath50 , @xmath121 ( eq . [ jump_cond ] ) and the line - tying boundary condition at @xmath122 ( eq . [ line - tying ] )",
    ", we obtain a very cumbersome dispersion relation which involves products of five chfs .",
    "for this reason , this dispersion relation is not shown in here .",
    "figure [ model - comparison - fig ] shows that the fundamental frequency for model 3 is very similar to that of model 1 . in this figure",
    "we have considered a radius of curvature in the flux - tube legs of @xmath123 ( note that this is the smallest possible value allowed by the small angle condition , @xmath124 ) . for larger values of @xmath125",
    "the difference between the frequencies of models 1 and 3 are even smaller , and zero when @xmath126 .",
    "we have also studied the dependence of the frequencies on the other parameters of the system and found identical results .",
    "in our theoretical model of prominence oscillation there are two restoring forces : the gas pressure and the gravity . their relative importance is determined by the ratio @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a reference radius of curvature determined by measurable filament properties .",
    "the restoring force of the lal oscillation is mainly the solar gravity when this ratio is small , i.e. , @xmath129 .",
    "in contrast , the oscillation is pressure - driven for a large value of the ratio or @xmath130 . with the data shown in figure  [ wvsr_m1-fig ] we find that @xmath131 , so for smaller radii of curvature the gravity is the restoring force .",
    "the length of the threads and density contrast have a wide range of measured or estimated values ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "considering larger values of the thread length and contrast of @xmath132 and @xmath133 , we find @xmath134 , indicating that the gravity dominates even for almost flat tubes .",
    "@xcite studied the observed longitudinal oscillations of a prominence , and found a small radius of curvature less than @xmath135 .",
    "therefore the restoring force is certainly the gravity , as we would expect in those structures .",
    "additionally , the relative importance of the two restoring forces also depends on the geometrical parameter @xmath136 ( eq . [ ratiosoundgravity - eq ] ) , which can be determined from the global geometry of the filament magnetic structure . for the deep - dip flux tubes of a double sheared arcade @xcite ,",
    "this factor is always @xmath137 @xcite .    in ",

    "the coherence parameter is @xmath65 .",
    "the velocity profile for this parameter value plotted in figure  [ chf - plots - fig ] , is quite flat in the thread , indicating that the motion is very similar to the displacement of a rigid solid body .",

    "we also inferred the radius of curvature from the oscillation periods reported by @xcite and @xcite , and found @xmath141 and @xmath142 respectively .",
    "@xcite observationally determined the radius of filament - dip curvatures to be less than @xmath135 .",
    "thus , the observations and theoretical models are consistent with this range of small and intermediate @xmath13 . for larger radii",
    "the pressure force becomes more important and the fundamental frequency differs from @xmath100 .",
    "the frequencies of the overtones are basically independent of the curvature of the tube , consistent with the slow nature of these modes .",
    "the fundamental mode is also weakly dependent on the density contrast , @xmath81 , for small contrast , but as @xmath81 increases the fundamental mode rapidly reaches a constant value that coincides with @xmath110 or @xmath100 ( note that @xmath143 because @xmath101 is very small for relatively large contrast ) .",
    "therefore the oscillation of the thread decouples from the environment for relatively larger values of the contrast , and the thread oscillates with the frequency @xmath100 .",
    "observational estimates of prominence densities give a broad range of possible @xmath81 values , but typically the density contrast is 100 or larger ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "therefore the threads are in the range of large density contrasts .",
    "the overtones depend on @xmath81 , indicating the sound - like nature of these modes .",
    "the spatial velocity distribution of the fundamental mode along the tube is symmetric with respect to the tube center ; although the maximum is located at the thread center , the velocity in the thread is more or less uniform . in the fundamental mode",
    "the motion is mainly concentrated in the thread .",
    "the overtones produce complex compression and rarefaction motions with small or zero net displacements of the thread .    in models 2 and 3 , with curved hot regions , the frequencies and the spatial distribution",
    "are very similar to the corresponding values for model 1 .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the shape of the hot regions is irrelevant to the longitudinal oscillation , and that using a straight field - line approximation in these regions gives results that are accurate enough and much easier to compute .",
    "hence , the approximation given in equation  ( [ wtotal - eq ] ) is quite robust , despite only being truly valid for model 1 .",
    "the sound speed in the corona is very high , and the contribution of the first term in equation ( [ pde_curv ] ) is larger than terms involving curvature .",
    "thus , the resulting motion in the coronal parts of the flux tube is well described by equation ( [ straightwave_eq ] ) .",
    "the relative importance of the pressure and gravity forces is determined by the geometry of the dipped part of the filament flux tubes .",
    "we found that the oscillation is gravity driven when @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is determined by the properties of the filament flux tubes and the cool thread . for typical prominences",
    "@xmath145 is much larger than the radius of curvature of filament models or observationally inferred values .",
    "we conclude that the longitudinal oscillations of a prominence are strongly influenced by the curvature of the dipped magnetic fields . in the fundamental mode the gravity dominates for small and intermediate radius of curvature , consistent with values in our multi - threaded prominence model @xcite and with the values derived from observed oscillations .",
    "similarly , for relatively large density contrast between the prominence and the corona the main restoring force is also the gravity .",
    "thus , the frequency of the lal oscillations is given by @xmath146 , and the pressure forces introduce only a small correction , showing that the lal oscillations are not pure slow modes .",
    "this demonstrates that the @xmath100 expression is robust and can be used for seismology of prominences , as we showed in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we have not studied the damping of the observed lal oscillations . in @xcite",
    "we found that the damping is associated with mass accretion onto the threads and nonadiabatic effects .",
    "the former produces strong damping at the beginning of the oscillation , and the latter yields a weak damping throughout the oscillation . in order to have a full and self - consistent model of prominence oscillations",
    "we must perform a nonlinear study , including the temporal variation of the prominence mass and the nonadiabatic effects",
    ". this will be the subject of a future work .",
