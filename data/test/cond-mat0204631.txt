    "it leads to linear distribution of the temperature along the chain , but the value of heat flux is proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the number of particles in the chain .",

    "analytical estimations @xcite have demonstrated that any chain possessing acoustic phonon branch should have infinite heat conductivity in the limit of low temperatures . from the other side , there are some artificial systems with on - site potential having normal heat conductivity @xcite",

    "these models are not invariant with respect to translation and the momentum is not conserved .",
    "it was supposed that the on - site potential is extremely significant for normal heat conduction @xcite and that the anharmonicity of the on - site potential is sufficient to ensure the validity of fourier law @xcite .",

    "it was demonstrated @xcite that the transition to normal heat conductivity corresponds to abrupt growth of concentration of rotation solitons ( rotobreathers ) , demonstrating certain similarity with phase transition .",
