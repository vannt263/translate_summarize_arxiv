    "there is much reliable evidence for the existence of dark matter ( dm ) which is mainly associated with the missing mass problem .",

    "indirect techniques include efforts to detect gamma rays from dm annihilation using telescopes such as the fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat , @xcite ) , the major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cherenkov ( magic ) telescope @xcite , the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ,",
    "@xcite ) and the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas , @xcite ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it was first suggested by gondolo and silk @xcite that adiabatic growth of a bh at the center of a dm halo whose density had a singular power - law cusp @xmath4 with @xmath5 led to a high density dm region around the central bh , @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "this region is called a dm spike . inside the spike ,",
    "dm annihilations are enhanced and produce the strong gamma - ray photon flux which could be detectable to the telescopes mentioned above .    however , subsequent studies pointed out that this spike could be weakened by dynamical processes such as mergers of host - galaxies , sub - halo accretion and passing of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "these processes transfer energy to the dm particles and destroy the structure of the dm spike .",
    "then the annihilation rate in the spike is smaller than predicted in @xcite because it depends on the line - of - sight integral of the squared density of the spike .",
    "if supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) have experienced mergers , they are unlikely to have surviving spike structure .",
    "even this however is controversial because of the uncertainty in whether the final parsec problem for smbh mergers has been resolved phenomenologically @xcite or even theoretically @xcite . on the other hand , formation scenarios of intermediate - mass black holes ( imbh ) which allow",
    "dm mini - spikes have been proposed @xcite .",
    "if the imbh have never experienced mergers in the past , the dm mini - spike around the central imbh is likely to survive .",
    "imbhs may exist in our universe @xcite , and even several hundreds would reside in the halo of the present - day milky way galaxy @xcite .",
    "those imbhs in globular clusters are recognized as promising sources for the evolved laser interferometer space antenna ( elisa ) @xcite / the new gravitational wave observatory ( ngo ) @xcite and deci - hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( decigo)@xcite .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we demonstrated that a very tiny effect such as the gravitational pull of a dm mini - spike around an imbh indeed affects detectability of gw by elisa and thereby we could infer presence or absence of a dm mini - spike around an imbh using gw . specifically , when a stellar mass object inspirals into the central imbh , it is affected by the gravitational force of not only the central imbh but also the mini - spike . therefore the inspiral gw is modified by the mini - spike around the central imbh .",
    "we found that the very tiny effect from gravitational pull of a dm mini - spike could have a large impact on detectability of the gw , thanks to the huge number of orbital cycles which the binary experienced in the elisa detection frequency band .",
    "we also found that gw detectability strongly depends on the density profile of the dm mini - spike .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our previous work in the following way .",
    "we again consider gws emitted from a binary system consisting of a stellar mass object and an imbh harbored in a dm mini - spike , and calculate the gw waveform including the effect of both the gravitational potential and the dynamical friction on the falling stellar mass object in the dm mini - spike .",
    "furthermore , we investigate how accurately the dm parameters are determined by the gw observations .",
    "we find that the dm information contained in the waveform can be extracted with very good accuracy by gw observations if the central imbh has a steep density mini - spike .",
    "we also investigate how the detection accuracy of the dm parameters changes depending on the masses of the binary components and the density profile of the dm mini - spike such as the power index and overall normalization .",
    "recently @xcite made clear the importance of the dynamical friction on the gw waveform in a quite different context from ours , namely , a stellar mass object falling in a compact configuration of dm clouds @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite has given a wide survey on astrophysical environmental effects on gw signals using order of magnitude estimates , concluding that astrophysical environmental effects such as accretion disks , magnetic fields , and dm halos do not obscure gravitational wave astrophysics , e.g. , precision measurements of binary masses and tests of general relativity @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "to indicate one exception , our paper shall clearly show that , in the recently advocated dm mini - spike scenario , environmental effects do affect gw detectability @xcite and we can measure dm properties quite accurately from elisa gw detection , which will be shown through a detailed study using a matched filtering technique and fisher matrix analysis .",
    "we stress that while gamma - ray observations from dm annihilations can only work if the dm is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , the gw observations we proposed should be widely applicable to any type of dm particles . furthermore",
    ", matter is almost completely transparent to gws unlike electromagnetic waves because of the smallness of their gravitational cross - section .",
    "hence , the gws carry pure information on the dm from the mini - spike to the detector .",
    "future gw experiments will probe the structure of the dm mini - spike and will even offer a hint on the nature of the dm particle .",
