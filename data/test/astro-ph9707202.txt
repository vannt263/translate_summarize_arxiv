    "ngc  5548 is one of the brightest seyfert 1 galaxies with optical / uv / x@xmath0 continuum consisting of three characteristic components : the big blue bump , the soft - excess , and the hard x - ray thermal comptonization continuum with the reflection hump .",
    "these components are known to be highly variable , but there have been no observing campaigns covering all of them simultaneously . the only simultaneous _ iue_/_ginga _ campaign ( clavel et al .",
    "1992 ; nandra et al .",
    "1993 ) showed a tight correlation between the uv bump and hard x - ray component , thus supporting uv / x - ray reprocessing models .",
    "recently , marshall et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have found a correlation between the uv and the soft x - ray component which suggests that the soft - excess also participates in the reprocessing . we analyze a composite broad - band optical / uv / x@xmath0 spectrum in order to develop a continuum model and apply it to re - analyze the variability correlations in a simultaneous sub - set of available _",
    "iue_/_ginga _ observations .",
    "the optical/_iue _ and _ ginga _ data come from the simultaneous sub set of the jan .",
    "1989july 1990 campaign reported by clavel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and nandra et al .",
    "( 1991 ) respectively .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "data is an average spectrum over a monitoring campaign of dec .",
    "1992jan .  1993",
    "( done et al.1995 ) .",
    "gro_/osse data were compiled by mcnaron - brown et al .",
    "( 1997 , in preparation ) from phase 1 and 3 observations .",
    "we use the _ ginga _ data from both the top - layer and mid - layer of the lac detector .",
    "the mid - layer gives more effective area in the 1020 kev range which is crucial for determining the compton reflection component .",
    "that layer had previously been ignored due to problems with background subtraction .",
    "we find the average spectra from non - simultaneous observations to be consistent within statistical discrepancies with that from the simultaneous campaign .",
    "however , the results have to be treated carefully since the averaging of the highly variable spectrum produces very wide confidence limits .",
    "the soft - excess component contributes significantly up to an energy @xmath12 kev ( fig .",
    "1a ) which is marginally observed in the _ ginga _ data .",
    "as was shown by fiore , matt , and nicastro ( 1997 ) , this component can not be simply explained by atomic processes .",
    "gro_/osse spectra are consistent with a constant high energy cut - off at about 100 kev , and no variations of the spectral shape .",
    "this gives comptonizing plasma parameters of @xmath250 kev and @xmath32 , consistent with those typical of seyfert 1s ( zdziarski et al .",
    "our re - analysis of the _ rosat _ campaign shows that the average data well constrain the soft - excess spectral index , @xmath4=@xmath5 , but do not constrain the energy cut - off .",
    "this , however , is well established at e@xmath6=@xmath7 kev from _ ginga _ observations .",
    "the average _ iue _ data well constrain both the reddening of the spectrum e(b@xmath8v)=@xmath9 , and the maximum disk temperature @xmath10=@xmath11 ev .",
    "this argues against the high temperature disk ( in agreement with laor et al.1997 ) .",
    "it is energetically possible for the entire blue bump ( the dot - long - dash curve in fig .",
    "1b ) to arise from reprocessing of the hard continuum assuming the x/@xmath0 source forms a patchy corona above the surface of the disk .",
    "however , the nature of the soft excess remains unclear in a such model and it is hard to explain the tight correlation in simultaneous _",
    "iue__euve _ observations ( marshall et al .",
    "1997 ) . on the other hand , extrapolation of the _ rosat _ soft x - ray power - law points exactly to the uv component , suggesting a comptonization origin . then the blue bump turns out to be dominated by comptonization ( the short - dash , and the dot - short - dash in fig .",
    "1b ) , and contains about half the total flux .",
    "however , comptonizing the disk component by a hypothetical cold plasma requires an extreme optical depth ( @xmath12@xmath130 ) , which needs to be explained by stratification of temperature and optical depth ( nandra et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the hard x - ray continuum shows significant correlation between the total flux changes and the spectral index and amount of reflection ( fig .",
    "such a pattern of spectral variability suggests changes in the source geometry which produce more reflection when the source is brighter and softer .",
    "the total x/@xmath0 flux is correlated with the total optical / uv flux ( cf .",
    "nandra et al .  1993 ) , but the energy balance is dependent on the spectral model assumed .",
    "the soft excess component required by the _ ginga _",
    "data seems to vary in a correlated fashion with the total flux emitted by the x/@xmath0 continuum ( fig .",
    "3a ) . the cut - off energy of the soft - excess is consistent with being constant over the hard continuum changes ( fig .",
    "the above results suggest that the soft - excess component is related to reprocessing .",
    "marshall et al.s ( 1997 ) results suggest much higher variability amplitude in the euv than in the uv .",
    "hence one should expect variability in the soft - excess spectral index , which is consistent with the overall ` harder when brighter ' variability pattern in the optical / uv , but opposite to the ` softer when brighter ' pattern in the hard x/@xmath0 continuum .",
    "we have shown that the soft - excess component in ngc  5548 may contribute to the energy reprocessing and its variability behavior is consistent with that of the big blue bump .",
    "the soft - excess is consistent with optically thick comptonization , probably in a complex , stratified plasma .",
    "if the soft - excess is actually related to optically thick comptonization , the entire big blue bump and the soft - excess may be dominated by the same component .",
    "this would explain both the tight _ iue__euv _ correlation ( marshall et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the absence of a lyman edge in the uv spectrum ( kriss et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
