    "the lep centre - of - mass energy for @xmath10 collisions is now well above the kinematic threshold for w - pair production allowing for the study of radiative w - pair production , @xmath0 . the standard model ( sm )  @xcite predicts the existence of quartic gauge couplings ( qgcs ) , leading to @xmath4 production via @xmath11-channel exchange of a @xmath12 or z boson as shown in figure  [ fey]a .",
    "as the contribution of these two quartic feynman diagrams with respect to the other competing diagrams , mainly initial - state radiation , is negligible at the lep centre - of - mass energies , the process leading to the final state could thus be sensitive to anomalous contributions to the sm quartic gauge - boson vertices @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the existence of anomalous qgcs ( aqgcs ) would also affect the @xmath13 process via the @xmath3 fusion feynman diagram containing the @xmath7 vertex  @xcite ( see figure  [ fey]b ) . in the sm",
    "the reaction @xmath14 proceeds predominantly through @xmath11-channel z exchange and @xmath15-channel w exchange , with the two photons coming from initial state radiation , whereas the sm contribution from the @xmath3 fusion is negligible at lep .",
    "aqgcs would enhance the @xmath16 production rate , especially for the hard tail of the photon energy distribution and for photons produced at large angles with respect to the beam direction .",
    "here we describe the cross section measurement for the process @xmath0 and the determination of aqgcs using the data collected in 1998 with the l3 detector  @xcite at @xmath17 ( denoted as @xmath18 hereafter ) corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 176.8pb@xmath2 .",
    "aqgcs are also independently determined using acoplanar photon - pair events with missing energy .",
    "this analysis is performed using the data at @xmath18 and at @xmath19 collected in  1997 ( denoted as @xmath20 hereafter ) corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 231.7pb@xmath2 .",
    "the results derived on aqgcs from the and channels are finally combined .",
    "the search for anomalous contributions to the sm quartic couplings is performed within the theoretical framework of references and .",
    "recently , experimental measurements for these couplings have already been performed on final states with three vector bosons @xmath4",
    "@xcite and @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "there are 14 feynman diagrams at the tree level leading to the @xmath4 final state , and many other diagrams corresponding to photons from the decay products of hadronic or leptonic w s .",
    "we are interested only in two of these , the quartic diagrams .",
    "the other diagrams leading to the same final state are initial state radiation ( isr ) , final state radiation ( fsr ) , and radiation from the w boson itself .",
    "the monte carlo used for the cross section determination is koralw  @xcite .",
    "this generator does not include the quartic coupling diagrams .",
    "initial state multi - photon radiation is implemented in koralw in the full photon phase space .",
    "fsr from charged leptons in the event up to double bremsstrahlung is included using the photos  @xcite package .",
    "fragmentation processes of quarks into hadrons are made according to the jetset  @xcite algorithm including photons in the parton shower . for the @xmath4 cross section measurement ,",
    "this modelling is sufficient since the contribution of all the other diagrams is very small .",
    "the background processes such as @xmath22 and @xmath23 are simulated using pythia  @xcite .",
    "the l3 detector response is simulated by the program geant  @xcite .",
    "+ in this analysis , the @xmath4 signal is defined by the following phase - space cuts :    * @xmath24 5 gev , where @xmath25 is the energy of the photon , * @xmath26 20@xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the angle between the photon and the beam axis , * @xmath29 20@xmath27 , where @xmath30 is the angle between the direction of the photon and that of the closest charged lepton or jet .",
    "these cuts are mainly chosen for experimental reasons , to optimise the photon identification and the background suppression .",
    "they also largely avoid any infrared and collinear singularities in the calculation of the signal cross section .",
    "the theoretically predicted from koralw corresponds to 272 @xmath31 4(stat ) fb . in the eewwg program  @xcite the effect of undetected additional isr collinear to the beam pipe",
    "is included  @xcite by implementing the excalibur  @xcite collinear radiator function .",
    "the effect of the higher order radiative corrections is to move the effective centre - of - mass energy towards lower values , reducing the expected signal cross section by about 18% .",
    "the resulting eewwg corresponds to 233 @xmath31 12(theor ) fb .",
    "this is used as the sm expectation in the anomalous coupling analysis , which leads to less stringent constraints on aqgcs .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty  @xcite is propagated to the aqgc determination .",
    "consistent results are obtained with the yfsww3  @xcite mc which predicts 224 @xmath31 6(stat )  fb .",
    "differences of this order in the predicted with high transverse momentum photons are expected  @xcite between pure leading - log and leading - log plus matrix - element based calculations .",
    "the w - pair event selections used here are similar to those reported in reference .",

    "the efficiencies shown here include the contribution of cross efficiencies from the other w - pair decay modes . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath4 cross section is evaluated channel by channel and then combined according to the sm w - pair branching fractions .",
    "the result is : @xmath34 where the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "the measurement is in good agreement with both the koralw and eewwg sm expectations .",
    "figure  [ fig : xsec ] shows the result obtained together with the predicted total @xmath4 cross section from the eewwg monte carlo as a function of the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the systematic uncertainties arising in the inclusive w - pair event selections  @xcite are propagated to the final measurement and correspond to an uncertainty of @xmath31 6.3 fb .",
    "other possible systematic biases due to detector effects such as electro - magnetic cluster resolution , angular resolution , and calorimetric energy scale uncertainty are found to have a negligible effect on the final result .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty is dominated by the jetset modelling of photons from meson decays ( @xmath35 ) . to estimate this effect ,",
    "a data sample of 3.9 pb@xmath2 collected in 1998 at @xmath36 91 gev is studied . the same photon identification criteria are applied to the selected @xmath37 events .",
    "an overall excess of ( @xmath38)% in the photon rate is found in data with respect to the pythia monte carlo which uses the same jetset fragmentation algorithm and particle decays as koralw . a correction factor given by the ratio of photon production rates in data and mc",
    "is determined as a function of the photon energy .",
    "this correction is applied to the background component of @xmath39 mc events as well as to the hadronic side of the @xmath4 mc events .",
    "the uncertainty on this correction is propagated to the measurement as a systematic uncertainty on the @xmath4 cross section which corresponds to @xmath31 15 fb . +",
    "the selected @xmath4 events allow us to constrain anomalous contributions to the sm quartic gauge boson vertices . in the framework of references and ,",
    "the extended lagrangian includes new dimension-6 operators , [ l0 ] l_0 & = & - f^ f _   + l_c & = & - f^ f _",
    "+ l_n & = & - _ ijk w_^(i ) w_^(j ) w^(k ) f^ , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are the aqgcs , and @xmath43 represents the energy scale for new physics .",
    "the two parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which are separately c and p conserving , generate anomalous @xmath7 and @xmath44 vertices .",
    "the term @xmath42 , which is cp violating , gives rise to an anomalous contribution to @xmath8 .",
    "although there are already direct  @xcite and indirect  @xcite limits on @xmath40 and @xmath41 , only the study of @xmath4 events allows for a direct measurement of the anomalous coupling @xmath42 through the @xmath45 vertex .",
    "the eewwg program implements the effects of the aqgcs through the extended sm lagrangian .",
    "figure  [ fig : xsec ] shows how the anomalous coupling @xmath42 manifests itself through a deviation of the total cross section .",
    "the anomalous component from the above operators is linear in the photon energy at the matrix element level  @xcite .",
    "this implies that also the shape of the photon spectrum is affected by aqgcs , in particular , the hard part of the energy distribution ( see figure  [ fig : sele]a ) .",
    "the expected distribution for any value of the three aqgcs is obtained by reweighting each koralw mc event with the ratio @xmath46 of the known differential distributions of e@xmath47 at generator level : ( e_,a_0,a_c , a_n )   =   ( a_0,a_c , a_n ) /   .",
    ".the reweighting procedure is applied only to the isr component of the mc selected sample , while the fsr ( from koralw ) and the background components of accepted events are kept fixed .",
    "the possible dependence of the selection efficiency on the photon polar angle and on the angular separation from the charged fermions in the event is found to be negligible .",
    "both the shape and the normalisation of the observed photon spectrum in the range from 5  to 30  are used in a maximum - likelihood fit to each of the anomalous couplings @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , fixing the other two to zero .",
    "the effects of the same systematic uncertainties described for the cross section measurement are included , yielding the 68% cl intervals : @xmath48 the results are in good agreement with the sm value of zero for each of the anomalous quartic gauge couplings .",
    "the 1-parameter limits at 95% cl are : @xmath49",
    "the selection of acoplanar multi - photon events is identical to that described in reference .",
    "at least two photons with energies greater than 5  and 1  are required , with polar angles between 14@xmath27 and 166@xmath27 .",
    "the koralz  @xcite and nunugpv  @xcite monte carlo generators are used to model the @xmath14 process according to the sm .",
    "the effects of the aqgcs  and  are simulated using the eenunuggano program  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath16 production is not sensitive to the @xmath42  coupling .",
    "we select 14 events at @xmath50 and 21 events at @xmath51 compared to a sm expectation of 13.3 and 36.2 events respectively .",
    "the eenunuggano program does not describe the effects of the sm @xmath11-channel z exchange diagrams and the interference between these diagrams and the @xmath3 fusion diagram containing the @xmath52 vertex . therefore additional cuts are applied to suppress the sm contribution .",
    "the energy of both photons must be greater than 10  .",
    "if both photons are in the barrel region ( @xmath53 ) , either the recoil mass must be less than 80  or the sum of the photon energies must be greater than 100  . if one or two photons are in the endcaps , where the sm contribution is larger , the recoil mass must be less than 75  . after applying these cuts no data event is selected , consistent with the sm expectation of 0.15 events .",
    "the expected number of events for any aqgc value is calculated based on a sample of ten thousand simulated eenunuggano events generated for several values of  and .",
    "its matrix element is used to reweight the events to any aqgc value required , testing the procedure by comparing the reweighted distributions to those from samples generated at various values of aqgcs . in all cases good agreement is observed .",
    "since the program does not include higher order corrections due to isr , these effects are estimated by implementing the excalibur  @xcite collinear radiator function .",
    "the cross section is reduced by about 16% which is used in the following .",
    "the remaining theoretical uncertainty of 5%  @xcite is taken into account in the aqgc limits .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the selection efficiency  @xcite gives a much smaller contribution .",
    "the 95% cl upper limit on the number of expected events from the aqgc signal is obtained taking into account the systematic error on the accepted cross section ; this corresponds to the following 1-parameter limits at 95% cl : @xmath54",
    "all results obtained results are in a good agreement with the sm expectation of zero for each anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings .    combining the results on  and  from our analyses of @xmath4 and @xmath55 production , we derive the following 1-parameter 95% cl limits : @xmath56",
    "we thank j. w. stirling and a. werthenbach for providing us with the @xmath0 and the @xmath57 analytical calculations including aqgcs .",
    "we wish to express our gratitude to the cern accelerator divisions for the superb performance and the continuous and successful upgrade of the lep machine .",
