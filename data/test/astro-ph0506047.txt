    "early radio surveys found that classical radio galaxies ( @xmath2 jy ) evolve strongly with time in both density and luminosity , and are relatively rare in the local universe @xcite .",
    "more recent surveys which probe to fainter flux densities have shown that the normalised source count flattens below a few mjy @xcite .",
    "this flattening corresponds to a rapid increase in the number of faint radio sources , and has been interpreted as being due to a new population of sources which do not show up at higher flux density levels - the so called sub - mjy population .",
    "the existing sub - mjy samples are generally small due to the large amount of observing time required to reach these faint levels .",
    "several models , involving different classes of objects , have been developed to explain the observed sub - mjy source counts .",
    "these include a strongly evolving population of normal spiral galaxies @xcite or actively star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "a non evolving population of local ( @xmath3 ) low luminosity radio galaxies has also been proposed to explain the sub - mjy population @xcite .",
    "it is now thought that the sub - mjy population is comprised of low luminosity agn , normal spirals and ellipticals , as well as starbursts , but the exact mix is unknown .",
    "the nature of the sub - mjy population is still not clear because of the difficulty of obtaining optical photometry and spectra for complete radio samples .",
    "the follow up optical identification and spectroscopy of sub - mjy radio samples require a lot of telescope time because these sources generally have very faint optical counterparts .",
    "conclusions about the sub - mjy sample have been inferred from surveys of varying radio sensitivity and different depths of optical follow up .",
    "approximately 41% of sub - mjy ( @xmath4 mjy ) radio sources are identified with optical counterparts to @xmath5 and these are mostly faint blue galaxies with optical - infrared colours indicative of active star formation @xcite .",
    "this result is confirmed by a spectroscopic study of optical counterparts ( @xmath6 ) to faint ( @xmath7mjy ) radio sources , which found that most of the sub - mjy sources have spectra similar to star forming _",
    "iras _ galaxies @xcite",
    ". however , this result is obtained from spectroscopy of only 10% of their whole radio sample .",
    "a more spectroscopically complete sample is the marano field , where spectra were obtained for 50% of the 68 faint ( @xmath8 mjy ) radio sources @xcite .",
    "contrary to previous results of @xcite , the majority of the spectra are identified with early type galaxies .",
    "gruppioni et al .",
    "attribute this discrepancy to the fainter magnitude limit reached in their spectroscopic identifications , since the fraction of radio sources identified with early type galaxies increases abruptly at @xmath9 , which is the limit of the benn et al . sample .",
    "about 60% ( 219/386 ) of the faint ( @xmath10 mjy ) radio sources in the australia telescope eso slice project ( atesp , @xcite ) are identified to i = 22.5 mag .",
    "the spectra obtained for 70 sources with i @xmath11 19 are dominated by early type galaxies ( 60% ) .",
    "starbursts and post - starburst galaxies become important in the sub - mjy ( @xmath12 mjy ) regime , where they make up 39% of the i @xmath11 19 sample @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , prandoni et al .",
    "find that early type galaxies still constitute a significant fraction ( 25% ) of the sub - mjy radio sources , and sub - mjy samples with fainter spectroscopic limits become increasingly sensitive to early type galaxies .",
    "the phoenix deep field survey covers a 4.5 deg@xmath13 at 1.4 ghz and has a rms noise of 12 @xmath1jy over the most sensitive region @xcite .",
    "a subregion covering about a degree has been imaged to r @xmath14 24.5 and optical counterparts found for 76% of radio sources within the imaged area @xcite .",
    "spectra of the radio sources revealed that the sub - mjy population is made up of at least 32% starforming galaxies and",
    "21% are quiescent galaxies @xcite",
    ". however , @xcite only have spectra for 17% of their radio sources , and the spectral completeness is biased to the optically brighter radio sources ( r @xmath15 ) .",
    "the most complete result in photometry is in the hubble deep field north ( hdfn ) where the vla was used to follow up observations of a patch of sky observed by the hst to depths of about 30th magnitude in the four hst broadband filters , f300w , f450w , f606w , and f814w ( approximately u , b , v , and i ) .",
    "eighty percent of the 79 faint ( @xmath16 mjy ) radio sources in the hdfn region were identified by hst and ground based images reaching @xmath17 @xcite . using optical and radio morphologies along with radio spectral index arguments , richards et al .",
    "concluded that 60% of the hdfn radio sources with optical counterparts were star forming galaxies ,",
    "20% were classed as agn , and the remainder were ambiguous .    in 1998 ,",
    "the hst observed a region of sky in the southern continuous viewing zone ( cvz ) as a complementary observation to the northern hubble deep field @xcite .",
    "this field is known as the hubble deep field south ( hdfs ) @xcite .",
    "a region containing a quasar suitable for the search of lyman alpha absorption systems was chosen .",

    "simultaneous observations with the other hst instruments , nicmos and stis , reach similarly deep levels in the near - infrared and ultraviolet .",
    "in addition to the main hst deep fields , a mosaic of nine flanking fields were imaged to shallower levels of @xmath1425th in i ( f814w ) . from the ground , deep wide field images have been obtained , reaching depths of @xmath1425th magnitude in ubvri in a 44 @xmath18 44 arcmin region centered on the hdfs @xcite .",
    "spectroscopically , 194 galaxies in the main hdfs and flanking fields were targeted on the very large telescope ( vlt ) and reliable redshifts obtained for 97 targets @xcite .",
    "in addition , optical spectroscopy is available for 225 bright ( r@xmath19 ) sources in a @xmath20 arcmin region containing the stis and wfpc fields ( glazebrook , in preparation , but see http://www.aao.gov.au/hdfs/redshifts/ ) .",
    "the hdfs was selected as a region for deep radio follow up to take advantage of the wealth of publicly available optical / near - infrared photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "observations over 1998 to 2001 were performed on the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at all four available frequency bands .",
    "approximately 100 hours observing at each band yielded images at 1.4 , 2.5 , 5.2 , and 8.7 ghz with sensitivities of approximately 10 @xmath1jy rms .",

    "this paper describes the image analysis and source extraction technique of the full 1.4 ghz athdfs survey .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarise the 1.4 ghz observations and data reduction .",
    "various image properties are discussed in section 3 and the source extraction and catalogue is detailed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 contains an analysis of the accuracy of our source parameters .",
    "the survey completeness is investigated in section 6 and the athdfs 1.4 ghz differential radio source count is presented in section 7 .",
    "paper i discussed in detail the observations and data reduction steps used to obtain the athdfs images . here we provide a brief summary .    the 1.4 ghz observations were carried out over four years from 1998 to 2001 .",
    "they consist of single pointings centred on ra = 22h 33 m 25.96s and dec = @xmath2160@xmath22 38 09.0 ",
    "( j2000 ) .",
    "a wide variety of atca configurations was employed to ensure maximum _ uv _ coverage .",
    "the correlator was set to continuum mode ( @xmath23 mhz bandwidth ) , with each 128 mhz bandwidth divided into @xmath24 mhz channels .",
    "the primary flux density calibrator used was pks b1934 - 638 , while secondary gain and phase calibrations were performed through observations of either pks b2205 - 636 or pks b2333 - 528 .",
    "the data were inspected using the _ miriad _ interactive task _ tvflag_. after flagging , the 1.4 ghz data were split into the three observing bands ( 1.344 , 1.384 and 1.432 ghz ) before imaging and cleaning .",
    "this allowed the cleaning process to do a much better job of removing all the flux of a source .",
    "two iterations of both phase and amplitude self - calibration were then performed to improve the image quality .",
    "in this section we discuss two systematic effects which have to be taken into account in deriving source flux densities , the clean bias and bandwidth smearing .",
    "we use methods similar to those outlined in @xcite to investigate clean bias and bandwidth smearing . a master equation to derive flux densities corrected for these effects is given in appendix a.      when the _ uv _ coverage is incomplete the cleaning process can redistribute flux from real sources to noise peaks , producing spurious sources .",
    "this effect is generally only a problem for snapshot observations where _ uv _ coverage is poor . although our _ uv _ coverage is very good , tests were performed to check the magnitude of the clean bias in our image .",
    "we performed a clean bias check by injecting point sources into the _ uv _ data at random positions .",
    "the _ uv _ data were then cleaned to the same rms level as our original image , and source peak fluxes after cleaning were compared to input values .",
    "the flux density distribution of injected sources was chosen to be similar to that of the real sources in the image : 40 at @xmath25 , 15 at @xmath26 , 15 at @xmath27 , 15 at @xmath28 , 15 at @xmath29 , 10 at @xmath30 , 3 at @xmath31 , 2 at @xmath32 , 1 at @xmath33 and 1 at @xmath34 .",
    "this simulation was repeated 50 times to get reliable number statistics .",
    "the results from this process are shown in figure [ fig : clnbias ] .",
    "the average source flux measured after the cleaning process ( s@xmath35 ) normalised to the true source flux ( s@xmath36 ) is shown for the various values of input source signal - to - noise ( s@xmath37 ) .",
    "it is evident that clean bias only affects the faintest sources .",
    "there is a sudden increase in the clean bias at a flux density of about @xmath30 , but even at the faintest bin ( @xmath25 ) the clean bias is only 4% .",
    "an analytical form of the clean bias effect was obtained by a least squares fit to the function @xmath38 the best fit values for @xmath39 and @xmath40 are 1.00 and @xmath210.23 , respectively .",
    "the resulting best fit curve is plotted in figure [ fig : clnbias ] .",
    "bandwidth smearing , the radio analogue of optical chromatic aberration , is a well - known effect caused by the finite width of the receiver channels .",
    "it reduces the peak flux density of a source , while correspondingly increasing the source size in the radial direction such that the total integrated flux density is conserved .",
    "the amount of smearing is proportional to the distance from the phase centre , and the bandwidth of the observations . in the simplest case of a gaussian beam and passband",
    ", the bandwidth smearing can be described by @xcite : @xmath41 where the ratio @xmath42 represents the attenuation of the source peak flux density with respect to that of an unsmeared source , @xmath43 is the passband width , @xmath44 is the observing frequency , @xmath45 is the distance from the phase centre , and @xmath46 is the synthesized beam fwhm .",
    "although the observational bandwidth is 4 mhz , the _ miriad _ task _ atlod _ effectively doubles the channel bandwidth .",
    "so with the athdfs channel width ( @xmath43 ) of 8 mhz and observing frequency ( @xmath44 ) of 1.4 ghz , equation  [ eq : bandsmear ] simplifies to : @xmath47 the bandwidth smearing as a function of distance from the centre is plotted in figure [ fig : bandsmear ] , calculated with the appropriate athdfs beamsize parameter .",
    "the majority of our radio sources lie within the inner 10 @xmath18 10 arcmin region , where the bandwidth smearing is less than 5% .",
    "the attenuation increases rapidly however , and is @xmath48% at a radial distance of 20 arcmin from the phase centre .",
    "to investigate the noise characteristics of our 1.4 ghz image we constructed a noise map .",
    "the noise map which contains the pixel by pixel root mean square ( rms ) noise distribution was made using the sextractor package @xcite .",
    "sextractor initially estimates the local background in each mesh from the pixel data , and the local background histogram is clipped iteratively until convergence at @xmath49 around its median .",
    "the choice of mesh size is very important .",
    "when it is too small the background will be overestimated due to the presence of real sources . when it is too large , any small scale variations of the background are washed out .",
    "we ran sextractor with a mesh size set to 30 @xmath18 30 pixels , approximately 8 @xmath18 8 beams .",
    "a grey scale image of the sextractor noise map is shown in figure [ noisemap ] . as expected",
    ", the noise is lowest in the centre and increases with radial distance .",
    "the left panel of figure [ noiseprops ] shows the average noise as a function of distance from the centre .",
    "this increase in noise is roughly a parabolic shape due to the primary beam attenuation .",
    "a histogram of the noise map pixel values is shown in the right panel of figure [ noiseprops ] .",
    "this distribution peaks at a value of 10 @xmath1jy , but has a large wing at high noise values ( @xmath50jy ) due to the radially increasing noise .",
    "there are also regions of increased noise ( white pixels ) around bright sources which are clearly evident in the grey scale image ( figure [ noisemap ] ) .",
    "the increased noise around these sources is due to dynamic range effects , as discussed in paper i. the most affected region is noticeable as a high noise bump at approximately 6  arcmin from the image centre in the left panel of figure [ noiseprops ] .",
    "this corresponds to the area surrounding the brightest source ( @xmath51 = 155 mjy ) .",
    "the noise in this region is up to 3 times that of the surrounding unaffected region .",
    "although sextractor was developed for the analysis of optical data , the noise image obtained with it has been found to be reliable for radio images @xcite .",
    "we confirmed the accuracy of the sextractor noise map by comparing pixel values against rms values directly measured from our radio image .",
    "the directly measured values were obtained by selecting a set of random positions in the 1.4 ghz image and calculating the rms in the surrounding @xmath52 pixel box .",
    "each box was examined for any sources above 3@xmath53 before inclusion in the analysis to ensure that flux from real sources does not effect the statistics .",
    "figure [ noisecompare ] shows the mean and standard deviation of the difference between the sextractor pixel values and the directly measured values as a function of distance from the centre .",
    "the difference is very close to zero , and there is no systematic effect as a function of radial distance .",
    "we therefore concluded that the sextractor noise map is reliable and used it to perform the source extraction .",
    "we determined a sensible maximum radial distance for the source cataloging taking into account the following factors : + i ) the radial noise distribution , + ii ) the primary beam attenuation , and + iii ) the bandwidth smearing effect .",
    "+ these three factors determine the efficacy of detecting a source with a particular flux density at different radial distances from the centre .",
    "the primary beam response at a radial distance of 20 arcmin is approximately 39% , resulting in an increased noise of @xmath1420 @xmath1jy , compared to @xmath1410 @xmath1jy at the image centre .",
    "furthermore , the bandwidth smearing effect is 18% at this distance and rapidly degrading , as discussed in section  [ bandsmear ] . on this basis",
    "we choose to catalogue to a maximum distance of 20 arcmin from the image centre .    to begin the source extraction we divided the original 1.4 ghz map by the noise map generated by sextractor , obtaining a ` signal - to - noise ' map .",
    "sextractor is useful for obtaining signal - to - noise maps , but it has not been reliably used for extracting sources from radio images .",
    "the commonly used routines are sfind @xciteand _",
    "imsad_. although sfind may result in fewer false detections @xcite , there are no systematic differences in the source parameters found by either routine @xcite .",
    "we used the _ miriad _ task _ imsad _ to derive a preliminary list of source ` islands ' .",
    "this task searches for ` islands ' of pixels above a specified cutoff , and attempts to fit gaussian components to the ` islands ' .",
    "we executed _ imsad _ on the ` signal - to - noise ' map to detect all islands with a peak flux density level of @xmath54 .",
    "this resulted in a list of 688 source ` islands ' for further investigation .    each source",
    "` island ' found by _",
    "imsad _ was examined and refitted with an elliptical gaussian to derive source flux densities and sizes .",
    "this refitting procedure was performed on the ` real ' image ( not the ` signal - to - noise ' map ) .",
    "all sources and fit parameters were visually inspected to check for obvious failures and poor fits that need further analysis . following @xcite ,",
    "a reference peak value was derived from a second degree interpolation of the source ( _ miriad _ task _ maxfit _ ) .",
    "if the difference between the fitted peak and reference peak was less than 20% of the reference value and the fitted position was inside the 0.9@xmath55 flux density contour , then these sources were assigned a fit quality flag of 1 .",
    "gaussian integrated fluxes were also compared to the ones directly measured by summing the pixels greater than @xmath56 in the source area . in most cases",
    "the gaussian fit provided good values for the position and peak flux densities but not integrated flux densities .",
    "these sources are given a quality flag of 2 in the catalogue .",
    "there were some problematic cases which were classified as follows : + 1 ) sources fit by _ imsad _ with a single gaussian , but better described by two or more gaussians ( @xmath143% ) , and + 2 ) non gaussian sources not well fitted by a single gaussian , i.e. fit exceeds tolerance criteria described above ( @xmath140.3% ) , and + 3 ) obviously spurious sources which correspond to artefacts or noise peaks ( @xmath141% ) . in the first case above , the _ imsad _ islands were split into two or three gaussian components .",
    "the number of of successfully split islands are 19 in total ( 18 with two components , 1 with three components ) .",
    "the individual components of these sources are listed in the catalogue .",
    "the reference positions and peak flux densities from _ maxfit _ were adopted for the two non gaussian sources .",
    "the source position angle was determined by the direction along which it is most extended .",
    "the fwhm size of the axes was defined by the distance between two points on the @xmath56 contour parallel to ( major ) and perpendicular to ( minor ) this direction .",
    "these sources are flagged `` n '' in the catalogue .",
    "after accounting for the multiple components , non - gaussian sources and noise artefacts , we have a list of 693 sources , or source components .",
    "figure [ shist ] shows the peak flux density and signal - to - noise distributions of the @xmath54 sample .",
    "the spurious sources were low sn , and make up about 4% of the 4  5 @xmath57 sources .",
    "so to ensure we have a source catalogue of high reliability we apply a cut of @xmath58 , which includes 12 multiple component sources .",
    "there are clear signs of physical association between the individual components of these sources , as shown by the postage stamps in figure  [ multi_stamps ] .",
    "the final 5@xmath57 catalogue has 466 sources .",
    "the ratio of integrated flux to peak flux is a direct measure of the extension of a radio source : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are fwhm of the source axes , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 the fwhm of the synthesised beam axes .",
    "we therefore use this relation to determine whether our sources are resolved or unresolved ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : deconvplot ] we plot the ratio of the total integrated flux density ( @xmath64 ) and peak flux density ( @xmath55 ) as a function of signal - to - noise ( @xmath65 ) for all the sources in the catalogue .",
    "if the values of @xmath66 are purely due to errors introduced by noise in our image , we can derive a criterion for extension by assuming that these statistical errors are also present for @xmath67 sources .",
    "we determined the lower envelope in figure [ fig : deconvplot ] which contains 90% of the sources @xmath66 and mirrored it above the @xmath68 line .",
    "the upper envelope is characterised by the  equation  : @xmath69 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : deconv}\\ ] ] only sources lying above this upper envelope and successfully deconvolved by _",
    "miriad _ are considered resolved . from this analysis",
    "we conclude that 221/466 ( 47% ) of sources are resolved .",
    "deconvolved sizes are only given in the catalogue for resolved sources , and other sources have deconvolved sizes set to zero .",
    "radio sources can be made up of a nucleus with hot spots along , and at the end of , one or two jets .",
    "the individual components of a single source are often catalogued separately by gaussian fitting routines .",
    "this will skew number statistics , so a method must be devised to identify multiple components as belonging to a single source .",
    "similar to the technique of @xcite , we plot the sum of the fluxes of the components of each nearest neighbour pair versus their separation , as shown in figure [ nearest ] . the high density of points to the bottom right of the @xmath70-flux density plane",
    "is made up of the general population of single component sources .",
    "the pairs with a separation of about 10 arcsec are most likely subcomponents of single sources .",
    "this is evident from figure [ nearest ] where the sources which were successfully split into multiple components in section [ srcext ] , shown as circled large dots , cluster around this separation .",
    "we apply a maximum separation that increases with the summed flux density , @xmath71 : @xmath72 this maximum separation is shown as a dashed line in figure [ nearest ] . by varying the allowed separation with summed flux , bright components may be considered a single source even at large separations , while faint sources are kept as single sources .    as a further constraint",
    "we apply a flux ratio cut to the nearest neighbour pairs .",
    "since the flux densities of real double sources are correlated this gives us another criterion to restrict the matched pairs to physically associated sources .",
    "we combine pairs only if their flux densities differ by a factor less than 4 .",
    "the sources which meet this further requirement are marked in figure [ nearest ] by a large dot .",
    "for sources which lie to the left of equation [ summedfluxsep ] , 20/23 pairs with separations less than 20 arcsec pass the flux ratio cut , while only 3/21 pairs with larger separations are passed .",
    "so this procedure seems to be successful in that almost all pairs with small separation are considered single sources , while very few distant pairs are passed .    from this analysis",
    "we identify an additional 11 possible multiple sources .",

    "the parkes - mit - nrao ( pmn ) survey @xcite has a flux density limit of only 30 mjy at 4.85 ghz , while the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss , @xcite ) reaches a peak flux density limit of 6 mjy at 843 mhz .",
    "the sumss source positions are not useful as a comparison because the sumss resolution is about 45 arcsec and source positional uncertainties are up to 10 arcsec , which are much greater than the athdfs internal positional uncertainties .",
    "flux density comparisons are not possible since these two surveys are at different frequencies and there is no apriori knowledge of the source seds .",
    "the absolute positional accuracy of our survey will depend on how well the positions of the phase calibrators are known .",
    "calibrator pks b2333 - 528 has been observed by vlbi and its position in the fk5 reference system is known to within 0.005 arcsec in each coordinate @xcite .",
    "the position of the second calibrator , pks b2205 - 636 , is known to within 0.1  0.25 arcsec ( atca calibrator manual , http://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/calibrators/ ) .",
    "thus we expect the absolute accuracy of our source positions to be 0.25 arcsec . this absolute uncertainty in position",
    "is not included in the catalogue ( table [ catalogue ] ) , and needs to be added in quadrature to the source positional uncertainty .",
    "this affects mainly the brighter sources , as the positional uncertainty of sources with signal - to - noise less than 10 are dominated by the internal accuracy of our survey .",
    "in the athdfs , sources were included in the catalogue if the measured peak flux density exceeded five times the local noise .",
    "this can lead to incompleteness at faint flux density levels , which has to be taken into account when deriving source counts . in this section",
    "we discuss the various possible sources of incompleteness in the source catalogue .",
    "any source extraction method that relies on the ratio of peak flux density to the local noise will be affected by the variation of noise in the image .",
    "the area over which a source of a given flux density can be detected , also known as the visibility area , depends on the source peak flux density and the homogeneity of the noise distribution .",
    "the noise in our image is 11.0 @xmath1jy at the centre and is a function of the primary beam response , increasing towards the edges of the field , as quantified in section [ sec : noiseim ] .",
    "local variation in image noise is also caused by bright sources , which can increase the noise in its vicinity by up to 3 times that of an unaffected region ( see section [ sec : noiseim ] for details ) .",
    "the visibility area of the athdfs 1.4 ghz image is shown in figure [ visfig ] . as expected",
    ", the fraction of the total area over which a source of a given peak flux density can be detected increases between 0.05 and 0.1 mjy , and reaches 0.96 at 0.1 mjy .",
    "the rise in the visibility function is not as rapid as in the atesp @xcite or virmos @xcite surveys .",
    "this is because these surveys used a mosaicing technique , which results in a more uniform noise distribution than single - pointing surveys such as the athdfs .",
    "the visibility area also shows that sources with a peak flux density greater than 0.1 mjy can be detected over more than 95% of the whole image .",
    "the visibility area reaches 100% of the image at a peak flux density of 0.23 mjy .",
    "two additional effects which could be responsible for partial incompleteness in the source catalogue are bandwidth smearing and clean bias .",
    "these two effects have been extensively discussed in section [ imageanalysis ] .",
    "bandwidth smearing can lead to an underestimation of peak flux densities by up to @xmath1418% , although the amount is 5% or less for the majority of our sources .",
    "the clean bias affects both peak and integrated flux densities .",
    "it leads to an underestimation of flux densities by @xmath145% for the faintest sources ( 5@xmath53 ) , but has no effect on sources brighter than 10@xmath53 .    in section [ imageanalysis ]",
    "we proposed a formula ( equation a1 ) to correct the measured peak and integrated flux densities for these two systematic effects .",
    "the correction depends on the source signal - to - noise ratio as well as the source distance from the image centre .",
    "however , peak flux densities are underestimated by @xmath1423% _ at most _ due to the combined effects of both clean bias and bandwidth smearing .",
    "since the highest level of noise is @xmath1450 @xmath1jy , it follows that clean bias and bandwidth smearing do not affect sources brighter than @xmath81 mjy .",
    "resolution bias is an effect in which weak extended sources may have peak flux densities that fall below the catalogued 5@xmath57 limit , yet still have total integrated flux densities above the survey limit . to derive a source count that is complete in terms of total flux density",
    ", the number of `` missing '' sources has to be estimated . given a maximum detectable angular size and knowledge of the intrinsic source size distribution as a function of flux density , this so called resolution bias can be corrected . here",
    "we follow the procedures of @xcite to correct the resolution bias .    assuming a gaussian beam , the maximum size ( @xmath82 ) a source of total flux density @xmath71 can have before it drops below the @xmath83 detection limit can be calculated from the equation : @xmath84 in figure [ thetalims ] we plot the angular size ( @xmath70 ) of the athdfs sources as a function of the measured total flux density .",
    "the angular sizes are defined as the geometric mean of the major and minor deconvolved axes of the sources .",
    "we assume @xmath85 for point sources .",
    "we calculate @xmath82 from equation [ thetamaxfn ] with a full range of noise values from 5 to 30 @xmath1jy .",
    "the distribution of pixel values in the noise image of section [ sec : noiseim ] is used to determine the relative weight of each noise value and a weighted average @xmath82 is calculated .",
    "figure [ thetalims ] shows that the angular sizes of the largest athdfs sources are in good agreement with this weighted average @xmath86 function .    as discussed in [ sec : decon ] , the deconvolution efficiency depends on the signal - to - noise of a source .",
    "an estimate of the minimum angular size ( @xmath87 ) that a source can have is derived from equations [ eq : fluxtheta ] and [ eq : deconv ] : @xmath88 = \\frac{\\theta_{\\rm min}^2}{b_{\\rm maj}b_{\\rm min}}\\ ] ] similar to the derivation of @xmath82 , a weighted average @xmath89 is calculated using the noise distribution of our image .",
    "the resulting average @xmath89 is plotted in figure [ thetalims ] as a dashed line .",
    "we note that the @xmath89 constraint is important at low flux density levels where @xmath82 becomes unphysical ( @xmath900 ) .",
    "also , the minimum deconvolved size is about 10  at the detection limit , whereas sources as small as @xmath141  are reliably deconvolved at higher signal - to - noise .    using the two constraints described above",
    ", an overall angular size upper limit , @xmath91 , as a function of flux density @xmath71 is defined as : @xmath92 the incompleteness of the athdfs survey due to @xmath91 can be estimated with knowledge of the true source angular size distribution as a function of flux density .",
    "we assume an exponential form for the integral angular size distribution , @xmath93 @xcite : @xmath94 with @xmath95 where @xmath96 is in mjy , and @xmath97 is the estimated median source size at a given flux density .",
    "equations [ windeq1 ] and [ windeq2 ] together with equation [ thetalimeq ] allow us to estimate the fraction of sources larger than the maximum detectable size and therefore missed by our survey .",
    "the correction factor , @xmath98 , is then simply calculated as : @xmath99 in figure [ rescorrfig ] we show both @xmath93 ( left panel ) and @xmath98 ( right panel ) .",
    "the resolution bias peaks at about 0.1 mjy , but decreases at lower flux densities due to the @xmath89 constraint .",
    "in this section , we construct the differential radio source counts from the @xmath58 athdfs catalogue . in computing the source",
    "counts we have used the integrated flux density for resolved sources and peak flux densities for point sources .",
    "the counts were calculated by dividing the number of sources in each flux density bin by the total survey area and the bin width , and then normalising by the euclidean slope of @xmath100 .",
    "the reason for the normalisation is historical , relating to the early use of radio source counts to test various cosmological models against the number of sources that would be expected in a steady state euclidean universe @xcite .",
    "table [ countstable ] lists the final athdfs source counts , corrected for the visibility area , clean bias , bandwidth smearing and resolution bias as discussed above . for each flux density bin , the mean flux density ( @xmath11@xmath101@xmath102 ) , the number of detected sources ( @xmath103 ) , the number of effective sources after applying the corrections ( @xmath104 ) , and the corrected normalised differential radio source count ( @xmath105 ) , are given .",
    "we show the counts before and after corrections in figure [ athdfscounts1 ] .",
    "we notice that the corrections are most important in the flux density range 0.09  0.3 mjy , where they can increase the source count by up to approximately 30% .",
    "sources classed as `` multiple - component '' ( see section 4.4 ) only make one contribution to the source count . at these flux density levels ,",
    "the difference between incorporating `` multiple - component '' sources as single objects and deriving counts from the `` full component '' catalogue is negligible .",
    "if all components are used , then the most significant change is in the @xmath11@xmath101@xmath102=0.119 mjy bin , where there are 4 additional sources . for this bin",
    "the difference is @xmath14 7% , which is less than the poisson error .",
    "the athdfs source counts are compared to those derived from other 1.4 ghz surveys in figure [ athdfscounts2 ] .",
    "the source counts from the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres survey ( first , @xcite ) are shown , as well as counts from the atesp survey @xcite , phoenix deep field ( pdf , @xcite ) and hubble deep field north ( hdfn , @xcite ) . the solid line in figure [ athdfscounts2 ] is the linear least squares sixth order polynomial fit to this compilation of source counts",
    ". first counts below 2.5 mjy , were removed from the fit since first is incomplete at this limit .",
    "pdf counts above 2.5 mjy and atesp counts above 76 mjy were also excluded from the fit since the sampling is sparse in the higher flux density bins of these surveys .",
    "the resulting polynomial fit is given by : @xmath106 = \\sum_{i=0}^{6 } a_i(\\log[s/{\\rm mjy}])^i,\\ ] ] with @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "for comparison , a third order fit to source counts from 0.1 mjy to 10000 mjy by @xcite and a sixth order fit by @xcite to the pdf and first source counts between 0.06 mjy and 1 mjy are shown as dashed and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "a third order polynomial is insufficient to account for the curvature below 0.1 mjy suggested by both the hdfn and pdf surveys .",
    "a fourth order polynomial does not adequately model the point of inflection around 0.5 mjy @xcite , while fifth order polynomials do not reproduce the concave curvature seen at about 1 jy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence the sixth order polynomial is necessary .",
    "the fitted polynomial has no physical basis , but is useful in quantifying the differential radio source count .",
    "there is a high level of consistency between the source counts derived from both small and large area surveys at flux densities @xmath114 0.5 mjy ( figures 19 and 20 ) .",
    "the differential source counts diverge at fainter flux density levels ( @xmath115 0.5 mjy ) the source count from the hdfn has been previously noted as being particularly low because of inadequate completeness corrections , as well as cosmic variance @xcite . in contrast , the count from the athdfs lies _ higher _ than all other counts at @xmath116 0.4 mjy , although within statistical agreement for @xmath115 0.3 mjy .",
    "the excess is significant for the athdfs at 0.37 mjy @xmath117 0.47 mjy compared to the latest ( 2003 ) pdf results and the counts from the virmos survey . over the 0.35 deg@xmath13 area catalogued by the athdfs survey",
    ", we have 22 sources in this flux density range , compared to 44 in the virmos field ( 1 deg@xmath13 ) and 150 in the latest pdf catalogue ( 4.5 deg@xmath13 ) .",
    "we attribute the variation in the athdfs as real given the small area of the athdfs , with a probable over density of @xmath14 3  8 sources compared to the average field .    at the very faintest limits ( @xmath115 0.1 mjy )",
    "it has been suggested that the differential source count steepens towards lower flux density limits @xcite .",
    "although there is little real confirmation , as in every case it relies on the faintest source count bin , this steepening is expected as the flat region of the count between 0.08 and 0.3 mjy can not continue infinitely because the implied surface density of radio sources would exceed the number of host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the differential count from the athdfs is in agreement with the general trend around @xmath101 = 0.08 mjy , although the last data point at 0.059 mjy lies well above those from the hdfn and pdf .",
    "thus we can not confirm the down - turn in the differential radio source count , and will have to wait for a deeper source catalogue to supply this data .",
    "source counts are important because they can be used to constrain the evolution of the radio population .",
    "the source count above 10 mjy is dominated by giant radio galaxies and qsos , which we group together in this discussion as agn . at sub - mjy levels ( 0.1  1 mjy )",
    "there is an increasing number of blue galaxies with starforming spectral signatures .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others have concluded that the source count at these faintest levels requires two populations , agn and starforming galaxies , both of which undergo strong evolution .    to derive a local luminosity function of starforming galaxies , @xcite start with the iras 60@xmath118 luminosity function @xcite and convert that to radio using the well - known fir - radio correlation @xcite . assuming that luminosity evolves as @xmath119",
    ", @xcite found @xmath120 best matches the radio source counts .",
    "we perform a similar test to determine the rate of evolution of the local starforming galaxies required to match the radio source counts .",
    "we use the local radio luminosity function of starforming galaxies determined by @xcite for the 4583 uppsala galaxy catalogue ( ugc , @xcite ) galaxies crossmatched with the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , @xcite ) .",

    "for the agn component we use the agn counts from @xcite .",
    "the observed source count is shown in figure [ count_evolve ] along with several models for the counts of the local starforming population .",
    "we have explored a variety of evolution scenarios : pure luminosity evolution going as @xmath129 , pure density evolution going as @xmath130 , and a no evolution model .",
    "we confirm that two distinct populations , the starforming galaxies and agn , are required to account for the faint source counts .",
    "the counts are best fit by starforming galaxies undergoing @xmath131 luminosity evolution .",
    "this amount of evolution means the number of starforming galaxies exceeds the number of agn at about 0.25 mjy .",
    "the counts rule out stronger luminosity evolution of @xmath132 .",
    "a modest amount of density evolution is also allowed , but if it is large ( e.g. @xmath133 ) the source counts are too high at the @xmath1jy level . a downturn in radio source counts",
    "is needed at these levels so that the number of radio sources do nt exceed the number of host galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , the radio source counts rule out large amounts of density evolution in the starforming galaxy population .",
    "similar values for the evolution of star forming galaxies have been found by @xcite and @xcite , who find @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "these two studies use the local radio luminosity function of starforming galaxies from @xcite . despite different assumptions for the luminosity functions of both starforming and agn galaxies",

    "we have corrected the counts for survey completeness and systematic effects , including visibility area , clean bias , bandwidth smearing and resolution bias .",
    "we find that the source counts in the athdfs are in general consistent with that from previous surveys , although the athdfs counts are greater than that found in the the hdfn by a factor of 1.2  2 .",
    "other deep surveys have also found the hdfn counts to be low ( e.g. phoenix , @xcite ; virmos , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the hdfn counts are probably underestimated , or the hdfn samples a relatively under - dense region of radio sources .",
    "we find the radio source counts are best fit by the local starforming population with luminosity evolution of the form @xmath131 , although small amounts of density evolution are not ruled out .",
