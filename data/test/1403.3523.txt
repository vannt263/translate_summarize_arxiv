    "ever since the discovery of the geometrical phase accompanying adiabatic driving in quantum systems @xcite , the role that geometric quantities play in many physical phenomena has been in the focus of intense research @xcite . by geometric quantities",
    "we mean here quantities which are determined solely by the geometry of the path drawn by the changing driving parameters .",
    "the berry phase is one such quantity : as a quantum system is adiabatically transported along a closed cycle in the space of the driving parameters , its wave function accumulates a phase @xmath1 which depends only on the geometry of the cycle . in particular",
    ", @xmath1 is the line integral of a vector field ( the berry connection ) over the closed path in the parameter space .",
    "geometric quantities are indeed common in other branches of physics besides quantum mechanics , and all can be expressed as the line integral of some vector field .",
    "the most prominent example is the work output @xmath2 per cycle of a thermodynamic engine @xcite .",
    "this is perhaps the simplest example of a geometric pump , namely , a system that adiabatically converts an ac driving into a dc current ( not to be confused with rectification ) . like the thermodynamic engine , any geometric pump is fully characterized by a vector field @xmath3 , which we shall call the pumping field .",
    "adiabatic pumps are currently in the limelight of topical experimental and theoretical research .",
    "stochastic pumps  @xcite , whose mechanisms underlie , e.g. , the functioning of brownian motors  @xcite , or heat pumps  @xcite are important examples",
    ". quantum charge pumps  @xcite , based on the adiabatic manipulation of coherent devices , are another exciting avenue of research of this kind , also in view of their application to metrology  @xcite . since the pioneering paper by thouless  @xcite many aspects of adiabatic pumping have been elucidated .",
    "an incomplete list includes the scattering theory of ( charge , spin , heat ) pumping  @xcite , its extension to include electron - electron interaction  @xcite , the theory of cooper - pair pumping in superconducting nanocircuits  @xcite , and topological pumping  @xcite .",
    "along with this intense theoretical activity , a number of important experiments have been successfully performed  @xcite . in all these cases",
    ", dissipation plays an unavoidable , possibly constructive role , whose features are yet to be fully understood .",
    "this motivated a renewed interest in studying the combined effects of noise and driving @xcite in the context of adiabatic quantum transport @xcite .",
    "all those prior attempts attacked the problem by solving the reduced dynamics of the slowly driven open quantum system within some approximation scheme appropriate to each specific physical case .",
    "this gives the reduced density matrix @xmath4 , which is used to calculate the instantaneous current @xmath5 , and by time integration the total pumped charge , out of which one has to single out the geometric contribution .",
    "here we pursue instead _ a geometric approach _ to calculate the pumping field @xmath3 giving the geometrically pumped charge directly .",
    "our approach is based on the salient observation that , independent of the specific physical scenario , @xmath3 is in fact the vector of linear response coefficients in the adiabatic expansion of the current [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : taylor ] ) below ] . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this result was never exploited before in the context of dissipative quantum pumping .",
    "it brings about two main advantages : ( i ) when applied to an open quantum system , it leads to an exact expression of @xmath0 in terms of equilibrium quantum correlation functions , which are calculated at frozen driving parameters .",
    "that is , our scheme makes evident that solving the _ reduced _ dynamics of an undriven system suffices .",
    "( ii ) since @xmath3 characterizes the geometric pumping fully , once one knows it , calculating the charge pumped along any cycle is as simple as doing a line integral .",
    "besides , the curl @xmath6 provides immediate visual information about the geometric features associated to dissipative pumping .",
    "these unveil the possibility of many previously undetected dissipation - assisted operation protocols .",
    "see our cooper - pair sluice example below .",
    "our expression of the pumping field [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) ] can be used in a wide range of cases of experimental interest , ranging from electron pumps based on quantum dots to cooper - pair pumps in superconducting devices .",
    "we illustrate the method in the latter case . to this end",
    "we pursue here the derivation of a specific equation of motion ( eom ) for the calculation of equilibrium quantum correlation functions at fixed driving parameters under the sole assumption of weak coupling to a bosonic bath .",
    "we emphasize that the eom neither rests on a markov nor a rotating wave approximation .",
    "consider a generic geometric pump , namely , a physical device that can be externally manipulated by several control parameters @xmath7 and supports the flow of a current @xmath8 .",
    "we are interested in the `` charge '' @xmath9 that is transported by the device as the parameters draw a closed path @xmath10 in the parameter space .",
    "the symbol @xmath11 denotes the time duration of the cycle . in general",
    ", the transported charge has a geometric contribution .",
    "the key to singling out the geometric component of the transported charge is to perform an `` adiabatic expansion '' of the current at any generic time @xmath12 , namely , a taylor expansion of the current @xmath8 in terms of the rate of change @xmath13 of the parameters : @xmath14 where the coefficients @xmath15 are functions of the value @xmath16 taken by the parameters at time @xmath12 .",
    "accordingly , the transported charge is given by @xmath17 the zeroth - order term is what is customarily referred to as the dynamical charge .",
    "it is due to the fact that charge could possibly flow even at fixed parameters @xcite .",
    "note that the dynamical charge depends very strongly on the duration of the cycle : the same cycle operated at half the speed would result in twice the dynamic charge .",
    "the first - order term , in contrast , is geometric , because @xmath18 depends only on the geometry of the path . on the contrary ,",
    "the higher - order terms are not geometric , because the change of variable @xmath19 would not suffice to remove the explicit @xmath13 dependence of their integrands .",
    "thus the full geometric contribution to the transported charge @xmath20 is exactly and solely given by @xmath21 with @xmath0 the vector of adiabatic linear response coefficients , and @xmath6 its curl .",
    "( the double integral is a surface integral over any surface having @xmath10 as its contour , i.e. , the stokes theorem . )",
    ", @xmath22 are separated by a superconducting island ( green ) whose polarization charge @xmath23 is externally controlled by the gate voltage @xmath24 .",
    "the resistor ( blue ) represents environmental gate noise of thermal energy @xmath25 . the threading magnetic flux @xmath26 fixes the overall phase difference @xmath27 across the sluice .",
    "right panel : typical driving path used in experiments @xcite . ]    as an application of timely interest , we consider the cooper - pair sluice @xcite sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sluice ] .",
    "the sluice consists of two superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) separated by a superconducting island .",
    "the system is phase biased , with the phase difference @xmath27 .",
    "the two squids with respective josephson couplings @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be independently manipulated by controlling the magnetic flux threading each of them , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the island is further capacitively coupled to a gate electrode controlling its polarization charge in units of cooper pairs @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the gate capacitance , @xmath34 is the electron s charge , and @xmath24 is the applied gate voltage .",
    "the three driving parameters in this case are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the charging energy of the island .",
    "we assume the sluice is operated in the regime where the charging energy @xmath38 is much larger than @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in this regime",
    "the sluice can be conveniently modeled as a tunable two - level system . in the basis of charge states @xmath39 ,",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath40 , with @xmath41/2 $ ] , @xmath42/2 $ ] , and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 are the pauli matrices ) .",
    "the charge flowing through the sluice is associated to the current operator @xcite @xmath45 the sluice is subject to thermal noise at temperature @xmath46 coming from the voltage gate .",
    "depending on the time scale @xmath47 , there are two distinct adiabatic regimes : the coherent regime and the dissipative regime @xcite .",
    "the first is relevant when the driving time @xmath47 is very short compared to the thermal relaxation and decoherence times but long compared to the transition times @xmath48 .",
    "accordingly , one performs an adiabatic expansion around the eigenstate @xmath49 ( as in @xcite ) , and the pumping field emerges as @xmath50 for the cooper pair sluice working close to the ground state , we obtain , for its curl , the following analytical result : @xmath51 notice that @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the ground - state berry curvature @xcite .    in the case when the driving time @xmath47 is very short compared to the thermal - relaxation time , instead , the reference state around which the expansion is performed is the instantaneous thermal state @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the partition function and @xmath56 the total hamiltonian , sum of system , environment , and coupling hamiltonians , respectively . the adiabatic linear response theory developed in ref .",
    "@xcite gives then @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and the subscripts of @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote that these operators are considered in the heisenberg representation generated by the full hamiltonian ( [ totalh ] ) ( with fixed @xmath16 ) at the times @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "note that , as anticipated , the correlation functions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) are evaluated at fixed @xmath16 .",
    "clearly , their evaluation does not involve the solution of a driven open - system dynamics . the expression ( [ eq : f ] )",
    "is exact and approximations enter only at the point of evaluating it .",
    "below we present our original method for its calculation .",
    "we emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) can not be obtained within the common reduced density matrix approach @xcite , because the sole , single - time , reduced density matrix operator does not suffice for the exact evaluation of two - time quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "we model the thermal environment of the sluice as a set of harmonic oscillators @xcite : @xmath64 here @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , are the oscillators positions , momenta , masses , and frequency , respectively , @xmath69 is a system operator , and @xmath70 is an environment operator .",
    "the evaluation of the field @xmath71 in ( 7 ) involves evaluating the equilibrium quantum correlation function at various , but fixed , parameter values @xmath16 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath16 comes from the parametric dependence of the total hamiltonian @xmath72 on @xmath16 . to this end",

    "the most apparent is the emergence of an asymmetry of @xmath140 under @xmath141 , in the dissipative regime as opposed to the coherent regime .",

    "we shall recall that the force response @xmath149 is composed of two terms : the friction @xmath150 and a geometric magnetism @xmath151 @xcite : @xmath152 , respectively given by the symmetric and antisymmetric component of the conductance matrix , @xmath153 , according to the formulas @xmath154 , @xmath155 [ where @xmath156 is the levi - civita symbol and @xmath157 .",

    "this in turn allows us to quantify the fractions of pumped charge due to geometric magnetism and friction , respectively .",
