    "the crab nebula pulsar ( b0531 + 21 ) intermittently produces single pulses having intensity orders of magnitude greater than those of the normal periodic emission @xcite .",
    "these giant pulses ( gps ) consist of complex superpositions of nanosecond- and microsecond - scale impulses @xcite and have been observed over many octaves of the radio spectrum @xcite .",
    "the details of the gp emission mechanism remain mysterious . because the intrinsic duration of crab gps is much less than the pulse broadening due to the host nebula and the interstellar medium ( ism ) along the line of sight , crab gps are also potentially of great value as a probe of the electron density of those regions .",
    "studies of crab gps are often limited to frequencies above 100  mhz where the emission is relatively strong and/or existing large radio telescopes are available ; see for example @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "studies of crab gps below 100  mhz have historically been limited by the lack of suitable large telescopes and the difficulties imposed by strong and diverse radio frequency interference ( rfi ) at these frequencies .",
    "observations of crab gps have been reported at 40 and 60  mhz by @xcite and more recently at 23  mhz by @xcite .",
    "a search of 14 hours of data collected in a 2.5  mhz bandwidth around 38 mhz by the 10-dipole eight meter - wavelength transient array ( eta ) experiment revealed 11 gp candidates , but these proved difficult to confirm due to the low sensitivity ( @xmath2 for the strongest pulse candidate of @xmath3  kjy ) and difficulties with rfi @xcite .",
    "detection of crab gps by lofar in the frequency ranges 3280  mhz and 139187  mhz has been reported but further details are not provided @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report the detection and characterization of crab gps in the frequency range 2084  mhz by the recently - completed long wavelength array station  1 ( lwa1 ) radio telescope .",
    "lwa1 consists of a pseudorandom array of 256  dual - polarized broadband dipoles within a 110  m @xmath4 100  m elliptical footprint ,  m from the center of the array and are used for array calibration and power spectrum measurement . ] and is capable of nyquist - rate acquisition of beam outputs covering its entire tuning range of 10 - 88  mhz simultaneously .",
    "this facilitates high - signal - to - noise ratio detection of crab gps at a rate of several per hour ; also , the large instantaneous bandwidth provides the ability to study variations in flux density and pulse broadening with frequency on a pulse - by - pulse basis .",
    "the large bandwidth also facilitates improved methods for the recognition and mitigation of the effects of rfi .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sida ] describes lwa1 and the methods used for data collection , data reduction , identification of crab gps , pulse characterization , and flux density calibration .",
    "section  [ sresults ] summarizes the findings of the study including statistics of pulse amplitude and pulse broadening .",
    "section  [ sdisc ] includes a brief description of ongoing and planned follow - up work .",
    "lwa1 is collocated with the very large array ( vla ; @xmath5  w , @xmath6  n ) in central new mexico .",
    "the telescope consists of a primary array of 256 pairs of dipole - type antennas whose outputs are individually digitized and formed into beams .",
    "a detailed technical description of the instrument , including performance characterization , can be found in @xcite .",
    "lwa1 provides 4 independently - steerable dual - polarization beams .",
    "each beam provides two separate passbands with independently - selectable center frequencies .",
    "each passband consists of nyquist - rate time - domain output at sample rates up 19.6 million samples per second ( msps ) per passband with @xmath7  mhz usable bandwidth , in 4-bits real ( `` i '' ) plus 4-bits imaginary ( `` q '' ) format .",
    "the beam main lobe width varies with frequency and pointing direction , but ranges from about @xmath8 full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) at @xmath9  mhz to about @xmath10 fwhm at @xmath11  mhz for observations of the crab pulsar within about 1 hour of upper culmination .",
    "the system equivalent flux density ( sefd ) varies as a function of frequency , pointing relative to zenith , and ( because the system temperature is strongly dominated by galactic noise ) pointing in celestial coordinates .",
    "sefd estimates for the flux density calibration specific to the present work are developed in section  [ sfc ] ; however sefd is typically found to be in the range 617  kjy for high - elevation pointings over most of the frequency range .",
    "frequency range can be understood by noting that the collecting area of a dipole decreases as the square of frequency , whereas the galactic noise - dominated antenna temperature decreases with frequency at about the same rate . ]",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath12 sensitivity @xmath13  jy assuming both polarizations , 17  mhz bandwidth , and 25  ms integration",
    ".    a description of lwa1 early science results ( including first pulsar observations ) can be found in @xcite . to date",
    "lwa1 has detected 13 known pulsars and has several on - going programs dedicated to survey , monitoring , and characterization of pulsars @xcite .",
    "data for the present work were collected in 10 1-hr observations in fall 2012 , each centered on the transit of the crab pulsar , as detailed in table  [ tobs ] . in each observation , two beams were used together to track the pulsar ( i.e. , both beams pointing in precisely the same direction ) .",
    "the center frequencies of the passbands of the first beam were 76  mhz and 60  mhz , whereas the center frequencies for the second beam were 44  mhz and 28  mhz .",
    "since the usable bandwidth is @xmath14  mhz per passband , this scheme yields contiguous frequency coverage from 20  mhz to 84  mhz .",
    "the total volume of data collected in this fashion was @xmath15  tb ; relatively large since the data are recorded as raw voltage streams without channelization or other `` on the fly '' processing .",
    "this format provides the maximum flexibility for both initial processing and subsequent reprocessing of the data at later time using other search parameters or techniques .",
    "although the instrument is capable of tracking sources to very low elevation angles , we have restricted the observations to 1 hour each day around upper culmination in order to ( 1 ) limit the extent to which change in the beam characteristics over the track can manifest as variations in estimated flux density , ( 2 ) distribute the observations more evenly over the expected range of source conditions , and ( 3 ) reduce the tempo of data acquisition to a manageable pace . concerning ( 2 ) , a parameter of interest in the present work that is known to vary significantly over timescales of weeks to months is pulse broadening @xcite ; in fact , such variations can occur even on timescales of minutes @xcite .",
    "because this study involved the use of a new instrument and new data analysis procedures , we performed simultaneous observations of the bright pulsar b0329 + 54 using the remaining two beams , using the same synchronized - tracking four - passband scheme employed for crab gp observing .",
    "this allowed an independent check of the instrument and data reduction procedures using a well - known object , as well as providing an `` off pointing '' ( separated by @xmath16  h in right ascension ) for confirmation of crab gp detections as well as for identification of rfi through anticoincidence techniques .",
    "the data were analyzed using custom incoherent dedispersion software developed by one of us ( s.e . ) , designed specifically for rapid analysis of periodic and single - pulse emission of dispersed astrophysical signals in raw lwa1 beam data .",
    "the steps in data reduction for one passband of one beam were as follows : first , any samples having @xmath17 ( that is , the magnitude of the complex - valued sample equal to or greater than maximum encodable real or imaginary magnitude ) were assumed to be due to rfi and set to zero ; typically 0.1% to 1% of samples were zeroed in this process .",
    "next , data were partitioned into blocks of length @xmath18 ( center frequency - dependent ) and divided into channels using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "values of @xmath18 and the associated time and frequency resolutions are shown in table  [ tfft ] .",
    "these values were chosen to make the residual dispersion negligible relative to the width of the scatter - broadened pulse after incoherent dedispersion .",
    "the raw linear polarizations were incoherently combined at this point .",
    "time - frequency pixels associated with the outer 10% of frequency channels were discarded and the inner 90% were `` flattened '' ; that is , variations in frequency and time ( attributable to the instrument or to ionospheric effects ) within the time span of the spectrogram ( typically 1050  s ) were removed . finally , all pixels in frequency bands containing persistent rfi , or rfi which was intermittent but frequently observed , were discarded ; additional details about this procedure are given in section  [ sigp ] .",
    "in addition to the amplitude variation , the ionosphere imparts both refraction and dispersion to received signals . for the purposes of the present work",
    ", these additional effects are negligible and may be safely ignored : the worst - case ionospheric refraction is on the order of arcminutes ( see e.g. @xcite ) and thus is a tiny fraction of the narrowest beam width in the present work .",
    "the worst - case ionospheric contribution to the total dispersive delay over 2084  mhz is @xmath19  ms @xcite , corresponding to an apparent error in dispersion measure ( dm ) @xmath20  pc  @xmath21 .",
    "this is at least two orders of magnitude less than the error in assumed dm used for dedispersion , which is described below and shown to be insignificant .",
    "following rfi mitigation , the result was incoherently dedispersed assuming dm @xmath22 56.791 pc  @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "although coherent dedispersion would be preferable from a sensitivity perspective , the residual dispersion after application of incoherent dedispersion at the time - frequency resolutions identified above is less than than the observed width of the scatter - broadened pulses by more than two orders of magnitude ; thus the penalty in the present work is negligible .",
    "in addition to having a large advantage in terms of computation burden , the frequency - domain interference mitigation procedure described below ( section  [ sigp ] ) is easily implemented in the incoherent dedispersion framework , but much less straightforward to implement as part of a coherent dedispersion scheme .",
    "the dedispersed time series was averaged to obtain an integration time and effective time resolution of approximately 25  ms for the 76  mhz and 60  mhz passbands , and either 33  ms or 50  ms for the 44  mhz and 28  mhz passbands .",
    "note that there is no subsequent adjustment to the assumed dm of 56.791  pc  @xmath21 in our processing .",
    "in particular , we did not perform a search over dm . as explained in section  [ spb ] , refinement of the dm",
    "used for dedispersion proves to be unnecessary because the resulting bias in estimated pulse parameters turns out to be negligible .",
    "the products saved from this procedure were ( 1 ) the dedispersed and averaged time series , and ( 2 ) the associated spectrogram , which was further averaged to a time - frequency resolution of approximately 5  khz @xmath4 100  ms .",
    "a representative spectrogram is shown in figure  [ fnicepulse ] .",
    "the spectrograms play an important role in data interpretation , as explained below .    in observing sessions where we simultaneously observed b0329 + 54 , we repeated the above procedure in all details , except for the dm ( 26.833  pc  @xmath21 ) and we took the additional step of folding the resulting time series at the known period ( @xmath23  s ) @xcite . in each case",
    "we detected the pulsar in all four passbands with high signal - to - noise ratio , giving confidence in the new instrumentation and data analysis procedures .",
    "furthermore we confirmed that gps detected in the beams pointing to b0531 + 21 were absent from the beams pointing to b0329 + 54 , as expected .",
    "traditional methods for identification of gps involve matched filtering of the time series , typically with iteration over dm in order to confirm that detected pulses are in fact crab gps .",
    "a straightforward application of this procedure is not robust for the present work , for several reasons .",
    "first , ionospheric scintillation results in variations that can vary by as much as 10% of the system temperature with characteristic time scales on the order of minutes .",
    "this frequently results in large variations in the noise baseline of the time series , and occurs on time scales roughly equal to or less than the time it takes for the `` chirp '' waveform of the dispersed pulse to traverse the passband .",
    "furthermore , gps in this frequency range remain scatter - broadened to durations on scales of 1001000  ms after dedispersion .",
    "this tends to make matched filter detection procedures that assume canonical pulse shapes with time - invariant noise baselines unreliable and frustrating to use , especially in the presence of impulsive rfi .",
    "furthermore , impulsive rfi is ubiquitous in this frequency range . in particular",
    ", we have found that signals from terrestrial television transmitters in the frequency range 5487 mhz are a serious problem .",
    "transmissions in both the modern digital `` atsc '' format currently in widespread use in the u.s . , as well as transmissions in the legacy analog `` ntsc '' format , are routinely found in lwa1 data .",
    "atsc signals are recognizable as emissions having 6 mhz instantaneous bandwidth , whereas ntsc signals are recognizable as relatively narrowband video and audio carriers separated by 4.5  mhz . with the exception of a persistent ntsc video carrier seen at 55.25  mhz ( associated with a station in mexico ) ,",
    "these emissions are usually not seen as continuous transmissions , but rather in bursts with durations on the order of milliseconds to seconds .",
    "these bursts are believed to be due to reflections from ionized meteor trails and low earth orbiting satellites , as opposed to reflection from aircraft or the ionosphere .",
    "these emissions have two particularly irritating features from the perspective of searching for single dispersed pulses : ( 1 ) they frequently exhibit the same `` reverse ramp '' waveform expected of scatter - broadened pulses , and with similar durations , and ( 2 ) because they are narrowband relative to the overall bandwidth , they are often not significantly suppressed by the process of dedispersion  they are simply translated in time and ( in the case of atsc flares ) also `` smeared '' in time .    excluding bandwidths of 1.0 and 0.5  mhz around frequencies of ntsc video and audio carriers ( respectively )",
    "dramatically improves  but does not eliminate  the ntsc problem . specifically , strong ntsc flares occasionally `` overrun '' the excluded frequency ranges .",
    "atsc flares can not be effectively mitigated by frequency blanking without removing the entire 6  mhz bandwidth of the emission .",
    "reducing the effect of ntsc and atsc flares to a negligible level by frequency - domain blanking requires eliminating an unacceptable amount of otherwise - usable bandwidth .",
    "because the flares occur with relatively small overall duty cycle , an automated joint time - frequency blanking scheme probably would be acceptable ; however , this requires significant software development and has not yet been implemented .",
    "at present , we find that the most practical and robust method for detection of crab gps in our frequency range is as follows : first , we manually search the spectrograms for each passband for the characteristic `` chirp '' of a crab gp which is visible over most of the passband .",
    "figure  [ fnicepulse ] shows an example .",
    "we then confirm the presence of the distinctive broadened pulse waveform at the appropriate time in the dedispersed time series .",
    "typically  but not always  pulses are first detected in the 76  mhz or 60  mhz passbands ; this is because the pulse broadening is less severe , and because pulse flux density in this range of frequencies generally increases with increasing frequency @xcite .",
    "the dedispersed time series for the other passbands is then also checked , accounting for the expected dispersion delay which is tens to hundreds of seconds due to the large fractional bandwidth between passbands .",
    "the first 10 or so gps that we detected using this approach were subsequently independently confirmed by repeating the procedure while sweeping in dm .",
    "we soon realized that that this computationally - expensive procedure was not necessary for the present work , since simpler procedure of detecting pulses through spectrograms and/or appearance in multiple passbands with the expected dispersion delay yielded a false alarm rate of zero , whereas the results of dm sweeps were frequently difficult to interpret due to the effects of the ionosphere and impulsive rfi , as discussed above .",
    "a possible disadvantage of this detection procedure is somewhat reduced sensitivity .",
    "manual inspection of dedispersed time series reveals many pulse candidates which are quite likely to be crab gps , but which are not visible in spectrograms and/or ambiguous or non - detections in the dedispersed time series for other passbands .",
    "we suspect refinements to the above procedures can increase the rate at which gps are detected by a factor of 23 at least . for this initial work , however , we prefer a simpler and more conservative approach . furthermore ( as discussed in section  [ spc ] ) , we shall apply an even more stringent criterion of s / n @xmath24 for the peak flux density .",
    "several candidate gps detected using the above procedure failed this criterion , indicating that the sensitivity penalty is actually not unusually severe in comparison to search procedures ( including fully - automated techniques ) employed by others ; e.g. @xcite and @xcite .    finally , we note that frequencies below 54  mhz down to the lowest frequency considered in this study ( @xmath25  mhz ) exhibit relatively sparse and low levels of anthropogenic rfi during local hours of darkness , when all of our observations were conducted .",
    "we found that no frequency blanking was required for the 28  mhz passband , and only 0.2  mhz was blanked in the 44  mhz passband ( to remove a persistent tone  possibly locally generated  at 48.0  mhz ) .",
    "ironically , ionospheric scintillation is significantly worse at the lower frequencies ; in some cases the resulting variations in the noise baseline were large enough to make characterization of the detected pulses intractable , and so these pulses were excluded .",
    "nevertheless it is believed that it is the low flux density of pulses relative to the system sensitivity , as opposed to the disposal of pulses distorted by baseline variations , that is primarily responsible for the relatively low rate of detections in the 28  mhz and 44  mhz passbands .",
    "below 84  mhz , the duration of crab gps is broadened by at least three orders of magnitude by scattering within the host nebula and along the line - of - sight through the ism .",
    "thus it is an excellent approximation to assume that the shape of the received pulse is simply a scaled replica of the scattering impulse response @xmath26 .",
    "appropriate pulse shapes are given by @xcite as follows : @xmath27 corresponding to scattering by a thin slab of material of infinite extent , and @xmath28 corresponding to scattering by material which is uniformly - distributed along the line of sight . in both forms",
    "@xmath29 is the unit step function ( @xmath30 for @xmath31 , @xmath32 for @xmath33 ; @xmath34 taken to be the pulse start time ) and @xmath35 is referred to as the _ characteristic broadening time_. the dependence of @xmath35 on frequency in the first form is determined by the spatial distribution of electron density . when this distribution follows the kolomogorov spectrum , @xmath36 , and early measurements seemed to indicate that this was the case @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations indicate a considerably more shallow dependence , with exponents in the range @xmath37 to @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that pulses observed in the 116174  mhz band are not well described by equation  [ eg1 ] , but obtain good fits to the modified form @xmath39 which includes a rounded leading edge with rise time determined by the parameter @xmath40 .",
    "we also find in the present work that the above form provides the best overall fit to the observed pulses , whereas the other forms generally do not ; thus we have adopted this model . as in @xcite , we constrain @xmath40 to be in the range 01 and find that this range seems to accommodate all pulses encountered .",
    "thus , each pulse in the present work is characterized by @xmath35 , @xmath40 , and amplitude .",
    "these are determined as follows : first , we fit a second - order polynomial to the time preceding the start of the pulse ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) in the dedispersed time series .",
    "the baseline variation is removed , and then an automated brute - force fit in three dimensions ( @xmath35 , @xmath40 , and amplitude ) is performed to find the least - squares fit to the data .",
    "figure  [ fpulsefit ] shows examples .    for verification ,",
    "the model pulse is then subtracted from the data to confirm that the resulting time series is flat and free from artifacts .",
    "this turns out to be particularly important in our frequency range , since detectable pulses sometimes overlap each other and thus bias the estimation of parameters . in the present work ,",
    "two otherwise - qualified pulses were excluded from consideration ( and thus do not appear in table  [ tobs ] ) for this reason .",
    "the amplitude of the pulse is characterized in two ways .",
    "first , the pulse peak s / n is calculated as the ratio of the peak value of the model pulse to the pre - pulse noise power @xmath41 .",
    "this is the value used in the @xmath42 detection criterion , described above . because the integration time @xmath43 ( 2550  ms ) is at least an order of magnitude less than the apparent width of the pulse , the _ effective _",
    "s / n is much greater , and is given by @xmath44 \\sqrt{\\delta t/\\ w_{int } } \\label{esni}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the pulse energy , @xmath46 is the `` effective width '' of the pulse , and @xmath47 is the intrinsic pulse width , assumed to be @xmath48 @xcite . the effective width @xmath46 is the width of a rectangular pulse having the same peak amplitude and energy as the model pulse . for the form given in equation  [ emp ] , @xmath49 .",
    "note that the effective s / n can only be realized _ for detection _ by either optimal pulse - matched filtering or by deconvolution of @xmath26 from the intrinsic pulse shape @xcite .",
    "thus the estimated value obtained using the above procedure is used only for flux density calibration ( and not detection ) , as described in the next section .",
    "flux density calibration is challenging for array radio telescopes operating at low frequencies .",
    "the primary difficulty is that beam characteristics vary as a function of frequency and pointing relative to zenith , pointing relative to the celestial sphere ( because the system temperature may be dominated by sky noise ) , and source magnitudes can be modulated by as much as 10% due ionospheric scintillation .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of these factors as they apply to lwa1 .    for the present work we used the transit drift scan sefd measurement procedure described in appendix  b of @xcite . in this procedure , the data are collected in exactly the same manner described in section  [ sdc ] with the exception that the beams are fixed , pointing at the point of upper culmination of the pulsar , and the total duration of the observation is 2  hours .",
    "the data are reduced to full - bandwidth total power ( single channel ) time series .",
    "the transit of tau  a ( the unresolved radio source which includes the crab pulsar and the surrounding nebula ) is clearly visible as a broad peak in the time series as the source moves through the main lobe .",
    "when the source is outside the main lobe , the time series is thus a representation of the system temperature of the instrument in the vicinity of , but excluding tau  a. the peak of the time series can thus be interpreted as the sum of the sefd and the flux density of tau  a. assuming the flux density of tau  a is known , the sefd can in principle be calculated from the ratio of the peak of the time series to the level of the flat , off - peak portion of the time series . in practice , we estimate and subtract a model of the beamshape , and use the level of the resulting noise baseline at the time of transit as the `` source turned off '' value ; this reduces the error associated with the gradual change in sefd over time .    in the present work we ignore the variation in beam characteristics with source position ( in particular , source elevation ) . since each observation is limited to 1  hour around upper culmination , this is variation is believed to be negligible .",
    "for example : assuming a @xmath50 dependence of beam directivity with zenith angle @xmath51 , the associated change of directivity over a 1  hour observation is less than 2% .",
    "the flux calibration procedure requires an accurate value for the flux density of tau  a over the range of frequencies considered . our model for the flux density of tau  a is @xmath52",
    "the spectral index in this model is the one derived in @xcite .",
    "the reference flux density of 1944  jy at 76  mhz is the average of values extrapolated from measurements at 22.25  mhz and 81.5  mhz by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , using this spectral index .",
    "this model gives values which fall within the error bars of the 22.25  mhz and 81.5  mhz measurements ( @xmath53% and @xmath54% , respectively ) and turns out to be essentially the same as model used in recent work on crab gps at low frequencies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , attributed to @xcite , which uses the same spectral index but gives a 76  mhz flux density of 1915  jy .",
    "uncertainty in the reference flux density ( @xmath55% ) and the spectral index ( @xmath56 ) , together result in an uncertainty of about @xmath57% at 20  mhz relative to the 84  mhz value . in practice the model",
    "may also be biased at the lowest frequencies by factors not taken into account ; e.g. , turnover in the spectrum of the nebula .    using the above approach",
    "we obtain sefd of 13.7  kjy , 10.6  kjy , 10.3  kjy , and 11.5  kjy for the 76 , 60 , 44 , and 28  mhz passbands , respectively .",
    "the 76  mhz value is approximately twice the 74  mhz value reported in @xcite , which was obtained using essentially the same technique .",
    "the difference is due to a recalibration of the array beamforming delays which occurred before the observations reported here were started , and appears to have degraded the beamforming performance .",
    "no earlier measurements of the same pointing are available for the other passbands ; however the values reported above fall within the range 617  kjy that we normally expect for high - elevation sources",
    ". the clear presence of a peak at the expected time in the flux density calibration drift scans confirms pointing was working properly for all passbands during the observations .    from the above sefd",
    "estimates we find the @xmath42 sensitivities ( in terms of the effective s / n as described in the previous section , and not in terms of the peak waveform s / n ) are 656 , 515 , 444 , and 493  jy for the 76 , 60 , 44 , and 28  mhz passbands , respectively .",
    "these figures take into account frequency - domain blanking for rfi purposes , resulting in bandwidths of 14.07 , 13.64 , 17.44 , and 17.64  mhz for the 76 , 60 , 44 , and 28  mhz passbands , respectively .",
    "the observing sessions and the resulting detections are summarized in table  [ tobs ] .",
    "a total of 33 crab gps were identified in 10 hours of observation , distributed over 72 days during fall 2012 .",
    "one pulse was detected simultaneously in all 4 passbands , 21 pulses were detected simultaneously in 3 passbands , and an additional 11 pulses were detected simultaneously in 2 passbands .",
    "all but a handful of pulses detected passed the @xmath42 peak s / n criterion .",
    "traditionally , statistical distributions of pulse amplitudes are expressed as power law fits to the tail distributions of the corresponding probability distribution functions ( pdfs , or `` histograms '' ) ; see for example @xcite ; @xcite ; and + @xcite .",
    "this form of analysis is not meaningful for the present work due to the relatively small number of pulses detected .",
    "instead , figure  [ fcdfs ] summarizes detections as amplitude cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) ; i.e. , expected rates of detections for pulses @xmath58 a specified flux density . the cdf is the integral of the pdf ; however the tail distributions of the two functions are not related in a straightforward way .",
    "nevertheless for the purposes of pulse rate prediction in this and future work , a power law fit to cdfs shown in figure  [ fcdfs ] was done , with the following results : @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of pulses expected with flux density @xmath63 at @xmath64  mhz .",
    "( no such characterization is possible for the 28  mhz passband , since one pulse was detected . )",
    "note that the distributions exhibit very similar dependence on frequency , and may be steepening with increasing frequency .",
    "although these values can not be directly compared to analogous characterizations of the pdfs , we note that the same trend is seen in past work using the pdfs .",
    "figure  [ ffluxfreq ] shows the brightest pulses detected in each passband , the system sensitivity to crab gps ( worked out at the end of section  [ sfc ] ) , and predicted flux densities for detection rates of 1  pulse / hour using equations  [ en76][en44 ] .",
    "because the brightest pulses represent a undersampled tail distribution , it is not reasonable to infer a spectral index from our data alone .",
    "@xcite suggest a power law of @xmath65 for flux density from a two - point fit using the 23 and 200  mhz data .",
    "although the 174  mhz value from @xcite is for only 1  h , a model for the tail distribution of the pdf is also available ; this model predicts that the brightest pulse in 10  h ( for comparison with the present work ) is 10.5 kjy .",
    "this extrapolation combined with our data suggest that the dependence of flux density on frequency may be significantly less than @xmath66 .",
    "table  [ ttaud ] shows statistics of @xmath35 and the pulse rise time parameter @xmath40 for all pulses considered in the study .",
    "figure  [ ftd ] shows the statistics of @xmath35 in context with the analogous values for previous studies at other frequencies , which are also listed in table  [ ttaud ] . as explained in section  [ spc ] ,",
    "the exponent @xmath67 of the power law dependence of @xmath35 with frequency is of particular interest as it is related to the distribution of the scattering material .",
    "table  [ ttaudpl ] shows @xmath67 calculated using various combinations of the data represented in figure  [ ftd ] and table  [ ttaud ] .",
    "data from our study seem to indicate that ( 1 ) @xmath35 is significantly higher than might be expected by extrapolation from other studies , and ( 2 ) the dependence on frequency is significantly weaker than might be expected by extrapolation from other studies .    with respect to the first finding",
    ", we have ruled out errors in assumed dm and residual dispersion ( due to the use of incoherent dedispersion ) ; we find that no combination of these mechanisms can account for a bias greater than about 35  ms in @xmath35 , which is less than 8% of the observed mean value for the highest - frequency passband .",
    "the largest contribution to this bias is 28  ms due to error in the assumed dm .",
    "this error is quantified as follows : the jodrell bank crab pulsar ephemerispulsar / crab.html ] @xcite indicates that the actual dm for the months of october 2012 through january 2013 was consistently higher than the assumed dm , with the worst case error being @xmath68  pc  @xmath21 larger than the assumed dm .",
    "this corresponds to an error in dispersive delay of about 636  ms over the entire frequency range 20 - 82 mhz .",
    "however we process this frequency span in separate 16 mhz passbands , and the worst case delay error across a passband is only about 109 ms ( in the 44  mhz passband ; it is worse in the 28  mhz passband but no pulse width measurements were obtained in that passband ) .",
    "the bias subsequently induced in the estimate of @xmath35 is only about one - fourth of 109  ms ( i.e. , 28  ms ) , which was determined as follows : we performed a simulation in which a pulse following the model of equation  [ emp ] with @xmath69 and @xmath35=978  ms ( mean values for pulses detected in the 44  mhz passband ) was `` smeared '' by an error of 109 ms in dispersive delay , and then we used our model - fitting algorithm to determine the apparent values of @xmath40 and @xmath35 .",
    "we find that the apparent value of @xmath40 ( as well as pulse amplitude ) is not significantly affected and that the apparent value of @xmath35 is high by about 28  ms .",
    "the excess delay and resulting bias in all passbands is shown in table  [ tfft ] .",
    "it is more likely that our data reflect actual changes in the distribution of ionized material within the nebula : the crab pulsar is known to exhibit increases in @xmath35 by factors of 210 for intervals on the order of days to months , attributable to ionized clouds or filaments within the nebula crossing the line of sight @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the relatively high dm ( noted above ) in effect over the period of the observations .",
    "power laws in the form @xmath70 implied by our data are included in table  [ ttaudpl ] .",
    "recent studies ( summarized in this table and in table  [ ttaud ] ) have suggested that @xmath67 lies in the range @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "this is not necessarily inconsistent with our data if we consider only the 76 and 60  mhz data .",
    "however our 44  mhz data imply a flattening in the dependence with decreasing frequency which does not appear to be consistent with @xmath71 .",
    "the weak dependence on @xmath35 on frequency implied by our data , like the large values of @xmath35 implied by our data , might be interpreted as a perturbation due to inhomogeneity in the distribution of ionized material within the nebula . @xcite",
    "have shown that inhomogeneities in the form of disks and filaments may lead to large variations in the dependence of @xmath35 on frequency , and that these effects may be particularly strong at low radio frequencies .",
    "given that the studies identified in table  [ ttaud ] and figure  [ ftd ] represent widely - separated epochs of scattering behavior within the nebula , it may be too much to expect a simple dependence of @xmath35 on frequency to emerge from these data .",
    "thus a broader interpretation of our findings may be simply that the frequency dependence is complex : neither static nor well - described by a single power law extending to low radio frequencies . in any event , our results , like those of other recent studies , strongly suggest that the electron density distribution is not in the form of a kolomogorov spectrum ( @xmath72 ) , and in fact @xmath67 ( to the extent that it is reasonable to characterize the frequency dependence of pulse broadening in this manner ) is probably always significantly greater than @xmath73 .",
    "we have demonstrated the ability of lwa1 to observe single crab gps over a frequency range of @xmath744:1 at a rate of @xmath75  h@xmath76 , yielding information about pulse amplitude and pulse broadening that may be useful in gaining insight into the nature of the crab gp emission mechanism as well as providing additional information about the electron density distribution within the nebula and along the line of sight .",
    "the key to continued progress is observing a far greater number of pulses distributed over a timeframe significantly greater than the weeks - to - months - long scattering epochs . to this end",
    ", we are continuing our program of crab gp observations with the goal of increasing the number of detections by an order of magnitude and then repeating the analysis presented above .",
    "also , we are preparing for simultaneous multiband observations of crab gps using lwa1 with instruments operating at higher frequencies , which may provide additional information on crab gp behavior by allowing us to simultaneously observe emission on both sides of the turnover in the gp spectrum .",
