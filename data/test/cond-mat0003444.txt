    "the theoretical description of slow dynamics is a crucial point to elucidate the nature of the glass transition in structural glass - forming liquids .",
    "one of the commonly used approaches , mode - coupling theory ( mct ) , was from the very beginning designed for the supercooled simple liquids @xcite , i.e. for the non - disordered models ( as opposed to the models which contain quenched disorder naturally ) .",
    "later it has been proven that mc - equations become exact for a number of spin - glass models @xcite as well as for the polymeric manifold in a random media @xcite ( i.e. for the models with quenched disorder ) provided that the number of variables components goes to the infinite .",
    "actually applicability of the mc - equations has been substantially extended to the case when the time translation invariance and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem do not hold any more @xcite .",
    "this striking similarity between the models with and without quenched disorder suggests that the effective disordered potential ( e.g. , in a supercooled liquid ) is in a sense `` self - induced '' and the difference between such a `` self - induced disorder '' and the quenched disorder might not be crucial @xcite .    in order to provide some insight into self - induced disorder we employed in ref.@xcite a feynman variational principle ( vp ) for a set of interacting particles .",
    "indeed it was shown that the vp is capable to treat metastable states of the glass - forming system . the main point in ref .",
    "@xcite was that the partition function representation in terms of functional integrals is twofold : ( a ) either as an integral over the local density , @xmath3 , or ( b ) over the conjugated to @xmath4 field @xmath5 .",
    "it has been _ assumed _ that the _ component average _ free energy , @xmath6 , ( which is only meaningful in the supercooled regime ) is equal to the variational free energy @xmath7 .",
    "there are at least four strong reasons in favor of this ( at first sight not obvious ) assumption .",
    "* the variational free energy @xmath8 is a upper bound for the _ canonical _ free energy , i.e. , @xmath9 , as it should be since @xmath10 , where the complexity @xmath11 @xcite . * after implementation of vp the initial problem is reduced to a self - consistent random field ginzburg - landau model ( rfglm ) .",
    "then , as was shown previously , the corresponding field @xmath12 must be upgraded to a _ replicated _ field @xmath13 , where @xmath14 ( with the final limit @xmath15 ) and the density field @xmath4 plays the role of an `` external '' field .",
    "note that here the density @xmath16 is gaussian due to the use of the vp .",
    "eventually the correlators of @xmath17 and @xmath18 - fields can be determined self - consistently . *",
    "the resulting replicated partition function for rfglm has a typical form which may eventually lead to the replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) , structural glass transition and the  self - induced  disorder . *",
    "finally , in the case of the long - range interaction the partition function allows the expansion around the saddle point , or mean - field ( mf ) , solution .",
    "it is possible to show then that the _ next to the mean - field approximation _ and vp merge and both become exact , i. e. @xmath19 and the glassy phase does not appear .",
    "some evidence for this behavior was deduced from the results for the particles on a @xmath20- dimensional hypersphere @xcite at large dimensions , @xmath21 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to face the full dynamical problem for a non - disorded model with a long range interaction . using the expansion around the saddle point solution we derive the full equation of motion for",
    "the time dependent density - density correlator and show that a `` glassy '' solution does not exist .",
    "conversly , if we add a term describing quenched disorder , by random distribution of the strength of the interaction potential , then the resulting equations of motion for two time density correlation and response functions fall in the same class as mc - equations which have been widely discussed @xcite .",
    "this means that the `` self - induced '' disorder is not generic for the pure model with the long - range interaction and vice versa on addition of a quenched disorder the phase space becomes very rugged resulting in slow dynamical processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section [ ii ]",
    "we first introduce the theorotical model without quenched disorder .",
    "its dynamics is discussed by using the functional integral technique .",
    "the saddle point solution yields the mean field dynamcis .",
    "expansions around the saddle point yield one loop corrections .",
    "the legendre transformation provides the possibilty of the analysis of the full dynamic correlation matrix . in the section [ iii ]",
    "quenched disorder is introduced by a `` random bond model '' and a gaussian disorder .",
    "the corresponding generating functional ( gf ) is computed by the self - consistent hartree approximation , which results in a set of coupled langevin equations , that are solved in their asymptotic regimes .",
    "more details on the calculations are laid out in the corresponding appendices .",
    "we start from a simple model system which consists of interacting particles . to do so , let us consider a set of @xmath22 particles in @xmath23 - dimensional space interacting by a pair potential of the form @xmath24 this is a typical example of a long - range potential with a characteristic length @xmath25 and a coupling constant @xmath26 .",
    "the choice of this potential is twofold .",
    "it contains a cut off at a @xmath27 and allows thus to control the range of the interaction .",
    "moreover at small scales @xmath28 it consists of a typical power law decay with long range character , if @xmath29 .",
    "therefore the so chosen potential allows to keep control on range and nature of the interaction , which will become essential below . to ensure extensivity of the total interaction energy we require that the integral @xmath30 , i.e. it does not depend on the number of particles @xmath0 . as a result",
    "we have @xmath31 .",
    "the intermolecular potential ( [ 1 ] ) has the form of the generalized kac potential @xmath32 which has been used for the rigorous treatment of the van - der - waals theory @xcite . in order to provide conditions for the expansion around a saddle point , carried out later on ( see below )",
    ", we should require that the length @xmath27 must be larger compared to the characteristic size of the system , which scales naturally as @xmath33 ) at @xmath34 . as a consequence we find the limits for the range parameter @xmath35 @xmath36 below we shall restrict our considerations to the case : @xmath37 , and the strength of the interaction @xmath38 ( pure repulsion ) without loss of generalization in the main statements we are going to predict .",
    "then the fourier transformation of the potential ( [ 1 ] ) takes especially simple form @xmath39 which allows accurate analytic calculations . in the limit @xmath34",
    "we have thus @xmath40 , but the relevant minimum wave vector is @xmath41 and thus @xmath42 can be actually neglected under the integration over the whole @xmath43 - space . as a result",
    "we arrive formally at a _",
    "one - component plasma model _ ( ocp )",
    "@xcite where the electroneutrality is implicitly provided by a neutralizing background .      in the following we set up the relevant equations of motion for the model system . we restrict ourselves to the langevin dynamics , which can be comfortably formulated in terms of dynamic functionals which allows the systematic @xmath1 - expansion treatment .",
    "the langevin dynamics of @xmath0 particles interacting via the potential ( [ 1 ] ) ( at @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) is described by the equation of motion @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the mass and the friction coefficient respectively , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the random force in eq.([4 ] ) is gaussian with @xmath49 and the correlator @xmath50 where from now on we work in units where the boltzmann constant @xmath51 .",
    "as was mentioned , it is more convenient to reformulate the langevin problem ( [ 4])-([5 ] ) by using the celebrated martin - siggia - rose generating functional ( gf ) method @xcite .",
    "the method was first applied for the @xmath52 - model with the long - range interaction in @xcite and for the polymer melt dynamics in @xcite . despite the fact that the langevin equation ( [ 4 ] ) is of the second order it is possible to show that the jacobian which appear under transformation to the functional variables , still equal to one ( see appendix in @xcite ) . after using this technique for the problem ( [ 4 ] ) - ( [ 5 ] )",
