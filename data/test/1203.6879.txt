    "this work is concerned with catalytic branching processes that model the dynamics of catalyst - reactant populations in which the activity level of the reactant depends on the amount of catalyst present . branching processes in catalytic environments",
    "have been studied extensively and are motivated , for instance , by biochemical reaction networks ; see @xcite and references therein . a typical setting",
    "consists of populations of multiple types such that the rate of growth ( depletion ) of one population type is directly affected by population sizes of other types .",
    "the simplest such model consists of a continuous time countable state branching process describing the evolution of the catalyst population and a second branching process for which the branching rate is proportional to the total mass of the catalyst population , modeling the evolution of reactant particles .",
    "such processes were introduced in  @xcite in the setting of super - brownian motions ; see  @xcite . for classical catalyst - reactant",
    "branching processes , the catalyst population dies out with positive probability and subsequent to the catalyst extinction , the reactant population stays unchanged , and therefore the population dynamics are modeled until the time the catalyst becomes extinct . in this work ,",
    "we consider a setting where the catalyst population is maintained above a positive threshold through a specific form of controlled immigration . branching process models with immigration",
    "have also been well studied in literature ; see @xcite and references therein . however ,",
    "typical mechanisms that have been considered correspond to adding an independent poisson component ; see , for example ,  @xcite . here ,",
    "instead , we consider a model where immigration takes place only when the population drops below a certain threshold . roughly speaking",
    ", we consider a sequence @xmath0 of continuous time branching processes , where @xmath1 starts with @xmath2 particles .",
    "when the population drops below @xmath2 , it is instantaneously restored to the level  @xmath2 .",
    "there are many settings where controlled immigration models of the above form arise naturally .",
    "one class of examples arises from predator - prey models in ecology , where one may be concerned with the restoration of populations that are close to extinction by reintroducing species when they fall below a certain threshold . in our work , the motivation for the study of such controlled immigration models comes from problems in chemical reaction networks where one wants to keep the levels of certain types of molecules above a threshold in order to maintain a desired level of production ( or inhibition ) of other chemical species in the network .",
    "such questions are of interest in the study of control and regulation of chemical reaction networks . a control action where one minimally adjusts the levels of one chemical type to keep it above a fixed threshold is one of the simplest regulatory mechanisms , and  the goal of this research is to study system behavior under such mechanisms with the long - term objective of designing optimal control policies .",
    "the specific goal of the current work is to derive simpler approximate and reduced models , through the theory of diffusion approximations and stochastic averaging techniques , that are more tractable for simulation and mathematical treatment than the original branching process models . in order to keep the presentation simple ,",
    "we consider the setting of one catalyst and one reactant .",
    "however , similar limit theorems can be obtained for a more general chemical reaction network in which the levels of some of the chemical species are regulated in a suitable manner .",
    "settings where some of the chemical species act as inhibitors rather than catalysts are also of interest and can be studied using similar techniques .",
    "these extensions will be pursued elsewhere .",
    "our main goal is to establishes diffusion approximations for such regulated catalyst - reactant systems under suitable scalings .",
    "we consider two different scaling regimes ; in the first setting the catalyst and reactant evolve on `` comparable timescales , '' while in the second setting the catalyst evolves `` much faster '' than the reactant . in the former",
    "setting , the limit model is described through a coupled system of reflected stochastic differential equations with reflection in the space @xmath3 .",
    "the precise result ( theorem  [ thmcrdiffusion ] ) is stated in section [ secdiffusionlimit ] .",
    "such limit theorems are of interest for various analytic and computational reasons .",
    "it is simpler to simulate ( reflected ) diffusions than branching processes , particularly for large network settings .",
    "analytic properties such as hitting time probabilities and steady state behavior are more easily analyzed for the diffusion models than for their branching process counterparts . in general ,",
    "such diffusion limits give parsimonious model representations and provide useful qualitative insight to the underlying stochastic phenomena .",
    "for the second scaling regime , where the catalyst evolution is much faster , we establish a stochastic averaging limit theorem .",
    "a key ingredient here is an ergodicity result , which says that under a suitable `` criticality from below '' assumption on the catalyst dynamics , the limiting catalyst reflected diffusion admits a unique stationary distribution , which takes an explicit form ( proposition  [ propstationarydistrofx ] ) .",
    "characterization of the invariant distribution is based on a variant of echeverria s criterion for constrained markov processes  @xcite .",
    "next , by constructing suitable _ uniform _ lyapunov functions , we show that the stationary distribution of the scaled catalyst branching process converges to that of the catalyst diffusion ( theorem [ thmtightnessandconvergenceofnu^n1 ] ) .",
    "these results are then used to establish a stochastic averaging principle that governs the dynamics of the reactant population in the fast catalyst limit .",
    "proofs proceed by developing suitable moment estimates that are uniform in time and the scaling parameter and by using characterization results for probability laws of reflected diffusions through certain constrained martingale problems  @xcite .",
    "the limit evolution of the reactant population is given through an autonomous one - dimensional sde with coefficients that depend on the stationary distribution of a reflected diffusion in @xmath4 .",
    "such model reductions are important in that they not only help in better understanding the dynamics of the system but also help in reducing computational costs in simulations . indeed , since in the model considered here the invariant distribution is explicit , the coefficients in the one - dimensional averaged diffusion model are easily computed , and consequently this model is significantly easier to analyze and simulate than the original two - dimensional model .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite and references therein for similar results in the setting of ( nonregulated ) chemical reaction networks .",
    "it will be of interest to see if similar model reductions can be obtained for general multi - dimensional regulated chemical - reaction networks .",
    "key mathematical challenges will be to identify suitable conditions for ergodicity of multi - dimensional reflected diffusions in polyhedral domains that arise from the regulated part of the network , and to develop uniform ( in time and the scaling parameter ) moment estimates for such multi - dimensional constrained diffusions .",
    "we consider two different formulations of models with multiple time scales . in theorem",
    "[ thmfastcatalystweaklimit ] we consider the setting where both catalyst and reactant processes are described through ( reflected ) diffusions and the time scale parameter appears in the coefficients of the catalyst evolution equation .",
    "an important step here is to argue that the generator of the two - dimensional catalyst - reactant reflected diffusion is suitably close to the generator of the one - dimensional averaged diffusion , for large values of the scaling parameter .",
    "bounds on the exponential moments of the catalyst process , obtained in lemma  [ lemunifmombdx ] , play a key role in this argument .",
    "the second formulation is considered in theorem [ fastcatalystbpaveraging ] . here",
    ", both catalyst and reactant populations evolve according to near critical countable state branching processes , and the branching rate in the catalyst dynamics is of higher order than that for the reactant process . in this setting one encounters the additional difficulty of showing that the steady state distributions of the scaled catalyst branching process , for large values of the scaling parameter , are suitably close to the stationary distribution of the limiting catalyst reflected diffusion .",
    "the approach taken here is based on characterizing the limit points of a certain sequence of random measures on the path space of the catalyst process and the associated reflection process , as time and the scaling parameter together approach infinity .",
    "the model considered in this work does not incorporate any spatial dynamics of the two chemical species . as noted earlier in the , in the unregulated setting , dawson and fleischmann @xcite considered catalyst - reactant systems , with chemical species moving continuously in a spatial domain , given in terms of super - brownian motions .",
    "it will be of interest to develop analogous continuous spatial models for the regulated catalyst - reactant systems of the form considered in the current work .",
    "this question will be explored in a future work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section [ secdiffusionlimit ] by presenting the basic limit theorem in the setting of `` comparable time scales . ''",
