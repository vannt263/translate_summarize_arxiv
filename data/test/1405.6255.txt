    "quantum entanglement , an interesting and attractive phenomenon in quantum mechanics , plays a significant role not only in testing quantum nonlocality , but also in processing a variety of quantum information tasks @xcite .",
    "multi - particle entangled states , such as ghz states , w states , cluster states , noon states , etc , are the fundamental resource of quantum information processing ( qip ) .",
    "the noon states , as an intereting multi - particle entangled states , have the form as latexmath:[\\[\\label{01 }    which contain @xmath1 indistinguishable particles in an equal superposition of all being in one of the two possible modes .",
    "it s well established that the noon states have significant applications either in lithography @xcite or in quantum metrology @xcite . especially , it can be used to obviously improve the phase sensitivity in quantum interferometry and beat the classical diffraction limit in quantum lithography @xcite . recently",
    ", much attention has been paid to prepare the noon states .",
    "many theoretical and experimental schemes have been proposed for generating the noon states via optical components @xcite , cold atomic ensemble @xcite , superconducting circuits @xcite and cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite . however , the success probabilities of the proposals based on the linear optical components , are very low as the number of particles increasing @xcite .",
    "some people suggested using the optical nonlinear process for the generation of noon states .",
    "yet , it is difficult to carry out experimentally so far @xcite . the qed system , as a suitable candidate for demonstrating qip and quantum state engineering @xcite , has been studied extensively .",
    "many proposals for preparing noon states based on qed have been put forward , as previously mentioned . however , all of these systems are always affected by the various of external factors which will induce the decoherence and affect the probability of success , even destroy the entanglement .",
    "although many kinds of physical systems are used to avoid or reduce the decoherence , it is always imperfect yet .",
    "so the preparation of the entangled multi - particle noon states is still a severe challenge in the state of the art , though great progress has been made in recent decades . on the other hand , the adiabatic passage @xcite , as an useful tool for realizing qip , is becoming more and more powerful and charming owing to its robust against the spontaneous emission of the excited states , cavity photon leakage and some experimental parameter errors . as a result",
    ", the technique of adiabatic passage has been extensively studied for the entanglement generation @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme for generating the noon states of two sets of the atoms via adiabatic passage . in the scheme ,",
    "a double @xmath0-type three - level atom is trapped in a bimodal cavity and two sets of @xmath0-type three - level atoms are translated into and outside of two single mode cavities respectively . after a series of operations and suitable interaction time ,",
    "the arbitrary large-@xmath1 entangled noon states of two sets of @xmath0-type three - level atoms in distant cavities can be obtained by performing a single projective measurement on the double @xmath0-type three - level atom .",
    "our scheme has the following characteristics : ( 1 ) due to along the dark state , the cavity modes are unpopulated during the whole interaction process , hence the scheme is robust against the decays of the cavities .",
    "( 2 ) owing to adiabatical eliminations of atomic excited states , the spontaneous emission rate can be regarded as zero . ( 3 ) under certain conditions , the probabilities of fibre modes populated can be negligible safely , thus the decays of fibres are effectively suppressed .",
    "( 4 ) taking advantages of adiabatic passage , the scheme is insensitive to small fluctuation of experimental parameters .",
    "( 5 ) the scheme can be used to generate arbitrary large-@xmath1 noon states in theory .",

    "[ fig04](b ) that when @xmath104 , the population of @xmath97 is 1 , which means the noon states can be deterministically achieved via adiabatic evolution .",
    "certainly , all the above results are based on the ideal case because the influences of atomic spontaneous emission , photon leakage out of the cavities and fibres are not taken into account .",
    "in fact , the effects of these factors are inevitable , so we will study the effects of these factors on the fidelity below .    for purpose of generating atomic noon states , we have used the large detuning condition and adiabatically eliminated the excited states of the atoms , as a result , setting the spontaneous emission rate to be zero is acceptable . while , the effect of photon loss out of the cavity can also be ignored safely in our scheme because the cavity modes are never populated in the whole process due to the adiabatic passage along dark state .",
    "the terms related to @xmath105 and @xmath106 , however , have been discarded for above calculations since we have assumed that @xmath107 are populated , and then they may evolve into @xmath108 due to the fibre decays , which will cause error for generating the noon states . considering the effect of photon leakage out of the fibres , the fidelity can be written as @xmath109 where @xmath110 are given in eq .",

    "however , even if there exists a relatively large fibre decay rate @xmath116 when @xmath117 , we can still obtain noon states with a high fidelity . besides , we plot the fidelity as a function of @xmath118 for different @xmath119 in fig .",
    "[ fig05](b ) with @xmath100 .",
    "we can see that the fidelities increase gradually with the increase of @xmath118 , while , with the increase of decay rate @xmath111 , the fidelity approaches 1 more slowly .",
    "but , when @xmath120 the fidelity is higher than 0.99 even with @xmath121 .",

    "the other parameters are the same as those in fig .",
    "obviously , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] that the fidelity decreases with the increase of the particle number @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , the fidelity can still reach 0.934 even if the particle number @xmath1 is up to 10 when @xmath121 and up to 20 when @xmath123 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have proposed a scheme for generating arbitrary large-@xmath1 noon states via adiabatic passage . by using a sequence of pulse laser fields ,",
    "our atom - cavity - fibre system is always in the dark states . in the whole process",
    ", the influence of atomic spontaneous emissions , photon leakage out of fibres and cavities are effectively compressed via adiabatic elimination of excited states and adiabatic passage .",
    "furthermore , we make an estimation on the fidelities of the noon states by considering different parameters and show that our scheme is insensitive to small fluctuations of experimental parameters .",

    "<S> the three cavities connected by optical fibres are always in vacuum states . after a series of operations and suitable interaction time </S>",
    "<S> , we can obtain arbitrary large-@xmath1 noon states of two sets of @xmath0-type three - level atoms in distant cavities by performing a single projective measurement on the double @xmath0-type three - level atom . </S>",
    "<S> due to adiabatic elimination of atomic excited states and the application of adiabatic passage , our scheme is robust against the spontaneous emissions of atoms , the decays of fibres and cavities photon leakage . </S>",
    "<S> so the scheme has a high fidelity and feasibility under the current available techniques . </S>",
