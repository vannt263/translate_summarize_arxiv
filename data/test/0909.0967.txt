    "this dip in the light curve is attributed to adiabatic cooling after the initial shock breakout ( s02 ) , and reinforces the idea that the progenitor is the result of a core - collapse of a massive star ( s02 ) .",
    "using hst data , @xcite further constrained that the sn  2008ax progenitor was either a single massive star that lost most of its h - envelope prior to exploding or an interacting binary in a low - mass cluster .    using the method described by @xcite",
    ", we performed a monte carlo simulation with @xmath184 realizations of the sn  2008ax @xmath22-band light curve by varying three model parameters : kinetic energy ( @xmath7 ) , ejected mass ( @xmath9 ) , and ejected nickel mass ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the best @xmath185 fit resulted in @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 .",
    "the resultant parameters are consistent with values calculated by @xcite for other type iib sne , except that the sn  2008ax value for @xmath9 is @xmath189 higher .    a ( @xmath190 ) and ( @xmath191 ) color plot ( figure  [ fig - lc]-_lower - left _ ) tracks temperature variations in the photosphere ( stritzinger et  al . 2009 ; hereafter s09 ) .",
    "initially , the blue to red jump ( @xmath192 ) is due to the adiabatic cooling discussed previously .",
    "this is followed by a transition back to the blue as the photospheric temperature increases and the light curves reach maximum .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the color curves transition back to the red and begin to level off . of note",
    "is that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves stop declining in brightness at @xmath193 after maximum .",
    "this corresponds with the color evolution to the blue in the @xmath194 at the same time .",
    "this blue excess was also seen in sne 2007y and 2008aq , and was attributed to a change in the opacity of the ejecta , or shock heating produced by interaction of high - velocity sn ejecta with circumstellar material ( csm ; s09 ) .",
    "the lack of an x - ray source in pre - sn _ chandra _ images and the detection of a fading x - ray source in _ swift _ xrt data confirms that x - ray emission is detected from sn  2008ax .",
    "these x - rays likely arise from interaction of the outgoing sn shock with substantial amounts of csm .",
    "if the csm was deposited by a strong stellar wind prior to outburst , as expected for the massive progenitor of a sn iib , the x - ray luminosity can be used to estimate the mass - loss rate . following the discussion in @xcite",
    ", we infer a mass - loss rate of the progenitor of @xmath195 for an assumed speed of the outgoing shock of @xmath196 and scaled for a stellar wind speed of @xmath197 .",
    "only two other sn iib have been detected in x - rays over the past four decades : sne  1993j @xcite and 2001gd @xcite .",
    "in contrast , sn  2008ax is only a weak x - ray emitter , one and two orders of magnitude fainter than sne  2001gd and 1993j , respectively .",
    "subsequently , the inferred mass - loss rate for the progenitor of sn  2008ax is significantly below that of sn  1993j ( @xmath198 ; * ? ? ? * ) and more characteristic of sne iip ( @xmath199 ; cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this wide range of mass - loss rates for sne iib could be caused by a diversity of binary progenitor systems .",
    "the general nature of the sn  2008ax radio light curve ( figure  [ fig - lc]-_right _ ) is very typical of core - collapse sn ( ccsne ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the time evolution of the radio emission is somewhat unusual for a type iib radio sn when compared to sne  1993j , 2001gd , and 2001ig @xcite .",
    "sn  2008ax reached its 6  cm peak radio luminosity in 14  days , while sn  1993j took 133  days after explosion to achieve peak @xcite . the exact time to reach",
    "this point is uncertain for both sne  2001gd and 2001ig , but the parameterized models outlined in @xcite indicate the peak occurred at @xmath200 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the first event associated with a type ic sn and a gamma - ray burst , sn 1998bw / grb 980425 , reached its peak 6  cm radio luminosity in 10 days @xcite .    a typical radio - derived mass - loss rate for the earlier type iib sne is @xmath201 @xcite .",
    "the exact radio - derived mass - loss rate for sn  2008ax is difficult to establish as the exact nature of the sn progenitor is ambiguous @xcite . following the discussion in @xcite",
    ", we infer a range of possible mass - loss rate of the progenitor of @xmath202 for an assumed speed of the outgoing shock of @xmath196 and scaled for a stellar wind speed of @xmath197 .",
    "the ambiguity of the nature of the progenitor makes the wind speed of the progenitor - established csm very uncertain .",
    "furthermore , the radio evolution of sn  2008ax appears to show short time scale modulations of @xmath203 ( see figure  [ fig - lc]-_right _ ) .",
    "this may be similar to the evolution of sn  2001ig whose progenitor was attributed to an interacting - binary system or the evolution of sn 1998bw whose progenitor was a very massive star @xcite .",
    "a deeper analysis of the radio evolution of sn  2008ax is on - going .",
    "spectroscopic observations of sn  2008ax occurred 16 and 25 days after explosion .",
    "the het spectra ( figure  [ fig - het ] ) are very similar  with prominent @xmath204 and hei lines  to sne  1993j @xcite and 2008ax ( p08 ) spectra taken 18 and 28 days post explosion , respectively .",
    "p08 showed at 56 days that caii was also present in sn  2008ax , but presented no data redward of @xmath205 previous to this time .",
    "het spectra reveal that the caii absorption line was significant at 16 days ( @xmath206 days before @xmath21-peak ) and was a factor of @xmath206 larger nine days later .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of sne  2005bf ( ibc ; * ? ? ? * ) and 2007y ( ib ; s09 ) .",
    "both sne had very early strong caii absorption lines , followed by a decrease in strength , and then a rapid increase in strength . assuming the early time caii absoprtion in sn  2008ax was also strong and then weakened , the het spectra indicate around peak and after peak that caii is caused by a photospheric , rather than a high velocity component above the photosphere ( s09 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the behavior of the blueward components of the het spectra , particularly the strengthening of the hei lines , are consistent with the p08 results .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves of sn  2008ax show a rapid initial decline to a minimum approximately four days after shock breakout .",
    "the sn then brightens to maximum light in the @xmath0-band at @xmath207 days after shock breakout .",
    "this behaviour is seen in other ccsne and is predicted in numerical models of ccsne with stripped atmospheres @xcite .",
    "however , it is nt seen in most ccsne light curves .",
    "this may be due to the paucity of detailed early - time observations for most sne , or indicate a physical difference in the progenitors .",
    "the dip is attributed to rapid adiabatic cooling of the photosphere , which is accelerated by the shock passage .",
    "the time scale of adiabatic cooling depends on the volume of the photospheric shell , and thus the radius of the progenitor .",
    "modelling of ccsne with stripped atmospheres suggests that the adiabatic cooling acts on time scales of several days , which is in agreement with the uv minimum seen in sn  2008ax .    @xcite produced models of exploding helium stars , which are believed to produce sne iib .",
    "the model assumes the progenitor is a stripped star in a binary system . from the x - ray and radio mass - loss rates coupled with the short time evolution of the radio emission",
    ", the sn  2008ax progenitor appears to have been in an interacting binary , consistent with the work of @xcite .",
    "the observed time of maximum light and shape of the later sn  2008ax light curve are consistent with an unmixed progenitor model which produces early uv dips lasting longer than those with mixing in the progenitor .",
    "dips in mixed models tend to have minima at @xmath208 days while those in unmixed models tend to have minima at @xmath209 510 days .",
    "the time of the sn  2008ax dip is consistent with a mixed progenitor ; however , the time is uncertain due to the lack of very early time data .",
    "it s therefore possible that the true minimum occurred later than @xmath174 days , as is predicted for unmixed models .",
    "further evidence for an unmixed progenitor comes from the strength of the dip .",
    "the observed dip is @xmath174 magnitudes consistent with an unmixed model .",
    "these three lines of evidence suggest that the progenitor of sn  2008ax was either unmixed , or very lightly mixed .",
    "@xcite find that helium stars with less mixing tend to be more massive than those that undergo extensive mixing .",
    "if the progenitor of sn  2008ax is unmixed then it may be on the more massive side of the progenitor mass distribution .",
    "this supports our result that the mass - loss rate from sn  2008ax is lower than for a typical type iib sne .",
    "the onset and strength of the adiabatic cooling dip increases as the progenitor mass increases , so more massive progenitors have more prominent adiabatic cooling following the shock breakout .",
    "this suggests that the lack of an observed cooling dip for many sne iib may be due to less massive progenitors .",
    "this , combined with the paucity of high - cadence early - time observations , may explain why the cooling dip is not seen in many sne iib .",
