    "the type ia sn  1998bu was discovered on may 9.9 ut by @xcite in a spiral arm of ngc  3368 ( m96 ) , a nearby sab galaxy .",
    "it had very good photometric and spectroscopic coverage by several groups @xcite showing that the luminosity decline was slower than the average ( @xmath0 , the magnitude decline in the early 15 days after maximum , was @xmath1 mag ) .",
    "this is almost as slow as the slowest sn  ia on record , sn  1991 t , although , unlike sn  1991 t , sn  1998bu was spectroscopically normal before and around maximum .",
    "the distance to the host galaxy was measured using cepheids variables @xcite as @xmath2 . however , a calibration of the absolute luminosity of the sn depends also on the estimated reddening which in the case of sn  1998bu is significant . @xcite",
    "estimated @xmath3 based on the comparison of the spectral energy distribution of sn  1998bu with that of the template sn  ia 1981b .",
    "sn  1998bu was included in our program of monitoring of the nebular phase of sn  ia . during this monitoring",
    "we realized that sn  1998bu was not declining with the expected rate ; this , combined with the change in the spectral appearance gave the first evidence of the emergence of a light echo in sn  1998bu @xcite .",
    "these observations are presented here for the first time along with a simple modeling .",
    "when the sn  ia ejecta become optically thin , about 100 days after the explosion , the sn luminosity is determined essentially by the deposition of the kinetic energy of the positrons released by the decay of @xmath4 .",
    "there is evidence that even positron deposition may not be complete @xcite , and so at advanced phases the light curve declines either at the @xmath4 rate ( @xmath5 mag/100d ) or faster .",
    "the only previously known case of a sn  ia with a decline slower than the @xmath4 rate was sn  1991 t , whose slow late decline and peculiar spectra were interpreted as due to a light echo @xcite .    a first indication that sn  1998bu was beginning to deviate from the normal exponential decline came on december 4 1999 , roughly 500 days after maximum . at this epoch",
    "the observed magnitude ( @xmath6 ) was already 2 mag brighter than the extrapolation of the radioactive decay tail .",
    "additional photometric observations over the following few months showed that the sn luminosity remained almost constant ( the decline was only @xmath7 mag in 100 days ) . also , the color at these epochs was unusually blue ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this behavior was reminiscent of that exhibited by sn  1991 t @xcite .",

    "1 shows the absolute v light curves of sn  1998bu and sn  1991 t @xcite .",
    "both light curves have been calibrated using the cepheid - based distances @xcite and corrected for total extinction ( cf . tab .  1 ) .",
    "the striking similarity of the two light curves suggests that the same mechanism causing the flattening of the light curve of sn  1991 t was also acting in the case of sn  1998bu .    although this is not clearly visible in fig .  1 , the absolute magnitude of sn  1998bu at maximum was about 0.5 mag fainter than that of sn  1991 t . based on the @xmath0 vs @xmath16 relation @xcite",
    "the difference should be only 0.05 mag .",
    "the gap increases slightly with time , and it reaches about 0.8 - 0.9 mag one year after maximum . that sne  ia with a very similar @xmath17 actually show significant dispersion in some of their other properties is a well - known fact @xcite , and is one of the main caveats for the use of sn  ia as distance indicators .",
    "however , this is not essential for the discussion presented here .    the slow photometric evolution of sn  1998bu makes it a viable target for spectroscopy even 2 yrs after explosion .",
    "spectra of sn  1998bu where obtained using the eso  3.6 m telescope ( and efosc2 ) at la silla at two epochs , 2000 march 3 and march 30 .",
    "we used grism # 11 which , combined with the 1.2 arcsec slit , allowing one to cover the range 3300 - 7500  with a resolution of about 15 .",
    "eventually , since no spectral evolution was apparent between the two epochs , the two spectra were merged to improve the s / n .",
    "the total integration time was 9000 sec .",
    "the resulting spectrum , labeled with the average phase of 670d , is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "for comparison we also show the spectrum of sn  1991 t obtained with the same telescope at a similar phase .",
    "we also show spectra of the two sne at a much earlier epoch , when the luminosity decline was still tracking the radioactive exponential tail .",
    "the similarity of the spectral evolution of the two sne is remarkable .",
    "about 300 days after maximum the spectra are dominated by the strong emission lines of feii ] and feiii ] which are typical of sne  ia in the nebular phase .",
    "these emission lines originate in the iron nebula and are powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath18co to @xmath18fe @xcite .    in correspondence to the flattening of the light curve the spectra change completely , showing a blue continuum with superposed broad absorption and emission features .",
    "these spectra resemble the photospheric epoch spectra , but they do not match any specific early - time epoch . for sn  1991 t it",
    "was convincingly suggested @xcite that the peculiar late time light curve and spectrum can be explained assuming that the emission at these epochs is dominated by the echo from circumstellar dust of the light emitted by the sn near maximum .",
    "our observations suggest that the same mechanism is at work also in sn  1998bu .",
    "the key element for such a mechanism to work is the presence of a dust layer in the vicinity of the sn , scattering towards the observer a fraction of the light emitted by the sn . because of the different travel times the observed spectrum is a combination of the early time scattered spectra and of the direct , late - time spectrum . in principle , the details of the echo ( intensity , duration , spectrum ) depend on the spatial distribution of the dust and on the physics of the scattering process .",
    "a careful analysis and modeling of time distributed observations may allow one to derive useful constraints .",
    "such a detailed study is the subject of future work ( patat et al . in preparation ) , while here we illustrate the basic principles of the phenomenon .",
    "in general , the light curve of the echo is related to the light emitted by the sn by the following relation @xcite :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the flux of the sn at time @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the fraction of this light which is scattered towards the observer , depends on the geometry of the system and on the properties of the dust ( units of @xmath22 are s@xmath23 ; cf .",
    "equation  [ fdt ] ) . as a first approximation",
    "we can assume that the sn light curve is a short pulse with a duration @xmath24 , during which the emitted flux @xmath25 is constant",
    ". under this assumption equation [ flux ] becomes @xmath26 , where @xmath24 can be obtained by a numerical integration of the observed light curve as @xmath27 . in the case of the @xmath28 light curve of sn  1991 t @xcite",
    "this gives @xmath24=0.11 yr .",
    "as one of the possible geometries which are consistent with the observations , we consider a thin dust sheet lying in front of the sn and extended perpendicularly to the line of sight .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we make the hypothesis that the sheet thickness @xmath29 is much smaller than the distance between the sn and the dust elements and we consider only single scattering .",
    "given this idealized configuration and assuming the scattering phase function by henyey & greenstein ( 1941 ) , an analytic expression for the function @xmath22 can be derived relatively easily @xcite as :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the distance of the dust layer from the sn , @xmath32 is the optical depth of the dust layer , @xmath33 is the dust albedo , and @xmath34 is a parameter which represents the degree of forward scattering .",
    "the value of @xmath34 ranges from 0 for isotropic scattering to 1 for purely forward scattering .",
    "empirical estimates and numerical calculations @xcite give @xmath350.6 . for the dust albedo",
    "we have adopted @xmath360.6 @xcite .",
    "equation [ fdt ] shows that if the dust is too close to the object , even if it survives the exposure to the enormous radiation flux of the sn , it would not produce a constant , long duration echo .",
    "this is because of both the angular dependence of the scattering phase function and the sn radiation dilution . in the case of sn  1991 t",
    "the echo luminosity declined by a factor of 4 over @xmath37 yrs @xcite which implies @xmath38 lyr ( equation  [ fdt ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if a dust layer is to produce a significant light echo , it must be located close enough to the sn that the emission from the sn is not too diluted .",
    "in fact , other conditions being similar , for a distant cloud ( @xmath39 ) , the echo flux is @xmath40 . in particular , since we found that the cloud must be located farther than 45 lyr from the sn , we derive a lower limit for the dust optical depth of @xmath41 .",
    "since in our model the dust layer is located in front of the sn we expect that it causes some extinction on the line of sight .",
    "assuming that the column density is constant along different lines of sight and based on the relation @xmath42 @xcite we can estimate for sn  1991 t a lower limit for @xmath43 mag .",
    "actually , both sn  1991 t and sn  1998bu show evidence of significant extinction from interstellar dust associated with the host galaxy , @xmath44 for sn  1991 t and @xmath45 for sn  1998bu ( tab .  1 ) .",
    "these values were derived mainly by photometric methods based on the analysis of the light curve and the sn color , and therefore they are affected by large uncertainties . in a simplified scenario",
    ", one can assume that there is only one cloud which is causing both the observed extinction and the light echo .",
    "in this case , since we fix the column density of the cloud , we can derive the distance @xmath31 of the cloud itself from the sn through a fit to the echo luminosity .",
    "the light curve fit for sn  1991 t , shown in fig .  1 , gives @xmath46 lyr . in the case of sn",
    "1998bu the light curve is similar to that of sn  1991 t , hence @xmath47 yr , but the optical depth of the dust is about a factor 2 larger : therefore we obtain @xmath48 lyr .",
    "note that these estimates are independent of the adopted distance for the parent galaxies , because they depend only on the ratio between the luminosity of the echo and that of the sn at maximum .",
    "the distance @xmath31 is related to the linear diameter of the ring through the relation @xmath49 . in the case of sn  1991 t the echo has been resolved with a diameter of 0.@xmath504 .",
    "based on the cepheid distance to ngc  4527 , this results in a linear diameter @xmath51 lyr and hence @xmath52 lyr . given the observational uncertainties , this is in very good agreement with the estimate based on the light echo modeling . in the case of sn  1998bu , because of the much higher optical depth of the dust , we had to place the dust layer at a larger distance than for sn  1991 t . in turn , this causes the echo ring diameter at any given time to be larger .",
    "based on the geometry described earlier we obtain that at the time of writing , 2.5 yr after the explosion , the diameter of the echo should be @xmath53 arcsec .",
    "indeed , the echo of sn  1998bu has already been resolved using hst ( leibundgut p.c . ) .",
    "a consistency check of the light echo interpretation for the peculiar light curve of sn  1998bu can be obtained by comparing the observed and computed spectrum of the light echo .",
    "clearly the most important contribution to the light echo comes from the light emitted near maximum .",
    "spectra of sn  1998bu at eight different epochs from -6 to 50 days after maximum were published by @xcite .",
    "weighting the spectra according to the integrated luminosity around each observed epoch and using our assumed geometry ( cf .",
    "equation 1 ) , we computed the contribution of each early - time spectrum to the emerging echo spectrum at phase 670d .",
    "the input spectra were corrected for reddening using a standard extinction law and assuming that the scattering function as a similar @xmath54 dependence .",
    "these corrected spectra were coadded to compute the expected spectrum of the echo ( at 670d the sn",
    "nebular spectrum is several magnitudes fainter than the echo and does not give a measurable contribution ) .",
    "this is compared with the observed spectrum in fig .",
    "3 . given the crudeness of some of the assumptions and the incomplete spectral coverage of the near - maximum phase , the agreement between the observations and the model is excellent , which we consider a strong argument in favor of the light echo scenario .    moreover , even if we stress that similar results can be obtained for different geometries , the fact that with the configuration we have chosen it is possible to explain the observed light curve , spectrum and reddening is suggestive .",
    "the observation and interpretation of light echos can tell us about dust properties and distribution in galaxies , but may have far - reaching applications and consequences .",
    "one such application is to measure distances of galaxies @xcite .",
    "sn  1998bu is only the second type ia sn for which a light echo was observed , the other being sn  1991 t in the sbc galaxy ngc  4527 .",
    "it is remarkable that both sne are very slow decliners .",
    "sn  1991 t was also spectroscopically peculiar at and before maximum , indicating a higher photospheric temperature than in normal sne  ia , as shown by the presence of strong feiii lines and by the absence of feii lines before maximum @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed by spectroscopic modeling , which also revealed that sn  1991 t had an abnormally high abundance of fe - group species in the outer , fast - moving part of the ejecta @xcite .",
    "such a peculiar element distribution suggested that sn  1991 t may have been the result of an unusual explosion mechanism .",
    "further studies revealed that sn  1991 t had very broad fe nebular lines @xcite .",
    "this and the brightness of the sn at maximum led various authors to conclude that sn  1991 t produced an unusually large amount of @xmath18ni , about 1 m@xmath55@xcite though this may be challenged by recent calibration of the sn absolute luminosity @xcite . finally , @xcite suggested that sn  1991 t may have been the result of the explosion of a super - chandrasekhar mass progenitor .",
    "1998bu shares many of the properties of sn  1991 t : it was bright at maximum , it had a slow decline and broad nebular lines , although not quite as extreme in these respect as sn  1991 t .",
    "it is therefore very interesting that both sne are significantly reddened and show a dust echo .",
    "other two nearby sne  ia were heavily reddened : sn  1989b was a normal sn  ia for which indeed there may be some evidence of a light echo @xcite , while sn  1986 g was a fast decliner and spectroscopically peculiar object for which , despite an early claim @xcite , there was no evidence of a light echo @xcite .",
    "the latter requires that the dust was more distant from sn  1986 g than in sn  1998bu or sn  1991 t",
    "( by placing the dust cloud 10 times further the echo magnitude becomes 2.5 mag fainter ) .",
    "historically , the fact that sn  ia were seen as very homogeneous was attributed to their progenitors arising from a single stellar population . adding to this that sn  ia were found in all types of galaxies , even in ellipticals , contributed to the standard paradigm that the progenitors of all sn  ia belong to the old stellar population .",
    "now there is evidence that slow decliners ( or high luminosity sn  ia ) may be preferably associated with a younger stellar population ( and therefore conceivably more massive progenitors ) , a suggestion first made by @xcite and confirmed by @xcite .",
    "our result that both sn  1991 t and sn  1998bu are located close to dusty regions is coherent with this scenario .",
    "obviously one needs to improve the statistics by adding more cases . in this respect",
    "one interesting object is sn  1998es .",
    "this is a sn  ia whose spectrum near maximum was very similar to that of sn  1991 t @xcite and shows the signature of quite similar interstellar reddening ( patat et al . in preparation ) .",
    "therefore sn  1998es maybe an interesting candidate to search for light echo though , because of the relatively large distance ( @xmath56 ) , the apparent magnitude may result quite faint ( v@xmath57 if the echo has the same intensity as in sn  1991 t and sn  1998bu ) .",
    "the peculiar late light curve and spectrum of sn  1998bu are attributed to the echo from circumstellar dust of the light emitted near maximum . based on a simple modelling and on the comparison with sn  1991 t ( which also experienced a similar phenomenom ) we estimate that the dust cloud is located in front of the sn and relatively nearby ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "because of the similar echo luminosity but much higher optical depth of the dust in sn  1998bu compared with sn  1991 t , we expect that the dust layer is more distant and hence the echo ring of sn  1998bu grows faster than in sn  1991 t ."
