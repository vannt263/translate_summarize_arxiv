    "the problem of a single particle interacting with its environment is encountered frequently in condensed matter physics , and in many variations .",
    "such scenarios appear in the form of genuine defects in materials , like magnetic impurities in metals and the associated ubiquitous kondo problem.@xcite impurity problems are also often used as a stepping stone to gain insight into the behavior of strongly correlated systems , such as studying a single hole doped into a mott insulator helps understanding some properties of high - temperature superconductors.@xcite    in recent years , impurity problems have also started to gain some attention in the context of ultracold atomic gases . amongst others ,",
    "the fermionic polaron problem has been studied thoroughly in connection with strongly imbalanced fermi gases close to a feshbach resonance,@xcite where a single `` spin - down '' atom interacting with a fermi sea of `` spin - up '' atoms appears as a polaronic quasiparticle and eventually forms a two - particle bound - state with one of the majority atoms if the interactions are strong enough.@xcite more generally , such polaronic problems appear when we consider the nature of the threshold of spectral functions of gapped excitations above many - body ground states.@xcite    here we are interested in a seemingly similar problem , where a mobile impurity is coupled to a continuum of gapless excitations at a quantum critical point , instead of gapless particle - hole excitations at a fermi surface .",
    "in particular , we want to study the situation where bosons in an optical lattice are tuned to the superfluid - mott insulator transition,@xcite and a single atom of a different species is coupled to the bosons via a density - density interaction .",
    "this scenario is especially interesting due to the recent experimental implementation of quantum - gas microscopes,@xcite which allow tracking the motion of the impurity through the bosonic bath .",
    "indeed , a recent combined experimental and theoretical work has addressed a very similar situation in an effectively one - dimensional system.@xcite we are going to focus on the other experimentally relevant , two dimensional situation instead . from our perspective , this case also happens to be the most interesting scenario , because in @xmath0 spatial dimensions the critical behavior at the sf - mi transition is described by a non - trivial fixed point without well - defined quasiparticle excitations.@xcite recently there has been a renewed interest in this particular transition as experiments succeeded in observing the so - called higgs amplitude mode.@xcite    the main motivation for our work is the prospect of studying aspects of quantum critical transport in a clean , well - defined experimental setting . calculating transport coefficients of systems close to a quantum phase transition remains a challenging problem in theoretical condensed matter physics .",
    "the main reason is that all traditional methods for calculating transport properties rely on a quasiparticle picture of the low - energy excitations above the ground - state , which breaks down at a quantum critical point .",
    "indeed , strongly coupled conformal field theories ( cft ) that describe physical properties of physical systems close to quantum critical points typically have no well defined quasiparticle excitations .",
    "some progress has been made recently using the so called ads / cft correspondence , which circumvents this problem by mapping the strongly coupled cft to a dual , weakly coupled gravitational theory , where transport coefficients can be computed reliably.@xcite    in this paper our main interest is to calculate the diffusion constant @xmath1 of the impurity as a function of temperature in the quantum critical regime , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] . this diffusion constant can be measured directly in experiments with quantum - gas microscopes by evaluating the mean square displacement @xmath2 of the impurity atom from its initial position after a time @xmath3 @xmath4 where the brackets denote an average over many experimental realizations and the time @xmath5 has to be larger than the typical collision time @xmath6 , below which the impurity propagates ballistically .",
    "several theoretical works have addressed similar questions using the holographic correspondence in the context of a heavy quark moving through a quark gluon plasma.@xcite here we will use a conventional method based on the boltzmann equation , however , which turns out to provide an adequate description at low temperatures .",
    "the quantum criticality of the bulk critical point has a single characteristic time which controls transport and relaxational processes close to equilibrium @xmath7.@xcite we will show here that the situation with impurity motion is not as universal , and the impurity time scale is determined by an interplay between several couplings which are formally irrelevant at the critical point .",
    "one of the these couplings is the inverse effective mass , @xmath8 , of the mobile impurity ; there is the associated energy scale @xmath9 , where @xmath10 the velocity of the bulk bosonic excitations at the critical point .",
    "the value of @xmath11 controls the quantum wave packet spread of the impurity at short times .",
    "the other `` irrelevant '' parameters couple the impurity to the bulk excitations , and associated energy scales determine the diffusion of the impurity at long times even at the lowest temperatures .",
    "one of our interesting results is that the diffusion constant of the impurity does _ not _ depend on @xmath11 at low temperatures , however .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec",
    ": ft ] we derive an effective low energy theory for a mobile impurity coupled to bosons at the superfluid  mott - insulator ( sf - mi ) transition and we show that the presence of three - body interactions changes the theory significantly at the particle - hole symmetric point . in section [ sec:2p ]",
    "we study perturbative self - energy corrections to the impurity propagator and calculate its diffusion constant as a function of temperature , neglecting three - body interactions .",
    "we repeat these calculations including three - body interactions in section [ sec:3p ] and show that this changes the results qualitatively at low temperatures .",
    "finally we perform a renormalization group analysis of the effective field theory in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg ] .",
    "we start by deriving the effective low - energy theory for a bose - hubbard model at the sf - mi critical point in @xmath0 spatial dimensions , following ref .  .",
    "a convenient starting point is to consider particle- and hole- excitations on top of a mott insulating state , which are described by the lagrangian @xmath12 here the fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent particle- and hole excitations on top of a state with an integer filling of bosons .",
    "the respective energy gaps for these excitations are denoted by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , their effective masses by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the last term in eq .   creates or annihilates particles and holes in pairs , as required by the conservation of the total number of bosons , and we do not explicitly show higher order terms in the fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 that are allowed by symmetry .",
    "ultimately we are interested in the experimentally relevant situation where the transition happens at a constant density , i.e.  at the tip of the mott - lobe .",
    "this happens only if the gaps @xmath15 and @xmath16 are equal , such that particles and holes condense at the same time when the gap closes .",
    "for the moment we will consider the general case , however , and parametrize the gaps as @xmath21 now we add a single , mobile impurity atom to the bosons , the dynamics of which is described by the free particle lagrangian @xmath22 where the field @xmath23 represents the impurity and the chemical potential @xmath24 has to be adjusted such that the density of impurities is zero .",
    "this is important only at finite temperatures , however , where we need to ensure that no artificial , thermally excited impurities exist . at zero temperature",
    "we can safely set @xmath25 .    within a microscopic bose - hubbard like model",
    "the coupling between the impurity and the bosons is an onsite density - density interaction , which is a pure two - body interaction in the simplest case .",
    "since the local boson density is given by the difference between particle- and hole- densities ( up to the constant average number of bosons that we neglect in the following , as it only renormalizes the impurity s chemical potential ) , the interaction term in our effective field theory takes the form @xmath26 where the subscript @xmath27 of the coupling constant @xmath28 indicates that this term derives from a two - body interaction .",
    "furthermore we include a term that descends from a three - body interaction @xmath29 because in the case of particle - hole symmetry ( @xmath30 ) this interaction generates couplings that are _ more _ relevant in an rg sense than those deriving from two - body interactions only , as will be shown below . to avoid confusion we note that a three - body interaction in the bose - hubbard model of the form @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the number of bosons on site @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the impurity creation operator , also generates a term of the form in addition to",
    ". for brevity we will always refer to the term in as the three - body interaction , however .",
    "eventually our system is described by the total lagrangian @xmath35 in order to arrive at the more familiar low energy theory for the sf - mi critical point we define the fields @xmath36 and integrate out the field @xmath37 . after a rescaling of @xmath38 and defining @xmath39 as well as @xmath40",
    "we arrive at our final result @xmath41 the terms shown are the leading order terms within a gradient expansion . for the case of particle - hole symmetry ( @xmath42 , i.e.  @xmath43 ) the dynamical critical exponent of the bosons is @xmath44 and the critical point is described by the well known @xmath45 cft in @xmath46 dimensions .",
    "even more interesting , the direct interaction term between the bosons and the impurity @xmath47 vanishes if only two - body interactions are present .",
    "this somewhat counterintuitive result ( in the sense that the particle - hole symmetric interaction term vanishes if the @xmath48-theory is particle - hole symmetric ) can be understood from the fact that the two - body interaction term @xmath49 is invariant under a particle - hole transformation ( @xmath50 ) _ only _ in combination with @xmath51 .",
    "this is not true for the three - body interaction term @xmath52 , however , and that is why the parametrically smaller @xmath53 generates a term that is more relevant than the one generated by two - body interactions at the particle - hole symmetric point .",
    "the leading order terms that are consistent with the symmetry",
    "@xmath54 = \\mathcal{l}[\\psi^ * ; -\\delta ,- u_2,u_3 ] \\label{syms}\\ ] ] are the ones shown in eq .  .",

    "we stress again that we focus solely on the particle - hole symmetric case ( @xmath30 ) in the rest of the paper .",
    "a tree - level scaling analysis of the lagrangian using the exact critical exponents of the bosonic cft shows that both interactions @xmath28 and @xmath53 are irrelevant in @xmath0 spatial dimensions at the p / h - symmetric point .",

    "[ sec : rg ] .",
    "in this section we analyze the field theory at the particle - hole symmetric point ( @xmath30 ) , assuming that three body interactions are absent ( i.e.  @xmath68 ) .",
    "the lagrangian thus takes the simplified form @xmath69 note that we dropped the chemical potential since it is not important at zero temperature , as argued above .      as a first step towards an understanding of the impurity s properties we calculate its self - energy perturbatively in the interaction strength @xmath28 at zero temperature in the following .",
    "since @xmath28 is irrelevant , we expect the perturbative calculation to give qualitatively correct results .",
    "the terms up to second order are shown in fig .",
    "the first order tadpole contribution turns out to be identically zero .",
    "note that the boson loop in the second order diagram corresponds to the time - like component of the bosonic current - current correlation function of the free bosonic theory due to the particular form of the interaction vertex in . at @xmath70 the form of the bosonic current - current correlator of the interacting @xmath48-theory at the critical point in @xmath0",
    "is fixed by conformal invariance and is given by @xmath71 here @xmath72 is a numerical factor that is renormalized by the boson interaction @xmath73 and takes the value @xmath74 for the free bosonic theory .",

    "the qualitative change of the self - energy at @xmath82 can be understood from kinematic considerations . the only lifetime limiting process for the impurity at zero temperature happens to be the excitation of a bosonic `` phonon '' mode . due to energy- and momentum conservation this process",
    "is prohibited as long as the group velocity of the impurity @xmath83 is smaller than the `` sound '' velocity @xmath10 of the bosons .",
    "for this reason the impurity spectral function has a sharp delta - function peak for all momenta @xmath84 , which is reflected by the fact that the imaginary part of the self energy scales as @xmath85 close to the quasiparticle pole . on the other hand , for @xmath86 the impurity can scatter strongly by exciting the bosons .",
    "consequently the imaginary part takes a non - zero on - shell value , implying that there is no well defined impurity excitation anymore .",
    "the appearance of this kinematic constraint can be readily seen from eq .  , where the imaginary part of the current correlator is non - zero only if @xmath87 .",
    "it is important to note that this threshold behavior for creating bosonic excitations at @xmath88 holds to all orders in perturbation theory in the impurity - boson coupling @xmath28 .",
    "higher order diagrams with more boson propagators describe processes where the impurity excites multiple boson modes , which in turn have an even higher energetic threshold . from a theoretical perspective",
    "it is an interesting question , if the impurity s properties above this kinematic threshold at @xmath82 are described by a rg fixed point .",
    "this is not the case , however , and we will come back to this problem in sec .  [",

    "together with the band mass @xmath99 of the impurity , we obtain @xmath100 , which is typically well below the kinematic threshold .",

    "in typical experimental situations the impurity is initially localized , released at some time @xmath112 and then is allowed to propagate through the bosonic bath . in principle",
    "the boltzmann equation allows to calculate the full time evolution of the impurity distribution function . at short times collisions",

    "here we used the one loop result for the bosonic current correlator @xmath123 at finite temperature , where the dispersion relation of the bosonic modes @xmath124 acquires a temperature dependent mass term @xmath125 which follows from a @xmath126 expansion in the limit @xmath127 of the bosonic cft.@xcite note that this temperature dependent gap is an artifact of the @xmath127 limit and it is not the scope of this paper to go beyond this limitation .    at a fixed temperature @xmath90 , the diffusion constant @xmath1 takes its minimal value in the quantum critical regime directly above the quantum critical point , where the mott gap vanishes ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the naive expectation that the phase space for scattering processes between the impurity and the bosonic modes is large , if the gap of the bosonic modes is small .",
    "the scaling function in the quantum critical regime for @xmath128 is shown in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : phij ] .",
    "note that @xmath122 approaches a finite value @xmath129 at zero temperature and scales linearly for small @xmath130 , as @xmath131 interestingly , the fact that the scaling function takes a constant value at @xmath70 and @xmath128 implies that the diffusion constant at the critical point does not depend on the impurity mass @xmath11 at very low temperatures .",
    "indeed , the curvature of the impurity dispersion , _ i.e. _  the inverse mass @xmath132 , is an irrelevant perturbation , and here there is no conspiracy between the two irrelevant couplings @xmath132 and @xmath28 that potentially could change the @xmath90 dependence of @xmath1 from that expected from its @xmath133 dependence . only at higher temperatures the mass starts to play a role , leading to a crossover from a @xmath134 behavior at very low temperatures to a @xmath135 dependence at temperatures @xmath136 .",
    "note that this crossover temperature is around the typical temperatures in experiments , where @xmath137 , thus we expect that the @xmath135 behavior at larger temperatures should be easily accessible .    in order to compare our results directly to experiments it would be natural to express the diffusion constant in units of the hopping amplitude @xmath96 ( or more precisely @xmath138 , if the lattice constant @xmath139 and planck s constant are not set to unity ) .",
    "assuming that the hubbard interaction @xmath28 between the impurity and the bosons equals the hubbard-@xmath94 in the bulk , the diffusion constant at a typical temperature @xmath140 above the critical point takes the value @xmath141 .",
    "the corresponding transport relaxation time @xmath6 takes the value @xmath142 , showing that it is experimentally promising to reach the diffusive regime at times @xmath5 .",
    "we note here that in certain parameter regimes a direct comparison of experimental results with our calculations might be difficult due to the harmonic confinement in experiments .",
    "this confinement effectively leads to an averaging of the diffusion constant when the impurity explores different regions of the trap . in most cases",
    "this is not a problem , however . only in the mott regime at temperatures well below the mott gap , where the diffusion constant is large and the impurity propagates almost ballistically , it explores larger regions of the trap and averaging",
    "could become important .",
    "such confinement problems can be circumvented by increasing the temperature slightly , since @xmath1 and @xmath6 are strongly temperature dependent and decrease by an order of magnitude if the temperature is raised from @xmath143 to @xmath144 .",
    "on a formal level , the fact that the scaling function at the critical point @xmath145 is constant can be traced back to the behavior of the current correlator at small frequencies , which scales as @xmath146 for @xmath147 .",
    "it is important to stress that this behavior , which is related to the fact that @xmath148 is an odd function of frequency and expected to be an analytic at @xmath149 , is likely valid in general and not related to our one - loop approximation of the current correlator .",
    "indeed it has been argued that the current - current correlation function takes a hydrodynamic form for @xmath150 @xmath151 the imaginary part of which obviously scales as @xmath152 for small frequencies .",
    "this has also been confirmed by calculations using the ads / cft correspondence.@xcite    in the mott regime away from the critical point , where the excitation gap @xmath91 is finite , the scaling function diverges exponentially as the temperature approaches zero @xmath153 this behavior can be understood from the fact that the impurity does not scatter with bosonic excitations at temperatures well below the mott gap and thus propagates ballistically , which translates to a diverging diffusion constant .",
    "we also note that the mobility @xmath154 of the impurity is independent of its mass at the critical point at low enough temperatures .",
    "the mobility is defined as @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the impurity s terminal drift velocity in response to an external force @xmath157 .",
    "it is related to the diffusion constant @xmath1 via the einstein relation @xmath158 and thus has the same dependence on the impurity mass as the diffusion constant .      in the superfluid phase",
    "the impurity diffusion constant @xmath1 can be calculated in the same way as in sec .",
    "[ sec : boltz2 ] , using a @xmath126 expansion in the limit @xmath127 for the bosonic current correlation function @xmath123 .",
    "the only difference is that eq .   for the boson mass term",
    "has to be replaced by@xcite @xmath159 in contrast to the mott regime , where the energy scale is set by the mott gap @xmath91 , the energy scale @xmath160 in the superfluid phase is set by the helicity modulus at zero temperature @xmath161.@xcite    in the @xmath126 expansion , the helicity modulus is non - zero only at @xmath70 , and the o(@xmath162 ) symmetry is fully restored at any non - zero temperature .",
    "however , for the @xmath163 case of interest here , the helicity modulus is non - zero for a range of low @xmath90 : the helicity modulus @xmath164 is proportional to the superfluid density @xmath165 , and close to the quantum critical point , @xmath166 is a universal function of @xmath167 and @xmath90 .",
