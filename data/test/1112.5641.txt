    "this can be mapped globally to the horizontal one - form @xmath111 , which is proportional to the cartan one - form known from finsler geometry and is a lagrangian analogue of the poincar one - form in hamiltonian mechanics .",

    "we will now discuss the measurement procedure in more detail and present the example of how an observer measures the speed of light .",
    "definition 2 of the observer frame includes the statement that a physical observable is given by the components of a horizontal tensor field with respect to the observer s frame , evaluated at her position on the tangent bundle , i.e. , at her position on the manifold and her four - velocity .",
    "the motivation for this is as follows .",
    "the geometry of finsler spacetimes is formulated on the tangent bundle @xmath7 , and hence matter tensor fields coupling to this gravitational background must also be defined over @xmath7 .",
    "not all such tensor fields can be interpreted as tensor fields from the perspective of the spacetime manifold @xmath1 .",
    "this interpretation requires that the tensor fields be horizontal ; then they are multilinear maps built on the horizontal space @xmath149 and its dual which are identified with the tangent space @xmath150 and its dual .",
    "consider the example of a 2-form field @xmath151 over @xmath7 ; in the horizontal / vertical basis this expands as @xmath152 only the purely horizontal part @xmath153 has a clear interpretation .",
    "note that such horizontal tensor fields are automatically d - tensor fields , and have the same number of components as a tensor field of same rank on @xmath1 .",
    "the difference is that the components depend on the tangent bundle position .",
    "the measurement of a horizontal tensor field by an observer at the tangent bundle position @xmath154 clearly requires an observer frame of @xmath104 in order to read out the components .",
    "we emphasize that the dependence of observables on the four - velocity of the observer is not surprising .",
    "neither is it problematic as long as observers can communicate their results . in general relativity , observables are the components of tensor fields over @xmath1 with respect to the observer s frame in @xmath108 ; they clearly depend on @xmath101 which induces the splitting of @xmath108 into time and space directions . on finsler spacetimes",
    "the dependence of observables on the observer s four - velocity is not only present in the time / space split of @xmath104 , but also in the argument of the tensor field components .    as a simple example we discuss the measurement of the spatial velocity of a point particle that moves on a worldline @xmath155 with horizontal tangent @xmath156",
    "this can be expanded in the orthonormal frame of an observer as @xmath157 , where we recall that @xmath158 is the observer s four velocity . the time @xmath159 passes while the particle moves in spatial direction @xmath160 , so the spatial velocity @xmath161 and its square @xmath162 are @xmath163    as a consequence of this formula we may derive the speed of light seen by a given observer . as discussed in  @xcite light propagates on null worldlines @xmath155 with @xmath164 which is equivalent to @xmath165 .",
    "we can use this fact to replace the finsler metric in the formula for the velocity above .",
    "taylor expanding @xmath166 around @xmath167 yields @xmath168 evaluating this formula at the position of the observer @xmath169 and dividing by @xmath170 , we immediately obtain an expression for the speed of light @xmath171 , i.e. , the speed of light traveling in spatial direction @xmath172 and measured by the observer @xmath154 : @xmath173 the @xmath159 are determined by solving the null condition @xmath174 ; on a generic finsler spacetime there can be more than one solution since the null structure can be very complicated . from equation  ( [ eq : speedlight ] )",
    "we see that the measured speed of light depends on the higher than second order derivatives of the squared finsler function ; these vanish in the metric limit where we thus reobtain @xmath175 independent of the observer and the spatial direction of the light ray .",
    "the formulae  ( [ eq : v2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : light ] ) enable us to compare experimental results on particle and light velocities with predictions on specific finsler spacetime models . in  @xcite we used this to study the possibility of superluminal particle propagation .",
    "we already stressed the importance that observers should be able to communicate their measurements .",
    "consider two observers whose worldlines meet at a point @xmath176 . since observers by definition  2 measure the components of horizontal tensor fields in their frame and at their tangent bundle position , we need to determine which transformation uniquely maps an observer frame @xmath147 in @xmath52 to a second observer frame @xmath177 in @xmath178 .",
    "their respective four - velocities , or time directions , @xmath179 and @xmath180 generically are different , so that the two observer frames are objects in tangent spaces to @xmath7 at different points . as a consequence , we will now demonstrate that the transformations between observers consist of two parts : the first is a transport of the frame @xmath147 from @xmath181 to @xmath182 , the second will turn out to be a lorentz transformation .",

    "finsler spacetimes generalize lorentz invariance instead of violating it .    as a further formal development we presented definition  4 of symmetries of finsler spacetimes and theorem  4 that shows some of their basic properties .",
    "we applied this notion to determine the most general fundamental geometry functions consistent with spherical , cosmological , or maximal symmetry .",
    "maximally symmetric finsler spacetimes are in fact maximally symmetric metric spacetimes , and the only maximally symmetric source - free vacuum solution of finsler gravity is minkowski spacetime . as a concrete application of the results of this article we studied a simple spherically symmetric bimetric perturbation around this flat metric vacuum .",
    "we found a first order solution of the finsler gravity equation which is a refinement of the linearized schwarzschild solution of einstein gravity . with a special choice of the parameters in our solution",
    "the resulting geodesics are identical to those of linearized schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "this demonstrates that weak field gravitational experiments may not be sufficient to distinguish finsler spacetimes from lorentzian metric spacetimes .",
    "but we saw that the full set of parameters in our model solution could be capable to resolve the fly - by anomaly in the solar system .",
