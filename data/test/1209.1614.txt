    "in quantum chromodynamics , factorization is a fundamental concept .",

    "( [ ope - expan ] ) ) , and the coefficient - functions and matrix elements of non - local operators of the operator product expansion at high energy , contain perturbative and non perturbative contributions .",

    "the evolution in rapidity of these operators is known as the balitsky - equation@xcite : a non - linear evolution equation which generates a hierarchy of coupled equations known as the balitsky - hierarchy@xcite ( for a review see ) . in the color glass condensate formalism",
    "it coincides with the jimwlk evolution equation@xcite . in the large @xmath3 limit , instead",
    ", the balitsky - equation decouples and is written in a closed form that is known , in dis case , as the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation@xcite .",

    "the propagation of the quark anti - quark pair in the background of a shock wave , reduces to two wilson lines .",
