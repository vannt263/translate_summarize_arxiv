    "the recent development of a theoretical framework for deeply virtual exclusive scattering processes using the concept of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) has opened vast opportunities for understanding and interpreting hadron structure _ including spin _ within qcd . among the many important consequences",
    "is the fact that differently from both inclusive and semi - inclusive processes , gpds can in principle provide essential information for determining the missing component to the nucleon longitudinal spin sum rule , which is identified with orbital angular momentum .",
    "a complete description of nucleon structure requires , however , also the transversity ( chiral odd / quark helicity - flip ) gpds , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 @xcite . just as in the case of the forward transversity structure function , @xmath7 ,",
    "the transversity gpds are expected to be more elusive quantities , not easily determined experimentally .",
    "it was nevertheless suggested in ref.@xcite that deeply virtual exclusive neutral pion electroproduction can provide a direct channel to measure chiral - odd gpds so long as the helicity flip ( @xmath8 ) contribution to the quark - pion vertex is dominant .",
    "this idea was borne amidst contrast , based on the objection that the @xmath9 coupling should be subleading compared to the leading twist , chiral - even ( @xmath10 ) contribution .",
    "it was subsequently , very recently , endorsed by qcd practitioners @xcite .",
    "furthermore , experimental data from jefferson lab hall b @xcite are now being interpreted in terms of chiral - odd gpds .",
    "what caused this change and made the transversity - based interpretation be accepted ?    within a qcd framework at leading order the scattering amplitude factors into a nucleon - parton correlator described by gpds , and a hard scattering part which includes the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) . keeping to a leading order description , the cross sections four - momentum squared dependences are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , for the longitudinal and transverse virtual photon polarizations , respectively .",
    "it is therefore expected that in the deep inelastic region @xmath13 will be dominant .",
    "experimental data from both jefferson lab @xcite and hera @xcite on meson electroproduction show exceedingly larger than expected transverse components of the cross section .",
    "clearly , an explanation lies beyond the reach of the leading order collinear factorization that was first put forth , and more interesting dynamics might be involved . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was noted that sufficiently large transverse cross sections can be produced in @xmath0 electroproduction provided the chiral odd coupling is adopted .",
    "since all available data are in the few gev kinematical region it should not be surprising to find such higher twist terms to be present .",
    "what makes it more difficult to accept is that the longitudinal components of the cross section should simultaneously be suppressed . also , given the trend of the hera data , why is this canonical higher twist effect seemingly not disappearing at even larger @xmath1 values ? in order to answer this question , in this paper we carefully address , one by one , the issues of the construction of helicity amplitudes and their connection with the cartesian basis ( section [ sec2 ] ) , the @xmath1-dependence ( section [ sec3 ] ) , the role of @xmath14-channel spin , parity , charge conjugation and their connection to the gpds crossing symmetry properties ( section [ sec4 ] ) , finally giving our conclusions in section [ sec5 ] .    .",

    "we conclude that spin can not be disregarded when evaluating the asymptotic trends of the cross section .",

    "the two sequences of @xmath175 and @xmath176 contribute equally to the chiral odd gpds and couple to the @xmath94 production .",
    "these sequences correspond to the @xmath177 ( vector ) and @xmath178 ( axial - vector ) mesons with even @xmath117 excitations .",
    "the decomposition into the @xmath14-channel of the matrix elements of the non - local quark correlators into the two distinct series of local operators lead us to distinguish two different dependences on @xmath1 of the @xmath0 coupling , @xmath179 ( @xmath177 series , lower left in table [ ttgpd ] , and @xmath180 ( @xmath178 series , lower right in table [ ttgpd ] ) as discussed in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "exclusive pseudo - scalar meson electroproduction is directly sensitive to leading twist chiral - odd gpds which can at present be extracted from available data in the multi - gev region .",
    "we examined and justified this proposition further by carrying out a careful analysis of some of the possibly controversial issues that had arisen . after going through a step by step derivation of the connection of the helicity amplitudes formalism with the cartesian basis",
    ", we showed how the dominance of the chiral - odd process follows unequivocally owing to the values allowed for the @xmath14-channel spin , parity , charge conjugation and from the gpds crossing symmetry properties .",
    "this observation has important consequences for the the @xmath1-dependence of the process .",
    "our @xmath2 analysis supports the separation between the @xmath1 dependence of the photo - induced transition functions for the even and odd parity combinations into @xmath94 thus reinforcing the idea that spin related observables exhibit a non trivial asymptotic behavior . finally , in an effort to streamline the otherwise cumbersome multi - variable dependent structure functions , we presented simplified formulae displaying leading order contributions of the gpds and their @xmath1 dependent multiplicative factors .",
    "a separation of the various chiral - odd gpds contributions can be carried out provided an approach that allows to appropriately fix their parameters and normalizations is adopted as the one we presented here .",
