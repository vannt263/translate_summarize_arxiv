    "boolean networks ( bns ) are a kind of discrete dynamical systems described by logical variables and logical functions .",
    "they are first proposed by kauffman ( 1969 ) to describe and analyze cell regulation ( albert & othmer , 2003 ; faure , naldi , chaouiya , & thieffry , 2006 ) .",
    "bns with additional inputs and outputs are usually called boolean control networks ( bcns ) , and they have been paid great attention by biologists and control theory scientists ( akutsu , hayashida , ching , & ng , 2007 ; cheng , 2009 ; ) . in recent years , a semi - tensor product method of bns and bcns was developed by cheng and his collaborators ( cheng , 2009 ; cheng & qi , 2009 ; cheng & qi , 2010a ) . for a complete control theory framework of the bcns , we refer to the book written by cheng , qi , and li ( 2011 ) .",
    "based on the linear algebraic expression of bcns , many classical problems in control theory can be generalized to bcns such as controllability , observability , stabilization , disturbance decoupling and optimal control ( cheng & qi , 2009 ; laschov & margaliot , 2012 ; laschov , margaliot , & even , 2013 ; fornasini & valcher , 2013a ; fornasini & valcher , 2013b ; cheng , 2011 ; zhao , li & cheng , 2011 ) .",
    "moreover , some of these results have be further extended to different kinds of bcns ( li , yang , & chu , 2014 ; li & sun , 2012 ; feng , yao , & cui , 2013 ; li & wang , 2012 ) .",
    "system decomposition is an important issue in the traditional linear control system theory , which makes clear the observable and controllable components of a system .",
    "an interesting topic is ascertaining whether there exists a similar system decomposition for bcns . as a matter of fact",
    ", this topic has been discussed by cheng , li and qi ( 2010 ) , where the controllable normal form , the observable normal form and the kalman decomposition form of bcns are presented with the state - space analysis method ( cheng & qi , 2010b ) .",
    "the state space of an @xmath0-dimensional bcn is defined as the set of all logical functions with respect to the @xmath0 logical variables .",
    "since the cardinal of the state space of an @xmath0-dimensional bcn is @xmath1 , generally speaking , the computational burden of state space method is very heavy for large @xmath0 although it displays great advantage in theoretical analysis .",
    "furthermore , some additional regularity assumptions are imposed on the system model for achieving those decompositions .    in our recent paper zou & zhu ( 2014 ) ,",
    "we have proposed the _ decomposition with respect to inputs _ for bcns , which is just the controllable normal form proposed by cheng , li and qi ( 2010 ) under the regularity assumption on the largest uncontrollable subspace .",
    "but we did not use any concepts of state spaces",
    ". a main contribution of zou & zhu ( 2014 ) lies in that the system decomposition can be realized without the regularity condition on the largest uncontrollable subspace .",
    "moreover , a graphical condition and a constructive algorithm for the decomposition with respect to inputs are proposed .",
    "then , a natural idea is reconsidering the observable normal form and the kalman decomposition form for bcns .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the decomposition with respect to outputs in the framework of the linear algebraic representation of bcns .",
    "first , some necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for the decomposition with respect to outputs are proposed .",
    "next , an equivalent graphical condition for the decomposition with respect to outputs is derived . as the graphical condition is satisfied ,",
    "a constructive coordinate transformation to realize the decomposition is obtained .",
    "then , a method is proposed to reduce the computational burden in realizing the decomposition with respect to outputs .",
    "finally , some examples are analyzed with our method .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "some preliminaries and problem statement are provided . in section 3 ,",
    "some algebraic conditions for the decomposition with respect to outputs are presented . in section 4 , a graphical condition is obtained . in section 5",
