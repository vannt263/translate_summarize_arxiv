    "in order to implement conditional quantum dynamics of qubits represented by the internal structure of individual ions in a paul trap , a vibrational mode of the entire ion string is used .",
    "cirac and zoller @xcite have suggested a method for conditional dynamics that requires the ions to be cooled to their vibrational ground state . here",
    ", the vibrational state represents a `` bus '' qubit that gets entangled with the ions internal states by stimulated transitions , where the absorption ( or emission ) of a photon is coupled with the emission ( or absorption ) of a vibrational quantum .    the recently proposed srensen - mlmer scheme @xcite incorporates two - photon transitions in order to directly entangle the internal states of the ions . here",
    ", the vibrational mode is only virtually excited . in this way the contribution of higher vibrational excitations can be made to destructively interfere . in this way",
    ", the scheme does not require cooling to the vibrational ground state , but admits population in higher vibrational levels .    in general , the manipulation of the motion of trapped particles by light relies on the coupling of electronic and motional degrees of freedom via the scattering of photons . here",
    ", the important figure of merit is the lamb - dicke parameter ( ldp ) @xmath4 , its square given by the ratio of the recoil energy transfered when scattering a photon , and the energy of the vibrational quantum @xcite . for small @xmath4 , transition processes involving the creation or annihilation of @xmath5 vibrational quanta ( i.e. @xmath5th order sideband transitions )",
    "are suppressed by the factor @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , a small ldp allows only linear coupling ( involving only single - phonon transitions ) between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "this jaynes - cummings type of coupling @xcite is prerequisite for many schemes suggested in quantum information processing including the mentioned implementations @xcite .",
    "plenio and knight @xcite have proposed to drive the interaction between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom by tuning _",
    "strong _ laser light to the resonance frequency , instead of the sideband .",
    "in this case , the light intensity imposes a specific light shift on the ions that selects the desired transition . by doing so ,",
    "the time needed for conditional dynamics is reduced , as compared with the cirac - zoller scheme , thus reducing the effect of decoherence . here ,",
    "too , the ldp plays a crucial role as the fidelity of such a fast quantum gate is @xmath7 .",
    "while the srensen - mlmer scheme does not require ground - state cooling , it still demands low vibrational quantum numbers ( ) .",
    "thus , laser cooling is essential for quantum information processing in ion traps , and it is desirable to have at hand robust cooling techniques that are suited for reaching low vibrational excitation at moderate technological expenditure on the side of the laser sources . in particular , cooling of the collective motion of several particles is prerequisite for implementing conditional quantum dynamics with trapped ions .",
    "it has been known for some time that the motion of trapped particles strongly depends on laser cooling . with a single trapped particle , distinct macroscopic motional states",
    "have been observed with different parameters of the cooling lasers @xcite . with a cloud of ions , changes in the temperature induced by laser cooling cause phase transitions between a crystalline and an evaporated state @xcite",
    "these macroscopically distinct states indicate the specific temperature achieved by laser cooling .    in this paper we investigate the macroscopic motional states of two trapped @xmath0ba@xmath1 under the action of laser cooling . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , the theory of laser cooling of the collective motion of two charged particles trapped in an anisotropic harmonic potential is outlined . if the particles obey the lamb - dicke limit , the cooling rate and the achievable temperature are calculable without any free parameter .",
    "we fully take into account the multilevel structure of the involved ions , thus allowing for any type of cooling process , such as doppler @xcite , sideband@xcite and raman cooling @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] we describe the experimental setup and present the results of the measurements .",
    "phase transitions between macroscopically distinct states are observed . the parameter values at which these transitions take place perfectly agree with the values calculated from the theoretical model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : optimize ] we use the model to find optimized laser parameters for cooling the collective motion of the ions .",
    "we consider the collective motion of two ions of mass @xmath8 in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) harmonic trapping potential @xmath9 which is the same for both ions ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "since each of the ions carries one positive elementary charge @xmath11 , they repel each other by the coulomb interaction @xmath12 the potential is simplified by using center - of - mass and relative coordinates @xmath13 with the definition of total and reduced masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 , one gets @xmath16 for the center - of - mass motion , corresponding to the motion of a single trapped particle with the original oscillation frequencies , but twice the ions mass .",
    "the potential for the relative motion is @xmath17 if the trap frequencies slightly differ ( as they do in our experiment , see table [ tab : ldp ] ) this potential does not show spherical symmetry . with @xmath18 holding , the potential has absolute minima on the @xmath19 axis and saddle points on the @xmath20 and @xmath21 axis at @xmath22{\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\;\\mu \\omega_q^2}}\\;{\\bf e}_q    \\quad,\\quad q = x , y , z\\;.\\ ] ]    figure [ fig : sattelpott ] shows the potential in the @xmath23 plane .",
    "it is clear that for high enough temperature , i.e. at a mean motional energy @xmath24 comparable with the potential barrier at the saddle point on the @xmath20-axis @xmath25{\\left(\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\right)^2\\mu}\\ ;    \\left(\\omega_y^{2/3}-\\omega_x^{2/3}\\right)\\;,\\ ] ] the ions can move freely in a ring - shaped region in the @xmath23 plane .",
    "however , at low temperature , the relative motion is restricted to the wells , i.e. , the ions will appear at approximately fixed positions .",
    "the same argument can be applied to the @xmath21-direction : for even higher energies @xmath26 the motional state changes from a ring to a sphere .",
    "all three motional states have been observed in our experiment .",
    "however , in the following we shall focus on the transition between the localized and the ring state , as we are mainly interested in laser cooling in the low - temperature regime .    in the localized state",

    "the corresponding cooling rate and steady - state temperature depend on the electronic level scheme and laser parameters ; they are calculated in this section .",
    "the key to the theory presented here is the well - known lamb - dicke limit : as long as the ions are localized near the minima of the potential , their spatial extension is much smaller than the wavelength of the exciting laser light . in this case",
    ", the photon recoil operator @xmath34 , i.e. the coupling of the the internal dynamics to the ions motion , can be expanded in the ldp . since the ldp is small , dynamics due to this coupling is slow compared with the internal dynamics that may be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "this reduction leads to a master equation for the motional degrees of freedom , where the involved transition rates depend on steady - state expectation values of internal operators .",
    "this procedure and its application to a single ba@xmath1 ion has been described in @xcite .",
    "we do not account for dipole - dipole interaction between the two ions , since the separation of the two ions is large as compared to the optical wavelengths used ( @xmath35 . ) even though processes caused by this interaction possibly could be observed @xcite , they are rare , compared with the single - ion scattering , and their influence on the collective motion is negligible .",
    "thus , we do not consider correlations between the two ions internal dynamics that would lead to cooperative effects such as superradiance .",
    "we rather calculate the cooling effect that each of the two ions individually has on the common motion .",
    "this effect is the same for both ions , since the foci of the lasers are wide compared with the distance of the ions ( the waist of the gaussian beams being @xmath36 ) , and therefore the laser intensities , and consequently laser cooling do not depend on the ions positions .",
    "we shall now give a short recap of the theory presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and apply its results to the collective motion of two ions in the current experiment .",
    "we start from the density operator @xmath37 for the motional and internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the dynamics is described by the master equation @xmath38 +    { \\cal l}\\varrho(t)\\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the liouvillean allowing for spontaneous emission .",

    "the ion s dipole interaction with the laser light can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the rabi frequency of the light driving the transition @xmath43 .",
    "summing over both ions , and rewriting the dipole interaction in terms of center - of - mass and relative coordinates [ ( eq .  [ eq : cm_rm ] ) ] , gives @xmath51 note that the center - of - mass and relative motions are coupled via the interaction with the laser light .",
    "however , in the lamb - dicke limit this coupling can be neglected , as @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are small and the potential can be expanded .",
    "this expansion is characterized by the lamb - dicke parameters @xmath54 for the center - of - mass modes and @xmath55 for the normal modes of the relative motion . in the experiment ,",
    "all ldps are much smaller than unity , see table [ tab : ldp ] .",
    "now , we rewrite the coordinates in terms of the lowering and raising operators of the corresponding vibrational eigenmodes @xmath56 since the expansion is around the potential minimum , there is a constant phase factor @xmath57 , that is incorporated in the atomic transition operators @xmath58 . now , keeping only terms up to first order in ( any ) lamb - dicke parameter yields @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 have been used .",

    "additional information is derived from monitoring the motion of the two ions .",
    "depending on the detuning of the 650-nm laser , different motional states are observed .",
    "whereas the ions appear at fixed positions if the red laser is tuned below the lowest or well above the highest dark resonance , they form a ring - shaped distribution in the @xmath23 plane with certain intermediate detunings .    the lower part of fig .",

    "note the clear distinction of the localized state at @xmath95 mhz from the non - localized state only @xmath96 mhz away : phase transitions between the two observed motional states appear at very definite laser frequencies .",
    "obviously , the motional state of the ions depends on the ion temperature set by the laser cooling . in fig .",
    "[ fig : beob ] , the motional states observed at different detunings are shown together with the motional energies and cooling rates calculated from theory .",
    "the different motional states appear in distinct regions of detuning : the ions are observed in the fixed position for the detuning @xmath97 below @xmath98 mhz . at this limiting value",
    "a sharp phase transition occurs , and the ions form a ring when @xmath99 mhz @xmath100 mhz . at the upper boundary , they are cooled again to the fixed - position state .",
    "such a `` hot '' region appears with each dark resonance . at some values of the detuning ,",
    "e.g.  at @xmath101 mhz , the motion fluctuated between the fixed and the ring - shaped state , thus remaining indefinite .",
    "the motional energy has been calculated from the model presented in the preceding section , using the experimental values for the @xmath102-mode .",
    "this energy should be compared with the height of the potential barrier [ ( eq .  [ eq : pot_barrier ] ) ] , which for the given data is @xmath103ev . wherever the predicted temperature varies steeply upon detuning , a sharp transition is observed .",
    "this is the case , when the corresponding cooling rate changes from positive to negative , i.e. when the lasers actually heat the ion .",
    "laser heating appears at _ negative _ detunings of both lasers when raman transitions dominate the interaction . in the vicinity of the dark resonances ,",
    "the internal state consists of a coherent superposition of the s@xmath2 and the d@xmath3 states , forming an effective two level system .",
    "now , with both detunings being negative , and @xmath104 , the effective detuning of this raman transition is positive , and causes heating of the motion . here",
    ", @xmath105 is the difference in zeeman shifts of the involved sublevels that defines the resonance condition of the considered dark state .",
    "note that the transition to the ring state , at positive detunings from the raman resonances , appears where the expected energy is still considerable lower than the potential barrier .",
    "however , this does not contradict the model , which assumes the ions close to the potential minima .",
    "as soon as they are smeared out over a region of considerable size , the harmonic approximation around the minimum no longer holds .",
    "the cooling gets less effective for the broadened velocity distribution .",
    "this happens when the thermal energy is substantially lower than @xmath106 .",
    "still , the observed phase transitions agree very well with the results of the model .    at low speed of scanning , for example , @xmath107 mhz / s , we observed hysteresis effects : the motional state upon up - tuning the laser frequency differed from the state observed upon down - tuning . however , this effect vanished when the scanning rate was decreased .",
    "scans at a very low speed ( @xmath108 mhz / s ) showed that the motional state solely depends on the laser parameters . therefore , a steady state exists , which is approached in a finite motional relaxation time .",
    "the final temperature is , in principle , not only set by the laser cooling , but it is subject to additional heating mechanisms , such as fluctuations in the trapping electric field .",
    "however , the calculated transition rates @xmath109 s@xmath110 equal the number of scattered phonons per unit time , and thus exceed the rate of parasitic heating ( @xmath111 s@xmath110 ) observed in ion trap experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , this additional heating can be neglected as long as the ions are kept laser - cooled .",
    "the discussed model is now employed to numerically investigate the influence of various parameters on the laser cooling , and to find optimized conditions for effective and robust cooling .",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath112 , since it is less affected by perturbations from stray fields of the trap @xcite and therefore is suitable for serving as a bus mode between the ions . a promising candidate for implementing qubits in trapped ba@xmath1",
    "is the s@xmath2-d@xmath113 ( 1762 nm ) transition @xcite .",
    "the ldp corresponding to this infrared transition is smaller than those of other transitions ( see table [ tab : ldp ] ) , and the srensen - mlmer criterion @xmath114 yields the condition @xmath115 that is easily fulfilled in practice . in fact , a mean phonon number @xmath116 can be reached : this is shown in the middle part of fig .",
    "[ fig : apamin1 ] , where @xmath117 is plotted vs the detuning of the 650-nm light .",
    "the lowest vibrational excitation was found by randomly searching the 4d parameter space for the lowest achievable @xmath117 .",
    "then , three laser parameters were kept constant , while the red - laser detuning was varied , in order to generate the graph .",
    "the minimal temperature is achieved around @xmath118 mhz .",
    "note that the lowest value @xmath119 indicated by the vertical dotted line does not match a particularly large cooling rate , as is shown in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : apamin1 ] .",
    "looking at the expected fluorescence signal ( upper part of the figure ) , which corresponds to the population of the p@xmath2 level , we note that the optimum detuning is on the red side of the dark resonance at @xmath120 mhz , as is expected for raman cooling .",
    "the dark resonance is power broadened by the high intensity at 650 nm . on the other hand",
    ", we find low temperatures only for low intensity of the 493-nm light .",
    "this fact indicates that scattering of the blue light is the dominant heating mechanism .",
    "we do not claim to have found the absolute minimum of achievable temperature : other sets of laser parameters may yield similarly low temperatures , and also the applied magnetic field to some degree influences the achievable temperature .",
    "we have restricted the parameter search to the range of negative detuning .",
    "even lower energies may be reached with both lasers detuned to the blue side of the atomic resonance and the parameters adjusted to yield so - called electromagnetically induced transparency cooling @xcite . here , the dynamic stark contribution to the nonlinear susceptibility dominates the interaction of ions and light @xcite .",
    "however , doppler precooling is still necessary and the lasers must either be switched from negative to positive detuning , or else additional light sources are required . moreover ,",
    "the intensities of the lasers must be precisely controlled , since for this type of cooling to work , the dynamic stark shift should match the vibrational frequency particularly well",
    ". however , cooling mechanisms are desirable , that are more robust against variations of intensity and detuning of the laser light , and thus are easier to implement experimentally .",
    "the robustness of the cooling is affected by the sharp boundaries between parameter regimes of very low and high temperature , because in these regions any drift of the lasers frequencies may cause drastic deterioration of the cooling . in order to find `` safe '' parameters we repeated the search , incorporating a tentative drift in the following way : for a given point in the @xmath121 parameter plane ,",
    "@xmath117 was calculated at this point and at eight additional points , where one or both of the detunings differ by @xmath122 mhz , and then averaged over the @xmath117 values at all nine points .",
    "the best robust parameters found differ from the ones used to calculate fig .",
    "[ fig : apamin1 ] and the achievable ion temperature is not as low as in the ideal situation , but one still finds @xmath123 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : apamin_bad ] , where the mean phonon number is shown as a function of @xmath97 ( solid line ) . the dotted line shows , for comparison , the vibrational excitation that is achieved with the same parameters , when the averaging over nine points is _ not _ carried out .",
    "the regions of safe cooling are narrower , since detuning close to a  boundary \" between cooling and heating is penalized .",
    "it seems not advisable to use a rather narrow region of cooling ( as , for example , close to @xmath124 mhz ) , because spurious laser drift might easily impose unexpected heating .",
    "however , some regions [ e.g. @xmath125 to @xmath126 mhz and @xmath127 to @xmath128 mhz ] are broad enough to allow for some laser drift with satisfactory cooling .",
    "we have observed the effect of laser cooling and heating on the collective motion of two trapped ba@xmath1 ions by monitoring the macroscopic motional states of the ions .",
    "these states indicate the vibrational excitation , or temperature of the ions . in this way",
    ", raman heating is demonstrated that dominates on the blue side of the dark resonances ( i.e.  @xmath129 ) .",
    "the observed phase transitions are a remarkable macroscopic manifestation of dark states , i.e. of the coherent quantum superposition of atomic levels .",
    "raman cooling on the red side of the dark resonance is implied , though it is not directly observed with this method , since no macroscopic change of the motional state shows up .",
    "the good agreement of the calculated excitation with the experimental observations shows that the outlined theory describes well the laser cooling of the collective motion of the ions .",
    "the predicted cooling rates much exceed spurious heating rates of the vibrational motion , for example , from fluctuations of the trapping electric field .",
    "thus , such heating is negligible as long as the cooling light is on .",
    "the model comes with no free parameters ; however , it is applicable only if the ions are localized near their potential wells .",
    "nevertheless , this is not a strong restriction since this regime is supposed to be used in any experiment implementing conditional quantum dynamics .",
    "this allows us to identify parameter regimes that imply effective and robust laser cooling .",
    "we find that the collective motion can become cooled close to the ground state , if the dark resonances are not much broadened by laser power or fluctuations .",
    "but even when fluctuations in laser parameters are allowed for , low levels of temperature emerge that are suitable for quantum information processing using the scheme for conditional quantum dynamics suggested by srensen and mlmer @xcite .",
    "we note that the level scheme of ba@xmath1 has the same structure as , for example , ca@xmath1 @xcite , a type of ion often suggested , and the results obtained here are applicable , with appropriate modifications , to the cooling of these ions , too .",

    "<S> we study cooling of the collective vibrational motion of two @xmath0ba@xmath1 ions confined in an electrodynamic trap and irradiated by laser light close to the resonances s@xmath2-p@xmath2 ( 493 nm ) and p@xmath2-d@xmath3 ( 650 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the motional state of the ions is monitored by a spatially resolving photomultiplier . </S>",
    "<S> depending on detuning and intensity of the cooling lasers , macroscopically different motional states corresponding to different ion temperatures are observed . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive the ions temperature from detailed analytical calculations of laser cooling taking into account the zeeman structure of the energy levels involved . </S>",
    "<S> the observed motional states perfectly match the calculated temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> significant heating is observed in the vicinity of the dark resonances of the zeeman - split s@xmath2-d@xmath3 raman transitions . here </S>",
    "<S> two - photon processes dominate the interaction between lasers and ions . </S>",
    "<S> parameter regimes of laser light are identified that imply most efficient laser cooling .    2 </S>"
