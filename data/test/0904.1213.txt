    "quantum information theory is an area of scientific investigation that has witnessed an enormous progress in the last decade @xcite . in the framework of quantum information science , paradigmatic systems of condensed matter physics such as , e.g. ,",
    "spin chains and harmonic lattices , are analyzed from the point of view of their information content and ability to process and transfer information .",
    "fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics and probability , such as the shannon - von neumann entropy @xcite , play a central role in the quantification of bipartite quantum entanglement @xcite . on the other hand , exciting advances in quantum information research",
    "are in a sense paying back the debt : the mathematical and theoretical toolkit developed for the characterization and quantification of quantum entanglement has proven useful to tackle questions and improve our understanding in the investigation of strongly correlated systems and quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most interesting development stemming from the application of the tools of entanglement theory concerns the study of correlation scaling in diversely connected systems , with its relations to conformal field theory and the proof of longstanding conjectures on entropic area laws in spin and harmonic lattice systems @xcite .",
    "these investigations and the associated results are of fundamental interest because they allow to enhance the control and establish firmer bounds and limits of applicability on many important tools of simulation and numerical analysis of complex many - body systems , a fundamental task in condensed matter , such as the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithms @xcite , matrix product representations @xcite , the entanglement renormalization ansatz @xcite , and weighted graph states methods @xcite .",
    "the pioneering application of quantum information concepts to condensed matter was the observation that two - body entanglement , as quantified by the concurrence , in the ground state of a cooperative system , exhibits peculiar scaling features approaching a quantum critical point @xcite .",
    "these seminal studies helped to clarify that at quantum phase transitions @xcite , the dramatic change in the ground state of a many - body system is associated to , or reflected by , a change in the way that quantum fluctuations are correlated , that is , in the way entanglement is distributed among the elementary constituents .",
    "many recent efforts have thus been aimed at understanding the behavior of different measures of entanglement at quantum phase transitions , and assessing the corresponding enhancement of properties useful for applications in quantum technology and quantum engineering @xcite . however , since most entanglement measures can be often rewritten in terms of the conventional n - point correlation functions , the presence of a divergence in the former at quantum criticality can be directly traced back to a divergence in the latter @xcite , although in some particular instances entanglement - based studies allowed to discover novel types of phase transitions @xcite .    finally , a more technologically oriented product of the interaction between these two areas of research is the study of quantum spin chains as natural information carriers and distributors @xcite , able to realize tasks such as quantum state transfer @xcite and storage @xcite , possibly with maximal fidelity in chains with suitably engineered couplings and dynamics .",
    "quantum engineering and quantum technology are being indeed developed at a fast pace .",
    "quantum devices are vigorously pursued for applications ranging from nano - sciences to quantum computation and entanglement - enhanced metrology @xcite . despite a large variety of possible implementations involving different physical systems ,",
    "many relevant properties of such devices can be in fact investigated in a unified setting by appropriate mappings to quantum spin models @xcite .",
    "control of separability and entanglement in ground states of quantum spin models plays an important role in entanglement - enabled quantum technology applications , and needs to be characterized and quantified in different physical regimes @xcite . from a more fundamental perspective",
    ", the determination of exact solutions endowed with precisely known properties of separability or entanglement , can be of great relevance in the study of advanced models of condensed matter and cooperative systems that are in general not exactly solvable .    in this paper",
    "we exploit quantum information tools to tackle another important problem in condensed matter physics : the determination and characterization of exact ground states of cooperative systems characterized by the property of being in the form of a fully factorized , tensor product of single - particle pure states , with no quantum correlations between the individual constituents .",
    "historically , the occurrence of totally factorized ( unentangled ) ground states of quantum many - body systems was first discovered in the one - dimensional anisotropic heisenberg model with nearest - neighbor interactions by kurmann , thomas and mller @xcite , by adopting a direct method in terms of product state ansatz .",
    "this result was later re - derived and extended to two dimensions using quantum monte carlo numerical methods @xcite .",
    "the direct product - state ansatz method of kurmann , thomas and mller has been later extended to anisotropic rings with interactions of arbitrary range , by exploiting the observation that factorized ground states break the parity symmetry @xcite .",
    "complex quantum systems exhibiting cooperative behaviors , whose ground states are typically entangled @xcite , may thus admit , for some non trivial values of the hamiltonian parameters , a ground state which is completely separable .",
    "the occurrence of factorization at finite or even strong values of the couplings is thus an effect of a delicate balancing between interactions and external fields .",
    "the phenomenon of ground state factorization is particularly intriguing as it appears to be associated with the presence of an `` entanglement phase transition '' with no classical counterpart @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for the purposes of quantum engineering applications , that employ distributed entanglement in order to manipulate and transfer information @xcite , factorization points need to be exactly identified and either avoided , in order to guarantee the reliable implementation of quantum devices , or properly exploited for the dynamical creation of strongly entangled multipartite states of large assemblies of microsystems ( graph and cluster states ) . finally , and also quite importantly , for models not admitting exact general solutions , achieving knowledge of the exact ground state , even if only for the restricted nontrivial set of parameters associated to factorization , would allow ( i ) to prove the existence of an ordered phase and characterize it ; ( ii ) to build variational or perturbative approximation schemes around the exact factorized solution , that may then be used as test benchmarks for the validity and the precision of numerical algorithms and simulations .",
    "unfortunately , the direct method based on the ansatz of a factorized solution is neither sufficiently general nor mathematically tractable , apart from the notable exceptions of one - dimensional spin chains with short - range @xcite , infinite - range @xcite , and some types of long - range exchange interactions @xcite .    in a recent work",
    "@xcite we introduced an analytic method that allows to determine exactly the existence of factorized ground states and to characterize their properties in quantum spin models defined on regular lattices of any size ( finite as well as at the thermodynamic limit ) , in any spatial dimension , and with spin - spin interactions of arbitrary range . in correspondence to rigorously established ground state factorizability , the method also allows to determine novel sets of exact solutions in generally non exactly solvable models .",
    "all the previous particular findings can be rigorously re - derived and extended within a unified framework inspired by concepts of quantum information science .    in the present work",
    "we extend the original method introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and we develop a general self - contained theory of ground state factorization in ( frustration - free ) quantum spin systems : with no _ a priori _ assumption on the nature of the magnetic ordering , we derive a complete and closed set of conditions that have to be satisfied by the hamiltonian interaction parameters in order for the ground state to be factorized , at precisely determined values of the external magnetic field , with well defined values of the magnetization and of the energy .",
    "besides the completely rigorous re - derivation of the few previously known results on quantum factorization points @xcite , our general analytic method allows to determine novel , exact factorization points and factorized ground states in , generally non exactly solvable , spin-@xmath0 models as well as in the corresponding hamiltonian models of any higher spin .",
    "these results hold true regardless of spatial dimensionality and interaction range , and can be easily extended even to non - translationally invariant systems .",
    "we illustrate the versatility of the method with a series of different applications , including models with nearest - neighbor interactions ( for which we provide the full factorization diagram , generalizing the results of refs .",
    "@xcite and of our recent work @xcite ) , models with long - range interactions ( notably including , among others , the fully connected infinite - range lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model @xcite and systems with unbalanced next - to - nearest - neighbor interactions on cubic lattices ) , and models with spatial anisotropies .",

    "quantum fluctuations in the ground states of cooperative many - body systems are typically highly correlated , that is , those states contain in the most general instance a strong degree of entanglement distributed among the individual components .",
    "this is one of the reasons why their exact characterization is often hard to be accomplished by analytical or even numerical methods .",
    "however , there may exist particular solutions corresponding to special values of the hamiltonian parameters such that the ground state becomes `` classical - like '' , in the sense of being a full product state of single - site factors ( completely separable , fully factorized state ) .",
    "it is quite surprising that despite the inherent appeal of such exact , special solutions , and the renewed interest stemming from possible applications to quantum technology , very few analytical advances were obtained in the last quarter of a century .      the first systematic work on ground state factorization in quantum spin models was completed by kurmann , thomas , and mller in 1982 @xcite .",
    "they focused on the one - dimensional nearest - neighbor anisotropic heisenberg - like antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath0 model in transverse field , with the assumption that all the spin - spin couplings take nonnegative values .",
    "et al . _ identified a precise value of the external magnetic field , the `` factorizing field '' , corresponding to which the system admits a fully factorized ground state .",
    "they employed a very direct , ",
    "brute force \" method , i.e. formulating a product state ansatz and verifying if and for what values of the hamiltonian parameters it satisfies the stationary schrdinger problem with lowest energy . even though this approach appears obvious and extremely easy to pursue , the positive result obtained by kurmann _",
    "_ in the case of the 1-d heisenberg model was enabled by some special properties of the case they analyzed .",
    "in fact , in order to verify the eigenvalue equation for the product state ansatz , one needs to decompose the total hamiltonian of the system into a series of pairwise terms , which could be done easily for the model studied by kurmann _",
    "_ since all the `` pairwise components '' of the factorizing magnetic field had the same weight in this particular case . however , this direct method of determining factorization is in fact significantly less obvious , useful , and comprehensive , when one tries to apply it to more general cases .",
    "for instance , considering models with interaction terms of growing spatial range , and/or increasing the spatial dimensionality of the lattice , and/or treating extensions to spatially anisotropic or non - translationally invariant models , results in increasingly hard `` guesses '' concerning the partitioning of the external field into pairwise components and in increasingly nontrivial verification steps . depending on the structure of the model and on the form of the product state ansatz , the direct method may either fail to detect factorization points at all , or it may detect only a subset of all physically realizable factorized solutions , or finally it may lead to intractable sets of conditions . these limitations of the direct method become evident , as we will see in the following , even in the simplest 1-d @xmath1 model with nearest - neighbor interactions analyzed by kurmann and coworkers . in their original work , due to the insufficient generality of their proposed product ansatz",
    ", they failed to identify a wide range of situations that allow the existence of factorized ground states . as we will see when",
    "discussing models with competing interactions of different spatial ranges , a further serious fault of the direct method , that becomes incurable in the presence of frustration , is its incorrect assessment of factorized ground states that are in fact excited energy eigenstates of the system .    following the seminal analysis by kurmann _",
    "_ , the direct method has been applied to the fully connected infinite - range lipkin - meshkov - glick model by dusuel and vidal @xcite , and to the anisotropic heisenberg chain with the same interactions of arbitrary range along the three spatial directions by hoeger et al .",
    "@xcite and by rossignoli _",
    "we would like to remark that these works , that include the results of refs .",
    "@xcite as special cases , provide an interesting characterization of factorization points in finite ( one - dimensional ) translationally invariant lattice spin models with periodic boundary conditions as those points where the parity symmetry is broken .      a general and rigorous approach to the problem of ground state separability , completely different from the direct method based on the product state ansatz , has been introduced by us in ref .",
    "@xcite and is fully developed in the present work . this analytic method allows _",
    "inter alia _ to complete the factorization diagram of the anisotropic spin-@xmath0 models without restrictions on the sign of the couplings , and to go significantly beyond the limitations of the previously mentioned studies .",
    "our approach is based on an additional characterization of product states ( including product ground states ) that employs concepts and tools of quantum information and entanglement theory .",
    "the strong point of the quantum informatic approach to ground state factorization lies in its generality and its ensuing independence from the types and ranges of interactions present in the hamiltonian , the lattice size , and the spatial dimension , which makes it applicable in the most general cases and therefore especially useful in all the situations that are either intractable or incomplete if one resorts to the direct method or to numerical techniques .",
    "in fact , in the original formulation of the quantum informatic method @xcite there was still trace of a residual `` ansatz '' in the initial stage , since the magnetic ordering of the candidate factorized ground state had to be in some sense guessed , and imposed _",
    "a priori_. moreover , in the final stage , we were not yet able to derive a completely general set of conditions in order to determine in each situation whether a candidate factorized state that turned out to belong to the spectrum of the hamiltonian was actually a ground state or belonged to the set of excited states .",
    "this had then to be decided case by case in each specific instance .    in the present work",
    "we proceed further and develop the complete method to determine and characterize factorized ground states in quantum cooperative systems .",
    "we provide the systematics that allows to determine the occurrence of full ground state separability given a generic quantum spin hamiltonian .",
    "the magnetic ordering is derived as a consequence of the theory and not imposed _ a priori_. a complete set of general conditions is established for the verification of ground state factorization , and the elegance of the method does not hinder practical usefulness in the application to specific models and situations .    we would like to recall that numerical advances on the problem of ground state factorization have been realized by the monte carlo study of ground state factorization in two - dimensional anisotropic nearest - neighbor spin models @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , beyond this important result the numerical approach appears to have a very restricted potential for extensions , since the required computational power increases rapidly with the spatial dimension and/or with the range of interactions .",
    "we will show that the difficulties inherent to the direct analytic approach and to the numerical method are intrinsically absent in our formalism .",
    "in the present section we provide a brief overview of some recent results on the geometrical interpretation of the entanglement measure known as `` tangle '' ( linear entropy ) @xcite and the consequences it entails for the relationship between energy and pairwise entanglement @xcite .",
    "such results embody the premises for our all - analytic characterization of ground state separability in quantum spin systems .    here and in the following we consider generic systems made of @xmath2 spin-@xmath0 elementary constituents , or , in the language of quantum information , @xmath2 qubits .",
    "for such a system , we introduce the set of single - qubit unitary operations ( _ squos _ ) @xmath3 @xcite , defined as the unitary transformations that act separately as the identity on any spin of the system except the @xmath4-th one , on which they act instead as hermitian , unitary , and traceless operators : @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ e.uk ] ) @xmath6 stands for the identity operator on the @xmath7-th spin of the system while the generic hermitian , unitary , and traceless operator @xmath8 can be expressed as a linear combination of the standard spin operators ( @xmath9 ) defined on the @xmath4-th spin : @xmath10 in the previous definition the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 take values respectively in the ranges @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 .",
    "physically , @xmath15 corresponds to a rotation in the spin space , and the traceless condition imposes the rotation operation to be orthogonal to the identity , so basically a combination of spin flip and phase flip .",
    "a squo transforms every pure state @xmath16 into a new state @xmath17 , that in general differs from @xmath18 .",
    "we may quantify the action of the squo in terms of the trace distance between the original and the transformed state , defined as @xmath19 .",
    "the distance @xmath20 varies in the interval @xmath21 $ ] and vanishes if and only if the two states coincide , meaning that the considered squo leaves the original state unchanged . for a given initial state and for any site @xmath4",
    ", one can determine the _ extremal - squo _",
    "( e - squo ) that minimizes such a distance .",
    "one can prove that the e - squo is uniquely determined by the following conditions on the angular variables @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the expectation value of the spin operator @xmath24 on the unperturbed state @xmath18 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the e - squo plays a crucial role in our analysis : for any pure state defined on a general system of interacting qubits one can prove @xcite that the square of the distance associated to the action of the e - squo coincides with the linear entropy @xmath26 $ ] of the @xmath4-th qubit ( where @xmath27 denotes the reduced density matrix of qubit @xmath4 ) .",
    "this quantity , also known as the _ tangle _ @xmath28 in the literature , is an entanglement monotone for qubit systems and satisfies important monogamy constraints @xcite .",
    "being a monotonic function of the von neumann entropy of entanglement @xcite , it quantifies the bipartite block entanglement present in the state @xmath18 between spin @xmath4 and the remaining @xmath29 constituents , and is thus a proper measure of single - site entanglement @xcite .",
    "one has the following relation @xcite :    @xmath30 \\ ; .\\ ] ]    this geometric - operational characterization of the tangle allows to develop a quantum informatic approach to the problem of characterizing the correlation properties of the ground state in many - body quantum systems @xcite .",
    "let us consider a collection of spin-@xmath0 systems defined on a regular lattice , with hamiltonian @xmath31 , and let @xmath18 denote from now on the ground state of @xmath31 . if the system is in the ground state , the application of a squo on a generic spin of the lattice is necessarily associated to an energy transfer that one must provide to the system in order to realize the selected squo . in other words ,",
    "a squo perturbs the system , and this perturbation results in an increase of the average energy ( obviously , in general the transformed state needs not to be an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "such energy deviation from the ground - state value can be quantitatively defined as @xmath32 because @xmath18 is the ground state of @xmath31 , @xmath33 is a non negative defined quantity . considering the special relation between the e - squo and the tangle",
    "we may expect that the associated amount of energy difference @xmath34 , appropriately named ` entanglement excitation energy ' ( exe ) , will have as well a strong , direct connection with the tangle and in general with the single - site entanglement in the ground state .",
    "in fact , starting from the above definition of eq .",
    "( [ e.ees ] ) and taking into account the property of the e - squo of leaving unchanged a fully disentangled state , it has been established in full generality @xcite that if the system is invariant under spatial translation and the hamiltonian of the system does not commute with any possible squo , then the vanishing of the exe is a _ necessary and sufficient _ condition to admit a fully factorized ground state @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "hence , if the system that we want to analyze satisfies all the former hypotheses , the vanishing of the exe provides an additional condition , besides the vanishing of the tangle @xmath28 , that one needs to include in establishing a general analytic approach to the problem of ground state factorization .",
    "the general method that was first partially developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the determination of existence , location , and exact form of factorized ground states rests on the following two main observations :    the ground state @xmath18 of a spin-@xmath0 hamiltonian @xmath31 is factorized if and only if the single - site entanglement ( tangle ) @xmath28 vanishes for all spins @xmath4 in the lattice ;    provided that @xmath35\\neq 0 $ ] for every possible squo @xmath36 of the form eq .",
    "( [ e.uk ] ) , the ground state @xmath18 of a spin-@xmath0 hamiltonian @xmath31 is factorized if and only if the exe @xmath37 vanishes @xmath38 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the strategy to the determination and understanding of factorization for a given hamiltonian bore on the above two facts and on the requirement to assume as working point a phase endowed with some kind of magnetic order . by imposing the vanishing of the exe and of the tangle",
    ", we showed how to determine uniquely the form of the completely disentangled state compatible with the assumed magnetic order , candidate to be the ground state of the system at a particular value of the external magnetic field ( labeled as `` factorizing field '' ) .",
    "the final steps of the procedure concern the determination of exact analytic conditions for the candidate factorized state to be an eigenstate of the hamiltonian with lowest energy . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we derived a closed set of eigenstate conditions , but establishing whether a factorized eigenstate is actually a ground state had to be left to a case by case analysis .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize the method , extend its scope , and apply it to different classes of quantum spin models .",
    "firstly , we will show that there is no need for _ a priori _ assumptions on the magnetic order .",
    "in fact , we will prove that the existence of a factorized ground state is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of quantum phase transitions and ordered phases in translationally - invariant quantum spin models with exchange interactions and in the presence of external fields .",
    "moreover , the actual structure of the factorized ground state determines automatically the kind of ordered phase .",
    "further , we derive a complete set of rigorous conditions for the candidate disentangled state to be an eigenstate and a ground state . in particular , for systems with no frustration",
    "we prove that if the factorized state is an eigenstate , then it is always a ground state of the system .",
    "we illustrate the method in detail by considering its application to the general , translationally invariant , exchange hamiltonian @xmath31 for spin-@xmath0 systems on a @xmath20-dimensional regular lattices , with spin - spin interactions of arbitrary range and arbitrary anisotropic couplings : @xmath39 here @xmath40 ( and similarly @xmath41 ) is a @xmath20-dimensional index vector identifying a site in the lattice , @xmath42 @xmath43 stands for the spin-@xmath0 operator on site @xmath40 , @xmath44 is external field directed along the @xmath45 direction , @xmath46 is the distance between two lattice sites , and @xmath47 is the spin - spin coupling along the @xmath48 direction .",
    "translational invariance is ensured by the fact that all the couplings depend only on the distance @xmath49 between the spins .",
    "this type of hamiltonian encompasses a large variety of models and spans over several universality classes including , among others , the ising , xy , heisenberg , and xyz symmetry classes .",
    "besides their importance in quantum statistical mechanics and in the theory of quantum critical phenomena , these models play an important role in the study of various schemes of quantum information and quantum communication tasks with quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "it is a rather straightforward exercise to verify that the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ e.hamiltonian ] ) never commutes with the squos @xmath50 .",
    "translational invariance and non - commutativity of the hamiltonian with the squos guarantee that the vanishing of the exe is a necessary and sufficient condition for the full separability of the ground state [ statement ( ii ) above ] .",
    "since the external field @xmath44 is uniform on the lattice , it forces the existence of a site - independent , nonvanishing magnetization @xmath51 along the @xmath45 axis : @xmath52 . on the other hand , at a factorization point , statement ( i ) above imposes the vanishing of the single - site entanglement on all sites of the lattice .",
    "therefore , if a factorization point exists , the magnetizations along the directions orthogonal to the external field must assume the following form : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the modulus of the projection of the magnetization on the @xmath55 plane and the local orientations @xmath56 , and hence the type of magnetic ordering in the @xmath55 plane , remain undetermined .",
    "since @xmath51 is site - independent , then @xmath57 is site - independent as well .",
    "taking into account eq .",
    "( [ e.minimumpoint ] ) of sec .",
    "[ sec.squoexe ] one sees that , at least at the factorization point , @xmath58 , i.e. one of the two angles that fix the orientation of the e - squo , does not depend on the site index",
    ". therefore @xmath59 @xmath60 .    collecting the former results and considering that in the presence of a factorized ground state , if it exists , all the correlation functions are products of single - site expectations values",
    ", we obtain that the condition on the vanishing of the exe associated to the generic site @xmath61 reads :    @xmath62    in the former equation @xmath63 is the _ factorizing field _ , i.e. the value , if it exists , of the external field for which ground state factorization occurs .",
    "since we are looking for a fully factorized ground state , eq .",
    "( [ e.exe ] ) must be satisfied simultaneously for all @xmath61 and , henceforth , eq .  ( [ e.exe ] ) must be site - independent .",
    "this fact in turn implies that the following relation must be satisfied by every angle @xmath56 : @xmath64 eq .",
    "( [ e.exe ] ) must hold independently of the site on which the e - squo acts and the value of the constant @xmath65 must be identified by determining the expression of the energy density , i.e. the energy per site , associated to the factorized ground state .",
    "given the total ground - state energy @xmath66 and the total number of sites @xmath2 , the latter quantity can be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the coordination number , that is the number of sites at distance @xmath49 from a given site . in order to determine the magnetic order in the candidate factorized ground state",
    ", one can now exploit the fact that , by definition , it must minimize the energy of the system .",
    "therefore such state will be simply characterized by the magnetic order that minimizes the per - site contribution @xmath65 , depending on the hamiltonian parameters and the geometric structure of the lattice . thus the general conditions for full separability of the ground state lead to the uncovering of the magnetic order in the @xmath55 plane . in the original formulation of the quantum - informatic method @xcite one had to assume from the beginning the type of ordered phase , and this resulted in constraints on the magnetization and limitations in the range of the coupling coefficients .",
    "the outcome of the minimization of the energy density depends on the presence or the absence of frustration in the system , either due to the lattice geometry , or to the structure of the hamiltonian , or to both causes .",
    "for hamiltonians belonging to the class of eq .",
    "( [ e.hamiltonian ] ) , frustration can be due both to the geometry of the lattice , e.g. for systems with nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions defined on a lattice that admits closed loops with an odd number of spins , and to the competition of interactions of different spatial orders , e.g. in systems defined on linear chains with nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic and next - nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "frustration effects in systems with interactions of different spatial ranges arise whenever it happens that the minimization of the energy associated to interactions over a certain spatial scale precludes the possibility of minimizing the energy associated to interactions over a different spatial scale . in the absence of frustration , i.e. when the lattice geometry and the interactions between the spins are such to allow all energy minimizations simultaneously , it is straightforward to prove that every possible factorized ground state must be characterized by one of only four magnetic orders out of the many possible ones .",
    "the complete proof of this statement is reported in appendix [ appendixfourcases ] .",
    "this restricted set includes ferromagnetic ordering along the @xmath69 direction ( @xmath70 ) or along the @xmath71 direction ( @xmath72 ) , and antiferromagnetic ordering along the @xmath69 direction ( @xmath73 ) or along the @xmath71 direction ( @xmath74 ) , the type of order effectively present in the ground state can be determined by comparing the values of the different `` net interactions '' along the @xmath69 and @xmath71 directions , where the net interactions are defined as follows : @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the net interaction along the @xmath45 direction is defined equivalently as @xmath77 as a function of the net interactions , the magnetic orders in the system are determined by the values of @xmath78 : @xmath79 it is interesting to observe that , in terms of the net interactions , one can immediately establish the presence or absence of frustration in the system : any frustration arising from the presence of competing interactions would imply that @xmath80 , with @xmath76 depending on which of the two axes is characterized by a non vanishing value of the magnetization .",
    "we remark that here and in the following we are not considering the particular situation in which a _ saturation _ occurs rather than a true ground state factorization : this instance will be discussed separately in subsec .",

    "the remarkable aspect of factorization is then that it occurs , according to well defined conditions and constraints , at precisely defined , finite values of the couplings and of the fields in an ordered ( or symmetry - broken ) phase .",
    "this means that factorization occurs when the system is relatively strongly interacting and the external aligning field is relatively weak .",
    "moreover , we will see that the factorization point is always a precursor from below ( from the ordered phase ) of the quantum critical point , as first observed for the @xmath1 model with nearest - neighbor interactions @xcite .",
    "saturation is the phenomenon of ground state factorization that occurs trivially when the value of the external field grows unboundedly compared to all other hamiltonian parameters .",
    "therefore its aligning effect on the spins prevails against all other effects and quantum correlations are suppressed .",
    "the main physical difference between proper factorization and saturation is then clear and is reflected at the level of the hilbert space of states .",

    "we now move on to show that the factorized eigenstate , in the case of saturation , is the system s ground state in an infinite range of values of the external field . here",
