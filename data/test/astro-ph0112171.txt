    "the application of the gunn - peterson test to qsos absorption spectra suggests that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is completely reionized by @xmath1 .",
    "several authors claim that the known population of quasars and galaxies provides @xmath2 times fewer ionizing photons than are necessary to keep the observed igm ionization level ; thus , additional sources of ionizing photons are required at high redshift , the most promising being early galaxies and quasars .",
    "recent observational evidences suggest the existence of an early population of pregalactic stellar objects which could have contributed to the reionization and metal enrichment of the igm . in the following section",
    ", i will review the processes that regulate the formation and the evolution of such galaxies .",
    "once the gas has virialized into the potential well of preexisting dark matter haloes , additional cooling is required in order for the gas to further collapse and form stars .",
    "objects with virial temperatures @xmath3  k rely on hydrogen ly@xmath4 line cooling for their formation , while the main coolant for objects with @xmath5  k ( _ popiii objects _ ) is molecular hydrogen , a key species for galaxy formation in the early universe .",
    "h@xmath0 is a very fragile molecule , as it is easily dissociated by photons with energy in the range 11.26 - 13.6  ev .",
    "thus , the existence of an uv flux below the lyman limit , capable of dissociating h@xmath0 in collapsing structures can strongly influence the formation of popiii objects .",
    "ciardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have derived the minimum mass that a forming galaxy requires to be able to shield against an external incident dissociating flux : they found that the mass is in the range @xmath6 , depending on the intensity of the incident flux and the formation redshift .",
    "once an object has collapsed , the first episode of star formation can strongly influence the subsequent star formation process via the effects of mass and energy deposition due to massive stars .",
    "these processes may induce different phenomena , such as a heating and a loss of the interstellar gas , or a dissociation of h@xmath0 molecules in star forming regions . as a consequence , the star formation rate decreases , more or less dramatically depending on the mass of the object .",
    ".5truecm    ciardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have studied the interplay between the primordial galaxy formation process and the igm reionization . in their analysis",
    "the authors have included a self - consistent treatment of the feedback effects that regulate the formation and the evolution of galaxies , as explained in the previous section .",
    "one of the output of their model is the redshift evolution of the hii filling factor , @xmath7 ( fig .  1 ) . at @xmath8 the main contribution to",
    "@xmath7 comes from small mass objects ( @xmath9 ) , while at lower redshift , when the formation and evolution of such objects is suppressed by feedback effects , the main contribution comes from galaxies of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the contribution of small mass objects to the ionizing photon budget is negligible .",
    "these galaxies are nevertheless important as sinks of radiation on small scales .    to improve on the mentioned study ,",
    "the assumption of constant igm density should be released and a realistic density distribution adopted . in this case , the main complication would be to properly follow the propagation of ionizing photons into the igm .",
    "to this aim , ciardi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have developed the code crash , a monte carlo approach to the radiative transfer of ionizing photons produced by a source with known emission properties through a given density field .    using crash",
    ", we simulate the reionization process in a box of 30  mpc comoving ( sthr et al . ; ciardi , sthr & white in prep . ) .",
    "this choice of the box dimension allows us to study a region large enough to be representative of the universe and at the same time to resolve objects with masses @xmath11 , the ones responsible for the main ionizing photon production ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the box is obtained from a combination of a high - resolution @xmath12cdm n - body simulation ( yoshida , sheth & diaferio 2001 ) and a semi - analitycal model of galaxy formation ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ) . in fig .",
    "2 the ionized regions produced by the simulation are shown , at @xmath13 ( left panel ) and @xmath14 ( right panel ) , when the volume averaged ionization fraction is 0.1% and 4% respectively .",
    "the reionization process critically depends on the choice of the source emission properties . here",
    ", we have adopted a larson imf and a spectrum typical of popiii stars ; these assumptions give an upper limit to the ionizing photon production .",
    "more critical is the choice of the escape fraction of ionizing photons , @xmath15 , for which we have adopted the indicative value of 20% . as @xmath15 is a highly uncertain parameter , ciardi ,",
    "bianchi & ferrara ( 2001 ) have tried to constrain it for a milky way type galaxy via 3d numerical simulations , using the code crash to follow the photon propagation .",
    "they have compared results for a smooth gaussian density distribution and an inhomogeneous , fractal one , with realistic assumptions for the ionizing stellar sources based on available data in the solar neighborhood . in fig .  3 ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath15 as a function of the total ionization rate , @xmath16 , is shown in the case of a gaussian ( filled triangles ) and a fractal ( open circles ) density distribution .",
    "values in the range @xmath17 are found depending on @xmath16 and the density field , confirming the high uncertainty of @xmath15 .    .5truecm",
    "to properly describe the igm reionization process , the following ingredients are needed : i ) a reliable model for structure formation , including a self - consistent treatment of feedback effects and the best possible balance between large volume and high resolution of the simulation ; ii ) an accurate treatment of the radiative transfer of ionizing photons ; iii ) a better constraint on the parameters involved in the calculation , such as the source emission properties and the escape fraction .",
