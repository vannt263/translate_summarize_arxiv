    "the past decade has been marked by the advent of an avant garde school of thought which has tried to address a number of important problems and observations in standard general relativity and cosmology , namely the hierarchy problem ; the great disparity between the fundamental forces of nature , the observation that the universe is undergoing and accelerated expansion relating to dark energy and the problem of galaxy rotation curves relating to dark matter .",
    "this school of thought is based on the assumption that our 4-dimensional observable universe , the brane , is embedded in a higher dimensional space , the bulk , which has the geometry of an ads space and to which gravitons can scape but ordinary matter can not .",
    "the ads nature of the bulk space would cause gravity to become localized around the brane and would modify the gravitational potential at short distances .",
    "such a scenario @xcite , proposed by randall and sundrum ( rs ) , has been able to account for the hierarchy of the fundamental forces with great success and has been generating a myriad of other scenarios and variations . shortly after , in a seminal work @xcite ,",
    "it was shown how to project the einstein field equations , assumed to hold in the bulk , onto the brane .",
    "an unprecedented number of works utilizing this idea have been appearing ever since @xcite .    in an effort to relax the restriction of an ads bulk and hence allowing gravity to penetrate large distances , dvali , gabadadze and poratti ( dgp ) @xcite proposed an alternative model in which the influence of gravity on the brane is accounted for by including an induced 4-dimensional einstein - hilbert term to the full action . in this model , in contrast to the standard rs model , gravity is modified at large distances . for",
    "a comprehensive review of this model see @xcite .",
    "the cosmological implications of this model was investigated in @xcite where it was shown that the friedmann equation on the brane has two branches , both reducing to the usual frw equation at the small hubble radius limit .",
    "however , the important discovery was that one of these branches predict a self - accelerating universe at late times , consistent with the observation that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expanding phase .",
    "so much for the success of the dgp model , a word of caution is in order ; the theory predicts the existence of ghost - like excitations .",
    "many scenarios have been undertaken to explain away such ghosts , but as yet no satisfactory solution exists .",
    "the interested reader should consult @xcite for further insight . in this paper",
    "we do not discuss such excitations since our aim lies in studying the virial mass discrepancy in dgp models .",
    "one of the interesting problems in cosmology is the calculation of the mass of cluster of galaxies . in recent years",
    ", our ability in performing precision measurements in observational cosmology is developed to such an extent that we can obtain accurate values for the mass of individual galaxies and their velocities .",
    "we may therefore find the total mass of cluster of galaxies in two ways , adding up the masses of individual galaxies , or do it statistically and use the virial theorem .",
    "since these methods represent two aspects of the same thing we must obtain the same result .",
    "however , almost in all clusters the virial mass is 20 - 30 time greater than @xmath3 , the mass obtained by adding up the individual masses . also by newton second law",
    "we know that the mass of a galaxy is proportional to @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the tangential velocity of a test particle located at the distance @xmath1 from the center of the galaxy .",
    "as observations have shown , the tangential velocity of a test particle remains nearly constant at large distances from the center of the galaxy .",
    "this is , of course , in contradiction to what newtonian gravity predicts .",
    "one way around this is to postulate the existence of dark matter .",
    "however , there are geometrical approaches to address this problem , namely to use modified einstein field equations , as is done in brane - world models @xcite or in modified gravity @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use the dgp model discussed above to explain the the virial mass discrepancy in a geometric manner .",
    "as we shall see later , the linearly increasing behavior of the virial mass with distance can be explained by taking into account the extra terms that appear in the field equations which in turn originate from the bulk geometry . in order to do this",
    "we must have a procedure to obtain the total mass of the cluster .",
    "we use jean s equation and the observational data to obtain the total mass distribution of clusters .",
    "we also obtain the radial velocity dispersion in this model which suggests an alternative way to obtain the virial mass of clusters and can be used to explain the observational data .",
    "the question of the flat rotation curves of individual galaxies requires a separate undertaking and will be dealt with in a future work .",
    "let us start with the standard dgp action @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the metric , ricci scalar and matter action of the bulk and @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are those of the brane with @xmath13 being the brane cosmological constant , and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the bulk ( brane ) planck scale .",
    "the third term is the hawking - gibbons boundary term @xcite and @xmath16 is the extrinsic curvature .",
    "after varying the action and denoting the extra dimension by @xmath17 , we obtain the einstein field equations in the bulk @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the bulk ( brane ) energy momentum tensor for which a perfect fluid form is assumed @xmath21 and for the bulk metric we take @xmath22 the induced metric on the brane is simply @xmath23 where @xmath24 etc . assuming that the brane is at @xmath25 and noting that @xcite @xmath26,\\label{note1 } \\\\    & \\frac{d^2 f}{d y^2}=\\ddot{f}+2\\dot{f}\\delta(y),\\label{note2}\\\\    & \\left(\\frac{d f}{d y}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d h}{d y}\\right)=\\dot{f}\\dot{h},\\label{note3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 are arbitrary functions of @xmath30 , we obtain the following field equations in the bulk @xmath31\\nonumber \\\\    & - \\frac{m_3 ^ 2}{r^2}e^{-\\mu_0}\\bigg[r\\mu_0^{\\prime}+e^{\\mu_0}-1\\bigg]\\delta(y)=    -(\\rho_b+m^2_3\\lambda)\\delta(y)-\\rho_{_b }    \\label{e_eq_bu_1 } , \\\\    & \\frac{m_4 ^ 3}{4r^2}\\bigg[\\left(4 + 4r\\nu^{\\prime}+4r\\lambda^{\\prime}+\\nu^{\\prime}\\lambda^{\\prime}r^2\\right)e^{-\\mu }    + \\left(2\\ddot{\\nu}r^2 + 4\\dot{\\nu}r^2\\delta(y)+\\dot{\\nu}^2 r^2    -\\dot{\\nu}\\dot{\\lambda } r^2\\right)e^{-\\lambda}-4\\bigg]\\nonumber \\\\    & + \\frac{m_3 ^ 2}{r^2}e^{-\\mu_0}\\bigg[r\\nu_0^{\\prime}-e^{\\mu_0}+1\\bigg]\\delta(y)= (    p_b - m^2_3\\lambda)\\delta(y)+p_{_b } ,    \\label{e_eq_bu_2 } \\\\    & \\frac{m_4 ^ 3}{4r}\\bigg[\\left(2\\nu^{\\prime}-2\\mu^{\\prime}+2\\lambda^{\\prime}+2\\nu^{{\\prime}{\\prime}}r+\\nu^{{\\prime}2}r+2\\lambda^{{\\prime}{\\prime}}r    + \\lambda^{{\\prime}2}r-\\mu^{\\prime}\\nu^{\\prime}r+\\nu^{\\prime}\\lambda^{\\prime}r-\\mu^{\\prime}\\lambda^{\\prime}r\\right)e^{-\\mu}\\nonumber\\\\    & + \\left(2\\ddot{\\nu}r+4\\dot{\\nu}r\\delta(y)+\\dot{\\nu}^2 r    + 2\\ddot{\\mu}r+4\\dot{\\mu}r\\delta(y)+\\dot{\\mu}^2 r    + \\dot{\\nu}\\dot{\\mu } r-\\dot{\\nu}\\dot{\\lambda } r-\\dot{\\mu}\\dot{\\lambda } r\\right)e^{-\\lambda}\\bigg]\\nonumber \\\\    & + \\frac{m_3 ^ 2}{4r}e^{-\\mu_0}\\bigg[2\\nu^{\\prime}_0 - 2\\mu^{\\prime}_0-\\nu^{\\prime}_0 \\mu^{\\prime}_0 r+2\\nu^{{\\prime}{\\prime}}_0r+\\nu^{{\\prime}2}r    \\bigg]\\delta(y)=(p_b - m^2_3\\lambda)\\delta(y)+p_{_b } , \\label{e_eq_bu_3}\\\\    & \\frac{m_4 ^ 3}{4r^2}\\bigg[\\left(4 - 4r\\mu^{\\prime}+4r\\nu^{\\prime}\\mu^{\\prime}r^2+\\nu^{{\\prime}2}r^2 + 2\\nu^{{\\prime}{\\prime}}r^2\\right)e^{-\\mu }    + \\dot{\\nu}\\dot{\\mu}r^2 e^{-\\lambda}-4\\bigg]=p_5 , \\label{e_eq_bu_4}\\\\    & \\frac{m_4 ^ 3}{4r}\\bigg(2\\dot{\\nu}^{\\prime}r+\\nu^{\\prime}\\dot{\\nu } r -\\dot{\\mu}\\nu^{\\prime}r-\\lambda^{\\prime}\\dot{\\nu } r    -4\\dot{\\mu}\\bigg)\\big(2\\theta(y)-1\\big)=0\\label{e_eq_bu_5}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a prime represents derivative with respect to @xmath1 . since only @xmath32 can contribute to the brane equations we obtain the einstein field equations on the brane @xmath33-m^2_3\\lambda , \\label{e_eq_b_3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the induced energy density @xmath34 and pressure @xmath35 as @xmath36",

    ", this would constitute the usual virial theorem with a cosmological constant , first derived by jackson @xcite using the boltzmann equation ( [ bolt_eq_1 ] ) into which the metric of the space - time is substituted . in order to obtain a relation between the virial mass and the extra term @xmath76 which has its origins in the bulk , we define the following radii @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the virial radius and @xmath8 is the radius defined by the extra term @xmath0 . by defining the virial mass as @xmath79 and using the relations @xmath80 the generalized virial theorem ( [ virial_th ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath81 the contribution of @xmath13 to the mass of the galaxy is several order of magnitude smaller than the observed mass .",
    "also @xmath82 is much larger than @xmath3 for most galaxies .",
    "therefore , we can neglect the unity and the term involving the cosmological constant in equation ( [ virial_eq_1 ] ) .",
    "the virial mass in our model is then given by @xmath83 as can be seen , the virial mass is proportional to an extra term stemming from the global bulk effects .",
    "in order to estimate @xmath76 we must solve the einstein equations for @xmath35 and @xmath34 and obtain @xmath76 from ( [ n_mass ] ) .",
    "however there is a simpler way of doing this which we will follow .",
    "first , consider the conservation of the right - hand side of einstein equations ( [ e_eq_b_1])-([e_eq_b_3 ] ) @xmath84 this means that we only need to calculate @xmath35 .",
    "in most clusters the majority of the baryonic mass is in the form of intra - cluster gas . taking this assumption into consideration and using equations ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ n_mass ] )",
    ", we obtain an expression for the total mass of the cluster @xmath85 another expression can be obtained from jean s equation @xmath86+\\rho_g(r)\\frac{d\\phi}{dr}=0,\\label{jean_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the gravitational potential .",
    "we also assume that the gas is isotropically distributed inside the cluster so that the mass - weighted velocity dispersion in the radial and tangential directions are equal ; @xmath88 . assuming that the gravitational field is weak so that @xmath87 satisfies the poisson equation @xmath89 , the jean s equation is reduced to @xmath90 where we have used the relation @xmath91 .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite , the gas density @xmath92 can be fitted to the observational data by the following radial distribution @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the core radius and @xmath95 and @xmath96 are cluster independent constants . for most clusters",
    "@xmath97 @xcite and therefore , in the limit @xmath98 considered here , the gas density distribution can be written as @xmath99 moreover , we choose the following equation of state for the intra - cluster gas @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the mean atomic weight of the particles in the cluster gas and @xmath102 is the mass of proton . with these assumptions , equation ( [ jeans_2 ] ) reduces to @xmath103 the contribution of the gas density to the total mass of the cluster is very small at the boundary of the cluster , i.e. where @xmath104 , as can be seen from equations ( [ density_dist_2 ] ) and ( [ total_mass_1 ] ) .",
    "we may now calculate @xmath35 from equations ( [ total_mass_1 ] ) and ( [ jeans_3 ] ) , taking the approximation above @xmath105 and using equation ( [ n_mass ] ) to obtain @xmath106 this equation is obviously an approximation since the contribution of the baryonic mass is neglected .",
    "however this is no cause for concern since the value of the baryonic mass of the clusters is about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than its total mass . as can be seen , @xmath107 and",
    "since the virial mass is proportional to @xmath0 and the latter is proportional to @xmath1 , this could offer a possible resolution to the virial mass discrepancy in the context of dgp brane worlds .    to estimate the value of @xmath0",
    ", we first note that @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the gravitational constant @xcite .",
    "a typical value of the temperature of a cluster gas is @xmath110 @xcite . the virial radius of the cluster of galaxies is usually assumed to be @xmath111 , indicating the radius for which the mass density of the cluster is about @xmath112 , where @xmath113 . the virial mass of the cluster is then estimated as @xmath114 .",
    "we can therefore define the maximum extension of the @xmath76 mass to be the radius at which @xmath115 . from equation ( [ p_equation ] ) we have @xmath116 finally , we can estimate @xmath76 from ( [ n_equation ] ) @xmath117 this is in agreement with observational values for the virial mass of clusters @xcite .",
    ". for this cluster @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and",
    "we have set @xmath121 and @xmath122 for the top , middle and bottom curves respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    another important observational quantity is the radial velocity dispersion which plays an important role in estimating the virial mass of the clusters .",
    "as is well known , the simple form @xmath123 can be used to fit the observational data @xcite .",
    "the dgp model can provide an expression for the radial velocity dispersion which we will derive in this section .    adopting the approximations used after equation ( [ bolt_eq_6 ] ) ,",
    "we may write equation ( [ bolt_eq_3 ] ) as @xmath124 where we have assumed that the velocity distribution in the cluster is isotropic , so that @xmath125 . moreover , from the einstein field equations we have @xmath126 integrating , we obtain @xmath127 where @xmath128 is some constant . the differential form of the radial velocity dispersion can be obtained from equations ( [ sigma_1 ] ) and ( [ sigma_3 ] ) @xmath129 now , using expressions ( [ density_dist_2 ] ) and ( [ n_equation ] ) for @xmath130 and @xmath76 and by virtue of equation ( [ mass ] ) we obtain @xmath131 for @xmath132 we have @xmath133 our expression for @xmath134 can therefore be used to fit the observational data . in figure [ rvd ]",
    "we have plotted the radial velocity dispersion for the cluster ngc5813 .",
    "this cluster has @xmath135 and @xmath120 @xcite , and the radial velocity dispersion is about @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "we see that the radial velocity dispersion ( [ sigma_5 ] ) is compatible with the observed profiles @xcite .",
    "since an expression for the radial velocity dispersion can be obtained by other theoretical methods which explain cluster discrepancies , such a relation can be used to differentiate them @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have considered the virial mass in the frame work of dgp brane worlds .",
    "the resulting field equations on the brane have an additional term which is due to the geometry of the extra dimension and can be associated with a geometrical mass .",
    "the virial theorem was obtained by the use of boltzmann equation , assuming that galaxies in the cluster are point - like , non - interacting particles .",
    "we showed that the resulting virial theorem has an additional potential term due to the extra dimension .",
    "the virial theorem has also been exploited in other brane - world models @xcite to explain the virial mass discrepancy .",
    "the advantage of the dgp model however is in the explanation of the self accelerating phase of the universe without resorting to dark energy in a consistent manner .",
    "we obtained the virial mass of clusters from the virial theorem and showed that it is proportional to the geometrical mass of the model .",
    "the behavior of the virial mass was investigated in section 4 and showed to be a linear function of the distance . to estimate the geometrical mass @xmath0 we needed another relation in addition to the einstein field equations to close the system of equations .",
    "such a relation was obtained by using the jean s equation for clusters , assuming that clusters have spherical symmetry and are in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the solution presented in this work offers a possible explanation to the question of the virial mass discrepancy .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion profile of clusters was also obtained , having two arbitrary constants , one with a coefficient decreasing with @xmath1 and the other increasing with @xmath1 .",
    "this allowed us to use this expression for any cluster with @xmath137 .",
    "we used the observed radial velocity dispersion for the cluster ngc5813 as an example to show that our model can account for the velocity dispersion of clusters .",
    "in addition to explaining the observational data , the velocity dispersion profile can be used to study the various aspects of models predicting the virial mass .",
