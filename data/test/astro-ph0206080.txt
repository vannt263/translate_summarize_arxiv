    "there is compelling evidence that high - energy processes and high - energy particles play a pivotal role in the energy release , energy transport , and plasma heating during solar flares ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "a standard scenario proposes that electrons ( perhaps also ions ) are accelerated in the corona in the course of magnetic reconnection . as the electrons travel along closed magnetic fields ,",
    "those with large pitch angles and sufficient energy ( typically several 100  kev ) lose a small part of their energy as gyrosynchrotron radio emission .",
    "the bulk kinetic energy of the accelerated electrons , however , is carried to the chromosphere where it is deposited by electron - ion collisions .",
    "the collision of the beam with the dense plasma reveals itself by non - thermal hard x - ray radiation ( hxr , typically between 10@xmath1100  kev ) that , however , constitutes only a small fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the total energy loss .",
    "the bulk energy is transformed into heat , producing an overpressure in the chromosphere as the gas can not radiate away the energy influx sufficiently rapidly . as a consequence , the gas evaporates explosively into the corona as a @xmath3  k plasma visible in x - rays during the gradual phase of a solar flare @xcite .",
    "the observed gyrosynchrotron radio luminosity @xmath4 and the hard x - ray luminosity @xmath5 are , to first order , proportional to the instantaneous number of fast electrons and therefore to the power @xmath6 injected into the system , while the slowly variable soft x - ray luminosity @xmath7 is roughly proportional to the accumulated total energy @xmath8 in the hot coronal flare plasma .",
    "one therefore expects that @xmath9 a relation that is commonly known as the ` neupert effect ' @xcite .",
    "although significant deviations from this scenario have been observed in solar flares ( e.g. , heating starting before any hard x - rays can be detected , or absence of one of the emission types discussed above ) , there is strong support for several features of this model in the majority of solar flares @xcite . for example , the coincidence to within a fraction of a second of hxr brightenings at a pair of magnetic loop footpoints that are separated by @xmath10  cm requires non - thermal particle velocities @xcite .",
    "it is thought that the same mechanisms should operate in stellar flares , although flares on some classes of stars deviate considerably from the proposed solar analogy . in particular , giant flares on rs cvn - type binaries may require mechanisms unknown on the sun .",
    "rs cvn binaries , commonly consisting of a giant or subgiant primary with a main - sequence or subgiant companion in a close orbit , are sources of luminous radio and x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "very long flare time scales and radio source sizes of order of the intrabinary distance have been modeled in terms of giant dipole - like magnetospheric structures @xcite into which high - energy particles are injected from a flare site @xcite , and where they lose most of their energy by radiation . coordinated observations in x - rays and radio are required to study the importance of high - energy electrons in the heating mechanism .",
    "@xcite reported a neupert effect - like behavior during a large flare on the dme star ad leo , where optical ( u band ) and euv emissions were used as proxies for the radiation from high - energy electrons ( radio , hxr ) and from the thermal plasma , respectively .",
    "@xcite discussed the first stellar neupert effect seen in the radio and x - ray bands on the dm5.5e binary uv cet , finding similar timing and similar energy budgets as in solar gradual ( `` type c '' ) events .",
    "@xmath0 gem is a close binary of the rs cvn type , consisting of a k1  iii giant and a fainter companion whose spectral classification is unclear @xcite .",
    "its distance is @xmath11  pc @xcite .",
    "it is a luminous radio ( log@xmath12 , in erg  s@xmath13  hz@xmath13 ; @xcite ) and x - ray source ( log@xmath14 , in erg  s@xmath13 , @xcite and references therein , all luminosities corrected to the hipparcos distance ) , and was monitored previously during flares or during quiescence at radio , euv , and x - ray wavelengths @xcite .",
    "it is generally assumed that the coronal emission is largely related to the k1  iii star .",
    "we observed @xmath0 gem with _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite between 2001 april 6 , 16:46  ut @xmath1 april 7 , 07:53  ut , using all five x - ray detectors on board .",
    "since here we are predominantly interested in the time behavior , we will present exclusively the sensitive european photon imaging camera ( epic ) pn light curve for the energy range [ 0.15 , 10 ]  kev @xcite .",
    "the pn camera was operated in the small window mode given the expected brightness of the target ( both at optical and at x - ray wavelengths ) .",
    "background subtraction is irrelevant for the very high source count rate .",
    "the features in the light curve were confirmed from the other detectors .",
    "the data were processed using the standard sas software ( version of 2001 may ) .",
    "dead - time corrections were applied ( 29% of the counts are lost in the utilized mode ) . for most of the observing time ( april 6 , 20:12  ut @xmath1 april 7 , 07:58  ut ) , the very large array ( vla ) monitored the 6  cm flux ( frequency @xmath15  hz ) of @xmath0 gem in both left- and right - hand polarizations over a bandwidth of 100  mhz .",
    "the calibration of the radio data followed standard procedures within the aips software .",
    "individual maps were made for each observing scan ( @xmath1612.5@xmath17 ) ; the fluxes were read from these maps using the jmfit task .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observed @xmath0 gem in the course of a large x - ray flare , with a pn peak count rate of @xmath18100  cts  s@xmath13 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath19  erg  s@xmath13 or @xmath165 times the usual quiescent x - ray emission level ( as cited above ) .",
    "figure  [ lightcurves]a ( top panel ) presents the pn light curve , binned to 500  s. only the peak of this flare was observed . from the pn spectrum",
    ", the x - ray emission can be interpreted as being due to hot ( several kev ) , thermal plasma .",
    "the simultaneous radio emission ( bottom panel in figure  [ lightcurves ] ) is strongly varying around a few mjy ( @xmath20  erg  @xmath21s@xmath13  hz@xmath13 ) , typically on time scales of less than 5000  s. we will concentrate our discussion on the second flare that is fully visible at radio wavelengths , i.e. , the episode between 1.03@xmath11.32  d.    motivated by equation  [ neupert ] , we smoothed the x - ray light curve , either using a boxcar of width 11 bins ( equivalent to 5500  s , not shown ) , or a chebychev - polynomial fit of order 9 ( figure  [ lightcurves]a ) .",
    "we then calculated the time derivative of each smoothed light curve .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure  [ lightcurves]b ( solid : for chebychev fit ; dotted : for boxcar - smoothed fit ) , and are to be compared with the radio light curve in panel c. the curves are very similar , signifying a relation close to that described by equation  [ neupert ] , i.e. , a neupert effect . to quantify the relative timing of the two curves",
    ", we computed the cross correlation function as follows : @xmath22         \\left[\\displaystyle{\\sum_{k=1}^m}(d_k-\\bar{d})^2\\right]\\right)^{1/2}}\\ ] ] for a time lag @xmath23 in units of bins , where we used @xmath24 time bins of 500  s each as shown in figure  [ lightcurves]b , for the time interval marked by a horizontal bar in figure  [ lightcurves]c . for @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "are interchanged . here , @xmath28 is the radio flux and @xmath29 is the x - ray time derivative at the grid point @xmath30 ( the boxcar - smoothed version was used ; the result using the chebychev - smoothed version is in full agreement ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the means of the respective variables .",
    "the first factor on the right - hand side of equation  [ cross ] corrects for the decreasing number of terms in the denominator of the second factor . to obtain identical time bins for both curves , we linearly interpolated the radio data to the grid defined by the x - ray bins ; this is sufficiently accurate given the short time bins compared to the intrinsic light curve variability time scales .",
    "the inset in figure  [ lightcurves]c shows @xmath33 .",
    "the function sharply peaks at zero lag , indicating no significant lag between the two curves .",
    "note that the units of the x - ray time derivative and the radio flux are not important for equation  [ neupert ] and the figures have been scaled arbitrarily . also , the x - ray time derivative is mostly negative since the variability occurs during the gradual decline from the main peak .",
    "again , this is of little importance as such a trend can be subtracted from the data , shifting the derivative to larger values .",
    "figure  [ lightcurves ] shows compelling evidence for the presence of a neupert effect , i.e. , a radio light curve that is approximately proportional to the time derivative of the x - ray light curve .",
    "the light curves alone do not prove the operation of chromospheric evaporation induced by electron beams .",
    "it is possible that the rate of electron injection is proportional to the rate of heating , both being induced by the same mechanism , while the two processes are causally unrelated .",
    "a causal relation is difficult to demonstrate even in the case of the sun , although the evidence for electron beam heating in many solar flares is compelling .",
    "a causal relation between particle acceleration and coronal heating is however supported if the energy in the non - thermal electrons is sufficient to heat the observed plasma .",
    "further , this energy should not be radiated away by the high - energy particles but be transported to the chromosphere on time scales shorter than the radiative loss time .",
    "an accurate calculation requires information that is not at hand , but we present estimates for a plausibility analysis as follows : by estimating the gyrosynchrotron radio flux and assuming reasonable magnetic field strengths and electron distributions , we infer the total kinetic energy in the electrons at any given time . by integrating the energy across the flare",
    ", we can compare the total injected energy with the total x - ray losses .",
    "for such an order - of - magnitude estimate , we will assume that the shape of the electron distribution stays constant ( see below ) , and that variable radio self - absorption is not relevant .",
    "we perform the estimates for a range of given but , in each case , constant values of the magnetic field strength and of the slope of the electron distribution .",
    "non - thermal electrons in stellar coronae and solar flares are usually distributed in energy in a power law of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the time - dependent number density of electrons in the energy interval @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath37 is the lower cutoff energy for the distribution of non - thermal electrons , @xmath38 is the normalization constant , viz . the volumetric number density of electrons at time @xmath39 above @xmath37 , and @xmath40 is the power - law index ( typically @xmath41 in solar flares , @xcite ) . in solar flares",
    ", there is evidence that one and the same electron power - law distribution comprises the ( lower - energy ) hard - x - ray emitting electrons and the ( higher - energy ) microwave - emitting electrons @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is unknown but must be @xmath42 in order to confine the total non - thermal energy @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath43  kev .",
    "this is likely to be a lower limit for solar flares where @xmath44  kev may be more appropriate @xcite",
    ".    radio flare emission from rs cvn binaries at 5  ghz is often optically thick @xcite .",
    "optically thick emission from a simple source should stay constant , independent of the number of injected electrons , but this is not usually observed @xcite , indicating that the number of electrons itself is responsible for continually changing the optically thick cross section , e.g. , by being injected in a variable number of magnetic loops .",
    "we will thus assume that the volume filled by non - thermal electrons is generally time - dependent .",
    "the radio spectral index at optically thick low frequencies is typically + 1 , while the index on the high - frequency optically thin side is between @xmath10.5 and @xmath11 @xcite . the turnover frequency ( above which the radiation changes to optically thin ) is similar in many reported flares , @xmath45  ghz although values as low as a few ghz are possible @xcite . from this typical spectral model shape",
    ", we can estimate the unabsorbed luminosity at 5  ghz to be @xmath46 times higher than measured .",
    "the unabsorbed radio flux @xmath47 ( taken to be 5 times the observed flux in what follows ) relates to the gyrosynchrotron emissivity @xmath48 , for which @xcite gave the following approximation for the magnetoionic x - mode : @xmath49 ( in erg  @xmath50  s@xmath13  hz@xmath13  sr@xmath13 ) . @xmath51 ( in units of gauss ) is the magnetic field strength ( assumed to be constant in the source ) , and @xmath52  [ hz ] is the electron gyrofrequency .",
    "we will use @xmath53 for the total emissivity , assuming a similar emissivity for the o - mode which is approximately valid under typical coronal conditions .",
    "we note that in general the o - mode emissivity is smaller @xcite ; we thus overestimate @xmath48 somewhat , and hence we will underestimate the total energy content in the electrons accordingly .",
    "since most of the emission is radiated by electrons with large pitch angles , we set @xmath54 in what follows .",
    "this represents an average for a uniform pitch angle distribution with @xmath55 around 3 in equation  [ emissivity ] .",
    "the radio flux then is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the source volume , @xmath58 is the distance to the source , and @xmath59 collects various terms from equation  [ emissivity ] . the total instantaneous kinetic energy in the electron distribution ( given in equation [ distribution ] )",
    "is @xmath60 where @xmath61 has been assumed . the expression @xmath62 is obtained from equation  [ luminosity ] with the known radio flux @xmath47 .",
    "we finally need to specify values for @xmath55 and @xmath51 .",
    "our single - frequency observation is not sufficient to derive these values .",
    "however , from a large body of published modeling results , likely values are within the ranges @xmath63 and @xmath64  g ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the range @xmath65 .",
    "travel times of electrons of 10@xmath1100  kev along a magnetic loop of @xmath66  cm are of order 1  s , i.e. , if the electrons all get lost in the deeper atmospheric layers , then equation  [ energy ] gives the energy that should be replaced every second .",
    "however , radio - emitting electrons are probably trapped in magnetic fields for some time by virtue of their large pitch angles , while a large fraction of the lower - energy electrons that carry most of the energy to heat the chromosphere arrive there earlier .",
    "the decay time @xmath67 can not exceed the synchrotron loss time @xmath68 , @xmath69}\\ ] ] @xcite , where @xmath70 is the lorentz factor of the electrons . for electrons observed at a frequency @xmath71 , @xmath72",
    "substituting @xmath73 and inserting @xmath70 into equation  [ taus ] leads to @xmath74}.\\ ] ] for our ranges of @xmath51 , @xmath75 is minimized for @xmath76  g , @xmath77  s. however , the fastest observed decay times in the radio light curve are of order 2000  s and possibly as small as 1000  s. we conclude that , in the framework of our simplistic model , losses other than synchrotron losses ( most likely scattering into the loss cone and precipitation into the chromosphere , possibly also collisional losses ) predominate .",
    "we henceforth adopt an upper limit to the lifetime of radio - emitting electrons of @xmath78  s.    the total energy injection rate is thus overestimated from the radio information .",
    "starting at time @xmath79 and assuming that the complete particle distribution ` decays ' independently of energy by continuously losing energy ( by various processes as mentioned above ) and thus eventually thermalizing , the instantaneous number of radio - emitting particles evolves as @xmath80)\\over dt^{\\prime}}e^{-(t - t^{\\prime})/\\tau}dt^{\\prime}\\ ] ] where @xmath81/dt \\ge 0 $ ] is the injection rate of new electrons .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side describes the decaying density of particles already present at @xmath82 , while the second term describes the evolution of newly injected electrons .",
    "we note that equation  [ evolution ] implies a convolution of the electron injection rate with a cut - off exponential function .",
    "the injection rate should thus peak considerably before the observed peak of @xmath83 if @xmath67 were large .",
    "we take the very close temporal coincidence between the radio light curve and the derivative of the x - ray light curve as further a - posteriori support for a small energy loss time for the high - energy electrons . for @xmath84",
    "s , the time delay between peak injection rate and peak @xmath62 is negligible , while for @xmath78  s , it amounts to about 1000  s , which is still rather small .",
    "equation  [ evolution ] implies @xmath85\\over dt } = { d[n(t)v(t)]\\over dt } + { n(t)v(t)\\over \\tau}.\\ ] ] in what follows , we subtract the apparently quiescent emission level of 3  mjy from the radio light curve ( figure 1c ) . the expression involving @xmath86 in equation  [ evolution ] can therefore be neglected , also because of the rather rapid decay time .",
    "it is easy to show that the rate of electron injection @xmath81/dt$ ] is positive at a given time @xmath39 if the observed decay time scale of @xmath87 is larger than the assumed intrinsic decay time @xmath67 of the electron population .",
    "since the latter is a necessary condition , we fulfil @xmath81/dt > 0 $ ] by adopting a value for @xmath67 at the lower limit of the measured decay time scales in the radio light curve , as done above .    when the rate of change in the derived instantaneous energetic - particle number @xmath62 is small ( first term on the right - hand side of equation  [ rate ] , e.g. , around the radio peak time ) , then the injection rate of particles is equal to @xmath88 , and the injected power analogously equals the total energy content divided by @xmath67 .",
    "the total number of injected electrons can be obtained by integrating equation  [ rate ] in time across the complete radio flare ( time interval [ @xmath89,@xmath90 = [ 1.03,1.32 ]  d ) .",
    "since the radio light curve approximately returns to the pre - flare level , @xmath62 in equation  [ luminosity ] returns to the same value ; thus , the first term in equation  [ rate ] does not contribute to the integral , and the total number of injected electrons is @xmath91 the total injected energy can then be obtained from @xmath92 ( equivalent to equation  [ energy ] ) .",
    "we have performed the integration  [ integral ] for the @xmath51 and @xmath55 values allowed here . the result is graphically shown in figure  [ contour ] . for the selected parameter range ,",
    "the total injected energy is of order @xmath93  erg .",
    "we compare this energy with the total energy loss in the second x - ray flare after 1.03  d. judged from the count rate , the excess luminosity above the slow decay from the first flare peak reaches @xmath94  erg  s@xmath13 . with a half - duration of about 0.15  d",
    ", we obtain a total radiated energy of @xmath95  erg .",
    "this value compares favorably with the estimates in figure  [ contour ] .",
    "while there is no proof for a causal relation between high - energy electrons and coronal heating , the energy budget is compatible with such a scenario for a reasonable range of parameters @xmath96 .",
    "we note that , within the framework of our simplified model assumptions , our energy estimate is conservative .",
    "the lifetime @xmath67 of the non - thermal electron population has been adopted at the highest possible value compatible with the radio light curve ( i.e. , approximately equal to the shortest decay time scale in the observed radio emission ) .",
    "equation  [ integral ] shows that a shorter possible lifetime requires a proportionately larger total energy input . in that case , the light curve variability is controlled by the time scales of the particle accelerator . if electrons get lost after one magnetic - loop crossing time , then @xmath97 a few seconds for typical loop sizes , and the rapid replenishment of electrons requires an energy input into the system up to 3 orders of magnitude higher than estimated above .",
    "we conclude that not only does the relative timing between radio and x - ray emissions support the chromospheric evaporation scenario , but the total energy content in the injected high - energy electrons could easily satisfy or largely exceed the requirements set by the observed x - ray losses .",
    "the observation described here provides strong support for the chromospheric evaporation scenario in a star that may maintain a corona considerably different from the sun s ( e.g. , containing much larger magnetic loops , confining much hotter and perhaps also denser thermal plasma , magnetic field lines that may be arranged in the form of large global dipoles , possibly also between the companion stars , etc ) .",
    "in retrospect , we find a similar timing between radio and x - ray flare events in some previously published light curves , although the neupert effect was not discussed .",
    "most evidently , radio emission peaking before the soft x - rays , thus suggesting the presence of a neupert effect , can be seen in the examples presented by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "clearly , differing behavior has been noted as well .",
    "first , the sun shows the neupert effect most reliably in the class of impulsive flares , whereas 50% of all gradual flares , often related to energy release at high coronal altitudes , show a different behavior @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the connectivity of magnetic fields between the high corona and the chromospheric regions is different in these cases , impeding the free flow of electrons and consequent chromospheric evaporation .",
    "thermalization of fast electrons could also occur in the corona already if the travel distances are long enough and the densities high enough .",
    "stellar counter - examples of the neupert effect include an impulsive optical flare with following gradual radio emission @xcite , gyrosynchrotron emission that peaks after the soft x - rays @xcite , and an x - ray depression during strong radio flaring @xcite . note also that complete absence of correlated flaring has been observed at radio and uv wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for chromospheric evaporation in an rs cvn binary system is potentially important to understand to what degree the solar analogy can be applied to such stellar systems . although magnetospheric sizes as measured in radio waves are several times larger than the sun , vlbi observations have suggested that flares start out in compact , unresolved cores that are well localized in magnetic active regions close to the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "our observations of a neupert effect strongly suggest solar analogy in the physics of energy release and transport in this binary system , at least for the large flare reported here .",

    "<S> this observation can be interpreted in terms of a standard flare scenario in which accelerated coronal electrons reach the chromosphere where they heat the cool plasma and induce chromospheric evaporation . </S>",
    "<S> such a scenario can only hold if the amount of energy in the fast electrons is sufficient to explain the x - ray radiative losses . </S>",
    "<S> we present a plausibility analysis that supports the chromospheric evaporation model . </S>"
