    "when matter is strongly coupled to light , the interaction can not simply be thought of in terms of absorption and emission processes .",
    "instead we must consider the eigenstates of the fully coupled matter - light system .",
    "the paradigmatic example of this is the existence of exciton polaritons , hybrid matter - light particles formed by the strong interaction between excitons and photons  @xcite .",
    "matter - light coupling can be engineered by confining light in optical cavities , so as to modify the density of states and the coupling to matter . for weak coupling , or a bad cavity , cavity losses",
    "are fast so one can eliminate virtual processes where photons are in the cavity .",
    "this gives fermi s golden rule , but with the cavity density of states modifying the emission rate , as first discussed by purcell  @xcite .",
    "when coupling is strong , first order perturbation theory ( i.e.  fermi s golden rule ) fails , as there can instead be coherent emission and reabsorption of photons before light leaks out of the cavity  @xcite .",
    "a natural context in which strong matter - light coupling arises is between organic molecules and light in semiconductor microcavities . because of the existence of conjugated @xmath0 bonds in organic molecules",
    ", electronic transitions can acquire large dipole moments  @xcite , leading to very strong coupling to light .",
    "when such molecules are placed in optical microcavities this leads to huge polariton splittings  @xcite .",
    "these scales allow such experiments to be performed at room temperature , whereas for many inorganic materials , cryogenic temperatures are required .",
    "the polariton splitting is due to a collective phenomenon : the electronic transitions of many molecules couple to radiation , and as such the polariton splitting grows as the square root of the molecule density .",
    "in contrast , in weak coupling , the rate at which one molecule emits is independent of whether or not any other molecules are present  @xcite .",
    "much of the recent work on organic microcavity polaritons ( see , e.g.ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) has been focused on condensation and lasing  @xcite , involving a strongly pumped system , and the appearance of macroscopic quantum coherence .",
    "there has however also been significant recent work on the effects of matter - light coupling in the vacuum state , i.e.  without strong pumping .",
    "such work aims to understand how the physical and chemical properties of organic molecules are affected by strong coupling to electromagnetic modes .",
    "examples of this include modifying the rates of photochemical reactions  @xcite , or modifying the transport properties of organic semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "more recently , there has also been experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite work on coupling the vibrational state of organic molecules to infra - red radiation , leading to molecular optomechanics .",
    "theoretical work  @xcite has also studied how strong matter - light coupling to electronic states can suppress the effects of disorder and vibronic features in the polariton spectrum .",
    "of particular interest for the present paper is a recent work from the ebbesen group  @xcite , in which the optical spectra of strongly - coupled organic microcavities were studied by varying molecular concentration and temperature , and paying particular attention to the relative weights of the resonant features in the absorption spectra : the two polariton peaks , and a third peak at the bare excitonic energy  @xcite .",
    "our aim in this manuscript is to examine the behavior of such strongly - coupled organic microcavities starting from various microscopic models , allowing quantitative predictions of the extent to which a self - consistent adaptation of the molecular state , driven by coupling with light , may occur .    to understand the variation of the optical spectra with both concentration and temperature the models which we consider all contain a variable degree of coupling to light .",
    "this is because a molecule that has strictly zero coupling to light is not visible in the absorption spectrum , while molecules with a small but non - zero coupling will lead to absorption at the bare molecular energy . in order that the coupling to light can vary self consistently ( in response to the rabi splitting ) , it must depend on some adaptable feature of the state or environment of the molecule .",
    "i.e.  there must be some physical property that can vary , which determines the strength of matter - light coupling .",
    "we refer to this concept hereafter as `` self - consistent molecular adaptation '' .",
    "we refer to this process as `` self - consistent '' because the effective matter - light coupling depends on ( some aspect of ) the molecular state , and the molecular state is modified because of how its energy depends on the matter - light coupling . in the first part of this manuscript we investigate in detail two candidates that could lead to self - consistent adaptation : rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom , we also consider an extension of these models to generic ( classical ) aspects of the molecules physical or chemical state . while we do find a temperature dependence of the optical spectra , the involved energy scales turn out to be incompatible with the observation of ref .  @xcite . in the final part of the present work ,",
    "we examine how our model of vibrationally dressed polaritons naturally predicts an effect whose energy scale is of the right magnitude to explain the data . this effect does not involve the renormalization of the coupling strength , but instead involves the effect of vibrational replicas and their coupling to the excitonic transition on the optical spectra .",
    "our results thus show a first example of the rich , and presently poorly understood behavior that can stem from the interplay of strong matter - light coupling with strong coupling to vibrational / conformational modes of the molecules .",
    "we start by noting that the existence of a peak at the bare energy of the exciton , brought forward as evidence of novel physics in ref .",
    "@xcite , is not unexpected ; such a `` residual excitonic peak '' has been seen in many cases , for example ref .",
    "@xcite discussed theoretically , and demonstrated experimentally , the appearance of such a feature in a gaas / algaas heterostructure , containing quantum wells inside a dbr microcavity .",
    "while such a peak comes from the spectral weight of the exciton line , it is important to note that this peak _ can not _ be viewed simply as excitons which do not couple to light : if they did not couple , they would not be visible in the absorption or transmission spectrum .",
    "the origin of the peak can be understood physically as coming from the subradiant excitonic states due to inhomogeneous broadening . in a disordered system",
    ", the coupling to the photon mode picks out a specific superradiant state , which forms the polaritons , while the other states  orthogonal to this superradiant state  remain at the bare exciton energies .",
    "however , because of energetic disorder , the superradiant state is not an energy eigenstate , and a residual coupling between the superradiant and subradiant states exists , so that the spectral weight of the subradiant states is visible in the optical spectrum  @xcite .",
    "a simple analytical treatment shows that the weight of this residual excitonic peak does decrease as the matter - light coupling increases .",
    "the existence of this peak is thus consistent with the behavior seen in  @xcite .",
    "however , on its own this explanation can not account for the temperature dependence observed , as the residual excitonic peak should be unaffected by temperature , unless @xmath1 approaches optical energies , of the order of @xmath2 ( for comparison 300k@xmath3mev ) .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to address how this temperature dependence may occur .",
    "as will become clear in the following , to discuss the microscopic theory of such effects , it will be crucial to consider the physics of ultrastrong matter - light coupling  @xcite , and the breakdown of the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "this requires retaining `` counter - rotating '' terms in the matter - light coupling hamiltonian .",
    "these terms , which involve simultaneous creation of pairs of excitations , are typically considered to be non - resonant and so are often neglected . however ,",
    "if the matter - light coupling is a significant fraction of the bare exciton and photon energies , then these terms have a non - negligible impact .",
    "such behavior has been seen in both inorganic  @xcite and organic  @xcite systems , with a current record of a coupling strength @xmath4 of the bare oscillator frequency  @xcite .",
    "our focus in this paper is on the more typical regime where such counter - rotating terms can not be neglected , but remain sufficiently small to be treated perturbatively .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured in two main sections . in section  [ sec : rotational - freedom ] we consider how temperature dependence can arise due to self - consistent adaptation of the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecules , via a mechanism very similar to that proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the orientational degree of freedom ,",
    "we consider both free molecules , and molecules with randomly pinned orientations as appropriate in a polymer matrix .",
    "we will see that in such systems we do predict a temperature dependence of the residual excitonic peak .",
    "however , while this effect could potentially be observed in other experimental realizations , the energy scales ( temperatures ) required and the scaling with molecular concentration are not compatible with the experimental observations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in section  [ sec : vibrational - freedom ] we instead consider a different effect , arising from the interplay of vibrational modes with the matter - light coupling , which is able to reproduce similar behavior to that observed in experiments .",
    "specifically we find that vibrational excitations dress the residual excitonic peak in a strongly temperature dependent manner .",
    "moreover , the form of the vibrational dressed spectrum shows that the spectral feature at the exciton energy can have a more complex interpretation than that previously considered  @xcite .    a brief but self - contained account of the main theoretical methods used throughout this paper is given in the appendices .",
    "in this section we consider whether self - consistent molecular adaptation can enhance matter - light coupling by renormalizing the bare matter - light coupling strength .",
    "we consider models in which the effective matter - light coupling strength of a given molecule depends on the configuration of that molecule , such as its orientation , or its vibrational state .",
    "we then ask how this same matter - light coupling modifies the energy landscape for the auxiliary parameters describing the configuration .",
    "this leads to the idea of self consistency  if strong coupling leads to a reduction of the ground state energy , the energy landscape is deformed so as to favor auxiliary parameters for which the effective matter - light coupling is as large as possible .",
    "our aim is to derive this from a microscopic model , and so quantify this effect . in the following we consider two potential scenarios involving adaptation of either orientational or vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "if such a self - consistent enhancement of matter - light coupling occurs , then this can lead to a temperature dependent effective coupling , and thus to a temperature dependence of the residual excitonic peak .",
    "we show that such an effect exists , but that its strength is relatively weak , and that the relevant energy scale shows no collective enhancement , i.e.  the presence of @xmath5 molecules does not lead to a @xmath5 enhancement of this energy scale , because it must compete with the extensive entropy gain from orientational or vibrational disorder . as such , while increasing the molecular concentration will increase the polariton splitting , it has little effect on the self - consistent orientation . changing the bare oscillator strength of the molecules",
    "does however affect both the polariton splitting and the self - consistent molecular adaptation energy scale .    before introducing any auxiliary variables , the basic hamiltonian which we consider is an extended dicke model , including diamagnetic terms : @xmath6,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the field @xmath7 is written in terms of the bosonic creation and annihilation operators @xmath8 describing photon modes labeled by their in - plane momentum @xmath9 , and energy @xmath10 .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath11 describe the electronic state of the molecules . for completeness",
    ", we therefore also included the diamagnetic terms , arising from the @xmath12 term of the minimal coupling hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in order to consider varying the cavity mode volume while respecting the thomas - reiche - kuhn sum rule  @xcite we use @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the oscillator strength of the given molecule .",
    "the coefficient @xmath15 depends on the electric field strength of a single photon , and the properties of the effective charges that respond to the field .",
    "if we assume an uniform distribution of molecules , momentum conservation can be used to write the diamagnetic term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) as @xmath16 .",
    "this term can then be removed by a bogoliubov transformation @xmath17 , yielding the effective hamiltonian : @xmath18 where the on - site hamiltonian is given by @xmath19 and the renormalized parameters @xmath20 are : @xmath21 with @xmath5 the number of molecules in the mode volume .    in the dipole approximation , for a molecule with a single mobile electron @xmath22 with @xmath23 the mode volume and @xmath24 quantifying the electronic response of a single electron in terms of the vacuum permittivity @xmath25 and",

    "the spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : abs_simple ] , focusing on the residual excitonic peak , to show its dependence on the polariton splitting . as noted above ,",
    "such a feature has been observed and commented on several times before , e.g.  @xcite . when the polariton splitting @xmath46 is increased , the splitting between the lower and upper polaritons increases , and the exciton spectral weight of the feature at the exciton energy decreases .",
    "the asymmetry between the shift of the lower and upper polaritons arises due to the diamagnetic term @xmath47 renormalizing the photon energy . if the coupling to light is weak , so that the rwa is valid , this asymmetry vanishes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : abs_simple ] ( b ) we show how the spectrum is modified by including the effects of cavity losses and non - radiative excitonic decay as described in appendix  [ sec : absorpt - transm - refl ] .",

    "we return to this point in later sections .    for both the orientational and vibrational degrees of freedom ,",
    "our aim is to find how the matter - light coupling is self - consistently modified by these auxiliary degrees of freedom : i.e.  how the presence of matter - light coupling modifies the distribution of orientational or vibrational states , and how this in turn affects the effective matter - light coupling strength .",
    "we consider a case without any strong pumping , and with a temperature such that @xmath72 , which is typically satisfied even at room temperature for organic polaritons . as such , the origin of the `` self - consistent '' dependence of configuration on the matter - light coupling coupling arises due to the existence of the counter - rotating terms in the original hamiltonian : if these terms were neglected then the energy in the ground state sector can be trivially found as the ground state would correspond to the empty state , and its energy would therefore not involve the matter - light coupling strength at all  @xcite .",
    "the presence of counter - rotating terms means that the ground state sector also involves an admixture of all even parity sectors , and the degree of admixture depends on the effective matter - light coupling .    as discussed below , while exact solutions are possible in some limiting cases of the orientational problem , these are not generally possible at finite temperature , nor for the vibrational problem .",
    "this is because thermal or quantum fluctuations of the auxiliary degrees of freedom break translational symmetry , preventing simple exact diagonalization . as such , we proceed using the schrieffer - wolff formalism  @xcite , which allows us to consider perturbatively the effects of these counter - rotating terms , and how they modify the energy landscape seen by the auxiliary orientational or vibrational degrees of freedom . for completeness ,",
    "appendix  [ sec : schr - wolff - transf ] provides a brief summary of the schrieffer - wolff formalism .",
