    "the problem of the restoration in dense or hot matter of the chiral symmetry of the strong interactions , which is spontaneously violated in the qcd vacuum has been extensively addressed .",
    "the interest has largely focused on the quark condensate , considered as the order parameter . for independent particles the evolution of the quark condensate with density or temperature is governed by the sigma commutator of the particles present in the system with the simple following expression : @xmath0 where the sum extends over the species present in the medium , @xmath1 is their scalar density and @xmath2 their sigma commutator .",
    "pions play a crucial role in the restoration process especially in the heat bath where they enter as the lightest particles created by the thermal fluctuations . in the nuclear medium",
    "the main ingredients are the nucleons , with some corrections from the exchanged pions . at normal nuclear density",
    "the magnitude of the condensate has dropped by about 1/3 , a large amount of restoration .",
    "it is essentially the effect of the nucleons adding their effects independently , the corrections due to the interaction being small . such a large amount of restoration raises the question about manifestations directly linked to the symmetry . if there is no spontaneous violation of the symmetry , _ i.e.",
    "_ , if it is realized in the wigner mode , the hadron masses vanish or there exist parity doublets , each hadronic state being degenerate with its chiral partner .",
    "it is therefore legitimate to believe that the large amount of restoration at normal density manifests itself either by a decrease of the hadron masses , or by a mixing between opposite parities .",
    "a link between the evolution of the hadron masses and the amount of restoration has been suggested  @xcite .",
    "but it can not be a straightforward one .",
    "indeed the density or temperature evolution of the masses can not have a direct relation to that of the condensate , as follows from the works of several authors  @xcite . on the other hand the significance of chiral symmetry restoration for the parity mixing",
    "was first established by dey et al .",
    "@xcite for the thermal case .",
    "they showed that in a pion gas a mixing occurs between the vector and axial correlators .",
    "it arises from the emission or absorption of s - wave thermal pions , which changes the parity of the system .",
    "the mixing goes along with a quenching effect of the correlators , which , to first order in the pion density , equals 4/3 of the quenching of the quark condensate .",
    "these points were also made by steele et al .",
    "the extension of the formalism of dey et al . to finite densities has been attempted by krippa  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is the discussion of the implications of chiral symmetry restoration in the nuclear medium , in a world restricted here to nucleons and pions .",
    "the only transitions allowed in the nucleus are then nuclear transitions or pion production .",
    "we give the explicit expressions of the axial and vector current in a formalism based on chiral lagrangians .",
    "we will show that the nuclear pions renormalize the coupling constants of the axial current and that the renormalization can be expressed in terms of the pion scalar density .",
    "this last quantity also enters in the quark condensate evolution .",
    "however the complexity of the nuclear interactions bars a simple link between this evolution , which is an average concept , and the renormalizations .",
    "for instance , for the axial coupling constant @xmath3 the detailed spatial structure of the pion scalar density is needed .",
    "our article is organized as follows . in section 1",
    "we derive the expressions of the axial and vector currents from the chiral lagrangians . in section 2",
    "we use these expressions to study the renormalization of the pion decay constant in the hot pion gas and in the nuclear medium .",
    "the thermal case is only introduced as an illustration of the method since the results are already known . in section 3",
    "we apply the same technique to the axial coupling constant . to account for the nucleon - nucleon correlations we express the renormalization in the traditional treatment by the meson exchange currents .",
    "we give an estimate of the quenching of the axial coupling constant .",
    "we also discuss the renormalization of the kroll - ruderman matrix element of pion photoproduction .",
    "our starting point is the chiral lagrangian in the form introduced by weinberg .",
    "we use , as in our previous work of ref .",
    "@xcite , the version of lynn  @xcite , which allows one to obtain the nucleon sigma commutator in the tree approximation .",
    "the lagrangian writes : @xmath4    we have to specify the quantity @xmath5 associated with the nucleon density in eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) .",
    "the free nucleon sigma commutator @xmath6 can not be entirely attributed to the pion cloud .",
    "we define @xmath5 to be the difference between the total and pionic contributions : @xmath7    for instance in a description of the nucleon in terms of valence quarks and pions , the pionic contribution is approximatively 1/2 to 2/3 of the total value  @xcite .    from the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) we derive the expressions of the axial and isovector vector currents : @xmath8}{\\displaystyle ( 1 + { \\hbox{\\boldmath$\\phi $ \\unboldmath}}^2/4f_{\\pi}^2)^2 } \\nonumber \\\\      &   & + \\frac{g_a}{2}\\overline{\\psi}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\gamma_5 { \\hbox{\\boldmath$\\tau $ \\unboldmath}}\\psi + \\frac{g_a}{4f_{\\pi}^2}\\frac{\\displaystyle\\overline{\\psi}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\gamma_5 \\big[{\\hbox{\\boldmath$(\\tau\\times\\phi)\\times\\phi $ \\unboldmath}}\\big]\\psi } { \\displaystyle 1 + { \\hbox{\\boldmath$\\phi $ \\unboldmath}}^2/4f_{\\pi}^2 } -\\frac{1}{2f_{\\pi}}\\frac{\\displaystyle\\overline{\\psi}\\gamma_{\\mu } { \\hbox{\\boldmath$(\\tau\\times\\phi ) $ \\unboldmath}}\\psi } { \\displaystyle 1 + { \\hbox{\\boldmath$\\phi $ \\unboldmath}}^2/4f_{\\pi}^2 } \\label{acur }    \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the divergence of the axial current instead satisfies the following relation : @xmath9    some comments on the expressions  ( [ acur ] ) and  ( [ vcur ] ) are in order .",
    "let us first discuss the free case .",
    "we recognize in some of the terms the usual expressions for the vector or axial current coupled to a free nucleon or pion .",
    "in addition the axial current can create one or more pions , either in free space ( first terms of eq .",
    "( [ acur ] ) ) , or when it acts on the nucleon via a term ( last one of eq .",
    "( [ acur ] ) ) which is the equivalent for the axial current of the weinberg - tomozawa term of @xmath10-n scattering .",
    "similarly the vector current acting on the nucleon can create one ( or more ) pion via the kroll - ruderman term , _",
    "i.e. _ the contact piece of photoproduction ( last term of eq .",
    "( [ vcur ] ) ) .",
    "let us now turn to the case of a hadronic medium .",
    "the expressions  ( [ acur ] ) and ( [ vcur ] ) illustrate in a striking fashion the way in which the axial and vector current mixing occurs . indeed , in the heat bath any of the pions can be a thermal one . as an example , consider the kroll - ruderman term of the vector current , ignoring at this stage the denominator .",
    "the creation or annihilation of a thermal pion of momentum @xmath11 in this term takes care of the pion field , leaving a factor @xmath12 and we are left with a current of opposite parity , to be taken at the momentum transfer @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the photon momentum , as in the formalism of ref .",
    "similarly the pion production or annihilation by the weinberg term of the axial current introduces the vector current nuclear matrix element . to the extent that the weinberg term is mediated by the rho meson and the kroll - ruderman one by the @xmath15 meson ,",
    "these expressions include the effects , at low momenta , of the @xmath16 mixing .",
    "it is interesting to observe on expressions  ( [ acur ] ) and ( [ vcur ] ) that the kroll - ruderman term itself can be obtained from the fourth term of the axial current by suppression of one of the pion fields ( representing creation or annihilation of a thermal pion ) .",
    "thus the three terms containing @xmath3 in eqs  ( [ acur ] ) and ( [ vcur ] ) are linked together by suppression or addition of one pion field .",
    "the same is true for the three purely pionic terms and for the three terms in @xmath17 as well .",
    "thus a grouping three by three of the various terms naturally emerges from our expressions .    in the nuclear medium",
    "the virtual pions can be seen as a pion bath and similar considerations about the mixing might apply .",
    "however the pions do not come from an external reservoir but fully belong to the nucleus .",
    "strictly speaking there is no mixing .",
    "however the mixing terms of the currents can pick a pion from the cloud of a nucleon introducing a similarity with the heat bath as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig - figc ] in the case of the kroll - ruderman term .",
    "the corresponding process is the excitation of high lying nuclear states ( 2p-2h ) . in the case of the third isospin component of the current ,",
    "it is part of the well known quasi - deuteron photoabsorption cross - section .",
    "another example is the influence of the weinberg - tomozawa term on the time part of the axial current , which enters via the pauli correlations and sizeably increases the time - like axial coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "the present approach puts these effects , where the mixing terms of the currents pick a pion from the cloud , in a perspective linked to chiral symmetry .",
    "the mixing goes along with a renormalization of certain coupling constants , such as the axial one , that will now be discussed .",
    "we start with the case of the hot pion gas .",
    "this is meant as an illustration of our method as no new result is reached .",
    "it serves to introduce quantities such as the residue @xmath18 ( _ i.e. _ , the wave function renormalization ) that will be used later .",
    "the production of a pion by the axial current is governed by the first two terms of the expression  ( [ acur ] ) .",
    "limiting the expansion to first order in the squared pion field we obtain : @xmath19 the pion field is expanded in terms of creation and annihilation operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 for a quasi - pion in the medium : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the energy of a quasi - pion of momentum * k * , @xmath24 with @xmath25 the effective pion mass .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 is the residue of the pion pole . since the derivative of the pion field gives no contribution when it acts on the pions of the bath , the matrix element for production of a quasi - pion by the axial current reduces to : @xmath26 where the second equation defines the renormalized pion decay constant @xmath27 . in a pion gas",
    "the residue @xmath18 has been derived by chanfray et al .",
    "to first order in the quantity @xmath28 , equivalently the pion density , it writes , in the weinberg representation : @xmath29 the renormalized pion decay constant then reads : @xmath30 on the other hand , the temperature evolution of the condensate in a hot pion gas is , to first order in the quantity @xmath28 , as given in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath31 thus to first order in @xmath32 the renormalization of @xmath33 follows the evolution of the condensate but with the coefficient 2/3 , in agreement with chiral perturbation results and other works  @xcite .",
    "note that this renormalization applies to both space and time components of the axial current .",
    "this agrees with the findings of ref  @xcite where it is shown that to order @xmath34 lorentz invariance is preserved .",
    "we now turn to the dense medium .",
    "formally we can follow the same procedure .",
    "the presence in the nuclear medium of a pion scalar density , in the form of an expectation value of the quantity @xmath28 , renormalizes the pion decay constant .",
    "formally the expression is the same as previously , @xmath35 . if we treat the nuclear medium as a pion gas , the residue @xmath18 entirely arises from @xmath10-@xmath10 interactions and is the same as given previously in eq .",
    "( [ res ] ) . in this simplified treatment @xmath27 is given by eq .",
    "( [ fpist ] ) .",
    "it is linked to the pion scalar density , _",
    "i.e. _ the expectation value @xmath28 .",
    "even with the simple form  ( [ fpist ] ) , the renormalization of @xmath36 does not follow 2/3 of the condensate one .",
    "the reason is that the condensate evolution in the nuclear medium is governed by the full nucleon sigma commutator @xmath6 , which is not entirely due to @xmath28 .",
    "there exists also the non pionic contribution embodied in @xmath5 , as discussed previously .",
    "thus the two renormalizations do not follow each other .",
    "this result is general and applies as well to the axial coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "this is not the only restriction which prevents a simple link to the condensate in the nuclear medium .",
    "the residue @xmath18 itself is not entirely due to @xmath10-@xmath10 scattering .",
    "there exist other sources for the energy dependence of the s - wave @xmath10-n interaction , such as the @xmath37 excitation .",
    "the medium renormalization of @xmath36 can not be written in the simple form  ( [ fpist ] ) .",
    "this illustrates the complexity of the dense medium as compared to the hot pion gas .",
    "a more phenomenological approach has been followed by chanfray et al .",
    "@xcite who linked the in - medium pion decay constant through the nuclear gell - mann - oakes - renner relation to the evolution of the pion mass , itself obtained empirically from the s - wave pion - nucleus optical potential .",
    "we now turn to the axial coupling constant .",
    "its renormalization is governed by the fourth term of eq .",
    "( [ acur ] ) . after rearrangement with the gamow - teller current ( third term ) , we get : @xmath38 where on the right hand side the average is taken over the heat bath . on the other hand the condensate is obtained from the chiral symmetry breaking lagrangian @xmath39 . therefore the condensate evolution follows  @xcite : @xmath40 hence the axial coupling constant renormalized by the pion loops ( fig .",
    "[ fig - figb]a ) can be written : @xmath41 thus with this chiral lagrangian , in a hot medium the axial coupling constant follows , to all orders in the pion density , 2/3 of the quark condensate evolution ( as long as it is pion dominated ) . the factor 2/3 is easily understood here : only two charges out of three contribute to the renormalization while all three charge states participate in the condensate evolution .",
    "the quenching of @xmath3 is in agreement with the universal behaviour of ref .",
    "@xcite and with the former result of ref .",
    "we have checked the expected independence of our results on the particular representation of the non - linear lagrangian .",
    "we now turn to the case of finite density .",
    "the starting expression is the same as the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ axialr ] ) . in the nuclear medium",
    "the pions originate from the other nucleons so that the nucleon - nucleon correlations can not be ignored . here",
    "it is useful to make the link between this renormalization and the traditional picture of meson exchange currents .",
    "we keep only the two - body terms which are the dominant ones and work to lowest order in the pion field .",
    "the corresponding graph is that of fig .",
    "[ fig - figb]b .",
    "this type of exchange graph with two pions is not usually considered in nuclear physics .",
    "it is dictated to us only by these chiral symmetry considerations .",
    "we have to express the triangular graph of the figure as an effective two - body operator to be evaluated between correlated two - nucleon wave functions .",
    "a simplification occurs in the static approximation where the pions do not transfer energy to the nucleon line .",
    "we are left with an integral over the squared pion propagator with leads to a simple form in @xmath42-space for the two - body operator :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the yukawa field , taken at the point @xmath45 , emitted by the nucleon located at the point @xmath46  and we have made explicit the dependence in the isospin operator @xmath47  of the emitting nucleon .",
    "the operator @xmath48 has a direct and an exchange contribution .",
    "the latter contribution vanishes for the second piece of the two - body operator in the limit of zero momentum current .",
    "we will furthermore ignore the exchange term of the first piece ( _ i.e. _ in @xmath49 ) and consider only the short range correlations .",
    "we now focus on the direct terms and specialize to the charged currents .",
    "the isospin factors in eq .",
    "( [ otb ] ) reduce to the expression @xmath50 .",
    "the resulting contributions depend on the relative number of protons and neutrons .",
    "in symmetric nuclear matter where they are equal , the factor , once summed over all the pion emitters ( the nucleons with index 2 ) , gives @xmath51 multiplied by the nuclear density @xmath52 . in the neutron gas instead , depending whether we consider neutron decay ( the @xmath53 component ) or proton decay ( the @xmath54 one ) , we would get a factor @xmath55 or @xmath56 multiplied by the neutron density @xmath57 .",
    "we can summarize these results by introducing an effective density , which depends on the charge of the current and on the neutron excess number : @xmath58 from which we recover the previous results . sandwiching the whole operator @xmath48 between two - nucleon wave functions ,",
    "we thus obtain :    @xmath59 \\varphi^2 ( { \\hbox{\\boldmath$x_1,x_2$\\unboldmath}})\\ ; , \\label{gad}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 is the short range nucleon - nucleon correlation function . in symmetric nuclear matter @xmath61",
    "whereas a similar formula would hold in the neutron gas , with the obvious replacement of @xmath52 by the neutron density @xmath57 and of the factor 1/3 in front by 1/2 and 1/6 for neutron and proton decay respectively . as is apparent on the expression  ( [ gad ] ) it is not the full pion field squared which acts in the renormalization of @xmath3 , but only the part which extends beyond the range of the correlation hole .",
    "no such distinction occurred for the pion decay constant since the pion produced by the axial current can be anywhere in the nucleus .",
    "thus the universality of the quenching which exists in the heat bath is lost .    in order to obtain an estimate for @xmath62 in symmetric matter , we assume a total exclusion of other nucleons in a sphere of radius @xmath63 . in order to facilitate the comparison of the quenching effect of @xmath3 to that of the condensate which is governed by the nucleon sigma term , we introduce a quantity @xmath64 : @xmath65 numerically for point - like pion emitters , we find an effective value @xmath66 .",
    "it is interesting to compare this value with a model calculation in the quark picture .",
    "we have used the results of wakamatsu  @xcite in a chiral soliton model .",
    "the quantity @xmath67 is replaced by the sea quark density distribution according to : @xmath68 .",
    "this gives a very similar value @xmath69 .",
    "however these numbers do not include the pauli blocking effect which removes the occupied states in the process of pion emission .",
    "this effect has been calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite but for the whole space integral ( _ i.e. _ without a cut - off ) of the quantity @xmath28 .",
    "expressed in terms of a modification of the sigma commutator it amounts to a reduction @xmath70 .",
    "the blocking effect , which is moderate , should be even less pronounced with the cut - off .",
    "we ignore it in the following .",
    "coming back to the renormalized axial coupling constant , we have : @xmath71 this represents a 10% quenching at normal nuclear density in symmetric matter ( 15% for neutron decay in a neutron gas of the same density ) , while the condensate has dropped by 35% .",
    "notice that the evolution of @xmath3 is sizeably slower .",
    "this quenching applies to all the components , space or time , of the axial current .",
    "other renormalization effects have to be added .",
    "they are known to act differently on the different components .",
    "for instance the weinberg - tomozawa term acts on the time component alone , producing a sizeable enhancement  @xcite . in the case of the space component the nucleon polarization under the influence of the pion field",
    "@xmath72 leads to the lorentz - lorenz quenching  @xcite . in the latter case the two renormalizations go in the same direction of a quenching .",
    "the extra reduction that we have introduced in this work could help to explain the large amount of quenching observed in gamow - teller transitions .",
    "to get an idea , we fictitiously translate the reduction by chiral symmetry into an equivalent lorentz - lorenz effect .",
    "we introduce an effective landau - migdal parameter @xmath73 , to be added to the genuine one , so as to reproduce the 10% quenching .",
    "this corresponds to an increase @xmath74 , a significant increase .",
    "indeed the quenching of the gamow - teller sum rule requires , if all attributed to the lorentz - lorenz effect , @xmath75 to be as big as 0.6 - 0.7 while the favoured theoretical value is around 0.4  @xcite .",
    "hence the chiral induced quenching would help to fill the gap .",
    "closely related to the gamow - teller transition is the pion photoproduction at threshold through the kroll - ruderman term .",
    "to lowest order the nuclear transition is governed by the axial current .",
    "we want now to discuss how it is renormalized in the medium following chiral symmetry requirements .",
    "expanding to first order in @xmath76 and applying wick theorem , the relevant current writes : @xmath77 for the production of a quasi - pion in the medium , the renormalization @xmath78 of the amplitude involves again the residue @xmath18 : @xmath79    for illustrating the complexity of the situation we first assume that the residue is entirely given by @xmath80 scattering and take the value of eq .",
    "( [ res ] ) .",
    "moreover we ignore the correlation complications .",
    "we obtain then : @xmath81 which is 1/3 of the variation of the condensate , in contradistinction to the axial transitions where the factor is 2/3 .",
    "this result does not contradict the general expressions of dey et al .",
    "@xcite as the kroll - ruderman term represents already a mixing of the axial current into the vector one .",
    "this reduction factor could apply to other mixing amplitudes , but we have not established it .",
    "the evolution as 1/3 of the condensate one would apply in the hot pion gas situation . in the nuclear medium",
    "all the complications mentioned previously occur : the role of the correlations , the link between the condensate evolution and the expectation value of @xmath28 and the problem with the residue @xmath18 .",
    "this case cumulates all of the difficulties of the dense medium . in all instances",
    "the overall renormalization of the kroll - ruderman matrix element in the nuclear medium should be small .",
    "in conclusion we have investigated the behaviour of the nuclear medium in relation with chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "we have focused on the extension of the parity mixing concept between the axial and vector correlators , which exists in the hot pion gas . in the nuclear medium",
    "there is no mixing _",
    "stricto sensu_. indeed the pions , which induce the mixing , are not part of an external system , as in the thermal case , but they belong to the virtual pion cloud which is an integral part of the nucleus .",
    "we have shown that nevertheless certain consequences of the mixing survive .",
    "the nucleus behaves in certain respects as a pion reservoir .",
    "the virtual pion emitted by a nucleon acts , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - figa ] , on the remainder of the nucleus , _",
    "i.e. _ on the system of ( a-1 ) nucleons , as the pion of the heat bath .",
    "the mixing which does not exist at the level of the whole nucleus is present only at the sublevel of the ( a-1 ) nucleon system .",
    "this translates by the fact that , in the `` mixing '' cross - sections ( such as the quasi - deuteron photoabsorption one ) , at least one nucleon has to be ejected : the emitter or absorber of the pion . as for the heat bath , this pion reservoir produces a quenching of the axial coupling constants .",
    "since the pion originates from a neighbouring nucleon this renormalization is nothing else than a meson exchange contribution .",
    "it involves the exchange of two pions and has not been so far considered , to our knowledge .",
    "we have expressed the renormalizations in terms of the pion scalar density .",
    "the same quantity also enters in the quark condensate evolution .",
    "one can therefore think of a link between the two quantities , as occurs in the heat bath where the link is simple .",
    "there is however an important difference of the nuclear medium with respect to the heat bath : the renormalizations are not described by a universal quenching factor expressed in terms of the average squared pion field .",
    "the nucleonic observables such as @xmath3 are renormalized differently due the sensitivity to nucleon - nucleon short range correlations . in this case",
    "only that part of the pionic field which is beyond the correlation hole enters in the renormalization .",
    "this prevents the link to the condensate evolution which instead involves the average scalar density .",
    "this is an illustration of the point made by t. ericson  @xcite about the possible importance of the spatial fluctuations of the condensate .",
    "we have given an estimate for the quenching of the axial coupling constant arising from the requirements of chiral symmetry .",
    "although it is not very large ( about 10% ) , this additional quenching is significant and may help explain the large observed quenching of the gamow - teller sum rule .",
    "we have also discussed the photoproduction amplitude arising from the kroll - ruderman term .",
    "it represents a mixing term of the axial current into the vector one .",
    "we have shown that its evolution is slower than the axial coupling constant one .",
    "this work can be extended to enlarge the space .",
    "the first step is to include the delta excitation .",
    "another extension concerns the explicit introduction of the rho and the @xmath15 mesons , which the mixing of the axial and vector correlators allows to be excited either by the vector or by the axial current .",

    "<S> this renormalization corresponds to a new type of pion exchange currents , with two exchanged pions . </S>",
