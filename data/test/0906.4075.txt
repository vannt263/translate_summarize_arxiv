    "positron emission tomography ( pet ) is a functional imaging technique of growing importance in medical diagnostics .",
    "its powers lie in the ability to reveal biologically significant processes that can be used , for example , in cancer screening and in studying neurodegenerative diseases .",
    "conventional pet detectors employ scintillating inorganic crystals  @xcite as the gamma ray detection media .",
    "while crystal - based pet systems perform adequately for many applications there is motivation for seeking improvements of resolutions in energy , position , and time response to improve image quality and increasing overall sensitivity .",
    "liquid xenon ( lxe ) is another gamma ray detector technology  @xcite applicable to high resolution pet which may result in improved performance and reduced noise in images due to superior energy resolution , true 3-dimensional position reconstruction , and the capability for determining the compton scattering sequence  @xcite . energy resolution of 7% ( fwhm ) has been reported in small lxe detector tests by combining scintillation light and ionization charge measurements  @xcite .",
    "measuring charge in a drift chamber has been shown to provide 3-d sub - millimeter spatial resolution  @xcite because electron diffusion is very small  @xcite .",
    "in addition , sub - ns timing resolution has been achieved by measuring the scintillation light  @xcite .",
    "liquid xenon is also inexpensive compared to crystal detectors commonly used for pet .",
    "liquid xenon pet systems have the potential to reduce detector contributions to pet to the level of intrinsic limitations due to positron range and non - colinearity of the emitted photons .",
    "this paper deals with the energy resolution obtained from light and charge signals observed in a small lxe prototype detector as well as an investigation of the components influencing it and the sources of uncertainty which may inform the design of future detectors for pet .",
    "we have developed a concept for a micro - pet detector shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_pet ] that takes advantage of all the high resolution capabilities of lxe gamma ray detectors .",
    "scintillation light is measured by arrays of large area avalanche photodiodes ( laapd ) , which have been found to work well in lxe  @xcite .",
    "charge measurement is achieved by using a time projection chamber ( tpc ) , an approach successfully demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "photons entering the lxe produce prompt scintillation light and ionization which drifts under an electric field applied between the cathode and the anode of the tpc .",
    "the anode module ( not shown in fig .  [ fig_pet ] ) consists of a shielding grid followed by an array of wires preceding the anode which is segmented into strips perpendicular to the wires .",
    "the electron signal induced on the wires and collected by the strips provides a two dimensional ( x - y ) position measurement of the charge .",
    "the third coordinate ( z ) is obtained by measuring the electron drift time i.e. the difference between the time of the light flash and the electron arrival time on the anode . since every interaction",
    "is precisely recorded , compton scattering can be reconstructed giving information on the direction of each incoming photon providing the possibility to suppress accidental coincidences and scattering prior to reaching the detector .",
    "the expectations for performance under operating conditions for pet include sub - millimeter 3-d position resolution from charge , timing resolution of @xmath1  ns from scintillation light , energy resolution @xmath0% ( fwhm ) combining light and charge signals , and the ability to reconstruct compton scattering . spatial location of events obtained from the prompt distributed light signals will be used to reduce the ambiguities of associating the scintillation light and charge at high levels of activity .",
    "a simulation of the imaging performance of this system will be presented in a future publication  @xcite .",
    "as an initial step in studying lxe detectors for pet , we constructed a small test chamber ( 27  @xmath2 ) for simultaneous measurements of light and charge .",
    "the test chamber is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig_chamber ] .",
    "scintillation light was detected by two 1.6  cm diameter windowless laapds ( advanced photonics inc .",
    "the laapds were located at the center of the drift region as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_chamber ] , 1.5  cm above the grid wires and 1.5  cm below the cathode .",
    "charge was collected on a central 1  cm diameter electrode ( a1 ) or on an outer electrode ( a2 ) .",
    "an electric drift field was applied between the cathode and a shielding grid separated by 3  cm .",
    "the electric field was formed by a field cage consisting of 9 wires with a spacing of 3 mm strung along the four walls of the chamber .",
    "the voltage was distibuted by 100m@xmath3 resistors .",
    "the apds were outside the field cage and the distance between the field cage wires and the apds was 2 mm .",
    "the shielding grid consisted of 0.1  mm dia .",
    "wires spaced by 3  mm located 3  mm from the anode charge collection plane . the electric field between the grid wires and the anode was set higher than the drift field ensuring that all the electrons pass through the grid  @xcite . in order to study the influence of the drift field on quantities like charge and light production and the energy resolution several settings were used . with the grid at ground potential measurements",
    "were made with the negative cathode voltage set to 1 , 3 , 6 , and 8  kv , with the respective anode voltages set to 300 , 600 , 1200 and 1200  v. photons of 511  kev emitted after annihilation of positrons from a @xmath4na source with an activity of @xmath5 bq and situated in a collimator with an opening angle of 2@xmath6 positioned 30  cm away from the cathode entered the test chamber ( along the z axis ) through the cathode plane .",
    "the trigger was generated by selecting signals in coincidence of both apds and an external nai detector placed at a distance of 50 cm from the source observing the full energy of the other 511  kev photon from the positron annihilation .",
    "the probability to detect more than one event in the chamber at the same time was less than 3% .",
    "the detector was operated at 15 psia and at temperatures between 168 and 169 k. before inserting the liquid in the vessel holding the detector a bake - out in vaccuum at 7.6@xmath7 t was performed for 6 days at 60@xmath6c to clean the components .",
    "the purification of the xenon was done in the gas phase using two stages both with equipment from from nupure corporation  @xcite : first , the heated getter ( nupure omni 600 ) was used to remove h@xmath80 , o@xmath8 , co , h@xmath8 , and n@xmath8 to sub - ppb levels followed by a room temperature getter ( eliminator 600 cg ) to remove h@xmath80 , o@xmath8 , co , h@xmath8 , and hydrocarbons to @xmath9 0.5 ppb .",
    "the lifetime of drifting ionization electrons was used to indicate successful operation of the purification as discussed below .",
    "the two anodes segments and the grid wires ( ganged together ) were connected to charge - sensitive amplifiers followed by a 1  s time constant rc - cr shaper .",
    "the amplifier was calibrated using a narrow pulse input charge with a precision of 5% .",
    "the amplifier outputs were fanned out into three branches :    1 .",
    "a constant fraction discriminator followed by a time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) caen model v1190b ; 2 .   a charge sensitive analog - to - digital converter : 12 bit qdc caen model v792 with gate adjusted to the drift time and pulse shape ; and 3",
    ".   a 20  mhz sampling waveform digitizer vf48  @xcite .    to get absolute charge values ,",
    "the digitized waveform measured with the vf48 was used for the analysis presented in sections [ sec_q ] and [ sec_l ] .",
    "because the qdc had a better signal to noise ratio it was used to determine the energy resolution in section [ sec_e ] which did not require absolute charge calibration .",
    "the other reason the qdc was not used for absolute values was due to the very short pulse used for calibration .",
    "the longer chamber signal would not have been fully integrated within the window set .",
    "the observed range of noise of the amplifier was 700 - 1100 electrons due to varying external sources of induced noise . to reach the optimal position resolution , a signal to noise ratio larger than 5 was desirable requiring the electronics noise to be kept below 1000 electrons equivalent noise charge ( enc ) .",
    "a typical signal was expected to be at least 10 000  e- , as long as the electron attachment during the drift was small .",
    "the laapd voltages were set so that their gains were 500 and each was connected to a current - sensitive preamplifier with a pulse width of 50  ns and @xmath10 electrons enc .",
    "the amplifier signal was split into 3 branches :    1 .",
    "discriminator and tdc ; 2 .",
    "qdc caen model v792 with a gate of 100  ns ; and 3 .   1  ghz waveform digitizer caen model v1729 .",
    "solid angle calculations showed that 12% of the scintillation photons reached the laapds when the gamma interaction took place in the center of the chamber .",
    "the grid wires shielded the anodes from the current induced by the drifting electrons . once the ionization electrons passed the grid wires the signal on the anode started to build up with a pulse shape that was largely independent of the z position of the primary interaction although electrostatic calculations showed that the current pulse shape depended on the x - y distance of the electron cloud from the individual grid wires .",
    "furthermore , depending on the drift velocity ( typically 0.15 to 0.21  cm / s ) , the current induced on the anodes lasted 1.5 to 2  s.    the waveforms measured on the grid and on the two anodes provided information about the location of charge creation and compton scattering if multiple charge pulses were observed .",
    "the time of charge arrival relative to the light signal gave information about the position along the drift direction of the electrons .",
    "figure  [ fig_wave ] shows examples of four charge waveform events recorded by the 20  mhz waveform digitizers chosen to illustrate several types of events . in the upper two plots the charge was created roughly at the same z position ; in the left plot the signal of the central anode ( a1 ) integrated to zero and the anode a2 collected the charge , whereas in the right hand plot the interaction deposited the full charge on the central anode a1 .",
    "the lower left panel shows an event originating close to the cathode plane , resulting in a measured drift time of 15  s. the charge was collected by the central anode .",
    "the bipolar shape of the grid signal is clearly visible .",
    "the waveform measured on the grid depends on the z position of the interaction and is also influenced by electrons collected by the grid .",
    "the lower right panel shows two photon interactions , presumably one compton scattering and one photo - electric interaction .",
    "one interaction took place above a1 and one above a2 .",
    "the interactions were also separated in the drift direction so that a two peak structure is visible in the grid waveform .",
    "simulations of the setup showed that only a small fraction ( less than 5% ) of events fully contained on a1 have mutliple hits that can be detected .",
    "the total charge for these events however is not significantly different from the events with just one interaction . for this analysis",
    "we did not treat them separately since we were primarily interested in the total charge deposited on the anode .",
    "better separation of multiple photon interactions on an event by event basis will be possible with finer segmentation of the readout electrodes and shorter shaping time .",
    "the purity of the lxe has an impact on charge collection . in the current setup we achieved an electron lifetime of 200",
    "s using purification in the gas phase with heated getters .",
    "we estimated that the level of purity obtained would result in a loss of 8% of the electrons due to attachment .",
    "for the analysis in this paper we selected events where no net charge was measured on a2 . by demanding the absence of charge on a2 the region of a1 in which events",
    "were accepted was smaller than its physical size since charge depositions close to the edge of a1 induced charge on a2 .",
    "the effective radius of the tube in which events were accepted was estimated to be 0.45  cm compared to the a1 radius of 0.5  cm .",
    "figure  [ fig_charge ] shows the distribution of charge due to 511 kev photons incident on the chamber as measured on a1 as a function of the drift time for a 1  kv / cm drift field .",
    "the shape of the distribution is the same for all drift fields .",
    "the 511  kev band rises sharply in less than 1  s , and then falls slowly until the cutoff which corresponds to the edge of the chamber .",
    "the sharp rise corresponds to photons interacting between the grid and anode . in that case",
    "the electronics , which is not sensitive to the charge induced by the much slower drifting ions , measures only a fraction of the charge which is approximately proportional to the distance between the anode and the interaction point .",
    "when the interaction point is between the grid and the cathode , the measured charge should be independent of the interaction position .",
    "the decline of measured charge with increasing drift times is due to electron attachment by impurities in the lxe .",
    "compton scattering interactions are evident below the 511  kev band .",
    "they are due to photons entering the chamber with less than 511  kev because they have scattered in the passive detector material , mostly the 2 cm of lxe between the vessel wall and the cathode , and to photons escaping after a compton scattering interaction in the liquid .",
    "we performed a fit of the 511  kev band to extract the drift velocity @xmath11 , the total charge @xmath12 produced in the photon interaction and the attenuation length .",
    "the values obtained for these quantities are listed in table  [ tab_qresults ] with their statistical uncertainties from the fits .",
    "the charge yield @xmath13 is also shown along with @xmath12 which is the measured charge corrected for attachment and electronics calibration and @xmath14 is the ratio of the energy deposited by the @xmath15-ray and the average energy to produce an electron ion pair : @xmath16 with @xmath17=15.6 ev  @xcite .",
    ".drift velocity ( @xmath11),number of electrons ( @xmath12 ) , electron lifetime @xmath18 and charge yield observed for different electric fields ( @xmath19).[tab_qresults ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "measurements have been made of the response of a liquid xenon drift chamber to irradiation by 511  kev photons . using a model accounting for the sources of uncertainty in the energy resolution we also determined values for the intrinsic energy resolutions .",
    "figure  [ fig_eres ] summarizes the results for charge , light and combined energy resolution as a function of the drift field .",
    "the main error contribution to the combined energy resolution , apart from the solid angle fluctuations which can be eliminated by utilizing the position measurement , originated from the apd gain fluctuation and the anode noise . both were about of 2.7% .",
    "figure  [ fig_interes ] depicts the values for the intrinsic energy resolutions obtained by subtracting the detector contributions from the values in fig .",
    "[ fig_eres ] .",
    "the error bars given are statistical .    based on these results , the combined energy resolution of @xmath93.5% ( or @xmath20 fwhm )",
    "would be anticipated in a detector configuration suitable for applications to pet which would have comparable light collection efficiency to the prototype detector described above and @xmath91  mm spatial resolution .",
    "reducing the anode to grid spacing to 1  mm and the grid wire spacing to 1  mm will reduce the width of the pulses and minimize the dependence of the pulse shape on the location of the electron cloud .",
    "further improvements are foreseen in areas including purification and low noise electronics .",

    "we also thank e. aprile and e. conti for providing information about their work . this work was supported in part by the canada foundation for innovation , the university of british columbia , and triumf which receives federal funding via a contribution agreement through the national research council of canada ."
