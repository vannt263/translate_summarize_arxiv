    "the formation of molecules by feshbach resonance  @xcite and by two - photon raman photoassociation  @xcite from ultracold atomic gases trapped in an optical lattice potential offers remarkable opportunities to study some of the long - standing questions of condensed matter physics in systems under exquisite control , and is also of much interest for quantum information science  @xcite .",
    "external control parameters such as laser and magnetic field strengths can be controlled precisely in real time , allowing the experimental investigation of the dynamics of strongly correlated systems from the adiabatic to the sudden regime , the study of the formation of long - range order and defects as the system transits across quantum critical points , and the engineering of exotic many - body states starting from various quantum phases  @xcite .",
    "the creation of molecules from cold atoms in optical lattices has been demonstrated experimentally by several groups . applying two - photon raman lasers on @xmath0rb atoms in a 3-dimensional ( 3d ) lattice , t.  rom _ et al . _",

    "unfortunately , the molecular decay arising from the spontaneous emission induced by raman laser photons exceeded the photoassociation coupling , so that this experiment could not observe coherent rabi oscillations between atoms and molecules .",
    "the first lattice experiments exploiting the passage of fermions ( @xmath1k atoms ) across a feshbach resonance were performed by m.  k@xmath2hl _ et al . _",
    "they observed the occupation of atoms in higher bloch bands near the resonance , indicating that the inclusion of inter - band coupling is crucial for the description of a broad feshbach resonance in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "they also created feshbach molecules from fermionic atoms in a three - dimensional optical lattice  @xcite , and found that the measured binding energy of the molecules is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of single - channel models of atoms in a tight trap  @xcite .",
    "we also mention a recent experiment by g.  tialhammer _ et al . _",

    "generated a quantum degenerate gas of molecules via photoassociation of @xmath0rb atoms , and observed a clear coherent atom - molecule oscillation in an optical lattice , with rabi frequency @xmath5khz  @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the atoms were initially in the mott - insulator ( mi ) phase .",
    "for the duration of the photoassociation pulse each atom was trapped in the ground state of a single lattice site with trapping frequency @xmath6khz , and the atom - atom interaction strength and atomic intersite tunneling were of the order of @xmath7khz and @xmath8hz , respectively .",
    "in general , the initial atomic state in that experiment can be in either the mi or the superfluid ( sf ) phase , depending on the depth of the optical lattice .",
    "combined with the interplay between two - body interactions , intersite tunneling , and atom - molecule coupling , this results in the photoassociation process exhibiting a very rich dynamics .",
    "motivated by these experimental advances , this paper considers a gas of two - component fermionic atoms coupled to bosonic molecules via photoassociation in an optical lattice .",
    "the system consists initially of bosonic molecules only , assumed to be in a ground state corresponding to either a mi phase or a sf phase , and a cw photoassociation beam is switched on instantaneously at @xmath9 .",
    "our goal is to study the subsequent dissociation dynamics of the bosonic molecules into fermionic atoms .",
    "we examine the crossover of the dynamics from an independent single - site regime to a cooperative regime .",
    "we also show the appearance of two types of self - trapping transitions  @xcite , which we characterize as _ coherent _ and _ incoherent _ , as the ratio of repulsive molecule - molecule interaction strength to molecular tunneling is varied .",
    "section ii discusses our model and formulates it as a single - band resonantly coupled bose - fermi hubbard model .",
    "we show that in this model the dissociation dynamics can be described by a spin - boson lattice hamiltonian in terms of pseudo - spin formalism . in this section",
    "we also give a formulation of mean field approximation based on a generalized gutzwiller ( gw ) ansatz .",
    "section iii discusses the dissociation dynamics in several limiting cases .",

    "the fermionic atoms can be coherently combined into bosonic molecules of mass @xmath12 via two - photon raman photoassociation .",
    "the lattice lasers are adjusted in such a way that the tight binding approximation is well justified . since in lattice",
    "photoassociation experiments the atom - molecule interaction energy is typically small compared to the trapping energies of the atoms and molecules  @xcite ( note that this is not so for the broad feshbach resonance of @xmath1k atoms  @xcite ) the system can be described by the single - band resonantly coupled bose - fermi hubbard model  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 are annihilation operators for the fermionic atoms of spin @xmath17 and bosonic molecules at the @xmath18-th site , respectively .",

    "the on - site fermion - fermion , boson - boson , and boson - fermion collisions are described by the interaction strengths @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "finally , the term proportional to @xmath35 in @xmath26 describes the conversion of fermionic atoms into bosonic molecules , and vice versa , via photoassociation .",
    "we concentrate on the case where the system consists initially of bosonic molecules only , and the corresponding initial state is the ground state of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xmath25 .",
    "it is well - known that the ground state of this model describes either a mi phase or a sf phase , depending on the ratio @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a number of nearest neighbor sites , for a fixed number of bosons  @xcite .    in the following we consider a strongly confining regime @xmath38 . in this regime , fermi pair states , that is , pairs of fermions with spins up and down occupying the same site , see upper diagrams in fig .",

    "this allows us to treat the fermionic tunneling that couples the paired and unpaired states perturbatively .",
    "since in addition the photodissociation of a molecule always creates a fermi pair at a given lattice site , the unpaired states can then be adiabatically eliminated and integrated out .",
    "this results in the tunneling of fermi pairs via those virtual states ( fig .",
    "[ pairtunnel ] ) , and the hamiltonian @xmath24 is mapped on a pseudo - spin-1/2 system ( xxz model ) by second - order degenerate perturbation theory  @xcite , @xmath39 here @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and we have introduced the pseudo - spin operators describing the creation and annihilation of a fermi pair @xmath42 and @xmath43 at the @xmath18-th site  @xcite .",
    "this mapping amounts to describing fermionic pairs as `` effective two - level atoms '' whose upper level corresponds to a pair of fermions , and lower level the absence of such a pair .",
    "thus the presence of paired states at the @xmath18-th site is described by the spin - up state @xmath44 and its absence by the spin - down state @xmath45 .",
    "the pseudo - spin operators obey the commutation relations @xmath46=\\pm\\sp_{fi}^\\pm\\delta_{i , j},\\quad [ \\sp_{fi}^+,\\sp_{fj}^-]=2\\sp_{fi}^z\\delta_{i , j}.\\ ] ]    in terms of these operators the interaction hamiltonian @xmath26 can be re - expressed as @xmath47 we thus conclude that in the strongly confining regime the dissociation of initially bosonic molecular states into fermionic atoms is governed by the spin - boson lattice hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath48 this effective hamiltonian is valid for both of attractive and repulsive fermion - fermion interaction cases for the problem at hand .    .",

    "the time dependence of the system parameters was assumed to be slow enough that the system is allowed to evolve adiabatically .    in the present case ,",
    "the ground state of the bosonic molecules in the absence of photoassociation is given by the stationary solution of eq.([tdga ] ) with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "it is known that the trap frequencies of homonuclear molecules in a lattice site almost coincide with the atomic trap frequencies  @xcite , so that in general @xmath181 due to the higher mass of the molecules , @xmath12 . however ,",
    "if the inequality @xmath38 that underlies all of the considerations in this paper is fulfilled , the effective tunneling of the fermions is given by @xmath41 , which can then easily lead to a system of @xmath182 where the intersite spin - spin coupling does not affect the coherence properties of the dynamics . in the following we limit our considerations to this case",
    ", an additional self - trapping transition originating from the intersite spin - spin coupling can be found even for @xmath132 . ] .    in the regime of cooperative dynamics of fig .",
    "[ mfdpd ] , the spin - spin coupling gives rise to a positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) detuning effect for the case of attractive ( resp .",
    "repulsive ) fermion - fermion interaction , since a superfluid state of fermi pairs ( @xmath183 ) lowers , resp .",
    "raises the energy for @xmath184 , resp .",
    "this additional detuning can however be compensated by changing the photodissociation detuning energy @xmath186 .",
    "we have checked that finite values of @xmath137 preserve the appearance of the self - trapping transitions .",
    "finally , in the regime of incoherent dynamics the effects of the xxz term become weaker with decreasing @xmath140 .",
    "we thus conclude that the discussion in the preceding subsections holds even in the presence of the intersite spin - spin coupling .",
    "in this paper we have investigated theoretically the photodissociation of ground - state bosonic molecules into two - component fermionic atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "we showed that the dissociation dynamics in the strong fermion - fermion interaction limit , @xmath38 , is governed by a spin - boson lattice hamiltonian dynamics . using a gutzwiller mean - field analysis",
    ", we examined the crossover of the dissociation dynamics from an independent single - site regime to a cooperative regime as the molecular tunneling is increased .",
    "we also showed the appearance of two types of transitions , that is _ coherent _ and _ incoherent _ self - trapping transitions , as a small variation of @xmath36 . the mean - field approximation only accounts for those tunnel processes proportional to the expectation values of bosonic and fermionic pair operators .",
    "thus , when starting from the mi molecular phase the dynamics of the atoms and molecules inside the individual lattice sites always remains independent of the other sites .",
    "in this situation , genuine quantum effects are significant , and are closely related to the stability of the mi phase under boson - fermion conversion  @xcite and to the formation of sf correlations across the mi - sf critical point  @xcite .",
    "this will be discussed in a future publication .",
