    "the properties of quantum antiferromagnets in low dimensions have been intensely studied over the past decade and a half .",
    "much insight has been gained by large @xmath0 treatments based on generalizing the symmetry group from su(2 ) to either su(@xmath0 ) or sp(@xmath0 ) , especially in two dimensions where exact solutions are not available .",
    "these reformulations involve the representation of the spins by bilinears in fermionic or bosonic `` spinon '' operators at the cost of introducing local constraints on their number and an associated gauge invariance @xcite . at @xmath9",
    "the constraints are trivially solved and a purely quadratic problem results .",
    "most of this effort has gone into elucidating the zero temperature phase diagram and has also involved going beyond the @xmath9 limit by thinking about the structure of the gauge theory that results if the spinons are integrated out .",
    "an oddity from the early work using bosons is the report @xcite , on a square lattice , of a finite - temperature _ phase _ at @xmath9 with no intersite correlations  a perfect paramagnet . at low temperatures the energy cost compels spins to align ( in ferromagnets ) or antialign ( in antiferromagnets ) . in the language of schwinger bosons ,",
    "this is seen as a correlation or anticorrelation of boson flavors on adjacent sites . at higher temperatures ,",
    "free energy @xmath10 is dominated by entropy . when the number of boson flavors @xmath11 ( with the coupling constant appropriately rescaled @xmath12 ) , the entropy of the disordered state completely overpowers the energy cost , so that neighboring sites become _ perfectly _ uncorrelated above a certain temperature .",
    "( at large but finite @xmath0 the high - temperature phase has nonvanishing correlations . )",
    "such a phase must then be separated from the lower temperature paramagnetic state with finite intersite correlations by a phase transition .",
    "this phase transition clearly has no analog in the physical su@xmath4 problem and is therefore an embarrassment for the large-@xmath0 approach .",
    "solution of the kondo problem which exhibits truly non - analytic behavior at a finite temperature .",
    "there the exact bethe ansatz solutions were used to show that this happens only at infinite @xmath0 ; otherwise it is a crossover that sharpens continuously as @xmath0 is increased @xcite .",
    "] we have found that an essentially identical transition occurs in the su@xmath2 generalization of the heisenberg ferromagnet at @xmath9 .",
    "understanding its fate at finite @xmath0 is equally a matter of interest .    in this paper",
    "we investigate this transition in some detail . to make life simpler",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the su@xmath2 ferromagnet , although much of what we say should apply _ mutatis mutandis _ to the sp@xmath2 antiferromagnet .",
    "we make one further simplification , that of taking the large `` spin '' or boson density limit at any fixed @xmath0 , which renders the problem classical without destroying the transition of interest . for the classical su@xmath2 ferromagnet",
    ", we first examine the @xmath9 solution carefully and show that the transition is first order on the square lattice , a fact which will be crucial in the following .",
    "we analyze a number of other lattices and find that this is the outcome on all lattices that have a shortest closed loop of length three or four . on other lattices , such as the honeycomb or the linear chain , which lack such loops ,",
    "the transition is continuous .",
    "the order of the transition at @xmath9 is thus influenced by lattice connectivity and not dimensionality .",
    "however , life does become more interesting in @xmath13 where ferromagnetic states that break the su@xmath2 symmetry become stable to the mermin - wagner fluctuations contained in the @xmath9 theory .",
    "now it is possible for such states to `` piggy - back '' on the finitely correlated paramagnets and first order transitions between the perfect paramagnet and ferromagnetic states result in cases where the `` underlying transition '' is predicted to be first order `` enough '' . the corresponding transition in the sp@xmath2 antiferromagnet has been found recently by desilva and co - workers @xcite .",
    "we turn next to the survival of this transition at finite values of @xmath0 .",
    "we offer strong evidence for the following conclusions .",
    "+ ( a ) in @xmath14 it goes away , as it must on general grounds .",
    "+ ( b ) in @xmath15 the first order transitions survive for sufficiently large values of @xmath0 but terminate at an ising critical endpoint ; the critical value @xmath16 is likely too large to be seen in feasible simulations .",
    "+ ( c ) in @xmath17 and above the first order transitions again survive . in cases where they are preempted by first order transitions to the ferromagnetic state at @xmath9 the latter transition again survives at large @xmath0 and presumably turns continuous before the su@xmath4 limit is reached .",
    "+ ( d ) in cases where the transition is continuous _ at _ @xmath9 , we conclude that the transition goes away at finite @xmath0 .",
    "the classical su@xmath2 model we study has a pre - history for it is a lattice version of the cp@xmath3 model .",
    "previous workers , most notably sokal and starinets @xcite , have concluded that the transition in the lattice model is an artefact of @xmath9 in _ all _ dimensions .",
    "their arguments are based on an exact solution of the @xmath14 problem , a violation of gauge invariance at @xmath9 and the apparent lack of such a transition at small @xmath0 in simulations . in a companion paper to ours , fendley and one of us ( ot ) have independently solved the @xmath14 case and so we are in agreement with sokal and starinets on that .",
    "we will argue below that the breakdown of gauge invariance is misleading and in the course of this argument we will appeal to a similar breakdown in an ising gauge reformulation of the @xmath5 state potts model that exhibits a phase transition with a family resemblance to the ones at issue and where one can appeal to well - established results .",
    "we will argue that the transition at issue has the character of a liquid - gas transition in that the two phases can be smoothly continued into one another .",
    "the two paramagnetic phases have different energy densities ; the difference varies with @xmath0 and vanishes at some critical value @xmath16 .",
    "finally , we will compute the dimensionless surface tension at coexistence for the infinite-@xmath0 problem and show that it is small and thereby conclude that the transition terminates at rather large values of @xmath0 , consistent with the failure to observe it in simulations .    in the balance of this section",
    "we introduce the quantum and classical hamiltonians of interest . in section [ section - infiniten ] we carry out a saddle point analysis at @xmath9 . in section [ section - finiten ]",
    "we consider the finite ( but large ) @xmath0 problem .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section [ section - conclusion ] .",

    "has been gained from considering the mean field theory that results in the @xmath28 limit taken while keeping @xmath29 fixed .",
    "however this limit also exhibits a finite temperature phase transition between two paramagnetic phases , first discussed for the su@xmath2 case by arovas and auerbach @xcite .    to study this transition in more detail , we will study an easier limit , that of @xmath30 at finite temperatures . with appropriately rescaled variables and units such that @xmath31 this yields a classical partition function governed , in the su@xmath2 case , by the classical energy @xmath32 defined in terms of a complex @xmath0-vector @xmath33 obeying @xmath34 .",

    "the vector @xmath38 takes values on a complex sphere @xmath39 , which as a manifold is identical to the real @xmath40-sphere @xmath41 .",
    "however , the @xmath42 gauge symmetry can be used to effectively reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the problem by 1 by an appropriate choice of gauge .",
    "thus @xmath33 takes values on the manifold @xmath43 which is better known as the complex projective space @xmath44 .",
    "alternatively we can carry the gauge invariance along since it involves a compact gauge field and hence only contributes a finite multiplicative factor in finite volumes .    a similar limit yields the classical sp@xmath2 problem with energy @xmath45",

    "as noted at the outset , our class of problems exhibit a local gauge invariance . in our @xmath9 analysis we picked a gauge to identify a saddle point and left open the option of not picking a gauge and simply adding in all the gauge equivalent saddle points .",
    "while this would appear to be a manifestly gauge invariant way of proceeding , it hides an interesting anomaly noted most recently by sokal and starinets @xcite : the local u(1 ) gauge symmetry appears to be spontaneously broken in the low - temperature phase if one invokes the usual criterion of a response to an infinitesimal field taken to zero post - thermodynamic limit",
    ". has been investigated by several authors @xcite ] .",
    "so this answers our first question : there _ is _ a broken symmetry at @xmath9 but it can not be broken at any finite @xmath0 by virtue of elitzur s theorem @xcite .",
    "sokal and starinets go further and use this observation to conclude that `` it seems unlikely that such a transition can survive to finite @xmath0 . ''",
    "we show in the following , by a simpler example , that this is a red herring and that at least in the case of a first order transition there is no contradiction between the restoration of elitzur s theorem and the survival of the transition .",
    "the example involves the potts model , which we will rewrite as an ising gauge theory .",
    "this will enable us to appeal to well known results on the potts model to establish the phase diagram of the theory .",
    "altogether we will see the breakdown of gauge invariance is a consequence of something special ",
    "the divergence between the exchange constant and the transition temperature in the infinite @xmath0 limit .",
    "first let us note the violation of elitzur s theorem explicitly .",
    "the gauge symmetry in question is evident from the form of energy ( [ eq - e - classical ] ) . changing the phase of the oscillator variable @xmath176 leaves the energy invariant .",
    "however , the link variable @xmath177 is certainly not invariant : @xmath178 .",
    "thus the absolute phases of @xmath48 are immaterial . in particular , changing the sign of all link variables ( on a bipartite lattice ! ) gives a physically equivalent configuration .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown that adding an infinitesimal gauge - fixing term to the energy , @xmath179 , \\label{eq - e - eta}\\ ] ] leads to a non - analytic behavior of the free energy near @xmath180 : @xmath181}{n } = \\frac{f[q,\\mu,0]}{n }   - 2|\\eta| \\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle }   |q_{ij}| + \\mathcal o(\\eta^2 ) .",
    "\\label{eq - f - eta}\\ ] ] ( the limit @xmath11 should be taken first to ensure validity of the mean - field treatment . )",
    "the nonalyticity of the free energy ( [ eq - f - eta ] ) means that the values of @xmath48 are frozen either near @xmath182 or @xmath183 , depending on the sign of @xmath184 .",
    "thus the local u(1 ) gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken in a phase with @xmath185 .",
    "why is a gauge symmetry spontaneously broken at large @xmath0 ?",
    "what happens when the number of flavors is large but finite ? to answer these questions , one could study thermodynamics of an su(@xmath0 ) ferromagnet in the presence of a small symmetry - breaking term ( [ eq - e - eta ] ) .",
    "the partition function of an infinite chain ( or just of a single link ) can be evaluated for any finite @xmath0 using the transfer matrix : @xmath186^{1/l } = 2(n-1 ) \\int_0^{\\pi/2 } \\sin^{2n-3}{\\theta}\\ , \\cos{\\theta}\\ , d\\theta \\ { \\rm e}^{n\\beta(\\cos^2{\\theta}-\\eta\\cos{\\theta } ) } \\label{eq - z - eta}\\ ] ] ( see the companion paper @xcite for details on the integration measure ) .",
    "evaluation of the partition function ( [ eq - z - eta ] ) is a feasible , though not particularly straightforward task . to keep technical details to a minimum",
    ", we have chosen to study a similar phenomenon in the potts model . because it involves discrete degrees of freedom , the broken gauge symmetry is also discrete ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "we define the potts model @xcite in terms of unit vectors @xmath188 that can point along orthogonal axes in a @xmath5-dimensional internal space : the energy is @xmath189 we have doubled the number of states per site compared to the usual amount . as a result , the energy is invariant under a local @xmath187 symmetry @xmath190 .",
    "apart from a multiplicative factor , the partition function is identical to that of the potts model .",
    "parametrization ( [ eq - potts - z2 ] ) is a discrete analogue of representing su(@xmath0 ) spins in terms of schwinger bosons ( [ eq - e - classical ] ) .",
    "we can construct an infinite @xmath5 treatment along the same lines as the large @xmath0 treatment discussed previously : we decouple the quartic interaction in favour of a gauge field : @xmath191 and then integrate the spins out .",
    "the result of this analysis is the prediction of a finite temperature first order phase transition from a phase with zero correlation length as the temperature is lowered . again",
    "the infinite @xmath5 system breaks the ising gauge invariance .",
    "now we know that for any finite @xmath5 , the potts model has a phase transition in @xmath15 or more but not in @xmath14 and that the transition is indeed first order at large @xmath5 in @xmath192 dimensions .",
    "dimensions , the discrete global symmetry of the potts model can be spontaneously broken . in order to characterize a ferromagnetic phase",
    ", one must introduce an appropriate order parameter .",
    "this complication is absent in the su@xmath2 model in @xmath15 in view of the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "] we also know that the finite @xmath5 problem can not break gauge invariance",
    ". evidently the prediction of a first order transition in a dimension where it has every reason to be robust , is _ not _ vitiated by the breaking of local gauge invariance .",
    "indeed one can use this example to see where the breaking comes from .",
    "consider for simplicity the one dimensional chain .",
    "the free energy density of an infinite chain can be evaluated with the aid of the transfer matrix yielding @xmath193 this is an analytic function of @xmath147 for any finite @xmath5 . at large @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath194 in the limit @xmath195 , the free energy develops a kink at @xmath196 , so that there is a first - order phase transition .",
    "the @xmath187 gauge symmetry is broken in the low - temperature phase ( @xmath197 ) . to see this , add a symmetry - breaking term @xmath198 to the energy of every bond and evaluate the free energy in its presence : @xmath199 the expectation value of the gauge - dependent quantity @xmath200 ( the analogue of @xmath201 ) depends on the order of limits @xmath202 and @xmath195 : @xmath203 if the limit @xmath202 is taken first ( at finite @xmath5 ) , the gauge symmetry remains intact . reversing the order of limits ( @xmath195 first ) leads to spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry .",
    "what have we learned from the potts model ?",
    "gauge symmetry can be spoiled by adding a term that prefers one gauge configuration over all others .",
    "the symmetry is spontaneously broken if gauge selection reliably occurs even when the gauge - fixing term is small .",
    "the example we have just worked out shows that the there may be different degrees of smallness : the symmetry - breaking perturbation can be compared to the interaction strength , as well as to temperature .",
    "the presence of a large number of flavors in the model pushes the temperature scale down ( as @xmath6 in the schwinger - boson case or as @xmath204 in the potts model ) .",
    "thus a nominally small gauge - fixing term ( @xmath205 ) can still be large enough ( @xmath206 ) to pick out a gauge .",
    "most importantly , this does not rule out a persistence of the transition when @xmath5 is finite , contradicting the belief of sokal and starinets .",
    "the next order of business is to ask whether a gauge - invariant order parameter can discriminate between the putative finite @xmath0 versions of the two phases .",
    "note that both are @xmath35 invariant . in our discussion of @xmath207",
    "later we will briefly consider the new features that arise when that can be broken as well .",
    "away from infinite @xmath0 , @xmath208 by gauge invariance while the amplitude @xmath209 will be non - zero in both phases although it could jump across the transition . at any rate it can not serve as an order parameter .",
    "this leaves the gauge invariant fluxes that remain when the fluctuations of the amplitude are integrated out . in @xmath14",
    "this sector is empty . in higher dimensions",
    "these would be described , at large @xmath0 , by a weakly coupled @xmath42 gauge theory .",
    "while the coupling may jump across the phase boundary , at sufficiently large @xmath0 is will be small on either side and we expect that the gauge fluctuations will be in the same phase on either side , i.e. barely confining in @xmath210 while deconfining in @xmath211 . in any event",
    "we do not expect a qualitative distinction to develop between the two phases and hence the transition between them will have the character of a liquid - gas transition , and not an order - disorder transition . for this reason , we expect the transition to be generically first order if it exists . a qualitative distinction",
    "_ could _ develop at smaller @xmath0 in @xmath207 with a change in the character of the transition .",
    "we will briefly return to this later in our comments on @xmath207 .",
    "an important comment is in order . from the perspective of the original quantum magnetic problem ,",
    "we are operating at high temperatures and large `` spins '' . in this limit",
    "the temporal dimension has shrunk to zero and so we are computing wilson loops which are not really diagnostic of the free energy cost of separating two spinons .",
    "the latter requires a computation of the temporal polyakov loops and shows deconfinement consistent with the notion that the paramagnet is insensitive to the insertion or removal of a local fixed spin .",
    "finite lattices and lattices in @xmath14 dimensions simply can not have a phase transition when interactions are short ranged and @xmath0 is finite .",
    "an infinite @xmath0 , in essence , provides an extra dimension with a long - range interaction [ every flavor interacts with every other one , see eq .",
    "( [ eq - h - quantum1 ] ) ] which allows this conclusion to be evaded .",
    "thus in @xmath212 the transition will smooth into a crossover near @xmath76 .",
    "an explicit solution of the one - dimensional su@xmath2 and sp@xmath2 chains in the companion paper by fendley and tchernyshyov @xcite confirms this ; we direct the reader there for details of their method .    here",
    "we content ourselves with following the smearing of the infinite-@xmath0 transition into a crossover in the case of a single link .",
    "the effective free energy in this case is @xmath213\\ ] ] as a function of @xmath214 and @xmath215 , it has a saddle point for real and positive @xmath216 integrating out gaussian fluctuations of @xmath61 gives a nonsingular contribution of order 1 to the free energy of the link : @xmath217 this free energy has a minimum at @xmath70 if @xmath107 ; otherwise , the minimum is at @xmath218 . for large @xmath0 and @xmath173 near 1",
    ", the partition function evaluates to @xmath219 as temperature crosses 1 , energy of the link smoothly changes from being @xmath220 to being @xmath221 : @xmath222 the width of the crossover is @xmath223 . as @xmath11 , the crossover turns into a phase transition .",
    "this is the most interesting case for our purposes .",
    "for one thing , the application of large @xmath0 methods has been most influential with respect to ground state properties in @xmath15 . for another",
    ", the finite temperature problem can not break the su@xmath2 symmetry in @xmath15 by mermin - wagner and so the intra - paramagnetic liquid - gas transition we have been considering is the only possibility for a thermal transition .      in these cases ,",
    "e.g. the square and triangular lattices , the transition should survive at sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "briefly , the infinite @xmath0 transition involves the crossing of two separated saddle points . at large @xmath0",
    "we expect corrections to the contributions from the saddle points which are subdominant in @xmath0 but these should not affect the existence of a crossing .",
    "the only way this can go wrong is if a whole host of other saddle points enter the finite @xmath0 computation and their entropy overcomes the energy cost .",
    "this is what happens in @xmath14 where the other saddle points are domains walls ( instantons ) that turn the first order transition into a cross - over .",
    "( one can produce a first order transition in the infinte-@xmath0 problem in @xmath14 by adding a second neighbor coupling . )    in @xmath15 , as long as there is a finite surface tension per flavor between the two phases at @xmath9 , any domain walls of order the system size should be exponentially suppressed and hence the phase transition should survive at sufficiently large @xmath0 . as one of the two phases has zero correlation length ,",
    "we have carried out this computation to see if the magnitude of the surface tension is anomalously small .",
    "the computation is carried out by solving numerically the set of mean - field equations ( [ eq - mf - h ] ) and ( [ eq - mf - equip ] ) on an @xmath224 square or triangular lattice at the coexistence temperature of an infinite system .",
    "we have used periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a starting configuration includes two domains ( liquid and gas ) separated by two domain walls of total length @xmath225 .",
    "the free energy per unit length of the domain wall is fit to a simple form @xmath226 the second term , a finite - size effect , contains the spinon correlation length @xmath227 determined in the uniform liquid state leaving only two fitting parameters , interface tension @xmath7 and @xmath228 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - tension ] ) .",
    "for the square lattice this procedure yields a surface tension @xmath229 per flavor per lattice constant and an interface of width @xmath230 lattice constants . for the triangular lattice",
    "this yields a surface tension @xmath231 per flavor per lattice constant and an interface of width @xmath232 lattice constants .",
    "the surface tension is higher on a triangular lattice as expected since the first order transition is stronger in this case at @xmath9 .    as the surface tension is finite ,",
    "we conclude that immediately away from @xmath9 both phases will get dressed by local fluctuations , whose detailed theory at large @xmath0 is beyond our means at this point , but the transition will survive . we expect that the resulting line of first order transitions in the @xmath233 plane will terminate , as in the liquid - gas problem , in a critical end point governed by the @xmath15 ising critical theory .",
    "are discontinuous across the transition and thus play the role of an `` order parameter '' .",
    "] of course , the location of this critical end point will be non - universal and is unlikely to lie at an integer value of @xmath0 .",
    "in all of this , in a rough sense , valid near @xmath9 , the temperature ( or , rather , @xmath234 ) plays the role of the field that discriminates between the two phases , by favoring the gas or liquid saddle point ; while @xmath0 itself is an overall multiplicative factor in the free energy ( [ eq - mf - free - energy - diff ] ) , and therefore it acts as the inverse temperature .",
    "indeed , infinite @xmath0 corresponds to zero temperature in suppressing all fluctuations and making phase transitions possible even for finite lattices .",
    "as the computed dimensionless surface tension for the square lattice comes out substantially smaller than 1 , we suspect that the critical end point is not too far off and that one would need to go to very large @xmath0 to see the first order transition .",
    "a precise estimate would require a theory of the fluctuations , which we do not have in hand at this point .",
    "our computation on the triangular lattice suggests that one may be better off trying there .",
    "of course in neither case does the phase transition survive to @xmath235 where one knows from studies of the heisenberg model that it is nt there .",
    "( we believe that a similar estimate for the related rp@xmath3 problem will explain the failure of sokal and collaborators to observe a first order transition in simulations for @xmath0 as large as 8 . )      in these cases we conclude that the transition exists _ only _ at @xmath9 . essentially , this situation is the limiting case of the one in the previous section where the magnitude of the first order jump at @xmath9 has gone to zero and",
    "hence the critical end point has been displaced all the way to @xmath9 .",
    "the important caveat is that this limit is singular as far as the properties of the critical point are concerned .",
    "the `` critical point '' _ at _ @xmath9 has no fluctuations and has zero correlation length . at large @xmath0",
    "there is a `` boundary layer '' where the correlation length interpolates between a small microscopic value and infinity .",
    "starting with @xmath17 it becomes possible to break the @xmath35 symmetry .",
    "a cursory examination of the @xmath9 theory shows that cases in which the comparison of the paramagnetic solutions suggests a large jump in @xmath236 end up going directly between the seriously disordered paramagnet and the `` ferromagnet '' in which su@xmath2 is broken . consequently the transition survives when @xmath0 is reduced and one expects that this line of first order transitions turns into a line of continuous transitions by the time the known su(2 ) cases are reached .",
    "the other new possibility , in @xmath237 is that the inter - paramagnetic transition survives for a range of @xmath0 and then terminates in a line of confinement / deconfinement transitions .",
    "deciding whether this is likely is beyond the methods used in this paper and of academic interest in the study of quantum magnets .",
    "in the foregoing analysis we have established that the infinite @xmath0 transition between two paramagnetic phases is _ not _ generically , an artefact of that limit . it _ is _ however a delicate transition , since it relies on a large entropy from the number of flavors overpowering the energetics .",
    "consequently , as illustrated by our surface tension computation , we do not expect it to survive to small values of @xmath0 .",
    "as such , while there is no contradiction between its existence at large @xmath0 and the failure to observe it at values of @xmath0 accesible by other methods , it does mean that the large @xmath0 finite temperature phase diagram is not a reliable guide to the su@xmath4 case  which assumption is the basis of large-@xmath0 treatments .",
    "the same is true in higher dimensional cases where the infinite @xmath0 transition is to the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "we have also shown that the violation of elitzur s theorem at infinite @xmath0 is a consequence of a divergence between the exchange constant and the transition temperature and does not , in itself , invalidate the infinite @xmath0 analysis .",
