    "the large area telescope on the _ fermi _  gamma - ray observatory has detected numerous young pulsars , as well as recycled millisecond pulsars ( msps ) in close binary systems .",
    "most prominent of the new discoveries are the black widow ( bw ) pulsars and so - called `` redback '' systems @xcite , which comprise a large fraction of the msps selected by _ fermi_. the bws are msps with sub - stellar mass , degenerate companions , while the redbacks generally have @xmath3 evolved companions .",
    "the latter are usually close to filling their roche - lobes , which makes them a direct link to the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) progenitors of msps .",
    "recently , three redbacks have been observed to transition between radio pulsar and accreting states on timescales of years : psr j1023 + 0038 @xcite , xss j12270@xmath04859  @xcite , and psr j1824@xmath02452i in the globular cluster m28 @xcite .",
    "all of these are hard x - ray and/or @xmath1-ray sources .",
    "psr j1023 + 0038 was initially misclassified as a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) ( @xcite , but see @xcite for a contrary interpretation ) , as was xss j12270@xmath04859  @xcite , because of the similarity of their optical emission - line spectra and luminosities to those of cvs .",
    "now we know that transitional msps are distinguishable from cvs by their x - ray and optical light curves , which show characteristic dips and flares that are unique to this class @xcite .",
    "we employed this test to reevaluate two all - sky survey x - ray sources in _ fermi _  error circles that were spectroscopically classified as cvs by @xcite . using x - ray and optical time - series data for one of these , 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820/3fgl j1544.6@xmath01125",

    "it revealed an optical counterpart for this source that is slowly varying by @xmath129  magnitude , and has a bright maximum coincident with the x - ray flare , as shown in figures  [ fig : xmm_light_curve_1 ] and [ fig : om_images ] .",

    "mdm 1.3 m images from 2015 february 17 and 18 are the only ones that cover this source . because of its faintness and the short individual exposure times , we binned the images in groups of 10 .",
    "due to weather , only the 2015 february 18 observation yields a useful light curve ( figure  [ fig : optbin ] ) .",
    "it shows a broad minimum that is characteristic of the heating light curve of a bw companion to an msp .",
    "the x - ray and optical behavior of xmmu j083850.38@xmath0282756.8  is similar to that of bw pulsar binaries identified with _",
    "fermi _  sources , such as psr j1311@xmath03430 , which has both optical and x - ray flares @xcite .",
    "while there is only one broad minimum during the 5.4  hr span of the data , this is not necessarily a lower limit on the orbital period because of the possibility of flaring , which may mask a second dip near the end of the time series .",
    "a third x - ray source on the pn ccd , xmmu j083842.85@xmath0282831.8 , labeled `` c '' in the images of figure  [ fig : finder ] , falls within the error circle of 3fgl j0838.8@xmath02829 .",
    "its @xmath130 power - law x - ray spectrum and relatively steady optical flux in the om and mdm 1.3 m time series ( figure  [ fig : optbin ] ) suggest that it is a qso .",

    "this object was also listed as a low - probability blazar candidate for 3fgl j0838.8@xmath02829by @xcite , from its colors in the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ data .",
    "lacking a radio detection in the nvss , it is unlikely to be a blazar .",
    "we obtained an optical spectrum of xmmu j083842.85@xmath0282831.8  using the ohio state multi - object spectrograph ( osmos ) on the mdm 2.4 m telescope . in the wavelength range 39606880",
    "  it shows a single broad emission line , which we identify as @xmath134 at @xmath135 , with an equivalent width of @xmath136    ( figure  [ fig : qsospec ] ) .",
    "this confirms that it is a non - blazar agn , and probably unrelated to the _ fermi _  source .",
    "the x - ray light curve of 1rxs j083842.1@xmath0282723 , with its deep , broad dips at a period of , is typical of those polars in which self occultation of the emitting magnetic pole by the wd is responsible for the modulation .",
    "it can not be an eclipse by the orbiting secondary star or the accretion stream , because either of those would be much narrower .",
    "eclipse ingress or egress of the entire wd would take only a few seconds , less than one bin of the light curves , based on the orbital velocities estimated below",
    ". the eclipse duration would be @xmath137 cycles given the radius of the secondary star .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for a light curve of an eclipsing polar .",
    "the slower but equally deep 14.7  hr modulation requires yet another explanation .",
    "it also is too broad to be an eclipse by the orbiting secondary or accretion stream .",
    "the hardness ratio does not indicate photoelectric absorption as a cause .",
    "instead , we hypothesize that the long period results from interruption of the accretion stream due to an orbit that is asynchronous with respect to the wd rotation . this modulates the accretion rate onto the wd with a 14.7  hr period .",
    "in addition , the spin cycle is thrown out of phase by @xmath2 at the minimum of the 14.7  hr modulation .",
    "this is interpreted as switching of the accretion between not quite antipodal regions , when the accretion almost stops .",
    "the effect on the power spectrum is exactly analogous to amplitude modulation of a carrier signal , with a phase jump , which splits the signal into two periods straddling the true one .",
    "we have recovered the true period , which we interpret as the wd spin , in the three x - ray observations reported here .",
    "there is no direct manifestation of the orbit in the power spectrum , but the 14.7  hr period most likely represents the time it takes for the companion star to migrate @xmath2 around the wd , i.e. , one - third of the beat period of the spin and the orbit .",
    "the implied orbital period is , assuming that it is longer than the spin period .",
    "the emission - line radial velocity curve has a period of , which is consistent with the x - ray inferred orbital period , and not with the spin .",
    "but the radial velocity amplitude of 274  km  s@xmath8 is too large to be an orbital velocity of the wd , and the lines are too broad , @xmath138  km  s@xmath8 to be coming from the heated face of the secondary star .",
    "a typical cv with orbital period of 100 minutes has a @xmath139 wd and a @xmath140 secondary @xcite .",
    "typical orbital velocities are then @xmath141  km  s@xmath8 for the wd and @xmath142  km  s@xmath8 for the secondary . on the other hand ,",
    "free - fall velocity onto the wd is up to 3900  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "so we conclude that the emission lines are located high in the accretion column .",
    "we also examined the ew of the h@xmath10 emission line as a function of spectroscopic phase .",
    "the ew varies @xmath94 cycles out of phase with respect to the radial velocity ( figure  [ fig : specfold ] ) .",
    "the ew is therefore greatest at the point of maximum blueshift , phase 0.75 . assuming radial accretion , this is when the accreting pole is on the far side of the wd and maximally occulted",
    ". the emission - line source could be higher up in the accretion column than the optical continuum source , and therefore less modulated .",
    "this would result in a larger ew at phase 0.75 , where the continuum is weakest .",
    "the original group of four asynchronous polars have spin and orbit periods which periods differ by @xmath143 ( @xcite , and references therein ) . in 1rxs j083842.1@xmath0282723 ,",
    "the difference we infer is @xmath144 .",
    "a fifth asynchronous polar has been proposed to explain the post - nova light curve of v4633  sgr @xcite , which had transient period that decreased from 185.6 minutes to 183.9 minutes in addition to a stable period of 180.8 minutes .",
    "the authors attributed the longer period to the spin period , which was perturbed by the outburst , while the shorter period is orbital .",
    "it is generally observed that asynchronous polars are evolving toward synchronization on a short time scale , which suggests that nova eruptions may be the cause of all asynchronous polars .    other cvs with more complex light curves and multiple periods",
    "have also been proposed as extreme asynchronous polars , most notably rx j0524 + 42 , dubbed `` paloma '' @xcite , and igr  j19552 + 0044 @xcite .",
    "paloma is suggested to have an orbital period of 157 minutes , and a spin period that is either 136 or 146 minutes , which are asynchronous by 14% or 7% respectively @xcite .",
    "igr  j19552 + 0044 has a spectroscopic period of 1.39  hr that disagrees with its photometric period of 1.36  hr @xcite , while @xcite finds x - ray periods of 1.38  hr and 1.69  hr . for these systems with highly discrepant periods",
    ", it is not yet known if they are evolving toward synchronization , but if so , it may be for the first time . among this group ,",
    "1rxs j083842.1@xmath0282723  has the simplest light curve and power spectrum , and thus may be a key to interpreting the other , more complex cases .",
    "none of the properties of the cv 1rxs j083842.1@xmath0282723  suggest a connection with 3fgl j0838.8@xmath02829 . using machine learning algorithms , @xcite classified 3fgl j0838.8@xmath02829  as a high - confidence pulsar based on its @xmath1-ray spectral shape and variability index .",
    "accordingly , we propose xmmu j083850.38@xmath0282756.8  as the millisecond pulsar counterpart of 3fgl j0838.8@xmath02829 .",
    "x - ray properties of bw pulsars were reviewed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they have hard power - law spectra and sometimes a soft thermal component from the neutron star surface .",
    "the non - thermal emission is thought to be synchrotron from an intrabinary shock between the pulsar wind and the companion stellar wind . in some cases",
    "the x - ray flux is modulated on the orbital period , due either to relativistic beaming , or self occultation of the emitting region near the surface of the companion star @xcite .",
    "the optical light curves of bws are modulated by photospheric heating .",
    "usually the heated face of the substellar companion is much brighter than the cool photosphere on the `` night '' side . in some cases ,",
    "the heating light curve is not symmetric with respect to the line between the stars , which could be due to an asymmetric shock , or to channeling of the pulsar wind by intrinsic magnetic fields on the companion @xcite . in psr j1311@xmath03430",
    ", bright flares have been seen in optical and x - rays @xcite , which could be coming from the companion s magnetic fields .",
    "psr j1311@xmath03430 is a short - period ( 94 minute ) system , which , being in tidally locked rapid rotation , could enhance the coronal magnetic field @xcite .    the hard x - ray power - law spectrum and x - ray and optical flare seen in the  observation of xmmu j083850.38@xmath0282756.8  strongly",
    "motivate its identification as the msp counterpart of 3fgl j0838.8@xmath02829 .",
    "msps are at distances of @xmath129  kpc .",
    "if so , its x - ray luminosity would be @xmath145 erg  s@xmath8 , in the range of both bws and redbacks in the radio pulsar state @xcite .",
    "in contrast , accreting redbacks have @xmath146 erg  s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this would be the first time that a simultaneous x - ray and optical flare is seen from a bw .",
    "it may be a short - period system similar to psr j1311@xmath03430 , but the x - ray light curve does nt reveal an orbital period .",
    "any orbital modulation in the 0.510  hr period range has @xmath147% amplitude for an assumed sinusoid .",
    "the cadence of the 4400  s om exposures is too long to test for such a period , which may , in addition , be masked by the flaring behavior .",
    "the mdm optical data , on the other had , have adequate cadence , and a dip that is characteristic of a heating light curve , but the dip does not repeat within the 5.4  hr time series ( figure  [ fig : optbin ] ) , which suggests that the period is @xmath148  hr .",
    "alternatively , a second dip may be masked by a flaring episode .",
    "bw optical light curves are usually modulated by several magnitudes , while the dip in xmmu j083850.38@xmath0282756.8  is only @xmath149 magnitudes .",
    "this could mean that the inclination angle of the binary is small , or that the companion is a low - mass main sequence star , i.e. , a redback , which is brighter than a bw .",
    "optical flares have also been seen from the redback psr j1048 + 2339 @xcite .",
    "additional time - series photometry , optical spectroscopy , and a radio or @xmath1-ray pulsar detection , could confirm the identification , and resolve the remaining questions about the basic parameters of the binary system .",
    "the @xmath1-ray properties of 3fgl j0838.8@xmath02829  have suggested that it is a pulsar . in this x - ray and optical study , we first concluded that 1rxs j083842.1@xmath0282723 , the brightest x - ray source in its error circle , is an unusual cv that falls there by chance .",
    "it has a simple x - ray light curve that is strongly modulated at two periods , with a phase jump that indicates pole - switching of the accretion in an asynchronous polar .",
    "the spin is manifest as a 94.8 minute x - ray period caused by self occultation of the accreting pole , while the switching interval is 14.7  hours .",
    "this implies an orbital period of 98.3 minutes , consistent with the 98.41 minute optical spectroscopic period .",
    "the strong optical and x - ray modulation on the 14.7  hr period can be explained by nearly complete interruption of the accretion stream as it switches poles .",
    "a dedicated optical monitoring campaign could obtain a more precise value for the beat period , test the proposed geometry of the accretion spots in more detail , and determine whether the spin and orbit are evolving toward synchronism .",
    "x - ray and optical observations identify a second , highly variable object in the error circle of 3fgl j0838.8@xmath02829 .",
    "xmmu j083850.38@xmath0282756.8  is modulated on a time scale of hours in the optical , in addition to having shown one simultaneous x - ray and optical flare .",
    "it has a hard , nonthermal x - ray spectrum .",
    "these properties are compatible with black widow or redback millisecond pulsar systems that have been discovered as counterparts of _ fermi _  sources . a binary period ,",
    "an important test of this hypothesis , is not yet revealed by the available data , but follow - up time - series photometry , optical spectroscopy , and/or a radio pulsar detection , should be able to determine the orbital parameters of the system .",
