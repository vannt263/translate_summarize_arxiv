    "* *  * * quantum teleportation has found important applications for realization of various quantum technologies @xcite .",
    "teleportation of quantum states has been demonstrated between light beams @xcite , trapped atoms @xcite , superconducting qubits @xcite , defect spins in solids @xcite , and from light beams to atoms @xcite or solid state spin qubits @xcite .",
    "it is of both fundamental interest and practical importance to push quantum teleportation towards more macroscopic objects . * *  * * observing quantum phenomenon in macroscopic objects is a big challenge as their strong coupling to the environment causes fast decoherence which quickly pushes them to the classical world .",
    "for example , quantum coherence is hard to survive in mechanical vibration of macroscopic solids , which involves collective motion of a large number of strongly interacting atoms . despite this challenge ,",
    "achieving quantum control for the optomechanical systems becomes a recent focus of interest with remarkable progress * * @xcite**. this is driven in part by the fundamental interest and in part by the potential applications of these systems for quantum signal transduction * * @xcite * * , sensing * * @xcite * * , and quantum information processing * * @xcite**. there are typically two routes to achieve quantum control for the optomechanical systems : one needs to either identify some isolated degrees of freedom in mechanical vibrations and cool them to very low temperature to minimize their environmental coupling * * @xcite * * , or use the ultrafast laser technology to fast process and detect quantum coherence in such systems * * @xcite**. a remarkable example for the latter approach is provided by the optomechanical control in macroscopic diamond samples * * @xcite * * , where the motions of two separated diamonds have been cast into a quantum entangled state * * @xcite**.    in this paper , we report an experimental demonstration of quantum teleportation from light beams to the vibrational states of a macroscopic diamond sample of @xmath2 mm@xmath3 in size under ambient conditions .",
    "the vibration states are carried by two optical phonon modes , representing collective oscillation of over @xmath4 carbon atoms .",
    "to facilitate convenient qubit operations , we use the dual - rail representation of qubits instead of the single - rail encoding used in previous experiments * * @xcite * * and generate entanglement between the paths of a photon and different oscillation patterns of the diamond represented by two phononic modes . using quantum state tomography",
    ", we demonstrate entanglement fidelity of @xmath5 with the raw data and of @xmath6 after the background noise subtraction . using this entanglement",
    ", we prepare arbitrary polarization states for the photon and teleport these polarization states to the phonon modes with the bell measurements on the polarization and the path qubits carried by the same photon .",
    "the teleportation is verified by quantum process tomography , and we achieve a high average teleportation fidelity , about @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) after ( or before ) subtraction of the background noise . to verify the phonon s state before its fast decay , our implementation of teleportation adopted the technique of reversed time ordering introduced in ref . * * @xcite * * where the phonon s state is read out before the teleportation is completed .",
    "similar to the pioneering teleportation experiment of photons @xcite , our implementation of teleportation is conditional as the bell measurements are not deterministic and require postselecting of successful measurement outcomes .",
    "and generates a stokes photon in the forward direction and an excitation in the optical phonon mode of the diamond ( denoted by the state @xmath9 ) .",
    "the optical phonon mode corresponds to relative oscillation of the atoms in each unit cell of the diamond lattice , as illustrated by the figure on the right side . a read beam after a controllable delay converts the phonon excitation to an anti - stokes photon which can be used for state readout .",
    "the corresponding wavelengths and frequencies are shown in the figure .",
    "the state @xmath10 denotes the electron conduction band which is far detuned from the optical excitation . *",
    "b * , a scheme for generation of entanglement between a phonon in the diamond and a propagating photon .",
    "the phonon state is represented by a superposition of different oscillation modes of the diamond , while the photon state is represented by its spatial modes .",
    "* c * , readout of the phonon state with the read beams by coherently converting the phonon modes into the corresponding anti - stoke photon modes .",
    "* d * , a teleportation scheme using the photon - phonon entanglement .",
    "an input state is prepared by the message sender , alice , on the photon s polarization degree of freedom .",
    "the photon thus carries two qubits , one by its polarization and one by its spatial modes .",
    "alice performs bell measurements on these two qubits .",
    "conditional on certain measurement outcomes , the phonon state is projected to the same state input on alice s side , which is read out and verified by bob , the message receiver .",
    ", width=321,height=264 ]      we illustrate our entanglement generation and quantum teleportation scheme in fig .",
    "1 , using a type iia single - crystal synthetic diamond sample cut along the @xmath11 face from the element six company . due to the strong interaction of atoms in the diamond , the optical phonon mode , which represents relative oscillation of the two sublattices in the stiff diamond lattice ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , has a very high excitation frequency about @xmath12 @xmath13 near the momentum zero point in the brillouin zone .",
    "the corresponding energy scale for this excitation is significantly higher than the room temperature thermal energy ( about @xmath14 @xmath13 ) , and thus the optical phonon mode naturally stays at the vacuum state under ambient conditions , which simplifies its quantum control * * @xcite**. the coherence life time of the optical phonon mode is about @xmath15 ps at room temperature , which is short but accessible with the ultrafast laser technology for which the operational speed can be up to about @xmath16 thz * * @xcite**.    we excite the optical phonon modes through ultrafast laser pulses of duration around @xmath17 fs from the ti - sapphire laser , with the carrier wavelength at @xmath18 nm . the diamond has a large bandgap of @xmath19 ev , so the laser pulses are far detuned from the conduction band with a large gap about @xmath20 thz .",
    "each laser pulse generates , with a small probability @xmath21 , an excitation in the optical phonon mode and a stokes photon of wavelength @xmath22 nm in the forward direction ( see fig",

    ", we split the laser pulse into two coherent paths as shown in fig .",
    "1b , and the pulse in each path generates the corresponding phonon - photon correlated state described by eq .",
    "when there is an output photon , in one of the two paths , it is in the following maximally entangled state with the phonon excitation@xmath28here , @xmath29 or @xmath30 represents an excitation in the upper or lower path , and its subscript denotes the nature of the excitation , `` n '' for a phonon and `` t '' for a photon .",
    "we drop the vacuum term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) as it is eliminated if we detect a photon emerging from one of the two paths . after entanglement generation",
    ", the photon state can be directly measured through single - photon detectors . to read out the phonon state",
    ", we apply another ultrafast laser pulse after a controllable delay within the coherence time of the optical phonon mode and convert the phononic state to the same photonic state in the forward anti - stokes mode at the wavelength of @xmath31 nm ( see fig .",
    "the state of the anti - stokes photon is then measured through single - photon detectors together with linear optics devices . note that the retrieval laser pulse could have a carrier frequency @xmath32 different from that of the pump laser .",
    "for instance , with @xmath32 near the telecom band , our teleportation protocol would naturally realize a quantum frequency transducer that transfers the photon s frequency to a desired band without changing its quantum state .",
    "a quantum frequency transducer is widely recognized as an important component for realization of long - distance quantum networks * * @xcite**.    to realize teleportation , we need to prepare another qubit , whose state will be teleported to the phonon modes in the diamond . similar to the teleportation experiments in refs . * * @xcite * * , we use the polarization state of the photon to represent the input qubit , which can be independently prepared into an arbitrary state @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the horizontal and the vertical polarization states and @xmath36 are arbitrary coefficients .",
    "the bell measurements on the polarization and the path qubits carried by the same photon can be implemented through linear optics devices together with single - photon detection ( see fig .",
    "1d ) , and the teleported state to the phononic modes is retrieved and detected through its conversion to the anti - stokes photon .",
    "same as ref .",
    "* * @xcite * * , the short life time of the diamond s vibration modes requires us to retrieve and detect the phonon s state before applying detection on the stokes photon , thus the phonon s state is measured before the teleportation protocol is completed .",
    "the reversed time ordering in this demonstration of quantum teleportation makes it unsuitable for application in quantum repeaters which requires a much longer memory time , however , it does not affect application of our teleportation experiment for realization of a quantum frequency transducer or a new source of entangled photons as discussed above .",
    "mhz , a carrier wavelength of @xmath18 nm , and a polarization along the @xmath37 direction , are split by a birefringent calcite into two coherent paths with equal amplitudes .",
    "after rotation of the pulse polarization to equal superposition of @xmath38 and @xmath39 again with a half wave plate ( hwp1 ) set at @xmath40 , we introduce a time delay of @xmath41 fs to the two polarization components @xmath42 and @xmath43 with a birefringent bbocrystal .",
    "we use the lead pulse of @xmath42  polarization as the write beam and the lagged pulse of @xmath43  polarization as the read beam . after semicircle hwps set at @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , at the upper and lower paths ,",
    "the polarization states of the pump beams are shown in the figure before the diamond sample .",
    "the write beam is focused by the lens l1 on the diamond sample and generates a stokes photon in one of the paths and an excitation in the corresponding optical phonon modes of the diamond .",
    "the stokes photon , at the wavelength of @xmath22 nm , is transmitted by the dichromatic mirror dm1 after the collection lens l2 , with its two paths recombined by the calcite c2 . to verify entanglement",
    ", we do not need hwp3 and the optical elements in the state preparation box .",
    "the lens l3 and l4 are used to adjust the distance between the two optical paths so that they can be combined at the calcite c2 .",
    "the single - photon detector apd2 , together with rotation of the polarizer p2 , detects the two path ( or polarization ) components of the stokes photon in different bases . to read out the state of the phonon modes , the read pulse converts the phonon to the anti - stokes photon in the corresponding paths , preserving its quantum state .",
    "the anti - stokes photon , at a shorter wavelength of @xmath31 nm , is reflected by both of the dichromatic mirrors dm1 and dm2 , with its two paths recombined through the calcite c3 .",
    "the single - photon detector apd1 , together with rotation of the half and the quarter wave plates hwp5 and qwp2 , detects the anti - stokes photon ( and thus the phonon ) in any superposition bases . for quantum teleportation , semicircle hwps and the polarizer p1 in the state preparation box",
    "transforms the photon - phonon entangled state to the standard form of eq .",
    "( 2 ) and initializes the photon polarization to the state @xmath46 .",
    "the waveplates hwp2 and qwp1 then prepare the to - be - teleported photon polarization to any superposition state .",
    "the calcite c2 , the hwp3 , the polarizer p2 , and the detector apd2 , together , make a bell measurement on the two qubits carried by the polarization and the path degrees of freedom of the same photon .",
    "the photon coincidence counts are registered through a fpga ( field - programmable gate array ) board with a @xmath47 nm coincidence window . , width=642,height=264 ]      our experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    ", we verify entanglement generated between the stokes photon and the optical phonon modes in the diamond . for this step",
    ", we remove the optical elements in the state preparation box shown in fig . 2 and set the angle of hwp3 to @xmath44 .",
    "different from the scheme illustrated in fig . 1 , we insert semicircle hwps set at @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , at the upper and the lower paths of the pump beam , so that both the stokes photon and the anti - stokes photon after the retrieval pulse have orthogonal polarizations along the two output paths , which can be combined together through the calcites c2 and c3 .",
    "this facilitates the entanglement measurement through detection in complementary local bases by rotating the polarizers p2 and p3 and the wave plates hwp5 and qwp2 . due to the different incident directions of the pump pulses at the upper and the lower paths , the corresponding phonon modes excited in the diamond have different momenta , so they represent independent modes even if they have partial spatial overlap .",
    "the phonon is converted to the anti - stokes photon by the retrieval pulse , so we measure the photon - phonon state by detecting the coincidence counts between stokes and anti - stokes photons in different bases . in fig .",
    "3a , we show the registered coincidence counts as we rotate the angle of the polarizer p2 .",
    "the oscillation of the coincidence counts with a visibility of @xmath48 is an indicator of coherence of the underlying state . to verify entanglement of the photon - phonon state , we use quantum state tomography to reconstruct the full density matrix from the measured coincidence counts",
    "* * @xcite * * , with the resulting matrix elements shown in fig .",
    "3b . from the reconstructed density matrix @xmath49",
    ", we find its entanglement fidelity , defined as the maximum overlap of @xmath49 with a maximally entangled state , @xmath50 , significantly higher than the criterion of @xmath51 for verification of entanglement * * @xcite**. the error bars are determined by assuming a poissonian distribution for the photon counts and propagated from the raw data to the calculated quantities through exact numerical simulation .",
    "the dominant noise in this system comes from the accidental coincidence between the detected stokes and the anti - stokes photons * * @xcite**. to measure the contribution of this accidental coincidence , we introduce an extra time delay of @xmath52 @xmath53 , the repetition period of our pump pulses , to one of the detectors when we record the coincidence .",
    "when we subtract the background noise due to this accidental coincidence , the resulting matrix elements reconstructed from the quantum state tomography are shown in fig .",

    "for instance , with the hwp3 set at @xmath44 and the polarizer p2 set along the direction @xmath59 , a photon count in the detector apd2 corresponds to a projection to the bell state @xmath60 for the polarization and the path qubits of the photon before the measurement box . by rotating the angles of hwp3 and p2 , we can also perform projection to any other bell states .    the experimental result for teleportation is shown in fig .",

    "the average fidelity over these six bases states is @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) with ( or without ) background noise subtraction .",
