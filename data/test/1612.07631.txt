    "silicon photomultipliers ( sipms ) are constructed on a single substrate and consist of thousands of microcells operating in the geiger mode . the gain and quantum efficiency of the sipms",
    "are comparable to those of the photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "they are compact in size and insensitive to magnetic fields . with low - operating voltages",
    ", it simplifies the circuit design for electrical safety considerations .",
    "therefore , they are a good alternative to pmts @xcite .",
    "however , the conventional pmts are available in various sizes that are as large as a few tens of cm in diameter . in contrast",
    ", the largest single - chip sipm is less than 1  @xmath0 . for scintillation detectors ,",
    "the efficiency of scintillation photon collection increases with the area of the photon sensor .",
    "moreover , a larger detector volume has a higher sensitivity for radiation detection . because of the small active area of the sipms , it is necessary to use multiple sipms to increase the efficiency of photon collection for a larger scintillator . in this work ,",
    "scintillation detectors are constructed and tested with a custom 2x2 sipm array .",
    "the layout of the sipm array and the geometry of the scintillator were determined by performing geant4 simulations @xcite in which a point source is located 20  cm from the front of the scintillator .",
    "the @xmath2-rays are emitted uniformly random in a cone irradiating a circular area inscribed by the front surface .",
    "the surface finish of the scintillator is modeled using the `` groundteflonair '' option in the look - up - table ( lut ) @xcite . a thin layer of optical grease , 0.1  mm , is sandwiched between the scintillator and the sipms for transporting scintillation photons .",
    "the array has four 6x6 mm@xmath3 sipms arranged in a 2x2 configuration such that the electronics is less complicated .",
    "the goal of the simulations was to find the optimum geometry of the scintillator and the layout of the sipms for good @xmath2-ray energy resolution .",
    "it is found that the energy resolution of a detector is better for the scintillator with an area comparable to the active area of the sipm array . since the sipms are arranged as a square or rectangle in the array , scintillators with a square or rectangular cross section have a better energy resolution than those with a circular cross section . shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : resolgap](a ) is the photon distribution at the exit surface of an 18  mm cubic scintillator . the profile of photon distribution for a 6  mm horizontal strip across the middle of the exit surface is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : resolgap](b ) .",
    "as can be seen , more scintillation photons are distributed near the center of the exit surface of the scintillator .    for scintillators with a cross section larger than the active area of the sipms , leaving a gap between the sipms leads to a better energy resolution . in fig .",
    "[ fg : resolgap](c ) , the energy resolution for an 18  mm cubic scintillator as a function of the gap size between the active area of the sipms is shown .",
    "the best energy resolution is for the gap size between 1 and 2  mm . for larger gap sizes ,",
    "the resolution gets worse slowly but a shoulder starts to develop on either side of the photopeak resulting in a poorer full - width - at - tenth - maximum .",
    "[ fg : spk18gap ] shows the simulated 662  kev @xmath2-ray spectra detected by the 18  mm cubic scintillator and sipm array with the gap size of 0.2 , 1.4 , and 4.0  mm .",
    "it can be seen that for the gap size of 4.0  mm a noticeable shoulder appears on the high - energy side of the photopeak and the trough between the photopeak and the compton edge is higher as well .",
    "furthermore , the photopeak position shifts to lower channels as the gap size increases .",
    "this is due to less photons distributed away from the center of the detection plane as shown in the profile of photon distribution in fig .",

    "a sipm array with four 6x6  mm@xmath3 sipms @xcite has been constructed following the analysis of the geant4 simulations .",
    "three types of scintillators , nai , csi , and cs@xmath4liycl@xmath5:ce@xmath6(clyc ) , have been tested with this sipm array .",
    "the scintillator and sipm array were enclosed in a hermetically sealed aluminum container to keep out moisture and ambient light .",
    "all the tests were performed in a temperature controlled chamber .",
    "the three detectors were tested using a @xmath7cs source with the sipms biased at 27.5  v so that the detectors had the same nominal gain .",
    "the output of the preamp was recorded by a waveform digitizer ( struck sis3302 ) operating at 100  mhz .",
    "the response of the detectors to the 662  kev @xmath2-ray from @xmath7cs was compared by making a histogram of the integral of the digitized pulses .",
    "because the clyc pulse has a long - decay component , an integration time of 20  @xmath8s was used for all the scintillators in order to make an unbiased comparison .",
    "consequently , the counting rate was kept low to minimize pulse pileup .",
    "as the decay time for nai and csi is shorter , integrating these pulses for such a long time could introduce noise to the integrals .",
    "since the comparison was for the detector response , the influence of noise on energy resolution was ignored for the current test .",
    "a separate measurement using the proper integration time for each scintillator was carried out to compare the energy resolution .",
    "figure  [ fg : lightout ] shows the normalized histogram of 10,000 pulse integrals for the three detectors .",
    "the nai detector has the largest output because the sipm response is optimized for the 420  nm scintillation photon .",
    "although csi has a larger yield of scintillation photons , the detector response is actually smaller than nai .",
    "this is due to the mismatch between the scintillation spectrum of csi and the response of the sipms .",

    "the breakdown voltage also increases with temperature which results in gain variation following temperature changes . in order to optimize the detector resolution ,",
    "the gain for the sipms was adjusted to be the same within the array .",
    "furthermore , the gain for the entire sipm array was stabilized over the temperature range between 20 and 50  @xmath1c @xcite . to check the quality of temperature stabilization , @xmath2-ray sources , @xmath9eu , @xmath10co , @xmath7cs , and @xmath11th ,",

    "it has been reported that an energy resolution of 4% was observed for a 1  @xmath12 clyc scintillator coupled to a pmt . however , when the same clyc scintillator was coupled to sipms the energy resolution was between 6.2% and 8.3% @xcite . the @xmath7cs @xmath2-ray spectrum measured by the csi detector at 20  @xmath1c",

    "[ fg : restemp ] .",
    "the variation in energy resolution for the csi detector is small . at high temperatures ,",
    "the poorer resolution is likely due to noise in the sipms whereas at low temperatures the poorer resolution is attributed to a lower light yield of the scintillator . for the clyc detector ,",
    "the energy resolution is much worse than that for csi , particularly well below and above room temperature . at 20  @xmath1c ,",
    "the 662  kev photopeak is barely visible in the @xmath2-ray spectrum .",
    "a previous study using a smaller crystal , 1  @xmath13 , obtained mixed results for resolution as a function of temperature @xcite . in that study , sipms from different manufacturers were compared .",
    "for the sensl sipm , the variation of energy resolution with temperature is smaller as compared to the present work . for the hamamatsu sipm ,",
    "resolution as poor as 14% was measured at 10  @xmath1c .",
    "since clyc crystals are known to be fragile , it is conceivable that fractures might have developed in the crystal that was used in this work .",
    "this makes the use of clyc for portable radiation detectors challenging because these instruments are required to operate between 20 and 50  @xmath1c .",
    "in addition to studying the three detectors , a large number of csi detectors have been tested which allow for examining the characteristics of the sipms . fig .  [",

    ", the neutron is expected at 3.2  mev in the @xmath2-ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "since @xmath11th has a 2.6  mev @xmath2-peak , it was used along with @xmath14cf to test n-@xmath2 discrimination and as a reference for the energy spectrum . because the largest difference in the pulse shape occurs in the first 2  @xmath8s , a shorter integration time of 4.5  @xmath8s , instead of 20  @xmath8s ,",
    "was used to speed up the data acquisition .",
    "[ fg : clyc1d ] shows the @xmath2-ray spectrum detected by the clyc detector .",

    "this agrees with the manufacturer s specification @xcite . as can be seen",
    ", the neutron distribution is fairly broad and overlaps with the high - energy tail of the 2.6  mev @xmath2-peak .",
