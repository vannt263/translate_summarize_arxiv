    "neutron scattering is one of the most important tools to determine the structure and dynamics of condensed matter .",
    "one of its major advantages is that the neutron as an electrically neutral probe is not influenced by the electron cloud of the target atoms but interacts only with the nucleus .",
    "consequently neutron scattering can be directly interpreted in terms of the atomic structure and motion .",
    "however , if one wants to examine a molecular system not only with respect to the constituent atoms but in terms of the molecular units some care has to be taken .",
    "since the superposition of scattering from atomic sites is in general not equivalent to scattering from the molecular center of mass , neutron scattering from molecular liquids is sensitive to orientational as well as translational correlations in the system .",
    "this was realized already many years ago @xcite and led to different formulations of neutron scattering by molecules . for reasons of simplicity and also because the center of mass correlations were of principle interest those approaches tried to `` correct '' for the effect of orientational degrees of freedom . in the work of sears @xcite this",
    "is done using the so called _ weak hindering approximation _ , i.e. the assumptions of statistical independence of _ i ) _ rotational and translational motion of any molecule and _ ii ) _ rotational motion of any two different molecules .    in recent years",
    "the mode coupling theory of the glass transition ( see e.g. @xcite ) stimulated a lot of experiments on supercooled liquids . among other techniques",
    "also neutron scattering was used ( see e.g. @xcite and for more recent work @xcite ) to study the static and dynamic properties of glassforming substances most of which are of molecular nature , like e.g. glycerol , salol or orthoterphenyl . in the situation of the dense packed molecular liquid where the motion becomes more and more cooperative the assumptions of sears are not reasonable anymore as was shown by chen et al .",
    "@xcite for incoherent neutron scattering in simulated supercooled water .",
    "below , in the study of a liquid of diatomic rigid molecules we will come to the same conclusion for coherent scattering .",
    "this raises the question how neutron scattering data can be analyzed in terms of the molecules in this case .    with increasing computer power the simulations of supercooled liquids trend to deal with more realistic model systems @xcite like spc / e water @xcite or orthoterphenyl @xcite .",
    "thus it has become feasible to examine in detail also the orientational degrees of freedom in the strongly supercooled regime ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in experiments",
    "it is up to now only possible to measure orientational correlators for @xmath3 , i.e. one does not get information about the spatial arrangement of orientationally correlated molecules . on the other hand this information would be valuable to understand the interaction between translational and orientational degrees of freedom",
    ". therefore it seems sensible to examine in which way orientational correlations enter into the neutron scattering function .",
    "a feature of special interest in supercooled liquids and glasses is the appearance of a prepeak in the static ns  structure factor at a @xmath1value that corresponds to distances larger than the average nearest neighbour distance . as a sign of intermediate range order prepeaks",
    "have been studied in a variety of systems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . mostly they have been attributed to the network structure of strong glasses or charge effects in ionic glassformers .",
    "the behaviour of prepeaks in molecular systems seems to be quite different as was pointed out recently by morineau et al .",
    "@xcite in their study of the temperature and pressure  dependence for m  toluidine and m  fluoroaniline which will be discussed in section [ prepeak ] .",
    "we will present results for the ns ",
    "static structure factor of a liquid of diatomic molecules , i.e. one of the most simple systems in which effects of the molecular nature can be studied .",
    "we will discuss the dependence of the prepeak on temperature and scattering length and make comparison to findings for other systems . using the representation of @xmath2 in terms of the molecular correlation functions we will also give strong evidence that the existence of the peak is closely connected to orientational degrees of freedom .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ theory ] we will summarize shortly the approach of sears to the intermediate scattering function @xmath0 for molecular systems .",
    "we will show that dropping the weak hindering approximation leads naturely to a description in terms of molecular correlation functions .",
    "some aspects of the representation for arbitrary molecules are discussed and hints for an application to experiments are given .",
    "section [ results ] presents the results from the molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of a system of diatomic molecules .",
    "it is divided into three subsection concerning respectively the molecular correlation functions , the ns - static structure factor and a detailed discussion of the prepeak .",
    "the final section gives some conclusions .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath4 rigid molecules of identical geometry each consisting of @xmath5 atoms .",
    "the assumption of rigidity is one that is commonly used as well in the theoretical analysis as in computer simulation of the liquid state .",
    "it is justified on the ground that at the temperature of the liquid only the lowest vibrational states are populated .",
    "the starting point of an analysis of neutron scattering from molecules is the following site  site ",
    "representation of the intermediate scattering function ( see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath6    where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the coherent ( incoherent ) scattering length and @xmath9 the position of atom @xmath10 in molecule @xmath11 at time @xmath12 .",
    "the brackets @xmath13 denote the canonical averaging over initial conditions . unlike the geometry which is supposed to be identical for all molecules the scattering length",
    "are allowed to differ from molecule to molecule .",
    "this assumption is quite realistic since the chemical structure is independent of the isotopic composition whereas the scattering lengths are .    appealing as this site  site  description is , it is not very favourable from a molecular view .",
    "the rigid molecules are most suitably described by the center of mass coordinates @xmath14 and the euler angles @xmath15 giving the orientation of the body fixed system relative to the laboratory frame .    to make a connection between these two different views sears @xcite introduced center of mass and relative coordinates by @xmath16 and used the rayleigh expansion of the plane waves    @xmath17^\\frac{1}{2 } i^l j_l(q r_\\nu ) \\ ; \\cdot \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ ; \\cdot \\ ; y_l^n(\\vartheta_\\nu,\\varphi_\\nu )   { \\cal d}^l_{0n}(\\omega_j(t ) ) \\label{eq : rayleigh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 are the polar coordinates of atom @xmath10 with respect to the body fixed frame with origin at the center of mass of molecule @xmath11 . without loss of generality the @xmath19axis of the laboratory frame has been chosen to point in direction of @xmath20 .",
    "the special functions appearing in eq.([eq : rayleigh ] ) are the spherical bessel functions @xmath21 , the spherical harmonics @xmath22 and the wigner functions @xmath23 @xcite . in the summation of eq.([eq : rayleigh ] ) @xmath24 runs over @xmath25 and @xmath26 is restricted by @xmath27 .    following this strategy and _ not _ doing any factorization of translational and rotational motion or of rotational motion of different molecules one is naturely led to consider correlation functions of the following kind    @xmath28^\\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{j j ' } \\ ; \\cdot \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad \\cdot \\ ; \\langle e^{-i q ( r_j^z(t)-r_{j'}^z ) } { \\cal d}_{mn}^l(\\omega_j(t ) ) { \\cal d}_{mn'}^{l ' \\ast}(\\omega_{j ' } ) \\rangle , \\label{eq : smolqt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which equal @xmath29 , the correlation function of the tensorial one particle density mode @xmath30 @xcite . as usual",
    "it is possible to separate them into self ( @xmath31 ) and distinct terms ( @xmath32 ) giving    @xmath33    this set of correlation functions is the generalization to arbitrary molecules of the correlators introduced in the mode coupling theory for a single molecule in an atomic liquid @xcite and for liquids of linear molecules @xcite and has been used recently to study molecular correlations in supercooled water @xcite and diatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "similar correlation functions have also been used earlier in the study of molecular liquids @xcite and go back to the work on statistical mechanics of nonspherical molecules by steele @xcite .    on first sight one",
    "might be scared by the large number of indices and not willing to consider an infinite set of correlation functions .",
    "therefore we want to stress that due to the tensorial nature of the quantities ( [ eq : smolqt ] ) the symmetry of the molecule may reduce the number of correlators .",
    "secondly one can expect that reasonable results can be achieved already if one considers only the finite number of correlators with @xmath34 for small @xmath35 . for a system of diatomic molecules we will see in section [ results ] that @xmath36 turns out to be sufficient to describe @xmath2 in the @xmath1range of interest .",
    "depending on the size and form of the molecules it might be necessary to consider also larger values for @xmath35 .",
    "this becomes clear if one looks at the angular dependence of the wigner functions since extending the range of @xmath24 corresponds mainly to improving the angular resolution . in this argument",
    "we have considered the factors @xmath37 in eq.([eq : smolqt ] ) as `` weights '' which select molecules within a certain range of orientations for the canonical averaging .",
    "while for instance @xmath38 gives equal weight to all orientations , @xmath39 puts emphasis on molecules with @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "this may elucidate a bit more the meaning of the @xmath1dependent orientational correlators .",
    "having introduced the suitable correlation functions eqs.([eq : site - site])([eq : smolqt ] ) can be easily combined to give    @xmath42 \\label{eq : snresult1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the coefficients    @xmath43 \\label{eq : binc } \\\\ & & b_{ln , l'n'}^{coh}(q ) = \\frac{1}{s } \\sum_{\\nu \\nu ' } 4 \\pi j_l(q r_\\nu ) j_{l'}(q r_{\\nu ' } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad y_l^{n \\ast}(\\vartheta_\\nu,\\varphi_\\nu ) y_{l'}^{n'}(\\vartheta_{\\nu'},\\varphi_{\\nu ' } ) \\overline{a_{coh}^\\nu } \\overline{a_{coh}^{\\nu'}}. \\label{eq : bcoh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath44 denotes the average over molecules . for the special case of a single linear molecule in an isotropic liquid",
    "a similar result has been given by franosch et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the representation eq.([eq : snresult1 ] ) has a number of interesting properties .",
    "immediately obvious is that it can be fourier transformed to give a corresponding relation for the spectra or susceptibilities with the same coefficients .",
    "further we notice that only correlators with @xmath45 enter into @xmath0 which is a consequence of the isotropy of the fluid . from the general expression",
    "one can also draw some conclusions about the @xmath1dependence of the ns  intermediate scattering function .",
    "eq.([eq : snresult1 ] ) clearly reflects that neutron scattering from molecular liquids is the superposition of two contributions : @xmath46 the correlations within a molecule which are expressed in the incoherent terms involving the self  part of the molecular correlation functions and @xmath47 the correlation between molecules which enter the distinct terms .",
    "the @xmath1dependence of both contributions again has two sources .",
    "the coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 which could be termed _",
    "incoherent _ and _ coherent molecular form factors _ respectively are completely determined by the molecular geometry and the scattering lengths . thus they can be calculated exactly if the molecular units are known .",
    "their @xmath1dependence is given by the spherical bessel functions @xmath50 and thus connected primarily to the distances @xmath51 of the atoms from the center of mass of the molecule .",
    "we will discuss the @xmath1dependence of the molecular form factors in more detail in the following section .",
    "the more important quantities that enter into the @xmath1dependence of @xmath0 are of course the molecular correlation functions which give a statistical description of the interactions and the dynamic of the system .",
    "we will discuss their @xmath1dependence for the mentioned model system in the first subsection of the following section .",
    "the coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath48 represent weighting functions that determine at which @xmath1values a given molecular correlation function @xmath52 appreciably contributes to @xmath0 . in turn knowledge of the molecular form factors could be used to attribute the structure of the ns  intermediate scattering function to some molecular correlation functions . to undertake such an effort one would have to do a series of experiments in which the molecular form factors @xmath49 and @xmath48 are varied systematically .",
    "a common technique to do so would be the use of isotopes of different scattering length , i.e. to combine results obtained with mixtures of different isotopic composition . from the discussion of eq.([eq : snresult1 ] ) given above we can conclude the following limitations : @xmath46 only molecular correlation functions @xmath52 with @xmath45 are accessible , @xmath47 information about the correlator @xmath52 can only be extracted from @xmath0 in a @xmath1range where the form factor @xmath53 is different from zero and not too small compared to the other form factors . upon changing the scattering lengths one can separate the site  site correlation functions contributing to @xmath0 .",
    "since these are connected by a linear relation with the functions @xmath54 ( as a special case of eqs.([eq : snresult1])([eq : bcoh ] ) ) we have @xmath55 the number of molecular correlation functions that can be determined ( for a given @xmath1 ) is restricted by the number of site ",
    "site correlators .",
    "since the molecular form factors depend also on the atomic configuration within the molecule another idea would be to compare results for molecules with similar geometry . to examine the structure of a liquid of diatomic molecules one could for example try to combine results for @xmath56,@xmath57,@xmath58 and @xmath59 taking into account the shift in the average nearest neighbour distance due to the difference in atomic size by rescaling the @xmath1-values accordingly .",
    "in such a way one could change systematically the intramolecular distance @xmath60 .",
    "although this would offer a way to bypass the limitations given by @xmath55 changing the geometry will also affect the molecular correlation functions themselves .    in spite of this limitations",
    "we think that experimental efforts in the direction of determining molecular correlation functions from neutron scattering are worth considering . here",
    "one has to keep in mind that up to now information about the orientational degrees of freedom is restricted to the few @xmath3correlation functions that can be measured by dielectric response or nmr . especially to understand the interaction between rotational and translational degrees of freedom the @xmath1dependent molecular correlation function have to be considered",
    "we will now turn to the examination of a special system . on the one hand",
    "this will give us the opportunity to illustrate the molecular correlation functions and the representation of the scattering function introduced in sec .",
    "[ theory ] . on the other hand",
    "the system shows interesting features which are apparent in the ns ",
    "static structure factor @xmath2 and give on their own a motivation for a detailed inspection .",
    "we will study a simulated supercooled liquid of 500 diatomic rigid molecules each consisting of two atoms which will be labeled a and b. the atoms have equal masses but the head  tail ",
    "symmetry is slightly broken by the interactions which are given by a superposition of lennard ",
    "jones potentials between the atomic sites .",
    "the molecular bond length was fixed at @xmath61 in units of the lennard ",
    "jones radius of the a  atoms which we will use throughout this article .",
    "particularly , @xmath1 is given in units of @xmath62 times the inverse of that radius .",
    "for further details about the molecular dynamics simulation and the potential we refer the reader to refs.@xcite .    in the following",
    "we will concentrate on the static properties of the system .",
    "this is done because of a number of reasons : @xmath46 to test the convergence of the series representation ( [ eq : snresult1 ] ) as function of the @xmath24cutoff , it is sensible to consider the worst case .",
    "usually this should be given by the static case as the following argument explains .",
    "if one assumes that the relaxation of the odof takes place primarily through small angular variations and that large angular jumps can be neglected the correlators with larger @xmath24 , i.e. better angular resolution , will decay faster than those with small @xmath24 .",
    "therefore one concludes that for @xmath63 terms with larger @xmath24 are less important than in the static case .",
    "@xmath47 last but not least we are primarily interested in the @xmath1dependence",
    ". thus it will be necessary to choose a fixed time @xmath12 and @xmath64 being a natural choice .",
    "the readers interested as well in the dynamic of the studied system and especially experimentators who are interested in the timescales involved shall be referred to the publications of kmmerer et al .",
    "@xcite where these aspects have been discussed for tdof as well as odof .",
    "we will now present molecular correlation functions for the system of diatomic rigid molecules .",
    "as already mentioned in section [ theory ] the number of independent correlators can be reduced for molecules possessing an intrinsic symmetry . in our case",
    "we deal with linear molecules that are invariant under any rotation around the axis connecting atoms a and b. this axis will be chosen as the @xmath19axis of the body fixed frame of reference in the following .",
    "symmetry considerations similar to those carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite show that the distinct part of the static correlation functions fulfills    @xmath65    since the self part of the static correlation is given simply by @xmath66 all the important structure is contained in the correlation functions with @xmath67 . as pointed out in section [ theory ] for neutron scattering only correlators with @xmath68 are relevant .",
    "thus in the following we will only consider the quantities @xmath69 .",
    "we can further restrict ourselves to @xmath70 since the correlation functions @xmath71 are real and symmetric with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath72 as can be easily seen from their definition ( [ eq : smolqt ] ) .",
    "the correlation functions up to @xmath73 have already been presented by kmmerer et al .",
    "we want to take the opportunity to point out a minor error in this publication : in order to get the correct data which is in accordance with the chosen conventions ( ours and theirs ) the offdiagonal terms given in fig.3 of the last reference of @xcite have to be multiplied by -1 .",
    "the correct graphs for the @xmath68terms are given in our fig.[fig : smolq ] ( b ) .",
    "in addition we have determined all correlators up to @xmath74 .",
    "figures [ fig : smolq ] ( c)-(e ) show the @xmath68terms which are relevant for neutron scattering . in the discussion given below we",
    "will only refer to this data although the properties of the @xmath75terms ( not shown here ) are quite similar .",
    "all the molecular correlation functions have been evaluated at @xmath76 ( in units of the lennard  jones energy @xmath77 of the a  particles ) which is the lowest temperature considered in the simulation .",
    "this is a temperature located in the supercooled regime very close to the critical temperature @xmath78 of the mode coupling theory @xcite",
    ".    we will now give a discussion of the molecular correlators @xmath71 by comparing their @xmath1dependence .",
    "thereby we want to point out the similarities and differences between the @xmath1dependent orientational correlators ( @xmath24 and/or @xmath72 different from zero ) and the better known center of mass correlations ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "we also mention some features for which a general relation between the @xmath1dependence and the values of @xmath24 and @xmath72 seems to exist .",
    "thereby we will substantially enlarge the discussion given by kmmerer et al . which focussed mainly on the @xmath80dependence and the effects of the approximate head  tail symmetry of the molecule .",
    "the most prominent peak is displayed by the center of mass correlator @xmath81 .",
    "located at a @xmath1value of @xmath82 it represents the first order of the nearest neighbour peak .",
    "such a peak can also be found at almost exactly the same position for all correlation functions @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "also for the other correlators this nearest neighbour peak exists but it is usually shifted to a slightly different value than @xmath85 .",
    "this shift can easily be understood .",
    "whereas for @xmath81 an average over all possible orientations of the molecule is done the factor @xmath86 in eq.([eq : smolqt ] ) for @xmath24 and/or @xmath72 unequal zero `` restricts '' the average to a certain range of orientations . since in the supercooled",
    "liquid the molecules are very closely packed the characteristic distance between molecules depends on the choice of orientations @xmath87 and @xmath88 simply because of steric hindrance .",
    "thus for different correlators a shift in the position of the peaks is expected .",
    "a strong support for this picture is also that the peak is much less shifted for @xmath83 as for @xmath71 with @xmath24 and @xmath72 unequal zero because an average over all possible _ relative _ orientations is already done if _ one _ of the angles @xmath87 or @xmath88 is not restricted .",
    "besides the shift in the peak position we observe that the peak amplitude also depends strongly on the correlator .",
    "one reason already pointed out by kmmerer et al .",
    "@xcite is the approximate head ",
    "symmetry of the molecule which results in a smaller amplitude for correlators with @xmath89 odd .",
    "further we can state that the amplitude of the main peak tends to decrease with increasing @xmath90 .",
    "apart from the main maximum the center of mass correlation function @xmath81 shows also structure at higher values of @xmath1 .",
    "clearly perceptible is a double peak at @xmath91 and @xmath92 . whereas the peak at @xmath92 can be identified as the second order of the nearest neighbour peak the origin of the peak at @xmath93 is not quite clear",
    ". it could also be the second order of a peak located around @xmath94 which is merged with the main peak .",
    "rich structure at higher values of @xmath1 is also found in all other molecular correlation functions .",
    "if one takes into account possible shifts in the peak position the peaks located at @xmath95 and @xmath96 can be attributed to the higher orders of the nearest neighbour peak . while their principle origin thus seems to be clear the interesting structure that appears in their shape , which in some cases clearly indicates a double peak ,",
    "can not be understood from the present investigation .    a further aspect which immediately strikes the eye is that , while the oscillations at higher @xmath1 are strongly damped for small @xmath24 and @xmath72 , the higher order peaks are comparable or even larger than the first maximum for the correlators with @xmath97 .",
    "so far we have only considered the structure of the molecular correlation functions for @xmath1values larger than the value of the first maximum corresponding to distances smaller than the average nearest neighbour distance .",
    "the center of mass correlator @xmath98 for @xmath99 resembles the structure also found for simple liquids which is in strong contrast to the behaviour of the molecular correlation functions for @xmath100 .",
    "the correlator @xmath101 exhibits a pronounced maximum at @xmath102 , a @xmath1value corresponding to about twice the average nearest neighbour distance .",
    "a further point worth mentioning is that all diagonal correlators @xmath103 with @xmath104 show a maximum at @xmath105 as was already found for @xmath106 by kmmerer et al .",
    "@xcite . this might indicate a tendency for a _ local _ nematic order . in conclusion of this section",
    "we want to point out that a comparison of our findings with an analysis of the system in real space would be very valuable for a better understanding of the molecular correlation functions . it would be especially interesting to connect the shifts in peak positions , the relation between the peak amplitudes of different correlators and the peak shapes to a microscopic characterization of the system in real space .",
    "as already mentioned above the results of section [ theory ] are best tested for the static case .",
    "the molecular correlation functions necessary for an evaluation of the series representation eq.([eq : snresult1 ] ) have been presented in the previous subsection for @xmath107 .",
    "the result of this calculations will be compared to the exact data for neutron scattering as determined according to eq.([eq : site - site ] ) .",
    "since we are dealing with the special case of linear molecules and static correlations eqs.([eq : snresult1])([eq : bcoh ] ) can be further simplified . as justified in the previous subsection the indices @xmath108 can be set to @xmath109 for the coherent terms if the @xmath19axis of the body  fixed frame of reference is chosen in direction of the symmetry axis connecting both atoms of the molecule .",
    "the polar coordinates of the atoms a and b are given by @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively .",
    "this information can be inserted into eq.([eq : bcoh ] ) for the coherent molecular form factors .",

    "we can combine these reformulations to get the following result for the ns ",

    "[ fig : bcoh ] clarify some properties of the @xmath1dependence of @xmath119 which are quite universal , i.e. valid also in the time  dependent case and for general molecules . in both subfigures",

    "the amplitude of the first maximum quickly reduces and the contribution at the second maximum gets more important .",
    "thus while the offdiagonal terms can not be neglected the relevant range is also shifted to higher values of @xmath1 for growing @xmath72 .",
    "the same is true for the nondiagonal terms with @xmath135 .",
    "consequently the systematic behaviour of the weights @xmath119 can be formulated as a rule of thumb : _ the larger the values of @xmath24 and @xmath134 the higher the value of @xmath1 at which the form factor @xmath119 will become relevant .",
    "_ we merely note that for the form factors as well as for the molecular correlation functions themselves negative values are possible for the offdiagonal terms .",

    "static structure factor itself and test the convergence of the series representation , i.e. the quality of the different approximations @xmath136 , @xmath137 .",

    "the static structure factor exhibits a small but well pronounced prepeak followed by a strong maximum at @xmath143 and further maxima at @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "thus the @xmath1dependence of @xmath2 shows the general structure also found for the molecular correlation functions .",
    "taking a closer look to the various maxima and taking into account the properties we found for the weights @xmath119 we can further illuminate their origin . in case of the prepeak this is rather obvious since @xmath147 ) at @xmath142 only correlators with small @xmath24 and @xmath72 have to be taken into account ( see discussion above ) and @xmath148 ) only @xmath101 possesses a significant peak at @xmath142 .",
    "therefore its origin must be connected to the structure found in the correlation function @xmath101 .",
    "a quantitative analysis of this statement will be given in the following subsection . from the figure [ fig : bcoh ]",
    "we can see that also at the position @xmath143 of the main peak correlators with @xmath24 or @xmath72 larger than 2 do not play a big role .",
    "thus the center of mass correlation function @xmath81 and the molecular correlation function @xmath149,@xmath106 as well as @xmath150 can be identified as the origin of the main peak in @xmath2 .",
    "the latter correlators being responsible for the slight shift of the peak position to higher @xmath1 in comparison with the center of mass correlations . for the peaks at @xmath144 and",
    "@xmath151 a number of correlators will be relevant . using the weights",
    "@xmath122 one can still conclude that @xmath106 will be one of the main sources for the peak at @xmath144 and @xmath152 as well as @xmath153 will be of great relevance for the structure at @xmath154 . from the molecular correlation functions we have determined",
    "@xmath153 is the one which contributes most to the peak at @xmath146 though correlation functions with @xmath155 could also be of great importance .",
    "apart from the exact result for @xmath2 figure [ fig : comp ] ( a ) also shows the result of the weak hindering approximation as used by sears @xcite . except for the limiting values for @xmath156 and @xmath116 the results of this approximation",
    "are rather poor since almost all of the structure in @xmath2 is missed and even the main peak is not reproduced properly .",
    "this finding strongly supports results of chen et al .",
    "@xcite who observed that a factorization of translational and rotational correlations is not suitable for the description of a supercooled liquid .",
    "figure [ fig : comp ] ( b ) shows the convergence of the series representation by presenting the dependence of the error @xmath157 on @xmath35 .",
    "the large error of the sears result corresponding to @xmath158 is already reduced to statistical fluctuations in a range of @xmath1 up to @xmath159 by choosing @xmath160 .",
    "for @xmath36 the static structure factor @xmath2 is almost perfectly reproduced for the entire range of @xmath1values at least up to @xmath161 .",
    "since the @xmath1range chosen here compares well to the values accessible in a real neutron scattering experiment we can conclude that the convergence of the series representation ( [ eq : snresult1 ] ) is fast enough to make it attractive for practical purposes .",
    "the cutoff of the infinite sum at a relatively small value of @xmath35 is well justified , at least for our choice of model .",
    "the actual value of @xmath35 that is sufficient will depend on the size and form of the molecule as well as their interactions @xcite . in accordance with the given rule of thumb increasing",
    "the value of @xmath35 merely corresponds to an enlargement of the range in which @xmath2 is reproduced .",
    "we will now turn to a special feature of the static structure factor .",
    "as already mentioned in the last subsection @xmath2 shows a prepeak at @xmath142 .",
    "given that prepeaks or first sharp diffraction peaks ( fsdp ) have been studied mostly in connection with strong glasses like e.g. @xmath162 @xcite or ionic glassformers @xcite this observation is quite surprising . in the system of diatomic rigid molecules studied here",
    "we neither find a network structure nor do we have long range electrostatic interactions . since the proposed explanations for the prepeak usually rely heavily on the network structure and/or the effects of the ionic charges they can not be applied to the prepeak in the present system . then what could be the mechanism leading to intermediate range order in a system without an extended network or long range interactions ?    in the preceding sections",
    "we have pointed out the connection between the @xmath1dependence of @xmath2 and the contribution of various molecular correlation functions . to understand the mechanism responsible for the formation of a prepeak it will surely be helpful to analyze in detail which of the relevant molecular correlations contribute at @xmath163 .",
    "the contributions of the intramolecular structure factor @xmath113 and the center of mass correlations @xmath164 are of large amplitude but they contain no structure at all at @xmath165 .",
    "since they have opposite signs they almost cancel each other .",
    "together they give the sears  result which does not exhibit any prepeak ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : comp ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the other relevant contributions at @xmath165 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prepeak ] .",
    "thus the importance of the correlator @xmath101 for the formation of the prepeak is corroborated by this quantitative analysis .",
    "besides the negative contribution of @xmath150 no other term shows any structure at @xmath165 . it may be noted that the negative contributions of @xmath101 and @xmath149 at @xmath166 induce a better separation between the prepeak and the main peak . in accord with our `` rule of thumb ''",
    "the terms involving @xmath167 are even less important than @xmath106 .",
    "the predominant role of @xmath101 and the fact that no structure is observed in the center of mass correlation strongly suggest that orientational effects are responsible for the prepeak in the studied system . apart from the evidence given here it seems not too far fetched to consider spatial ordering due to sterical hindrance as a mechanism for prepeaks in molecular systems as close packing @xcite and size effect @xcite",
    "have also been shown to be of great relevance in other systems .",
    "the importance of orientational degrees of freedom for the structure of @xmath2 for liquid halogens and the prepeak in the molecular liquid @xmath168 has also been put forward by misawa @xcite . whereas in his work orientational correlations between neighbouring molecules had to be introduced as an _ assumption _ we have been able to give _ direct _",
    "evidence for their relevance .",
    "taking into account the interpretation of the molecular correlation functions ( see above ) it is also possible to get additional information on the kind of intermediate range order .",
    "@xmath169 has the shape of a dumbbell which is , due to the choice of the body fixed frame , aligned to the symmetry axis connecting the atoms of the molecule .",
    "thus the correlations of @xmath101 at @xmath165 can be attributed to a preference for a parallel orientation of _ next _ nearest neighbours .",
    "apart from the geometric effects leading to a parallel alignment of molecules also energetic affects are important for this `` antiferromagnetic '' order @xmath170 since the vicinity of @xmath171 and @xmath172 molecules is favoured by the choice of lennard  jones energies @xmath173 .",
    "prepeaks have often been reported to show special behaviour . in many glassy systems",
    "an increase of the prepeak amplitude with increasing temperature is found @xcite which is quite contrary to the behaviour of the other peaks in @xmath2 .",
    "the amplitude and position was also shown to be affected by the pressure @xcite and the composition of the liquid @xcite",
    ". therefore it will be interesting to characterize further the behaviour of the prepeak in our system .",
    "[ fig : tdep ] shows the temperature dependence of the prepeak in the range @xmath174 to @xmath175 . to eliminate the background given by the low @xmath1 wing of the main peak we have substracted the @xmath2 at @xmath176 . at this temperature",
    "the prepeak is not discernible anymore .",
    "with increasing temperature the prepeak decreases in amplitude and the width at half maximum grows . in the given temperature range",
    "no shift in the position of the peak can be observed whereas the main peak is shifted downwards by @xmath177 . although seemingly uncommon for a prepeak such temperature dependence has been reported before .",
    "it has been found for carbon tetrachloride @xcite and also in a recent study of m  toluol and m ",
    "fluoranilin by morineau et al .",
    "@xcite . like our system these are molecular liquids .",
    "thus one is tempted to infer that this behaviour might be typical for such systems .",
    "we are not able to determine the pressure dependence of the prepeak or to study effects of composition , i.e. the influence of atomic size and interactions since this has not been done in the simulation @xcite .",
    "still we want to point out one aspect which is closely related to compositional studies but has never been considered before .",
    "a substitution of atoms of a certain species in the liquid will not only alter the interactions and the size of the atoms but will also affect the scattering lengths .",
    "figure [ fig : adep ] shows that the observability of the intermediate range order as a prepeak can indeed be influenced . as can also be inferred from eq.([eq : snresult2 ] ) in the case @xmath178 , i.e. @xmath179 , the correlator @xmath101 gives no contribution to @xmath2 and the prepeak vanishes .",
    "keeping the overall normalization constant and increasing the asymmetry in the scattering lengths the prepeak grows to its maximum value . since at the small @xmath1value of the prepeak position the molecular correlation function with @xmath180 will be the most important one ( apart from @xmath81 ) a prepeak in molecular systems",
    "will be most easily observed for molecules with _ no _ head  tail  symmetry .",
    "thus it is for instance not surprising that in liquid halogens no prepeak is observed although their liquid structure might be not too different from our system @xcite .",
    "tackling the problem of neutron scattering in supercooled molecular liquids we have shown that well known concepts can be generalized naturely to give a concise description including all molecular degrees of freedom .",

    "the resulting description of @xmath0 in terms of molecular correlation functions @xmath181 was shown to shed light on the @xmath1dependence offering clear relations between the @xmath1range and the angular resolution described by the `` quantum numbers '' @xmath24 and @xmath26 . giving a relation between the intermediate scattering function and the molecular correlations",
    "the representation could be used to extract ( partial ) information on the correlations of tdof as well as odof and their interference from neutron scattering experiments . from the general expression we were able to give hints for an effort in this direction .",
