    "the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is achieved in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments at relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) in bnl and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in cern .",
    "more and more information on properties of strongly interacting quark - gluon matter in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is being accumulated . however , despite a number of interesting discoveries and new notions established in experiments , the thermalization mechanism that leads to the qgp still lacks a deep understanding based on qcd first principles .",
    "there have been many attempts to estimate the thermalization time scale , that is phenomenologically known to be @xmath0 from analysis in hydrodynamic models  @xcite .",
    "it was argued  @xcite that perturbative qcd processes lead to a thermalization time of order @xmath1 where the saturation momentum @xmath2 is a characteristic hard scale in the high - energy reactions ; @xmath3-@xmath4 in the typical rhic kinematics .",
    "if the prefactor is of order unity , this estimate would yield a thermalization time around several @xmath5 , which is too slow to account for the rhic observations .",
    "it has also been suggested that qcd perturbation theory , no matter at which order one truncates it , may be unable to describe thermalization at all  @xcite .",
    "plasma instabilities , particularly the weibel instability  @xcite , could be promising candidates for the early thermalization mechanism  @xcite and have been well investigated in the hard - loop formalism  @xcite .",
    "there are also various other approaches  @xcite including a framework based on the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , in which thermalization appears as the formation of a black hole horizon in the dual theory .",
    "parallel to the analysis on plasma instabilities , an important observation was made in a related theoretical framework .",
    "the occupation number of gluons at high energy is so huge that color field amplitudes @xmath6 can be realized , and then non - linearities must be taken into account to all orders . instead of a plain perturbative expansion ,",
    "then , an approximation in terms of classical field equations becomes more suitable because it effectively makes a resummation of large - amplitude fields @xmath7 .",
    "this non - linear regime , whose natural time scale is of order @xmath8 at rhic , is expected to be prevalent during the early stages in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the qcd framework known as the color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite rearranges the perturbative expansion in terms of classical fields ( that correspond to the resummation of infinite sets of graphs ) , and perturbations on top of these classical fields are of higher order in @xmath9 .",
    "the cgc was first developed in order to deal with the saturation effect in the gluon distribution function  @xcite .",
    "because we are interested in the early time ( @xmath10 ) dynamics before thermalization , the cgc description seems to be the most suited for our purpose .",
    "the initial condition just above the forward light - cone ( i.e.  at @xmath11 ) for the classical field that appears at lowest order in the cgc description can be nicely formulated in the bjorken ( expanding ) coordinates  @xcite . because in the regime of large occupation numbers , classical field theory and kinetic theory essentially describe the same dynamics  @xcite , it is conceivable that the cgc can describe the isotropization and thermalization processes qualitatively . however , for this program to have a chance to work , it is necessary to go beyond the lowest order description , since at zeroth order it is well known that the pressure tensor never isotropizes .",
    "it is unfortunately impossible to obtain an analytical solution of the classical yang - mills equations of motion for the heavy - ion collision ( two - source ) problem , and therefore one has to resort to numerical simulations . in refs .",
    "@xcite , heavy - ion collisions were simulated in the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model ( i.e.  the cgc at lowest order , with a local gaussian distribution of color sources ) , formulated gauge - invariantly in terms of link variables .",
    "these numerical calculations were later confirmed by an independent simulation in ref .",
    "the peculiar feature in the cgc description at leading order is that the initial condition for the classical fields is independent of the space - time rapidity variable @xmath12 , and the equations of motion maintain @xmath12-independence during the time evolution .",
    "therefore , the space - time evolution is entirely independent of @xmath12 , that is , invariant under boosts in the direction of the collision axis .",
    "intuitively , one can expect a longitudinally extended structure of the initial fields , which is indeed a characteristic property of the so - called `` glasma '' state  @xcite , which could be a source for the so - called ridge structure seen in the two - particle correlations at rhic and lhc  @xcite .    within the cgc framework",
    ", an instability has been found when the boost invariant glasma fields are disturbed  @xcite .",
    "this instability has some similarities to the weibel instability in anisotropic plasmas , but the origin of the instability is not yet fully clarified , though several interpretations have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "also , it is still an issue how to properly formulate disturbances to the boost invariant cgc background .",
    "however , it is clear that such perturbations arise when one considers higher order corrections to the leading cgc picture  @xcite , and therefore they should not be ignored since they can alter phenomena such as particle production  @xcite , etc .",
    "moreover , without including these perturbations , one can not quantify the thermalization processes .",
    "one of the reasons why the origin of the glasma instability lacks a clear understanding is that the available numerical data from earlier works  @xcite is rather limited .",
    "this motivates us to carry out a more systematic survey of the glasma instability , exploiting a wider range of simulation parameters . in this work",
    "we will specifically investigate the dependence of the glasma instability on the following parameters :    * [ i ] * _ transverse grid size @xmath13 : _   it is known that the initial energy density at @xmath11 is sensitive to the ultraviolet and infrared regulators in the transverse direction , and this sensitivity becomes milder at finite @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to check whether continuum - limit results can be obtained reliably by looking systematically at the dependence on the transverse lattice spacing @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the length of the box and @xmath13 the number of lattice points in the transverse direction .    *",
    "[ ii ] * _ longitudinal grid size @xmath17 : _   physical results should also not be contaminated by ultraviolet singularities in the longitudinal direction . to avoid this",
    ", we will use initial fluctuations with sufficiently small longitudinal wave - number @xmath18 ( @xmath18 is the fourier conjugate to the rapidity @xmath12 ) .",
    "we will confirm that there is no dependence on the longitudinal grid size @xmath17 or the longitudinal lattice spacing @xmath19 , at least until the longitudinal spectrum extends into the ultraviolet regions at very late time .",
    "* [ iii ] * _ magnitude @xmath20 of the seeds : _   in general the strength of the instability increases with the magnitude @xmath20 of the initial @xmath12-dependent perturbations .",
    "this dependence is found to be very simple until the unstable modes become large enough to be self - interacting : at moderate times , the finite-@xmath18 modes obey the linearized dynamics and their amplitudes grow linearly as @xmath20 increases .",
    "* [ iv ] * _ initial wave - number @xmath21 : _   the time evolution depends on the initial condition in the longitudinal direction , and in particular on the wave - number @xmath21 of the seeds .",
    "we will show that the instability produced by the smallest wave - number is defined to be an integer between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the lowest non - zero wave - number is thus @xmath24 . ]",
    "( @xmath25 ) is the fastest and strongest in a wide range of times .",
    "we will also confirm the dominance of linearity and the appreciable presence of residual non - linear effects by verifying that the result from an initial condition with multiple @xmath21 s can be approximated as the superposition of the results from initial conditions with single wave - numbers @xmath21 s .    in this paper , we report on numerical results about these dependences for the growing behavior at the late stage of the glasma evolution .",
    "these numerical results provide a pool of observations that we hope will help to understand the microscopic mechanisms that drive the glasma instabilities . in the section  [ sec : formulas ]",
    ", we recall the most important formulas for a lattice study of this problem . in the section  [ sec : bi ]",
    ", we briefly expose some results in the purely boost - invariant case .",
    "these are well - known results already , and merely serve as a check of our implementation . in the section  [ sec : notbi ]",
    ", we describe what happens when the glasma fields are perturbed by a rapidity - dependent seed , and we investigate thoroughly how the result depends on the parameters listed above .",
    "we explore the time evolution of the @xmath18-spectrum in the section  [ sec : lspectrum ] .",
    "finally , the section  [ sec : summary ] is devoted to a summary and outlook .",
    "in this section , we summarize our equations , with emphasis on the lattice specificities .",

    "this expression for the link variable is the most important one in order to establish the correspondence between the continuum and the lattice ( link - variable ) formulations . under a gauge transformation by @xmath30",

    "this is a very useful expression to study the continuum limit .",
    "the lattice spacing should be the longitudinal one , i.e.  @xmath35 , which is distinct from the transverse one @xmath36 , if the longitudinal direction is involved in the displacements @xmath37 or @xmath38 in the above formula .",
    "the canonical momenta in terms of link variables are expressed as @xmath39 here we note that in the above we already use variables made dimensionless by the transverse lattice spacing @xmath36 , and thus @xmath36 will never appear explicitly in our formula . because @xmath12 is a dimensionless number",
    ", @xmath35 does not bring any mass dimension unlike @xmath36 .",

    "we recall again that all variables including @xmath14 and @xmath49 above are dimensionless , and expressed in unit of the transverse spacing @xmath36 .",
    "one can make sure that these equations are equivalent to the ordinary equations of motion in the continuum limit , by using the approximate form  .",
    "the initial conditions are derived from the requirement of avoiding the singularity at the collision point .",
    "it is written in terms of @xmath50 , the classical solution of the mv model for a single color source ( the label @xmath51 indicates which of the two nuclei produces the corresponding field ) .",

    "then , the initial conditions are  @xcite ; @xmath60 \\ ; , \\label{eq : initial_e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] written here in the slightly simpler case of the su(2 ) color group .",
    "these discretized equations of motion and initial conditions completely define the numerical mv model .",
    "our conventions are mostly consistent with those of previous works , except for the fact that the field @xmath61 is not treated as an adjoint scalar - field variable but instead we also describe it in terms of a link variable @xmath62 .",
    "we note that our formulation is reduced to the conventional one with the adjoint scalar - field variable if we take @xmath35 to be sufficiently small .",
    "in addition , since our interest lies primarily in the qualitative behavior of the glasma instability , we disregard the color neutralization that has been imposed onto the mv model color sources in other works  @xcite .",
    "it is now straightforward to implement the numerical calculation for gauge - invariant observables such as the components of the energy - momentum tensor .",

    "in fact the energy density multiplied by the time , @xmath110 , saturates at a time @xmath111 ( which is sometimes called the formation time , i.e. the time at which partons are freed from the wave - function of the nuclei ) where the free - streaming expansion starts .",

    "although it is difficult to find any indication that the system indeed becomes isotropic and thermalized in our simulation , the confirmation of the kolmogorov - type spectra is a promising signal for the general tendency heading for thermalization .    there",
    "remain very interesting questions to be investigated in the future . in order to unveil the microscopic mechanism for the instability",
    ", it would be very useful to make approximations on the classical equations of motion in such a way that the analytical treatment could be feasible .",
    "for instance , as we have confirmed , the instability mostly lies in the linear regime as long as its magnitude specified by @xmath20 is small enough .",
    "therefore the linearization of the equations of motion in terms of fluctuating fields on top of the boost - invariant cgc background should correctly describe the instability in early times . in this work",
    "we did not exploit such a comparison between the numerical output and the analytical result from the linearized equations .",
    "this is because it is not quite efficient to linearize the equations of motion given in terms of the lattice variables .",
    "the linearization is of course possible , but it would eventually be reduced to similar calculations in the continuum formulation .",
    "then , it would make much more sense to make a comparison between the numerical and analytical results that are both formulated in the continuum variables .",
    "we have already executed test programs to make sure if the numerical results from the glasma simulations are consistent with each other , given they are written in terms of lattice and continuum variables .",
    "we will report on this analysis elsewhere .",
    "it is also an intriguing question to look for a link between kolmogorov s turbulent spectrum and the chaotic behavior generally seen in the solution of the classical yang - mills equations .",
    "this problem may have some relevance for a deeper understanding of the microscopic description of the entropy generating process and how the thermalization is achieved at all .",
    "the time evolution of the glasma and its physics contents deserve much more investigations in the future .",
    "we would like to thank kevin dusling , tuomas lappi , and raju venugopalan for discussions .",

    "<S> we extensively study the growing behavior of the energy and the pressure components depending on the space - time rapidity in the framework of the glasma , which describes the early - time dynamics in the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate the glasma solving the classical equations of motion in the su(2 ) yang - mills theory and systematically investigate the dependence of the glasma instability on the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that the transverse and longitudinal grid sizes in our simulation are large enough to handle cutoff effects under control . by comparing the numerical results from several initial conditions with different magnitudes of instability seed and also those with different wave - numbers for rapidity fluctuations , we clearly see that unstable modes dominantly grow up in the linear regime and we also confirm non - linear effects in the time evolution . </S>",
    "<S> to extract more detailed information on the evolving glasma , we decompose the energy into the components in terms of rapidity wave - numbers . </S>",
    "<S> we observe an energy flow from low wave - number modes into higher wave - number modes due to non - linearity in the equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the energy spectrum approaches an asymptotic scaling that is consistent with kolmogorov s power - law form even in the expanding system of the glasma .    and    color glass condensate , glasma , relativistic heavy - ion collision , instability , kolmogorov spectrum </S>"
