    "given an undirected graph @xmath0 with a set @xmath1 of vertices and an edge set @xmath2 , the bandwidth coloring problem ( bcp ) is to assign a color @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) to each vertex @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) such that for each edge @xmath7 the difference between the colors of vertices @xmath5 and @xmath8 must be larger than or equal to the associated edge weight @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "the objective of bcp is to minimize the number of the colors used , @xmath11 .",
    "it is obvious that bcp is a generalization of the classical vertex coloring problem ( vcp),which results in the case where @xmath12 for all distinct pairs @xmath13 .",
    "the bandwidth multicoloring problem ( bmcp ) is a generalization of bcp , where each vertex @xmath5 is associated with a positive integer @xmath14 and each edge @xmath7 is associated with an edge weight @xmath9 .",
    "bmcp aims to assign @xmath14 distinct colors from 1 to @xmath11 to each vertex @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , such that for each edge @xmath7 the difference between the colors of vertices @xmath5 and @xmath8 must be at least the associated edge weight @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath15 , the difference between any two colors of vertex @xmath5 must be at least @xmath16 , which is the weight of the loop edge of vertex @xmath5 .",
    "like bcp , bmcp aims to minimize the number of the colors used , @xmath11 .",
    "one can observe that bcp is a special case of bmcp with @xmath17 for all vertices .",
    "in addition to their theoretical significance as np - hard problems , bcp and bmcp have a number of relevant real - world applications .",
    "for example , the fixed spectrum frequency assignment problem ( fs - fap ) @xcite can be viewed as a simple variant of bcp and the minimum span frequency assignment problem ( ms - fap ) is equivalent to bmcp considered here @xcite .",
    "in addition , some other variants of bmcp have also been used to model the corresponding frequency assignment problems in the literature @xcite ( see @xcite for more details about the frequency assignment problems ) .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , bmcp can be converted into bcp by splitting each vertex @xmath5 into a clique with @xmath14 vertices , where each edge of the clique has an edge weight @xmath16 that corresponds to the weight of the loop edge of vertex @xmath5 in the original graph ( see @xcite for an example ) .",
    "the resulting new graph has @xmath18 vertices .",
    "thus , any approach for bcp can be applied to bmcp directly . for this reason ,",
    "we focus on solving bcp in this paper .",
    "a large number of solution approaches have been reported in the literature . in 1998 ,",
    "dorne and hao proposed a tabu search algorithm for the t - coloring problem and the set t - coloring problem which are a generalization of bcp and bmcp @xcite . in 2002 ,",
    "phan and skiena proposed a general heuristic @xcite , called discropt for solving the vertex coloring problem and bcp , and prestwich proposed a hybrid algorithm that combines a local search with constraint propagation for solving bcp and bmcp , called fcns @xcite .",
    "subsequently , an extended version of fcns was developed by the same author @xcite . in @xcite , lim et al .",
    "developed two hybrid algorithms for solving vcp and its generalizations . in @xcite , chiarandini",
    "investigate several stochastic local search algorithms for the set t - coloring problem . in 2008 ,",
    "malaguti and toth reported an effective evolutionary approach for bcp and bmcp @xcite . recently ,",
    "mart et al . developed several heuristic approaches for bcp using memory structures in both constructive and improvement methods @xcite . in a very recent work @xcite , lai and l developed a multistart iterated tabu search ( mits ) algorithm for bcp and bmcp .",
    "in addition , some other heuristic algorithms were also proposed in the literature to solve ms - fap which is equivalent to bmcp , such as tabu search @xcite , genetic algorithms @xcite , and constraint programming approaches @xcite .",
    "recently , path relinking ( pr ) @xcite has attracted special attention in the community of combinatorial optimization , and shows outstanding performances in solving a number of difficult problems , such as unconstrained binary quadratic optimization @xcite , multiple - level warehouse layout @xcite , and flow shop sequencing @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we devise a new pr algorithm for the bcp and bmcp problems , which integrates a tabu search ( ts ) algorithm ( for local optimization ) with the population based pr framework .",
    "the proposed pr algorithm is assessed on two sets of 66 benchmark instances commonly used in the literature and shows remarkable performances compared to the current best solution methods .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ pr ] , we describe in detail the pr algorithm proposed in this paper . in section [ results ] , we show our computational results compare them with several best performing algorithms from the literature . in section [ discussion ] , we investigate some key ingredients of the pr algorithm , before concluding the paper in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the pr algorithm presented in this paper is a hybrid population algorithm that combines path relinking and local search to achieve a desirable tradeoff between intensification and diversification .",
    "the effectiveness of the pr algorithm depends mainly on three components : the pr population scheme , the path relinking procedure , and the local search method .",
    "we explain in this section the ingredients of our proposed pr algorithm designed for bcp .",
    "bcp can be considered from the point of view of constraint satisfaction by solving a series of @xmath11-bcp problems aiming at searching for a @xmath11-coloring ( @xmath11 being fixed ) that satisfies all edge constraints .",
    "starting from a large enough initial @xmath11 , our algorithm seeks to solve the @xmath11-bcp problem , i.e. to find a legal @xmath11-coloring .",
    "a @xmath11-coloring is legal if all the edge constraints of bcp are satisfied and is illegal , otherwise .",
    "as soon as the @xmath11-bcp problem is solved for the current @xmath11 value , we set @xmath11 to @xmath19 and solve again the new @xmath11-bcp problem",
    ". the process is repeated until no legal @xmath11-coloring can be found .",
    "therefore , the presented pr algorithm only considers the @xmath11-bcp problem .",
    "in general , a combinatorial optimization problem can be represented as a 2-tuple @xmath20 , where @xmath21 represents the search space and @xmath22 represents the objective function defined on @xmath21 . as stated in @xcite , for the @xmath11-bcp problem , the search space @xmath21 can be defined as the set of all possible @xmath11-colorings , including legal and illegal @xmath11-colorings . it should be noted that the same search space is also used for the studies of vertex coloring problem in for instance @xcite .",
    "moreover , for a @xmath11-coloring , we define the objective function of the @xmath11-bcp problem as the summation of all constraint violations induced by the @xmath11-coloring .",
    "specifically , let @xmath23 be a @xmath11-coloring , the objective function @xmath24 used in this study is written as : @xmath25 where @xmath9 is the edge weight for edge @xmath26 , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively represent colors of vertices @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , a solution @xmath23 with @xmath29 corresponds to a legal @xmath11-coloring .",
    "as mentioned above , our pr algorithm falls into the class of population algorithms and consists of four main components : population initialization , local search method , path relinking procedure , and population update .",
    "algorithm [ algo_pr ] describes in detail the framework of our pr algorithm . in the algorithm ,",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively represent the best solution found so far and the worst solution in the population in terms of objective function value , @xmath32 is the set of solution pairs @xmath33 and is initially composed of all the possible solution pairs @xmath33 in the population .",
    "the pr algorithm starts with an initial population @xmath34 ( line 4 ) which includes @xmath35 different solutions , where each of them is randomly generated and then optimized by the tabu search procedure to reach a local optimum .",
    "subsequently , the algorithm enters a while loop ( lines 11 to 25 ) , and at each iteration a solution pair is randomly selected from @xmath32 , and then the path relinking procedure ( line 14 ) and tabu search procedure ( line 15 ) are applied to generate two new offspring solutions .",
    "more specifically , for the selected solution pair @xmath33 , two offspring solutions @xmath36 and @xmath37 are generated by building paths from the initial solution @xmath38 to the target solution @xmath39 as well as from @xmath39 to @xmath38 , and then @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively optimized by the tabu search procedure .",
    "after that , a population update criterion is used to decide whether the obtained solutions should be inserted into the population ( lines 19 to 20 ) .",
    "the @xmath32 is updated as follows .",
    "first , the solution pair @xmath33 is removed after it has been chosen from @xmath32 for the path relinking procedure ( line 13 ) .",
    "second , after the population update , once a reference solution @xmath36 replaces the worst solution @xmath31 in the population , all the solution pairs containing @xmath31 are removed from @xmath32 and all the solution pairs that can be generated by combining @xmath36 with other solutions in the population are added into @xmath32 ( lines 21 to 22 ) .",
    "the while loop ends when @xmath32 becomes empty , then the population is recreated ( lines 4 to 7 ) and the above while loop is repeated if the stopping condition is not satisfied .",
    "there are several stopping criteria that can be employed for the pr algorithm , such as the maximum number of iterations , the maximum number of iterations during which the best solution can not be improved , the maximum timeout limit , and so on . in this study ,",
    "our pr algorithm stops when a legal solution ( @xmath11-coloring ) is found or the timeout limit is reached .",
    "the pr algorithm presented in this paper has several specific features .",
    "first , each solution pair @xmath33 is used to generate two paths by the path relinking procedure : one is from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , the other is from @xmath39 to @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , each selected solution pair will generate two new offspring solutions by the path relinking procedure .",
    "second , when @xmath32 is empty , we rebuild the population while retaining the best solution @xmath40 in the new population ( lines 4 to 7 ) .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we describe in detail each main component of our pr algorithm .      from scratch ,",
    "an initial population is constructed as follows .",
    "we first generate @xmath41 random solutions , where each variable ( or vertex ) of each solution is assigned a random color from 1 to @xmath11 .",
    "then , for each generated solution , the tabu search method ( see section [ subsec_ts ] ) is used to optimize it to a local optimum . finally , we choose the first @xmath35 best solutions to form the initial population .    * input * : problem instance @xmath42 , the number of colors ( @xmath11 ) , the size of population ( @xmath35 ) * output * : the best @xmath11-coloring @xmath40 found and",
    "@xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 population_initialization(@xmath46 )  /@xmath47 section [ subsec_initialization_population ] @xmath47/ @xmath48 @xmath49",
    "@xmath50 @xmath51 randomly pick a solution pair @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 , @xmath55/@xmath47 section [ subsec_path_relinking_operator ] @xmath47/ @xmath56   /@xmath47 section [ subsec_ts ] @xmath47/ @xmath57 , @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61  /@xmath47 section [ subsec_pool_updating ] @xmath47/ perform the same steps from line 15 to line 23 for @xmath37      in @xcite , an effective tabu search ( ts ) algorithm is presented for the bcp and bmcp problems . in this work , we use this ts algorithm as our local optimization procedure .",
    "the main characteristics are as follows .",
    "the ts procedure operates in the same search space and objective function as defined in section [ sub_search_space ] . from a given solution ( i.e. , an illegal @xmath11-coloring )",
    ", it iteratively improves the current solution by following the `` critical one - move '' neighborhood . as such",
    ", a neighboring solution of the current @xmath11-coloring is obtained by changing the color of a conflicting vertex @xmath62 from its original color @xmath27 to another color @xmath28 ( @xmath63 ) ( denoted by the move @xmath64 ) . here ,",
    "a vertex is considered to be conflicting if at least one of the distance constraints associated with this vertex is violated .",
    "thus , it can easily be deduced that for a @xmath11-coloring @xmath23 with cost @xmath24 , the size of this neighborhood is bounded by @xmath65 . at each iteration of ts",
    ", a best authorized neighboring solution is chosen to replace the current solution and the corresponding move is recorded to the tabu list to prevent the reverse move from being selected during the next @xmath66 iterations ( @xmath66 is the tabu tenure ) . for a detailed description of the ts optimization procedure , the reader is refereed to @xcite .",
    "the relinking method is the core component of our pr algorithm , and its goal is to generate new solutions by creating paths between two high - quality solutions .",
    "the relinking method includes two main operations .",
    "the first one is to construct a path that connects two parent solutions , where the parent solutions located at the beginning and the end of the path are respectively called the initiating solution and the guiding solution , while the others are called intermediate solutions .",
    "the other operation is to choose one solution as the reference solution from the constructed path and apply the ts procedure to improve its quality .    to build a path between the initial and the guiding solutions ,",
    "there are generally two simple strategies that can be used , i.e. , the random strategy ( denoted by pr1 ) and the greedy strategy ( denoted by pr2 ) . in this study",
    ", we employ pr1 , since pr1 is superior to pr2 within the present framework according to our preliminary experiments .    the pseudo - code of these two strategies are described in algorithms [ algo_rk ] and [ algo_rk2 ] , where some important definitions are given as follows :    * @xmath67 : the set of variable indices that have different values in two solutions .",
    "* @xmath68 : the change in the objective function value when the current solution @xmath38 is changed by modifying its @xmath69th variable to transit from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "* @xmath70 : a variable set that stores the variables modified at each step throughout the transiting from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "* @xmath71 : a memory structure for updating @xmath68 in a fast manner .",

    "in addition , @xmath89 and @xmath93 correspond respectively to the guiding solution @xmath38 and the target solution @xmath39 , while the other solutions are intermediate solutions .",
    "the only difference between pr1 and pr2 lies in the way to select the variable @xmath69 from @xmath67 for generating the next solution on the path . in pr1 ,",
    "based on the current solution @xmath97 a random variable @xmath69 ( @xmath98 ) is chosen to generate the next solution @xmath99 , @xmath100 , whereas in pr2 a variable @xmath69 producing the best @xmath101 value is chosen .",
    "note that @xmath68 can be rapidly calculated at each step of the path relinking with the help of the dedicated memory structure @xmath71 @xcite , and this matrix is only initialized at the beginning of each relinking procedure and updated subsequently in a very fast manner during the relinking process .",
    "after the creation of a path , we choose one solution on this path such that the chosen solution is far enough from the initiating and target solutions and has a good objective function value @xcite .",
    "specifically , we construct a candidate solution list ( cls ) that consists of the path solutions having a distance of at least @xmath102 ( where @xmath103 is a value between 0 and 1.0 and @xmath104 is the hamming distance between the initiating and guiding solutions ) from both the initiating and guiding solutions , then the solution having the best objective value in csl is chosen as the reference solution which is further improved by tabu search .      to determine whether a reference solution should be inserted into the population and which solution in the population should be replaced , we use the following updating criterion . the reference solution replaces the worst solution in the population if it is not too close to any solution in the population and it is better than the worst solution in the population .",
    "two solutions are considered to be too close if the number of components that have different values is smaller than @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the number of vertices in the graph .",
    "two sets of benchmarks are considered in our experiments . the first set ( denotaed by bcp ) is composed of 33 instances and available in @xcite . the second set ( denotaed by bmcp )",
    "is composed of 33 larger instances , transformed from the bmcp instances .",
    "our algorithm was programmed in c and run on a cluster with 2.8 ghz cpu and 4 gb ram .",
    "table [ parameter_settings ] gives the descriptions and settings of the parameters used in our pr algorithm .",
    "for the first and second sets of benchmark instances , the timeout limits are set to 2 and 4 hours , respectively . for the majority of the tested instances",
    "the actual time to reach a legal @xmath11-coloring is generally much less than these time limits .",
    "given the stochastic nature of our pr algorithm , each instance with the given value of @xmath11 is independently solved 20 times .",
    ".settings of important parameters [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to check whether the results in table [ results_bmcp_instances ] can be further improved , we carry out the following additional experiment .",
    "first , we determine the smallest @xmath11 for which a legal @xmath11-coloring can be reached as follows : ( 1 ) the value of @xmath11 was first set to the best known one and then our pr algorithm searches for a legal @xmath11-coloring .",
    "( 2 ) once a legal @xmath11-coloring is found , we set @xmath11 to @xmath19 and run our pr algorithm again .",
    "( 3 ) step ( 2 ) is repeated until the value of @xmath11 can not be further improved during 10 consecutive runs of the pr algorithm , and the best result found is recorded as @xmath107 .",
    "second , to assess the performance of the pr algorithm for different values of @xmath11 on the improved instances , we run the pr algorithm independently 20 times for each @xmath11 from @xmath107 to @xmath108 ( where @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) .",
    "the computational results are summarized in table [ further_bcmp_instances ] with the same statistics as in table [ results_bmcp_instances ] .",
    "the stopping condition is identical to that used in section [ bmcp ] for each run of the pr algorithm .",
    "these tests show that our pr algorithm is able to improve the best known results listed in table [ results_bmcp_instances ] for 14 out of 33 instances , and the improvement is impressive for some instances , such as geom120a which is solved by using 10 fewer colors than the current best solution .",
    "tables [ results_bmcp_instances ] and [ further_bcmp_instances ] disclose that our pr algorithm improved or matched the previous best known results for all the bmcp instances .    on the other hand",
    ", one can observe that for most instances , a smaller value of @xmath11 usually corresponds to a lower success rate and a longer average computing time for detecting a legal @xmath11-coloring .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that finding a legal @xmath11-coloring is much more difficult when @xmath11 is smaller than the best known value .",
    "however , the average computing time is still acceptable for most instances .",
    "we now turn our attention to analyzing and discussing several important features of our algorithm , including the ts algorithm and the relinking procedure .      in this section ,",
    "we assess the role of the ts algorithm within the pr algorithm . for this purpose",
    "the following experiment was conducted on a difficult instance named geom120 of bmcp with @xmath111 .",
    "first , we ran our pr algorithm and separately recorded the best and average objective function values in the population as a function of the computation time .",
    "then , we disabled the ts algorithm and replaced it by the steepest descent ( sd ) method .",
    "we ran this weakened pr algorithm and again recorded the best and average objective function values as a function of computation time .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ ts_vs_sd ] .",
    "note that all results are based on the average of 5 independent runs .",
    "figure [ ts_vs_sd ] demonstrates that using the ts algorithm within the pr algorithm yields much better results than using sd in terms of both the best objective function value and the average objective function value .",
    "this experiment highlights the importance of the ts method for the performance of the proposed pr algorithm .",
    "it is well known that heuristic algorithms usually depend on the settings of parameters used .",
    "therefore , it is meaningful to analyze the influence of the parameters on the performance of the algorithm . in this study , we only discuss one key parameter , i.e. , the depth @xmath112 of ts , since it may normally be expected to have a significant influence on the performance of the pr algorithm .    in most cases , a larger value of @xmath112 endows the ts method with a stronger local searching ability .",
    "however , a larger @xmath112 also entails a larger computational effort .",
    "therefore , the setting of @xmath112 is a critical factor in determining a favorable tradeoff between solution speed and quality . to assess the influence of @xmath112 on the performance of the algorithm , we carried out experiments on the instance geom120 of bmcp with @xmath111 using different values of @xmath112 , i.e. , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 , where the stopping condition of the algorithm is the maximum number of generations excluding the population initialization .",
    "( we used 3000 generations here . ) the evolution of the best objective function value in the population and the computing time with the number of generations are separately plotted in figure [ fig_alpha ] for each value of @xmath112 , where the results are based on the average of 5 runs .",
    "one can observe that the pr algorithms with the indicated values of @xmath112 have quite similar search behaviors , but a larger @xmath112 value corresponds to a longer computational time .",
    "in fact , the pr algorithm with @xmath116 and with @xmath117 has a success rate of 5/5 for finding the best objective function value ( @xmath118 ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath117 produces a much longer computing time than @xmath116 , indicating that a value of @xmath112 larger than @xmath119 will lead to a waste of computational power , and a relatively small value of @xmath112 like @xmath120 suffices to yield a high performance for the present pr algorithm .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite and @xcite , there are several relinking methods that can be used to generate new offspring solutions , including deterministic methods and randomized methods . pr1 and pr2 used in this study are relatively easy to implement and respectively belong to the classes of the randomized methods and the deterministic methods .    in order to verify whether the relinking procedure plays an important role for the overall performance of our pr algorithm",
    ", we compare the pr1 and pr2 relinking procedures with additional experiments .",
    "we carry out the experiments using the proposed algorithms respectively with the pr1 or pr2 relinking procedure , based on two difficult instances , i.e. , geom70 and geom120 of bmcp , and all computational results are recorded based on the average of 5 runs of the corresponding pr algorithm .",
    "the objective function values of solutions generated by pr1 and pr2 are compared for the two instances in the sub - figures ( a ) and ( c ) of figure [ pr1_vs_pr2 ] , and the evolutions of the best objective function values in the population with the number of local searches are also plotted in the sub - figures ( b ) and ( d ) of figure [ pr1_vs_pr2 ] .",
    "one can observe from the figures that for the tested instances the greedy pr2 method is able to produce very good offspring solutions in terms of objective function value compared with pr1 .",
    "however , the pr algorithm with pr1 ( randomized relinking method ) yields a better performance than the algorithm with pr2 ( deterministic relinking method ) .",
    "therefore , it can be considered that the randomized relinking method is more appropriate than the deterministic relinking method for the tested instances .",
    "intuitively , the search with the greedy relinking method combining with the greedy population updating strategy has troubles to maintain a desirable population diversity as the search progresses . on the other hand ,",
    "the pr with the randomized relinking method reaches a better balance between diversification and intensification , thus resulting in a stronger searching ability .",
    "in this paper , we presented a pr algorithm for solving the bandwidth coloring problem and the bandwidth multicoloring problem by incorporating a tabu search algorithm with a path relinking procedure .",
    "we tested the proposed algorithm on 66 benchmark instances commonly used in the literature .",
    "computational results show that our algorithm is highly competitive in comparison with the best performing algorithms in the literature . in particular , it improved best known results for 15 out of 66 instances and the improvement is very significant for several bmcp cases , yielding solutions with up to 10 fewer colors .",
    "we studied some essential ingredients of the proposed algorithm which shed light on the following points .",
    "first , the ts procedure is particularly appropriate as a local optimization method for our pr algorithm .",
    "second , the random relinking procedure ( pr1 ) method is generally more effective than the greedy relinking procedure ( pr2 ) within the present pr framework for the bcp and bmcp problems .",
    "third , the search ability of the present pr algorithm is not very sensitive to the depth @xmath112 of the tabu search procedure .",
