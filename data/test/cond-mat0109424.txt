    "a variety of critical phenomena in nature arise due to the development of long range correlations or long range order at a finite temperature . in the critical region quantities",
    "are characterized by scaling relations that are universal and depend only on the symmetries involved .",
    "the basis for this universality is the renormalization group analysis @xcite .",
    "a number of universal properties have been confirmed with great precision by numerically studying similar symmetry breaking patterns in different microscopic models .",
    "however , almost all known examples involve bosonic variables in the form of either classical @xcite or quantum spins @xcite at the microscopic level . on the other hand ,",
    "most interesting physical systems in condensed matter and high energy physics fundamentally involve fermionic particles interacting with each other through gauge fields .",
    "unfortunately , calculations confirming the predictions of universality in such systems are rather limited and crude . in particular precise calculations substantiating the universal critical behavior in superconducting materials or strongly interacting matter can not be found .",
    "the essential difficulty is that the only known approach to study this subject is through numerical simulations . in the case of fermi systems one",
    "has to be clever and overcome the so called sign problem which makes designing algorithms difficult . even in cases",
    "where the sign problem can be solved by integrating out fermions , the conventional algorithms often suffer from critical slowing down .",
    "these difficulties have restricted the calculations to small system sizes which are not sufficient to accurately determine the scaling behavior near a phase transition .",
    "the lack of efficient numerical methods available for fermi systems has created some interesting controversies .",
    "it is well known that long range fermionic correlations can arise at zero temperature and can lead to novel universality classes @xcite . on the other hand it is believed that the long range degrees of freedom near a finite temperature phase transition should be well described by bosonic degrees of freedom , the reason being that fermions acquire a mass proportional to the temperature @xmath5 and hence decouple from the critical behavior . however , a few years ago this conventional wisdom was questioned based on a large @xmath6 calculation and further substantiated by numerical simulations @xcite at smaller @xmath6 .",
    "it was suggested that the composite nature of the order parameter in fermionic systems may cause deviations from conventional universality .",
    "more recently a detailed study of the transition revealed that the deviations could be related to the artifacts of the large @xmath6 limit @xcite .",
    "thus , although the controversy for the moment appears settled the lesson one learns is that universality classes arising in fermionic theories can only be confirmed through precise non - perturbative calculations .",
    "recently a new method called the _ meron - cluster algorithm _ has emerged as a very efficient alternative to solve certain classes of fermionic models @xcite .",
    "it is based on the well known loop cluster algorithm for quantum spin models @xcite and does not suffer from critical slowing down . using the concept of a meron - cluster",
    "it solves the sign problem @xcite .",
    "this novel method has lead to the first successful determination of the critical behavior near a three dimensional ising transition in a fermionic model , again confirming the predictions of universality @xcite .",
    "the calculations of @xcite mentioned earlier , had reproduced the two dimensional ising universality class from large ( even ) @xmath6 fermionic systems .",
    "this has now been extended to @xmath7 fermions using a meron - cluster method @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , until now no one has been able to check the universality arguments with precision beyond the ising universality class starting from a microscopic fermionic model . in this letter",
    "we present the first results from a meron - cluster algorithm which confirms that the critical behavior near a finite temperature phase transition in a model consisting of fermions can be described by the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) universality class@xcite .",
    "the importance of the kt universality class is well known .",
    "a variety of finite temperature phase transitions that arise in many two dimensional condensed matter systems involving phenomena like magnetism , superconductivity and superfluidity are expected to be described by this class .",
    "for example the superfluid transition in he@xmath8 occurs due to a condensation of helium atoms which in reality are tightly bound objects of fermionic constituents .",
    "similarly the superconducting transition in high @xmath9 materials is expected to occur due to a condensation of electron pairs .",
    "both these transitions are expected to follow the predictions of kosterlitz and thouless and are related to a @xmath10 particle number symmetry . although kt universality has been studied extensively using spin systems , it has been difficult to perform precise calculations confirming that a kt universality can arise starting from a microscopic fermionic hamiltonian .",
    "a simple model that has been studied in this context by conventional monte carlo methods is the attractive hubbard model @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the inefficiencies of the algorithm have limited the size of the systems that could be studied .",
    "this coupled with the fact that the model has an unusually low critical temperature and exponentially diverging correlation length have not yielded any quantitative information about the universality class of the transition @xcite .",
    "given the proliferation of transitions in nature that are conventionally expected to be described by the kt universality class , the fact that at a microscopic level most of the systems are always made up of fermionic degrees of freedom and the controversy discussed above regarding deviations from universality in fermi systems , it is important to find precise calculations that either confirm our expectations or contradict them .",
    "the fermionic system we study is a new extension of the attractive hubbard hamilton operator in two dimensions and is given by @xmath11 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ -&4&\\sum_x\\ ; \\;\\left({n_{x,\\uparrow}}-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left({n_{x,\\downarrow}}-\\frac{1}{2}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{hubbh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath12 represents the nearest neighbor sites of a square lattice of size @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "although the hamilton operator has many terms , it is easy to check that it is invariant under @xmath15 spin transformations and conserves @xmath10 fermion number . further , there is an on - site attraction between electrons of opposite spins like in the attractive hubbard model .",
    "as we will see , below a critical temperature transportation of fermion number through the bulk becomes easy , leading to superconductivity ( or more appropriately superfluidity since the symmetry is not gauged in the model ) . in higher dimensions",
    "this is related to the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath10 fermion number symmetry . in two dimensions ,",
    "since this is forbidden due to the mermin - wagner theorem , superconductivity occurs due to the kt phenomena .",
    "the essential feature of the model that makes it useful is the fact that its partition function can be written in terms of the statistical mechanics of closed loops with positive weights @xcite . to see this we start with a discrete imaginary time approximation of the partition function @xmath16 \\;\\cong\\ ;   \\mathrm{tr}\\left [ ( \\prod_{i=1}^4 [ 1 - \\varepsilon\\ ; h_i])^m\\right ]    \\label{pf}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is a convenient reorganization of the interactions present in the hamiltonian .",
    "it is then possible to rewrite the path integral in terms of closed loops with @xmath19}\\ ; w[b ] \\;\\;\\overline{\\mathrm{sign}}[b]\\ ] ] where @xmath20 $ ] is a configuration of bonds linking neighboring sites which form closed loop clusters of sites .",
    "the magnitude of the boltzmann weight is @xmath21 > 0 $ ] .",
    "the fermion permutation sign is encoded in the topology of the loops .",
    "when a configuration contains loops of certain topology , referred to as _ merons _",
    ", then @xmath22 = 0 $ ] .",
    "if there are no meron loops in a configuration then @xmath22 = 2^{n_{\\cal c}}$ ] where @xmath23 is the number of loop clusters in the configuration .",
    "this novel representation of the partition function makes the model computationally tractable .",
    "more details on the meron - cluster formulation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the approximate partition function given in eq .",
    "( [ pf ] ) becomes exact in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "although this continuous time limit can be taken @xcite , for simplicity the results presented here are obtained by fixing @xmath25 . in the study of finite temperature critical behavior",
    "a sufficiently large but finite @xmath26 is acceptable .",
    "this is due to the fact that critical dynamics arise from large spatial sizes and the discrete nature of the temporal direction only effects non - universal quantities .",
    "the two dimensional universal critical behavior near @xmath9 remains unaffected .",
    "the simplest observable relevant to superconductivity is the pair susceptibility which we define as @xmath27\\ ] ] with @xmath28 the pair creation and @xmath29 the pair annihilation operators .",
    "the susceptibility contains information about the condensation of electron pairs which are the on - site component of cooper pairs in the bcs approach .",
    "a formula for the susceptibility in terms of loop clusters is easy to construct using the results of @xcite . in the present case , as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the susceptibility is proportional to the sum over the square of the size of certain clusters depending on the number of meron clusters in the configuration .    0.3 in     pair susceptibility as a function of @xmath30.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in figure [ psus ] we show results for the pair susceptibility as a function of spatial size @xmath30 .",
    "a state with quasi - long range correlations can be seen as a divergence in the susceptibility .",
    "typically , for temperatures above the superconducting transition temperature @xmath9 , the pair susceptibility should reach a constant for large enough volumes .",
    "this can be seen for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , although in the latter case lattices of size @xmath33 are necessary to see the saturation suggesting that the correlation lengths may be on the order of @xmath34 lattice units .",
    "this dramatic change in the correlation length between @xmath31 and @xmath32 is consistent with a kosterlitz - thouless prediction that it should diverge as @xmath35 close to the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a fit to a power law over the range @xmath36 is also poor at @xmath32 .",
    "below @xmath9 the susceptibility should diverge as @xmath37 with the critical exponent @xmath38 starting at @xmath39 at @xmath9 and going down to 0 as @xmath5 approaches zero .",
    "the exact formula has a logarithmic correction to the power law which is small and can not be accurately determined with reasonable size lattices so we ignore it here .",
    "this continuous change in the power is also clearly visible .",
    "we find that @xmath40 is @xmath41 at @xmath42 and @xmath43 at @xmath44 .",
    "the fits to a power law are extremely good for both these temperatures over the entire range of @xmath30 .    0.3 in     comparison between @xmath45 and @xmath46 as a function of @xmath5.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "although the pair susceptibility alone is sufficient to test for the kosterlitz - thouless predictions , there could always be a lingering doubt whether the power law fits would fail when one goes to much larger lattices .",
    "for example if we only had data for @xmath47 , a power law fit could even work well for @xmath32 when the error bars are sufficiently large .",
    "larger lattices were crucial to determine that the power law was not a good fit in that case . in order to alleviate such worries we looked at the winding number susceptibility which we define as @xmath48 where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is the total number of fermions winding around the boundary in the x ( y ) direction .",
    "this quantity is very useful in measuring @xmath9 and has been used in bosonic systems @xcite .",
    "although it is a difficult quantity to measure with conventional algorithms , it is relatively easy in the meron - cluster approach showing the power of the new method .",
    "further , we know its finite size scaling form to be @xmath51 with @xmath52 @xcite . it can be shown that for @xmath53 in the @xmath54 limit @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath56 jumps to the universal number @xmath57 from @xmath58 is another well known feature of the kt phenomena and can be used to determine @xmath9 . since @xmath45 can be determined from the scaling of the pair susceptibility one can combine it with the measurement of @xmath59 below @xmath9 to check for consistency in the kt universality class .",
    "figure [ wnsus ] compares @xmath60 obtained by extrapolating the values of the winding number susceptibility to the infinite volume limit using the formula ( [ fsshm ] ) and @xmath45 obtained from the finite size scaling of the pairing susceptibility , as a function of temperature .",
    "clearly the results are in excellent agreement with the predictions for a kt phase transition .",
    "this work can be extended in several directions .",
    "one interesting problem in condensed matter physics is to understand how disorder effects superconductivity .",
    "it is predicted that at zero temperature as the disorder is increased the system undergoes a quantum phase transition to an insulating phase@xcite .",
    "if this is indeed the case , it would be interesting to understand the underlying critical behavior starting from a fermionic theory .",
    "previous studies have used the attractive hubbard model as the starting point @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the model studied here is perhaps a better alternative since the meron - cluster algorithms could turn out to be more efficient in such a study .",
    "many other fermionic models with continuous symmetries and applications in condensed matter , nuclear and high energy physics can be studied with meron - cluster algorithms .",
    "a systematic approach has been outlined in @xcite .",
    "in particular it has also been shown that in certain regions of the parameter space some repulsive hubbard - type models with a non - zero chemical potential can be solved with meron - cluster techniques .",
    "whether there is d - wave superconductivity in these models is an open question .",
    "a common feature of these new models is that they appear to be more complicated .",
    "however since we have algorithms for them which give a computational advantage , they may still produce the clearest results .",
    "it is a common practice to work with models that are the easiest to solve ( numerically in this case ) to help understand complicated physical systems .",
    "once the basic phenomena is understood one can then attempt more difficult models to explore the robustness and variations in the details of the underlying physics .",
    "we thank uwe - jens wiese and harold baranger for many fruitful discussions .",
    "we also thank xincheng xie and richard scalettar for clarifications about the physics of the hubbard model .",
