    "an optical lattice is a crystal structure of off - resonant laser light , wherein atoms are trapped due to the optical dipole force .",

    "the periodic potential constitutes an ideal setting for realizing a wide range of condensed matter phenomena such as the superfluid to mott insulator transition  @xcite .",
    "likewise controlled atomic collisions in an optical lattice potential is a promising approach to implement quantum gate operations  @xcite .    in the context of ultracold atomic collisions",
    "a feshbach resonance arises , when a bound state of a closed scattering channel is coupled to the scattering continuum in the entrance channel  @xcite . in an applied magnetic field",
    "the separated atoms are described by eigenstates of the hyperfine and zeeman - hamiltonian , and the coupling between the different channels is a result of the atomic interaction , which is not diagonal in the hyperfine basis .",
    "the position of the resonance is tunable by varying the strength of the applied magnetic field , since the open and closed channels have different magnetic moments , and therefore experience different zeeman shifts .",
    "when the closed channel bound state is tuned to be degenerate with the colliding atoms in the entrance channel the scattering cross section is resonantly enhanced . a feshbach resonance may thus be used to regulate the atomic interactions , which in the ultracold regime is characterized entirely by the @xmath0-wave scattering length .",
    "in addition , since the feshbach resonance provides an adiabatic connection between bound dimer states and the continuum , a pair of unbound atoms may be converted into a molecule by slowly ramping the magnetic field across the resonance position .    to study two - particle physics on a lattice experimentally",

    "this prepares a state with at most two atoms in each lattice well , since sites with more than two atoms are eliminated by inelastic collisions .",

    "these are defined from the left and right asymptotic form of the wavefunction @xmath76 by comparing with ( [ psi_e_bg_asymp ] ) it follows that the transmission amplitude is @xmath77 , while the reflection amplitude coincides with the scattering amplitude , @xmath78 .",
    "the resulting transmission probability is @xmath79 as one might expect , the transmission vanishes in the limit where @xmath80 , and approaches unity as the strength of the on - site interaction is diminished . as usual , the reflection coefficient is @xmath81 , which is unity at the edges of the band , where propagation ceases .",
    "the minimum value of the reflection probability , @xmath82 , is attained in the middle of the band , @xmath27 .",
    "we emphasize that the transmission is independent of the sign of the interaction .",
    "this is a special property of the delta - function potential .    as usual the scattering amplitude",
    "may also be related to the phase shift , @xmath83 , of the scattered wave . in one dimension",
    "the relation is  @xcite @xmath84 in general there will be two partial waves , corresponding to even and odd solutions of the relative motion problem . for the delta - function interaction",
    "the odd partial wave has vanishing phase shift due to symmetry , and the reflection and transmission probabilities are then given by @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "the preceding derivation of the one - dimensional scattering in the lattice assumed that the two colliding atoms are distinguishable .",
    "if the collision involves identical bosons or fermions the scattering state @xmath87 must be an even or an odd function of the separation @xmath88 , respectively , to make the wavefunction either symmetric or anti - symmetric under interchange of the two atoms . for fermionic atoms in the same internal state",
    "this implies that the wavefunction vanishes for @xmath89 and the contact interaction does not produce any scattering .    for identical bosons",
    "the properly symmetrized scattering state may be written as @xmath90 when identical particles collide in one dimension the transmission and reflection coefficients have no meaning , since the incoming and outgoing fluxes are identical , however the scattered wave still experiences a phase shift given by ( [ eq : f_and_delta ] ) . even though the transmission profile calculated above",
    "does not play a role in the scattering of identical bosons , it may nonetheless be mapped out spectroscopically .",
    "consider transitions from a deeper bound state @xmath91 in the molecule to an energy eigenstate inside the band induced by applied rf- or photodissociation fields , which are described by some transition operator @xmath92 .",
    "if the initial state is well localized with respect to the lattice spacing , such dissociative transitions towards the state ( [ psi_bg_sym ] ) occur with a probability @xmath93 , obtained above .      when the relative quasi - momentum approaches the center or the edges of the brillouin zone , the two - particle energies @xmath94 tend to @xmath95 and the scattering amplitude attains a limiting form @xmath96 with @xmath97 at the bottom of the band and @xmath98 at the top of the band .",
    "these limits allow a natural definition of a generalized one - dimensional scattering length in the lattice @xmath99 from the limit @xmath100^{-1}$ ] of the scattering amplitude as @xmath101  @xcite .",
    "an equivalent definition is through the derivative of the phase shift with respect to the relative momentum @xmath102 in analogy with the usual free space scattering in three dimensions .",
    "our lattice scattering length is a generalization of the usual concept , in that it is defined for collision energies at both the lower _ and _ the upper edge of the continuum .",
    "the sign of @xmath103 at the upper edge of the continuum is a convention , which will be justified for the two - channel case below .",
    "our generalized scattering length depends on the center of mass motion of the pair , which is a crucial feature in the lattice , especially when we discuss the two - channel case below .    for @xmath104 a bound state",
    "is situated below the continuum , making @xmath103 positive as expected . in this case",
    "the pole of ( [ f_bg_lim ] ) lies along the positive imaginary axis , @xmath105 , and the analytic continuation of the plane wave @xmath106 is the dying exponential of the bound state .",
    "conversely , for a repulsively bound pair state lying above the continuum , @xmath107 , and @xmath103 is negative .",
    "the pole of the scattering amplitude is then at @xmath108 , corresponding to a wave function decaying exponentially with the separation between the two atoms and a phase factor @xmath109 , which alternates between @xmath110 and @xmath111 from one lattice site to the next , in accordance with the behavior of the green s function for the relative motion at @xmath112 ( [ g0_z_out ] ) .    as @xmath113 the scattering length diverges , and the bound state approaches the edge of the continuum . our intuition from scattering theory in three dimensions about the relation between weakly bound states and the scattering length thus holds both below and above the continuum band",
    "however , since @xmath42 is proportional to the free space background scattering length , @xmath114 , the generalized one - dimensional scattering length and its three - dimensional equivalent are inversely related  @xcite .",
    "we now consider scattering in the presence of a feshbach resonance mixing the entrance channel with an energetically closed channel through a coupling , @xmath115 .",
    "this gives rise to a set of two coupled equations for the relative motion of an atom pair    @xmath116    @xmath117    due to the large splitting between the bound states in the closed channel the resonance physics is faithfully represented by considering only a single bound state , the resonance state @xmath118 , of @xmath119 with an energy @xmath120 with respect to the center of the open channel band .",
    "this amounts to a single - pole approximation for the closed channel green s function @xmath121 the resonance state energy @xmath120 is composed , in part , of the free space resonance energy @xmath122 , which is linearly tunable with an applied magnetic field , due to the difference @xmath123 between the separated atoms and the closed channel magnetic moments , and , in part , of the displacement of the closed channel relative to the open channel bloch band as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : energydiagram ] . at all magnetic field strengths",
    "we take the zero of energy to be the center of the open channel continuum band . in free space",
    "the bare resonance energy can be related to the magnetic field position of the zero energy resonance , @xmath124 , as outlined in appendix  [ resonance_shift ] .",
    "is the energy of @xmath125 relative to the open channel threshold . applying an optical lattice changes the position of the open and closed channel by @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively , where @xmath128 is the average atomic energy and @xmath129 is the molecular spectrum of the first bloch band both along direction @xmath91 .",
    "note that the position of the open channel thresholds in the lattice depends on the quasi - momentum , @xmath38 , and therefore we choose @xmath27 to be the center of the open channel band .",
    "hence , the thresholds are located at @xmath95 . the difference in energy between the closed channel bound state and the center of the open channel band in the presence of the lattice is @xmath130 . ]    as a function of continuous position variables the longitudinal lattice potential for each atom is @xmath131 with @xmath132 , and therefore the combined lattice potential for a pair of atoms in the resonance state is @xmath133 where we have introduced the center of mass , @xmath134 , and relative , @xmath135 , coordinates .",
    "since the size of the closed channel bound state is much smaller than the lattice spacing , we may consider the limit of @xmath136 for this state .",
    "consequently , the resonant state has a center of mass motion corresponding to a lattice potential twice as deep as that governing the motion of the individual atoms , while its mass is the sum of the two atomic masses .",
    "this leads to a tunneling rate for the resonant state , @xmath137 , which is much reduced in comparison with the rate at which the free atoms tunnel through the lattice , @xmath138 .",
    "this bare molecular tunneling leads to a modulation of the resonance energy with the center of mass momentum of the pair , which we may parametrize as @xmath139 the band averaged resonance energy , @xmath140 , incorporates the relative energy shifts of the atomic and molecular bands in the lattice .      with the explicit expression for the closed channel green s function ( [ g_cl_approx ] ) the closed channel part of the scattering problem ( [ coupled_eq2 ] )",
    "may be solved formally : @xmath141 where we have introduced a coupling matrix element , @xmath142 , incorporating the structure of the resonance state . for a typical resonance in alkali collisions",
    "the coupling arises due to the difference between the triplet and singlet molecular potentials , and it is therefore inherently of short range compared with the lattice spacing .",

    "the lattice potential facilitates repulsively bound pair states in the gap between the two - particle bloch bands , and near a feshbach resonance a further class of exotic bound states may be created , which are only stable when their center of mass momentum exceeds a critical value , thus enabling us to tune the feshbach physics by controlling the molecular motion . ignoring the small modulation of the resonance energy due to tunneling of the bare molecules , the feshbach molecules are stable bound states of the system if their center of mass quasi - momentum in the first brillouin zone satisfies @xmath362 , where @xmath363",
    "if @xmath364 the pair state lies inside the continuum and decays with a rate @xmath162 , which we have determined analytically . for magnetic fields such that @xmath365 the feshbach molecules are stable for all @xmath38 . note that while the decay rate near threshold is proportional to the density of states , which diverges at the band edges , @xmath162 goes continuously to zero as @xmath310 approaches the edge of the continuum , since the overlap between the bare resonance state and the open channel continuum states is suppressed due to the background interactions in the open channel .",
    "an additional effect of the background interactions is to shift and modify the resonance profile . with a non - zero onsite interaction @xmath42 the position of the resonance",
    "is shifted away from the bare resonance energy @xmath120 , and the transmission of atoms in the open channel is described by a fano profile , with a shape determined by the energy dependent shift and width of the resonance .",
    "the energy dependence is most pronounced near the band edges , where the coupling to the continuum is strongest .",
    "this gives rise to threshold effects , when the resonance energy is tuned close to the band edge , as evidenced e.g. in the double peak structure of the molecule spectral function .",
    "we have outlined how the energy dependence of the scattering can be mapped out spectroscopically by inducing dissociative transitions from molecular bound states to two - particle scattering states inside the band .    from the expansion of the scattering amplitude as the collision",
    "energy approaches the band edges we have defined a generalized scattering length , which exhibits a feshbach resonance at both the lower and the upper threshold of the continuum .",
    "the diverging scattering length coincides with the appearance / disappearance of the feshbach bound state . in the limit of a deep lattice potential",
    "the lowest bloch band narrows , and these two resonances coalesce .",
    "since the bare molecules and the entrance channel atoms experience different lattice induced energy offsets , the position of both the upper and the lower threshold feshbach resonance is shifted relative to the position of the feshbach resonance in free space . for the specific resonance we have considered here",
    ", this shift exceeds the width of the resonance .",
    "for the interaction between the atoms in the open channel we assume that @xmath41 is a contact potential of strength @xmath366 , where @xmath367 is the ( free space ) background scattering length .",
    "therefore the on - site interaction between a pair of atoms in bands @xmath12 and @xmath1 becomes @xmath368 ^ 4        \\nonumber \\\\      & & \\times\\int dx_3 \\ , \\big [ w_{n0}^\\parallel(x_3)w_{m0}^\\parallel(x_3 )      \\big]^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the assumption that only the lowest band in the transverse lattice is occupied .",
    "since all lattice wells are identical , the integrals can be performed over wannier functions centered on any site .",
    "the coupling to the closed channel is of short range , since it is proportional to the difference between the atomic triplet and singlet potentials , which have the same long range form  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the closed channel bound state has a size ( typically tens of  ) , which is small compared with the lattice spacing ( hundreds of nm ) .",
    "we thus assume a purely on - site coupling , which in free space would couple molecular and atomic plane wave states with a strength @xmath369 . here",
    "@xmath123 is the difference between the closed and open channel magnetic moments and @xmath370 is the magnetic field width of the feshbach resonance in the absence of the lattice . in the discrete lattice model this results in the matrix element @xmath371 for the coupling of a pair of atoms in bands @xmath12 and @xmath1 to a bare molecule in band @xmath372 .",
    "the matrix elements are zero whenever @xmath373 is even due to parity of the wannier functions .",
    "a molecule experiences twice as deep a lattice as the atoms , see eq .",
    "( [ v_lat_mol ] ) , and has twice the atomic mass . consequently",
    ", separate wannier functions , @xmath374 , have to be calculated for the center of mass motion of the resonance state .    with the exception of sec .",
