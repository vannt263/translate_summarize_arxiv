    "clusters of galaxies have long been observed to contain an over - density of low - luminosity galaxies relative to brighter systems in comparison to the field ( e.g. , binggeli , sandage & tammann 1988 ; ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "this naturally includes observing a higher number of galaxies at the faint end of the luminosity function ( lf ) , resulting in a steeper faint - end power - law and schechter function slopes ( e.g. , trentham 1998 ) .",
    "this has led to the idea that the luminosity function of clusters is fundamentally different than the field lf , and that the galaxy formation process changes in different environments ( e.g. , binggeli et al . 1988 ) .",
    "galaxy cluster lfs can be altered by galaxy evolutionary effects , as we now known that the bright end of the lfs of groups and clusters are affected by merging events ( e.g. , dressler et al .",
    "1997 ; jones et al . 2000 ) .",
    "faint low - mass galaxies are however usually spared a merging fate as their low - masses saves them from dynamical friction effects .",
    "a steeper lf can however be produced by creating new dwarfs or low - mass galaxies from higher mass systems due to the removal of mass .",
    "the processes of creating low - luminosity galaxies from more luminous ones has not generally been considered in terms of its effect on the observed lfs of clusters .",
    "recent observational results suggest that a significant fraction of low - mass cluster galaxies ( lmcgs ) were not part of the initial cluster luminosity or mass function but were formed later possibly through the dynamical stripping of higher mass galaxies ( e.g. , gallagher , conselice & wyse 2001 ; conselice , gallagher , & wyse 2002a , b ) .",
    "evidence for this includes : kinematic information suggesting that some dwarf ellipticals / spheroidals were accreted into clusters during the last few gyrs ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2001 ; drinkwater et al .",
    "2001 ) and metal rich stellar populations in low - mass galaxies ( e.g. , adami et al .",
    "2000 ; rakos et al . 2001 ; conselice et al .",
    "2002b ) suggesting that lmcgs are possibly the remnants of stripped massive systems ( conselice et al .",
    "2002b ) .",
    "some low - mass cluster galaxies however have properties , such as low metallicity stellar populations , that suggest they originally formed with the cluster ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2001 ; conselice et al .",
    "low - mass cluster galaxies are therefore a combination of at least two populations with possibly different evolutionary histories ; one put into place during cluster formation as predicted in cdm models ( e.g. , nagamine et al .",
    "2001a ) and the other from evolved systems that formed after the cluster itself , possibly through tidal mechanisms such as harassment ( e.g. , moore et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this letter explores the implications of this later scenario for cluster luminosity functions , and how cluster luminosity functions could be derived from a universal initial galaxy mass function .",
    "the cosmology h@xmath2 = 70 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath4 = 0.7 , and @xmath4 = 0.3 , is used throughout this letter .",

    "conselice et al .",
    "( 2002a , b ) suggest that in the central @xmath6 arcmin@xmath7 of abell  0426 the low - mass galaxy systems have a broad range of colors , which we arbitrarily separate into a red and blue population .",
    "the separation of low - mass systems in abell  0426 from background systems is discussed in detail in conselice et al .",
    "( 2002a ) . to distinguish low - mass cluster members from background galaxies , conselice et al .",
    "( 2002a ) used morphological , color , size , surface brightness and magnitude cuts .",
    "figure  1 shows the color - magnitude diagram of the galaxies identified in the center of abell  0426 , with @xmath8 , demonstrating the broad color range of the lmcgs .    for discussion purposes ,",
    "we arbitrarily define blue lmcgs as galaxies which are @xmath9 away , or bluer , than the color - magnitude relationship as defined by the giant elliptical galaxy color scatter at m@xmath10 ( e.g , .",
    "conselice et al .",
    "lmcgs which are @xmath11 redder than the cmr are denoted as red systems .",
    "this 2@xmath12 separation is shown as the dashed line in figure  1 .",
    "conselice et al .",
    "( 2002b ) show that the red lmcgs can not be accounted for as old low - mass systems within standard star - formation scenarios ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ; nagamine et al .",
    "2001a ) due to their high inferred metallicities , but the blue low - mass cluster galaxies have properties that fit these early formation models .",
    "the blue lmcg color distribution can also be fit by a gaussian , while the red and total lmcg color distributions are not well fit by gaussians , as they both have a broad distribution in color .",
    "conselice et al .",
    "( 2002b ) suggest that the red lmcgs galaxies are cluster members that did not originated within the cluster , but are the remnants of stripped down larger galaxies that were accreted into the cluster in the last few gyrs . as such",
    ", these red lmcgs could be acting as masquerading dwarf spheroidals that were not part of the initial mass function of the cluster as predicted in numerical and semi - analytic simulations ( e.g. , springel et al .",
    "2001 ; nagamine et al .",
    "how do these red lmcgs affect the computed abell  0426 luminosity function ?",
    "the total abell  0426 cluster luminosity function is shown in figure  2 as solid circles and as a solid fitted line .",
    "the luminosity function of the red and blue lmcgs are plotted as open and solid triangles and as long - dashed and dotted lines in figure  2 .",
    "these luminosity functions are complete down to our limit of @xmath13 as discussed in conselice et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "the faint - end of these luminosity functions are fit by the schechter function and a power - law .",
    "the schechter function fit gives the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath0 ; which are the normalization , characteristic luminosity , and faint - end slope . while the power law form is given by @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting faint - end computations of @xmath0 are found to be consistent between these two fitting methods .",
    "for the entire abell  0426 galaxy population , we find @xmath0 = -1.44@xmath10.04 ( solid line ) .",
    "when we consider just the blue population , @xmath0 = -1.25@xmath10.05 ( dotted line ) , which is different from the total abell  0426 cluster luminosity function at a significance of @xmath16 . for the red lmcgs",
    "a power - law fit gives @xmath0 = -1.82@xmath10.05 ( long dashed line ) , which is @xmath17 different from the blue luminosity function . for comparison purposes we calculate the luminosity function ( short dashed line ) of the objects we identify as background systems ( crosses ) , finding @xmath0 = -1.81@xmath10.03 .",
    "this suggests that there is a strong color dependence on the luminosity function of abell  0426 such that the lf becomes steeper at the faint end due to the presence of red lmcgs .",
    "we are not the first to identify steepening lfs due to different types of low - mass galaxies in clusters , however .",
    "boyce et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue from observations of a @xmath18 cluster that its luminosity function is steepened by a population of blue starbursting dwarfs .",
    "the @xmath0 = -1.25 slope has been considered the ` universal ' luminosity function faint end slope since schechter ( 1976 ) and is the slope of the field luminosity function computed using sloan digitized sky survey ( sdss ) data ( blanton et al .",
    "2001 ; cf .",
    "cross et al .",
    "2001 for the 2df lf giving @xmath0 @xmath5 -1.1 ) .",
    "clusters have fitted @xmath0 values that range from -0.9 to -2.2 depending upon the cluster , area sampled , and method of computation ( e.g. , trentham 1998 ) .",
    "however , semi - analytic and numerical models predict lfs that are generally flatter than @xmath19 ( kauffmann , nusser & steinmetz 1997 ; springel et al . 2001 ; nagamine et al . 2001b ; benson et al . 2001 ; although cf .",
    "kauffmann et al .",
    "1997 , @xmath0 = -2 for dark matter halos ) . as the lf slope for the blue lmcgs in abell  0426",
    "are near the field values and close to what models predict , the intriguing possibility exists that there is a universal initial galaxy mass function that is altered by cluster dynamical effects that create these red lmcgs .",
    "is there an universal initial mass function for galaxies that is independent of environment ? could the large differences in luminosity functions observed in clusters and in the field ( e.g. , binggeli et al .",
    "1988 ) be the result of evolution induced by dynamical effects acting on a universal luminosity function ? to explore the idea that cluster processes could change the luminosity functions of clusters , we simulate the evolution of a cluster s lf as it undergoes a simple analytic dynamical stripping processes .",
    "this is done by using the field luminosity function of @xmath20 galaxies from the sdss ( blanton et al .",
    "we convert the sdss g@xmath21 band lf into a b - band lf by using the conversion factor given in fukugita et al .",
    "the resulting schechter function is given by the parameters , @xmath22 = 0.007  mpc@xmath23 , m@xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that the sdss field lf is indicative of the passive evolution of the galaxy mass function at @xmath26 .",
    "this assumption has some basis in actuality as interactions between field galaxies are not common , as they are by definition in low - density environments . to simulate the formation of a cluster lf",
    ", we assume that the initial abell  0426 lf resembled the blanton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) field lf at z = 0 , except that @xmath22 is normalized to match the abell  0426 galaxy density .",
    "we then simulate the effects of tidal interactions on these galaxies and compute the resulting lf . after performing this simulation ,",
    "we find that the faint - end slope , @xmath0 , becomes steeper .",
    "we demonstrate this through limited monte carlo simulations of mass - loss induced through high - speed impulse galaxy interactions .",
    "the model we use follows the general analytic procedure described in aguilar and white ( 1985 ) and conselice et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "these analytic computations are for simple spherical galaxies , which is an over simplification to most cluster galaxies .",
    "the dynamical stripping process is furthermore generally more complicated than the simple model we use , as the physics involves several components we are not considering , including : the distribution of mass in individual galaxies , the clumpiness of the cluster mass distributions ( gnedin 1999 ) , and the closest approach towards the center of the cluster ( merritt 1994 ) . with these caveats in mind , we model the mass evolution of galaxies in the central 300 kpc area of a rich cluster with properties similar to abell  0426 . given these parameters , most galaxies should pass well within the center of the cluster and tidal effects should be quite pronounced ( e.g. , merritt 1984 ; gnedin 1999 ) . using these assumptions the total initial mass m@xmath2 is related to the final total mass , m@xmath27 , after a single interaction by : m@xmath28 m@xmath2@xmath29 with a total mass loss rate @xmath30m / m @xmath31 ( conselice et al . 2002b ) per interaction .",
    "we simulate the stripping process by computing the evolutionary history of each galaxy from the sdss field lf after it goes through the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the parameters varied are the stellar mass - loss rate , @xmath32 , and the number of interactions which is chosen from a distribution function having a maximum number of possible interactions , q. the distribution of the number of interactions galaxies can undergo in the simulation is divided into two equal components .",
    "one half of the galaxies undergo a low number of interactions equally distributed from 1 to 10 .",
    "the other half of the galaxies all undergo q interactions , which is changed for each simulation . to determine the stellar mass loss rate we take into account the effects of different dark matter distributions in galaxies by including a factor that corresponds to the fact that low - mass galaxies are dark matter dominated ( peterson & caldwell 1993 ) . because low - mass systems have higher m@xmath33/l ratios , and possibly extended dark halos , it is therefore harder to remove stellar mass located at their centers . to account for this",
    "we assume that the stellar mass loss rate , @xmath32 , is inversely proportional to the m@xmath33/l ratio , @xmath34(m@xmath33/l)@xmath3 @xmath35(l@xmath36 ) ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1985 ) , which we arbitrarily normalize at m@xmath37 .",
    "note that the aguilar & white ( 1985 ) mass loss rates we use are independent of the total mass or m@xmath33/l ratio of a galaxy , but as we explicitly assume that lower mass cluster galaxies contain extended dark matter halos , the stellar mass loss rate , @xmath32 , is a function of mass and m@xmath33/l .",
    "otherwise , if we do not include this dependence on the m@xmath33/l ratio , low - mass systems are evaporated quickly in the simulation and the lf never becomes much steeper than the universal value .    through numerical and analytical models ,",
    "a reasonable maximum mass loss rate per interaction is @xmath38 for a relatively strong interaction using the conditions in abell  0426 ( e.g. , aguilar & white 1985 ; conselice et al .",
    "our simulations therefore select a random @xmath39 value from 0 to 0.1 for each interaction .",
    "the number of interactions the galaxies in the simulations undergo is given by the distribution function described above . after a simulation",
    "is run , the result is a new galaxy luminosity distribution from which a luminosity function is computed and then fit after normalizing the number of galaxies produced down to m@xmath40 equal to the number observed in the center of abell  0426 as discussed in conselice et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "how does the faint end of the lf change as a function of the maximum number of interactions , q ? this",
    "is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the faint - end slope @xmath0 decreases until the number of interactions reaches @xmath5400 where @xmath41 .",
    "the efficiency of the mass - loss processes becomes high enough such that at q@xmath42 a significant number of galaxies become fainter than the magnitude limit m@xmath40 .",
    "this is a reasonable number of interactions in a rich cluster as high - speed encounters are effective out to many times the scale lengths of typical galaxies ( e.g. , aguilar & white 1985 ) , and there are @xmath43 galaxies in the inner 300 kpc of abell  0426 , which a cluster galaxy will transverse every 0.3 gyrs .",
    "this simple model demonstrates that by considering the evolution of initial luminosity functions through mass - loss induced by high speed encounters between galaxies the luminosity function becomes steeper .",
    "these models also suggest that the observed lf down to m@xmath40 becomes flatter in denser and older areas where more interactions have occurred .",
    "this is consistent with finding flatter lfs in the central parts of clusters , as these are the densest and oldest locations and thus areas where stripping processes can create a deficiency of low - mass systems ( see also oemler 1974 ; lopez - cruz et al .",
    "1997 ; adami et al .",
    "we briefly re - address in this section the issue of red faint cluster galaxies recently found in a host of nearby clusters ( e.g. , adami et al . 2000 ; rakos et al .",
    "2001 ; mobasher et al . 2001 ; conselice et al . 2002a , b ) to show that these galaxies could be the remnants of tidally stripped higher mass systems .",
    "it is clear that some tidal stripping has occurred in the past due to the presence of a significant amount of intracluster light and tidal debris tails ( gregg & west 1998 ) as well as from examples of cluster galaxies that appear to be in the process of undergoing disruption , but with no obvious nearby neighbors ( conselice & gallagher 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "we examine the resulting metallicity , and inferred color , distributions of galaxies after they undergo the stripping process through the use of @xmath44cdm modeled galaxies produced by nagamine et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "nagamine et al .",
    "( 2001a ) produce through hydrodynamic simulations galaxies with various metallicities , luminosities and star - formation histories .",
    "we use these galaxies as the initial cluster sample .",
    "each of these galaxies is sent through the monte carlo simulation , described in  3 , to determine the amount of mass - loss occurring after q=300 interactions when @xmath45 ( figure  3 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the resulting magnitude - metallicity - color diagram where the small crosses are the original @xmath44cdm galaxies and the dots show where this same population falls on this diagram after they go through the simulation described in  3 .",
    "we implement a color evolution in these systems by assuming these galaxies follow the average ( b - r ) color gradients seen in spiral bulges ( balcells & peletier 1994 ) and by using the trend between the radii and magnitudes of galaxies as described in binggeli & cameron ( 1991 ) .",
    "after mass stripping occurs in a galaxy it will become fainter , and smaller , due to the strong correlation between galaxy size and magnitude ( binggeli & cameron 1991 ) .",
    "since the inner parts of galaxies are redder , and metal rich ( e.g. , balcells & peletier 1994 ) , the stripping process produces fainter , more metal - rich , and hence redder , galaxies .",
    "the metallicity [ fe / h ] of the nagamine et al .",
    "simulated galaxies are converted into a ( b - r ) color using an empirical relationship between these two parameters found by harris ( 1996 ) for old globular clusters .",
    "lmcgs and giant ellipticals in abell  0426 , as discussed in conselice et al .",
    "( 2002a , b ) , are plotted on figure  1 .",
    "the new magnitude - metallicity diagram ( dots ) changes from the initial one ( crosses ) due to the effects of mass - loss , and as a result a population of red low - mass cluster galaxies is created .",
    "the more luminous , and thus more massive , systems lose more stellar mass than the fainter systems and hence their remnants are faint and red .",
    "the lower mass systems , because of their higher m@xmath33/l ratios , lose a lower fraction of their stellar light and thus become slightly fainter and more metal - rich , but not as much as the higher luminosity systems do .",
    "the result of this is the creation of a remnant population with different colors but with similar luminosities , within the range m@xmath46 = -10.5 to -12.5 .",
    "this simple example shows that the high - speed interaction process could be responsible for producing the observed number of red low - luminosity cluster galaxies that are ` artificially ' steepening the luminosity functions of clusters .",
    "this also implies that tidal stripping of material from these galaxies is at least partially the cause of intracluster light and cd halos ( gallagher & ostriker 1972 ) .",
    "the simulations and results presented in this letter are more general than that implied by the assumptions of the underlying physical effects discussed .",
    "two things are firmly suggested by our results .",
    "the first is that no matter what the origin of the objects identified as red lmcgs are , they are steepening the lf , and future lf determinations should account for this effect .",
    "the second is that any cluster stripping process that removes mass , including several alternative scenarios we have not considered , will naturally produced galaxies with low - masses and red colors .",
