    "compton scattering in quasi - spherical accretion flows is thought to be responsible for the x - ray spectra of many accreting compact objects .",
    "for example , the hard x - ray spectra of weakly - magnetic accreting neutron stars can be accounted for if a geometrically thick , hot medium surrounds the neutron star and inner accretion disk ( see , e.g. , psaltis , lamb , & miller 1995 ) .",
    "the spectral signature of isolated neutron stars accreting from the interstellar medium , which is required for their positive identification , is determined mainly by the efficiency of compton upscattering of thermal photons emitted from the stellar surfaces ( see , e.g. , zampieri et al .",
    "moreover , compton scattering plays a major role in the formation of the high - energy spectra of advection - dominated accretion flows , which may be the relevant mode of accretion onto galactic and supermassive black holes ( see , e.g. , esin et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "compton scattering in static and moving media , even in plane - parallel or spherical symmetry , couples strongly all three independent phase - space coordinates of the photons , namely their energy , direction of propagation , and spatial coordinate .",
    "for this reason , monte carlo methods have been used extensively in calculating comptonization spectra , because of their easy implementation and natural treatment of the diverse length scales in an accretion flow ( see , e.g. , laurent & titarchuk 1999 for a recent study ; methods and results based on monte carlo treatments have been reviewed by pozdnyakov , sobol , & sunyaev 1983 and will not be discussed here ) .",
    "alternatively , compton scattering can be studied by solving the energy - dependent radiative transfer equation or its moments .",
    "implementing such a method is more difficult and often relies on a number of approximations for describing the interaction of radiation with matter ( see , however , poutanen & svensson 1996 and hsu & blaes 1998 for complete solutions in static media ) .",
    "however , at the same time it is substantially faster and offers significant advantages when the radiative transfer problem is coupled to a solution of the fluid dynamics , as well as in treating steep spectra and processes that do not conserve photons .    over the last twenty five years",
    "several authors have derived the photon kinetic or radiative transfer equation and their moments for compton scattering in static and moving media ( see , e.g. , kompaneets 1957 ; babuel - peyrissac & rouvillois 1969 ; pomraning 1973 ; chan & jones 1975 ; payne 1980 ; blandford & payne 1981a ; thorne 1981 ; fukue , kato , & matsumoto 1985 ; madej 1989 , 1991 ; titarchuk 1994 ) .",
    "the moment equations derived by these various sets of authors have been widely used in studies of comptonization by static media ( see , e.g. , katz 1976 ; shapiro , lightman , & eardly 1976 ; sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) or by strong shocks and accretion flows onto compact objects ( see , e.g. , blandford & payne 1981b ; payne & blandford 1981 ; lyubarskij & sunyaev 1982 ; colpi 1988 ; riffert 1988 ; mastichiadis & kylafis 1992 ; titarchuk & lyubarskij 1995 ; turolla et al . 1996 ; titarchuk , mastichiadis , & kylafis 1997 ) , either under the diffusion approximation or with closure relations that were specified a priori .",
    "most of the above analyses of compton scattering in moving media were performed in the system frame and to first order in the electron bulk velocity . on the other hand , schmid - burgk ( 1978 ) , zane et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and titarchuk & zannias ( 1998 ) have solved the general - relativistic radiative transfer equation for compton scattering without the need for specifying a priori closure relations .    in paper i ( psaltis & lamb 1997 ) of this series , the time - dependent photon kinetic and radiative transfer equations were derived , as well as their zeroth and first moments that describe absorption , emission , and spontaneous and induced compton scattering in static and moving media , correcting various errors in the literature .",
    "the system - frame equations that were derived are valid to first order in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and to _ second _ order in @xmath1 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the electron mass and temperature , @xmath6 is the photon energy , and @xmath1 is the bulk velocity of the electrons in units of the speed of light ; the fluid - frame equations that were derived are valid for arbitrary values of the bulk velocity @xmath1 . using these equations",
    "it was argued in paper i that the effects of comptonization by the bulk electron velocity that are described by the terms that are second - order in @xmath1 are qualitatively different than and can become at least as important as the effects described by the terms that are first - order in @xmath1 , even when @xmath1 is small . as a result , these second - order terms should generally be retained ( see also yin & miller 1995 ) .    in this paper ,",
    "i describe a numerical algorithm for the solution of time - independent radiative transfer problems in systems with spherical symmetry . even though the natural reference frame for solving transport problems is the one comoving with the flow , i work in the system frame , which can be any inertial frame in which the central object is at rest .",
    "this is important for the fast algorithm described below , because the moment equations in the system frame are always parabolic ( as shown in  3 ) in contrast to the fluid - frame equations ( turolla , zampieri , & nobili 1995 ; smit , cernohorsky , & dullemond 1997 ; see also krner & janka 1992 ) .",
    "moreover , in problems of mass accretion onto a compact star , the boundary conditions are often more easily implemented in the system frame .",
    "i also neglect any general relativistic effects , which can be shown to introduce only small quantitative corrections to the emerging spectra ( papathanassiou & psaltis 2000 ) , and truncate the transfer equation keeping only terms up to second order in @xmath1 .",
    "the algorithm used is a generalization of the method of variable eddington factors ( mihalas 1980 ; see also mihalas 1978 , p.  157158 ) .",
    "it is therefore accurate for systems of arbitrary optical depth and does not require a priori specification of closure relations .",
    "it is based on the iterative solution of both the transfer equation and the systems of its first two moments and hence the validity and accuracy of the solution can be verified explicitly at the end of each run .",
    "the method also requires only a small number of iterations in order to converge to the solution and is therefore ideal for future extensions to time - dependent and multi - dimensional transport problems .    in  2",
    ", i summarize the results from paper i and introduce the notation . in ",

    "when the electron density is uniform , then the dimensionless quantity @xmath43 is equal to the electron scattering optical depth in the radial direction measured from @xmath27 .",
    "the coefficients in equations ( [ 0th3 ] ) and ( [ 1st ] ) are given in appendix  c.    _ boundary conditions_the boundary conditions for both the transfer equation and the system of its moments depend on the specific problem under study .",
    "for the model problems discussed in  5 , i shall assume that the flow is not illuminated from the outside , i.e. , @xmath44 at the outer boundary , and specify the radiation flux at the inner boundary as @xmath45    for solving the moments of the radiative transfer equation i shall specify , for all photon energies @xmath6 , the first moment of the monochromatic specific intensity at the inner radius , i.e. , @xmath46 as well as the ratio of the first to the zeroth moment of the monochromatic specific intensity at the outer radius @xmath47 the quantity @xmath48 is not known a priori but is calculated in a self - consistent way in the iterative method described below .",
    "i shall also set at all radii @xmath49 and @xmath50 which reflect the fact that the photon occupation number and the radiation flux are finite quantities .",
    "in the method of variable eddington factors , the system of partial differential equations ( [ 0th3 ] ) and ( [ 1st ] ) is solved iteratively with the radiative transfer equation  ( [ rteq ] ) , given a set of eddington factors computed from the previous iteration .",
    "the boundary conditions and the method used for the solution of the system depends on the character of the partial differential operator . for example , the system of moment equations in the frame _ comoving _ with the flow ( or the local lorentz frame when gravitational effects are taken into account ) may be hyperbolic or elliptic , depending on the velocity field ( turolla et al .",

    "i follow the procedure outlined by ames ( 1992 , pp .",
    "812 ) to show that the _ system - frame _ , energy dependent moment equations always form a parabolic system of partial differential equations , thus simplifying the implementation of the numerical algorithm .",
    "i define the quantities @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which together with the partial differential equations ( [ 0th3 ] ) and ( [ 1st ] ) , and the equations for the differentials @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , form an @xmath57 system of algebraic equations for the eight derivatives @xmath58 \\cdot \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\partial_\\e j\\\\ \\partial_{\\tau_r } j\\\\ \\partial_\\e h^r\\\\ \\partial_{\\tau_r } h^r\\\\ \\partial_\\e l\\\\ \\partial_{\\tau_r } l\\\\ \\partial_\\e m^r\\\\ \\partial_{\\tau_r } m^r\\\\ \\end{array } \\right ] & = & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath59\\;.\\ ] ] equating the determinant of the coefficient matrix to zero , i obtain the characteristic equation for the system of equations , @xmath60 the coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath62 are proportional to the electron temperature and the square of the bulk velocity ( see appendix  c ) and hence for the problems under consideration they are never zero .",
    "therefore , for a finite electron energy @xmath6 , the system of partial differential equations ( [ 0th3 ] ) and ( [ 1st ] ) has only one multiple , real characteristic direction , i.e. , @xmath63 , and hence is always parabolic .",
    "the difference with respect to the moment equations in the comoving frame arises from the presence of second order energy derivatives in the differential operator .",
    "equation ( [ rteq ] ) is an integro - differential equation for the specific intensity of the radiation field and therefore any numerical solution of this equation is not trivial to obtain . on the other hand ,",
    "the system of equations ( [ 0th3 ] ) and ( [ 1st ] ) depends on two variable eddington factors and an unknown outer boundary condition , which can be computed only when the solution of equation ( [ rteq ] ) for the specific intensity is obtained . here",
    ", i employ a numerical algorithm that is a generalization of the method of variable eddington factors ( mihalas 1980 ; see also mihalas 1978 , pp .",
    "157158 ) in order to solve iteratively equation ( [ rteq ] ) for the specific intensity of the radiation field and the system of partial differential equations ( [ 0th3 ] ) and ( [ 1st ] ) for its zeroth and first moments .",
    "this algorithm has been proven to be very efficient and gives a solution to the complete transfer equation that is limited only by numerical accuracy , independent of the optical depth of the medium .    in this method ,",
    "i first solve the moments of the transfer equation using an initial guess for the variable eddington factors and for the outer boundary condition .",
    "i then compute the generalized source function using the calculated moments of the specific intensity , solve the radiative transfer equation , and use this solution to update the eddington factors .",
    "i repeat the whole procedure until convergence is achieved .",
    "the moments of the transfer equation depend only on radius and photon energy , when the variable eddington factors are known .",
    "therefore , i discretize the domain of solution and the differential operators of equations ( [ 0th3 ] ) and ( [ 1st ] ) on a two  dimensional mesh of @xmath64 grid points over the variable @xmath43 and @xmath65 grid points over the photon energy @xmath6",
    ".    the mesh of discrete grid points over the variable @xmath43 must resolve the rapid change of the variable eddington factors with optical depth near both boundaries of the domain of solution . in order to achieve this ,",
    "i define the mesh points to be equidistant in the quantity @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the total optical depth ( and not the quantity @xmath43 ) in the radial direction measured from @xmath27 , @xmath68 is the maximum radial optical depth in the medium , and @xmath69 is a parameter that allows a combination of a logarithmic grid near the boundaries with a linear grid in the interior . because the spectra that emerge from comptonizing media are usually power laws , i use a logarithmic mesh of discrete grid points over photon energy @xmath6 .",
    "the system of moment equations involve differentiation over two density - like quantities , the radiation energy density @xmath70 and the first eddington factor @xmath71 , and two flux - like quantities , the radiation energy flux @xmath72 and the second eddington factor @xmath73 .",
    "i discretize density - like quantities in a shell - centered fashion and flux - like quantities on the grid points .",
    "let @xmath74 be the value of a physical quantity at the @xmath75th grid point in the variable @xmath43 and the @xmath76th grid point in photon energy .",
    "away from the boundaries , i differentiate density - like quantities over the variable @xmath43 on the grid points as @xmath77 and flux - like quantities as @xmath78 in an explicit or fully implicit scheme .    in both equations",
    "i approximate the first derivative of a physical quantity @xmath79 with respect to photon energy by @xmath80 and the second derivative with respect to photon energy by @xmath81 where the index ` @xmath75 ' in the quantity @xmath74 may also be fractional , corresponding to a shell center , as needed by an implicit differencing scheme over the variable @xmath43 .",
    "the energy differencing scheme  ( [ 1stder])([2ndder ] ) can not be used directly in differencing the radiation energy density and flux in equations  ( [ 0th3 ] ) and ( [ 1st ] ) because it does not guarantee particle conservation when only scattering is taken into account ( chang & cooper 1970 ) .",

    "the photon number flux is simply equal to @xmath84 and integrating equation  ( [ cons ] ) over photon energy gives @xmath85 i.e. , photon conservation .",

    "is related to the requirement that the photon energy density is everywhere positive .",
    "this introduces a restriction on the spacing of the energy grid , depending on the differencing scheme . for the scheme used above",
    "it can be shown that the requirement for a positive photon energy density results in the restriction ( cf .",

    ", the system of difference equations can be solved to a fractional accuracy of @xmath99 within less than fifty iterations , which can be performed in a few seconds on a current workstation .      in the iterative method of the variable eddington factors ,",
    "the transfer equations  ( [ rteq ] ) is solved at every grid point in the @xmath100 plane for the boundary conditions  ( [ inbound ] ) and ( [ outbound ] ) .",
    "because the generalized source function is calculated using the results from the previous iterations , the solution of equation ( [ rteq ] ) is just the formal solution that can be obtained analytically , i.e. , @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 or @xmath104 when @xmath105 or @xmath106 respectively . in calculating the integrals in equation  ( [ formal ] ) , i use a piece - wise linear interpolation of the source function through each shell and evaluate the energy derivatives according to equations  ( [ 1stder])([2ndder ] ) .",
    "the rapid convergence of the method of variable eddington factors is preserved in the current implementation for the problem of compton scattering .",
    "this is shown in figure  2 , where the maximum fractional error in the radiation energy density is plotted for each iteration , for two uniform media with different scattering optical depths .",
    "for the model problems shown , the outer radius of the scattering medium is set to @xmath107 , its electron temperature to 10  kev , and the energy - dependence of the radiation flux at the inner boundary to be that of a blackbody with a temperature of 0.5  kev .",
    "the converge is typically faster for problems with higher optical depths , because i have used @xmath108 as an initial value for the first variable eddington factor , which is closer to the real value at the limit of high optical depth .",

    "all these authors showed that the emerging radiation spectrum at energies much larger than the energy of the injected photons is largely independent of the details of the input spectrum and can be described by a power - law with an exponential cut - off at @xmath112 . here",

    "the energy dependence of the radiation energy density changes within one photon mean - free - path from the inner boundary but remains unchanged at larger radii . on the other hand",
    ", the radiation flux evolves throughout the scattering medium .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the system of moment equations has been solved by imposing an inner boundary condition on @xmath113 and an outer boundary condition on the ratio @xmath114 and not on @xmath70 itself .",
    "figure  4 shows the first eddington factor @xmath115 at two photon energies as well as the ratio of the energy - integrated second to zeroth moments of the specific intensity of the radiation field .",
    "the eddington factor depends on photon energy even though the scattering cross section and hence the photon mean - free - path are mostly energy independent at these low photon energies .",
    "this is because photons were injected into the medium with energies @xmath116 and on average gain energy at each scattering . as a result ,",
    "photons emerging with low energy have experienced on average a smaller number of scatterings than photons with higher energy and therefore their distribution is less isotropic .",
    "figure  5 compares the emerging radiation spectrum obtained using the method of variable eddington factors with the spectra obtained using the same boundary conditions but two energy - independent prescriptions of the first eddington factor that are commonly used ; the second eddington factor does not enter the calculation when the bulk velocity of the electrons is zero .",
    "note that neither prescription is the correct diffusion approximation for compton scattering because they both neglect the energy dependence of @xmath71 on photon energy shown in figure  4 .",
    "however , the discrepancy between the self - consistent solution and the ones obtained using prescribed eddington factors is small for the prescription that depends on optical depth and can be as large as @xmath117% at high photon energies for the prescription that is independent of optical depth .",

    "figure  6 shows the radiation spectrum at the inner boundary , the emerging radiation spectrum when only terms that are first - order in the electron bulk velocity are taken into account , as well as the emerging radiation spectrum that is correct to second order in the electron bulk velocity , for a flow with a scattering optical depth of 2 .",
    "the terms that are first - order in the electron bulk velocity describe mainly the effects of non - relativistic doppler shift and hence produce a displacement in @xmath121 of the input spectrum towards higher photon energies ( see also psaltis & lamb 2000 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the terms that are second - order in the electron bulk velocity result in a systematic photon upscattering and produce a power - law tail at photon energies higher than the average energy of the injected photons . note here that the approximation employed here of keeping , in the scattering kernel , only terms that are first order in @xmath6 limits the validity of the calculation to energies @xmath122  kev .    when the total optical depth of the scattering medium , and hence the average number of scatterings that each photon experiences , are increased , then on average photons gain more energy by scattering off moving electrons .",
    "as a result , the emerging radiation spectrum is displaced towards higher photon energies , and the power - law tail becomes flatter ( see fig .",
    "when the bulk electron velocity in the flow increases , the average energy gain per scattering increases as well , and hence the power - law tail also becomes flatter ( fig .",
    "7b ) . as a result",
    ", scattering of photons by fast moving electrons produces power - law tails at high photon energies , even in divergence - free flows , in a way that is similar to the well understood process of thermal comptonization .",
    "i finally perform simple model calculations of accretion onto and outflows from a central object by assuming a free - fall density profile and setting everywhere in the flow the electron temperature to zero and the inward radial velocity equal to the free - fall velocity from infinity onto a compact object with a radius of 10  km and a gravitational mass of @xmath123 .",
    "i also set the outer radius of the medium to @xmath119 ; at these large radii the photon mean - free path is large compared to radius and the electron bulk velocity is small compared to the speed of light that the flow does not effect significantly the photon distribution .",
    "finally , instead of specifying the mass accretion rate onto the compact object , i specify the total electron - scattering optical depth of the flow .",
    "figure  8a shows the radiation spectrum at the inner boundary , the emerging radiation spectrum when only terms that are first - order in the electron bulk velocity are taken into account , as well as the emerging radiation spectrum that is correct to second order in the electron bulk velocity . as in the model calculation discussed in  5.2 ,",
    "the terms that are first - order in the electron bulk velocity describe mostly the non - relativistic doppler shifts and produce a displacement in @xmath121 of the input radiation spectrum towards higher photon energies . on the other hand , the terms that are second - order in the electron bulk velocity systematically upscatter photons and produce a power - law tail at high photon energies .",
    "when the optical depth of the flow is increased , the systematic upscattering of photons becomes more efficient and the high - energy tail becomes flatter .",
    "figure  9 shows the same information as figure  8 but for the case of an outflow . for this model problems",
    "i have used the same parameters as in the inflow calculation but changed the sign of the velocity at all radii . in an outflow , the terms that are first - order in the electron bulk velocity produce a displacement in @xmath121 of the input radiation spectrum towards _ lower _ photon energies .",
    "on the other hand , the effect of the terms that are second - order in the electron bulk velocity is the same as in the case of inflow , i.e. , they systematically upscatter the photons and produce a tail at high photon energies . for the optical depths and bulk velocities considered here , the effect of the second - order terms nearly cancels the effect of the first - order terms and the major difference between the input and emerging spectra is the power - law tail at high photon energies . as in the case of the inflow , when the optical depth of the flow increases , the power - law tail becomes flatter , but the overall effects is significantly reduced .",
    "in the previous sections i described a method for solving numerically the radiative transfer equation that describes compton scattering in spherically symmetric , static and moving media , and applied it to a variety of cases related to flows around compact objects .",
    "i showed that the first eddington factor , which describes the degree of isotropy of the radiation field at a given point in space , may depend on photon energy , even though the photon mean - free - path is energy independent , if the photons are preferably upscattered or downscattered in energy at each scattering .",
    "i also demonstrated that the terms that are first - order in the electron bulk velocity alter the input spectrum in a way that is qualitatively and quantitatively different than the effect of the terms that are of second - order .",
    "the systematic upscattering of photons caused by bulk comptonization is described by the terms that are second - order in @xmath1 .",
    "this becomes apparent by the fact that , at each scattering with a moving electron , the average fractional energy change of a photon in the system frame is always positive , independent of the photon energy , and equal to @xmath124 ( see , e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 , ch .",
    "7 ; see also the discussion in psaltis & lamb 1997 ) .",
    "if the distribution of photon residence times in the comptonizing medium drops exponentially to zero at late times , then a power - law tail is produced at high photon energies ( for total scattering optical depths @xmath125 ) , in analogy to the generation of power - law tails by thermal comptonization .",
    "the velocity at which the terms that are second - order in @xmath1 become important depends on the ratio of the photon mean - free - path @xmath126 to the shortest characteristic length scale @xmath127 in the problem . in general , when @xmath128 , i.e. , in regions close to and within the photon - trapping radius , the terms that are first- and second - order in @xmath1 become comparable in size ( yin & miller 1995 ; psaltis & lamb 1997a ) and hence the latter should not be neglected .",
    "the generalization of the method to time - independent multi - dimensional configurations is conceptually easy .",
    "however , a problem with axial symmetry requires the solution of the radiative transfer equation in five dimensions in phase space and the introduction of a large number of independent variable eddington factors .",
    "moreover , the presence of high flow velocities in multi - dimensions introduces sharp gradients in the variable eddington factors , which can not be guessed a priori , as required for the first iteration ( dykema , klein , & castor 1996 ) . even with these problems ,",
    "however , the method of variable eddington factors will still offer a significant advantage , when compared to any other iterative method , which arises from the fact that the eddington factors are bound to lie over a very narrow range of values .",
    "the fast convergence of the numerical algorithm presented here makes it also ideal for future extensions to transport problems coupled to time - dependent hydrodynamics . for the case of accretion onto and",
    "outflows from compact objects , the characteristic photon diffusion timescale from a flow of dimension @xmath129 is of order @xmath130 which is significantly smaller than the corresponding @xmath131  ms dynamical timescale . as a result , for",
    "most cases the structure of the radiation field can be obtained by solving the time - independent radiative transfer problem for each snapshot of the fluid properties .",
    "given that the variable eddington factors will be only marginally different between successive timesteps , the convergence of the algorithm will be even faster than what is shown in figure  2 .",
