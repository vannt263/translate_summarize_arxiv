    "a classical nova ( cn ) outburst occurs in an interacting binary system comprising a white dwarf ( wd ; the primary ) and typically a late - type main - sequence star ( the secondary ) that fills its roche lobe @xcite .",
    "matter is transferred , usually via an accretion disk around the wd , from the secondary to the wd surface , becoming degenerate in the process .",
    "once extensive cno cycle nuclear burning commences under these degenerate conditions , a thermonuclear runaway occurs ejecting @xmath0 of matter from the system with velocities from hundreds to thousands of km  s@xmath1  ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these systems generally have orbital periods of a few hours @xcite and recurrence times of a few @xmath2 years are often quoted @xcite .",
    "cne are traditionally sub - divided using solely their eruptive properties , typically speed class @xcite , or spectral class @xcite .",
    "more recently , novae have also been classified as `` disk '' or `` bulge '' novae , on the basis of their parent stellar population and location within the host galaxy .",
    "closely related to these systems are the recurrent novae ( rne ) , which , unlike cne , are observed to recur on time - scales of order tens to a hundred years .",
    "however , it should be noted that the upper limit to this range is likely to be an observational effect based on the paucity of historical records .",
    "such a short recurrence time - scale is usually attributed to a high mass wd , probably close to the chandrasekhar limit , together with a high accretion rate @xcite .",
    "the orbital periods of rne are less homogeneous than those of cne , with periods ranging from a few hours to several hundreds of days @xcite .",
    "recurrent nova systems have been sub - divided into three general sub - classes @xcite via a combination of the properties of the eruption and via the properties of the progenitor system whilst at quiescence :    _ rs  oph / t  crb systems _",
    "( hereafter the rs  oph - class ) are observed to contain red giant secondaries and hence have much longer orbital periods ( @xmath3 a year ) , and typically smaller outburst amplitudes than cne .",
    "their outbursts exhibit rapid declines from maximum , with large ejection velocities ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these systems show evidence of an interaction between the ejecta and material from the pre - existing red giant wind .",
    "the ejected mass from these systems is typically two orders of magnitude less than that observed from cn systems ( see papers within * ? ? ?",
    "_ u  sco systems _ are observed to contain evolved main sequence or sub - giant secondaries , with orbital periods closer to those of cne ( hours up to of order a day ) .",
    "they again exhibit rapid declines , being amongst the fastest declining novae observed , with very high ejection velocities ( up to @xmath5 ) .",
    "their post - outburst spectra resemble those of the he / n sub - class of cne @xcite .",
    "these systems eject a similar mass of material as rs oph systems .",
    "the _ t  pyx systems _",
    "( also ci  aql and i m  nor ) are much more akin to cne .",
    "they exhibit short orbital periods and spectroscopically resemble fe  ii cne @xcite .",
    "their optical decline rate classifies them as moderately fast or slow novae .",
    "the ejected mass in these systems is consistent with the range observed in cne ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "these systems are generally only distinguishable from cne due to their shorter recurrence times , not by the properties of the progenitor system or the outburst .",
    "the short inter - outburst time observed in rne is likely due to some combination of a higher mass wd and an accretion rate greater than the typical for cn systems .",
    "indeed , both rs  oph and u  sco ( amongst others from these classes ) appear to have wds close to the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "a number of authors ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have indicated that the wd mass may be increasing over time and these systems have been proposed as a type ia supernova ( sn ) progenitor candidate ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite reported that u  sco could contain an o - ne wd , rather than a c - o wd , and hence may not evolve in to a type ia sn as is widely predicted for this system .",
    "any cn that has been observed to erupt more than once is re - classified as a recurrent nova .",
    "this approach has given us ten galactic rne amongst @xmath7 known galactic cne from an underlying rate of @xmath8  year@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "due to observational effects - which typically worsen the further back in time one looks - it is highly likely that a considerable proportion of these galactic cne are in fact ( short time - scale ) recurrents for which only a single outburst has been observed . either a previous outburst has been missed or the inter - outburst period is particularly long .",
    "so it would be seem advantageous to better develop a nova classification system that relies more on the fundamental properties of the systems than on observational selection effects .    over the past few years observations of a number of galactic `` transients '' have shown properties consistent with being rne , although they had never been seen in outburst previously .",
    "for example , the nova v2487  ophiuchi ( nova oph 1998 ) was observed to have a rapid optical decline and plateau phase @xcite , suggestive of a rn .",
    "consultation of the harvard college observatory archival photographic collection revealed a previously unknown outburst on 1900 june 20 @xcite .",
    "additionally , the novae v1721  aql @xcite , v2491  cyg @xcite , kt  eri @xcite and v2672  oph @xcite and also the extragalactic nova m31n  2007 - 12b @xcite have been shown to harbor secondary stars akin to either the u  sco or rs  oph systems , albeit with only one recorded outburst .    in this paper",
    "we will attempt to simplify the nomenclature somewhat by only classifying each system using the evolutionary state of the secondary ; a main sequence star ( ms - nova ) , a sub - giant star ( sg - nova ) , or a red - giant branch star ( rg - nova ) .",
    "we introduce such classifications in an attempt to avoid the accretion rate / wd mass / recurrence time degeneracy .",
    "all the known u  sco - class rne would be placed into the sg - nova group , all the known rs  oph - class rne into the rg - nova group , the t  pyx - class rne and classical novae will populate the ms - nova group .    by virtue of the geometry of these systems",
    ", the above classifications would effectively be the same as sub - dividing novae by orbital period , if one assumes that the secondaries fill their roche lobes .",
    "the ms - novae would have orbital periods of order hours , the sg - novae of order a day , and the rg - novae of order a year .",
    "indeed @xcite indicates that systems with orbital periods longer than eight hours should contain evolved secondaries .",
    "in this paper we present a simple method which will allow differentiation of rg - novae and sg - novae from the ms - novae population based solely on their quiescent ( inter - outburst ) broad - band optical and near - ir ( nir ) properties .",
    "the format of the remainder of this paper / letter is as follows : in section  [ data ] we briefly describe our method and present the data used to illustrate this technique ; in section  [ results ] we present our results , in section  [ discussion ] we discuss our findings and present a number of predictions and finally , in section  [ conc ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the broad - band optical emission from all quiescent nova systems is a super - position of the emission from the three main components of the system ; the wd , the accretion disk , and the secondary . in all cases we would expect the wd s contribution in the optical to be negligible .",
    "the contribution of the accretion disk to the emission is a combination of a number of factors including ; accretion rate , disk size , system inclination and wavelength .",
    "whereas the contribution from the secondary is much more straightforward and simply depends upon the type ( mass , age and metalicity ) of the star and wavelength .",
    "both the sg - novae and rg - novae have much smaller optical outburst amplitudes than ms - novae , although the energetics of the outbursts of all three systems are comparable . in the rg - nova systems this can be readily explained by the presence of a - highly luminous - red giant secondary , possibly with some additional contribution from a disk , especially in bluer optical filters . for the sg - nova systems the cause is not as clear - cut but",
    "must be some combination of a - luminous - sub - giant secondary and an accretion disk , possibly experience a high mass accretion rate .",
    "the broad - band nir emission from quiescent rg - nova and sg - nova systems should be dominated by the emission from the cool secondary stars , with a small contribution from the accretion disk . at these wavelengths",
    ", the accretion disk emission may still be relatively significant for ms - nova systems due to the low luminosity of the dwarf secondary star .",
    "as such , we propose that the position of a quiescent nova system on a color - magnitude diagram can be broadly predicted .",
    "each system would be expected to lie at such a position that it appears more luminous and bluer ( hotter ) than the secondary in the system , with the magnitude of the luminosity and temperature increase being a function of both the accretion rate , system inclination and - of course - wavelength .",
    "conversely , by plotting quiescent nova systems on a color - magnitude diagram one can identify the type of secondary and hence predict whether a given system may be an rg - nova , sg - nova or ms - nova system .    in table",
    "[ tb : one ] we present quiescent broad - band optical and nir photometric data for a sample of galactic novae ( and a number of extragalactic examples ) .",
    "these data have been collated from a wide range of sources , with all the nir data taken from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) either directly from the catalog or indirectly through additional sources . in table",
    "[ tb : two ] we provide a summary of the best determination of the line of sight extinction and distance to each system as well as the system inclination ( if known ) .",
