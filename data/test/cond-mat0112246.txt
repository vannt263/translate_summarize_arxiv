    "single molecule biomechanical experiments allow to measure the forces generated by biomolecules and their response to applied forces  @xcite . for `` passive '' biopolymers , that do not produce active movement against load , the resulting force - extension curves provide a probe of the nonlinear elasticity of the chains and its relationship to configurational changes .",
    "such studies were carried out for single stranded and double stranded dna  @xcite , for the muscle protein titin  @xcite , the extracellular matrix protein tenascin  @xcite , the polysaccharides dextran  @xcite and xanthan  @xcite , as well as the synthetic polymer poly(ethylene - glycol )  @xcite .",
    "theoretical modeling of the elastic behavior of these polymers is often hampered by lack of detailed knowledge concerning the configurations involved and the relevant interactions .",
    "a direct and detailed confrontation between experiment and theory is however possible for the case of homopolypeptides capable of forming an @xmath4-helix . in this case",
    "the molecular configurations are well understood .",
    "furthermore , one can relate the elastic force law to the known zimm - bragg parameters that characterize the helix - coil transition of the free polypeptides .",
    "as we shall discuss , the extension force law of a long polypeptide just above the melting temperature of the helix , @xmath0 , exhibits two plateaus .",
    "both are associated with a coexistence of helical and coil domains .",
    "the low - tension plateau is due to helix formation induced by the chain extension and the accompanying loss of configurational entropy .",
    "the second , high - tension plateau is due to the extension induced melting of the helices when the end - to - end length exceeds the length of the fully helical chain . for @xmath5",
    "only the second plateau survives but the force law for weak extensions exhibits a `` quasi plateau '' _",
    "i.e. , _ a regime with a weak slope that is not associated with a coexistence .",
    "this last regime is due to the facile alignment of the long persistent regions in the helix . in the following",
    "we analyze the force laws , their dependence on temperature and the corresponding population distribution of helical and coil segments . while we are unaware of single molecule experiments on this system , similar behavior was observed experimentally on fibers of collagen during the 1950s  @xcite .",
    "two different treatments of this problem were recently advanced  @xcite . in the present article we present a unified analysis of the problem , tracing the physical origins of the disagreements between the force laws obtained in the two earlier publications and analyzing their range of validity .",
    "our treatment is distinctive in that it is based on free energy argument instead of the customary transfer matrix approach  @xcite .",
    "this free energy argument allows to recover the results of the transfer matrix method but is physically transparent and relatively simple mathematically . within this approach",
    "we consider the extension of a very long homopolypeptide capable of forming @xmath4-helices .",
    "the discussion is limited to quasi - static extension assuming that the rate of equilibration of the configurations of the chain is much faster than the rate of extension .",
    "two models are explored . in one , the helical domains are viewed as rigid rods while in the second , they are modeled as semiflexible chains . for each model we present a rigorous derivation of the corresponding force law allowing for the polydispersity of the helical and coil domains and the associated mixing entropy ( see fig .",
    "[ multi ] ) .",
    "in addition , we explore two useful approximations allowing for simplified calculations of the force law . in one approximation ,",
    "the mixing entropy of the helices and domains is neglected and the plateau is associated with coexistence of one helical domain with one coil domain ( see fig .  [ phases ] ) . within this `` diblock '' or `` @xmath6 '' approximation",
    "the coexistence regimes involve a first order phase transition . in spite of this erroneous conclusion",
    ", this approximation correctly identifies the important length and force scales in the problem .",
    "the second , mean field approximation , neglects the direct coupling of the distribution of domains sizes and the applied tension . as we shall see , this approximation is actually exact when the helical domains are modeled as long semiflexible chains .",
    "the problem and the analysis are of interest from a number of perspectives .",
    "homopolypeptides are the simplest representatives of helicogenic molecules . in this case",
    "it is not necessary to allow for the sequence heterogeneity which affects the elasticity of heteropolypeptides . nor is it necessary to consider the long range interaction that occur in multiple helices . as a result , the number of parameters invoked in the theory is smaller and the mathematical analysis is simpler .",
    "the force laws obtained are determined by known zimm - bragg parameters with no adjustable parameters . accordingly",
    "this system enables a direct comparison between experiment and theory . in this juncture",
    "it is important to note the availability of synthetic methods for producing long polypeptides with a well defined architecture  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the formalism described provides a convenient basis for the analysis of more complex helicogenic polymers such as dna and collagen . from a polymer science point of view",
    "the elasticity of homopolypeptides is of interest because it reflects the effects of internal degrees of freedom arising from intrachain self - assembly .",
    "the study of these systems enables the exploration of the distinctive non - linear force laws that are the signatures of such intrachain self - assembly .",
    "finally , this elasticity plays a role in the stabilization of the helical state of grafted polypeptides  @xcite . in turn",
    "this is of importance for the function of fusogenic polypeptides and the design of surfaces that favor spreading and growth of cells  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the free energy argument _ via _ an analysis of the helix - coil transition in free , undeformed homopolypeptides .",
    "a semiquantitative analysis of the effect of extension is presented in section iii .",
    "two approaches are used .",
    "one focuses on the intersections of the free energy curves of a pure coil and a pure helix as a function of the end - to - end distance , @xmath2 .",
    "as we shall see , each intersection is a rough diagnostic for a transition between the two configurations and for the occurrence of a plateau in the force law .",
    "the second , more quantitative approach is the diblock or @xmath6 approximation . within this approximation the homopolypeptide",
    "is assumed to consist of two domains , a helix and a coil , and the mixing entropy associated with the polydispersity of the helical and coil domains is set to zero , @xmath6 .",
    "finally , in section iv we present a rigorous analysis of the force laws allowing for the polydispersity of the coexisting helices and coil domains .",
    "as stated earlier , we implement this analysis for two models . in one",
    "the helical domains are viewed as rigid rods and in the second as semiflexible chains described by the worm like chain ( wlc ) model . in this section",
    "we also examine the validity of the mean field approximation introduced in  @xcite . within this approximation ,",
    "the explicit coupling between the tension and the distribution of domain sizes is ignored . as we shall see",
    ", it recovers the exact result when the helices are semiflexible _",
    "i.e. , _ when the persistence length of the helices is finite and the helical domains are large .",
    "the analysis of the rigid helices model recovers the results obtained by tamashiro and pincus  @xcite using a transfer matrix formalism .",
    "a comparison between the two models and an outline of some open problems are presented in the discussion .",
    "it is helpful to first summarize the main features of the helix - coil transition of free polypeptides in the absence of imposed extension .",
    "we will consider only homopolypeptides , consisting of a single type of amino acid residues , in order to avoid complications introduced by sequence of different residues found in heteropolypeptides .",
    "our discussion focuses on the case of long chains where the degree of polymerization of the polymer @xmath7 is large , @xmath8 . to this end",
    "we first discuss the zimm - brag parameters and then introduce the free energy analysis of the transition . as we shall see , this is equivalent to the transfer matrix formalism  @xcite that is traditionally used to analyze the transition  @xcite .",
    "our discussion focuses on helicogenic polypeptides that are capable of assuming two configurations : a random coil and an @xmath4-helix . in the coil state",
    "the monomers are free to rotate thus leading to a small kuhn length with typical value of @xmath9 corresponding to the length of few monomers . for simplicity we will identify the kuhn length with the span of a single monomer , @xmath10 .",
    "the helical configuration involves hydrogen bonds between residues @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this constrains the orientation of the three intermediate monomers . as a result",
    "the persistence length @xmath13 of the helical configuration is large , of order @xmath14 . at the same time",
    "the projected length of a monomer along the axis of the helix decreases to @xmath15 .",
    "the length of the polypeptide in a helical configuration is thus smaller than the span of a fully extended coil by a factor of @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the homopolypeptides are modeled as a two state system .",
    "each monomer can exist either in a helical or a coil state .",
    "choosing the coil state as a reference state , the excess free energy @xmath17 of a monomer within a helical domain reflects two contributions .",
    "first is the change in enthalpy upon formation of an intrachain @xmath18-bond , @xmath19 .",
    "the second is associated with the loss of configurational entropy , @xmath20 , in the helical state .",
    "altogether @xmath21 the enthalpy term favors the helical state while the entropy term favors the coil state .",
    "thus , at low temperatures the free energy @xmath17 is negative and the helical configuration is preferred while at high temperatures @xmath17 is positive and the coil state is dominant .",
    "the two terms are comparable at @xmath22 when @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath0 provides an approximate value for the melting temperature of the @xmath4-helix .",
    "an additional parameter is needed to describe the helix - coil transition .",
    "the number of @xmath18-bonds in a helical domain consisting of @xmath24 monomers is @xmath25 .",
    "it is thus necessary to allow for the special state of the terminal monomers of the helical domain .",
    "these two monomers lose their configurational entropy with no gain due to the formation of @xmath18-bonds .",
    "each of the terminal bonds is thus assigned an excess free energy of @xmath26 with respect to the coil state . in the following",
    "we will use @xmath27 measured with respect to the helical state , that is @xmath28 as we shall discuss later , this definition is consistent with the known experimental results . clearly",
    ", this definition is consistent with the traditional one when the coil state is used as a reference .",
    "@xmath27 plays the role of an interfacial free energy associated with the boundary between helix and coil domains .",
    "this term makes the helix - coil transition cooperative since it favors the formation of large domains .",
    "it is customary to describe the helix - coil transition in terms of the zimm - bragg parameters  @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the @xmath31 dependent @xmath32 represents the boltzmann factor associated with adding one monomer to a helical domain .",
    "@xmath33 at the transition temperature @xmath0 while @xmath34 for @xmath5 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 corresponds to the boltzmann factor associated with the creation of a helical domain .",
    "the definition of @xmath27 as @xmath38 suggests that @xmath37 is independent of @xmath31 .",
    "the definition of @xmath27 as @xmath39 does not predict that @xmath37 is independent of @xmath31 but it yields an identical estimate for the numerical value of @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "the experimentally measured @xmath37 , as obtained from plots of the helical content _ vs. _",
    "@xmath31 , are in the range of @xmath40 , depending on the residue , and exhibit a weak @xmath31 dependence . as stated earlier , in the following we will use @xmath41 . as we shall discuss , a plot of the helical content _ vs. _",
    "@xmath32 exhibits a sigmoid behavior and the width of the transition scales with @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the transition becomes sharper , more cooperative , as @xmath37 decreases .",
    "having defined the relevant molecular parameters , @xmath17 and @xmath43 or equivalently @xmath32 and @xmath44 , we are in a position to analyze the helix - coil transition as it occurs in free chains upon changing the temperature @xmath31 .",
    "the minimal description of the transition requires the specification of two properties , the total number of monomers in a helical configuration , @xmath45 and the number of helical domains , @xmath46 . while @xmath47 and @xmath48 are sufficient for a discussion of the helix - coil transition of free chains , the analysis of the effect of extension requires additional information .",
    "in particular , the probability distribution of helical domains , @xmath49 , and of coil domains , @xmath50 , comprising of @xmath24 monomers . in order to determine these parameters we minimize the appropriate phenomenological free energy .",
    "this method recovers the results obtained by the transfer matrix approach and is easily generalized to allow for the effect of applied tension .",
    "the free energy allows for two principal contributions : ( i ) the free energy of the monomers .",
    "all @xmath51 helical monomers , including the terminal monomers of the domains are assigned an excess free energy of @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath52 terminal monomers are assigned an additional free energy of @xmath53 . as a result",
    "their excess free energy with respect to the coil state is @xmath54 .",
    "( ii ) a mixing entropy term associated with the different possible placements of @xmath51 helical monomers and @xmath52 terminal monomers constituting the domain boundaries .",
    "since the helical and coil domains alternate , there is no entropy due to their mixing .",
    "rather , the mixing entropy arises because of the polydispersity of the domains _ i.e. _ , helical and coil domains of different size @xmath24 are considered distinguishable . since there are @xmath46 helical and @xmath46 coil domains the mixing entropy is @xmath55 the free energy per monomer in the unperturbed chain is thus @xmath56 the lagrange multipliers , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , ensure the normalization @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the two remaining lagrange multipliers , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , impose the average sizes @xmath63 and @xmath64 of the helical and coil domains .",
    "this description corresponds to a simplified version of the transfer matrix method involving a two by two matrix . in both cases",
    "there is no constraint ensuring that helical domains incorporate at least three monomers  @xcite .",
    "since we focus on the case of @xmath65 and @xmath8 the weight of small domains is negligible and this description yields the correct results .",
    "the probabilities @xmath49 and @xmath50 are determined by minimization of @xmath66 with respect to @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( appendix a ) leading to    @xmath67    note that @xmath49 and @xmath50 decay exponentially with decay constants @xmath68 and @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are not sharply peaked at the mean values @xmath63 and @xmath70 .",
    "in particular , there is a significant population of small helices even when the average size of the helical domain @xmath63 is large . in this limit , @xmath71 .",
    "similarly , when @xmath70 is large @xmath72 .    upon substituting @xmath49 and @xmath50 in @xmath73 as given by ( [ eq_free2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath66 as a function of @xmath47 and @xmath48 only  @xcite :    @xmath74    the equilibrium conditions @xmath75 and @xmath76 then lead to    @xmath77    in turn , these yield ( appendix b ) the expression for the equilibrium values of @xmath78 and @xmath48    @xmath79^{-1/2}}{s+1 + \\sqrt{(s-1)^{2}+4\\,\\sigma s}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these expressions are identical to the ones obtained _ via _ the transfer matrix method  @xcite .    the behavior of @xmath47 and @xmath48 as a function of @xmath32 and @xmath37 is plotted in fig .  [ theta0 ] . when @xmath80 we recover the boltzmann distribution for independent two - level systems : @xmath81 .",
    "in marked contrast when @xmath82 , the fraction of helical monomers is steplike : @xmath83 for @xmath34 and @xmath84 for @xmath35 .",
    "the chain is either a pure helix or a pure coil . for intermediate values of @xmath37 ,",
    "the plot of @xmath47 _ vs. _ @xmath32 yields a sigmoid curve with a transition region of width @xmath85 centered around @xmath86 .",
    "the number of domains is maximal in the vicinity of @xmath33 and it decreases with @xmath37 .",
    "the parameter @xmath87 serves as a measure of the temperature , @xmath31 . for low temperatures , @xmath88 and",
    "the polymer is mainly in a helical state . at high temperatures , @xmath89 and",
    "the polymer is mostly in a coil state .",
    "the crossover occurs at @xmath90 for which @xmath86 .",
    "near this crossover , @xmath91 and the width of the crossover regime is @xmath92 .",
    "the most notable feature of the force laws of homopolypeptides are the plateaus . in this section",
    "we present qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of the plateaus .",
    "each plateau in the force law corresponds to a coexistence between two states , a helix and a coil .",
    "the situation is somewhat analogous to a liquid - gas transition which leads to a plateau in the pressure - volume diagram . in our case",
    ", the tension @xmath1 plays the role of the pressure and the end - to - end distance @xmath2 is analogous to the volume .",
    "this analogy is however of limited validity since the homopolypeptides are one - dimensional systems with short range interactions and thus incapable of undergoing a first order phase transition . in such systems",
    "the boundary free energy is independent of the size of the domain . as a result , a first order phase transition involving a coexistence of two domains is prevented by the mixing entropy  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the average domain sizes @xmath64 and @xmath93 , as obtained in the previous section , are independent of the size of the chain , @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , the main features of the system can be recovered if one ignores the role of the mixing entropy . as expected , within this rough approximation the plateaus",
    "are erroneously associated with first order phase transitions . in spite of this deficiency",
    ", this approximation recovers the correct length and force scales but the force laws obtained are wrong in detail .",
    "before we present this approximation we investigate the crossing of the free energy curves associated with the `` pure '' helix and coil states .",
    "this is a rough diagnostic for first order phase transitions . in our case",
    "it provides an insight concerning the physical origin of the plateaus as well as a reasonable estimate for some of the length and force scales involved .",
    "the occurrence of the plateaus is signaled by the crossing of the free energy curves of the pure helix and the pure coil as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "each crossing point signals a coexistence between the two `` phases '' and thus a plateau in the force law .    with the unperturbed coil as a reference state ,",
    "the free energy of the coil is simply its elastic free energy . in this section",
    ", we will utilize the fixed @xmath2 ensemble and we thus denote the elastic free energy by @xmath94 . to allow for the finite extensibility of the chain we use the freely jointed chain ( fjc ) model ( appendix c ) for @xmath94 and",
    "the free energy per monomer is @xmath95 where @xmath96 $ ] , @xmath97 is the reduced end - to - end distance of the polymer and @xmath98 is the reduced force . @xmath99 and @xmath100 are related _ via _ @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the langevin function .",
    "the free energy of the helix reflects two contributions .",
    "first is the excess free energy of a helix , @xmath103 . in the limit of an infinite chain ,",
    "when the contribution of the terminal monomers is negligible , the free energy per monomer is @xmath104 . at this stage",
    "we assume that the persistence length of the helix is infinite and that it may be viewed as a perfectly rigid and unextendable rod .",
    "within this view , extending the helix beyond its natural length is associated with an infinite free energy penalty .",
    "this penalty is important because the helix is shorter than the fully extended coil .",
    "as noted earlier , the contribution of each helical monomer to the overall length of the helix is @xmath105 .",
    "altogether , @xmath104 so long as @xmath106 while in the range @xmath107 it is @xmath108 .",
    "three scenarios are now possible ( fig .",
    "[ crossing ] ) . at low temperatures , @xmath109 and @xmath34 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath110 while @xmath111 . in this regime",
    "the helix is more stable than the coil .",
    "when @xmath107 the free energy of the helix diverges and the coil state becomes preferable .",
    "this curve crossing corresponds to a plateau involving the breakdown of the helix due to the applied tension . above the melting temperature , for @xmath112 and @xmath113",
    "the unstretched polypeptide is in a coil state . upon stretching @xmath114 increases and eventually intersects with @xmath115",
    "this intersection signals a plateau in the force law due to the formation of helical domains . at @xmath116",
    "the free energies @xmath114 and @xmath115 cross again because of the infinite free energy of a helix with @xmath107 .",
    "this second intersection signals a second plateau involving the melting of the helix and the formation of coil domains .",
    "finally , for sufficiently high temperatures , @xmath117 , no intersections occur and the polypeptide remains in a coil state for all @xmath99 values .",
    "the threshold temperature for this regime , @xmath118 , is defined by the equality @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the free energy of a stretched coil with @xmath116 .",
    "the intersection of the free energy curves provides a rough indicator for the occurrence of plateaus in the force law .",
    "however , it does not allow to calculate an explicit force - extension diagram .",
    "a simple approach yielding the main features of the force law is the @xmath6 or diblock approximation  @xcite . within this approximation the force law",
    "is calculated for a diblock copolymer with one helical domain and one coil domain .",
    "the size of the annealed domains varies with the extension and is determined by the equilibrium conditions . as is implied by its name , in this approximation @xmath121",
    "is neglected . as expected ,",
    "setting @xmath6 leads to a first order phase transition associated with a coexistence of two `` phases '' .",
    "consequently , some features of the force law are wrong .",
    "in particular , this approximation yields a perfect plateau with @xmath122 while in reality @xmath1 increases weakly with @xmath2 . these features notwithstanding , this simple approximation does recover the correct length and force scales . within this discussion",
    "we will also briefly examine the effect of the persistence length of the helical domains .",
    "in particular we compare the behavior of a helix endowed with an infinite persistence length to that of a helix with a finite one .    within the @xmath6 or diblock approximation",
    "the free energy @xmath123 of the chain is    @xmath124    here , the first term allows for the excess free energy of the helical monomers . since @xmath6 the helical and coil phases separate into two domains .",
    "the `` interfacial '' free energy of the single helical domain gives rise to the second , constant term .",
    "these two terms are supplemented by an elastic free energy @xmath125 that depends on @xmath47 , @xmath126 and the end - to - end distance , @xmath2 .",
    "different versions of the @xmath6 are possible , depending on the choice of @xmath125 . in the following we focus on the simplest version where @xmath125 is given by the gaussian elasticity of an ideal random coil in the fixed @xmath2 ensemble .",
    "two additional assumptions are invoked : ( i ) the helical domain is perfectly rigid and unextendable and ( ii ) the helical domain is perfectly aligned with the applied force .",
    "these assumptions specify the elastic free energy per monomer @xmath127 this simple version of the diblock approximation permits an explicit analytical solution for the force law .",
    "the corresponding equilibrium condition is @xmath128 within this approximation the equilibrium condition @xmath129 is an identity yielding no additional information .",
    "the solution of this quadratic equation in @xmath130 is @xmath131 .",
    "this defines a critical @xmath17 @xmath132 corresponding to a critical @xmath133 or @xmath118 . while @xmath134 , the equilibrium condition can not be satisfied , that is , the polypeptide remains in a coil state irrespective of the imposed tension .",
    "a critical point occurs for @xmath135 .",
    "when @xmath136 two solutions exist , each defining a plateau in the force _ vs. _ extension curve .",
    "the solution @xmath137 corresponds to the lower plateau , obtained for @xmath138 , where @xmath139 this first regime disappears for @xmath140 or @xmath5 .",
    "the condition @xmath84 defines a lower boundary of the plateau , @xmath141 @xmath142 increases as @xmath17 increases until @xmath143 for @xmath135 .",
    "for @xmath144 the fraction of helices is @xmath84 and the chain is in a purely coil form .",
    "the upper boundary of this plateau occurs at @xmath145 when the chain is fully helical , @xmath83 . at intermediate extensions , @xmath146 the fraction of helical bonds increases as @xmath147 and @xmath148 occurs at the midpoint of the plateau @xmath149 .",
    "the equilibrium free energy of the chain for @xmath144 is @xmath150 while for @xmath151 it is @xmath152 the second plateau , is described by the solution , @xmath153 , leading to @xmath154 the lower boundary of this plateau occurs at @xmath155 when @xmath83 .",
    "the upper boundary , when @xmath84 , occurs at @xmath156 for @xmath157 the fraction of helical monomers decreases as @xmath158 and @xmath148 occurs at the midpoint of the plateau @xmath159 .",
    "notice that the width of the two plateaus shrinks as @xmath160 or @xmath161 .",
    "for @xmath162 the fraction of monomers in a helical state is again @xmath84 and the corresponding free energy is @xmath150 .",
    "the equilibrium free energy of the chain in the range @xmath163 is @xmath164 note that only the lower plateau is obtained if @xmath165 is assumed@xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 approximation allowed us to obtain rough force laws corresponding to the three scenarios identified by the curve crossing argument .",
    "thus , for @xmath134 or @xmath117 , the polypeptide remains in a coil configuration for the whole range of extension .",
    "the `` two plateau scenario '' occurs for @xmath136 corresponding to @xmath166 or @xmath167 .",
    "in this case we can distinguish five regimes ( fig .",
    "[ phases ] ) : ( i ) for low extensions the chain is in a coil state , @xmath84 , and the elastic behavior is gaussian leading to @xmath168 .",
    "( ii ) in the range @xmath146 helix and coil domains coexist according to the lever rule @xmath169 . this coexistence is associated with a plateau with a constant tension @xmath170 ( iii ) at @xmath171 the force curve exhibits a discontinuity associated with a step like increase to a second plateau .",
    "the magnitude of the step , @xmath172 is @xmath173 ( iv ) in the range @xmath157 helix and coil domains coexist according to the lever rule @xmath174 .",
    "this coexistence is associated with a second plateau with a constant tension @xmath175 ( v ) finally , for @xmath176 the chain is in a strongly stretched coil state obeying @xmath168 .    when @xmath177 or @xmath178 the unperturbed chain is in a helical state .",
    "consequently , the lower plateau disappears .",
    "it is replaced by a `` quasi plateau '' which is not associated with a helix - coil coexistence .",
    "rather , it is due to the facile orientation of the helical chain which is modeled as a rigid rod . at @xmath116",
    "a jump occurs to the upper plateau .",
    "the analysis presented above utilized the gaussian elastic free energy in the fixed @xmath2 ensemble to describe the coil .",
    "while this allows us to obtain explicit expressions for all the characteristics of the force curve , it also introduces errors .",
    "clearly , this choice of @xmath125 does not capture the behavior of the coil in the high extension regime , where finite extensibility begins to play a role . as a result ,",
    "the values of @xmath179 are overestimated .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , within this approximation the span of the two plateaus are equal @xmath180 while for more realistic choice of @xmath125 the higher plateau is narrower . a second more important",
    "pathology is the disappearance of regime ( v ) in the @xmath181 case .    to allow for the finite extensibility it is necessary to use the freely jointed chain model ( fjc ) for the coil segment  @xcite .",
