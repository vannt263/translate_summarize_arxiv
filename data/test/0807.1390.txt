    "@xcite , was observed in numerical simulations of both su(2 ) @xcite and su(3 ) @xcite lattice gauge theories .",
    "finally , at asymptotic distances , the string tensions depend only on the @xmath2-ality @xmath3 of the representation : representations with @xmath4 are screened and their potentials are asymptotically flat , @xmath5 representations are confined and their potentials continue to rise linearly .    a confinement scenario which naturally accounts for both casimir scaling at intermediate distances and the asymptotic @xmath2-ality dependence",
    "is based on condensation of center vortices in the qcd vacuum ( see @xcite for a review and summary of numerical evidence for the model ) . the vacuum is filled with percolating thick vortices carrying color magnetic flux quantized in terms of elements of the gauge group center . asymptotically large wilson loops , linked to center vortices , `` feel '' the total ( center ) flux ; this is how @xmath2-ality shows up easily in asymptotic string tensions . on the other hand , wilson loops of intermediate size",
    "cross thick - vortex cores and enclose only a part of their magnetic flux . as a consequence",
    ", intermediate string tensions can exhibit approximate casimir scaling . a simple model of how and why it happens , was suggested in ref .  @xcite ( some numerical support was provided by @xcite ) .    recently ,",
    "g@xmath0  yang  mills theory has attracted considerable attention @xcite as a means to look at the physics of confinement from a fresh new angle .",
    "the g@xmath0  group has a trivial center ; the center of its universal covering group is also trivial@xcite , and there seems to be no reason to believe that the group center plays any important role in g@xmath0  gauge theory at all . in the strict sense of the word",
    "the theory is only _ temporarily _ confining , since potentials for static color charges from any representation , including the fundamental one , must be asymptotically flat .",
    "unlike su(@xmath2 ) , even a `` quark '' from the fundamental ( \\{7 } ) representation of g@xmath0  can be screened by a bunch of `` gluons '' ( from the 14-dimensional adjoint representation ) . however",
    ", this fact does not really contradict the center - vortex confinement scenario : g@xmath0  does not possess non - trivial center vortices , and the asymptotic string tension is zero if they are not present . as argued by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , the g@xmath0  temporary vs.  permanent confinement issue is more semantics than physics ; the really important point is that even in the g@xmath0  gauge theory one expects the static potentials grow linearly over a certain range of distances , from the scale where perturbation theory breaks to the onset of screening .",
    "the linear rise of the fundamental potential in this intermediate region was clearly demonstrated in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "all asymptotic string tensions are zero in g@xmath0   what about casimir scaling at intermediate distances ?",
    "dimensional reduction could be invoked to argue in its favor . however , if it holds true and if finite thickness of center vortices was able to explain successfully casimir scaling in su(@xmath2 ) , what can it be attributed to in a theory with trivial center ?",
    "is there any origin of casimir scaling common for `` centerless '' and `` centerful '' gauge models ?",
    "the answer given in @xcite was affirmative , the authors provided a model  an extension and improvement of that of ref .",
    "@xcite  in which the yang  mills vacuum state has a domain structure , with the color magnetic flux in each domain quantized in units of the gauge group center ( be it trivial or not ) , and casimir scaling results from random spatial fluctuations of the flux in each domain .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to subject the casimir - scaling hypothesis and predictions of the model of @xcite to a test in numerical simulations of g@xmath0  gauge theory on a four - dimensional euclidean lattice .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec : model ] , we will briefly summarize elements of the model .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : preliminaries ] , we sum up a few facts about the exceptional g@xmath0  group , explain the applied lattice methods , and present a subset of technical details on the enhancement of the ground - state overlap via smearing , and the determination of renormalized anisotropies .",
    "section [ sec : potentials ] summarizes results , in particular subsection [ subsec : fundamental ] the fundamental representation potential , while [ subsec : higher ] potentials for higher representations .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion and summary ( sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "a few technicalities are relegated to appendices .",
    "an essential element of the derivation of casimir scaling in the @xmath6 yang  mills theory is the following : the ym action is quadratic in the field strength tensor @xmath7 , contains no derivatives of or constraints on @xmath7 , therefore field strengths of vacuum fluctuations in different points are uncorrelated , and disorder all - representation wilson loops .",
    "this can not be true for an effective action in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "even though the leading term of a derivative expansion of the yang  mills effective action is again quadratic in field strengths @xcite , the fields are constrained by bianchi identities and higher - order corrections contain derivatives .",
    "this is not a drawback , but desired : constraints and derivative terms must somehow contrive , in @xmath8 dimensions , to change the proportionality of string tensions to quadratic casimirs to the asymptotic @xmath2-ality dependence .    in the simple model of ref .",
    "@xcite it is assumed that if we take a 2d slice of the four - dimensional volume , we can split it into ( partly ) overlapping domains ( `` patches '' ) of a typical area @xmath9 . within each domain color",
    "magnetic fields fluctuate randomly and ( almost ) independently , with a short length of correlation @xmath10 .",
    "each domain is a bunch of small independently fluctuating subregions of area @xmath11 .",
    "the only weak constraint on fluctuating fields bounds the total integrated magnetic flux over each domain to correspond to an element of the center of the gauge group . in su(2 ) , there are two types of domains , of the center - vortex type and of the vacuum type .",
    "the former correspond to the nontrivial element of the center , @xmath12 , and represent a cross section of a thick center vortex ; the latter carry a zero total magnetic flux . in g@xmath0  all domains will be of the vacuum type , since the center contains the identity element only .",
    "how to distinguish overlapping vacuum domains in 2d snapshots of the g@xmath0  vacuum remains an unresolved task for future reflection and/or numerical experiments .    without going into details ,",
    "let s briefly summarize conclusions of the model .",
    "if the center of the gauge group contains @xmath2 elements , there are @xmath2 types of vacuum domains enumerated by the value @xmath13 , each assumed to appear with a probability @xmath14 centered at any given plaquette in the plane of the loop .",
    "the effect of a domain ( a 2d cross section of the @xmath3th vortex ) on a planar wilson loop is to multiply the loop by a group element @xmath15\\ ; \\mathcal{s}^\\dagger,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 are generators of the cartan subalgebra , @xmath17 is a random element of the group , and angles @xmath18 depend on the location of the vortex / domain with respect to the loop . if the domain is all contained within the loop area , then @xmath19=z_k\\mathbb{i},\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the @xmath3th element of the center , @xmath21 is the unit element .",
    "if the domain is outside the loop , it has no effect on the wilson loop , _ i.e. _ @xmath19=\\mathbb{i}.\\ ] ] for a wilson loop from the representation @xmath22 , the averaged contribution of a domain is simply @xmath23\\right)\\ ; \\mathbb{i}_{d_r},\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the dimension of the representation @xmath22 and @xmath25 is the @xmath26 unit matrix .",
    "one further assumes that probabilities to find domains of any type centered at two different plaquettes are independent , and that for loops smaller than the typical size of the domain , the r.m.s .  of phases",
    "@xmath27 is proportional to the area of the vortex contained in the interior of the loop .",
    "then it is a simple exercise to show that , both in su(@xmath2 ) and g@xmath0 , the static potential @xmath28 of the representation @xmath22 will be linearly rising for distances @xmath29 , with a string tension approximately proportional to its quadratic casimir : @xmath30 for very large wilson loops most vortices will be contained within the loop , the average phases are proportional to the corresponding total magnetic flux through the domain , and the prediction is , for @xmath31 @xmath32\\qquad\\mbox{(asymptotic distances)}\\ ] ] for su(@xmath2 ) , where @xmath33 is the @xmath2-ality of the representation  @xmath22 , and @xmath34 for the g@xmath0  gauge group .",
    "the function @xmath35 above depends also on the set of probabilities @xmath36 ; these can be tuned to get a desired form of @xmath3-scaling of asymptotic string tensions ( see @xcite for a discussion of this point ) .",
    "thus , the domain model of the ym vacuum with magnetic disorder @xcite , containing only a handful of adjustable parameters , predicts casimir scaling of higher representation potentials at intermediate distances _ both _ for su(@xmath2 ) and ( centerless ) g@xmath0  gauge theory . to verify the prediction for g@xmath0 , numerical simulations of the theory in lattice formulation are the appropriate tool",

    "alice , in lewis carroll s _ through the looking - glass , and what alice found there _ , enters a garden , where flowers speak to her and mistake her for a flower .",
    "does the gauge theory with the exceptional group g@xmath0  belong to the same species of flowers with `` ordinary '' confining su(@xmath2 ) gauge theories , or is it different and only mistaken for a flower ?",
    "many results of recent investigations suggest the answer that all non - abelian gauge theories , including g@xmath0 , share many properties in the infrared .",
    "thermodynamic properties are similar  @xcite , and ref .",
    "@xcite provided further numerical evidence : a qualitative agreement among landau - gauge ghost and gluon propagators and the faddeev ",
    "popov operator eigenspectrum in su(2 ) , su(3 ) and g@xmath0  gauge theories , though only in two and three euclidean dimensions .    from the point of view of the center - vortex confinement mechanism",
    ", theories also behave similarly . when center vortices are present and percolate , in theories with non - trivial center , they cause the expected @xmath2-ality dependence of asymptotic string tensions for static potentials for color charges from different representations of the gauge group . in a theory with trivial center ,",
    "the asymptotic string tension for all representations is zero .",
    "but even if a centerless theory possesses no non - trivial center - vortex - like objects , its vacuum can contain domain structures . ref .",
    "@xcite suggested a universal and simple model in which such vacuum domains  assuming color magnetic fields fluctuating almost independently in each domain , only fulfilling a constraint that the total flux corresponds to an element of the center  cause casimir scaling of static potentials in the intermediate distance interval , until color screening sets on .",
    "casimir scaling was observed in lattice simulations of su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge theories long ago , the model prediction called for verification also in the g@xmath0  lattice gauge theory",
    ".    our results convincingly demonstrate ( approximate ) casimir scaling for static potentials between color charges from the six lowest representations of g@xmath0 .",
    "the agreement between measured values of intermediate string tensions with predictions based on values of quadratic casimirs is quite striking , they differ by at most 1015% , and this can hardly be just a numerical coincidence .",
    "the results of course can not _",
    "prove _ that the model is right , but combined with the solid evidence for casimir scaling in su(2 ) and su(3 ) provide support for its main ingredients ( common for all groups )  magnetically disordered vacuum with a domain structure .",
    "how to identify such domains is another question ; in theories with non - trivial center one can apply the method of center projection in the maximal center gauge  @xcite , thus fitting extended ( `` thick '' ) vacuum structures by thin center vortices .",
    "the identification of vacuum - type domains with trivial total flux remains problematic .",
    "the observed casimir scaling , coming out so naturally within models with magnetic disorder and vacuum domain structure , may pose a challenge to approaches that invoke disparate ideas to explain the phenomenon of confinement .",
    "the g@xmath0  algebra for our representation ( based on @xcite ) is defined by the following generators : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "the generators are normalized to satisfy : @xmath43",
