    "the problem of solute transport in porous media is relevant to many environmental , water supply and industrial processes  @xcite .",
    "in addition , tracer dispersion is a useful tool to analyse porous media heterogeneities  @xcite .",
    "solute dispersion is often measured by monitoring solute concentration variations at the outlet of the sample following a pulse or step - like injection at the inlet : understanding fully the dispersion mechanisms requires however informations on the local concentration distribution and on local mixing at the pore scale .",
    "these goals can be reached by using nmr - imaging , cat - scan or acoustical techniques  @xcite : however , such techniques are either costly or have a limited resolution . in addition , they often put strong constraints on the characteristics of the fluid pairs .",
    "we have chosen instead in the present work to use a @xmath9 transparent square network of ducts of random widths allowing for easy visualizations of mixing and transport processes at the local scale .",
    "similar systems were previously used successfully to investigate two phase flows  @xcite and miscible displacements of newtonian fluids  @xcite .",
    "+ the key feature of the present experiments is to combine macroscopic and local scale measurements to estimate the influence of pore scale processes on dispersion . for this purpose , dye is used as a solute and high resolution maps of the relative concentration distribution are obtained through calibrated light absorption measurements .",
    "this allows one to determine quantitatively the global dispersion coefficient @xmath10 and the dispersivity @xmath3 while measuring simultaneously the time lag between the invasion of channels parallel and transverse to the mean flow .",
    "further informations are also obtained from the complex geometry of an isoconcentration line .",
    "+ this approach have allowed us to observe a change of dispersion regime for a pclet number of the order of @xmath11 while the local measurements suggest interpretations in terms of variations of the degree of mixing at the junctions .",
    "this confirms previous suggestions  @xcite on the influence of mixing at the pore scale on macroscopic dispersion . +",
    "another feature of our experiments is the use of shear thinning polymer solutions of the type encountered in many industrial processes in petroleum , chemical and civil engineering  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these practical applications , previous measurements at the laboratory scale on glass bead packings have shown  @xcite a significant enhancement of tracer dispersion compared to the newtonian case .",
    "this enhancement depends on the polymer concentration and will represent a useful additional input for our interpretations .",
    "in homogeneous @xmath12 porous media , the macroscopic concentration @xmath13 of a tracer ( i.e. averaged over a representative elementary volume ) satisfies the convection - diffusion equation : @xmath14 where @xmath10 is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient , @xmath15 the mean velocity of the fluid ( parallel to @xmath16 ) and @xmath13 is assumed to be constant in a section of the sample normal to * u*. in the following , equation  ( [ eq : condiff ] ) is shown to be also valid for the transparent model used in the present work .",
    "+ the value of @xmath10 is determined by two main physical mechanisms : molecular diffusion and advection by the complex velocity field inside the medium ( the local flow velocity varies both inside individual flow channels and from one channel to another ) .",
    "the relative order of magnitude of these two effects is characterized by the pclet number : @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the molecular diffusion coefficient and @xmath19 a characteristic length of the medium , here the average channel width ) . + various dispersion regimes are observed in usual porous media  @xcite . at very low pclet numbers ( @xmath20 ) , molecular diffusion is dominant and smoothes out local concentration variations .",
    "+ at higher @xmath4 values , the distribution of the channel widths induces short range variations of the magnitude and the direction of the local velocity .",
    "one can then consider that tracer particles experience a random walk inside the pore volume with a velocity varying both in magnitude and direction relative to the mean flow velocity @xmath21 .",
    "the typical length @xmath22 of the channels represents the length of the steps and their characteristic duration @xmath23 is @xmath24 .",
    "a classical feature of random walks is that the corresponding diffusion coefficient ( here equal to @xmath10 ) satisfies @xmath25 .",
    "the proportionality constant depends both on the disorder of the medium and on the rheology of the fluid . in this so - called _ geometrical dispersion _ , the coefficient @xmath10 should then be proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "+ the @xmath9 networks of interest in the present work have several specific features and @xmath10 should be very much influenced by the redistribution of the incoming tracer between the channels leaving a junction .",
    "this redistribution strongly depends on the local structure of the flow field and on the pclet number  @xcite . at low @xmath4 values ,",
    "the transit time through a junction is large enough for tracer to cross streamlines by molecular diffusion and one may assume a perfect mixing . in the other limit @xmath26 ,",
    "molecular diffusion is negligible : the path of the tracer particles coincides with the flow lines and is determined by the flow field in the junctions and by the location of the particles in the flow section .",
    "+ in the case of @xmath9 networks with small variations of the channel apertures , the flow field is close to that in a periodic square channel with a mean flow parallel to one of the axis : the major part of the flow is localized in longitudinal channels parallel to the axis where the velocity is high while that in transverse channels is small .",
    "tracer particles remain then inside sequences of channels parallel to the mean flow for a long distance without moving sideways .",
    "taylor - like dispersion  @xcite similar to that encountered in capillary tubes , between parallel plates or inside periodic structures may then develop : it corresponds to a balance between ( a ) spreading due to velocity gradients between the centers of the flow channels and their walls and ( b ) molecular diffusion across the flow lines .",
    "the increased dispersion in 2d periodic networks when flow is parallel to one of the axis  @xcite may for instance result from a combination of geometrical and taylor dispersion . + another issue of the present work is the influence of the shear - thinning properties of the fluids",
    ". they may influence the dispersion process in different ways : on the one hand , when the viscosity @xmath27 decreases with the shear rate @xmath28 , the velocity profile in individual channels becomes flat in the center of the channel . in simple geometries like capillary tubes ,",
    "the corresponding taylor dispersion coefficient @xmath10 is then lower than for a newtonian fluid although one has still @xmath29  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical investigations suggest that the flow of shear thinning fluids is localized in a smaller number of flow paths than for newtonian fluids  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "geometrical dispersion reflecting the distribution of the local velocities should increase as is indeed observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "a key point is here the influence of the fluid rheology on tracer mixing at the intersections between channels : to our knowledge , no previous experimental or numerical work has dealt with this issue which is an important point .",
    "the model porous medium is a two dimensional square network of channels of random aperture : these models have been realized by casting a transparent resin on a photographically etched mold as described in ref .",
    "the model contains a square network of @xmath30 channels with an individual length equal to @xmath31  mm and a depth of @xmath32  mm ; the width follows a discrete , log - normal distribution with @xmath33 values between @xmath34 and @xmath35  mm ( the average width is @xmath36 and its standard deviation @xmath37  mm ) . the mesh size of the network is equal to @xmath38  mm .",
    "the overall size of the model is @xmath39  mm and the two facing lateral sides are sealed . on the two others , the channels",
    "are directly connected to the outside .",
    "the total pore volume is close to @xmath40  mm@xmath41 . following the definition of bruderer _ et al _",
    "@xcite , the degree of heterogeneity of the network can be caracterized by the normalized standard deviation @xmath42 . in the present work : @xmath43 .",
    "the fluids used in the experiments are shear thinning water - polymer solutions .",
    "the shear thinning fluids are solutions of @xmath0 to @xmath1  ppm of high molecular weight scleroglucan in high purity water ( millipore - milli - q grade ) .",
    "scleroglucan ( sanofi bioindustries , france ) is a polysaccharide with a semi rigid molecule ( persistence length @xmath44  m ) ; it has been selected because it is electrically neutral and its characteristics are therefore independent of the ion ( and dye ) concentration .",
    "all solutions are protected from bacterial contamination by adding @xmath45  g / l of @xmath46 . in all experiments ,",
    "the injected and displaced fluids are identical except for a small amount of water blue dye which is added to one of the solutions at a concentration of @xmath47  ppm by weight to allow for optical concentration measurements . + the molecular diffusion coefficient of the dye is determined independently in pure water by means of taylor dispersion measurements performed separately in a capillary tube ( the measured value of @xmath18 was close to @xmath48  mm@xmath49.s@xmath50 . )",
    "+ the rheological properties of the scleroglucan solutions have been characterized using a _",
    "contraves ls30 _ couette rheometer with shear rates @xmath28 ranging from @xmath51  s@xmath50 up to @xmath52  s@xmath50 .",
    "the rheological properties of the solutions have been verified to be constant with time within experimental error ( over a time lapse of @xmath53 days ) and identical for dyed and transparent solutions with the same polymer concentrations .",
    "the variation of the effective viscosity @xmath54 with @xmath28 was then adjusted by a carreau function : @xmath55 the values of these different rheological parameters for the polymer solutions used in the present work are listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] ; determining @xmath56 would have required values of @xmath28 outside the measurement range so that we assume that @xmath57  pa.s ( the value for the solvent i.e. water ) . in eq.([powervisc ] ) , @xmath58 corresponds to a crossover between two regimes . on the one hand , @xmath59 , the viscosity @xmath54 tends towards @xmath60 , and",
    "the fluid displays a newtonian behavior ( `` newtonian plateau '' regime ) . on the other hand , for @xmath61 , the effective viscosity decreases with the shear rate following the power law @xmath62 ( @xmath63 for a newtonian fluid . )",
    "it should finally be noted that the high effective viscosity of these solutions at low shear rates avoids the appearance of buoyancy induced instabilities at low shear rates and helps stabilize the fluid displacement .",

    "this operation is performed only on pixels belonging to channels ; non flowing domains are not considered .",

    "this shows that there are no large scale heterogeneities of the network , such as high or low permeability channels of width significantly larger than the mesh size which would increase the dispersivity .",
    "+ since all data points correspond to @xmath135 , the _ direct _ influence on longitudinal dispersion of molecular diffusion is negligible : it has however a strong indirect influence at the lower pclet numbers investigated ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "the transit time of the tracer inside the junctions or individual flow channels is then large enough so that molecular diffusion across the flow lines is significant : this influences strongly the redistribution of the incoming tracer between channels leaving each junction  @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we show that , in addition to the determination of macroscopic parameters like @xmath15 , @xmath10 ( or @xmath3 ) , the concentration maps allow to investigate mixing processes at the pore scale or even below .",

    "the difference @xmath139 is negative when the line located at the distance @xmath101 from the inlet , and over which @xmath140 is computed , contains only longitudinal channels parallel to the flow ; it is positive when the line contains both transverse channels and junctions .",
    "regarding @xmath110 , it is also lower than the mean value when the line @xmath141 contains only longitudinal channels and higher when it contains both longitudinal and transverse channels .",
    "the variations of @xmath137 reflect the different influence of longitudinal and transverse channels on transport . as already discussed in section  [ dismech ] , in a weakly disordered square network like the present one , most convective flux is localized inside the longitudinal channels ( parallel to the mean flow ) .",
    "the mean velocity inside them is then significantly higher than in the transverse channels and they get saturated faster with the displacing fluid .",
    "there is therefore a time lag between the saturation of the transverse and longitudinal channels at a same distance @xmath101 from the inlet which explains the oscillations of @xmath137 in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] .",

    "therefore the time lag for @xmath145 lines containing transverse channels should reflect directly the residence time in an individual ( slow ) transverse channel , weighted by the volume fraction corresponding to these channels .",

    "this increase of the absolute values of the time lags reflects very likely the breakdown of the assumption of perfect mixing at junctions or inside individual channels : at high pclet numbers , a solute particle may indeed flow through several junctions and channels without moving across flow lines through transverse molecular diffusion . if the lattice is weakly disordered , the solute may then remain for a longer time inside a sequence of longitudinal high velocity channels than in the case of a perfect mixing at the junctions : the corresponding value of @xmath150 will then be lower .",

    "+ although the transition between the above two regimes takes place at the same pclet number for both solutions , the absolute amplitude of the variations of @xmath143 and @xmath150 with @xmath148 is significantly larger for the @xmath1  ppm one .",
    "this is direct consequence of the shear thinning properties of the fluid : the effective viscosity of the solutions increases much more with the polymer concentration in slow transverse channels ( where the shear rate is low ) than in fast longitudinal ones : as a result , the contrast between the velocities ( and therefore the residence times ) in the longitudinal and transverse channels is enhanced , leading to the observed increase of @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "this enhancement of velocity contrasts for shear thinning fluids is discussed in more detail in section  [ disc ] .",

    ", we shall not use the full spatial concentration distribution in the following analysis : we chose instead to characterize its spatial heterogeneity by the isoconcentration lines @xmath172 , which are assumed to reflect the _ displacement front _ geometry : examples of such fronts determined by a thresholding procedure are displayed in figures  [ fig : fig8 ] and  [ fig : fig9 ] for pclet numbers @xmath4 respectively equal to @xmath123 and @xmath173 .",
    "+ the width of the front parallel to the mean flow is larger for the more concentrated solution and it increases with the pclet number",
    ". also , at high @xmath4 values , large spikes are visible while the front is relatively smooth at lower ones . in spite of these differences ,",
    "the main geometrical features of the front are similar : large peaks and troughs are generally located at the same points for different flow velocities and polymer concentrations .",
    "this confirms that irregularities of the front structure are associated to deterministic features of the velocity field and not to uncontrolled imperfections of the injection .",
    "+ quantitatively , the effective width of the front parallel to the flow is characterized in the following by the standard deviation @xmath174 of the distance @xmath16 of its points from the inlet : @xmath174 satisfies @xmath175 in which @xmath176 is the mean value of @xmath16 . in figures  [ fig : fig8 ] and",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] , @xmath176 is equal to half the length of the model and the values of @xmath177 corresponding to the curves displayed are listed in the captions .     as a function of the mean front velocity @xmath15  ( mm / s ) for a mean distance @xmath178 and polymer concentrations equal to @xmath1  ppm ( @xmath113 ) and @xmath0  ppm ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "solid ( resp .",
    "dotted ) lines : fit of the experimental data for a @xmath1  ppm ( resp .",
    "ppm ) polymer solution by equation @xmath179 with @xmath180 and @xmath181 ( resp . @xmath182 and @xmath183 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : fig10 ] displays the variation of @xmath177 as a function of the mean flow velocity @xmath15 for @xmath184 . for both solutions ,",
    "the width @xmath177 increases logarithmically with @xmath15 : the value of @xmath177 is larger for the @xmath1  ppm solution while the slope of its variation with @xmath15 in figure  [ fig : fig10 ] is slightly lower .",
    "+ the values of @xmath177 are different for the two solutions because the effective viscosity decreases faster with the velocity gradients for the @xmath1  ppm solution than for the @xmath0  ppm one .",
    "the ratio between the effective viscosities , and therefore the velocities in the longitudinal and transverse channels is therefore higher and the front width which is directly related to this ratio increases . +",
    "the second major feature of the above results at high velocities is the large amplitude of the peaks and troughs observed on the front while they are smaller and narrower at lower velocities .",
    "this , too , may be explained by the reduced tracer mixing at junctions at high pclet numbers ( section  [ seci ] ) : solute remaining for a long distance inside longitudinal , high velocity , channels will contribute to the spikes while that moving through a sequence of slow lateral channels will contribute to the troughs . at lower pclet numbers , mixing is more efficient and solute particules sample more effectively the velocity distribution : this reduces the dispersion of the transit times and , therefore the amplitude of the peaks and troughs .",
    "the local analysis of the transit times and of the front geometry have therefore provided important informations on mixing inside junctions and flow channels and on its dependence on the pclet number .",
    "this information greatly helps one to interprete the macroscopic dispersivity measurements of section  [ sec : quant ] .",
    "some of the features observed are specific to 2d systems while others can occur in usual 3d media .",
    "+ at low pclet numbers ( typically @xmath185 ) , the dispersivity @xmath3 remains constant with @xmath4 and is lower for the @xmath0  ppm polymer solution than for the @xmath1  ppm one . in sections  [ seci ] and  [ sec : secii ] , we have seen that , in this regime , transverse mixing in junctions and channels is very effective so that the correlation length of the motion of solute particles is of the order of the length @xmath22 of individual channels . as a result",
    ", this motion may be described as a sequence of random steps of varying durations and directions inside the medium ; this is the geometrical dispersion regime discussed in section  [ dismech ] and for which @xmath125 ( @xmath186 ) .",
    "+ in this regime , the factor of two difference of the dispersivities for @xmath0 and @xmath1  ppm solutions is likely due to enhanced velocity contrasts between the fast and slow flow regions .",
    "it is known , for instance  @xcite , that the mean flow velocity inside a cylindrical channel under a given pressure gradient varies as the square of the radius @xmath19 for a newtonian fluid and as @xmath187 for a shear thinning fluid verifying equation  ( [ powervisc ] ) .",
    "let us assume that the pressure gradient between the ends of flow channels in parallel is constant . if @xmath188 , the standard deviation @xmath189 of the mean velocities in the different channels should scale like : @xmath190 where @xmath42 is the normalized standard deviation of the channel aperture ( see section  [ subsec : model ] ) . still using the same simplistic approach , the typical standard deviation @xmath191 of the transit time along a channel of length @xmath192  mm should be @xmath193 .",
    "estimating the dispersion coefficient @xmath10 from the relation @xmath194 provides the order of magnitude of the dispersivity : @xmath195 since @xmath64 decreases with the polymer concentration , @xmath3 should therefore increase for a fixed aperture fluctuation @xmath196 . using in equation  ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) the values of @xmath22 , @xmath196 and",
    "@xmath64 corresponding to the present experiments ( table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) leads to @xmath197  mm and @xmath38  mm respectively for the @xmath0  ppm and @xmath1  ppm solutions .",
    "these estimations are close to the experimental values @xmath198  mm and @xmath199  mm reported in section  [ sec0 ] for the same solutions ( figure  [ fig : fig6 ] )",
    ". the difference may be due to the assumption of identical pressure gradients on different parallel channels used to obtain equations  [ eq : eq3 ] and  [ eq : eq4 ] .",
    "+ at higher pclet numbers @xmath5 , @xmath3 is no longer constant but increases with @xmath4 .",
    "this reflects the transition towards a second dispersion regime in which mixing is less effective .",
    "one must then take into account the stretching of dye parallel to the flow by local velocity gradients in the flow section ( dye moves slower in the vicinity of the walls than in the center of the channels ) .",
    "this stretching effect , is balanced by transverse molecular diffusion , resulting a taylor - like dispersion mechanism ( section  [ dismech ] ) .",
    "this effect is made significant by the increase with @xmath4 of the correlation length of dye transport along chains of flow channels parallel to the mean flow discussed above in sections  [ seci ] and  [ sec : secii ] .",
    "+ the effect of the local velocity gradients is also enhanced by the specific topology of @xmath9 micromodels .",
    "the upper and lower walls are indeed continuous and some flow lines remain close to them over their full length : as in taylor dispersion , slow solute particles near these walls may only move away from them through molecular diffusion . similarly , fast moving particles half way between the walls can only reach them through transverse molecular diffusion .",
    "the large correlation length of these velocity contrasts also results in taylor - like dispersion effects .",
    "+ yet , the influence of the disorder of the medium can not be completely neglected ( since some tracer always moves into lower velocity transverse channels ) : the global dispersion results therefore from the combined effects of geometrical and taylor dispersion . as a result",
    ", the macroscopic dispersion coefficient @xmath10 follows in this regime a power law @xmath200 of the pclet number with an exponent @xmath201 intermediate between the values @xmath38 and @xmath202 corresponding respectively to taylor and geometrical dispersion .",
    "+ regarding the influence of the shear thinning properties , increasing the polymer concentration enhances velocity contrasts between different flow channels while it flattens the velocity profile in individual channels .",
    "the first effect increases geometrical dispersion and is indeed observed at low pclet numbers .",
    "the second reduces taylor dispersion : this explains why , at higher @xmath4 values , the values of @xmath3 for the two polymer solutions are similar when the influence of taylor dispersion is large .",
    "+ to conclude , the dispersion measurements reported in the present work for transparent micromodels provide significant novel informations on the influence of the flow velocity and fluid rheology on miscible displacements in porous media .",
    "quantitative high resolution optical measurements have allowed for thorough studies over a broad range of length scales : it has in particular been possible in the same experiment both to determine macroscopic parameters such as the effective dispersivity and to analyse at the pore scale the dynamics of concentration variations .",
    "+ in particular , the local analysis of the time lag between the invasions of longitudinal and transverse channels of the model has allowed us to relate the transition between two dispersion regimes for @xmath203 to variations of mixing in channel junctions .",
    "the variations of small scale structures of the displacement front with the pclet number and the polymer concentration also provides informations on the spatial correlation of transport at the local scale . + in the future , investigation of these effects at still higher resolutions should allow for detailed direct studies of mixing and flow patterns right inside individual flow channels and their junctions .",
