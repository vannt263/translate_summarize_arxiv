    "ever since it became clear that earth s magnetosphere is influenced by the sun , significant effort has been devoted to establishing the relationship between fluctuations in the energy delivered by the solar wind to the magnetosphere and variations in the magnetospheric response . a particularly important diagnostic for the response has been the family of geomagnetic indices , especially the auroral electrojet index @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a common proxy for the solar wind input is the @xmath1 function @xcite which estimates the fraction of the solar wind poynting flux through the dayside magnetosphere .    one approach is to investigate causal relationships , and considerable sophistication has now been developed in this ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite;@xcite,@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , even without examining causality , significant information can be obtained by examining the scaling behaviour of fluctuations . a first analysis of this , in the fourier domain , was done by @xcite using the power spectrum .",
    "subsequent analyses have introduced other methods for detecting scale invariance ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite;@xcite,@xcite;@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "most recently @xcite , and @xcite , have studied the scaling collapse of the increments of time series .",
    "a fundamental problem has been raised by the evidence for multifractality in some solar wind quantities ( e. g. @xcite , and references therein ) and the @xmath0 index @xcite .",
    "multifractality is physically well motivated - at least for solar wind quantities - in that it arises naturally from the intermittency of multiplicative turbulent cascade models @xcite .",
    "multifractality would imply that the hurst s  roughness \" exponent @xmath2 is not constant but varies from scale to scale .",
    "this evidence for multifractality in the indices thus means that any comparison of pairs of scaling exponents derived from solar wind and geomagnetic indices may be problematic @xcite .",
    "preliminary comparisons of solar wind and geomagnetic field measurements made using multiscaling measures @xcite showed similarity at low orders after low pass filtering of the magnetospheric quantities .",
    "however , @xcite(2002 - 2005 ) , in examining a range of solar wind quantities , have recently found some apparent simplifications .",
    "they see the intriguing result that although some quantities ( notably @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) _ do not _ show a simple scaling collapse , consistent with their well - known multifractality , others ( such as @xmath5 ) _ do _ i.e. they are , in this sense , effectively monofractal .",
    "recently @xcite have extended the 1 year @xmath6 dataset studied by @xciteto the 10 years used by @xcite .",
    "they find that when such long auroral index datasets are examined , @xmath0 and @xmath1 do indeed have discernably different pdfs .",
    "such analyses are not easy to compare",
    ". some used overlapping index and solar wind time series @xcite , other did not @xcite .",
    "techniques which impose finite limits on the integral used to evaluate structure functions have also been explored ( @xcite and references therein ) . the choice of solar wind measures and geomagnetic time series has also varied .",
    "it seems to us thus imperative to try to start to reconcile the various studies and understand why some show much greater similarity between the solar wind signal and indices than others .",
    "we also believe that the synthesis of observations will help towards a goal we have proposed elsewhere : the definition of models which are either i ) simple , statistical ,  strawman \" models which may nonetheless capture some relevant fluctuation phenomenology e.g. the fractional lognormal model sketched by @xcite ) or ii ) more clearly statistical physics - based e.g. the generalised fokker - planck model of @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "by analogy with mathematical economics we may think of the type i models as modelling the  stylized facts \" of the coupled solar wind magnetospheric system @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall introduce one such model : fractional lvy motion @xcite , in order to see how well it can describe the solar wind @xmath1 function and the @xmath0 family of indices ( @xmath0 itself , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "preliminary comparison is made with some of the measurements listed above , and it is shown that the model provides a good quantitative explanation for the difference between two scaling exponents first noted in this context by @xcite as well as a possible qualitative explanation for the multifractal behaviour seen by @xcite .",
    "where relevant , the effect of the truncation ( finite variance ) implicit in both a natural data series and a computer model are noted .",
    "future directions are then sketched .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data are a 1 year subset of those studied by @xcite .",
    "they correspond to the years 1978 and 1995 respectively . as with @xcite solar wind data",
    "is taken only for periods when wind is definitely in the solar wind , see @xcite for details .",
    "we follow @xcite by firstly differencing the time series @xmath9 of the indices @xmath10 and @xmath1 at intervals @xmath11 of @xmath12 times the fundamental sampling period ( 1 minute for the indices and and 46 seconds for @xmath1 ) to generate difference time series @xmath13 . for further details of the dataset and preprocessing techniques see @xcite and references therein .",

    "fractional lvy motion can be defined using a riemann - liouville fractional integral generalising the better - known expression for fractional brownian motion @xcite .",
    "we here adapt the notation of equation 5 of @xcite , which defines a process @xmath17 :    @xmath18    equation ( [ eq : flm ] ) can be unpacked as a summation of lvy stable increments @xmath19 each weighted by a response function @xmath20 .",

    "keeping @xmath27 but allowing @xmath21 to vary in the range @xmath28 to @xmath29 describes slm .",

    "flm thus by construction exhibits both the sources of anomalous diffusion identified by mandelbrot above .",
    "these limits have corresponding simplified fractional kinetic equations ( fke ) for the pdf @xmath32 , see section 5.2 of @xcite .",
    "putting @xmath33 with @xmath34 , wbm is given by the diffusion equation @xmath35 ; fbm by @xmath36 ; and slm by @xmath37 .",
    "flm should thus correspond to equation ( 132 ) of @xcite : @xmath38 all cases have a fixed diffusion constant @xmath39 .",
    "future work is required to establish if this simplified form of equation ( 127 ) of @xcite , the full fke , can map on to the fokker - planck equation of @xcite or whether the full equation , including fractional drift and diffusion terms , is needed .",
    "after initial submission of this paper we also became aware of the relevance of the work of @xcite to the interpretation of flm as an fke ; see in particular their equation ( 3 ) .",
    "we now follow @xcite to show that @xmath17 is indeed an h - selfsimilar process . to see this we first put @xmath40 in ( [ eq : flm ] ) .",
    "we then use the fact that the increments @xmath41 are defined to be @xmath42 self - similar i.e. are equal in distribution ( @xmath43 ) to @xmath44 .",

    "only we recover the well known expression that @xmath47 . in the slm case @xmath27 and we find @xmath48 .",
    "recently @xcite has proposed writing @xmath49 where he defines a joseph ( long range dependence ) exponent @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and a noah ( heavy tail ) exponent @xmath52 ( = @xmath42 ) .",
    "the first property that needs to be shown in a time series for flm to be a candidate model is thus @xmath2-selfsimilarity .",
    "this can be tested by a number of methods .",
    "the first is scaling collapse , which was shown for the datasets in our paper by @xcite .",
    "an flm model also implies that the pdf of returns i.e @xmath53 will scale with @xmath11 with exponent also equal to @xmath2 .",
    "this was shown in fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "for convenience in figure 1 we show a comparison of the scaling regions of the 1 year signals taken from the natural time series @xmath54 and @xmath1 .",
    "all are seen to scale up to approximately @xmath55 minutes ( @xmath56 hour ) .",
    "caution is however necessary because in a natural dataset the moments @xmath57 would be expected to be dominated in the small @xmath11 limit by the scaling of the measurement noise on the differences @xmath14 rather than that of the physical variables themselves @xcite .",
    "interestingly , although the exponent needed to rescale the pdfs @xmath58 of differences @xmath14 taken from flm is the  full \" extended @xmath59 defined in equation ( [ eq : h ] ) , the difference pdfs have the same shape they would have for an slm with the same @xmath21 value .",
    "this is analogous to the way in which fbm retains the same gaussian distribution as the steps from which it is composed , despite their statistical dependence , and is why flm is also known as  linear fractional stable motion \" .",
    "one may extend the idea of self - similarity expressed by @xmath2 to the generalised q - th order structure functions @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath65 need not be integer . if a given @xmath60 is empirically found to be a power law we can then define an exponent @xmath61 from @xmath66 .    for a stable self - similar process where all moments are finite @xmath24 , i.e. wbm ( @xmath67 ) or fbm ( @xmath68 ) , the exponents of the structure functions @xmath61 follow @xmath69 , as we have checked by simulating an fbm using the same flm algorithm as used for the figures , in the @xmath24 limit . by definition",
    "we then have @xmath70 .",
    "additionally in these gaussian ( @xmath24 ) cases @xmath71 , which from equation ( [ eq : h ] ) then implies @xmath72 .",
    "the exponent derived from the pdf of returns can be shown to be equivalent to @xmath73 [ _ miriam forman , private communication , 2002 _ ] so for self - similar processes ( see also our figure 5 ) the plot of @xmath61 versus @xmath65 is antisymmetric about @xmath74 at least insofar as @xmath75 .",
    "because of the relation @xmath69 for wbm and fbm , a complementary estimate of the self - similarity parameter @xmath2 can , for these cases , be obtained from from the well - known growth of the standard deviation @xmath76 of the difference time series @xmath77 with differencing interval @xmath11 . indeed the growth of a measured @xmath78 as @xmath79 in the case of wbm defines diffusive behaviour .",
    "@xmath78 is the square root of variance and thus scales like @xmath80 , i.e. as @xmath81 , i.e. it follows mandelbrot s joseph exponent @xmath50 ( which from ( @xmath82 ) will be identical to @xmath2 in the gaussian wbm or fbm cases ) .    in the case of lvy motion ,",
    "however , whether ordinary or fractional , the @xmath83 order moments @xmath60 ( where @xmath84 ) taken from a set of @xmath85 data points are theoretically infinite as @xmath86 in contrast to the convergence seen for gaussians .",
    "it is thus not _ a priori _ obvious how the variance of a truncated , finite-@xmath85 , time series would be expected to scale .",
    "this is significant because any simulation that we perform of fractional lvy motion is effectively one of truncated lvy motion ; while a natural time series will also have a finite variance in practice .",
    "the possible relevance of this question to data is clearly illustrated by our figure ( [ figure3 ] ) , ( see also table 1 of @xcite ) in which @xmath78 for the solar wind variable @xmath1 is seen to scale with an exponent of 0.29 as opposed to the values around @xmath87 seen for the 3 geomagnetic index quantities .",
    "rather than scaling with @xmath2 , @xmath78 still appears to be showing pseudo - gaussian behaviour i.e. following @xmath50 , in that @xmath88 for this time series ( estimated by wavelet methods ) giving @xmath89 .",
    "the apparent disadvantage of the loss of a second , independent , estimate of @xmath2 seems to be compensated for by the possibility that we can use the growth of @xmath78 to measure @xmath25 i.e. we can effectively use it as a measurement of @xmath50 . on the assumption that a naturally truncated flm describes our data we can build a table ( table  [ sphericcase ] ) of the measured @xmath25 and @xmath2 values and then predict @xmath21 using equation ( [ eq : h ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on inspecting table i the first point is that the values of @xmath2 and @xmath50 are so close in the case of @xmath7 that if we assume they are exact the predicted @xmath21 becomes 2 , eliminating flm as a model for @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath2 is sub - diffusive , so fbm would remain a possible candidate model ; however the observed @xcite difference pdfs @xmath90 for @xmath7 are non - gaussian , eliminating fbm .",
    "the error bars quoted in table i suggest these conclusions may be too harsh .",
    "flm would , however , seem more suitable as a model for @xmath91 and @xmath1 .    as a test we may also consider the values of @xmath2 and @xmath50 for solar wind @xmath5 obtained by @xcite . their figure 3 gives @xmath92 in our parlance , while they report a scaling exponent for @xmath78 of 0.28 ( i.e. @xmath50 ) . inserting this into equation ( [ eq : h ] ) predicts @xmath93 , which is equivalent to the @xmath94 of their equation ( 3 ) ( see also their figure 4 ) which they find to be @xmath95 , encouragingly good agreement .",
    "we can then now simulate flm using parameters drawn from natural data to see if the inferences we have drawn above are indeed consistent , and to qualify flm as at least a possible proxy for these time series .",
    "we use the published algorithm of @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage of being linked more closely to the definition of flm from equation ( [ eq : flm ] ) than the ( faster ) approach of replacing @xcitea gaussian random number generator by a lvy generator in otherwise standard fourier filter methods @xcite .",
    "a comparison of these two approaches will be reported in a future paper .",
    "we show simulation results for synthetic @xmath8 and @xmath1 time series .",
    "these were specified by the ordered pairs @xmath96 of ( 1.86,1.88 ) and ( 1.58,1.51 ) respectively .",
    "the @xmath97 scaling for both series ( figure [ figure4 ] ) is seen to follow @xmath2 as we expect , so both model series have very similar measured @xmath2 values , as we also saw in their natural counterparts ( figure ( [ figure1 ] ) ) .",
    "conversely , for finite samples of flm , however , modelling @xmath8 and @xmath1 we see from figure ( [ figure5 ] ) that rather than following @xmath98 , the @xmath78 measured on the difference time series @xmath14 still grows as @xmath99 i.e. it does , as postulated in subsection 3.5 , measure @xmath50 rather than @xmath52 .",
    "this effect requires some discussion .",
    "it seems to be a further manifestation of the  pseudo - gaussian \" behaviour of truncated standard lvy motion @xcite , and known @xcite to be responsible for the result @xmath100 in that case ( see also figure 5 ) .",
    "our simulations have clearly demonstrated that it generalises to the long - range dependent flm case i.e. that in general for flm @xmath101 .",
    "this conclusion is most clearly supported by figure 5 where the @xmath102 value can be read off as following this relation over the range @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "the agreement is poorer at smaller @xmath25 values tested .",
    "we currently think this reflects known difficulties with accurately simulating strongly anticorrelated flm @xcite .",
    "the effect has previously been remarked on in the truncated standard lvy paradigm ; for example the s&p 500 financial time series , depicted by @xcite where @xmath27 ( their fig .",
    "11.4.a ) so @xmath78 grows as @xmath79 ( their fig .",
    "11.3a ) , in contrast to an @xmath2 value from peak scaling of @xmath105 ( their fig . 9.3 ) .    in the multifractal modelling community",
    "the power spectrum has long been seen as only just one of several ways of measuring @xmath102 .",
    "for this reason a difference in the value of @xmath106 has sometimes been claimed as direct evidence of the inapplicability of _ any _ additive model and thus the immediate need for a multiplicative model @xcite .",
    "conversely our result would seem to suggest that any truncated stable additive model other than the fbm / wbm limiting cases is likely to show @xmath106 , and @xmath101 without the need for a multiplicative model .",
    "this may be understood as being because truncated lvy motion , whether standard or fractional , behaves as a bifractal @xcite .",
    "there may be natural time series where additive flm is actually the most natural model , or at least an economical and easily specified one .      at this point",
    "it may be objected that we have not tested any predictions of the flm model against the behaviour of natural time series other than those properties used to specify it .",
    "our first additional check is thus to examine the multi - affine behaviour seen in the data and the model using the  @xmath107 plots \" defined in section 3.4 .",
    "such a plot , showing scaling exponent @xmath61 versus moment @xmath65 is shown for the data in figure ( [ figure8 ] ) .",
    "interestingly @xmath7 most resembles a  classic \" multifractal , in that the points @xmath61 lie on a curve rather than a straight or broken line @xcite .",
    "however @xmath0 , or at least @xmath8 , have @xmath107 which arguably flattens out near 1 for higher moments . @xmath1",
    "intriguingly even seems to _ fall _ as @xmath108 increases .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively similar to that seen for our simulated @xmath8 and @xmath1 time series , whose @xmath61 plots are superposed on the figure . in particular",
    "a change in the range of @xmath11 over which the simulated @xmath8 structure functions are taken to be power laws is enough to encompass the observed range of @xmath107 plots for @xmath1 .",
    "more detailed comparison is at present prevented by the difficulty of obtaining accurate values of @xmath60 for high moments - an issue also afflicting analysis of real data .",
    "a significant body of data and models now exists for the problem of solar wind and magnetic index scaling .",
    "we have here suggested a complementary approach , motivated in particular by the need to i ) reconcile differing estimates of scaling exponents ( in hindsight the joseph and hurst exponents @xmath50 and @xmath2 ) ; ii ) model subdiffusive behaviour ( @xmath109 ) ; and iii ) model long - ranged correlation ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "we proposed the use of a simple and economical model : fractional lvy motion , to describe the scaling of the above quantities .",
    "initial consistency checks with respect to the distribution of returns and the scaling of standard deviation support the use of flm , and the multi - affine  zeta plots \" are more qualitatively similar .",
    "importantly we find that the degree of similarity between model solar wind @xmath1 and the model @xmath8 index does indeed depend on the moment order at which comparison is made , but that this does not , however , require a multiplicative process to explain it .",
    "the difference can , rather , be understood as coming from the bifractality of a truncated fractional lvy motion .",
    "this explains why some measures such as @xmath2 from the distribution of returns or pdf rescaling are much closer to each other than , for example , the @xmath78-based exponent ( which we found to measure @xmath50 , not @xmath2 ) .",
    "the present paper has been mainly concerned with the modelling of measured quantities rather than the extent to which they are artificial . for geomagnetic indices and other constructed quantitities like @xmath1 ,",
    "however , the extent to which scaling behaviour could be an artefact of the construction method is an important issue .",
    "we are aware of some progress in studying this problem ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , more will be needed .",
