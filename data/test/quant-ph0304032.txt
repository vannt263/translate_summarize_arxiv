    "discrimination of non - commutative quantum states is one of the central issues in the field of quantum information processing .",
    "since quantum mechanics does not allow us to discriminate non - commutative states perfectly , several quantum measurement strategies have been studied for various figures of merits , such as average error probability @xcite , mutual information @xcite , and success probability of unambiguous state discrimination @xcite .",

    "this is the special case of neyman - pearson hypothesis testing @xcite , namely , a strategy to maximize the success probability ( to follow the conventional theory , we call it the ` detection probability ' ) while keeping the false - alarm probability equal to zero .    the neyman - pearson approach is effective for a decision problem where the prior probabilities of signals are unreliably known or unknown . its quantum version has recently been applied to quantum interferometric sensing @xcite .",
    "the problem of the quantum neyman - pearson approach is , however , that the analytical solution is only known for pure state signals @xcite .",

    "in the following two sections , we apply our measurement strategy to sensing applications .",
