    "in recent years , we witnessed rapid development in quantum gravity theories , especially in the string theory and the loop quantum gravity theory .",
    "both of them have produced many important results . for loop quantum gravity , area and volume operators",
    "have been quantized @xcite .",
    "the entropy of black holes @xcite can be calculated from statistical mechanics .",
    "in addition , as a successful application of loop quantum gravity to cosmology , loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) has an outstanding result  replacing the big bang spacetime singularity of cosmology with a big bounce @xcite .",
    "lqc also gives a quantum suppression of classical chaotic behavior near singularities in the bianchi - ix models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that non - perturbative modification of the matter hamiltonian leads to a generic phase of inflation @xcite .",
    "we also know that there are many alternative ways for quantum gravity , including the string theory and non - perturbative quantum gravity . within non - perturbative quantum gravity only , we have also many choices for quantization , with freedom in , for example , the choice of variables and the choice of the related groups .",
    "thus any contribution from experimental observation would be all the more valuable .    in cosmology ,",
    "the data accumulated are plenty , actually more than what theory can explain . among the observations ,",
    "the luminosity - redshift relation of type ia supernovae ( snia ) suggests that the universe has entered a phase of accelerating expansion and that the universe is spatially flat @xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting to see if we can use this observable to verify any quantum gravity schemes , or use a gedanken experiment to test the different behaviors of different schemes .",
    "this is the topic of this paper .",
    "based on the effective lqc theory , we look into the effect of quantum correction on the luminosity - redshift relation , and test the different choices involved in lqc , which have been causing ambiguity .",
    "classically , scalar field is used to explain dark matter / energy , and the scalar field model fits the experiment data well @xcite .",
    "therefore we use this model as the classical reference for investigating the quantum effects .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section , we give a brief review of effective lqc theory . in this paper",
    "we consider only the holonomy correction and the inverse volume correction . in sec.[sec.3 ] , we use a massless scalar field to model the dark matter / energy , and derive the classical luminosity - redshift relation of this model . for comparison with lqc",
    ", we adopt the formalism of effective lqc to express this classical dynamics . in secs.[sec.4 ] and [ sec.5 ] , we study the quantum effects , paying much attention to the @xmath0-parameter in the @xmath1 scheme .",
    "we conclude the paper in the last section . through out this paper we adopt @xmath2 which results in the hubble constant @xmath3 .",
    "based on the assumptions of cosmological principle and that the universe is spatially flat , the metric of the related spacetime is described by frw metric @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the scale factor of the universe , which only depends on @xmath6 due to homogeneity of our universe .",
    "the classical hamiltonian for the system we considered in this paper is given by @xmath7 here we have adopted the ashtekar variables in loop quantum gravity .",
    "the phase space is spanned by the generalized coordinates @xmath8 and the generalized momentum @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the barbero - immirzi parameter .",
    "@xmath11 denotes the hamiltonian of the matter part and @xmath12 denotes the matter field .",
    "together with the poisson bracket for the gravity part , which is defined for any two functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 on phase space as @xmath15 we can get the corresponding canonical equations .",
    "correspondingly , the effective hamiltonian in lqc is given by @xcite @xmath16 if we consider the inverse volume quantum correction , @xmath11 will change correspondingly .",
    "we will describe more in sec.[sec.5 ] .",
    "the variable @xmath1 corresponds to the dimensionless length of the edge of the elementary loop and is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a constant and depends on the particular scheme in the holonomy corrections .",
    "according to the idea of area quantization and the requirement of area gap , we have @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the planck length .",
    "@xmath0 is an ambiguous parameter in lqc .",
    "considerations of the lattice states place an restriction that @xmath21 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the anomaly cancellation and the positivity of the graviton s effective mass requires @xmath22 $ ] @xcite .",
    "but we are still not able to fix this ambiguity parameter theoretically .",
    "later in this paper we will test the influence of different values of @xmath0 on the luminosity - redshift relation .",
    "in this section we will investigate the classical dynamics of the universe using scalar field to model the dark matter / energy .",
    "the universe is nearly homogeneous and isotropic , with roughly @xmath23 of the matter content being ordinary matter , @xmath24 being cold dark matter and @xmath25 being dark energy . until now",
    ", we do not know the nature of the cold dark matter and the dark energy , here we use a massless scalar field to model the cold dark matter and the dark energy , and ignore the ordinary matter part .",
    "the hamiltonian of the classical scalar field model is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the conjugate momentum of the free massless scalar field @xmath12 .",
    "following @xcite we take @xmath28 where @xmath29 is some constant .",
    "the equations of motion in this classical case are given by hamilton s equations : @xmath30    the friedmann equation reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "the exact solution to the model described above is @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "and the parameter of the state equation is @xmath35 .",
    "we will see in the following that @xmath36 is a negative constant , to be consistent with the property of cold dark matter and dark energy , for which the equation of state parameters are 0 and -1 respectively .",
    "the luminosity distance is a way of expressing the amount of light received from a distant object .",
    "when we receive a certain flux from an object , we can calculate the luminosity distance between us and the object , assuming the inverse square law for the reduction of light intensity with distance holds .",
    "because of the expansion of the universe , the number of photons in unit volume of a sphere shell will decrease @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the redshift factor . considering the cosmological redshift effect , the individual photons will lose energy @xmath39 .",
    "based on the above inverse square law assumption , we get luminosity distance @xmath40 given the above exact solution , we have @xmath41 . \\label{eq13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to the astronomical convention , we adopt the logarithmic measure of the luminosity instead of luminosity itself in presenting our result , @xmath42 here -286.4 comes from our units @xmath2 . which results in 25 .",
    "useing the planck units gives the result of -286.4 , since @xmath43m@xmath44mpc .",
    "] using eq.([eq13 ] ) in the above equation , we get @xmath45}\\right\\}. \\label{eq15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] fitting @xmath46 in this equation to the experimental data reported in @xcite , we get @xmath47 which results in the parameter of the state equation @xmath48 . for",
    "cold dark matter and dark energy the total pressure can be expressed as @xmath49 where subfix @xmath50 means the cold dark matter , and @xmath51 means dark energy . in the above equation , we have used @xmath52 and @xmath53 . thus our fitted result @xmath48 is consistent with roughly @xmath25 of our universe being dark energy . as fig.[fig1 ] shows , the resulted line lies closely with the experimental data .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "there are currently different proposals for a theory of quantum gravity , including the string theory and the loop quantum gravity theory , among others .",
    "they all pass the check of self - consistency . even in the loop quantum gravity theory alone , there are many ambiguities that we do not know the way to eliminate . to a large extent",
    ", this situation results from the lack of association with experimental data . on the other hand ,",
    "there are plenty of experiment data in cosmology awaiting satisfactory explanation .",
    "for example , we have yet to have a consistent theory to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe at the present age .    in this paper",
    "we use the luminosity - redshift relation to test lqg effects .",
    "we find this relation to be capable of revealing the quantum effects and fixing the quantum parameters .",
    "lqc predicts a multi - valued luminosity - redshift relation , as a result of the quantum bounce behavior .",
    "the exact shape of the relation can be used to fix quantum parameters in lqc .",
    "we can also distinguish the inverse volume quantum correction from the classical picture .",
    "although some of the predictions made in this paper can not yet be tested using the experiment data available , it is a good gedanken experiment at least , to study the ambiguities involved in lqc and how they can be eliminated .",
    "certainly , this paper touches merely a small part of the problem with ambiguity in lqc , yet our results show that the quantum bounce behavior is possibly observable through the multi - valued shape of luminosity - redshift relation .",
