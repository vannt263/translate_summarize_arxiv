    "ever since the realization of the atom optics quantum kicked rotor ( aoqkr ) @xcite , it has been one of the workhorses for studies of experimental quantum chaos .",
    "it has revealed a wide variety of interesting effects including : dynamical localization @xcite , quantum resonances ( qr ) @xcite , quantum accelerator modes @xcite , and quantum ratchets @xcite .",
    "the latter are quantum mechanical systems that display directed motion of particles in the absence of unbalanced forces .",
    "they are of considerable interest because classical ratchets are the underlying mechanism for some biological motors and nanoscale devices @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies have demonstrated that a controllable directed current arises in kicked atom systems at qr .",
    "a qr occurs when the kicking period is commensurate with the natural periods of the rotor and is characterized by a quadratic growth of the kinetic energy with time .",
    "the question of what happens to a ratchet away from resonance was addressed in a recent theoretical paper @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the authors developed a classical - like ratchet theory and proposed the existence of a one - parameter scaling law that could be used to predict the ratchet current for a wide variety of parameters .",
    "it was also shown that an _ inversion _ of the momentum current is possible for some sets of scaling variables .    in this paper , we report the experimental observation of such a ratchet current inversion and the verification of the scaling law for a wide variety of experimental parameters .",
    "our experiments were carried out by exposing a bose - einsten condensate ( bec ) to a series of standing wave laser pulses that provided an optical potential periodic in space and time .",
    "figure [ rawplot ] shows raw momentum distributions as a function of the pulse period s offset from the first qr and the kick number ( fig .",
    "[ rawplot ] ( a ) and ( b ) respectively ) .",
    "it can be seen that there are certain values of time offset and kick number where the distribution is weighted more strongly towards negative momentum .",
    "this is evidence of a current reversal .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ rawplot ] ( a ) and ( b ) contain other similarities .",
    "for example , there are parameter regimes where the    s ) ( 10 kicks , @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , and ( b ) kick number ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 . ) .",
    "each momentum distribution was captured in a separate time - of - flight experiment .",
    "note that there are features common to both panels , such as a weighting of the distributions towards positive momenta at small values of the independent variable followed by a tendency towards negative momenta at larger values of this parameter .",
    "these features are a manifestation of the fact that the mean momentum or ratchet current can be described by a universal scaling law .",
    ", width=9,height=10 ]    momentum distributions tend strongly towards positive momenta , followed by the current reversal regions where the distributions tend negative .",
    "this suggests that it may be possible to use a single - parameter theory to understand the behavior of the system .",
    "moreover , since the time offset from qr effectively defines a new planck constant @xcite , we can easily switch from the classical to the quantum regime by a simple change of the pulse period @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the aoqkr system can be described by a hamiltonian which in dimensionless units is @xcite : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the momentum ( in units of @xmath6 , two photon recoils ) that an atom of mass @xmath7 acquires from short , periodic pulses of a standing wave with a grating vector @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the spatial period of the standing wave ) . since momentum in this system",
    "is only changed in quanta of @xmath6 , we break down @xmath10 as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are integer and fractional parts of the momentum respectively and @xmath13 , the quasi - momentum , is conserved .",
    "other variables are the position @xmath14 ( in units of @xmath15 ) , the continuous time variable @xmath16 ( integer units ) , and the kick number @xmath17 .",
    "the pulse period @xmath18 is scaled by @xmath19 ( the half - talbot time ) to give the scaled pulse period @xmath20 .",
    "the strength of the kicks is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the pulse length , @xmath23 is the rabi frequency , and @xmath24 is the detuning of the kicking laser from the atomic transition . to create a ratchet from this hamiltonian",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a superposition of two plane waves should be used for the initial state .",
    "a successful approach to treating this system close to resonant values of @xmath25 ( i.e. @xmath26 , with @xmath27 integer ) is the so called @xmath28classical theory . here",
    "the scaled pulse period is written as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , and can be shown to play the role of planck s constant . in this case",
    "the dynamics can be understood by the classical mapping @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the scaled kicking strength , @xmath33 is the scaled momentum variable and @xmath34/2 $ ] is the scaled position exploiting the spatial periodicity of the kick potential .",
    "as mentioned above , for the ratchet we start with a superposition of plane waves @xmath35 $ ] , or equivalently a rotor state @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "this leads to the position space probability distribution function @xmath37 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath38 is an additional phase used to account for the possibility that the initial spatial atomic distribution is shifted in position relative to the applied periodic potential .",
    "although the distribution @xmath39 is quantum in origin , in what follows it will be interpreted as a classical probability .     as a function of the scaling variable @xmath40 @xmath17 . in ( a )",
    "@xmath41 was varied by scanning over kick number for different combinations of @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath38 . in panel",
    "( b ) @xmath41 was varied by scanning over @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( green squares ) , and with @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( red circles ) . also plotted in ( b )",
    "is data from a scan over @xmath42 with @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( blue triangles ) . in both panels , the solid line is the function @xmath50 given by eq .",
    "( [ analytic ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates that no matter how @xmath41 is obtained the scaled mean momentum is approximately universal.,width=340,height=359 ]    the original application of @xmath28classical theory to the kicked rotor system showed the existence of a one - parameter scaling law for the mean energy @xcite .",
    "this was experimentally verified in the vicinity of the first and second quantum resonances ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) in ref .",
    "it was found that the scaled energy could be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 @xmath17 is a scaling variable and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are closed form functions of @xmath41 .",
    "recently , the existence of a one - parameter scaling law for the ratchet current using the same scaling parameter @xmath41 was proposed @xcite .",
    "one of the notable features of this theory is that it predicts that at some values of the scaling variable ( i.e. certain families of real parameters ) an inversion of momentum current can occur .    in the pendulum approximation @xcite ,",
    "the motion of the kicked rotor in continuous time is described by the scaled hamiltonian @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 is a scaled momentum variable . near the quantum resonance , using the position space probability distribution function @xmath39 , one can calculate @xmath59 . for @xmath60 , eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) gives a phase space dominated by a pendulum - like resonance island of extension @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "hence @xmath62 and @xmath63 essentially contribute in the same way giving @xmath64 so that the map in eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) is @xmath65 . with the scaling variable @xmath41 ,",
    "the average scaled momentum becomes @xmath66 , where    @xmath67    thus the mean momentum ( units of @xmath6 ) expressed in terms of the scaled variables is @xmath68 where @xmath69 can be computed from the above pendulum approximation @xcite .",
    "we performed our experiments using a similar set up to that described in @xcite .",
    "a bec of about 40000 @xmath70rb atoms was created in the @xmath71 , @xmath72 level using an all - optical trap technique .",
    "approximately 5 ms after being released from the trap , the condensate was exposed to a pulsed horizontal standing wave of wavelength @xmath73 .",
    "this was formed by two laser beams of wavelength @xmath74 780 nm , detuned @xmath75ghz to the red of the atomic transition .",
    "the direction of each beam was aligned at @xmath76 to the vertical to give @xmath77 . with these parameters the primary qr ( half - talbot time @xcite ) occurred at multiples of @xmath78 @xmath79s .",
    "each laser beam was passed through an acousto - optic modulator driven by an arbitrary waveform generator .",
    "this enabled control of the phase , intensity , and pulse length as well as the relative frequency between the kicking beams . adding two counterpropagating waves differing in frequency by @xmath80 results in a standing wave that moves with a velocity @xmath81 .",
    "the initial momentum or quasi - momentum @xmath13 of the bec relative to the standing wave is proportional to @xmath82 , so that by changing @xmath80 the value of @xmath13 could be systematically controlled .",
    "the kicking pulse length was fixed at 1.54 @xmath83s , so we varied the intensity rather than the pulse length to change the kicking strength @xmath42 .",
    "this was done by adjusting the amplitudes of the rf waveforms driving the kicking pulses , ensuring that the experiments were performed in the raman - nath regime ( the distance an atom travels during the pulse is much smaller than the period of the potential ) .",
    "the initial state for the experiment was prepared as a superposition of two momentum states @xmath84 and @xmath85 by applying a long ( @xmath86s ) and very weak standing wave pulse ( bragg pulse ) . by using a pulse of suitable strength ,",
    "an equal superposition of the two aforementioned atomic states was created ( @xmath87 pulse ) .",
    "the bragg pulse was immediately followed by the kicking pulses in which a relative phase of @xmath38 between the beams was applied .",
    "this phase was experimentally controlled by adjusting the phase difference between the rf waveforms driving the two aoms .",
    "finally the kicked atoms were absorption imaged after @xmath88 ms using a time - of - flight measurement technique to yield momentum distributions like those seen in fig .",
    "[ rawplot ] .",
    "we now discuss the experiments that were carried out to observe the ratchet effect away from * @xmath51 * resonance . in this case",
    "@xmath89 is needed to fulfill the resonance condition @xcite .",
    "the measurements involve the determination of the mean momentum of kicked becs for various combinations of the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath42 , @xmath90 and @xmath38 .",
    "the measured momentum was then scaled by @xmath91 and is plotted as a function of the scaling variable @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ scaleplot ] . in fig .",
    "[ scaleplot](a ) @xmath41 was changed by varying kick number , @xmath17 , while in fig .",
    "[ scaleplot](b ) different @xmath41 were obtained by scanning either @xmath43 ( red circles and green squares ) or @xmath42 ( blue triangles ) .",
    "the solid line in both panels is a plot of the function @xmath92 given by eq .",
    "( [ analytic ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that no matter how @xmath41 is varied , the experimental results are in good agreement with the theory for many different combinations of parameters . in addition , there is a regime over @xmath41 where an inversion of the ratchet current takes place , with a maximum inversion at @xmath93 .",
    "interestingly this reversal of the ratchet takes place without altering any of the centers of symmetry of the system .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite also predicts current inversions at higher values of @xmath41 , although these were not seen in the experiments presumably because of dephasing effects such as vibrations and spontaneous emission .",
    "even though the @xmath28classical theory assumes @xmath43 is small , the experimental results show that it remains valid for higher values of @xmath43 as well .",
    "in fact the window of valid @xmath43 depends on the kick number @xcite , being rather large for small @xmath94 .",
    "this is expected from a heisenberg / fourier argument @xcite .",
    "( red crosses ) , @xmath95 ( blue circles ) , @xmath96 ( green diamonds ) , @xmath97 ( black stars ) and @xmath98 ( purple squares ) .",
    "the blue solid line is the plot of @xmath99 for @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the dashed lines are the plot of eq .",
    "( [ analytic ] ) with corresponding @xmath43 and the red solid line is the plot of eq.(2 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    ", width=8,height=7 ]    we also investigated the sensitivity of the finite spread in initial quasi - momentum , @xmath104 to the momentum transfer .",
    "figure [ momepsilon ] shows the plot of momentum current as a function of kick number for different values of @xmath43 .",
    "the solid blue line is the plot of @xmath99 .",
    "the dashed lines are plots of eq .",
    "( [ analytic ] ) for the corresponding experimental parameters .",
    "the experimental results show that the farther one goes from resonance the sooner the momentum current turns towards negative values ( current reversal ) .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the theory except very close to resonance , where the red dashed curve fits poorly to the red crosses . for this data",
    ", we note that the suppression in momentum current is likely to be caused mainly by the effect of the initial spread of quasi - momentum .",
    "this phenomenon was also seen in ref .",
    "@xcite where the ratchet current for finite @xmath105 was shown to be @xmath106\\exp[-2(\\pi l \\delta\\beta s)^2]$ ] .",
    "this equation with @xmath107 ( independently estimated from time - of - flight measurements ) is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ momepsilon ] ( red solid line ) .",
    "it can be seen to agree well with experiment .",
    "thus for @xmath108 ( corresponding to an offset from resonance of 0.3 @xmath83s ) , @xmath104 plays an unimportant role in the dynamics of the ratchet .",
    "this is because at resonance the total phase the momentum states acquire must be an integer multiple of @xmath109 .",
    "any deviation from this condition significantly suppresses the momentum current at longer times .",
    "however the momentum state phases away from resonance are already pseudo - random , so the phase changes caused by @xmath104 have a negligible effect .",
    "we have performed experiments to observe an off - resonant atomic ratchet by exposing an initial atomic state which was a superposition of two momentum states to a series of standing wave pulses .",
    "we measured the mean momentum current as a function of a scaling variable @xmath41 , which contained important pulse parameters such as the offset of the kicking period from resonance , the kick number , and the kick strength .",
    "we showed that a scaled version of the mean momentum could be described solely by @xmath41 , a result postulated by a theory based on a classical treatment of the system @xcite .",
    "the experiment verified that for certain ranges of @xmath41 the momentum current exhibited an inversion .",
    "we also studied the effect of initial quasi - momentum width on the ratchet current away from resonance .",
    "this width has a large impact extremely close to resonance , but plays an unimportant role as we go only a little farther from resonance .",
    "ultimately one can now control the strength and direction of the ratchet without changing the underlying relative symmetry between the initial state and the potential .",
    "this has practical advantages , since it is very easy to control the kicking strength , period , or kick number and hence influence the scaling parameter @xmath41 .",
    "another interesting possibility is the investigation of the performance of @xmath28classical ratchet theory as @xmath43 becomes larger .",
    "this should allow the crossover from classical to quantum ratchet dynamics @xcite to be better understood .",
