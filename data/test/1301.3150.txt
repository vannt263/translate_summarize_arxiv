    "the study of collisional relaxation in stellar nuclei around massive black holes and the associated rates of capture has a long history .",
    "the pioneering work of @xcite established a quasi - steady - state solution for the stellar distribution , now known as a bahcall - wolf cusp , which has a density @xmath6 inside the radius of influence @xmath7 , defined roughly as the radius enclosing a mass in stars equal to the mass @xmath8 of the hole .",
    "their solution was obtained from the steady - state , one - dimensional fokker - planck equation describing two - body relaxation and energy exchange between stars in the ( newtonian ) gravitational field of the massive object , and is characterized by zero ( or very small ) flux of stars with respect to energy into the central hole .",
    "a more refined treatment requires the concept of a `` loss cone '' , the region of phase space corresponding to stars with sufficienly low angular momenta to be captured by the black hole : @xmath9 , where the capture boundary @xmath10 is determined either by tidal disruption or by direct capture , at some radius @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the latter paper also introduced the important distinction between empty- and full - loss - cone regimes , with the boundary between them defined as the energy at which the typical change of angular momentum in one radial period , @xmath12 , is equal to @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite derived the quasi - steady - state rate of consumption of stars as a function of energy and showed that the distribution function depends logarithmically on angular momentum near the loss cone .",
    "these authors , and subsequently @xcite , included capture from the loss cone via an energy - dependent sink term in the one - dimensional fokker - planck equation for @xmath14 .",
    "while the addition of such a term greatly increases the capture rate , it was found to have little effect on the form of the density profile at radii @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite solved two - dimensional fokker - planck equation in @xmath16 space and confirmed the results of the more approximate one - dimensional studies .",
    "these early studies were targeted toward massive black holes in globular clusters .",
    "the theory was subsequently applied to determine capture rates in galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "studies based on the fokker - planck equation were also verified by other methods such as monte - carlo models @xcite , gaseous models @xcite and direct @xmath5-body simulation @xcite .    relaxation times in galactic nuclei are much longer than in globular clusters , and in many cases much longer than galaxy lifetimes .",
    "partly as a consequence , galactic nuclei need not be spherically symmetric , and they may contain a substantial population of `` centrophilic '' orbits ( saucers , pyramids ) that dominate the capture rate , even in the absence of gravitational encounters @xcite . in the context of collisional loss - cone repopulation , by",
    "far the majority of studies have assumed spherical symmetry .",
    "this assumption is not crucial for @xmath5-body integrations ( except insofar as it can be difficult to construct nonspherical initial conditions ) , but it is an important ingredient of fokker - planck studies , because it ensures the conservation of angular momentum in the unperturbed motion . to date ,",
    "all fokker - planck treatments that allowed for non - sphericity @xcite have assumed axisymmetry and have further restricted the allowed form of @xmath17 by writing @xmath18 , with @xmath2 the component of angular momentum parallel to the symmetry axis .",
    "two integrals of motion are not sufficient to specify regular motion in the axisymmetric geometry however , and numerical integrations in axisymmetric potentials typically reveal a third integral , @xmath19 ( with some orbits chaotic ) . of course , the reason for the neglect of @xmath19 is the absence of knowledge about its functional form . for mildly flattened systems ,",
    "@xmath19 can be approximated by @xmath20 @xcite , and this approximation has been used as a basis for constructing steady - state models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the neglect of the third integral in the axisymmetric problem has several important consequences . instead of individual orbits populated by stars having the same values of their integrals of motion",
    ", one effectively considers ensembles of orbits composed of stars with different @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , by setting @xmath18 , the phase space density is forced to be uniform within this ensemble , which may lead to unphysical constraints on the possible evolution of the system .",
    "the diffusion coefficients must also be evaluated as if they did not depend on @xmath19 , or , more correctly , are averaged over all possible values of @xmath19 .",
    "finally , ignoring the third integral precludes the detailed study of regular orbits such as saucers , which might be expected to dominate the loss rate @xcite .",
    "however , sufficiently close to the black hole , the unperturbed motion is nearly keplerian , and standard `` planetary '' perturbation theory implies the existence of a third integral , which can sometimes even be expressed in terms of simple functions @xcite . in this approximation , the unperturbed stellar orbits are regular ( integrable ) and respect three independent integrals of the motion : @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the `` secular , '' i.e. averaged , hamiltonian .    given an analytic expression for the third integral in the vicinity of the black hole , fully three - dimensional fokker - planck studies become feasible , describing the time evolution of @xmath21 .",
    "for the present study , however , we choose to concentrate on evolution in the two - dimensional subspace @xmath22 with the gravitational potential , and the orbital energy @xmath0 , fixed .",
    "our justification for ignoring changes in @xmath0 is the same as in many previous studies of the loss - cone problem in galactic nuclei @xcite : energy relaxation time scales are typically very long in nuclei , too long for steady - state configurations like the bahcall - wolf cusp to be reached . instead",
    ", the dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath0 is inferred from the observed , radial density profile via eddington s formula .",
    "our goal is to generalize the well - known , one - dimensional solutions for @xmath23 in the spherical geometry to the two - dimensional case @xmath24 in the axisymmetric geometry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec_orbital_structure ]",
    "we use the averaging method to demonstrate the existence of a third integral of motion inside the supermassive black hole ( sbh ) sphere of influence and we use it to elucidate the behavior of orbits : the tube orbits that are generic to the axisymmetric geometry , and the saucer orbits that inhabit the low - angular - momentum parts of phase space .",
    "the fokker - planck equation is written down in  [ sec_fp_definition ] , and a scheme for calculating diffusion coefficients is presented in the case of three integrals of motion . following this general treatment ,",
    "we then restrict our attention to weakly flattened systems , which allows some simplification in the computations .",
    "we also concentrate on the case @xmath25 , which is both physically reasonable , and which results in analytic expressions for many of the diffusion coefficients .  [ sec_boundary_cond ] discusses the proper boundary conditions for the fokker - planck equation , and  [ sec_fp_solution ]",
    "is devoted to the solution of the two - dimensional equation and comparison with the one - dimensional ( spherical ) case .",
    "it turns out that the flux of stars into the sbh  is enhanced with respect to the spherical case , but by a modest factor : at most a factor of a few . in  [ sec_nbody ]",
    "we describe direct @xmath5-body simulations designed to test the predictions of the fokker - planck models ; sections  [ sec_chaos ] and [ sec_triaxiality ] briefly discuss the role of chaotic orbits beyond the sbh  influence sphere , and triaxiality of the stellar potential , respectively . finally , in  [ sec_estimates ]",

    "this is an expected result : in the axisymmetric case , the effective volume of the loss region increases by a factor @xmath320 , but the probability for any star inside this loss region having an angular momentum less than the capture threshold decreases by the same factor .",

    "it is easy to see that in this case , which can be called the `` full loss wedge regime '' , the rate of consumption is equivalent to the draining rate of the full loss cone ( [ eq_fdrain ] ) . in other words ,",

    "figure  [ fig_streamlines ] shows stream lines of flux and isocontours of @xmath17 in a quasi - stationary 2d solution for a rather exaggerated value of @xmath383 . even in this case , most of the stream lines end inside the saucer region , and that is definitely so for more realistic ( smaller ) values of @xmath228 .",
    "it is also clear that in the saucer region , @xmath17 depends mainly on @xmath75 and is almost independent of the second coordinate , which justifies the square - root profile of @xmath358 as in equation  ( [ eq_f_rz ] ) , but only in this region . in the tube region , for the greater part of the phase space ( @xmath384 ) , the solution is close to that of the spherical problem , that is , @xmath385 , with @xmath386 experiencing only small oscillations .",
    "we can build an approximate solution by joining the two asymptotic forms at @xmath123 .",
    "a better description for the saucer region accounts for the fact that the flux in the @xmath75 direction gradually decreases from @xmath208 at the capture boundary to zero at @xmath123 : @xmath387 @xmath388 is the minimum value of @xmath74 , corresponding to the fixed - point saucer orbit ( [ eq_fpo ] ) .",
    "the second , approximate equality in equation ( [ eq_fluxrz_corr ] ) is an empirical fit to the numerical 2d solution . using the asymptotic expressions ( [ eq_coef_asympt_sau ] ) , it is easy to show that for @xmath389 the flux has the form ( [ eq_fluxrz ] ) , with the numerical coefficient @xmath390 ( which is @xmath391 larger than the value used by @xcite ) .",
    "the solution in the saucer region is obtained by solving the differential equation ( [ eq_fluxrz_corr ] ) : @xmath392 which is a somewhat improved form of equation  ( [ eq_f_rz ] ) .",
    "the solution in the tube region outside @xmath123 is approximated by @xmath393 the coefficient of the logarithmic term gives the same flux in the @xmath78 direction as in the spherical problem , and @xmath394 .",
    "figure  [ fig_rprofile ] shows the two asymptotic expressions along with the actual numerical solution .",
    "we compute the isotropized value @xmath350 taking into account only the contribution from @xmath395 , which introduces a fractional error of at most @xmath123 : @xmath396    putting all this together and expressing the relation between @xmath208 and @xmath273 in terms of the coefficient @xmath340 ( [ eq_boundary_cond_axi ] ) , we obtain @xmath397 equation  ( [ eq_capt_rate_axi_approx ] ) can be compared with equation  ( [ eq_fluxmt ] ) of @xcite : both share the property of being independent of @xmath228 , replacing it with some effective capture boundary @xmath382 for the empty - loss - cone regime , although this effective value is different . by comparing ( [ eq_capt_rate_axi_approx ] ) with the spherical analog ( [ eq_capt_rate_spher ] ) , we see that in our approximation , @xmath398 .",
    "figure  [ fig_reff ] shows that equation  ( [ eq_capt_rate_axi_approx ] ) predicts well the flux in the numerical steady - state solutions ; a better approximation to the effective capture boundary and the capture rate is @xmath399",
    "overall , the capture rates in the axisymmetric geometry are higher than in the spherical case with the same boundary condition @xmath400 , but not by a large factor : in the full - loss - cone regime ( @xmath401 ) they are essentially the same , while in the empty - loss - cone regime the effective boundary @xmath382 is higher than @xmath228 , but since the flux depends on it only logarithmically , the difference is not likely to be more than a factor of a few .    of course , more relevant is a comparison that takes into account that @xmath239 in the spherical case may be different from @xmath340 for the same values of @xmath207 and @xmath228 , as noted near the end of the previous section . for the least bound stars which are in the full - loss - cone regime ( @xmath402 ) , @xmath325 and @xmath403 . in this case",
    ", the capture rate does not depend on the diffusion coefficient @xmath404 but only on the value of @xmath228 .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ eq_boundary_cond_axi ] ) states that the flux @xmath302 is proportional to the average , isotropized value @xmath405 , and @xmath261 cancels out .    in the opposite case @xmath406 ,",
    "the capture rate is limited by diffusion , and @xmath407 is no longer close to isotropic . if @xmath408 , @xmath340 is also @xmath409 , and the denominator in the expression for the capture rate ( [ eq_capt_rate_axi ] ) tends to some constant value which depends only on @xmath123 , but not on @xmath227 or @xmath228 ( provided that @xmath315 ) .",
    "it is largely irrelevant whether the boundary condition itself corresponds to the empty ( @xmath410 ) or full - loss - wedge regime . in other words , in this _ diffusion - limited regime _ ( both in spherical and axisymmetric cases ) the boundary conditions ( [ eq_boundary_cond_spher ] ) or ( [ eq_boundary_cond_axi ] ) determine @xmath258 for a given flux @xmath272 , which itself is set by the gradient of the overall steady - state profile of solution . by comparison , in the spherical case the denominator in the expression for the capture rate ( [ eq_capt_rate_spher ] ) also depends only weakly ( logarithmically ) on @xmath228 and is almost independent of @xmath239 .",
    "therefore , the difference in capture rates between the axisymmetric and spherical problems , which results from the difference between @xmath411 and @xmath412 , is at most a factor of few in the case @xmath406 .",
    "the fokker - planck formalism developed in the previous sections relied on the existence of three integrals of motion deep inside the sbh  influence region . apart from some special , fully integrable cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most axisymmetric potentials containing central point masses are characterized by chaotic motion in the low - angular - momentum parts of phase space beyond the influence radius .",
    "chaotic orbits still respect two integrals of the motion , @xmath207 and @xmath75 , but in the absence of a third integral , they can in principle fill the accessible region in the meridional plane , allowing them to be captured as long as @xmath413 .",
    "we estimate the capture rate from these orbits by the following argument , similar to an argument of @xcite .",
    "first we introduce the concept of draining of the loss region , arising from non - conservaton of angular momentum without any relaxation effects , then estimate the role of relaxation , and finally discuss the combined effects of draining and relaxation .",
    "assume that the chaotic orbits occupy a region in the @xmath214 plane with @xmath414 .",
    "the value of @xmath415 plays the same role as @xmath123 inside the radius of influence , and is comparable to it for the same degree of flattening .",
    "furthermore , we assume that every chaotic orbit with a given @xmath75 can attain values of @xmath416 $ ] with equal probability ( numerical tests verify that this is a reasonable assumption ) .",
    "recall that the number of stars with given @xmath417 , which may be identified with the probability of finding a star in a given interval of @xmath418 , is @xmath419 , with @xmath420 given by equation  ( [ eq_densityofstates ] ) .",
    "then the fraction of time such an orbit spends below the capture boundary is @xmath421 , and this is essentially the probability of being captured during one radial period ( assuming the full - loss - cone boundary condition , i.e. that the change in angular momentum during one period is much larger than the capture boundary , which is reasonable for chaotic orbits ) .",
    "next we evaluate the time - dependent rate of capture of stars from chaotic orbits . from the above argument",
    "it follows that we need to consider @xmath358 decaying exponentially at every value of @xmath75 from its initial value @xmath422 , but with a different rate : @xmath423 .\\ ] ] the total number of chaotic orbits with @xmath413 and their capture rate is then given by    @xmath424    where @xmath425 from here it is clear that if we identify @xmath422 with the initial value of the distribution function in the loss cone @xmath258 , then the capture rate is initially equal to the draining rate of a uniformly populated loss cone ( [ eq_fdrain ] ) . in particular , when @xmath426 , we recover the standard , full - loss - cone draining rate , regardless of the value of @xmath415 . on the other hand , the draining time does depend on @xmath415 , since the number of stars in the chaotic region to be drained is @xmath427 times larger than the number of stars in the loss cone , therefore the draining time is longer than the radial period by the same factor . at times much longer than the draining time , the capture rate declines as @xmath428 , not exponentially , since it is dominated by the draining of chaotic orbits with @xmath429 .",
    "there is a great deal of similarity between the capture rates from the loss wedge of the saucer region of phase space for regular orbits within the radius of influence , and the chaotic region outside it .",
    "the details of draining are somewhat different ( in particular , for the regular orbits the draining rate declines as @xmath430 , as noted by @xcite ) , but since the draining time for saucer orbits is usually much shorter than a hubble time , we ignore that distinction and adopt the same expressions for them as for chaotic orbits . in both cases ,",
    "the _ local _ boundary condition for the loss region corresponds to the full loss cone ( [ eq_boundary_cond_axi ] ) , at least for the case @xmath431 relevant for all but the most tightly bound orbits .",
    "however , the _ global _ shape of the steady - state solution depends on whether the overall flux into the low angular momentum region is limited by diffusion ( @xmath432 ) or not . in the first case",
    ", the steady - state solution will still have a logarithmic form for @xmath433 or @xmath123 , corresponding to some effective capture boundary @xmath382 , and the capture rate depends on this effective boundary only logarithmically .",
    "in the latter case , the capture rate is essentially the full loss cone rate for an isotropic distribution function .",
    "the latter case , however , is rarely attained because @xmath237 rapidly drops with decreasing binding energy . on the other hand ,",
    "if the draining time for chaotic orbits is comparable to the hubble time , then their capture rate may still be quite high even in the absence of relaxation , provided that the initial value @xmath422 of the distribution function inside the chaotic region was not much different from the isotropic value @xmath350 .",
    "the combined effect of draining and relaxation may be approximately accounted for by the following recipe .",
    "let @xmath434 be the capture rate per unit energy from the fokker - planck equation with initial conditions corresponding to the loss region being initially empty ( i.e. the solution considered in   [ sec_fp_solution ] ) .",
    "since the loss region initially may have some nonzero value of @xmath17 , @xmath435 , the phase - space gradient of @xmath17 near the loss region boundary will be less than arising in the fokker - planck solution , and the capture rate from relaxation alone may also be lower .",
    "we approximate the total capture rate by the sum of the draining rate @xmath436 and the collisional flux @xmath437 multiplied by @xmath438 , where @xmath439 is the number of chaotic orbits at @xmath440 with @xmath426 .",
    "this expression is used to compare fokker - planck models against @xmath5-body simulations in  [ sec_nbody ] and to compute the capture rates for real galaxies in  [ sec_estimates ] .",
    "it is important to note that the effective capture boundary @xmath382 defined in ( [ eq_reff_axi ] ) , as the parameter controlling the overall shape of the steady - state solution and the gradient of the distribution function ( and hence the capture rate due to diffusion ) , is not the same as the size of the loss region ( @xmath441 for saucer orbits , @xmath442 for chaotic orbits ) which determines the draining time .",
    "the former , being a fixed fraction of @xmath123 ( @xmath415 ) , is usually much larger than the latter .",
    "these results will be used in  [ sec_nbody ] when we compare the model predictions with the results of @xmath5-body simulations .",
    "for completeness , and to put our results in a broader context , we briefly discuss the case when the stellar cusp around the sbh  is triaxial .",
    "triaxial potentials support two distinct familes of tube orbits , circulating about the long and short axes of the triaxial figure @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a new class of centrophilic regular orbits , the pyramids ( * ? ? ? * figure 11 ) .",
    "the defining feature of pyramids is that @xmath443 for all of them , and a star on such an orbit will eventually find its way into the sbh  even without the assistance of collisional relaxation .",
    "the fraction of phase space occupied by pyramids is comparable to that of saucer orbits , i.e. @xmath313 . outside the radius of influence , the regular pyramid orbits are mostly replaced by chaotic orbits , which are however still centrophilic @xcite .",
    ".comparison of three geometries[tab_geoms ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     we scale the velocity unit of the dehnen model by identifying the line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath444 , at the influence radius with the quantity @xmath334 in equation  ( [ eq_mbhsigma ] ) ; this is reasonable given that @xmath445 is a weak function of projected radius @xmath446 for @xmath447 , with @xmath448 the half - light radius .",
    "( in the case @xmath87 the central @xmath445 in the model lacking a sbhwas used . )",

    "the latter quantity is @xmath454 for a schwarzschild ( nonrotating ) sbh  @xcite ; this is the radius of periapsis of a keplerian orbit having the critical angular momentum .",
    "a star is tidally disrupted if the periapsis radius is less than @xmath455 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 6.3 ) .",
    "here @xmath456 depends on the stellar equation of state and is @xmath457 for a solar - type main - sequence star .",

    "@xmath458 we find that solar - type stars on eccentric orbits are disrupted ( not swallowed ) if @xmath459 ; disruption can occur for any @xmath460 if the star is on a less eccentric orbit , or for kerr sbhs  even more massive than @xmath461 @xcite .",
    "red giants or agb stars can also be disrupted ( or at least tidally limited ) by sbhs  more massive than @xmath461 @xcite . in what follows , we compute the total number of events associated with a given @xmath11 ; the ratio of number of tidal disruption flares to the total number of capture events is well studied in the literature and we do not consider it separately here .",
    "we used fokker - planck models to evaluate steady - state and time - dependent capture rates @xmath462 for galaxies after @xmath463 years starting from an initially isotropic distribution function , in both the spherical and axisymmetric geometries ( using our one - dimensional approximation of section  [ sec_fp_solution ] ) , for @xmath464 .",
    "the latter value is meant to represent a `` typical , '' moderately - flattened system ; the results do not strongly depend on @xmath123 . in the time - dependent calculations , the initial conditions consisted of the isotropic models with loss - cone orbits removed ; as a result , these initial models are characterized by strong gradients of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath41 near the loss cone .",
    "overall , the calculation of total capture rate is done in the same way as in the previous section .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig_rates ] shows results for two series of models : models with a steep ( @xmath465 ) central cusp and @xmath466 ; and models with shallow ( @xmath467 ) cores and @xmath468 . over the entire range of @xmath32 ,",
    "the steady - state capture rates differ by only a factor of @xmath469 between spherical and axisymmetric geometries , consistent with the discussion near the end of  [ sec_fp_solution ] .",
    "this result holds for any galactic model and depends only weakly on @xmath123 .",
    "the time - dependent rates are generally higher than in the steady state , due to the strong gradients in the initial conditions . especially for massive galaxies with long relaxation times ,",
    "the approach to a steady state is slow and the flux at early stages is much higher than in equilibrium .    for the most massive sbhs  ( @xmath470 ) the draining time of the loss region becomes comparable to the hubble time and the capture rate is dominated by draining of chaotic orbits ( double - dashed line ) , reaching values up to @xmath471 yr@xmath472 at the upper end of the @xmath32 range .",
    "however , this should be regarded as a strong upper limit since we do not know the initial state : for instance , if the sbh  formed as the result of a merger of a binary sbh , it is very likely that the low angular momentum region of phase space will have been depleted in the course of the binary s evolution , and the capture rates could initially be much _ lower _ than the steady - state values @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath462 on @xmath32 for massive sbhscan be simply estimated as follows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the nuclei of massive galaxies are in the empty - loss - cone regime , so the flux per unit energy is roughly @xmath473 $ ] .",
    "the capture rate peaks at @xmath474 @xcite so the total flux is estimated as @xmath475 . assuming the @xmath476 relation , we obtain @xmath477 , and even the normalization constant evaluates to a reasonable @xmath478 yr@xmath472 for @xmath479 , despite the crudeness of the estimate .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig_rates ] shows the uncertainties in the capture rate associated with the parameters @xmath239 and @xmath480 in the @xmath476 relation ( [ eq_mbhsigma ] ) and the slope of the density cusp @xmath481 .",
    "plotted are stationary capture rates for the spherical case ; other values scale roughly in the same proportion .",
    "the capture rates evaluated for a selection of individual galaxies from several previous studies are also plotted for comparison .",
    "it is clear that the scatter in the derived values is fairly large , about two orders of magnitude , although a general trend of decreasing rate with increasing @xmath32 is clear . comparing the inverted triangles in figure  [ fig_rates]b with the double - dashed curve in figure  [ fig_rates]a",
    ", we see that our estimates for the capture rate due to draining of chaotic orbits are substantially higher than those of @xcite .",
    "as argued above , this is most likely an overestimate resulting from simplistic initial conditions .",
    "it is also due partly to our selection of a different relation between the capture rate and the isotropized distribution function ; had we used their equation ( [ eq_fluxmt ] ) instead of our equation ( [ eq_capt_rate_axi_approx ] ) , the steady - state flux in the axisymmetric case would be factor of a few lower , although it should not affect the draining rate of centrophilic orbits which starts to dominate the capture rate at @xmath470 .",
    "overall , it is fair to say that our estimates predict capture rates in the range @xmath482 yr@xmath472 for less massive galaxies , and a few@xmath483 yr@xmath472 for giant galaxies with sbh   masses in excess of @xmath461 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the observationally derived estimates of rates of tidal disruption flares @xcite .",
    "( axisymmetric ) nuclear flattening may increase these numbers by a factor of few , and triaxiality may have a more dramatic effect on the consumption rate of the most massive sbhs   provided there are enough stars on centrophilic orbits .",
    "one potentially important feature of axisymmetric ( and triaxial ) systems is that most stars are consumed in the full - loss - cone regime of boundary conditions ( in spite of the fact that the angular momentum need not be isotropic ) .",
    "this means that stars approach the sbh  with a wide distribution in periapsis radii , as opposed to `` barely touching '' the disruption sphere in the empty - loss - cone regime . as a consequence",
    ", many stars will be strongly tidally distorted before disruption , which may result in a distinct observational signature @xcite , although more recent studies show that the difference may not be so pronounced @xcite .",
    "we have considered collisional ( gravitational - encounter - drive ) relaxation processes near supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) in spherical and axisymmetric models of galactic nuclei .",
    "we derived a fokker - planck formalism and compared its predictions with direct @xmath5-body simulations of capture .",
    "inside the sbh  radius of influence , the unperturbed motion of stars is regular , admitting three integrals of motion ( energy , @xmath1-component of the angular momentum @xmath2 , and secular hamiltonian @xmath74 ) .",
    "there are two families of orbits , tubes and saucers ; the latter exhibit large angular momentum variations and stars on saucer orbits approach much more closely to the sbh  than would be expected based on their average angular momentum .",
    "regularity of the motion allowed us to write down the orbit - averaged fokker - planck equation and to calculate the diffusion coefficients based on the standard formalism .",
    "we discussed the appropriate boundary conditions for capture by the sbh , and numerically solved the two - dimensional ( @xmath484 ) fokker - planck equation .",
    "we showed that its solution can be well approximated by an equivalent one - dimensional solution for diffusion in angular momentum , given appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "an important difference with the spherical case is that the boundary condition at the loss region typically corresponds to the full - loss - cone regime , in the sense that a change in angular momentum per one orbital period is larger than the size of the loss cone .",
    "nevertheless , the global shape of the solution , and , consequently , the capture rate of stars , is determined by the diffusion coefficient ( inversely proportional to the relaxation time ) , and depends only weakly on the effective size of the loss region .",
    "this treatment was not entirely self - consistent , as it did not account for resonant relaxation or for the breakdown of the orbit - averaged approximation near or beyond the radius of influence , but it nevertheless suggests a conclusion which turns out to be robust : compared with the spherical case having the same _ real _ ( not _ effective _ ) capture boundary , the flux into the loss cone is higher in the axisymmetric case , but not by a large factor , and only in the regime where the loss cone would be empty in the spherical system . in the axisymmetric case ,",
    "most of the stars find their way into the sbh  while on saucer orbits .",
    "we also carried out a number of @xmath5-body integrations which were found to agree remarkably well with the corresponding fokker - planck models .",
    "the agreement was not limited to the number of captured stars ; other quantities like the distribution of energy of the captured stars , the loss cone population , the diffusion coefficients , and the change in angular momentum during one radial period prior to capture were also found to be well reproduced .",
    "we note , however , that the angular momentum diffusion is larger in @xmath5-body models for stars with high binding energies ( close to the sbh ) , which may be an indication of resonant relaxation not accounted for in the fokker - planck models ; nevertheless , its influence on the capture rate is likely to be small .",
    "we applied our fokker - planck formalism to realistic galaxies with sbh  masses @xmath485 .",
    "we found that stationary capture rates are in the range @xmath486 yr@xmath472 in spherical galaxies and a factor @xmath469 higher in flattened systems , with an overall trend of decreasing event rate with increasing @xmath32 .",
    "time - dependent solutions were found to give generally higher estimated capture rates ; however , that result is likely to depend strongly on the assumed initial conditions @xcite .",
    "in particular , for massive ( @xmath470 ) sbhs  in axisymmetric nuclei , the draining time of chaotic orbits just outside the radius of influence can be comparable to the hubble time ; if such orbits were not depleted by ( for instance ) the binary sbh  that preceded the single sbh , capture rates might reach @xmath471yr@xmath472 .",
    "such high rates may be more relevant to triaxial galaxies in which the number of centrophilic orbits is likely to be large enough to maintain a full - loss - cone capture rate for a hubble time .",
