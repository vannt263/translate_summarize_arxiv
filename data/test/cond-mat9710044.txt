    "percolation theory is used to describe a variety of natural physical processes , which have been discussed in detail by stauffer and aharony @xcite and sahimi @xcite . in two - dimensional percolation , either exact values or precise estimates are known for the critical thresholds and other related coefficients and exponents @xcite .    however , three - dimensional lattices are relevant for most natural processes .",
    "the most common of these are the simple cubic ( s.c . ) , the face - centered cubic ( f.c.c . ) , and the body - centered cubic ( b.c.c . ) lattices .",
    "the percolation thresholds for these lattices are not known exactly , and the estimates that have been determined for the latter two lattices are much less precise than the values that have been found for typical two - dimensional systems .",
    "an exception is the case of the s.c .",
    "lattice , where fairly precise values have been determined .",
    "a number of years ago , ziff and stell carried out a study of three - dimensional percolation for the site and bond percolation on the s.c .",
    "lattice @xcite .",
    "the values @xmath13 and @xmath14 were found for bond and site percolation , respectively .",
    "the behavior for @xmath4 away from @xmath5 was also studied , and it was found that the critical exponents can be described by the consistent set @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , with errors @xmath18 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively . however , this work , which used a growth method essentially equivalent to the epidemic approach , remained unpublished as an internal report only @xcite .    in a more recent work , grassberger found @xmath20 and @xmath21 for bond and site percolation ( respectively ) on the s.c lattice @xcite , using an epidemic analysis @xcite .",
    "the precise agreement between these two independent works provides stong evidence that the procedures , random - number generators , error analyses , etc . , implemented by both of these groups of authors",
    "are correct .",
    "previous to these two works , @xmath5 was known only to about four significant figures , as discussed below .",
    "it is important to know @xmath5 very precisely so that other critical properties can be studied without bias .    for bond percolation on the f.c.c .  and b.c.c .",
    "lattices , the most accurate values appear to be @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , recently found by van der marck @xcite using the average crossing probability method @xcite .",
    "additional literature values are listed below . these thresholds are not precise enough for a study we have been carrying out on the universal excess cluster numbers in 3-d systems @xcite , and as a consequence we have conducted the present work .",
    "here , we use a growth or epidemic analysis to obtain new , high - precision values for the percolation thresholds of the s.c .",

    ".  lattices .",
    "we reaffirm that three - dimensional percolation follows the hypothesized finite - size and scaling behavior , and estimate the exponents and coefficients that enter into the finite - size and scaling functions .    in the following sections , we discuss the simulation that we used to grow the percolation clusters and obtain our data .",
    "then , we present and briefly discuss the results that we obtained from our simulations .",
    "we used a monte - carlo simulation of bond percolation on each of the three - dimensional lattices .",
    "this simulation employed the so - called leath growth algorithm @xcite to generate individual percolation clusters .",
    "the cluster was started at a seeded site that was centrally located on the lattice .",
    "from this site , a cluster was grown to neighboring sites by occupying the connecting bonds with a certain probability @xmath4 or leaving them unoccupied with a probability @xmath24 .",
    "the unit vectors that were used to locate the neighboring sites for each lattice are summarized in table i.   each of these clusters were allowed to grow until they reached an upper cut - off , at which point any cluster that was still growing was halted .",
    "this cut - off was @xmath25 ( 2,097,152 ) wetted sites for the s.c .",
    "lattice and @xmath26 ( 1,048,576 ) wetted sites for the f.c.c .  and b.c.c",
    ".  lattices .",
    "the size of the cluster was characterized by the number of wetted sites rather than the occupied bonds of the clusters , since the former figures directly in the growth algorithm procedure .    in order to grow such large clusters ,",
    "our simulation used the data - blocking scheme @xcite , in which large lattice is divided into smaller blocks and memory is assigned to a block only after the cluster has grown into it . in this case , the lattice , which has dimensions of @xmath27 , was divided into @xmath28 blocks of dimensions of size @xmath29 .",
    "bit mapping was also used to reduce the memory load of the large lattices .",
    "the upper six bits of each coordinate were used to tell where in the memory that block is mapped .",
    "the lower five bits of the @xmath30- and @xmath31-coordinates tell the memory which word and the lower five bits of the @xmath32-coordinate tell the memory which bit of that word is used to store the site .",
    "with such a large lattice and the cut - offs we used , none of the clusters saw the lattice boundary , so there were no boundary effects .",
    "the simulation counted the number of clusters that closed in a range of @xmath33 sites for @xmath34 , and recorded this number in the @xmath35th bin .",
    "if a cluster was still growing when it reached the upper cut - off , it was counted in the last ( 20th or 21st ) bin .",
    "the simulation also kept track of the average number of occupied bonds and the average number of unoccupied bonds for clusters in each bin range , for reasons discussed below .",
    "random numbers were generated by the four - tap shift - register rule @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the exclusive - or operation , which we have used ( with apparent success ) in numerous previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "using the data obtained from the simulation , the number of clusters grown to a size greater than or equal to size @xmath38 can be deduced .",
    "the probability of growing clusters with the number of wetted sites @xmath39 , @xmath40 , when operating at the critical threshold ( @xmath41 ) and neglecting finite - size effects , is predicted to follow @xcite : @xmath42 in fig .  1 , data from our simulation plotted on a log - log plot shows good agreement with this equation .",
    "however , for small clusters , there is a clear nonlinear region , which represents the finite - size effect . for large @xmath38 ,",
    "the curves also become nonlinear , resulting from growing the clusters at values of @xmath4 away from @xmath5 .",
    "values of @xmath4 that are greater than @xmath5 produce curves that increase for large @xmath38 , and values of @xmath4 below @xmath5 cause curves to decrease .",
    "such behavior is similar to that seen in an epidemic analysis of a transition of interacting particle systems , and indeed , the cluster growth procedure is in fact essentially such a process .",
    "the only difference is that , in the usual epidemic analysis @xcite , one plots the growth probability as a function of the time ( generation or chemical distance number for percolation ) , while here we plot that probability as a function of the size .",
    "but since the size scales with time , the two approaches are equivalent .",
    "the slope of the linear portion of the curves shown in fig .  1 is equal to ( @xmath43 ) , where @xmath6 is the fisher exponent @xcite .",
    "however , due to the nonlinear portions of the curves and the uncertainty of which @xmath4 is precisely at the critical threshold , it is difficult to accurately deduce @xmath6 from these plots . to make the behavior more pronounced , we plot difference between the data and a straight line of slope @xmath43 in fig .  2 , for the f.c.c",

    ", the correct value of @xmath6 produces a horizontal central portion of the curve . applying this analysis for all three lattices yields @xmath44 .",

    ", the finite - size correction must be added to ( [ eq1 ] ) . then @xmath45 is predicted to follow @xmath46 where @xmath8 is the first correction - to - scaling exponent @xcite .",

    "lattices , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath8 which produced the best linear fit are summarized in table ii .",
    "the slope of the curves gives the value for the coefficient @xmath49 in ( [ eq2 ] ) and the intercept gives @xmath50 in ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the values we found are summarized in table iii .",
    "note that the last data point is shown on each of these plots , but they have been left out of linear fits because they represent clusters of only two sites , too small to be describe by just the first term of the finite - size corrections series .      in fig .  1",
    ", we show the effect that values of @xmath4 away from @xmath5 have on the data for large clusters . in order to account for the behavior when @xmath51 , a scaling function needs to be included in @xmath45 .",
    "the behavior is then represented by @xmath52 which is valid rigorously in the scaling limit as @xmath53 , @xmath54 , such that @xmath55 = constant @xcite . because @xmath4 is close to @xmath5 , we can expand @xmath56 in a taylor series : @xmath57 eqs .",

    "these plots show a steep decline , which is the finite - size effect , followed by a mostly linear region as predicted by ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the linear portions of the curve become more nearly horizontal as the chosen value of @xmath4 gets closer to @xmath5 .",
    "the value for the critical threshold can be deduced by interpolating from these plots .",

    "from ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , it follows that : @xmath63[eq5 ] which implies that the value of the critical threshold can be calculated from the @xmath32-intercept of this plot , as shown in fig .",
    "6 . figs .",
    "5(a ) and 6 yield consistent values of the critical threshold for the s.c .  lattice .",
    "the linearized scaling function , as shown in ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , can be studied efficiently by the following procedure . from ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , it follows that : @xmath64 eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) shows that we could determine @xmath65 and @xmath66 directly from a measurement of the derivative @xmath67 as a function of @xmath38 .    to develop a formula for this derivative , we consider the formal expression for the probability of growing a cluster containing @xmath35 occupied bonds and @xmath68 vacant ( perimeter ) bonds : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of distinct clusters configurations with @xmath35 occupied and @xmath68 vacant bonds . from ( [ eq7 ] ) , we can write the probability of growing a cluster of size greater than or equal to @xmath38 as @xmath71 where the sum is over all @xmath35 and @xmath68 such that the number of wetted sites is @xmath39 .    differentiating ( [ eq8 ] ) with respect to @xmath4 gives : @xmath72[eq9 ] which can be simplified to the final form : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the average number of occupied and unoccupied bonds , respectively , over all clusters of size @xmath76 . for a monte - carlo estimate of this derivative ,",
    "we simply use @xmath74 and @xmath75 averaged over the sample of clusters .",
    "the values for these averages were recorded by our simulations , and were then used with ( [ eq10 ] ) to calculate the derivative .",
    "7 shows a plot of the measured derivative ( [ eq10 ] ) vs.  @xmath38 for the f.c.c .  and",
    ".   lattices . from the slopes and intercepts , and using the values of @xmath50 and @xmath6 determined above , we can deduce @xmath10 and @xmath77 .",
    "for @xmath10 we find @xmath78 for both cases , which is consistent with @xcite , and the values of @xmath77 we find are given in table iii .",
    "another application of the derivative ( [ eq10 ] ) is that it can be used to produce new curves at values of @xmath4 near @xmath5 that resemble the curves seen in figs .",
    "5(a ) , 5(b ) , and 5(c ) , by virtue of a taylor expansion , @xmath79 where the last derivative is determined using ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "this ` shifting ' of the data is useful for correcting results taken close to , but not precisely at , @xmath5 , without carrying out a new set of time - consuming simulations .",
    "our results show excellent agreement with the expected relationship for the number of cluster of size greater than or equal to @xmath38 , which is shown in ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the only nonlinear portions of the curve on a log - log plot occur when @xmath38 is either small or large , which is where ( [ eq1 ] ) is not valid .",
    "these nonlinearities are caused by the finite - size effect ( small @xmath38 ) and the departure of @xmath4 from @xmath5 ( large @xmath38 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath6 was found by comparing curves that were similar to those shown in figs .  2 and 3 , finding the value that produced the most nearly horizontal curve .",
    "as can be seen in figs .  2 and 3 for the f.c.c .",

    "this value of @xmath6 also provides the best horizontal curves for the other two lattices , showing universality ( with error bars of @xmath81 ) .",
    "this value of @xmath6 is also consistent with the values given by stauffer and aharony ( 2.18 ) @xcite and nakanishi and stanley ( 2.19 ) @xcite .      in fig .  4",

    "it is expected that the exponent @xmath8 is a universal quantity while the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath49 are different for the three different lattices .",
    "these expectations were born out by our results showing the best fit of data for all three lattices occurred at approximately the same value of @xmath8 @xmath9 , as shown in table ii , but different values of the coefficients as given in table iii .",
    "our value for @xmath8 is significantly larger than the value reported by nakanishi and stanley ( @xmath82 ) @xcite .",
    "we believe this discrepancy is due to their using less precise values of the critical exponents , which leads to more inherent error in @xmath8 , and carrying out significantly fewer simulations , as were feasible at the time that that work was done .      in figs .",

    "this increased precision is the result of having conducted extensive simulations with an inherently efficient procedure ( the epidemic method @xcite ) along with programming techniques that allow one to simulate very large lattices @xcite .",
    "the results of this work allow other properties of three - dimensional percolation on these lattices to be studied equally precisely .",
