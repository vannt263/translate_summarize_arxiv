    "the study of the collective behavior of populations of interacting nonlinear oscillators has attracted the interest of physicists and mathematicians for many years since they can be used to modelize several chemical , biological and physical systems@xcite . among them",
    ", we should mention cardiac pacemakers cells@xcite , integrate and fire neurons@xcite and other systems made of excitable units@xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical papers that have appeared in the scientific literature deal with oscillators interacting through continuous - time couplings , allowing them to describe the system by means of coupled differential equations and apply most of the modern nonlinear dynamics techniques .",
    "more challenging from a theoretical point of view is to consider a pulse - coupling , or in other words , oscillators coupled through instantaneous interactions that take place in a very specific moment of its period .",
    "the richness of behavior of these pulse - coupled oscillatory systems includes synchronization phenomena@xcite , spatio - temporal pattern formation@xcite ( we could mention , for instance , traveling waves@xcite , chessboard structures@xcite , and periodic waves@xcite ) , rhythm anihilation@xcite , self - organized criticality@xcite , ...",
    "most of the work on pattern formation has been done in mean - field models or populations of just a few oscillators .",
    "however , such restrictions do not allow to consider the effect of certain variables whose effect can be crucial for realistic systems .",
    "the specific topology of the connections or geometry of the system are some typical examples which usually induce important changes in the collective behavior of these models .",
    "pattern formation usually takes place when oscillatory units interact in an inhibitory way , although it has also been shown that the shape of the interacting pulse , when the spike lasts for a certain amount of time , or time delays in the interactions can lead to spatio - temporal pattern formation also in the case of excitatory couplings@xcite . only recently ,",
    "general solutions for the general case , where the patterns existence and stability is proved , have been worked out@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study some pattern properties and get a quantitative estimation of the probability of pattern selection under arbitrary initial conditions or , in the language of dynamical systems , the volume of the basin of attraction of each pattern . keeping this goal in mind",
    ", we will use the general results given in @xcite where assuming a system defined on a ring the authors developed a mathematical formalism powerful enough to get analytic information of the system . not only about the mechanisms which are responsible for synchronization and formation of spatio - temporal structures , but also , as a complement , to proof under which conditions they are stable solutions of the dynamical equations .",
    "despite the apparent simplicity of the model , some ring lattices of pulse - coupled oscillators are currently used to modelize certain types of cardiac arhythmias where there is an abnormally rapid heartbeat whose period is set by the time that an excitation takes to travel the circuit @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are experiments where rings of a few r15 neurons from _ aplysia _ are constructed and stable patterns are reported @xcite .",
    "our 1d model allows us to study analytically the most simple patterns and understand their mechanisms of selection .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec",
    "ii we review the model introduced in @xcite as well as set the notation used throughout the paper .",
    "in section iii we study some pattern properties which will be useful for , in section iv , propose an estimation of the probability of selection of each pattern . in the last section we present our conclusions .",
    "our system consists in a ring of @xmath1 pulse - coupled oscillators .",
    "the phase of each oscillator @xmath2 evolves linearly in time    @xmath3    until one of them reaches the threshold value @xmath4 .",
    "when this happens the oscillator fires and changes the state of its rightmost neighbor according to    @xmath5 subjected to periodic boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath6 , and where @xmath7 denotes the strength of the coupling and @xmath8 . where we have assumed that , from an effective point of view , the pulse - interaction between oscillators , as well as the state of each unit of the system , can be described in terms of changes in the phase , or in other words , in terms of the so called phase response curve ( prc ) , @xmath9 in our case .",
    "a prc for a given oscillator represents the phase advance or delay as a result of receiving an external stimuli ( the pulse ) at different moments in the cycle of the oscillator .",
    "we will assume @xmath10 througout the paper , as we are only interested in spatio - temporal pattern formation and @xmath11 always leads to the globally synchronized state@xcite .",
    "this linear prc has physical sense in some situations .",
    "for instance , it shows up when we expand the non - linear prc for the peskin model of pacemaker cardiac cells @xcite in powers of the convexity of the driving or in neuronal modelling@xcite . in practice , however , this condition can be relaxed since a nonlinear prc does not change the qualitative behavior of the model provided the number of fixed points of the dynamics is not altered . moreover , a linear prc has the advantage of making the system tractable from an analytical point of view .",
    "let us describe the notation used in the paper .",
    "the population is ordered according to the following criterion : the oscillator which fires will be always labeled as unit 0 and the rest of the population will be ordered from this unit clockwise . after the firing , the system is driven until another oscillator reaches the threshold .",
    "then , we relabel the units such that the oscillator at @xmath12 is now unit number 0 , and so on .",
    "this firing + driving ( fd ) process for @xmath13 oscillators can be described through a suitable transformation    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is a @xmath16 matrix , @xmath17 is a vector with @xmath0 components , @xmath18 is a vector with all its components equal to one and @xmath19 stands for the index of the oscillator which will fire next .",
    "we call this kind of transformation a firing map , and we have to define as many firing maps as oscillators could fire , that is , index @xmath19 must run from @xmath20 ( @xmath21 fires ) to @xmath0 ( @xmath22 fires ) . for example , in the @xmath23 oscillators case we have that the firing map corresponding to the fd process where @xmath24 is the next oscillator which do fire ,    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     apart from brute force counting , degeneracy distribution @xmath25 can also be determined from the following relation    @xmath26    for @xmath27 .",
    "this recursion relation is closed by    @xmath28    which correspond to the firing sequences    @xmath29 respectively .    from the previous relations one can deduce by induction the symmetry of the distribution with respect to its extremes at @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "@xmath32    and    @xmath33    another interesting property is the period @xmath34 of each spatio - temporal pattern @xmath35 .",
    "since all oscillators are in a phase - locked state , they must oscillate with the same period .",
    "then , as the intrinsic period of each oscillator is one , and when any oscillator receives the delaying pulse from its neighbor it has a phase equal to @xmath36 , one can easily realize that the effective period is    @xmath37    therefore , the larger the value of @xmath35 , the longer the period of its associated pattern .",
    "it is important to notice that we have not fixed the value of such periods ( each pattern has its own which is different from the others ) , since there are some authors who fix all periods equal to some constant , and use it as a condition to find the structures@xcite .",
    "once we have characterized all spatio - temporal patterns , we proceed to find some general formula which give us some estimation of the probability of each pattern to be selected , or in other words , an estimation of the volume of its basin of attraction . in order to achieve this objective",
    ", we should understand the mechanism which lead to the selection of a certain spatio - temporal structure and how is it modified as the parameters of the model ( @xmath38 in our case ) change .",
    "there is an easy and straightforward way to get the essential features of this mechanism assuming that the probability of one oscillator to fire next is , basically , proportional to its phase ( that is , if it has a phase slightly below @xmath39 it has a higher probability to be the next firing oscillator , whereas if it has a smaller phase , it will rarely fire next ) .",
    "imagine the phases of all oscillators randomly distributed over the interval @xmath40 .",
    "then we let the system evolve till one of the oscillators reaches a phase @xmath41 and emits a pulse that is received by its rightmost neighbor which lows its phase by an amount @xmath42 .",
    "now we assume that all phases are again randomly distributed over @xmath40 except the one which received the pulse whose phase is distributed over @xmath43 .",
    "so , we get rid of memory effects ( we know the oscillator that has fired should , now , have a phase equal to zero ) and just keep in mind if each oscillator has received a pulse or has not .",
    "therefore , the point is that under this conditions , the probability that one oscillator which has still not received a pulse do fire is some constant and , on the other hand , for the ones which had , is this constant times the factor @xmath44 .",
    "then , we can characterize the probability of having some cycle just by recalling how many oscillators do fire having previously received a pulse during that cycle .",
    "basically , this probability is proportional to @xmath45 where @xmath46 stands for the number of oscillators which do fire having already received a pulse ( the product of all constant terms will be absorbed in a normalization factor ) .",
    "this approach , where we assume all firings as almost - independent events , can be viewed as a kind of mean - field approximation .",
    "then , as has been shown before , since cycles leading to the same pattern @xmath35 always exactly have @xmath35 oscillators that do fire having received the interacting pulse , we can give an estimation of the probability for pattern @xmath35 selection in the @xmath13 oscillators case    @xmath47    here @xmath48 is chosen",
    "so that summation of the probabilities over m gives 1    @xmath49    in the limit of small coupling strength @xmath50 , which is the more interesting case for the majority of physical and biological systems , one can assume that interaction plays almost no role when pattern selection takes place . that is , the fact that one oscillator has received the pulse from its neighbor does not low its probability to fire as the pulse does not modify appreciably its phase .",
    "then , we can consider that all cycles have approximately the same probability to be selected , @xmath51 , and only pattern degeneracy has to be considered to get a good estimation of @xmath52    @xmath53    the dominant pattern , that is , the one which has the larger probability to be selected coincides with the mean value of @xmath35 ( due to the symmetric behavior of @xmath25 ) .",
    "@xmath54    for an odd number of oscillators @xmath55 does not exist and we have a competition between the two closest patterns @xmath56 and @xmath57 . recall that the most probable patterns turn out to be the ones with `` shortest wavelengths '' , a fact that was already reported in simulations of these sort of systems@xcite . in figs . 2 and 3 we check this new approximation for the @xmath58 and @xmath59 case and realize that expected results are in good agreement with simulations data .",
    "there also is the interesting question of how does this probability distribution modifies when the number of oscillators increases . in fig .",
    "4 we show @xmath60 for different values of @xmath13",
    ". since there are more possible values of @xmath35 available , as we increase @xmath13 , @xmath61 diminishes .",
    "the distribution also gets narrower as we increase @xmath13 and this becomes clear when one studies the variance of @xmath60 .",
    "it can be found that    @xmath62    we could not prove this without an explicit expression for @xmath25 but we have checked it n up to @xmath63 .",
    "therefore    @xmath64    it turns out that for a large number of oscillators almost all initial conditions lead to a pattern whose @xmath35 approximately falls in the interval @xmath65 . in order to compare it for different number of oscillators we have to normalize @xmath35 dividing by @xmath13 . in that case",
    ", one observes that @xmath66 so that as we increase @xmath13 , the spread of @xmath61 diminishes getting the distribution sharpened .",
    "= 6.0 cm    = 6.0 cm    = 6.0 cm    as eq .",
    "( 14 ) does not take into account the disappearance of the different patterns @xmath35 at the different values of @xmath67 predicted by eq .",
    "( 9 ) , it can not give a good quantitative estimation of pattern selection for higher coupling values .",
    "nevertheless we can expand eq .",
    "( 14 ) to the leading order in @xmath38 . for small @xmath38 ,",
    "@xmath52 are approximated by @xmath68 in fig .",
    "5 we compare this approximation with simulated data .",
    "the slopes near @xmath69 do agree with eq .",
    "( 21 ) .",
    "= 6.0 cm    in our simulations we calculate the probability of each pattern to be selected just by counting how many realizations ( with @xmath70 and the rest of oscillators with random initial conditions ) lead to each pattern @xmath35 and divide over the total number of realizations .    = 6.0 cm    = 6.0 cm    = 6.0 cm    although we only have a good quantitative estimation of @xmath61 for small values of @xmath38 , eq . ( 15 ) catches the two basic mechanisms responsible of pattern selection . on the one hand ,",
    "it is clear that for higher values of the coupling strength @xmath71 , when one oscillator receives a pulse , it lows its phase to almost zero and , consequently , its firing probability also does .",
    "therefore pattern selection probability @xmath72 is strongly controlled by the number of oscillators which have to fire having already received a pulse , that is , the probabilistic factor @xmath73 . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath61 begin to decrease sooner when @xmath71 increases , the larger @xmath35 is . on the other hand , for small values of the coupling strength ,",
    "interaction plays almost no role and @xmath72 is dominated by the degeneracy factor @xmath25 .",
    "therefore @xmath72 for the different values of @xmath35 are basically ordered as @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 we show results from simulations of @xmath72 for different number of oscillators .",
    "in this paper we have studied some properties of the spatio - temporal patterns that appear in a ring of pulse - coupled oscillators with inhibitory interactions .",
    "we have focused our attention in estimating the probability of selecting a certain pattern under arbitrary initial conditions and have shown the two basic mechanisms responsible of that : the degeneracy distribution @xmath25 , for small values of @xmath38 , and @xmath35 , the number of oscillators that do fire having already received a pulse , for higher values of @xmath38 . according to this , the different probabilities of selecting pattern @xmath35",
    "start being distributed following the degeneracy distribution @xmath25 , and , as @xmath38 decreases , these probabilities diminish in a hierarchical way : the larger the value of @xmath35 , the sooner its selection probability is going to decrease , so that only patterns with smaller m will survive for higher values of @xmath38 . moreover , some of the structures disappear , at the different values of @xmath77 , during this process . we have found out an approximation formula for @xmath72 which takes into account all these mechanisms and gives us a quantitative estimation of the different selection probabilities for small @xmath38 .",
    "the estimation of the volume of the basin of attraction of each spatio - temporal pattern @xmath35 also gives us an idea of the stability of the different structures with respect to additive noise fluctuations ( for instance , we can add some random quantity @xmath78 to all phases after each firing event or a continuous - time @xmath79 in the driving ) .",
    "simulations of arrays of noisy pulse coupled oscillators showed that our most probable patterns were also the most stable@xcite .",
    "the present paper only concerns spatio - temporal pattern formation in a ring of oscillators , nevertheless , all results are trivially generalized to bidirectional couplings . although the question of what happens when dealing with higher dimension lattices remains opened , some simulations results in 2d @xcite showed that almost all realizations lead to a chessboard pattern in analogy with our results in the ring . that makes us believe",
    "we have caught the basic features of the problem in our 1d model .",
