    "physics in warped higher dimensional spacetimes may play an important role in nature , as illustrated by the rs1 model  @xcite . however , effective field theory calculations are particularly complicated in such contexts .",
    "when warp factors vary greatly in the extra dimension(s ) it becomes difficult to power - count the size of feynman diagrams . for examples of such calculations see refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we begin a program of honing `` holographic renormalization group '' ideas  @xcite , applied to the rs scenario in  @xcite , into a tool for simplifying and gaining insight into warped effective field theory . in particular we will apply this tool to understand the robustness of the goldberger - wise stabilization mechanism  @xcite within effective field theory , although the methods are clearly very general .",
    "we use the ads / cft conjecture to inspire the form of a concrete and explicit renormalization group procedure , but do not rely on any unproven aspects of the conjecture .",
    "the form our rg will take is as a flow of effective field theories in rs1-type geometries of varying radius , @xmath0 , theories with smaller @xmath0 having lower warped down effective energy cutoffs .",
    "two effective theories lying on the same flow are matched to describe the same physics at energies below the lower of the two associated cutoffs .",
    "in particular this means that matched theories with different radii have the same `` ir '' or `` visible '' brane positions , but different `` uv '' or `` hidden '' brane positions . the matching is accomplished by tuning the hidden brane localized lagrangian as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this 4d lagrangian depends on the values of bulk fields induced on the hidden brane .",
    "we will show that formally the flow of hidden brane lagrangians looks like a wilsonian rg flow of purely 4d effective field theories .",
    "a crucial feature of the associated 4d effective lagrangians is that they are local which greatly simplifies power - counting .",
    "we identify a conformal fixed point in the rg as the concrete realization of the ads / cft connection within our formalism .",
    "refs . @xcite",
    "have developed a related rg formalism focusing on renormalization of boundary divergences and properties of the holographic stress tensor .",
    "rg flows associated to branes in codimension two were studied in refs .",
    "while this paper was being completed , refs .",
    "@xcite appeared , which also discusses similar rg ideas .",
    "the utility of our rg formalism is this ; one can integrate the flow to take low - energy calculations in a highly warped compactification where they are difficult , to simpler calculations in a much smaller compactification ( smaller @xmath0 ) where the effect of warping is much less significant .",
    "of course this requires computing the effective couplings on the hidden brane in the new compactification , but this is facilitated by perturbing about the conformal fixed point and by working systematically in the small couplings of the theory .    in this paper",
    ", we deal only with classical and tree - level quantum effective field theory involving a bulk scalar field , deferring a treatment of full effective quantum field theory with varying spins .",
    "already at this level , many of the non - trivial features of the rg procedure come into play .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss free field theory and point out the basic rg structure and fixed point . in section iii , we apply our results to rederive in a simple way the goldberger - wise stabilization mechanism when the bulk scalar is identified with the one introduced by goldberger and wise .",
    "( since we do not make gravity dynamical , our analysis is necessarily restricted to neglect the backreaction of the scalar on the geometry , the same approximation made in the original analysis . ) in section iv , we generalize our rg procedure to include a large class of interactions , in the bulk and on branes .",
    "we then use this in section v to demonstrate the robustness of the goldberger - wise mechanism within classical effective field theory in a manner that lends itself to generalization to the quantum case . in section",
    "vi , we switch from the language of classical field theory to consider tree - level feynman diagrams , setting the stage for the case of quantum loops , and showing how one deals with general effective interactions . section vii contains some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a bulk 5d scalar field , @xmath1 , propagating on a fixed rs1 background with metric , @xmath2 the @xmath3 coordinate parametrizes the direction in a compact orbifolded space .",
    "this is a slice of ads space bounded by the hidden brane at @xmath4 and the visible brane at @xmath5 .",
    "we take @xmath6 .    in this section",
    "we begin by studying a simple action which is exactly quadratic in @xmath1 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 the brane actions are written in terms of the induced brane metrics , @xmath9 and the dimensionless @xmath10-derivative expansions ( the 4d dalembertian is @xmath11 for the metric defined in ( [ metric1 ] ) and ( [ gident ] ) ) . @xmath12 and similarly for @xmath13 .",
    "the subscript `` @xmath14 '' denotes that the brane terms are quadratic in fields , which we generalize later .",
    "we denote the dimensions explicitly in units of the warping constant , @xmath15 .",
    "note that 4d general covariance ensures that in the space of 4-momenta , @xmath16 , the operator @xmath17 .",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath18 in 4-momentum space this is @xmath19 strictly in the bulk , @xmath20 satisfies the @xmath21 independent differential equation @xmath22 with boundary conditions @xmath23 we now define an `` effective '' hidden brane whose location is a variable , @xmath24 .",
    "we seek a new set of `` effective couplings '' on this brane replacing @xmath25 on the original hidden brane , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the induced metric on the brane , which imply a new set of boundary conditions at @xmath28 , @xmath29 we require :    1 .",
    "the matching condition that @xmath30 which are solutions to the original equations of motion ( inluding boundary conditions ) , ( [ bulkeom ] ) , are also solutions to the effective equations of motion when confined to the effective domain @xmath31 .",
    "the boundary condition that @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "this is obviously consistent with the previous requirement .",
    "+    we interpret @xmath34 as a set of running couplings , @xmath35 , and associated 4d generally - covariant derivative operators , @xmath36 , just as in ( [ lambdadefn ] ) .",
    "we would like to find the `` renormalization group '' flow , @xmath37 , of this set .",
    "we proceed by taking the logarithmic derivative of the boundary condition ( [ bca ] ) , use the bulk equation of motion ( [ zhindpeom ] ) as @xmath38 to eliminate second @xmath3-derivatives of @xmath1 at @xmath28 , and ( [ bca ] ) again to eliminate any first @xmath3-derivatives of @xmath1 at @xmath28 , thereby obtaining + [ lambda2running ] _ 2 ( q^2a^2 , a ) = 4 _ 2 - + 2 - 2(qa)^2 . clearly , the @xmath28 dependence in the first variable of @xmath39 is entirely fixed by 4d general covariance .",
    "we will focus on the non - trivial dependence in the second variable , getting a set of @xmath40 functions , @xmath41 since @xmath16 varies freely , this represents a set of coupled differential equations for the @xmath42 .",
    "this flow has a set of fixed points . in the vicinity of such fixed points , the rg flow simplifies .",
    "when @xmath43 for all @xmath44 we solve the differential equation @xmath45 to find the fixed point @xmath46 this can be expanded in powers of @xmath47 and therefore corresponds to a local fixed - point effective brane lagrangian when written in position space .",
    "there is another solution , involving @xmath48 s , which is non - analytic in @xmath16 and therefore can not be interpreted as a local lagrangian on the effective brane .",
    "it is therefore rejected .    for small momentum ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50 .",
    "as @xmath51 ( [ closedfixpt ] ) tells us @xmath52 .",
    "the same result is also obvious from the @xmath40 function equation ( [ lambda2running ] ) by first setting @xmath51 .",
    "in fact one can solve ( [ lambda2running ] ) for the fixed point by working order by order in powers of @xmath53 .",
    "this will generate ( [ closedfixpt ] ) as a series in @xmath53 . at",
    "leading order ( [ lambda2running ] ) implies ( _ 2^*(0 ) ) ^2 - 4 _",
    "2^*(0 ) - 2=0 .",
    "taking the positive root to match ( [ closedfixpt ] ) as @xmath54 , we again find @xmath55 at higher order in @xmath53 we find @xmath56 .",
    "this method of working out the @xmath40 functions in powers of @xmath53 will be more useful when we add interactions and the coupled rg equations are not soluable in closed form .",
    "notice that nowhere did the matching procedure specifically require that the bulk metric be ads space .",
    "for example , expressions equivalent to ( [ lambda2running ] ) and ( [ lambda20fixpt ] ) can be obtained for a 5d flat spacetime with the extra dimension taken as an orbifolded circle .",
    "since there is no curvature @xmath15 , we measure the coupling @xmath34 with an arbitrary mass scale @xmath57 .",
    "we use the metric @xmath58 so that the @xmath40 function has no explicit @xmath28 dependence .",
    "we find @xmath59 there is no fixed point for @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath61 the fixed point is @xmath62 thus for massless or sufficiently light bulk fields there is no fixed point about which the rg flow simplifies .",
    "in particular there is no guarantee that one can match the original theory to an effective one in which the extra dimension is much smaller , with only small perturbations to the effective hidden brane action .",
    "that is a special property of having ( nearly ) ads bulk geometry . carefully taking the flat space limit of rs1",
    ", one can check that ( [ lambda2running ] ) makes a smooth transition to ( [ minkrunning ] ) .",
    "adding a tadpole term to both branes will allow us to reproduce the goldberger - wise stabilization mechanism @xcite using the rg analysis .",
    "since in this paper we are keeping a fixed background geometry for simplicity , we will necessarily be making the same approximation as goldberger and wise , of neglecting the back - reaction of the scalar profile on the geometry .",
    "however , we expect that the generalization to dynamical gravity is straightforward . exact solutions that exhibit stability have been examined in  @xcite . a perturbative approach to stability treating the back reaction in a systematic way",
    "was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "consider now the theory @xmath63 where we now use @xmath64 units .",
    "note that @xmath65 are constants , not functions of @xmath16 like @xmath66 .",
    "the field @xmath1 must satisfy the boundary condition @xmath67 as before we attempt to match onto a theory with the new hidden boundary , @xmath68    as in the previous section , we take the logarithmic derivative of this boundary condition , ( [ gwbc ] ) , and use the bulk equation of motion as well as ( [ gwbc ] ) to eliminate any @xmath3-derivatives of @xmath1 .",
    "we arrive at the equation @xmath69    we will formally treat the hidden boundary value of the field , @xmath70 , as allowed to take arbitrary values , leading to rg equations @xmath71 where the partial derivatives on the left act on the @xmath28 argument , not on the @xmath53 argument , which appears on the right . clearly solutions to these rg equations will solve ( [ tadandquad ] ) .",
    "however it is not actually true that @xmath70 can take on arbitrary values because of the extra boundary conditions imposed by the visible brane .",
    "thus we can view our rg equations as the unique ones which are independent of the details of the visible brane , very much like the more familiar mass and vev independent rg flows in energy scales .    in the goldberger - wise mechanism the scalar field sets up a stabilizing potential for the radion field the vev of which is @xmath72 .",
    "ignoring the gravitational backreaction as we have done gives the leading approximation in newton s constant to the radion potential .",
    "we may calculate this potential in the theory defined by ( [ gwaction ] ) as is done in ref .",
    "we may alternatively study the potential of the equivalent effective theory with the hidden brane run down to a location @xmath73 near the visible brane .",
    "the couplings on the hidden brane will be modified from the theory with hidden brane at @xmath21 as required by the rg flow .",
    "we consider a theory with hidden brane couplings close to the fixed point .",
    "we use the linearized flow equations .",
    "@xmath74 there are flow equations for the coefficients of higher derivative operators , @xmath75 .",
    "we do not consider these terms as we wish to find the effective radion potential which is evaluated at zero external momentum . solving the flow equations we have @xmath76 for such a small effective extra dimension we can neglect the bulk action and treat the field @xmath1 as constant across the extra dimension .",
    "the effective action then becomes @xmath77    as was found in refs .",
    "@xcite a large hierarchy can be generated by a moderately small scalar mass . in this case",
    "we will find after radion stabilization that @xmath78 .",
    "we have @xmath79 therefore , contributions in the effective potential due to the deviation from @xmath80 will be suppressed by @xmath81 .",
    "we may self - consistently neglect this term .",
    "the tadpole term in the action indicates a vev for @xmath1 .",
    "we find @xmath82 note that this corresponds precisely to the solution for @xmath1 found in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", a solution for @xmath1 to first order in @xmath83 and @xmath84 was found as a function of the extra - dimensional space .",
    "evaluating this solution at the location of the visible brane gives equation ( [ chivev ] ) .    substituting this expression for @xmath85 into the action we obtain an effective potential for the radion .",
    "@xmath86 minimizing this potential we find that a hierarchy is established .",
    "@xmath87 a large hierarchy is generated for a modest ratio of @xmath88 .",
    "we now apply the methods of the previous sections to a more general action .",

    "we will see that the rg flow preserves this general form .",
    "the equations of motion imply the hidden boundary condition z _ z ( x , z )    @xmath90 in the four dimensional variations that remain after integrating over the delta functions in @xmath3 in the equations of motion emerging from brane terms .    in analogy to ( [ bca ] ) , we look for a new local action @xmath91 which satisfies the boundary condition [ genbca ] z _ z ( x , z ) |_z =",

    "it is important to note that this equation is local in the couplings and the field @xmath94 since it is constructed from the variations of the presumed local action , @xmath91 .",
    "thus we have shown that local effective actions flow to local effective actions , and the boundary condition for the flow at @xmath95 is @xmath96 , which is local . to find the @xmath40 functions for each coupling , we expand ( [ chillipepper ] ) in powers of @xmath70 and the independent momenta , @xmath16 and require that each coefficient vanish .",
    "as in the previous section , this amounts to treating @xmath70 as free to take on any value in the set of 5d solutions , which is equivalent to choosing an rg flow which is independent of the details of the visible brane .",
    "since we have not considered higher - derivative interactions in the bulk , we have still not obtained the greatest generality .",
    "there is no obstruction to finding local rg flows in the most general case of higher bulk derivatives , an example of which appears in section [ bulkderivatives ] .    as an example of the use of equation ( [ chillipepper ] ) ,",
    "take the theory with the bulk interaction @xmath97 on the hidden brane we have @xmath98 we can calculate the running of @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "equation ( [ chillipepper ] ) gives @xmath101 where we take @xmath102 .",
    "our rg flow then follows by treating @xmath103 as a free variable , @xmath104    a central result of this present section is the robust retention of a fixed point in the rg flow in the presence of interactions , which is ir - attractive as long as the bulk mass - squared is positive . to see this recall that we have found in section ii a fixed point for the free theory : @xmath105 using ( [ chillipepper ] )",
    "one can straightforwardly find the linearized @xmath40 functions for flows near this fixed point when brane interactions are permitted , but bulk interactions are still absent .",
    "we find @xmath106 the scaling matrix , @xmath107 , is lower triangular ( operators with derivatives only mix with operators with fewer derivatives and @xmath108 and @xmath109 do not mix for @xmath110 ) , so that the eigenvalues are given by the diagonal elements .",
    "these eigenvalues are @xmath111 where @xmath112 indicates the number of @xmath1 fields in the operator and @xmath113 indicates the highest number of derivatives in that operator .",
    "the scaling dimensions are negative so this fixed point is attractive .",
    "we now add bulk interactions . from ( [ chillipepper ] ) one can see that the @xmath40 function will be corrected by a power series in bulk couplings ( actually a linear term at classical order ) . if these couplings are given the formal small parameter @xmath114 they will alter the rg flow by @xmath115 terms , which can not eliminate the fixed point but only shift its position by @xmath115 .",
    "the scaling dimensions will also receive an @xmath115 correction .",
    "the new fixed point will therefore be attractive for a sufficiently small @xmath114 .",
    "the robustness of the fixed point and the anomalous dimensions when interactions are included translates into the robustness of the goldberger - wise mechanism for stabilizing the hierarchy , which we see as follows . as long",
    "as our original hidden brane action is sufficiently close to the fixed point action , we are justified in using the linearized rg flow , given by the anomalous dimensions .",
    "as long as the strength of bulk couplings is sufficiently small , the @xmath114 mentioned above being at most of order the bulk mass - squared ( in @xmath116 units ) , the spectrum of anomalous dimensions is still given by one coupling with anomalous dimension of order @xmath117 , while the other couplings have anomalous dimensions which are of order @xmath118 or more negative .",
    "we will now repeat our goldberger - wise analysis as in the previous section , but now using this interacting rg flow . running the planck brane down to @xmath119 as before we drop derivative terms to find a vacuum potential of the form @xmath120 where the operators @xmath121 have scaling dimension @xmath122 .",
    "the functions @xmath123 and @xmath124 have no explicit @xmath125 dependence",
    ". we will show self - consistently that @xmath78 .",
    "we can then discard all terms suppressed by order one powers of @xmath126 as they are negligible .",
    "taking @xmath127 to be of order @xmath128 , only one hidden brane operator is relevant .",
    "we have @xmath129 notice that this potential has the form , @xmath130 where @xmath131 indicates a polynomial . for quite generic coefficients",
    "this indicates that solutions with @xmath132 minimize this potential .",
    "these relations are explicitly confirmed at leading order in @xmath114 in section iii were a large hierarchy is generated .",
    "we see that a large hierarchy will also be set including the @xmath115 ( and higher ) corrections . @xmath133",
    "in quantum field theory the quantities of physical interest are the @xmath134-point functions .",
    "take the theory of equation ( [ action ] ) with the hidden brane at @xmath4 .",
    "we may also consider a theory with the hidden brane at a location @xmath135 .",

    "this method of matching @xmath134-point functions is done at tree level in this paper and gives an alternate , equivalent way of calculating the flow equations for hidden brane couplings to that of the previous sections .",
    "we demonstrate this method through a few examples .",

    "we had restricted ourselves for simplicity to bulk interactions of the form of a potential . as an example of a perturbative calculation using the method of matching green s functions",

    "this demonstrates how @xmath167 interactions induce running in @xmath100 .",
    "note that other nonlinear contributions in the @xmath40 functions may be calculated through the diagrams of figure [ fourint ] .",
    "the two main directions for generalizing the above rg formalism are including higher spins and including quantum loops . spins greater than or equal to one raise an interesting subtlety not encountered in this paper .",
    "the usual cft interpretation of a bulk rs1 field is that it corresponds to a cft operator _ and _ to a fundamental 4d field coupled to that cft .",
    "therefore it is at first sight odd that in our rs1 examples we found exact fixed points without the deviations corresponding to the coupling to a fundamental 4d scalar .",
    "however , one can see that the hidden brane fixed point lagrangian found in this paper contains an effective - cutoff sized mass for the bulk scalar .",
    "the dual of this is a cft coupled to a cutoff - mass fundamental scalar that is a scalar heavy enough to be completely integrated out of the effective theory leaving the pure cft dynamics .",
    "now consider higher spins protected by gauge invariance . for concreteness we will consider gravity in the full rs1 model",
    ". we may want to keep the zero mode graviton ( dual to the fundamental 4d graviton coupled to the cft ) . in this case",
    "we must accomodate the complication that the effective hidden brane theory must describe `` almost '' fixed point behavior with small deviations arising from weak coupling to the zero mode graviton .",
    "quantum loops can be dealt with in a very similar manner to the methods of section vi .",
    "the central technical issue is a proof to all orders of the locality of the running effective hidden brane lagrangian .",
    "( we fully expect this locality . )",
    "once this is demonstrated , the rg approach will undoubtedly provide the simplest and most insightful proof of the stability of the rs - goldberger - wise hierarchy to all orders in the effective field theory .",
    "the method of proof would be almost identical to the proof of hierarchy robustness given here in section v for the classical interacting theory , which uses only the most general features of the rg flows .",
    "the importance of such a proof is easy to understand when one considers that the goldberger - wise effective potential is basically a weak - scale potential for the radius , whereas the rs1 effective theory , has access to planckian mass scales ( especially at the quantum level ) which naively threaten to overwhelm weak - scale effects .",
    "understanding how the potential is protected by such effects is a particular case illustrating the more general utility of the rg procedure , which is to identify where large dependences on the warp factor appear within feynman diagrams",
    ". another important application would be quantum corrections to the masses and decays of low lying kaluza - klein resonances .",
