    "intense experimental and theoretical work proceeds to explore the mechanisms of quark confinement effect and the properties of the vacuum state of quantum - chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the non - abelian gauge theory of ` color ' charges @xcite .",
    "relativistic energy nuclear collisions are the novel experimental tool developed in the past decade to form , study , and explore the ` melted ' space - time domain , where we hope to find , beyond the hagedorn temperature @xmath2 mev @xcite , freely propagating quarks and gluons in the ( color charge ) plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "analysis of hadronic particle production in relativistic nuclear collisions offers an opportunity to explore the mechanisms of quark confinement at the time of final state qgp freeze - out .",
    "we present here a progress report of such ongoing analysis of the recent and forthcoming experimental study of the pb ",
    "pb collisions at 158 a gev @xcite , which follows on our now complete analysis of the s  au / w / pb collision systems @xcite .",
    "there is little doubt that in the early universe qgp was the transient state of matter , and that only about 2040@xmath3sec into evolution did our present confining vacuum freeze - out from the primordial qgp - form .",
    "the issue is if in laboratory experiments we can indeed form and study the primordial qgp phase @xcite . in some aspects , such as specific entropy and baryon content , notable differences between the laboratory qgp state and the early universe conditions are present .",
    "also , the small , nuclear size of the nuclear collision ` micro'-bang implies a short laboratory lifespan @xmath4sec .",
    "there is also the difficult problem of proving the fundamental paradigm beyond a shade of doubt : can there indeed exist a locally deconfined space - time domain with energy density exceeding by an order of magnitude that of nuclear matter ? much of the current effort is solely addressing this question . among several proposed approaches to search for and study the deconfinement , our work relies on the idea of strangeness flavor enhancement , and the associated enhancement of ( strange ) antibaryon formation @xcite .",
    "this signature can be combined , in the present analysis , with the study of global particle abundance which represents the entropy contents of the deconfined phase @xcite .",
    "we address here 15 presently available particle yield ratios obtained in central pb ",
    "pb 158 a gev collision experiments carried out at cern - sps .",
    "our analysis addresses results of experiments na49 @xcite , and wa97 @xcite , we have not used results from na44 @xcite , being uncertain about the impact of the cascading weak decay contamination of the hadronic ratios , which are quite significant .",
    "four wa97 data points involve @xmath0 and @xmath1 particles and even a cursory study of these abundances suggests that these entirely strange particles are not falling into the same systematic class , a fact also visible in their unusual spectral slopes .",
    "we believe in view of the difference in systematics that it is appropriate also to consider the data excluding the @xmath0 and @xmath1 yields from analysis . in that case",
    "our analysis contains 11 relative experimental particle yields .",
    "however , 4 of these ratios originating in the same experiment are related by a simple algebraic constraint ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xmath5 ) , leaving us with ten independent measurements .",
    "as we shall see , there are up to 5 parameters in our description . in the different analysis discussed here",
    "we thus have no less than 5 independent degrees of freedom : @xmath6 .",
    "since we address ratios of strange particles as well as ratios of total abundances of positive and negative hadrons , we combine in the present analysis strangeness observables with the entropy enhancement @xcite .",
    "underlying our data analysis is the assumption of local thermal ( _ i.e. , _ energy equipartition ) equilibrium .",
    "both , the thermal appearance of produced particle spectra @xcite , and the qualitative and systematic agreement over many orders of magnitude between properties of a thermal hadron system and the experimental hadron abundance yields @xcite , provide a solid foundation for the assumption of ( near ) thermal equilibrium in the dense hadronic matter .    in our most recent theoretical approach",
    "there is a key refinement not present in earlier work @xcite : we do not assume chemical equilibrium even for light quarks .",
    "consideration of non - equilibrium chemical abundance for strange quarks allowed to analyze accurately the experimental particle abundance data and to characterize precisely the properties of the presumably deconfined source @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms of chemical equilibration requiring reactions which change particle abundances are today much better understood theoretically than those responsible for what is believed to be much faster thermal ( kinetic ) equilibration , where momentum exchange between existent particles is the key mechanism .",
    "it is hard to understand , why we , along with others , have maintained in the past in our analysis the point of view that only strangeness has the opportunity to be off - equilibrium in chemical abundance .",
    "indeed , if qgp is the particle source the need to assimilate by fragmentation the gluon content must generate excess light quark abundance . since we did not allow for this freedom in earlier data analysis , the data were ( equally badly ) also described by a high temperature source model  @xcite .",
    "this is not the case once also for light quarks the chemical nonequilibrium is introduced , only the low temperature freeze - out alternative has a convincing statistical significance    hadronic particles we observe are either emitted directly or are descendants of other hadronic primaries produced near or at surface of the dense matter fireball .",
    "local rest - frame temperature @xmath7 and local collective flow velocity @xmath8 characterize the momentum space distribution of particles emerging from the surface region of the fireball .",
    "in addition , each surface volume element is characterized by chemical abundance factors we shall discuss in more detail below . only particles of similar mass and cross section experience similar drag forces arising from local flow of matter and hence ratio of their abundances in some limited region of phase space for not too small momenta is expected to remain unaltered by @xmath8 . since the surface vector flow @xmath8 is a priori largely unknown , in order to use limited ` windows ' of particle momenta ( rapidity @xmath9 and transverse mass @xmath10 ) for determination of chemical freeze - out properties of the source , only ratios of ` mutually compatible ' particles can be considered , aside of ratios of total particle abundances .",
    "our recent study of the flow effect shows that this procedure is adequate , though with the ongoing improvement of the data sample we will soon have to include this additional freeze - out flow velocity parameter explicitly in the analysis  @xcite .    in the following section",
    ", we shall briefly summarize the theoretical foundations of the current analysis and discuss the impact of coulomb effect in qgp on the expected values of statistical parameters , and we shall describe the parameters that we obtain . in section [ particles ] , we will discuss the particle abundances and other related results , such as the physical properties of the freeze - out dense matter .",
    "we conclude with a few brief remarks about the relevance of our analysis for the search for qgp .",
    "the thermal production yield @xmath11 of particles emitted within the time @xmath12 from a locally at rest surface element @xmath13 is : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the particle velocity normal to the surface element @xmath16 . for a thermal quark - gluon gas source and allowing for recombination - fragmentation of constituents and detailed balance , the complete phase space occupancy factor @xmath17",
    "is given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the degeneracy of the produced particle , and @xmath20 its energy .",
    "the valance quark content @xmath21 in hadron @xmath22 is implied in eq.([ai ] ) .",
    "the fugacities @xmath23 arise from conservation laws , in our context , of quark ( baryon ) number and strangeness in the particle source .",
    "@xmath24 is thus the fugacity of the valance light quarks . for a nucleon @xmath25 , and hence the baryochemical potential",
    "is : @xmath26 .",
    "similarly , for strange quarks we have @xmath27 . for an antiparticle fugacity @xmath28 .",
    "some papers refer in this context to hyper - charge fugacity @xmath29 , thus @xmath30 .",
    "this is a highly inconvenient historical definition arising from considerations of a hypothetical hadron gas phase .",
    "it hides from view important symmetries , such as @xmath31 for a state in which the phase space size for strange and anti - strange quarks is the same : at finite baryon density the number of hyperons is always greater than the number of anti - hyperons and thus the requirement @xmath32 can only be satisfied for some nontrivial @xmath33 .",
    "thus even a small deviation from @xmath34 limit must be fully understood in order to argue that the source is deconfined .",
    "conversely , observation of @xmath35 consistently at different experimental conditions is a strong and convincing argument that at least the strange quarks are unbound , _",
    "i.e. , _ deconfined .",
    "as this discussion also illustrates , the parameter @xmath36 does not regulate the total number of @xmath37-@xmath38 quark - pairs present in the system .",
    "more generally , any compound object comprising a particle - antiparticle pair is not controlled in abundance by a fugacity , since the formation of such particles does not impact the conservation laws . in consequence , the abundance of , _",
    "neutral pions comprises no quark fugacity .",
    "this is the reason to introduce an additional chemical phase space occupancy factor @xmath39 : the effective fugacity of quarks is @xmath40 and antiquarks @xmath41 .",
    "this parameter allows to control pair abundance independently of other properties of the system , and in particular temperature . for @xmath42",
    "one reaches a entropy maximum @xcite , corresponding to the ` absolute ' chemical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "therefore the factor @xmath39 is called the ( chemical ) phase space occupancy factor .",
    "a time dependent build up of chemical abundance was first considered in the context of microscopic strangeness production in qgp @xcite , after it was realized that strange flavor production occurs at the same time scale as the collision process .",
    "more generally , one must expect , considering the time scales , that all quark flavors will not be able to exactly follow the rapid evolution in time of dense hadronic matter .",
    "moreover , fragmentation of gluons in hadronizing qgp can contribute additional quark pair abundance , conveniently described by the factor @xmath39 .",
    "it is thus to be expected that also for light quarks the chemical phase space occupancy factor @xmath43 .",
    "introduction of the factor @xmath44 leads to a precise chemical description of the s  au / w / pb 200 a gev collisions @xcite , which was not possible before .",
    "the tacit choice @xmath45 has not allowed previously to distinguish the different reaction scenarios in pb  pb collisions @xcite , where we found analyzing the experimental data that hadronic particles could be born either at high temperature @xmath46mev or at expected hadronization temperature @xmath47mev .",
    "introduction of @xmath44 , along with improvement in precision , allowance for quantum ( bose / fermi ) corrections to the boltzmann distribution functions , and a greater data sample , allowed us moreover to recognize the systematic difference between data points containing , and resp .",
    ", not containing @xmath48 , allowing us to develop the precise analysis here presented .    in another refinement",
    "both @xmath49-flavor fugacities @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be introduced , allowing for up - down - quark asymmetry @xcite .",
    "we recall that by definition @xmath52 , thus @xmath53 . for the highly coulomb - charged fireballs formed in pb ",
    "pb collisions a further effect of the same relative magnitude which needs consideration is the distortion of the particle phase space by the coulomb potential .",
    "this effect influences particles and antiparticles in opposite way , and has by factor two different strength for @xmath54-quark ( charge @xmath55 ) and ( @xmath56)-quarks ( charge @xmath57 ) . because coulomb - effect acts in opposite way on @xmath54 and @xmath58 quarks , its net impact on @xmath59 is relatively small as we shall see",
    "however , the coulomb effect distorts significantly the expectation regarding @xmath31 for strangeness - deconfined source with vanishing net strangeness .",
    "the difference between strange and anti - strange quark numbers ( net strangeness ) allowing for a coulomb potential within a relativistic thomas - fermi phase space occupancy model @xcite , allowing for finite temperature in qgp is : @xmath60\\,,\\ ] ] which clearly can not vanish for @xmath61 in the limit @xmath34 . in eq.([nsls ] ) the subscript @xmath62 on the spatial integral reminds us that only the classically allowed region within the fireball is covered in the integration over the level density ; @xmath63 , and for a uniform charge distribution within a radius @xmath64 of charge @xmath65 : @xmath66\\ , ,            & \\mbox{for}\\quad r < r_{\\rm f}\\,;\\\\   & \\\\",

    "it turns out that there is always only one solution , with resulting @xmath69 .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is quite significant : choosing @xmath70fm , @xmath71mev , @xmath72mev ( value of @xmath73 is irrelevant ) solution of eq.([nsls ] ) for @xmath74 yields @xmath75 ( precisely : 1.0983 , 1.10 corresponds to @xmath76fm ) .",
    "this result is consistent with one of the scenarios we reported earlier for pb ",
    "pb collisions @xcite .",
    "thus we are reassured that the experimental data is very likely consistent with deconfined quark source , and hence a detailed verification of this hypothesis is needed .",

    "we have presented detailed analysis of hadron abundances observed in central pb  pb interactions at 158 a gev in terms of thermal equilibrium and chemical non - equilibrium phase space model of ( strange ) hadronic particles .",
    "we assumed formation of a thermal dense matter fireball of a priori unknown structure , which explodes and disintegrates into the final state hadrons .",
    "we have presented several excellent descriptions of all abundance data which at present comprise 5 or more independent degrees of freedom , yielding a family of models with acceptable confidence level .",
    "the physical statistical parameters obtained characterize a strange particle source which , when allowing for coulomb deformation of the strange and anti - strange quarks , is exactly symmetric , as is natural _ only _ for a deconfined state . while the statistical parameters shown in table [ fitpb ] can vary widely there is no way to distinguish with naked eye the different approaches d , d@xmath79 , d@xmath81 , d@xmath82 inspecting the particle abundances shown in table [ resultpb ] .",
    "it is important to take note that along with @xmath85 there also is a stable value @xmath86 under the different strategies one may follow to analyze the experimental data .",
    "the chemical freeze - out temperature allowing for the systematic uncertainty seen in the acceptable group of models in table [ fitpb ] is @xmath87 mev , and this implies that the freeze - out baryochemical potential is @xmath88mev .",
    "the error here is small , since the best values @xmath89 are anti - correlated .",
    "given these statistical parameters we have also evaluated the physical properties of the hadronic particle phase space , such as energy , entropy and baryon number .",

    "these correspond nearly exactly to the initial state conditions , confirming the consistency of our approach and validating the reaction picture applied .",
    "this part of our analysis confirms that the reaction proceeds by the way of the formation of a dense fireball comprising highly excited hadronic matter . in consistency with this",
    "we obtain values of @xmath36 which exactly match expectations for strangeness balance in qgp , allowing for the coulomb effect within the particle source of the size @xmath90fm .",
    "we compare conditions of the particle source for the two systems pb  pb and s  au / w / pb and find that both can be seen as hadronizing in same physical conditions .",

    "we find , see table [ tqpb ] and @xcite that the different physical properties of the two hadronic source agree .",
    "this , along with the strange phase space symmetry and the coulomb effect , we believe that the sole possible interpretation the formation of a deconfined phase in the initial stages of the collision , which subsequently evolves and flows apart till it reaches the universal hadronization point , with many similar physical properties , independent of the collision system .",
    "system dependent will certainly be the surface collective velocity @xmath8 @xcite , however , our analysis was organized such that this vector field did not enter here in a significant way .",
    "we have begun , using quark - gluon plasma equations of state which incorporate the perturbative corrections and thermal masses , to study detailed scenarios of qgp formation and evolution that leads to the freeze - out properties we obtained here .",
    "the important preliminary finding is that it is possible to find qgp - fireballs that naturally lead to the results obtained studying the experimental hadron abundance data , and thus the qgp hypothesis presented here is also consistent with our current theoretical understanding of the qgp equations of state .",
