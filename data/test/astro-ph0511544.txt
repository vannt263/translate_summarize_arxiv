    "the sample is composed of 70 archival _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) images of low - redshift qsos .",
    "they have redshifts between @xmath2 and total ( host plus nucleus ) absolute magnitudes brighter than @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , they must have been observed with the _ hst _ s wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) , using broad - band filters , and have images publicly available in the _ hst _ archives as of 1999 .",
    "this brings our sample to 70 qsos . rather than restrict our study to a specific class of qsos",
    ", we impose no physical criteria on the qsos beyond those of magnitude and redshift .",
    "thus we are able to study a broad range of properties and draw general conclusions .",
    "the images are reduced and the physical parameters fitted as described by hamilton et al .",
    "for our principal components analysis ( pca ) , we use a restricted sample of those qsos for which we have all of the following parameters : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , where @xmath7 is the effective surface magnitude of the galactic bulge .",
    "we further require that each qso have a modeled , spheroidal bulge ( the entire galaxy , in the case of elliptical hosts ) .",
    "these qualifications restrict the sample to 42 qsos .",
    "we can perform two pcas , an optical one using @xmath4 , @xmath8 , and @xmath7 as the parameters , and an x - ray one that substitutes @xmath9 for the nuclear luminosity . from the optical pca performed on this sample of 42 objects",
    ", we find that 96.1% of the variance can be explained with just the first two principal axes , and therefore the qsos mostly lie in a plane within this parameter space .",
    "this we consider to be a fundamental plane ( fp ) for qsos . for the corresponding x - ray results ,",
    "the first two principal axes explain 95.2% of the variance in the sample , and we find here an x - ray qso fundamental plane .",
    "the individual subsamples of qsos ( radio - loud or radio - quiet , with spiral or elliptical hosts , and all combinations of these ) are also examined in this way , and they show fundamental planes , as well .    we obtain the optical and x - ray formulae for the full sample s fundamental plane : @xmath10 @xmath11 views of the optical and x - ray fundamental planes , with the qso data points superimposed , are displayed in figure  [ fig : fp - phys ] .",
    "note that the host properties describe the horizontal and the nuclear luminosity the vertical in these plots .",
    "figure  [ fig : fp - rms ] illustrates the precision of the qso fundamental plane in both forms , with the plane plotted against the measured host sizes .",
    "its highest precision is found when solving for @xmath8 .",
    "the fundamental plane for qsos shows a relationship between the nuclear and host features that goes beyond the simple ( and weak ) correlation of nuclear and host luminosities .",
    "this behavior may be connected to other , known relations between the objects . for example , there is already a well - studied fundamental plane for normal , elliptical galaxies ( djorgovski & davis  1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) that incorporates galaxy size , @xmath6 , central velocity dispersion , @xmath12 , and effective surface magnitude , @xmath7 .",
    "let us take a @xmath13-band measurement of the normal galaxy fundamental plane ( scodeggio et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath14 .",
    "the ratio of the coefficients of @xmath8 to @xmath7 differs by about 37% between the qso optical fundamental plane and the normal galaxy fp , and the qso x - ray fp shows a 34% difference .",
    "still , there is a formal similarity between the qso and normal fundamental planes , which might point to a link between the host galaxy s central velocity dispersion and the nuclear luminosity of the qso .",
    "this could derive from the fueling mechanism of qsos , if the movement of gas to the center of the galaxy and the black hole is related to the velocity dispersion .",
    "it is therefore tempting to try to derive the qso fundamental plane directly from the elliptical galaxy fundamental plane , but we find two problems with this approach , both arising from the relation of black hole mass to nuclear luminosity . using the velocity dispersion to black hole mass relation of merritt & ferrarese  ( 2001 ) , @xmath15 we can put the elliptical galaxy fundamental plane in terms of black hole mass . using the observed ( but weak ) correlation between black hole mass and nuclear luminosity in our sample , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we obtain @xmath18 @xmath19 these are our attempts to derive the qso optical fundamental plane from the normal galaxy fp .",
    "the optical form differs from the actual qso fp , equation  ( [ equ : oall - physical ] ) , completely outside the propagated errors , but the x - ray form is within the errors of equation  ( [ equ : xall - physical ] ) .",
    "but any derivation of the qso fundamental plane has an additional problem . as mentioned before",
    ", the qso fundamental plane for the full sample is composed of individual fps of the several subsamples .",
    "some subsample fps actually slope in the opposite direction from the overall qso fp .",
    "for example , in the optical form , the fp of radio - quiets in elliptical hosts slopes in the opposite direction . and in the x - ray form , the radio - quiet subsamples slope oppositely from the overall sample .",
    "yet these differences can not be accounted for by different correlations of nuclear luminosity with black hole mass .",
    "the poor correlation of black hole mass with nuclear luminosity lies in contrast with the relatively thin qso fundamental plane .",
    "furthermore , woo & urry  ( 2002 ) suggest that the apparent correlations between black hole mass and nuclear luminosity are merely artifacts of sample selection .",
    "regardless of how we take this interpretation , the relationship between black hole mass and nuclear luminosity remains the missing link in any derivation of the qso fundamental plane .",
    "the insight into the origins of this new fundamental plane relationship might come from the comparison of the qso subsample fps .",
    "the thickness of the overall qso fundamental plane appears partly to be the result of the superposition of the subsamples planes .",
    "because the qso fp mathematically describes a link between the host and the nucleus , it seems reasonable to suppose that the slope of the plane depends on the physical nature of this link .",
    "the fueling mechanism at a qso s core would seem to be the most directly related to this , depending on how we define `` fueling mechanism . ''",
    "we could encompass within this term the details of the structure and dynamics of the accretion disk , as well as question of whether the qso is efficiently or inefficiently fueled .",
    "it is intriguing that as we change from one class to another , the fundamental plane essentially pivots about an axis , so the differences are mostly reduced to a single dimension , the slope ( or gradient ) relative to the @xmath7@xmath8 plane . the gradient directions , projected onto the @xmath7@xmath8 plane , are almost all either aligned ( or anti - aligned , for those with opposite slope ) .",
    "the optical subsample gradient directions are never more than 3.8 degrees away from that of the full sample , and in the x - ray form , they never exceed a 6.4 degree deviation .",
    "radio - loudness has the strongest effect on the slopes . in the x - ray form",
    ", the subsample fps are almost evenly divided between those aligned with the full sample and those anti - aligned . in the optical form ,",
    "only radio - quiets in elliptical hosts tilt opposite to the full sample .",
    "this effect is interesting because we are seeing a stark difference between the radio - loud and radio - quiet nuclei in the hosts of the same morphology",
    ".    it would be interesting to find if the different qso fp orientations described above come about from different fueling mechanisms that might be found in the various subsamples .",
    "we see , for instance , that radio - quiet and radio - loud qsos are characterized by very different slopes in their x - ray fps , but the understanding of what makes these qso types differ is still too limited to speculate further here . in our ongoing research",
    ", we are expanding the fundamental plane study to other types of agn .",
    "we can then compare their fp orientations with those of the different qso subsamples , which may teach us more about the physics underlying the qso fundamental plane .",
    "we should ask if lower luminosity classes of agn ( such as seyferts or llagn ) also have fundamental planes of this sort .",
    "if they do , how do they compare with that of qsos ?",
    "we can imagine four possibilities :    1 .",
    "they share the same fundamental plane as qsos .",
    "this would indicate that agn power scales with the host properties , even across agn types , and would support some form of unification .",
    "the plane is parallel to that of qsos , but shifted to lower nuclear luminosities .",
    "this would show that these host properties do nt determine the agn class , and a given galaxy could host different types .",
    "the plane is tilted with respect to that of qsos .",
    "then the fundamental plane slope would be characteristic of the agn type , possibly supporting the idea that the slope is tied to the accretion mechanism .",
    "4 .   there is no fundamental plane whatsoever . in that case",
    ", this type of fundamental plane would be a unique property of qsos .",
    "high - luminosity objects would be more closely connected with their host properties ."
