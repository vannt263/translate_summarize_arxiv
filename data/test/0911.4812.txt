    "far - off - resonant laser pulses are a popular tool for inducing controllable phase shifts in atomic states . these phase shifts",
    " usually referred to as dynamic stark shifts  are frequently used in the construction of dynamic phase gates , which are a basic tool in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "in many algorithms ( e.g. grover s quantum search @xcite ) one has to prepare such phase shifts very accurately @xcite . insofar as quantum algorithms involve a great number of phase gates , the accuracy of the latter is of crucial importance for high - fidelity quantum information processing .",
    "there are three major types of phase gates : dynamic @xcite , geometric @xcite and using relative laser phases @xcite .",
    "while the latter two types have certain advantages in terms of robustness against parameter fluctuations , these come at the cost of more demanding implementations .",
    "the dynamic phase gate benefits from the simplicity of implementation ( because , unlike the other phase gates , it requires just a single off - resonant pulsed field ) , which determines its wide - spread use .",
    "we emphasize that such phase shifts also emerge in various more traditional dynamical problems involving complicated linkage patterns .",
    "the quantum dynamics of these multistate systems can often be understood only by reduction to simpler two- or three - state systems by using _",
    "adiabatic elimination _ of all far - off - resonant ( virtual ) states .",
    "for instance , it is mandatory to account for such dynamic stark shifts in excitation of multiphoton transitions by femtosecond laser pulses @xcite .    as far as a phase shift of @xmath1",
    "is concerned the simplest approach is to use a resonant @xmath2 pulse .",
    "a variable phase shift @xmath3 , however , requires a field with a suitable detuning and intensity ; such a variable phase shift is required , for example , in deterministic quantum search @xcite .    the dynamic stark shift , and the ensuing phase shift , are usually calculated by eliminating adiabatically the off - resonant state(s ) . in this paper",
    "we show that , unless applied very carefully , the adiabatic elimination ( ae ) approximation can lead to significant errors in the value of the phase .",
    "we analyze various sources of errors , ranging from higher terms in the ae expansion to population decay and shifts from additional states @xcite , and show that the standard ae approximation is accurate only for _ very _ large detuning @xmath4 ( sec .",
    "[ sec - ae ] ) .",
    "we then present a method for the evaluation of the phase based on the adiabatic approximation ( sec .",
    "[ sec - adiabatic ] ) .",
    "this approximation provides a simple formula for the gate phase , which contains the ae phase as a limiting case for @xmath5 , but it is also valid for moderately large detunings ( @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the pulse width )",
    ". then we include superadiabatic corrections ( sec .",
    "[ sec - superadiabatic ] ) , dissipation ( sec .",

    "we consider a two - state quantum system ( a qubit ) interacting with a coherent field ( fig .",
    "[ fig - linkages ] , left ) and we wish to estimate the accumulated phase during this interaction .",
    "the phase gate is defined as [ phase gate ] = , where @xmath8 is the desired form of the propagator @xmath9 at the final time @xmath10 .",
    "the propagator @xmath9 satisfies the schrdinger equation @xcite , @xmath11 with the initial condition @xmath12 at time @xmath13 .",
    "this propagator allows us to calculate the phases of the two states , accumulated during the interaction , for arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian in the interaction representation and the rotating - wave approximation reads [ h - int ] = 2 , with @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the detuning between the laser carrier frequency @xmath16 and the bohr transition frequency @xmath17 . for simplicity , we assume hereafter that the detuning is constant , @xmath18 ; the results can be readily extended to time - dependent @xmath19 .",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath20 parameterizes the coupling between the electric field with an envelope @xmath21 and the transition dipole moment @xmath22 of the system .        in terms of the two probability amplitudes of the qubit states",

    "we begin with the traditional adiabatic elimination . to this end , it is suitable , with the phase transformation @xmath32 , @xmath33 , to write the schrdinger equation in the energy picture , [ se - energy ] ib_1&= & b_2 , [ se1-energy ] + ib_2&= & b_1 + b_2 , [ se2-energy ] with the initial conditions @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the ae approximation is applicable when the field is tuned far off resonance ( @xmath36 ) , which implies a small transition probability .",

    "the reason is that in an expansion for a phase it is not sufficient to retain the leading term and demand the next term to be much smaller than it ; one must also demand _ all _ neglected terms to be _ much smaller than unity_. obviously , terms of the order of unity or larger can not be discarded in the estimate of the phase because the latter is defined modulo @xmath2 ; hence the leading term alone may provide a value that is not even close to the exact value .",

    "we have put a special emphasis on the acquired phase shifts in the probability amplitudes after the interaction with an off - resonant pulsed field .",
    "the results have direct implications in the construction of variable dynamic phase gates , which are of major importance in quantum information processing .",
    "we have shown that in the traditional implementation with a far off - resonance pulsed field , the formula for the gate phase derived by the adiabatic - elimination approximation , has to be used with great care because it is just the first term of a series expansion in the inverse detuning @xmath147 ; higher terms , unless negligible in value with respect to unity , may render the formula irrelevant .",
    "this formula requires a _ very large detuning _ in order to be sufficiently accurate , because including corrections from higher terms is barely useful due to their complexity and slow convergence .",
    "however , quantum information processing involves operations with entangled many - qubit systems , possessing a variety of frequency modes ; there a very large detuning may violate the assumption of single - mode interactions .",
    "we have proposed to use a much more accurate formula for the phase shift , derived within the adiabatic - following approximation .",
    "the advantage of this adiabatic phase is that the condition for adiabatic evolution is much more relaxed than the condition for adiabatic elimination .",
    "the adiabatic phase contains the ae approximation as a limiting case for @xmath5 ; however , it also applies to _ moderate",
    "_ detunings .",
    "the adiabatic phase applies also to the case when the peak rabi frequency @xmath49 exceeds the detuning @xmath4 ; in this case the phase gate operates due to the effect of adiabatic population return .",
    "a superadiabatic correction is demonstrated to further improve the accuracy , to errors comfortably below the fault - tolerance limit of @xmath0 in quantum computing .",
    "we have also derived the corrections to the gate phase from additional states coupled to the two qubit states .",
    "in addition , we have derived several _ exact _",
    "expressions for the gate phase in several exactly soluble analytical two - state and three - state models , assuming a hyperbolic - secant pulse shape .",
    "the exact analytical formulae allow us to design highly accurate phase gates , however , at the expense ot the requirement for a special pulse shape .",
    "we have also used the exact expressions to test the accuracy of the derived ae and adiabatic approximations .",
    "the results in this paper have potential applications not only in the calculation of dynamical stark phase shifts in simple phase gates but also in complicated multistate linkage patterns , which can be factorized to simpler systems by utilising the intrinsic symmetries , e.g. by the morris - shore transformation .",
