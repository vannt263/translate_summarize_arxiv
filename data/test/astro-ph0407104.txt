    "the explosion of a chandrasekhar mass white dwarf as a type ia supernova is one of the most dramatic events that can befall a star and , at the same time , one of the most complex .",
    "the outcome depends on details of the ignition process ( woosley , wunsch , & kuhlen 2004 ) and the uncertain physics of turbulent flame propagation ( see hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 , gamezo et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "both of these depend on the presupernova evolution of the star which sets e.g. , the central density at the time of runaway and the distribution of ignition points .",
    "however , since pioneering studies in the 1970 s by paczynski ( 1972 ) , couch & arnett ( 1973 , 1974 , 1975 ) , and iben ( 1978 ) , comparatively little attention has been given to the evolution of the interior of the _ presupernova _ star .",
    "it is known that the star ignites carbon centuries before it finally explodes , commencing a long ramp up that eventually concludes when convection can no longer carry away the excess energy generated by the degenerate nuclear runaway .",
    "it is during this phase that the urca process may lead to a complex convective structure in the core and perhaps even oscillations related to the switching on and off of urca neutrino losses ( iben 1978 ) . in this paper",
    "we consider a comparatively simple question : `` is presupernova carbon burning inherently unstable - even in the absence of urca losses '' ?",
    "carbon burning occurs at a rate that is extremely temperature sensitive , at least t@xmath2 even at the end of the stable burning near @xmath3 k. the white dwarf is also supported chiefly by degenerate electrons that are relativistic , hence @xmath4 . in other contexts in stellar evolution",
    ", this combination often tends towards instability ( e.g. , ledoux 1941 ; maeder 1985 ; baraffe , heger , & woosley 2001 ) .",
    "large excursions in the radius are not strongly damped and the non - linearity of the reaction rate promotes instability .",
    "this is known as the @xmath0-mechanism ( unno et al .",
    "such an instability leads to oscillations around the hydrostatic equilibrium configuration and periodic phases of expansion and contraction on a dynamical timescale @xmath5 .",
    "these types of oscillations are described as acoustic modes .",
    "they can be excited if an excitation mechanism operates in regions where the amplitude of eigenfunctions is large .",
    "we have thus undertaken a linear stability analysis of the structure of chandrasekhar mass white dwarf models prior to explosion , based on a similar analysis performed for very massive stars ( baraffe et al.2001 ) .",
    "we pick up the white dwarf when it has just ignited carbon ( nuclear energy generation substantially in excess of plasma neutrino losses ) and is developing an extended convective core .",
    "the central temperature at this point is @xmath6k and it is about 300 years until the star s death .",
    "the evolutionary models and input physics used are described in  2 and the results of the linear stability analysis are presented in  3 .",
    "a discussion follows in  4 .",
    "following ignition , a convective region develops in the white dwarf that eventually grows to encompass most of its mass .",
    "heat is transported outwards , but both radiative losses and neutrino losses are negligible .",
    "instead , the energy mostly goes into heating the convective portion of the star , and , to a lesser extent , expansion .",
    "the heat capacity is given by @xmath7 \\ \\",
    "\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{erg}}{10 ^ 8\\,\\mathrm{g\\,k}}\\right ) \\label{heatcap } \\end{split}\\ ] ] ( woosley et al . 2004 ) , where @xmath8 is the specific internal energy , @xmath9 t/@xmath10k and @xmath11/@xmath12g@xmath13@xmath14 . for the relevant temperature and density range ,",
    "@xmath15 = 2 to 7 , @xmath16 to 3 , the ionic term dominates with a minor contribution from the electrons . to a factor - of - two accuracy , @xmath17 erg g@xmath18",
    "( 10@xmath19k)@xmath18 .",
    "the total thermal energy is @xmath20 \\ 4 \\pi r^2 \\ dr\\ ] ]    the correct definition for pure `` thermal energy '' should be expressed in terms of @xmath21 rather than @xmath22 , since @xmath22 also contains an expansion term @xmath23 .",
    "however , because of strong degeneracy in the interior of the white dwarf , @xmath24 and eq .  ( 2 ) provides a good estimate of the thermal heat content .",
    "moreover , for our purpose below , to estimate the gravothermal heat content , this is the appropriate quantity to use . if the mass - averaged temperature is about half the central value and the convection zone , about one solar mass , @xmath25 where the index `` c '' stands for central quantities of the star",
    "actually , from computer models discussed in the next section we know that the convective core grows from 0.2 m  to 1.15 m  as the central temperature rises from @xmath26 k to @xmath27 k ( see table [ tab1 ] )",
    ". a better estimate of the heat in the convective region is @xmath28 this actually agrees to much better than factor - of - two accuracy with the detailed computer results described in the next section .",
    "the total nuclear power generated by the star is ( woosley et al . 2004 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 for the relevant range of temperature and @xmath31 is the carbon mass fraction .",
    "this expression is valid in the temperature range @xmath32 and becomes increasingly inaccurate at lower temperature because of temperature dependence of @xmath33 and especially the complex dependence of the screening correction on temperature and density .",
    "the nuclear timescale , which characterizes the increase of nuclear energy generation rate in the center , taking into account the reaction of the rest of the star , is @xmath34 where it is assumed that @xmath35 ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "since the central temperature , or the total heat content of the star need only increase @xmath363% for the power to double , the white dwarf evolution is governed by the rise of the power , @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the nuclear timescale @xmath38 and the time to explosion are the same and both are considerably shorter , by about a factor of 5 , than the thermal time scale @xmath39 .",
    "the star takes a few centuries to go from ignition at @xmath40 k to @xmath27 k , but explodes a few minutes later .",
    "this is a considerably longer time scale than one would get by evaluating a _",
    "local _ nuclear timescale @xmath41 , just from the central energy generation rate and heat capacity , because the cooler middle regions of the white dwarf act as an appreciable heat reservoir for the energy generation .",
    "until the central temperature exceeds @xmath27 k , convection keeps the two efficiently coupled ( see discussion in  4 ) .",

    "the accretion was stopped when the runaway had started , but about 80 centuries before the final incineration , to allow the addition of the well - resolved surface layers .",
    "at this point the star has reached a central density of @xmath60 and a central temperature of @xmath61 . in the remaining time",
    "the star would have accreted less than @xmath62 , which does not affect the structure of the star or the runaway ( note that the runaway occurs many times that mass before reaching the chandrasekhar mass ) .",
    "the lagrangian grid uses zone masses ranging from 10@xmath63 g in the center over some @xmath64 g in the middle of the star to a smooth gradient in zone size down to 10@xmath65 g at the surface .",
    "convection is treated using standard mixing length theory with a mixing length @xmath66 .    during the last @xmath36 300yr prior to explosion the nuclear energy generation rate , @xmath67 , rises rapidly in the center of the white dwarf .",

    "an important uncertainty in the present analysis is due to the assumption that convection is frozen in , neglecting the perturbation of the convective flux .",
    "this simplification is based on the argument that the convective timescales in the interior of the white dwarf remain significantly larger than the period of pulsation of the excited modes ( see below ) .",
    "a sequence of evolutionary models is analyzed , starting from a central temperature @xmath70 , @xmath36 300 yr before explosion , to @xmath71 , corresponding to @xmath36 10 minutes before explosion .",

    "the @xmath8-folding time characterizing the growth timescale of the pulsation amplitude is defined by @xmath76 . in all models analyzed , this fundamental growth timescale is , by at least one order of magnitude , shorter than @xmath77 of the higher order modes .",
    "our analysis below can thus be restricted to the fundamental mode , since it is the mode which grows the fastest .",
    "table  2 summarizes the stability analysis results .",
    "the fundamental mode pulsation period @xmath78 is @xmath36 2 s , close to the dynamical timescale .",

    "the positive value of d@xmath82/d@xmath83 in the center is due to the perturbation of the nuclear energy generation rate and characterizes the @xmath0-mechanism .",

    "linear stability analysis alone does not provide information about the maximum pulsation amplitude which can be finally reached . for this purpose ,",
    "full hydrodynamical calculations are needed .",
    "however , comparison between the growth timescale @xmath77 of an excited mode and the evolutionary timescale @xmath46 can indicate whether the perturbation may have time to grow in order to reach large amplitudes . before doing such comparisons , it is useful to consider the uncertainties affecting the evolutionary timescale .    as previously discussed in  2.1 , the relevant timescale characterizing the evolution to explosion is considerably longer than the local nuclear timescale because of the heat reservoir provided by convective coupling to the rest of the star . for an @xmath0-mechanism",
    ", the growth timescale is expected to be closely related to the local nuclear timescale , since @xmath86 characterizes the increase of local nuclear energy generation rate in the central region where the @xmath0-mechanism takes place ( see fig .",

    "qualitatively , convection can lengthen the evolutionary timescale compared to the local nuclear timescale , and thus @xmath87 .    for the sake of a quantitative comparison",
    ", we have performed test evolutionary sequences with different convection efficiencies , in terms of the mixing length parameter @xmath88 .",

    "the long - dashed line corresponds to the case @xmath92 . as expected , when convection is inhibited ,",
    "the runaway timescale is essentially determined by the local nuclear timescale . on the opposite , the more efficient the convection , the longer the evolutionary timescale compared to @xmath86 .",
    "[ fig3 ] indicates that even in the unrealistic case with @xmath90 , the evolutionary timescale is at most @xmath36 70 times greater than @xmath86 .",

    "[ fig4 ] , @xmath77 follows @xmath86 , with @xmath77/@xmath94 , the same relation of proportionality being found independently of convection efficiency . since the tests on convection efficiency suggest that @xmath46 @xmath95 100 @xmath86 , the quantity @xmath77 thus remains systematically larger than the evolutionary timescale @xmath46 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . for standard convection",
