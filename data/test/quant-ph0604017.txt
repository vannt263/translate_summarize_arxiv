    "more than 20 years ago , hong , ou , and mandel showed experimentally that mutually strongly quantum correlated ( entangled ) photon pairs can be emitted in the nonlinear process of parametric down - conversion @xcite at the single - photon level .",
    "for the occurrence of entangled photon pairs , the spontaneous character of the process is important .",
    "entanglement of two photons comprising a photon pair might occur for various physical quantities like frequencies , emission angles ( wave - vectors ) , or polarizations .",
    "perhaps most interestingly , entangled photon pairs manifest themselves in time domain , where both photons are detected within a relatively narrow time window .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the ` point ' character of the emission of a photon pair in the time domain .",
    "the width of the time window characterized by an entanglement time is typically on the order of several hundreds of fs , and is experimentally observable using hong - ou - mandel interferometer .    in the time that has intervened since the original predictions , entangled photon pairs",
    "have been used for numerous experiments demonstrating both fundamental aspects of their physical properties @xcite and their potential for applications .",
    "these also include tests of bell inequalities @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , the generation of greenberger - horne - zeilinger states @xcite or quantum computation @xcite that can exploit photon pairs . quantum cryptography with photon pairs @xcite",
    "may be considered the most important application .",
    "we mention that applications to metrology have also been suggested @xcite .",
    "most researchers in the field have focused their attention for the most part on bulk nonlinear crystals , pumped by intense laser beams in type i and type ii configurations .",
    "bright sources of polarization - entangled photon pairs have been fabricated using two nonlinear type i crystals , mutually rotated by 90 degrees @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear processes in an optical cavity have also been used to enhance the photon - pair generation rate @xcite .",
    "in addition , periodically - poled materials may be used to increase the photon - pair generation rate in materials where phase matching is not naturally available @xcite . at present ,",
    "even sources of photon pairs pumped by laser diodes have been developed @xcite .",
    "on the fabrication front , techniques of structures composed of nonlinear thin layers ( of width of several tens or hundreds of nm ) have developed to the point that useful structures with pre - defined properties may be achieved rather easily @xcite .",
    "these nonlinear photonic - band - gap structures @xcite are very promising as sources of photon pairs , as has recently been shown in @xcite . despite the small amount of nonlinear material embedded inside them",
    ", they can generate photon pairs with relatively high efficiency thanks to the constructive interference that involves both the pump and the down - converted fields , their spatial inhomogeneity nothwithstanding .",
    "the enhancement of the photon - pair generation rate has been predicted to be several hundreds and even thousands of times larger than photon - pair generation rates in nonlinear , bulk materials @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spectral and spatial characteristics of the down - converted fields depend on details of the structure , a fact that might be used to control the process , at least to some extent . for example",
    ", photon pairs with very narrow spectra may be obtained from suitable structures .",
    "we note that along the same vein , four - wave mixing in photonic - band - gap nonlinear fibers is also promising as a modern source of photon pairs @xcite .    in this paper , we present a quantum model of photon - pair emission in a nonlinear , one - dimensional photonic - band - gap structure , based upon a perturbative solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "this model extends those developed for bulk nonlinear materials in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this approach is compatible with models based on methods of classical nonlinear optics ( multiple - scale spatial and temporal expansion methods ) with a specific kind of stochastic averaging concerning emitted spectra . the quantum model , however , provides a complete description of the nonlinear process .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec",
