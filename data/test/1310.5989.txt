    "in recent years there has been a lot of interest in the field of plasmonics which seems to be the only viable path towards realization of nanophotonics : control of light at scales substantially smaller than the wavelength @xcite .",
    "however , plasmonic materials ( most notably metals ) suffer from large losses in the frequency regimes of interest , which resulted in a wide search for better materials @xcite .",
    "lots of attention has recently been given to plasmonics in graphene @xcite , which is a single two - dimensional ( 2d ) plane of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "one exciting point of interest of 2d materials is that they are tunable .",
    "for example , graphene can be doped to high values of electron or hole concentrations by applying gate voltage @xcite , much like in field effect transistors . furthermore",
    ", graphene can be be produced in very clean samples with large mobilities ( demonstrated by dc transport measurements ) @xcite .",
    "the dc scattering rates would imply small plasmon losses in graphene , however , it is still not clear how the scattering rates change with frequency , particularly in the infrared ( ir ) region .",
    "recent nano - imaging measurements @xcite have demonstrated somewhat increased plasmon losses at ir compared to the estimate based on dc transport measurements .",
    "measurements of optical transmission through graphene nano - ribbons @xcite have demonstrated strong increase of plasmon linewidth with frequency and losses that are much larger than the dc estimates .",
    "however , since the ribbon width in these experiments is very small ( 10 - 100 nm ) edge scattering can significantly increase the losses . nevertheless , a similar experiment @xcite with graphene nano - rings has demonstrated plasmon linewidths that approximately agree with the dc estimate .",
    "finally electron energy loss experiments ( eels ) @xcite on graphene sheets have demonstrated huge plasmon linewidths that increase linearly with plasmon momentum ; however , the ( dc ) transport measurements were not reported so it is not clear what was the actual quality of the graphene films .",
    "it is also interesting to note that similar results @xcite were obtained with eels on the mono - atomic silver film which could imply a common origin of plasmon damping in these two 2d systems . on one hand",
    ", metallic monolayers might be even more interesting from the point of view of plasmonics since they have abundance of free electrons even in the intrinsic case , while graphene has to be doped with electrons since it is a zero band gap semiconductor .",
    "on the other hand , graphene has superior mechanical properties and was demonstrated in a free standing ( suspended ) samples while metallic monolayers have only been observed on a substrate .",
    "instead of calculating plasmon linewidth , we will focus on a directly related problem of optical absorption , which is easier to analyze . in that respect ,",
    "it was shown experimentally @xcite that suspended graphene absorbs around 2.3@xmath0 of normal incident light in a broad range of frequencies . however",
    ", if graphene is doped with electrons , then pauli principle blocks some of these transitions and there should be a sudden decrease of absorption below a certain threshold , which should theoretically occur at twice the fermi energy .",
    "nevertheless , optical spectroscopy experiments @xcite have shown that there is still lots of absorption even below this threshold .",
    "this absorption is much larger than the estimate based on dc measurements .",
    "a great deal of theoretical work addressed this problem @xcite , but to our knowledge , the experimental results have quantitatively not been explained yet .    in this paper , we focus on optical absorption mediated by charged impurity scattering .",
    "as we have already stated , the motivation for studying this problem follows from the fact that typical graphene samples can have large mobilities ( @xmath1 @xmath2vs ) in spite of a huge concentration of charged impurities @xcite ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) , which is actually comparable to the typical concentration of electrons .",
    "the reason one can have such a large mobility is screening @xcite . in fact , if one assumes that electrons scatter from bare charged impurities described with the coulomb potential @xmath5 , then the resulting mobility is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the measured value @xcite . the only way to reconcile",
    "the experiment and theory is to say that the actual scattering potential is screened to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the static dielectric function .",
    "however , in the dynamical case , at finite frequency , screening is not so effective and @xmath7 should be replaced with the dynamic dielectric function @xmath8 .",
    "this will certainly influence the single particle excitations where an incident photon excites an electron hole pair through impurity scattering .",
    "moreover , at finite frequency one can have @xmath9 ( at the plasmon dispersion ) so there exists an additional decay channel where an incident photon excites a plasmon of the same energy , through impurity scattering .",
    "in other words , impurities break the translational symmetry ( momentum does not need to be conserved ) , which allows the photon to couple directly to a plasmon mode . very recently",
    "another group also calculated this process in graphene but only in the small frequency limit @xcite . here",
    "we give the result for the arbitrary frequency ( both for metallic monolayers and graphene ) which can be very different from the small frequency limit .",
    "more specifically , we calculate the optical absorption in the 2d electron systems with the randomly arranged charged impurities . first , we discuss the case of metallic monolayers which have a parabolic electron dispersion , and then the case of graphene with dirac electron dispersion .",
    "we focus on a decay channel where the incident photon emits a plasmon through impurity scattering , but we also discuss a case where the incident photon emits the plasmon and a surface optical phonon of the substrate . for graphene on @xmath10 substrate ,",
    "the resulting optical absorption is very small compared to the experimental results @xcite , and not enough to reconcile the difference between the theory @xcite and the experiment@xcite . on the other hand we predict large optical absorption by plasmon emission via impurity scattering in suspended graphene .",
    "thus we believe that these ideas can be tested in suspended graphene .",
    "finally we note that for suspended graphene ( metallic monolayers ) the small frequency limit @xcite gives an order of magnitude lower ( larger ) result than the more exact rpa calculation .",
    "the case of the optical absorption in a bulk 3d system with parabolic electron dispersion and randomly arranged impurities was already studied by hopfield @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to extend his result to a 2d system and here we provide only a brief description of the calculation .",
    "we study a system described by the hamiltonian @xmath11 , where @xmath12 represents kinetic energy of free electrons , @xmath13 describes electron - electron interaction which is conveniently represented through the screening effect , @xmath14 describes scattering with light , and @xmath15 scattering with impurities .",
    "electrons in a metallic monolayer can be described with a parabolic dispersion : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the electron momentum , and @xmath18 is effective mass of the electron .",
    "next , let us introduce a monochromatic light beam of frequency @xmath19 which is described by the electric field @xmath20 .",
    "this wave is incident normally on a 2d electron gas , that is @xmath21 is in the plane of the gas .",
    "if we are only interested in a linear response with respect to this electric field , then interaction of electrons with light takes a particularly simple expression : @xmath22 , where we have introduced electron charge ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "further on , since momentum is a good quantum number even in an interacting electron system , light scattering ( @xmath14 ) will not change the many - body eigenstates of @xmath24 , but only the eigenvalues , see ref . @xcite .",
    "then , one only needs to do the perturbation theory in the impurity scattering . unfortunately this trick ( due to hopfield )",
    "works only in the systems with parabolic electron dispersion , while in the case of dirac electrons , like those found in graphene , one needs to do the perturbation theory both in the light scattering and in the impurity scattering , which is a much more tedious task .",
    "we can write the hamiltonian for impurity scattering as a fourier sum over wavevectors @xmath25 : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the total area of our 2d system . by calculating the induced current to the second order in @xmath28 one can find the real part of conductivity @xcite : @xmath29 note that this quantity ( @xmath30 ) determines the optical absorption in our system . here",
    "@xmath8 stands for a dielectric function of the electron gas and @xmath31 is the fourier transform of the coulomb potential between two electrons in 2d layer embedded between two dielectrics of average relative permitivity @xmath32 .",
    "we have assumed without loss of generality that the external field points in the @xmath33 direction ( @xmath34 ) and is parallel to the plane of our 2d electron gas .    in the case of randomly assembled impurities at positions @xmath35 , one can write for the scattering potential @xmath36 .",
    "note that we are assuming positively charged ( @xmath37 ) impurities embedded in a see of negative electrons ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "then by averaging over random impurity positions one has @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of impurities @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ absorp2d ] ) depends on the loss function @xmath40 which generally contains contribution from single particle excitations and collective ( plasmon ) excitations . in this paper",
    "we focus solely on the plasmon contribution in which case one can write @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the plasmon frequency determined by the zero of the dielectric function : @xmath43 .",
    "this term then represents the process where an incident photon excites plasmon of the same energy , through impurity scattering .",
    "the @xmath44-function from equation ( [ lossf_plasmon_omega ] ) extracts only a single wavevector from the sum in equation ( [ absorp2d ] ) , which corresponds to the plasmon wavevector at the given frequency @xmath19 .",
    "then one is left with integration over the angle @xmath45 which is straightforward to perform since @xmath46 .",
    "finally , we plot the conductivity from expression ( [ absorp2d ] ) in figure [ fig1 ] by using the dielectric function @xmath8 within random phase approximation ( rpa ) given in ref .",
    "@xcite . to represent the experiment @xcite , which studied silver monolayer on a silicon substrate",
    ", we choose @xmath47 , @xmath48 , the effective mass @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the free electron mass , electron concentration @xmath51 @xmath4 , and we assume the impurity concentration @xmath52 @xmath4 .",
    "it is also convenient to look at the small frequency limit @xmath53 in which case only long wavelength @xmath54 plasmons contribute to the scattering . here",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 stand for fermi energy and fermi momentum , respectively . in this limit",
    ", one can use a simple drude model to obtain the dielectric function : @xmath57 in this case , plasmon dispersion is simply @xmath58 and one can easily evaluate equations ( [ absorp2d ] ) and ( [ lossf_plasmon_omega ] ) to obtain the conductivity : @xmath59 here we have introduced the thomas - fermi wavevector : @xmath60 , while @xmath61 stands for the impurity density . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] b we see that in the case of metallic monolayers the small frequency limit ( dashed line ) significantly overestimates the more exact rpa result ( solid line ) .",
    "unfortunately , the trick that hopfield used in the case of the parabolic dispersion does not work for dirac dispersion so one has to do the perturbation theory both in impurity scattering and in light scattering , while including the screening effect in every order of the perturbation theory .",
    "this is straightforward , but very tedious task , so we give the derivation of the optical absorption in the appendix .",
    "here we only write the final result : @xmath62 where we have assumed general impurity scattering hamiltonian : @xmath63 ( see the appendix for more details ) . in the case of charged impurities one has @xmath38 after averaging over random impurity positions .",
    "then , to find the contribution of plasmon emission process one can use equation ( [ lossf_plasmon_omega ] ) and the dielectric function which is calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite within the rpa . the resulting optical absorption ,",
    "is plotted in figure [ fig2 ] . to resemble parameters from the experiment @xcite we choose electron concentration @xmath64 @xmath4 , and impurity concentration @xmath52 @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , we plot the case of graphene sitting on the @xmath10 substrate where @xmath65 , but also the case of suspended graphene where @xmath66 .",
    "it is also convenient to look at the small frequency limit @xmath53 in which case only long wavelength @xmath54 plasmons contribute to the scattering .",
    "then , one can use a simple drude model to obtain the dielectric function in graphene @xcite : @xmath67 in this case the function @xmath68 takes a particularly simple expression ( see the appendix for more details ) : @xmath69 , and it is straightforward to evaluate expression ( [ absorp_graphene ] ) to obtain : @xmath70 note that this is the same result as in the case of metallic monolayers .",
    "this is expected because in the small frequency ( long wavelength ) limit , one does not expect to see specific details of the band structure . of course , in the graphene case , the thomas - fermi wavevector is given by a different expression : @xmath71 .",
    "we would like to note that the small frequency limit in the case of graphene was also recently obtained by another group @xcite .",
    "however , from figure [ fig3 ] one can see that the small frequency limit can be very different from the more general rpa result .",
    "if we now compare our results [ figure [ fig2 ] ( b ) ] with experiment @xcite , we see that this effect of plasmon emission is relatively small ( @xmath72 ) compared to the experimental results ( @xmath73 ) in this regime .",
    "one might ask what are the other potentially strong scattering mechanisms ?",
    "for example in experiment @xcite , graphene is sitting on @xmath10 , which is a polar substrate , so there is a strong interaction of electrons with the surface polar phonons at energy @xmath74 ev .",
    "this is described by the hamiltonian @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the phonon creation operator . for the square of the scattering potential we can write @xcite : @xmath77 .",
    "we use parameters from ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath78 scattering : @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and we assume that the van der waals distance between graphene and the substrate is @xmath81 nm . if we neglect the frequency dependence of @xmath82 , one can make an estimate of absorption simply by replacing @xmath83 with @xmath84 in relation ( [ absorp_graphene ] ) .",
    "strictly speaking this is valid only at large frequencies when @xmath85 , but it should give a reasonable estimate in the regime @xmath86 which is the relevant regime in experiment @xcite .",
    "the resulting absorption is still extremely small ( @xmath87 ) in the regime of interest ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "even though our analysis suggests that these loss mechanisms can not be distinguished from other loss mechanisms in current experiments involving graphene on a @xmath10 substrate , our calculations point out that they should be observable in suspended graphene ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "suspended graphene is a much cleaner system as one can eliminate all the scattering mechanisms that originate from the interaction with the substrate .",
    "moreover , in optical transmission measurements on suspended graphene ( sketched in figure [ fig3 ] ( c ) ) one does not need to consider optical absorption of the substrate .",
    "suspended graphene can be doped by depositing electron - donor atoms like sodium or lithium . in that case one",
    "is left with impurity ions with the same number as the number of injected electrons . in figure [ fig3 ] ( b )",
    "we plot optical absorption in suspended graphene for identical impurity and electron concentrations @xmath89 @xmath4 .",
    "one can see that there is a huge optical absorption through the plasmon emission channel as the real part of conductivity reaches @xmath73 .",
    "this would correspond to the @xmath90 reduction in the intensity of transmitted light , which could easily be observed as the @xmath91 reduction is already visible by naked eye @xcite .",
    "finally we note that the small frequency limit ( equation ( [ absorp2d_drude_graphene ] ) ) underestimates the more exact rpa calculation ( equation ( [ absorp_graphene ] ) ) by an order of magnitude .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied optical absorption of 2d electron gas in graphene and metallic monolayers with random distribution of charge impurities .",
    "this formalism can also treat other 2d electron systems like those found in heterostructures , single layer boron - nitride , or single layer molybdenum - disulphide where we expect similar behavior .",
    "specifically , we have focused on a decay channel where an incident photon excites a plasmon through impurity scattering . for the graphene sitting on a @xmath10 substrate ,",
    "we have also studied a decay channel where an incident photon excites a plasmon and an optical phonon of the polar substrate . the resulting optical absorption is more than one order of magnitude lower than the experimental results @xcite , and not enough to reconcile the difference between the theory @xcite and the experiment @xcite . on the other hand",
    "we predict large optical absorption by plasmon emission via impurity scattering in suspended graphene .",
    "thus we believe that these ideas can be tested in suspended graphene .",
    "finally we note that for suspended graphene ( metallic monolayers ) the small frequency limit @xcite gives an order of magnitude lower ( larger ) result than the more exact rpa calculation .",
    "we use single particle density matrix ( spdm ) approach which is a convenient way to take into account both temperature and the pauli principle .",
    "equation of motion for spdm @xmath92 is given by @xcite : @xmath93 , \\label{eq_of_motion}\\ ] ] where the hamiltonian is given by @xmath94 here @xmath12 represents kinetic energy of free electrons , @xmath14 describes scattering with light , @xmath15 scattering with impurities , and @xmath95 describes electron - electron interactions which we only take in the form of a self - consistent screening field . in the case of graphene , electrons are described by dirac dispersion @xcite : @xmath96 where @xmath97 m / s is fermi velocity , @xmath98 is electron wavevector , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 are the pauli spin matrices . let us denote by @xmath101 eigenstates of @xmath12 , where @xmath102 stands for the conduction band , and @xmath103 for the valence band .",
    "then the eigenvalues of @xmath12 are given by dirac cones : @xmath104 .",
    "if we now introduce a light source described by the electric field @xmath105 , then scattering with light is determined by the hamiltonian : @xmath106 where @xmath23 is the electron charge .",

    "we assume a general scattering potential and only later we will specify @xmath83 for the case of charged impurity scattering and surface polar phonon scattering .",
    "finally , one can also write the screening field as a fourier sum : @xmath109 but one has to keep in mind that different orders of the perturbation expansion will have different time dependence ( frequencies ) . here",
    ", the screening field is taken as a self - consistent electrostatic field that the electrons induce on themselves , so one can write @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the fourier transform of the electron density , and @xmath112 is the fourier transform of the coulomb potential between two electrons . for a 2d electron gas embedded between two dielectrics of relative permitivity @xmath32 , one can write : @xmath113 .",
    "note that this is valid only in the electrostatic limit @xmath114 which is the relevant regime for our case .",

    "we are now interested in calculating the current response up to the linear order in the external electric field @xmath21 . since the electric field is uniform in the graphene plane , we are only interested in the @xmath117 term , and the current density operator is given by @xmath118 .",
    "the induced current will have only the @xmath33 component , since the electric field points in the @xmath33 direction .",
    "finally , the induced current density is given by @xmath119 , so we can write : @xmath120 to include also impurity scattering , we need to calculate the induced current up to the second order in @xmath28 . in other words we need to do a perturbation expansion of spdm : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the equilibrium solution to equation ( [ eq_of_motion ] ) for independent dirac electrons in the absence of impurity scattering and light scattering , @xmath123 is solution of equation ( [ eq_of_motion ] ) correct up to a linear order in light scattering , @xmath124 is solution up to the linear order in impurity scattering , @xmath125 is solution up to linear order both in light scattering and impurity scattering , and @xmath126 is solution up to the linear order in light scattering and quadratic in impurity scattering . using equation ( [ eq_of_motion ] ) , we can now write the equation of motion for every order of spdm expansion : @xmath127 , \\label{eq_of_motion_0}\\ ] ] @xmath128 + \\left [ h_l+h_l^s,\\rho_0 \\right ] , \\label{eq_of_motion_l}\\ ] ] @xmath129+\\left [ h_i+h_i^s,\\rho_0 \\right ] , \\label{eq_of_motion_i}\\ ] ] @xmath130 + \\left [ h_i+h_i^s,\\rho_l \\right]+ \\left [ h_l+h_l^s,\\rho_i \\right]+ \\left [ h_{li}^s,\\rho_0 \\right ] , \\ ; \\mbox{and } \\label{eq_of_motion_li}\\ ] ] @xmath131 + \\left [ h_i+h_i^s,\\rho_{li } \\right]+ \\left [ h_{li}^s,\\rho_i \\right]+ \\left [ h_{lii}^s,\\rho_0 \\right ] .",

    "<S> screening is one of the fundamental concepts in solid state physics . </S>",
    "<S> it has a great impact on the electronic properties of graphene where huge mobilities were observed in spite of the large concentration of charged impurities . </S>",
    "<S> while static screening has successfully explained dc mobilities , screening properties can be significantly changed at infrared or optical frequencies . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the influence of dynamical screening on the optical absorption of graphene and other 2d electron systems like metallic monolayers . </S>",
    "<S> this research is motivated by recent experimental results which pointed out that graphene plasmon linewidths and optical scattering rates can be much larger than scattering rates determined by dc mobilities . </S>",
    "<S> specifically we discuss a process where a photon incident on a graphene plane can excite a plasmon by scattering from an impurity , or surface optical phonon of the substrate . </S>"
