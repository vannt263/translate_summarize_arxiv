    "7 . by comparing figs .  6 and 7",
    ", we note that fermi - lat data gives more stringent constraint on @xmath155 mode than its constraint on @xmath10 mode .",
    "this is in contrast to the deepcore case as one can see from fig .  2 .",
    "while the neutrino spectrum through @xmath10 is harder than that through @xmath155 , the gamma ray spectra through the above annihilations behave differently .",
    "the gamma ray spectrum from @xmath155 dominates over that from @xmath10 for most of the range of @xmath189  @xcite . the expected @xmath132 sensitivity on @xmath155 channel by the deepcore detector with @xmath158",
    "is also shown in fig .",
    "one can see that the expected deepcore sensitivity on this channel is weaker than all existing constraints presented here .     and @xmath190 channels due to fermi observations for the region @xmath175 plus a @xmath176 at gc , assuming the nfw profile  @xcite .",
    "the solid line and dotted line are our expected @xmath132 sensitivities for @xmath191 and @xmath190 channels with @xmath181 and @xmath137 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=85.0% ] 0.5 cm    in addition to studying deepcore sensitivities on dm annihilation channels , we also study sensitivities on dm decay time for @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath130 channels .",
    "figure  8 shows the required dm decay time for reaching @xmath132 detection significance in five years on cascade events from each channel with the threshold energy @xmath181 and a cone half - angle @xmath137 .",
    "non - detection of such a signature would then exclude the parameter region below the curve at the @xmath132 level .",
    "we shall see later that the deepcore sensitivity to dm decay time is not improved by considering @xmath159 smaller than @xmath162 . comparing various dm decay modes , one can see that @xmath186 channel requires the lowest decay rate ( longest decay time ) to avoid a @xmath132 detection significance in five years of deepcore data taking .",
    "we note that the energy - dependent effective volume @xmath140  @xcite downgrades the sensitivity to @xmath192 decay time by roughly a factor of 1.5 at @xmath193 gev , which corresponds to @xmath194 gev .",
    "however , the sensitivity to @xmath192 obtained with @xmath140 is better than that presented in fig .  8 for @xmath195 gev , which corresponds to @xmath196 gev . for @xmath191 mode ,",
    "the sensitivity at @xmath193 gev is lower by a factor of @xmath197 by applying @xmath140 , since such a @xmath26 corresponds to lowest possible neutrino energy @xmath142 gev .",
    "however , @xmath140 shall enhance the sensitivity for @xmath198 gev , which corresponds to @xmath199 gev , assuming @xmath200 .",
    "the correction factor for @xmath201 is similar to that for @xmath191 , while the hadronic mode @xmath190 requires different correction factor for the same @xmath26 .",
    "once more , we do not address such a correction as the deepcore detector is relatively insensitive to @xmath190 .",
    "next , we show how the deepcore sensitivity on dm decay time varies with the chosen cone half - angle and threshold energy .",
    "we use @xmath191 channel to illustrate these effects . in fig .  9 , we present the required dm decay time @xmath202 as a function of @xmath26 for reaching @xmath132 detection significance in five years for different cone half - angle @xmath159 .",
    "the sensitivity curve rises as @xmath159 increases from @xmath160 to @xmath162 . as @xmath159 increases in this cone half - angle range , the dm event rate increases faster than that of atmospheric background .",
    "however , the sensitivity is not further improved by increasing @xmath159 from @xmath162 to @xmath203 .",
    "we also show the required dm decay time for a @xmath132 detection significance in five years with @xmath204 and @xmath205 for comparison .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath205 gives rise to the highest sensitivity on dm decay time for @xmath170 .",
    "we note that the sensitivity on dm decay time is improved by lowering @xmath166 from @xmath167 gev to @xmath168 gev for @xmath206 gev .",
    "it is of interest to compare sensitivities on dm decay time given by cascade events and track events . in fig .",
    "10 , one can see that cascade events provide better sensitivity on dm decay time than that given by track events for the same threshold energy @xmath207 and @xmath159 . in the same figure",
    "we also show the sensitivity given by track events for @xmath208 .",
    "such a @xmath209 renders the best sensitivity for track events .",
    "however this sensitivity is still poorer than those given by cascade events .    in fig .  11 , we present decay time lower limits for @xmath191 and @xmath190 channels obtained from the diffuse gamma - ray spectrum for the region @xmath175 plus a @xmath176 square region centered at gc , assuming the nfw profile .",
    "they are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , with a rescaling factor @xmath210 applied since we have adopted a local density of @xmath25 while fermi - lat analysis uses @xmath180 . in the same figure , we also show the expected @xmath132 sensitivities to @xmath191 and @xmath190 decay time by the deepcore detector with @xmath137 for comparisons . for the deepcore detector ,",
    "the sensitivity to the @xmath191 decay time is better than that to the @xmath190 decay time , since the neutrino spectrum in the former channel is harder than the one in the latter channel . on the other hand , the fermi - lat data in general gives more stringent constraint on @xmath190 decay time than its constraint on the decay time of @xmath191 .",
    "this is because that the gamma ray spectrum from the former channel dominates over the one from the latter channel for most of the range of @xmath189 , as the dm annihilation case .",
    "if dm decays predominantly into @xmath1 , one can see that the decay time sensitivity expected at deepcore is comparable to the constraint given by fermi - lat data .",
    "this conclusion is not altered by adopting the energy - dependent effective volume @xmath140  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if dm decays predominantly to @xmath211 , the expected deepcore sensitivity is much poorer than the constraint from fermi - lat data .",
    "in this paper , we have evaluated sensitivities of icecube deepcore detector to neutrino cascade events induced by dm annihilations and decays in galactic halo .",
    "we focus on the scenario of small dm mass and the threshold energy for the cascade events is taken to be @xmath168 gev .",
    "the event rate of background atmospheric neutrinos is calculated with @xmath212 oscillations taken into account for neutrino energies less than @xmath213 gev .",
    "the signal event rate is calculated by taking nfw profile for dm density distribution in the galactic halo . among all dm annihilation and decay channels ,",
    "the annihilation mode @xmath7 and the decay mode @xmath192 provide the best search sensitivity , while the search sensitivity provided by the annihilation mode @xmath155 and the decay mode @xmath214 is the poorest .",
    "it is important to compare the expected sensitivities of deepcore detector to dm annihilation cross section and decay time with the existing constraints on the same quantities obtained by cosmology and fermi - lat gamma - ray observations .",
    "it is seen that the fermi - lat constraints on @xmath155 and @xmath214 are much stronger than the expected deepcore sensitivities to the same channels .",
    "hence , if dm predominantly annihilates or decays into @xmath211 , the deepcore detector is not expected to observe neutrino signature induced by dm in the galactic halo . for leptonic final states , one can see from fig . 6",
    "that the expected deepcore sensitivity to @xmath10 annihilation cross section is stronger than the fermi - lat constraint on the same channel based upon gamma - ray data from the galactic halo .",
    "however , the former sensitivity with the current angular resolution of cascade events is slightly weaker than both the dsphs constraint and the constraint obtained from wmap and act results on cmb anisotropy . on the other hand ,",
    "the deepcore sensitivity can be improved with an improved angular resolution for cascade events . in fig .",
    "11 , we also see that the expected deepcore sensitivity to @xmath191 decay time is comparable to the fermi - lat constraint based upon gamma - ray data from the galactic halo . from the above comparisons ,",
    "there remain slight possibilities to observe dm induced neutrino signature from the galactic halo provided dm annihilates or decays predominantly into leptons .",
    "it should be noted that fermi - lat and cmb data does not directly set limits on @xmath7 or @xmath192 modes with monochromatic neutrinos . there",
    "exist models @xcite in which @xmath7 and @xmath192 are dominant annihilation and decay modes , respectively . in the annihilation case",
    "@xcite for example , the dm candidate can be the lightest right - handed ( rh ) sneutrino in a @xmath215 extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "rh sneutrinos annihilate into a pair of rh neutrinos .",
    "each of these rh neutrinos then decays into ordinary left - handed ( lh ) neutrino and a neutral higgs boson while the decay of rh neutrino into charged final states @xmath216 is typically forbidden in such a model . in the case",
    "that the mass difference between rh sneutrinos and rh neutrinos is small , rh neutrinos are produced non - relativistically by dm annihilations .",
    "hence lh neutrinos produced by the decays of rh neutrinos are approximately monochromatic with an energy around half of the dm mass . therefore the sensitivity of icecube deepcore to this type of models",
    "can be read off from the @xmath7 curve in fig .",
    "2 with the shift @xmath217 .    before closing ,",
    "we comment on the detection of neutrino signature induced by dm in the galactic halo with neutrino telescopes in the northern hemisphere .",
    "generally a neutrino telescope in such a location has advantages in detecting track - like neutrino events .",
    "first , the telescope s effective volume for upward going track events is enhanced by the muon range .",
    "this effect is particularly significant for energetic track events originated from high - energy muon neutrinos .",
    "second , a neutrino telescope in the northern hemisphere naturally suppresses atmospheric muon background while icecube needs to use optical modules located at the outer region for vetoing the same background  @xcite .",
    "following these arguments , it is interesting to see if a detector array in the northern hemisphere with the size of deepcore detector has a significantly better sensitivity than the current deepcore detector surrounded by icecube strings .",
    "since the latter also has a good veto capability , the former can gain only in the effective volume expected to be enhanced by the muon range .",
    "we note that the deepcore array aims at detecting neutrinos in the energy range @xmath218 .",
    "muons induced by muon neutrinos in this energy range only travel around @xmath167 m for @xmath219 gev and @xmath220 m for @xmath221 gev .",
    "this does not significantly enhance the detector s effective volume in most cases since the height of the deepcore detector is already around @xmath222 m. therefore , given the existence of icecube detector augmented by deepcore in the south pole , it is clear that neutrino telescopes in the northern hemisphere only have advantages in detecting neutrino signature from heavier dm . in this regard , the acceptance for track events in km3net as a function of neutrino",
    "energy has been estimated @xcite . with this acceptance",
    ", we also calculate the sensitivity of km3net to dm annihilation cross section @xmath149 in the galactic halo . for @xmath223 and @xmath224 gev ,",
    "the km3net @xmath132 sensitivity to @xmath149 in 5 years is comparable to the cmb constraint on this channel  @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath8 tev , cmb constraint gives @xmath149 no greater than @xmath9 @xmath5s@xmath6 whereas the km3net @xmath132 sensitivity on the same annihilation channel can reach to @xmath225@xmath5s@xmath6 in 5 years .    in conclusion",
    ", we have made detailed comparisons between icecube deepcore sensitivities and other existing constraints on various dm annihilation and decay channels .",
    "the prospect for deepcore detector to observe neutrino signature induced by dm in the galactic halo has been discussed .",
    "we have also mentioned the expected performance of km3net on this observation .",

    "<S> we discuss the event rate in deepcore array due to neutrino flux produced by annihilations and decays of galactic dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> this event rate is calculated with a 10 gev threshold energy , which is smaller than the threshold energy taken in previous works . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the background event rate due to the atmospheric neutrino flux , we evaluate the sensitivity of deepcore array for probing dark matter annihilation cross section and decay time . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity studies include the annihilation modes @xmath0 ,  @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , and decay modes @xmath3 ,  @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with corresponding constraints derived from observations of wmap , act and fermi - lat .    </S>",
