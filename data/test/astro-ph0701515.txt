    "here we also notice that if we reduce the agn duty - cycle just to the visible optical phase , i.e. substituting @xmath231 with @xmath315 in equation  ( [ eq|modellf ] ) , the match between models and the type i agn lf derived in section  [ sec|typeilf ] , would yield similar results on the type of @xmath237 relation .",

    "<S> using the results of recent optical surveys we conclude that the _ non_-detection of quasars down to faint magnitudes implies a significant flattening of the high redshift ( @xmath0 ) optical active galactic nuclei ( agn ) luminosity function for @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all the data are consistent with a faint - end slope for the optical agn luminosity function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , at the 90% and 99% confidence level respectively , flatter than the bright - end slope of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that x - ray deep surveys have probed even fainter magnitudes than the optical ones yielding more significant constraints on the shallow faint - end slope of the optical luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of type ii agn candidates , detected in the _ chandra _ deep fields , hints towards an higher normalization for the total agn luminosity function , if these sources lie at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss simple theoretical models of agn formation and evolution in the context of cold dark matter cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with the total agn luminosity function favors a redshift - dependent relation between black hole and dark matter halo masses of the type @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , compatible with independent studies from statistical analysis and rotation curve measurements . </S>",
    "<S> finally we compute the quasar contribution to reionization to be @xmath8 at @xmath0 , up to @xmath9 when integrated within @xmath10 , significantly smaller than that from galaxies . </S>"
