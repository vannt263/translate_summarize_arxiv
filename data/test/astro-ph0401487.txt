    "since the discovery of 51 peg b ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) , over a hundred gaseous planets have been discovered in orbit around g , k , and m stars .",
    "these discoveries have opened a new domain of research in astronomy , at the crossroad between stellar and planetary physics .",
    "many ground - based and space - based missions are planned for the coming years to search for more of these objects , and the next decade will probably see the first direct detection of an extrasolar planet .",
    "these projects require a robust theoretical background to accurately understand the properties of these objects and to provide reliable guidance for observations .",
    "the vast majority of these planets have a projected mass , @xmath4 , of about one jupiter mass ( @xmath5 ) but are found to orbit much closer to their parent star than jupiter , with a pile - up around @xmath6 au . as such",
    ", these planets experience strong irradiation from their parent star .",
    "observations of objects that transit their parent star provide information crucial to understanding these so - called hot - jupiters .",
    "the transit light curve or photometry , supplemented by radial velocity measurements of the star , yields the absolute mass and average radius of the planet . together with an estimate of the age of the parent star from stellar evolution models , the radius and mass provide stringent constraints on the evolution of the internal and atmospheric properties of strongly irradiated planets .",
    "the correct description of these properties has been questioned recently by the detection of the transit planet @xmath0 ( brown et al .",
    "no consistent model can adequately reproduce the observationally determined mass and radius of the planet ( @xmath7 ) ( cody & sasselov 2002 ) without stretching these determinations beyond their error bars ( guillot & showman 2002 , baraffe et al .",
    "2003 , burrows et al .",
    "this led to the suggestion that an important part of fundamental physics might be missing in the description of irradiated planets and has motivated several authors to propose possible shortcomings of the theory . in the present letter , the theory developed in baraffe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for non - irradiated and irradiated planets is applied to various cases of hot - jupiters , with special focus on the case of the second observed transit , @xmath1 .",
    "the theory adequately reproduces the observed radius of the planet , for the proper age of the system and the more recent mass determination ( torres et al .",
    "2003 ) . the comparison of the present predictions for the evolution of hot - jupiters with forthcoming transit detections will allow the unambiguous verification or rejection of the present theory",
    "for a planet in close orbit around its parent star , the strong incident stellar radiation substantially modifies not only the emergent spectrum but also the evolution of the irradiated planet , as shown initially by guillot et al .",
    "these effects are examined below .      under strong irradiation conditions",
    ", the solution of the transfer equation , which determines the atmospheric thermal structure of the planet , must include the incoming incident stellar flux in the source function .",
    "such calculations were first conducted for hot - jupiters by seager & sasselov ( 1998 ) , using a limited set of opacities , and have subsequently been improved by barman , allard & hauschildt ( 2001 ) and sudarsky , burrows & hubeny ( 2003 ) .",
    "figure [ f1.eps ] compares the thermal structures of irradiated and non - irradiated planets with surface gravity @xmath8 ( cgs units ) and intrinsic temperatures @xmath9 k and @xmath10 k , respectively , orbiting a g2 main sequence star at 0.023 au or 0.046 au .",
    "the atmosphere models were produced using the same cloud - free opacity setup described by allard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and barman , allard & hauschildt ( 2001 ) .",
    "as examined below , this @xmath11 sequence corresponds to an age sequence of @xmath123@xmath13 yr to @xmath129@xmath14 yr for @xmath1 .",
    "the irradiated thermal profile is shown to be strongly modified with respect to the non - irradiated one .",
    "as stressed in baraffe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the differences between irradiated and non - irradiated temperature profiles clearly demonstrate the necessity to do _",
    "consistent _ calculations that combine the irradiated atmosphere profile and interior profile . matching arbitrarily the inner profile to an atmospheric profile defined by the equilibrium temperature of the planet yields severely flawed results .    note that the present calculations assume that all the incident flux is concentrated on the day - side of the planet .",
    "such an assumption maximizes the effect of irradiation and might overestimate the flux deposit .",
    "the present nearly isothermal irradiated profiles , however , are consistent with the 2@xmath15 m observed spectrum of @xmath0 ( richardson , deming & seager 2003 ) .",
    "future calculations will include the latitude dependence of the incoming radiation but it is certainly interesting to verify whether the present calculations , with minimal assumptions , adequately reproduce the radius of new observed transiting planets .",
    "consistent evolution calculations of irradiated planets have been conducted only recently by baraffe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and burrows et al .",
    "the calculations presented here proceed as described in chabrier & baraffe ( 1997 ) for the non - irradiated case . a grid of irradiated atmospheric structures is computed for various @xmath16 conditions , for a given orbital distance @xmath17 , and interpolation between these structures yield the unique boundary condition with the internal structure , at large enough optical depth ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "as shown initially by guillot et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , irradiation pushes the radiative - convective boundary deeper into the interior and , under strong irradiation conditions , may force the boundary between the atmospheric and internal structure to lie in a radiative layer . to insure consistency between the atmosphere and internal thermal structures ,",
    "we have computed the rosseland mean of the atmospheric opacities and used this value to calculate the radiative gradient for the interior structure .",
    "the evolution of the planet obeys the usual first and second principles of thermodynamics .",
    "the energy balance , however , must include the incoming stellar radiative flux @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the parent star flux and radius , respectively .",
    "the total emergent flux of the planet @xmath22 now reads :    @xmath23    where @xmath11 denotes the intrinsic effective temperature of the planet , @xmath24 its bond albedo , and the first term on the r.h.s . of eqn.([evolir ] ) describes the reflected part of the spectrum .",
    "note that the albedo @xmath24 is not a free parameter in our calculations but is calculated consistently with the radiative transfer equation .",
    "for both transit cases , the models predict @xmath25 .",
    "the total luminosity thus reads :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 denotes the specific entropy of the planet . whereas the total flux @xmath28 or luminosity @xmath29 is the quantity accessible to observation , only the last term on the right hand side of eqn.([evolirrad ] ) concerns the evolution of the planet intrinsic luminosity @xmath30 . the first term , which defines the bond albedo , illustrates the fraction of the stellar luminosity reflected by the planet atmosphere .",
    "the second term defines its equilibrium temperature , i.e. the temperature the planet would reach in the absence of any internal source of energy ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "figure [ f2.eps ] compares the emergent flux calculated for @xmath1 and @xmath0 at their present ages . in both cases ,",
    "the infrared part of the spectrum ( @xmath32 m ) is dominated by the re - radiation of the absorbed incident stellar flux . indeed , under the conditions of interest",
    ", this contribution largely dominates the intrinsic contribution of the planet ( @xmath33 k @xmath34100 k for @xmath1 , and @xmath35 k @xmath34100 k for @xmath0 ) . for @xmath0 ,",
    "the short wavelength part of the spectrum ( @xmath36 m ) is mostly due to reflection of stellar light by h@xmath37 rayleigh scattering .",
    "however , in @xmath1 the high equilibrium temperature , @xmath38 k , leads to a lower concentration of h@xmath37 .",
    "consequently , reflection is less significant and the majority of the spectrum of @xmath1 is thermal radiation .",
    "figure [ f3.eps ] displays the evolution of the radius for different strongly irradiated planet conditions , with masses 0.69 @xmath39 and 1.5 @xmath39 , orbiting a g2 star ( @xmath40 k ) at different orbital distances , namely @xmath410.046 au and @xmath410.023 au . at a given orbital distance , the less massive the planet the larger the effect of irradiation .",
    "this was expected from figure [ f1.eps ] , showing the larger modification of the inner atmosphere profile with larger stellar / planet flux ratio . in all cases",
    ", however , irradiation substantially slows down the contraction of the planet , in particular at the early stages of evolution , when degeneracy effects in the interior are smaller . the case @xmath42 and @xmath410.023 au ( thick solid line ) corresponds to @xmath1 , for its recently revised mass , @xmath43 , and radius @xmath44 ( torres et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the age of the system was derived from the evolution of the parent star for its observed extinction - corrected magnitude and effective temperature ( sasselov 2003 ) .",
    "we derive @xmath45 , @xmath46 gyr to reproduce the observations , in excellent agreement with sasselov ( 2003 ) .",
    "the striking result is the very good agreement , within the error bar , between the present calculations and the observations .",
    "a prediction of the theory is that irradiation from a g2 star yields less than about @xmath47 increase of the planet radius after @xmath48 gyr , compared with the non - irradiated case , with all radii merging within the @xmath49 - 1.15 @xmath50 range at this stage . a key test for the theory",
    ", however , would be the observation of young @xmath51 yr ) transits , where radii of irradiated planets are predicted to vary rapidly with time and to depend substantially on the orbital distance .",
    "the case of @xmath0 thus becomes a puzzle .",
    "as discussed at length in baraffe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , no consistent evolution calculation can reproduce the observed radius .",
    "note that our calculations take into account the extension of the atmosphere , which we find to be of the order of @xmath52 ( at optical wavelengths ) for the age of this object .",
    "given the remaining uncertainties in the opacities of these planets , including for example non - equilibrium processes or day - night temperature gradients , we can not exclude larger extensions .",
    "it is very unlikely , however , that different opacities modify the internal adiabat strongly enough to increase the planet radius by 30% and thus solve the aforementioned discrepancy between theory and observation for @xmath0 .",
    "such a modification requires a drastic change of the energy deposited at the top of the internal adiabat , which essentially determines the radius ( baraffe et al .",
    "2003 , guillot & showman 2002 ) .",
    "molecular absorption , however , will prevent incident photons from penetrating that deep ( @xmath53 k near the top of the internal adiabat , see figure [ f1.eps ] ) . as discussed in  4.3 of baraffe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , dynamical processes such as tidal dissipation or synchronization are unlikely to provide the extra source of energy , for these timescales are at most of the order of @xmath54 yr . an interesting alternative scenario involves the inner redistribution of large scale atmospheric kinetic energy ( winds ) generated by the incident irradiation ( guillot & showman 2002 , showman & guillot 2002 ) . besides arbitrarily modifying the atmosphere - interior boundary condition , however , these calculations face a similar issue as mentioned above , namely about 1% of this kinetic energy must _ constantly _ be dissipated at the internal adiabat level , i.e. @xmath55 bar for @xmath0 ( see figure 5 of baraffe et al . 2003 ) and @xmath56 bar for @xmath1 ( see figure [ f1.eps ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to 18 and 23 pressure scale heights for these two planets , respectively .",
    "whether such a fraction of the surface flux of kinetic energy can be transported downward over so many scale heights and converted into thermal energy remains to be uniquely determined .    in order to test this scenario in the case of @xmath1 ,",
    "we have made evolution calculations where a fraction of the incident stellar flux is deposited deep enough in the planet to modify its internal adiabat ( see baraffe et al .",
    "figure [ f4.eps ] displays the evolution for the two transiting planets when a fraction @xmath57 of the incident flux over the day - side surface is deposited in the interior , with @xmath58 0.1% to 1 or 2% .",
    "these values correspond to about 40 to 400 times the planet s intrinsic energy flux for @xmath1 and up to about 2000 times for @xmath0 . as shown in the figure , _ if _ indeed @xmath1 is unambiguously confirmed as a transiting planet , values of @xmath59 larger than @xmath60 seem to be excluded , for they yield an interior entropy and radius that are too large . for @xmath0 , on the contrary , @xmath61 is about the minimum fraction needed to be consistent with the observational error bar . as shown earlier",
    ", however , the internal adiabat for the @xmath0 irradiation conditions lies at fewer pressure scale heights from the surface than for @xmath1 so that we expect intuitively a larger fraction of energy to be transported downward .",
    "although these conclusions must be considered with caution , they suggest that the dissipative process invoked by showman & guillot may indeed take place in hot - jupiters . a tiny ( @xmath62 ) fraction of the surface kinetic flux transported downward and converted into thermal energy at the planet s radiative - convective boundary is enough to modify significantly its internal adiabat and thus its contraction rate .",
    "the result would be a total @xmath63 - 30% increase of the radius , instead of the aforementioned @xmath64 increase due to bare insulation .",
    "another appealing alternative solution to the @xmath0 dilemma is the suggestion by bodenheimer , laughlin & lin ( 2003 ) of a second orbiting planet , forcing the finite eccentricity ( @xmath65 ) of @xmath0 .",
    "the constant tidal heating due to the orbit circularization could provide the required mysterious extra source of energy .",
    "this key issue will be nailed down in the near future with further observations of transits , as planned with the various ground - based ( stare , vulcan ) and spaced - based ( corot , mons , most ) missions .",
    "in this letter , we have extended the theory we derived recently for the evolution of @xmath0 to various conditions of so - called hot - jupiters , i.e. gaseous planets in close enough orbit around their parent star for the incoming stellar irradiation to affect substantially their structure and evolution . as argued previously ,",
    "a consistent treatment between the atmospheric profile and the interior profile is mandatory to yield reliable results , both in the irradiated and non - irradiated case .",
    "the theory , in its most simple foundation ( 1d irradiation , with incoming flux deposited uniformly over the day side and no dynamical redistribution of the incident flux due to day - night temperature differences ) is found to adequately reproduce the radius of @xmath1 .",
    "these conclusions , of course , rely on @xmath1 being a genuine exoplanet .",
    "recent high resolution spectroscopic observations seem to support this conclusion ( konacki et al .",
    "if @xmath1 is confirmed to be , unambiguously , a planet , then the present results add intriguing support to the suggestion that the large radius of @xmath0 might be due to ongoing tidal interaction with an undetected companion .",
    "however , we show that a very small fraction of the stellar incident flux , transformed into large scale kinetic energy partly dissipated at the internal adiabatic level , is sufficient to modify substantially a planet s internal entropy rate and thus evolution .",
    "this fraction is unlikely to be larger than a few 0.1% , but certainly depends on the irradiation conditions .",
    "a fraction @xmath2 to 0.5 % would superbly reproduce the observations of the two presently detected transits , @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the present theory allows us to derive the fundamental properties of hot - jupiters ( mass , temperature , radius ) and their observable spectroscopic or photometric signatures as a function of age and orbital distance .",
    "additional transit detections will also allow better constraints on possible irradiation induced dissipative processes , as explored in this letter .",
    "comparisons between the present evolution theory and transit or direct detections of exoplanets will greatly improve our understanding of these objects and provide strong motivation for exploring this exciting new field of astronomy .",
    "part of this work was conducted at the anglo - australian observatory , under the auspice of the franco - australian pics program .",
    "this research was supported in part by the ltsa grant nag 5 - 3435 to wichita state university ."
