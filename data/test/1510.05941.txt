    "empirical evidence is mounting that living systems and communities of them might operate at the vicinity of a critical point @xcite .",
    "criticality , with its concomitant scale invariance , power laws distributions , and extremely large correlations and response @xcite could be a possible source of functional advantages for biological systems@xcite .",
    "in particular , in the brain one of the flagships of the criticality hypothesis it could lead to maximal dynamic ranges , high sensitivity to stimuli , optimal transmission and storage of information , and very diverse dynamical repertoires @xcite .",
    "different mechanisms and scenarios have been described in the recent literature to explain how such a critical behavior comes about @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some authors have argued that apparent criticality could be just an artifact of the attempt to fit overly simplified models to complex and highly heterogeneous systems @xcite .    in a recent work with a fresh perspective  @xcite , criticality has been shown to emerge in communities of individuals / agents trying to communicate with each other and creating a collective entity .",
    "this approach considers a community of individuals equipped with a ( genetic , neural , regulation ... ) network representing the internal configuration of each individual agent .",
    "the state of each of such networks is controlled by some parameters that completely determine the steady state probability distribution function of internal configurations .",
    "it is assumed that the state of each single agent is defined by such a probability distribution .",
    "each individual of the community tries to mimic , i.e. to infer or `` understand '' , the state of others within a community . with unexpected generality , under this dynamics",
    ", the community experiences a drift toward the critical point of the network dynamics , i.e. at the edge between ordered and disordered states .",
    "remarkably , this emerging criticality entails a large variability among individuals ; indeed , in the critical regime , small variations in parameter values are reflected in large state changes .",
    "this leads to the somehow surprising conclusion that individuals aiming at understanding each other in the best possible way thus having the possibility to coordinate their behavior and reactions end up exhibiting a large variability .",
    "naively , one could have anticipated that such individuals could have converged to an `` ordered phase '' in which a deterministic and fixed output would be easily predictable or , alternatively , to a `` disordered phase '' in which they all would be essentially random and alike . however , as shown in @xcite , such hypothetical solutions turn out to be unstable against fluctuations or noise , and the criticality is the only feasible outcome .    in this paper",
    ", we present a variant of the model proposed in  @xcite , which maintains the same phenomenology , but is formulated in a simpler setting .",
    "this allows us to characterize quantitatively the dynamics , being able to describe mathematically both the steady state and the transient under different conditions .",
    "using this simpler model , we elucidate how and why criticality comes about and investigate what are the roles of cooperation and competition among agents .",
    "the manuscript is structured as follows : in section [ sec : framework ] we outline the framework introduced in @xcite in a simple and concise way . in section [ sec : model ] , we describe a variant of the original model susceptible to mathematical analysis , while in section [ sec : results ] we study the attractors of such dynamics by employing a mathematical formalism which allows to map a community of interacting agents into an effective fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : nu ] we study a generalization of the model in which individuals can also cooperate or compete .",
    "consider a community of @xmath0 individuals / agents trying to imitate as much as possible the state of each other .",
    "each of these individuals is characterized by a set of @xmath1 internal computing units ( i.e. nodes of a network ) that , for simplicity , we assume to take binary values . therefore , the internal state of each single agent is fully characterized by the string @xmath2 .",
    "this state changes in time , @xmath3 , obeying some dynamical rules leading to a stationary probability distribution @xmath4 , where the @xmath5-dimensional variable @xmath6 accounts for all the parameters modulating the dynamics ( where @xmath5 is the dimension of the parameter space ) , as for instance the strength of couplings between network nodes .",
    "each individual agent ( i.e. its internal state ) is completely determined by the value of @xmath7 and , for simplicity , all individuals are assumed to be identical and to obey the same internal dynamical rules except , possibly , for the specific values of their internal parameters . in other words ,",
    "each agent is characterized by its coordinates in a common parameter space .",
    "let us emphasize that the framework introduced here consists in a rather sketched idealization of specific biological systems , which aims at generality rather than specificity .",
    "however , to provide the reader with some intuition , one could think of a community of bacteria in which individuals are sensitive and responsive to others , and they reconfigure their internal state ( as described for instance by their gene regulatory networks , with intricate feedback mechanism between signals and gene state switches ) in order to behave similarly to others .",
    "this may be relevant in a variety of processes that require of ( or benefit from ) a collective response at the community level .",
    "the main goal of this work is to underline the non - trivial attractors that could emerge out of this type of `` imitation '' game at its relationship with criticality .",
    "certainly , our framework should be carefully adapted to describe specific biological problems .    before proceeding and for the sake of self - consistency we briefly recall two basic concepts of information theory : the kullback - leibler divergence and the fisher information .",
    "readers familiar with these concepts can safely skip the following two paragraphs .",
    "* the kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence * @xcite allows for quantifying the difference between two probability distributions .",
    "for instance , given the parameter sets @xmath7 and @xmath8 characterizing two probability distribution functions , the kl divergence from the second distribution to the first is defined as @xcite : @xmath9 where the average @xmath10 is taken over @xmath11 . in short ,",
    "( [ eq : kl ] ) measures the deficit of information when @xmath12 is used to approximate @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "importantly , the kl divergence constitutes a pseudo - distance , as it does not obey the triangle inequality , and is not symmetric as in general @xmath13 , except in the case in which both distribution are identical ( in which case the divergence vanishes ) .    *",
    "the fisher information ( fi ) * is a measure of how _ distinguishable _ is a ( finite ) dataset extracted from a probability distribution from another one obtained with slightly different parameter values .",
    "for example , there could be a region in @xmath7 space in which @xmath4 are mostly invariant as we change @xmath7 , while in another regions the distribution could be highly sensitive to parameter changes .",
    "the fi is defined as @xcite : @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "the determinant @xmath16 is a measure of the density of distinguishable distributions in parametric space ( as a function of @xmath7 ) @xcite . in particular , if @xmath16 peaks at @xmath17 , this corresponds to a region in the space of parameters @xmath7 in which distributions are highly sensitive to changes of the parameters .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the fi exhibits a peak at critical points @xcite .    to illustrate these concepts , without loss of generality",
    ", we can parametrize the internal probability distribution of agents as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the so - called `` observable '' functions ( i.e. functions of the internal configuration ) and @xmath20 .",
    "if , in particular , @xmath21 , the internal state of each agent corresponds to a mean - field ising model at some temperature @xcite .",
    "for such a parametrization , eq .",
    "( [ eq : parametrization ] ) , the fi is @xmath22 , which corresponds to the generalized susceptibility , that is well - known to diverge at critical points .",
    "consequently , in terms of information theory , most distinguishable patterns are concentrated around the critical point @xcite .",
    "in what follows , we mainly work with two different parametrizations .",
    "the simplest one corresponds to the ( zero - field ) ising mean - field model @xcite : @xmath23 which has the advantage of having just only one free parameter @xmath24 ( usually interpreted as the inverse temperature ) and has a fi peaked at @xmath25 , which diverges at @xmath26 in the ( thermodynamic ) limit , @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , we also consider the mean - field ising model with an external field ( which has two parameters ) : @xmath28 which has a fi that diverges as @xmath27 at @xmath29 .",
    "this corresponds to i ) a line of first order phase transitions for @xmath30 and @xmath31 and ii ) a second order phase transition at @xmath30 and @xmath32 .",
    "as it will become clear in what follows , we are more interested in the second case as , for any finite system size @xmath1 , the maximum of the determinant of the fi is closer to @xmath33 ( i.e. the critical point of the second - order phase transition ) than to any other point along the discontinuous phase transition line .",
    "we use the notation @xmath34 for the critical point  defined in the thermodynamic limit @xmath27  while @xmath35 is used for the maximum of @xmath16 in parameter space for any given size @xmath1 .",
    "we introduce a model , which is identical in spirit to the co - evolutionary model in @xcite but which , in contrast , enables for analytical understanding . here",
    "we discuss both the original and the modified models , stressing their similitudes and differences .",
    "both models consist of a community of @xmath0 individuals aiming at having an internal state / distribution as similar as possible to the others as quantified by their kl divergences to other individuals i.e. aiming at optimizing the information they have from the rest of the community , i.e. at minimizing its information deficit ( see fig . [",
    "fig : model ] ) . in both cases ,",
    "individual agents are characterized by an internal state ( probability distribution function ) parametrized as described in the previous section .",
    "all individuals are identical in principle , but they may differ in their parameter values .      in the original model",
    "( see `` coevolutionary model '' in @xcite ) the dynamics proceeded by randomly selecting at each time step a pair of agents ; given that the kl divergence is not symmetric , one of the two agents has a larger `` fitness '' ( i.e. it infers better the state of the other than the other way around ) and thus , as a consequence of this informational advantage , it has a larger probability of generating progeny .",
    "reversely , the less fit agent is more likely to die and be removed from the community , while the fittest one generates an offspring that inherits its parameter values  with some small variability from it .",
    "this dynamical process is iterated in time , defining in this way a genetic algorithm .",
    "after sufficiently long time the stable output of this dynamics turned out to be that the community of agents evolved to have intrinsic parameters located around the corresponding critical point .",
    "results in @xcite were mostly computational , even if some heuristic understanding was also provided .",
    "analytical progress was hindered by the intrinsic difficulty of dealing mathematically with the genetic algorithm as defined above .",
    "for this reason , our first goal in this paper is to construct a version of the original model that , while leaving intact the main phenomenology allows for analytical treatment .      with this motivation , we propose to analyze a slightly different model .",
    "this is not an evolutionary one , in the sense that agents do not die nor reproduce .",
    "instead it is an adaptive one in which agents slightly change their parameters trying to enhance their fitness .",
    "thus , we model each agent @xmath36 by its position in parameter space @xmath37 ; it experiences an _ adaptive force _ which is a function of its information - deficit respect to the other agents , plus some stochastic noise and that can be written as the derivative of some ( pseudo)potential , @xmath38 . in particular , the adaptive model is defined by means of the set of langevin equations @xmath39 for @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the force that an individual agent @xmath42 produces on an agent @xmath36 , which depends solely on the kl divergence from the second to the first . the first term in the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : langevin ] ) is the averaged force acting upon agent @xmath36 , which points in the direction of the potential gradient .",
    "observe that , in the most general case , @xmath38 is a pseudo - potential and not a true potential , because , owing to the asymmetry of the kl divergence , @xmath43 , the forces in eq .",
    "( [ eq : langevin ] ) do not obey the potentiality ( schwarz ) condition .",
    "still , even in such cases , the force can be defined as the derivative of such a pseudo - potential . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : langevin ] ) represents a thermal noise which is an ineluctably present ingredient of any biological process and that as we will see plays an important role in the dynamical process ( getting rid of unstable solutions ) . in particular",
    ", @xmath44 modulates the noise amplitude , and @xmath45 is a white noise with @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , and @xmath15 ) .    to complete the model definition we still need to specify the functional form of the pseudo - potential @xmath49 .",
    "the main constraint we need to impose is that @xmath38 has to increase monotonically with @xmath43 ( i.e. @xmath50 ) in order to guarantee that the dynamical process , which converges to minima of @xmath38 , leads also to minimal values of the kl divergence . in this way , at each time step , each agent @xmath36 changes its parameter , @xmath51 , in the direction of the gradient of the averaged @xmath38 , with some added stochasticity . here",
    "for reasons explained in detail in [ sec : concavity] we restrict our analysis to the case of a convex potential @xmath52 .",
    "having specified the shape of @xmath38 and thus the full model , the question is : where does the community evolve to as a consequence of this information - based dynamics ? in the next section we derive a mathematical approach to compute the attractors of the dynamics in the space of parameters @xmath7 for different choices of the ( pseudo)potential @xmath53 .",
    "is composed of @xmath1 internal binary units ; its internal state is represented by the probability distribution @xmath54 for each configuration @xmath55 .",
    "the free parameter @xmath51 controls the internal dynamics and all individuals obey the same dynamical rules ( some type of probability distribution function , but possibly with different parameter values ) . at each time , individual @xmath36 changes its parameter @xmath51 in the direction that minimizes its average information - deficit respect to the community , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the kullback - leibler divergence ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : kl ] ) ) from @xmath54 to @xmath58 , and @xmath53 is some increasing ( pseudo - potential ) function of @xmath43 .",
    "additionally , there is some randomness in the dynamical process .",
    "the focus is in the adaptation of the whole community in the space of parameters @xmath7 ; does it converge , and if so , where ? ]",
    "we are interested in the evolution of the distribution of agents in parameter space , defined as : @xmath59 luckily enough , there exists an analytical method to map a set of particle - like agents ( interacting among themselves by means of langevin dynamics ) into an equation for the probability distribution of their positions in the space in which they move .",
    "such a method was proposed by dean in @xcite ( an earlier reference to this equation can be found in the work of kawasaki @xcite ) , and it allows us to derive an equation for @xmath60 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : langevin ] ) . this calculation can be simply understood as the change of variables @xmath61 using the ito s calculus ( see [ sec : dean ] or ref .",
    "@xcite for the explicit derivation ) , leading to the following equation for the probability distribution : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a new gaussian noise with zero mean and correlation @xmath64 ( @xmath15 ) , interpreted in the ito s sense @xcite .",
    "observe that , in the limit @xmath65 , eq . ( [ eq : dean ] ) becomes deterministic , and we find an equation for @xmath66 , which , roughly speaking , is a sort of non - linear fokker - planck equation @xcite in which the drift term depends on the distribution @xmath67 itself .",
    "observe that eq .",
    "( [ eq : dean ] ) synthesizes the evolution of the community in a single dynamical equation . before proceeding ,",
    "some remarks are in order : ( i ) the global gradient ensures the conservation of the total probability ( no individuals are created or annihilated ) ; ( ii ) the diffusive term comes from fluctuations in the dynamics ( controlled by @xmath68 ) ; ( iii ) at any region where there are no individuals ( i.e. , where @xmath69 ) , the distribution does not change ( both the deterministic and the stochastic terms vanish ; i.e. it is an absorbing state / region @xcite ) .",
    "we can infer the shape of @xmath67 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dean ] ) ; in the case in which the drift force is small ( which occurs , for instance , when individuals are very close to each other , as expected if the dynamics is cohesive ) , the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dean ] ) becomes negligible , and @xmath67 is expected to look like a gaussian distribution .",
    "also , for a narrow distribution , we can anticipate that , if we expand the drift term ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : drift ] ) ) in taylor series around the centroid of the community , first order contributions will cancel after integrating in the community ( as individuals approach each other , the overall force almost vanishes ) , and second order terms controlling concavity / convexity of @xmath38 may play an important role of the dynamics ( see [ sec : concavity ] for further details ) .",
    "anyway , a detailed calculation needs to be performed in order to clarify these questions for each specific case .    employing eq .",
    "( [ eq : dean ] ) it is possible to derive a set of deterministic equations for the evolution of its moments for @xmath65 . the mean @xmath70",
    "can be obtained multiplying eq .",
    "( [ eq : dean ] ) by @xmath7 and integrating by parts : @xmath71 where @xmath72 . similarly for the covariance matrix , defined as @xmath73 ( @xmath15 ) ,",
    "we find : @xmath74 these equations can not be integrated as the evolution of the mean and covariance matrix still depends on the whole distribution @xmath67 , i.e. they are not a closed set of equations .",
    "however , in the next section we derive an approximation allowing us to circumvent this difficulty and characterize the evolution of the community by the mean and covariance matrix of the distribution in parameter space .      here",
    "we develop an approximate scheme giving rise to a closed set of explicit equations for the evolution of the mean and covariance matrix of parameters in the community . to this end , we first expand @xmath75 around @xmath76 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mu1 ] ) and ( [ eq : k1 ] ) , and integrate over @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see supplementary material for a detailed derivation ) ; the result is then implicitly given as a function of moments of @xmath67 .",
    "this expansion can be truncated at some level of approximation ; the first contributing terms are ( see supplementary material ) : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the susceptibility as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fi ] ) , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is the @xmath81 moment of the distribution of parameters , @xmath66 . for the case in which @xmath38 has a local minimum at @xmath82 ( i.e. , @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : secondmom1 ] ) vanishes , and one needs to keep further terms in the expansion , obtaining a slightly more complex expression ( see [ sec : v0 ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq : firstmom1 ] ) and ( [ eq : secondmom1 ] ) can not be integrated , as we still need additional equations for the 4-th moment @xmath80 .",
    "we circumvent this problem by approximating the 4-th moment in terms of the second ones ( moment closure ) .",
    "thus we assume that @xmath67 is approximately gaussian . to justify this ansatz",
    "we can argue that , for small noise variance @xmath68 , individuals stay close to each other . as revealed by eq .",
    "[ eq : firstmom1 ] , the effect of the drift is weaker for narrower distributions , and the dynamics is essentially diffusive ( at least locally ) , which leads to a gaussian distribution .",
    "furthermore , we have corroborated that the results obtained from this approach match well numerical simulations for small values of @xmath68 , while the approximation breaks down for larger values .",
    "therefore , we simply take @xmath85 , obtaining closed equations for the first and second moments . in particular , for the case of just one parameter ( @xmath86 ) we find : @xmath87 or a slightly different second equation if @xmath83 ( [ sec : v0 ] ) . from this set of equations , we can see that :    * the centroid of the community , @xmath88 , follows the direction of the gradient of the fi , and the sign of @xmath89 controls the direction in which individuals move : while the community follows the direction which maximizes the fi for @xmath84 , the opposite occurs for @xmath90 , i.e. , individuals follow the direction which minimizes it ( see [ sec : concavity ] ) .",
    "if the fi experiences an abrupt change of its shape , this should be translated into an abrupt change of the dynamics ( see , for instance , how the community rapidly goes from the transient to the stationary regime in figs .",
    "[ fig:1dim ] and [ fig:2dim ] ) . *",
    "the variance of the distribution , @xmath91 , changes owing to two opposite mechanisms : it increases owing to fluctuations ( controlled by @xmath68 ) , while it shrinks as the result of interactions ( faster in regions with higher fi ) .",
    "therefore , if the fi diverges in the thermodynamic limit , all individuals should be concentrated _ at _ the critical point . * in a noiseless scenario ( @xmath92 ) , the variance of the distribution vanishes in the stationary limit , @xmath93 ( i.e. all individuals have the same parameter values ) , and the dynamics can stop before the community has reached the global maximum of the fi .",
    "noise destabilizes these kind of attractors , and the only stable solution is the critical point .",
    "imposing stationarity in the previous equations , it is straightforward to derive the steady - state distribution , which is centered at the maximum of the fi , @xmath94 , and has variance @xmath95 ( see [ sec : v0 ] for the case @xmath83 ) . thus , as @xmath96 diverges for @xmath97 , all individuals will locate exactly _ at _ the critical point , @xmath98 , in the thermodynamic limit , and very close to it for large but finite internal system sizes .",
