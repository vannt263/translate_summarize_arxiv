    "we claim that @xmath81 contains the first crossing of @xmath24 in each even gap in its original sign .",

    "now consider the strand of @xmath81 that first enters @xmath62 as we travel through @xmath81 naturally .",
    "this strand has to come from the left side of @xmath62 by the above observation .",
    "but then it fails the test given in remark [ r_cor ] since @xmath62 is descending in @xmath24 and can not be changed in @xmath81 .",
    "this gives us the needed contradiction .",
    "it now follows that @xmath81 has at least two crossings in each even gap .",

    "the consequence of claims 1 to 4 is that if we write @xmath157 as a laurent polynomial of @xmath1 whose coefficients are laurent polynomials of @xmath2 , then it contains a nontrivial term of the form @xmath191 and all other terms have degrees less than @xmath168 , that is , @xmath165 . to obtain @xmath146",
    ", we will use @xmath192 and ( [ e2 ] ) , where @xmath193 is obtained from @xmath24 by keeping the first crossing and flipping the last crossing in each odd gap , and smoothing all other crossings .",
    "the details are left to the reader .",
    "finally , if @xmath24 is a non - splittable reduced negative - leading alternating braid diagram , then its mirror image @xmath194 is a non - splittable reduced positive - leading alternating braid diagram and we have @xmath195 .",
    "let @xmath196 and @xmath197 be the highest and lowest degrees of @xmath1 in @xmath198 .",
    "then by the first part of the lemma , we have @xmath199 and @xmath200 . therefore by remark  [ tree_formula_remark ] we have @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "[ remark4.4 ] _ another way to handle the case when @xmath24 is a non - splittable reduced negative - leading alternating braid diagram is to take its connected sum with a positive hopf link , thus creating a new first gap with a single pair of positive crossings .",
    "the statement now follows the positive leading case and from the fact that the braid index is additive under taking the connected sum .",
    "_    finally , as another application of theorem [ p3 ] , we provide a short proof to the following theorem .",
    "this result seems to be known @xcite , although we failed to find a specific proof in the literature .",
    "[ t4.4 ] let @xmath24 be the closure of a reduced alternating braid on @xmath0 strands , then the leading coefficient in the alexander polynomial of @xmath24 is @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath203 be the alexander polynomial of @xmath24 , then @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "assume that @xmath24 is positive leading , substituting @xmath205 , @xmath206 in ( [ e1 ] ) leads to @xmath207 construct @xmath208 by the following procedure : ( i ) for the first gap of @xmath24 , smooth all crossings ( which are positive ) except the last one , which we will flip and cross it into the second gap .",
    "once there , we have no choice but to keep the first ( negative ) crossing we encounter which will lead us into the third gap . ( ii ) now we will smooth all crossings we encounter ( negative and positive ones in the second and the third gaps ) until we encounter the last positive crossing in the third gap .",
    "notice that in doing so we may have reached the bottom of the braid at @xmath209 and returned to the top of the braid at @xmath210 , so this last positive crossing we encounter may not be the last positive crossing in the third gap . at this positive",
    "crossing we flip it and cross it into the next gap and repeat ( ii ) .",
    "this process is repeated until we reach the last gap and we can and will smooth all crossings in the last gap except one , no matter it is even or odd . at this point , we have exactly one positive crossing in each odd gap but may have negative crossings in the even gaps that we have not visited .",
    "however in the last gap we only have one crossing left and we will be traveling back through this crossing .",
    "as one can easily verify , each time we travel back to an even gap it is through the only crossing left in the odd gap to its right , so if there are any negative crossings that we have not visited before , these crossings will be between the two positive crossings in the two odd gaps to the left and right of the said even gap . by the descending rule , we can and will smooth all these crossings .",
    "thus we have shown that @xmath208 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the total number of crossings in @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , it is also rather easy to see that @xmath214 implies @xmath215 .",
    "finally we leave it to our reader to verify that @xmath216 is the only element in @xmath136 with the property @xmath217 .",
    "the result of the theorem then follows .",
    "if @xmath24 is negative leading , we will simply apply the above argument to ( [ e2 ] ) instead .",
    "in this section we show that the homfly polynomial formation ( [ e1 ] ) given in theorem  [ p3 ] is equivalent to the expansion derived by f.  jaeger for braids in @xcite .",
    "thus our approach used to prove proposition  [ p3 ] provides an alternative ( and in fact shorter ) proof of his expansion . unlike our approach ( which is combinatorial in nature ) , jaeger stated his formula using a concept called the _ admissible circuit partitions _ of a braid diagram .",
    "we establish this equivalence by showing that for any braid @xmath24 , there is a bijection between the leaf vertices in the descending resolving tree @xmath94 and the admissible circuit partitions of @xmath24 , such that each leaf vertex and its corresponding admissible partition under this bijection make the same contributions to their respective homfly polynomial formulas .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the essential concepts introduced by f.  jaeger with some small modification of the terminology to make the terms more consistent with our current paper .",
    "interested readers please refer to @xcite for the details and his original terminologies .",
    "given a braid diagram @xmath24 , a circuit partition @xmath218 of @xmath24 is a braid diagram obtained from @xmath24 by smoothing every crossing in a subset @xmath219 of its crossings , while leaving the other crossings unchanged .",
    "the smoothed crossings are denoted by small dotted circles in figure 5 .",
    "we can identify a circuit partition @xmath218 by the ordered pair @xmath220 where @xmath24 is the original braid diagram and @xmath219 the set of crossings of @xmath24 to be smoothed .",
    "two circuit partitions @xmath220 and @xmath221 are defined to be equal if and only if @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "let @xmath62 be a crossing in @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath62 is smoothed , the upper left part of the strand entering @xmath62 is connected to the lower left part of the strand exiting @xmath62 and the resulting curve is called a _ left tangence _ at @xmath62 .",
    "similarly one can define the _",
    "right tangence _ at @xmath62 .",
    "while traveling through @xmath218 naturally , we will meet each crossing in @xmath24 exactly twice ( including the crossings that have been smoothed ) .",
    "a smoothed crossing @xmath62 in @xmath218 is said to be _",
    "admissible _ if it has the following property .",
    "if @xmath62 is a positive crossing , then the first passage at @xmath62 is a left tangence , if @xmath62 is negative in @xmath24 , then the first passage at @xmath62 is a right tangence .",

    "in particular , @xmath24 itself is an admissible circuit partition , in which no crossing is smoothed .",
    "we denote the set of admissible circuit partitions of @xmath24 by @xmath224 .",
    "then in @xcite jaeger showed that for any braid diagram @xmath24 on @xmath0 strands , @xmath225 where @xmath226 , @xmath227 is the number of crossings in @xmath219 , @xmath228 is the number of negative crossings in @xmath219 and @xmath229 is the number of components in the closure of @xmath218 .",

    "up to the crossing @xmath62 , traveling through @xmath218 naturally is the same as traveling through @xmath24 naturally since nothing has been changed up to that point . since @xmath62 is descending , the first strand entering @xmath62 is the top strand at @xmath62 , and smoothing @xmath62 results in a right tangence if @xmath62 is positive and in a left tangence if @xmath62 is negative .",

    "the set of leaves @xmath136 is the union of the sets @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "note that this union is disjoint , since @xmath62 is not smoothed in elements of @xmath245 but is smoothed in elements of @xmath246 . using an argument similar to the one used in the case @xmath235 , we see that for every admissible circuit partition @xmath247 , @xmath219 does not contain any crossing preceding @xmath62 when we travel along the strands of @xmath24 naturally thus each @xmath248 can be identified with @xmath249 if @xmath250 , and with @xmath251 if @xmath252 .",
    "let @xmath253 be the inverse of this identifying map ( which is a bijection , of course ) .",
