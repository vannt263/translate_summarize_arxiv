    "the standard model ( sm ) has been worked very well for a long time , and its last missing piece , the higgs boson , was finally discovered by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiment at cern  @xcite .",
    "this is a triumph of the sm and a great step to understand physics at the electroweak scale .",
    "however , there are many unsolved problems within the sm , for example , the observed dark matter particles and baryon asymmetry in the universe . from theoretical viewpoint , the gauge hierarchy problem is still in question .",
    "hence , there have been many attempts to solve such problems in frameworks beyond the sm .    in a bottom - up approach towards new physics beyond the sm ,",
    "an attractive option is to study the two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) .",
    "they are simple and may be low - energy effective theories of various new physics models . since 2hdms generally have dangerous flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) , we particularly consider 2hdms with softly broken @xmath0 symmetry which suppresses the fcncs . if two higgs fields do not distinguish the generations of quarks and leptons , the models are classified , with respect to the yukawa interactions , into four types : type - i , type - ii , type - x , and type - y .",
    "one of the important feature of 2hdms is that there is a new cp violation source in the higgs potential .    in general , the powerful tool to seek new physics",
    "including 2hdms is of course the lhc which may directly probe physics up to a few tev . another possibility is provided by low energy precision measurements , such as in flavor physics .",
    "the remarkable feature is that these measurements have a potential to investigate new physics beyond the lhc reach by orders of magnitude . in particular , the electric dipole moments ( edms )",
    "are interesting because the edms are highly sensitive to cp violation in physics beyond the sm",
    ". while the sm predictions of edms are much lower than the current experimental bounds , assuming the strong cp problem is solved by some mechanism , such as the peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite , new physics around tev scale would give large values within the reach of the future edm measurements @xcite .",
    "in addition , the electroweak baryogenesis ( ewbg )  @xcite , which needs a new cp violation source , may lead to larger values of edms than the sm predictions .",
    "the edm measurements , therefore , are concrete tests on 2hdms containing a new cp phase . in the models ,",
    "the one - loop contributions to the fermionic edms are too small to observed since those contributions are proportional to the third power of small yukawa couplings .",
    "some two - loop diagrams , called the barr - zee diagrams  @xcite , which we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : barr - zee ] , may give sizable contributions to the edms , since they are suppressed by only one power of small yukawa couplings .",
    "these diagrams contain one - loop effective vertices , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the type - ii case was evaluated in refs .",
    "@xcite , but the results in the previous works are not gauge invariant .",
    "we improve this point by using the pinch technique  @xcite and make the barr - zee diagrams gauge invariant .",
    "we also study edms in the other three types as well as the type - ii .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2hdm ] , we briefly review the 2hdms with softly - broken @xmath0 symmetry . in sec .",
    "[ sec : subdiagram ] , we study the tensor structure of the effective vertices which are needed to evaluate the barr - zee diagrams , and show the gauge invariant tensor structure . after that , we calculate the effective vertices explicitly and show that the diagrams which include the gauge bosons are not gauge invariant .",
    "this implies that we need some non - barr - zee diagrams to make the effective vertices gauge invariant .",
    "we show it by using the pinch technique .",
    "the formulae of the gauge invariant barr - zee diagrams are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : barr - zee ] , and their numerical evaluation is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : neumerical ] .",
    "there we discuss the complementarity between the electron and neutron edm measurements in discrimination of 2hdms , and also prospects of future experiments .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "notations and details of the calculation are given in the appendices .",
    "we briefly review the models discussed in this paper .",
    "we have two higgs doublets , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and they have the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "the higgs doublets are parametrized as follows , @xmath14 in order to avoid the dangerous fcnc problems , we introduce the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry is assumed to be softly broken so that the domain - wall formation in the early universe is suppressed . under this symmetry ,",
    "the higgs doublets are translated into @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and the higgs potential is given as @xmath17 the third and last terms in this potential contain complex parameters .",
    "while one of them can be eliminated by redefinition of higgs fields , another phase is physical so that cp symmetry is broken . in this paper",
    "we take the higgs vevs , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , real using the gauge symmetry and also redefinition of a higgs field . in this basis ,",
    "two phases in the potential are related to each others by the stationary condition of the potential , @xmath20 . in this paper",
    "we choose @xmath21 as an input parameter for cp violation .",
    "we also use the following variables for convenience in this paper , @xmath22 and where @xmath23 @xmath24 is the fermi constant .",
    "it is easy to find the charged higgs boson mass , @xmath25 on the other hand , since cp symmetry is broken in the higgs potential , we need to diagonalize a 3 by 3 matrix to find the neutral higgs masses .",
    "the yukawa interaction in this model is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 or 2 , depending on the type of 2hdms . while up - type quarks couple to only to @xmath13 , leptons and down - type quarks couple to either @xmath12 or @xmath13 due to the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we summarize which higgs fields couple to fermions in table  [ tab : type_summary ] .    the detail information of the models , such as mass eigenvalues , mixings , and interactions of the higgs bosons ,",
    "are given in appendix  a.    .15 in    .summary of the higgs fields which couple to quarks and leptons in four types . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : nedm_future ]    it is found that the neutron edm in the type - x case has similar behavior to the type - i in low @xmath29 region because the down quark yukawa couplings in these two types are the same .",
    "the difference in high @xmath29 region between figs .",
    "[ fig : nedm1 ] and [ fig : nedmx ] is due to the large @xmath29 enhancement of the tau lepton yukawa coupling .",
    "the behavior of the neutron edm in the type - y case is quite similar to the type - ii case .",
    "this is because the cedm contribution is dominant in both cases .",
    "it is found in comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig : eedm ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : nedm ] that both measurements of the electron and neutron edms are complementary to each others in order to discriminate the 2hdms .",
    "we may choose one from the four models in future .",
    "+    before closing this section , we would like to give a comment on the constraints on the parameter space .",
    "we have shown that some parameter regions are constrained by edms in figs .",
    "[ fig : eedm ] and [ fig : nedm ] .",
    "the constrained regions have an overlap with other constraints , such as flavor physics @xcite or direct search of heavy higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "note that it is known that the custodial @xmath30 symmetry is broken in the higgs potential in 2hdms with the cp violation , and @xmath31 parameter might deviate from one at the one loop level @xcite .",
    "however , if heavy higgs boson mass scale @xmath32 is large or if coupling @xmath33 are not large , this contribution is small .",
    "we checked that this contribution does not conflict with the current bound in all figure of this paper .",
    "in this paper , we evaluated fermionic edms in 2hdms with softly broken @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we started by calculating the barr - zee diagrams in a gauge invariant way by using the pinch technique .",
    "the modification by the gauge invariant calculation is 5%-8% numerically .",
    "this does not change the previous result drastically , but important because physical quantities must be calculated in a gauge invariant way .",
    "we evaluated the electron and neutron edms in all four types in the 2hdms .",
    "we find that type - ii and type - x 2hdms are strongly constrained by the latest acme experiment bound on the electron edm .",
    "the electron and neutron edm measurements will improve in the future experiments .",
    "they are possible to seek physics at @xmath2(10 )  tev scale ( fig .",

    "although they are naively expected to be smaller than the contributions from the barr - zee diagrams , they would become important once experiments find the edms and start precise measurements . to evaluate them",
    ", we need to calculate all diagrams at two - loop level .",
    "this issue may be discussed elsewhere .",
    "it is worth referring to relation between ewbg and edms . in the 2hdms",
    ", it is known that ewbg may occur through a strongly first order electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite numerically showed that the 2hdms with softly - broken @xmath0 symmetry may accommodate a strongly first order phase transition when the lightest neutral higgs boson is around 125 gev . in order to achieve the ewbg",
    ", one needs some cp violation phases in higgs potential .",
    "the edm searches could indirectly constrain parameter space which achieve the ewbg . in this paper , we find that low @xmath29 regions in 2hdms are disfavored by electron edm . on the other hand , in fact , a strongly first order phase transition , which is needed for ewbg , prefers low @xmath36 region @xcite .",
