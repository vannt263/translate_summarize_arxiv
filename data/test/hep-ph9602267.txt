    "this paper explores the phenomenology of the standard model s minimal supersymmetric @xcite extension with a continuous @xmath1 symmetry ( hereafter called the ` mr model')@xcite .",
    "this model of low - energy supersymmetry has a much smaller - dimensional parameter space than the minimal supersymmetric model with a discrete @xmath3-parity ( mssm @xcite ) . as a result , it has two attractive features .",
    "first , the mr model makes specific predictions of the values of a number of observables , such as the gaugino masses .",
    "in addition , the mr model is free of the superpotential term @xmath4 and the soft supersymmetry breaking terms @xmath5 that cause well - known theoretical difficulties in the mssm .",
    "we focus , in particular on the recent measurements of @xmath2 @xmath6 which yield a value @xmath7 @xcite that differs markedly from the one - loop standard model prediction @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the oblique and qcd corrections to the @xmath9-quark and hadronic decay widths of the @xmath10 each largely cancel when the ratio is formed , making @xmath2 very sensitive to direct corrections to the @xmath11 vertex  especially those involving the heavy top quark .",
    "our work complements some recent papers on susy models with discrete r - parity .",
    "the implications of the @xmath2 measurement for the mssm are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a region of the mssm parameter space that has some phenomenology similar to that of the mr model is studied in @xcite .",
    "the following section describes the mr model in more detail .",
    "we then compute the vertex corrections to @xmath2 in the mr model and find that the result is within @xmath12 of the experimental value so long as the lighter top squark is light enough ( and the charged higgs boson is heavy enough ) .",
    "section 4 discusses additional constraints that place a lower bound on the mass of the lighter top squark .",
    "the information that future experiments may yield is studied in section 5 ; ongoing and upcoming experiments at fnal and lep should be capable of confirming or excluding the mr model .",
    "the last section briefly summarizes our findings .",
    "the model explored in this paper is the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model in which @xmath3-parity is extended to a continuous @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "the continuous @xmath3-symmetry is defined by assigning @xmath3 charges + 1 to the superspace coordinate @xmath14 , + 1 to matter superfields and 0 to higgs superfields . in terms of component fields ,",
    "all ordinary particles carry zero @xmath3 charge while their superpartners have non - zero @xmath3-charge .",
    "the most general @xmath1-symmetric lagrangian is described by the superpotential @xmath15 where each term has @xmath16 , and the quark and lepton superfields @xmath17 @xmath18 have the usual @xmath19 gauge interactions .",
    "note the absence of a @xmath4 term which would violate the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the most general symmetry forbids majorana gaugino masses , the model contains an additional color octet chiral superfield to give a dirac mass to the gluino .",
    "this field appears only in the soft supersymmetry breaking potential .",
    "the gluino mass is relevant to this work in that it renders the 1-loop correction to @xmath2 from diagrams with internal gluinos and bottom squarks negligible compared to the effects of the diagrams considered here .",
    "we will therefore not mention the color octet superfield further .",
    "the effects of allowing the gluino to be extremely light in a @xmath1-symmetric model will be considered in future work . ]",
    "soft supersymmetry breaking potential consistent with our symmetries and a gim - like mechanism to naturally suppress flavor - changing neutral currents is : @xmath20 where we neglect small yukawa - suppressed corrections to the superpartners masses .",
    "note the characteristic absence of gaugino mass terms ( @xmath21 ) and trilinear scalar terms ( @xmath22 ) . for a more detailed description of the model",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
    "the non - standard one - loop corrections to @xmath2 considered in this paper are of two kinds .",
    "one involves the charged - higgs / top / bottom vertex ; the other , the chargino / stop / bottom vertex .",
    "they therefore involve the following parameters : charged higgs mass @xmath23 , chargino masses @xmath24 , stop mass eigenvalues @xmath25 , stop mixing angle @xmath26 , and ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath27 . in the remainder of this section , we focus on those aspects of the model that are directly relevant to determining the above parameters .",
    "first we should discuss masses .",
    "the charged higgs mass is given in terms of the @xmath28 mass as @xmath29 which implies that @xmath30 is heavier than @xmath31 .",
    "the charginos masses are @xmath32 @xmath33 we will soon find that in this model the charginos are nearly degenerate with the @xmath31 bosons . as it is relevant to the limits we will ultimately set on the top squark masses , we also note that at the one - loop level , the light neutral higgs boson has a mass of of the @xmath34 term in the superpotential and the coefficient @xmath35 of the trilinear scalar operators in the supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "those two coefficients vanish in the mr model because of the continuous @xmath1 symmetry . ]",
    "@xmath36 in the limit that @xmath37 , which allows bottom squark contributions to be neglected ; the reason this limit is preferred will become clear shortly .",
    "the values of the top squark masses are intimately connected to the physics of the lightest superpartner ( the photino ) .",
    "the photino is massless at tree level but , together with its dirac partner @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 in the notation of @xcite , acquires a dirac mass at one loop that is generated by the exchange of left- and right - handed top squarks@xcite @xmath40  from the cosmological point of view , the present mass density is bounded from above by @xmath41 .",
    "this implies a lower bound on the cross section for photino annihilation , @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath42 grows as the square of the photino mass , the result is a lee - weinberg  @xcite type of lower bound on the photino mass @xmath43^{-1 } ( \\omega_{\\tilde{\\gamma}}h^2)^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 runs over all squarks and sleptons of charge @xmath45 and mass @xmath46 such that the corresponding quarks and leptons are the possible final states of photino annihilation @xcite .",
    "since the photino can not be massless , equation ( [ photstop ] ) implies that the top squarks @xmath47 and @xmath48 can not be degenerate in the mr model .",
    "if one supposes @xmath48 to be lighter than @xmath47 , then , for a given mass of @xmath48 , one will find a lower bound on the mass of @xmath47 .",
    "for example , if @xmath49 gev , then @xmath50 gev .",
    "the top squark mass eigenstates @xmath51 and @xmath52 are related to @xmath48 and @xmath47 by @xmath53 which defines the mixing angle @xmath26 .",
    "we find that in order for the stop mass eigenvalues @xmath54,@xmath55 to be real , the stop mixing angle @xmath26 must be less than 10 degrees .",
    "thus , in the mr model , @xmath56 .    finally , we need to discuss @xmath57 .",
    "we have already seen that the overall scale of @xmath58 is of the order of 1 gev .",
    "this makes the decay @xmath59 possible , which in turn makes the @xmath10 invisible width larger than it is in the standard model .",
    "the branching fraction of @xmath60 is suppressed by a factor of @xmath61 relative to the standard model branching fraction for one @xmath62 species , @xmath63 .",
    "thus we have @xmath64 the experimental limit on the number of light neutrino species  @xcite , @xmath65 , therefore implies that at 95% c.l .",
    "@xmath27 lies very close which naturally appears in gut - inspired models with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking . ] to unity : @xmath66    the several parameters of the mr model are now essentially reduced to two .",
    "the stringent constraint @xmath67 forces the charginos to be approximately degenerate with the @xmath31 .",
    "the requirement that the photino not be massless forces the top squark mixing angle to be less than @xmath68 ; we take @xmath69 throughout our calculations . when @xmath69 , the superpartner of the right - handed top quark , @xmath48 is identical to the light top squark mass eigenstate @xmath51 ; since only @xmath48 enters the loop affecting the @xmath10 coupling to left - handed @xmath9 quarks , @xmath2 depends on @xmath54 but not @xmath55 .",
    "we are left with only two parameters on which @xmath2 will depend : @xmath23 and @xmath54 .",
    "in order to test the mr model , we can separate contributions to @xmath2 into those occurring in both the standard and mr models and those additional effects present only in the mr model . in the notation of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath70\\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ { \\nabla_b^{mr } } \\equiv { \\nabla_b}^{mr}(m_t ) -{\\nabla_b}^{mr}(0)\\nonumber \\label{citr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the one - loop level standard model prediction using a top quark mass of @xmath72 gev , @xmath73 is the standard model prediction assuming a massless top quark  @xcite , and @xmath74 is the sum of the one - loop interference with the tree graph divided by the squared amplitude of the tree graph . in the mr model ,",
    "there are two relevant types of non - standard one - loop vertex diagrams : those with internal charged - higgses and top quarks , and those with internal charginos and top squarks .",
    "their contributions to @xmath74 are proportional to @xmath75 ; the details of the calculation are presented in the appendix .",
    "another type of vertex diagram with internal neutralinos and bottom squarks makes contributions proportional to @xmath76 , which is negligible in the mr model because @xmath77 ; we omit these .",
    "-.5 in    -2em    -2em    in figure 1 , we plot @xmath78 , the contribution from the @xmath79  t vertex diagrams to @xmath80 , as a function of @xmath81 , when @xmath27 is taken to be 1 , 0.9 or 1.1 .",
    "the overall sign is negative and the value of @xmath82 shifts by @xmath83 as @xmath27 varies from 1 to 1.1 or 0.9 .",
    "figure 2 shows the corresponding contribution from @xmath84  @xmath85 loops to @xmath86 , as a function of the light top squark mass @xmath54 when the mixing angle @xmath26 between top squarks is @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the result is positive , and the deviation due to a 10@xmath89 shift in @xmath27 is negligible .",
    "thus the net shift in @xmath2 is due to a balance between the oppositely - signed contributions from the two types of loop diagrams . in figure 3",
    ", we set @xmath90 gev and plot @xmath2 as a function of @xmath23 for a range of @xmath27 ; we can clearly infer a lower bound on the allowed value of @xmath23 at fixed @xmath54 .",
    "likewise , figure 4 shows the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath54 for @xmath91 gev ; we can infer an upper bound on @xmath54 for fixed @xmath23 . in subsequent diagrams we plot results only for @xmath92 and",
    "keep in mind that an increase of 10% in @xmath57 corresponds to an increase of about 0.1% in @xmath2 for given @xmath23 and @xmath54 .    -2em",
    "-2em    figure 5 shows how the experimental 95% c.l .",
    "lower bound on @xmath2 separates the @xmath23 vs. @xmath54 parameter space into allowed and disallowed regions .",
    "recall that the @xmath93 loop gives negative corrections to @xmath2 , while the @xmath94 loop gives positive corrections . since the standard model prediction for @xmath2 lies well below the experimental lower bound ,",
    "some positive contribution is required to bring the mr prediction for @xmath2 into agreement with experiment .",
    "hence , by taking the charged higgs mass to infinity , one finds an asymptotic upper limit on the light stop mass of 180 gev at 95% c.l .",
    "the precise upper bound on @xmath54 will be smaller than 180 gev for any finite @xmath23 , due to the negative contribution to @xmath2 from the @xmath93 loop .",
    "for any fixed @xmath23 , the corresponding upper bound on @xmath54 can be read from figure 5 .    -1.5em",
    "combining the information gleaned from @xmath2 with other experimental data yields additional constraints on the mr model .",
    "first , we can use the lower bounds on the mass of the light neutral higgs ( @xmath95 ) boson to set a limit on @xmath55 . recall that the @xmath95 mass depends on the product of the top squark masses at the one - loop level .",
    "thus for a given light top squark mass , the heavier the heavy stop , the heavier the neutral higgs . then by setting the light top squark s mass to the maximum value of 180 gev and using the lower bound of 56 gev coupling lies between the extremes of the other two models .",
    "the @xmath96 coupling is proportional to @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the mixing angle that diagonalizes the neutral higgs mass matrix . throughout the parameter space of the mr model",
    ", @xmath99 is greater than about 0.75 ; it can take on smaller values in the mssm and is 1.0 in the standard model . ] that aleph @xcite sets on the @xmath95 mass in the mr model , we find that @xmath100 tev .",
    "if the mass of the @xmath51 is less than 180 gev , the lower bound on @xmath55 increases accordingly .",
    "-.25 in    -0.5em    the information on the masses of the top squarks provides limits on the photino mass , which depends on the masses of both top squarks at the one - loop level . to maintain naturalness",
    ", the masses of the sparticles should be of the order of a tev .",
    "if the mass of the heavy stop lies between 0.7 and 10 tev , the photino mass is between 2.5 and 10 gev .",
    "this is very helpful because both d0 @xcite and the lep collaborations have set limits on the allowed region of the @xmath101 vs.@xmath54 plane . for the narrow range of photino masses allowed in the mr model , these experiments essentially constrain the light stop mass to take values only in the ranges : ( 0  12 gev ) , ( 44 gev  46 gev ) , and ( 88 gev  180 gev ) .",
    "this is shown in figure 6 .",
    "a closer look then excludes the case @xmath102 gev .",
    "if the @xmath51 is this light , then in order for the @xmath95 mass to exceed the lep lower bound of 56 gev , the heavy stop would have to be heavier than about 24 tev . as a result ,",
    "the stop mixing angle would be almost precisely zero .",
    "the combination of such a light @xmath51 and such a small mixing angle has already been ruled out by opal  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the @xmath51 in the mr model must therefore lie in one of the upper two allowed ranges .",
    "in fact , preliminary results from the l3 collaboration based on the recent lep run at a center - of - mass energy of 130  140 gev show no signs of a top squark in the mass range below about 50 gev@xcite .",
    "it is therefore likely that the middle mass range for @xmath51 in the mr model is also excluded .",
    "we now briefly discuss several measurements that may provide useful information on the mr model in the future .",
    "these run the gamut from precision measurements to searches for new particles .",
    "since a light top squark could have an appreciable effect on the branching ratio for @xmath103 , we compare the ratio measured at cleo with that predicted by the mr model .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath104 measured in cleo  @xcite is @xmath105 the mr model predicts a branching ratio within @xmath12 of the cleo result whenever the light stop weighs in the regions of ( 44 gev  46 gev ) and ( 88 gev  180 gev ) .",
    "until future experiments reduce the errors on the @xmath106 branching ratio , this particular quantity will not help constrain the mr model .",
    "the relatively light mass of the @xmath51 in the mr model makes it possible for the top quark to decay to a top squark and a neutralino . as a result",
    ", the branching ratio for the standard top quark decay mode @xmath107 , which is approximately 100% in the standard model , would be only 70 ",
    "80% in the mr model .",
    "the limits on this branching ratio from cdf data @xcite are not strong enough to constrain the mr model  yet .",
    "once all of the 1994  5 data from lep are analyzed , the precise experimental limits on @xmath2 may shift .",
    "the potential consequences for the mr model are quite interesting .",
    "figure 7 shows contours corresponding to several values of @xmath2 near the current experimental @xmath12 lower bound .",
    "these curves imply that while the value of @xmath2 in the mr model is consistent with the present experimental value of @xmath2 , the theoretical prediction generally lies well below the experimental central value of 0.2205 @xcite .    as a result",
    ", the size of the allowed parameter space of the mr model depends sensitively on the experimental determination of @xmath2 .",
    "clearly even a very small downward shift in the central value of @xmath2 would allow @xmath54 to be heavier than 180 gev .",
    "on the other hand , an upward shift in the central value or an improvement in the errors on the current central value of @xmath2 could reduce the upper bound on @xmath54 to a value below 88 gev ",
    "i.e. into the region already excluded by d0 and lep .",
    "-.5 in    -0.5em    searches for top squarks in the d0 and cdf experiments should explore the remaining parameter space of the mr model .",
    "for example , the mass range @xmath108 gev can be probed by seeking top squarks in the decay channels @xmath109 , in addition to the @xmath110 channel already explored by d0 .",
    "the upcoming experiments at lep ii will also be sensitive to part of the allowed mass range for light top squarks .",
    "in addition , combining our upper bound on @xmath54 and the ` naturalness ' upper bound on @xmath55 with equation ( 7 ) implies an upper bound of @xmath111 90 gev on @xmath112 .",
    "searches for @xmath113 are discussed in ref .",
    "by considering the value of @xmath2 predicted by minimal @xmath1 symmetric supersymmetry , we have shown that this model is consistent with experiment so long as the light top squark weighs no more than 180 gev .",
    "other considerations , including top squark searches at lep and d0 , further restrict the top squark mass to satisfy @xmath114 gev .",
    "the light top squark of the mr model should therefore be accessible to d0 , cdf and the lep ii experiments .",
