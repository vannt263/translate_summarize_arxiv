    "recent observational data @xcite strongly indicate that the universe is spatially flat and accelerating at the present time . in the frame of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology",
    ", the acceleration may be attributed to some mysterious source called dark energy .",
    "the simplest candidate for dark energy seems to be a small positive cosmological constant , but it suffers from difficulties associated with the fine tuning and coincidence problem .",
    "an alternative is a dynamical scalar field , such as quintessence @xcite or phantom @xcite .",
    "the phantom field violates the energy conditions , which leads to many interesting cosmological phenomena @xcite .    despite the current theoretical ambiguity for the nature of dark energy ,",
    "the prosperous observational data ( e.g. supernova , cmb and large scale structure data and so on ) have opened a robust window for testing the recent and even early behavior of dark energy using some parameterizations for its equation of state .",
    "the recent fits to current supernova(sn ) ia data , cmb and lss@xcite find that even though the behavior of dark energy is to great extent in consistency with a cosmological constant , an evolving dark energy with the equation of state @xmath1 larger than -1 in the recent past but less than -1 today is weakly favored . if such a result holds on with the accumulation of observational data , this would be a great challenge to the current cosmology .",
    "the evolving dark energy with an equation of state @xmath1 crossing -1 during its evolution was firstly advocated and named as quintom in ref .",
    "the quintom models of dark energy are different from the quintessence or phantom in the determination of the evolution and fate of the universe . generically speaking",
    ", the phantom model has to be more fine tuned in the early epochs to serve as dark energy today , since its energy density increases with expansion of the universe .",
    "meanwhile the quintom model can also preserve the tracking behavior of quintessence , where less fine tuning is needed . the quintom model with an oscillating equation of state considered in @xcitecan lead to the oscillations of the hubble constant and a recurring universe , which in some sense unifies the early ( phantom ) inflation @xcite and current acceleration of the universe .",
    "this oscillating quintom would not lead to a big crunch nor big rip .",
    "the scale factor keeps increasing from one period to another and leads naturally to a highly flat universe . since in this model",
    "the universe recurs itself and we are only staying among one of the epochs , the coincidence problem in some sense is reconciled .",
    "ref.@xcite has considered a variation of this oscillating quintom model and studied its constraints from sn , cmb and lss .",
    "there have been some efforts made on the model building of the quintom dark energy based on field theory .",
    "first of all , a single scalar field with the canonical kinetic term ( quintessence ) or a negative kinetic term ( phantom ) will not be able to give rise to the equation of state across -1 .",
    "the similar conclusion has also been obtained for the k - essence models @xcite . beyond the single scalar field theory , refs.@xcite and @xcite",
    "have proposed an explicit model of quintom with two scalar fields , one being the quintessence and another being the phantom field .",
    "this type of model can easily lead to a scenario where at early time the quintessence dominates with @xmath2 and lately the phantom dominates with @xmath3 , satisfying current observations .",
    "some recent relevant studies are given in @xcite .",
    "the quintom model considered in refs.@xcite and @xcite does not include the interaction between the two scalars and is not the most general one . in this paper",
    ", we revisit this type of two - field quintom model by introducing a interaction term .",
    "we will study in detail the cosmological evolution of this model .",
    "in ref.@xcite it has been shown that in the two - field quintom model the scaling solution dominated by the phantom field will be a late - time attractor in the absence of the interactions . in this paper by a explicit calculation we will show the interactions do not affect the phantom - domination attractor behavior .",
    "in addition our studies also show that this class of models will provide some interesting possibilities of the evolution of the equation of state which have not been considered in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore we will propose in this paper a two - field quintom model with a scalar and a fermion which specifically we take to be the neutrinos and study its evolution of the equation of state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we study in detail the model with one quintessence and one phantom ; in section iii we present our model of quintom with a phantom and neutrinos ; section iv is our conclusion and discussions .",
    "in this section , we study a quintom model with two scalar fields , in which one is the phantom field and another is the quintessence field .",
    "the lagrangian for such a coupled system is given by = l_+l_+v_int , [ ltot]where @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the potential for the phantom field and @xmath6 with @xmath7 the potential for the quintessence field , and @xmath8 denotes the interaction between the phantom and the quintessence fields .",
    "the equation of state of this system is @xmath9    the evolution equations of the fields and the fluid for a spatially flat frw model are @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the density of fluid with a barotropic equation of state @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a constant in the range of @xmath14 .",
    "now we study the cosmological evolution of the model with lagrangian ( 1 ) .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite have considered a model where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and show that the late time behavior of this model is a phantom - domination attractor . here",
    "we introduce an interaction term @xmath17 and study its effect on the cosmological evolution .",

    "the two - field models of quintom dark energy considered above consist of two scalar fields . in the following",
    "we study a model where the quintessence in ( [ ltot ] ) is replaced by the neutrinos . in this model",
    "the neutrino will become a part of the dark energy .",
    "there have been a lot of studies recently in the literature on the coupled system of neutrinos interacting with the dark energy scalars@xcite , however in all of these studies the scalar fields have canonical kinetic terms . in the following",
    "we will show that a system with a phantom and neutrinos can naturally give rise to a realization of quintom models .",
    "furthermore since the neutrinos are the particles existing in the standard model of the elementary particle physics this model introduces less degree of freedom in comparison to the quintom model considered above with two scalar fields .",
    "the lagrangian for such a coupled system is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath5 the potential for phantom field and @xmath36 which is the kinetic term of the neutrino . in ( [ lnu ] )",
    "@xmath37 characterizes the interaction between the phantom and the neutrinos which for instance in ref.@xcite is given by [ coupl ] l_int= e^- l_ll_l h h+ h.c , where @xmath38 is the coefficient characterizing the strength of the phantom interaction with the neutrinos , @xmath39 is the scale of new physics beyond the standard model which generates the @xmath40 violation , @xmath41 are the left - handed lepton and higgs doublets respectively .",

    "this two - field quintom model of dark energy behaves differently .",
    "firstly we will analyze the general feature of the cosmological evolution for this class of models without specifying the explicit form of @xmath5 and @xmath44 . due to the existence of the interaction term @xmath44 , the evolution of the phantom field",
    "is determined by the effective potential which is the combination of the potential @xmath5 and@xcite @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 being the number density and energy of the neutrinos respectively and @xmath48 indicating the thermal average . for relativistic neutrinos , the term @xmath49 is greatly suppressed and the neutrinos and dark energy decouple . for non - relativistic neutrinos , the effective potential of the system is given by @xmath50 .",
    "consequently for the equation of motion of the scalar field @xmath51 it is @xmath52    the equation of state for such a coupled system is @xmath53 which can be rewritten as @xmath54 from the equation above one can see that during the radiation dominant period since @xmath55 is much larger than @xmath56 , @xmath1 of the coupled system will be around 1/3 and in the matter dominant regime @xmath1 will be close to 0 . however in the late time when the phantom energy dominant over neutrinos @xmath57 , @xmath1 gradually evolves into the value smaller than -1 . to illustrate this behavior in fig .",
    "4 we plot the evolution of the equation of state @xmath1 of a model where @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in the numerical calculation",
    "we have taken that @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "one can see from this figure that @xmath1 changes from above -1 to below -1 as the redshift decreases .     for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ]    .",
    "in this paper we have studied theoretically the possibility of building the two - field dark energy model with an equation of state across -1 . in general within the framework of the general relativity and the field theory ,",
    "it is difficult to realize the quintom with a single scalar field model . thus two fields are required . in models with two scalar fields",
    "there will be a lot of possibilities for the model building by choosing the potentials , interactions and the model parameters . as shown in figs . 2 and 3 the physics associated with this type of models and their implications in cosmology are quite rich .",
    "in the model with phantom and neutrinos , as we emphasized in the paper since the neutrinos are the particles existing in the standard model of the elementary particle physics , compared with the model with two scalar fields this model introduces less degree of freedom .",
    "furthermore the neutrino masses vary during the evolution of the phantom field , which makes this model more interesting . before concluding we should also point out that there exist possibilities of building models of dark energy with equation of state across -1 beyond the field theory with minimal couplings to the gravity and the four dimension@xcite .",
