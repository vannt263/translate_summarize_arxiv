    "it is well - known that complex quantum systems with a discrete energy spectrum ( i.e. , an atom in an external electric field ) can be placed in a special dynamical configuration in which only two stationary states are essential . in those cases",
    "the description of a system s evolution does not require a consideration of the entire hilbert space .",
    "a good approximation is achieved in case the whole hilbert space is replaced by a two - dimensional linear space .",
    "systems of this kind are called two - level systems , whose evolution is governed by a special system of two differential equations , known as the `` spin equation '' .",
    "the spin equation arises in many areas of theoretical physics and thus finds a wide range of applications , for instance , the semi - classical theory of laser beams @xcite , the absorption resonance and nuclear induction experiments @xcite , the behavior of a molecule in a cavity immersed in electric or magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "particularly , we would like to stress the importance of the spin equation in view of its possible applications to quantum computations @xcite .",
    "the first exact solution of the spin equation was obtained by rabi rabi .",
    "this solution found an extensive physical application in the study of various properties of two - level systems .",
    "this fact shows a great importance of exactly solvable models involving the spin equation . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "some general properties of the spin equation were studied .",
    "the authors of @xcite  give an overview of the known results and obtain new classes of exact solutions to this equation . among the methods of analysis of exactly solvable spin equations , the method of intertwining operators",
    "@xcite@xcite plays a special role , since it reveals a new type of symmetry related with two - level systems shamshutdinova , czjp , called the polynomial pseudo - supersymmetry .    in this respect , we would like to remind that the ideas and methods of supersymmetry ( susy ) are recently coming into use in relativistic and nonrelativistic quantum - mechanical problems .",
    "supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) , originated from the simplest quantum field model in connection with the problem of a spontaneous susy breaking @xcite , finds more and more extensive applications in theoretical physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it was discovered that diverse aspects of susy qm are closely related with the method of darboux transformations , well - known in the soliton theory @xcite .",
    "numerous works are devoted to the relation between susy qm and the technique of intertwining operators cooper , nieto .",
    "this article is a continuation of a previous works devoted to the study of exact solutions of two - level systems and the peculiarities related to the corresponding underlying supersymmetry @xcite@xcite .",
    "our main objective is to show that a repeated use of simple transformations introduced in the above papers gives rise to a wide range of exactly solvable interactions for the spin equation .",
    "it turns out that such a study is convenient in the analysis of equations describing two - level systems written in the form of a one - dimensional stationary dirac equation with a non - hermitian hamiltonian of a special form , in which time plays the role of a spatial variable @xcite . in this respect",
    ", we can mention that non - hermitian interaction arises , in particular , in various problems of field theory , statistical mechanics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and nuclear physics . in connection with the discovery of a large class of complex potentials possessing the so - called @xmath1-symmetry ( see , e.g. , cannata ) , which often leads to hamiltonians with a purely real spectrum , recently an attempt was made once again to construct a complex extension of quantum mechanics @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "it is worth mentioning the paper @xcite , where the authors show that the use of non - hermitian ( so - called quasi - hermitian ) operators does not contradict the basic principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "it should also be noted that such a generalization was not started from scratch , and , in fact , partially goes back to classical works @xcite .    in this respect , the role of supersymmetry in quantum mechanics may increase @xcite , since , as was recently shown , susy transformations allow one to remove singular points from continuous spectra of non - hermitian hamiltonians @xcite , and to convert non - diagonalizable hamiltonians into diagonalizable ones @xcite .",
    "this may enlarge the set of admissible super - hamiltonians , thus giving an opportunity to extend the theory by new types of interaction .",
    "in @xcite it was shown how to construct matrix - differential intertwining operators preserving the special form of a non - hermitian dirac hamiltonian , and in @xcite some results were announced related to transformation chains .",
    "the technique of simple ( first - order in derivatives ) intertwining operators adapted to the special case of rabi oscillations made it possible to discover an interesting physical effect @xcite .",
    "namely , as distinct form a constant field frequency when the probability to populate the excited level oscillates with time ( rabi oscillations ) , there exist such types of time dependence of the field frequency that this probability ceases to oscillate and becomes a monotonously increasing function of time tending to a value which may exceed @xmath0 ( in particular , it may be equal to @xmath2 @xcite ) .",
    "this property gives the hope that inverse population may be observed in an ensemble of two - level atoms placed in such type of field , and they may exhibit lasing properties .",
    "this result was obtained when a single darboux transformation was applied to a two - level atom .",
    "one of the aims of the present work is a detailed analysis of the above - mentioned transformation chains . in order to make this work",
    "self - contained , we show first of all ( see the following section ) how the schrdinger equation for a two - level atom interacting in the rotating wave approximation with the electric component of an electromagnetic field can be reduced to a one - dimensional stationary dirac equation with an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian where time plays the role of a spatial variable .",
    "this is accomplished for a general time - dependence of the field frequency .",
    "the third section is devoted to supersymmetric constructions .",
    "it is shown that the transformation chains introduced in @xcite are related with a polynomial pseudo - supersymmetry of the system .",
    "this fact indicates the presence of this type of symmetry in a two - level atom .",
    "the introductory part of the fourth section contains a brief review of previous results which are required in the following sections .",
    "it is shown that in the case of various factorization constants the use of formulas similar to the crum ",
    "krein formulas @xcite for the schrdinger equation permits us to express the potential , obtained as a result of an @xmath3-fold susy transformation , through @xmath3-order determinants of the transformation functions , thus avoiding the use of recurrent formulas , which require the knowledge of solutions at all the intermediary steps .",
    "we obtain the form of transformation functions that preserves both the specific matrix structure of the initial potential and its real - valued character .",
    "we also study the case of coinciding factorization constants and obtain a sufficiently simple realization of such transformation chains .    as a numerical application of our general scheme , in the final ( fifth ) section",
    "we examine a two - fold transformation for a two - level atom in an external electromagnetic field .",
    "we discover that in this case the disappearance of oscillations in the time - dependence of the probability to populate the excited level may also occur , i.e. , at certain conditions this probability may acquire a monotonous time - dependence .",
    "it is established that , in contrast to the previously published results @xcite , this effect emerges for two kinds of behavior of the detuning of the external field frequency from the resonance value . in these cases , the probability values to populate the excited level after a two - fold transformation",
    "coincide with either the maximal or the minimal values of the probability oscillations obtained as a result of a one - fold transformation .",
    "since the results obtained in this paper are mainly applied to a two - level atom in an external electromagnetic field , in this section we briefly review some properties of this system which are required in the following sections .    in the non - relativistic approximation ,",

    "we have found shamshutdinova that the rabi oscillations after a one - fold transformation disappear for @xmath244 . in this case , the general solution of equation ( [ chi0 ] ) is a linear function of time , @xmath245 , which in the case @xmath246 yields the following expression for the function @xmath247 : @xmath248 .",
    "the potential after the one - fold transformation reads@xmath249let us make the next transformation with @xmath166 . the function @xmath156 is found from ( [ qn ] ) at @xmath228 , where @xmath250 is determined by formulas ( [ chi2])-([tildechi2 ] ) . using ( [ f2 ] ) , we get the following expression for the transformed potential : @xmath251where @xmath252 is a constant .",
    "let us determine the form of the external electric field @xmath253 $ ] corresponding to the potential @xmath254 ( [ f22 ] ) .",
    "we may observe an interesting feature of the behavior of @xmath255 with time . from ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ f ] )",
    ", it follows that the frequency @xmath256 is expressed through the function @xmath257 as follows : @xmath258 in general , the field @xmath255 is an oscillating function with the amplitude @xmath259 ( see fig .",

    "for instance , substituting in ( f22 ) @xmath264 and @xmath265 we obtain for @xmath266 @xmath267thus , for @xmath268 the field @xmath50 becomes the polynomial@xmath269plotted in fig.2 .",
    "another interesting effect has been observed for a one - fold transformation @xcite .",
    "it consists in the disappearance of oscillations in the time - dependence of the excited level population .",
    "for a two - fold transformation , there are additional possibilities for observing this property",
    ".    solutions of the initial problem for @xmath270 are known shamshutdinova .",
    "having constructed the transformation operator by using ( [ l01 ] ) and ( [ l12 ] ) , we find the solutions @xmath271 and @xmath272 of the set of equations after the second step of transformation .",
    "note that the normalization of solutions changes as a result of the transformation @xmath273 . imposing on the solutions the initial conditions @xmath274 and @xmath275 we determine the probability to populate the excited level after a two - fold transformation .",
    "the expression for the probability is rather involved and we will not present it here .",
    "we merely note that this quantity oscillates with time due to the presence of trigonometric functions .",
    "let us consider the case @xmath264 in more detail .",
    "it turns out that under the condition @xmath276the oscillations in the time dependence of the probability disappear and it acquires a monotonous character:@xmath277therefore , according to ( [ condit ] ) , as distinct from one - fold transformations , for two - fold transformations we can indicate two possibilities , @xmath278 and @xmath279 , which transform the probability to populate the excited level from an oscillating function of time to a monotonous one .",
    "the plots of probability in these cases are given by figs .",
    "3 and 4 ( thick lines ) .",
    "we observe another interesting effect by plotting simultaneously the probability to populate the excited level before the transformation and after the first and second transformation steps .",
    "5 presents the probability plots for a particular value of the parameter @xmath280 , which corresponds to the case when the probability of population resulting from the one - fold transformation is described by a monotonous function @xcite @xmath281the thick line presents the plot of probability ( [ p1 ] ) .",
    "its maximal value coincides with the probability before the transformation , i.e. , with the probability for the usual rabi oscillations ( the dotted line ) .",
    "the thin line presents the probability resulting from a chain of two transformations .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "5 that the oscillations in this case are in antiphase with the rabi oscillations .    returning to figs . 3 and 4 ,",
    "note that they also present the plots for @xmath282 and @xmath283 , respectively . for such values of @xmath284",
    "the probability to populate the excited level after the two - fold transformation becomes a monotonous function and for @xmath285 the probability values after the second transformation ( the thick line ) coincide with either the maxima or the minima of probability oscillations resulting from the one - fold transformation ( the thin line ) .",
    "the probability before the transformation ( the dotted line ) oscillates in this case in phase with the probability after the one - fold transformation .    omitting the details ,",
    "let us consider the behavior of the probability to populate the excited level obtained as a result of a two - fold transformation with different factorization constants .",
    "the transformed potential @xmath160 is obtained in @xcite @xmath286 -r_{1}\\left [ b_{1}^{2}-\\left ( b_{1}^{\\ast } \\right ) ^{2}\\right ] } { %    & b_{k}=\\frac{u_{k}}{\\tilde{u}_{k}}=\\frac{1-iq_{k}}{1+iq_{k}}\\;,\\quad k=1,2\\ , .",
    "\\label{f222}\\end{aligned}\\]]using ( [ phij ] ) and ( [ pje ] ) , we construct the intertwining operator @xmath287 and then apply it to find solutions @xmath288 and @xmath289 of equation ( [ h0 ] ) with potential ( [ f222 ] ) . in terms of the functions",
    "@xmath290 the operator @xmath291 is written as @xmath292where @xmath293let@xmath294acting by @xmath291 on solutions of the initial problem ( [ h0 ] ) , we obtain its solutions for @xmath295 .",
    "imposing on these solutions the initial conditions @xmath296 and @xmath297 , we determine the probability to populate the excited level after a two - fold transformation .",
    "in general , the behavior of probability has an oscillating character .",
    "it is important to note that we now observe two kinds of oscillations : small - amplitude and large - frequency ( fast ) oscillations occur at the background of a large amplitude and small frequency ( slow ) oscillations ( see fig .",
    "furthermore , at certain values of parameters , the probability for fast oscillations changes within a narrow range ( on fig . 6 between @xmath298 and @xmath299 ) with the maximal value close to unity .",
    "this behavior of probability continues for a long time ( on fig .",
    "6 for approximately @xmath300 time units that we use ) .",
    "however , the time during which the probability of a transition to an exited state is less than @xmath301 ( in the present case it approximately is equal to @xmath302 ) is less than the indicated interval by several orders of units ( approximately two units in the current case ) .",
    "this means that in the course of time the most part of two - level atoms are found in the excited state , which may lead to the appearance of an inverse population , as well as to a possible appearance of the lasing property of an ensemble of two - level atoms placed in such kind of field .",
    "we have considered chains of susy transformations for the spin equation , with an application to a two - level atom in an external electromagnetic field with a possible time - dependence of the field frequency .",
    "it is shown that when a chain of @xmath3 transformations is replaced by a single @xmath3-fold transformation one can construct a super - hamiltonian and supercharges which close a polynomial superalgebra .",
    "this fact permits us to state that a polynomial pseudo - supersymmetry can be associated with a physical system , being a two - level atom in the present case .",
    "it is discovered that , as a result of a two - fold transformation , a certain type of time behavior of the field frequency implies the disappearance of time oscillations of the population probability for the excited level , and the probability becomes a monotonously growing function of time with the limiting value which can exceed @xmath0 .",
    "this feature permits us to suppose that an ensemble of two - level atoms placed in this specific electromagnetic field may acquire an inverse population and exhibit lasing properties .",
