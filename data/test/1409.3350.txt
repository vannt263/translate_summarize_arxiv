    "challenging questions appear often at edges of traditional fields . as an example , the new branch of mathematical physics , the `` statistical topology '' emerged recently by absorbing ideas from the statistical physics , theory of integrable systems , and algebraic topology ( see , @xcite for review ) .",
    "the scope of the statistical topology includes , on the one hand , mathematical problems involved in the construction of topological invariants of knots and links based on solvable models and , on the other hand , the physical and statistical problems related to summation over knot ensembles . in this work , we dwell predominantly to problems of the latter kind , demonstrating the emergence of a critical behavior in ensemble of @xmath0 torus knots .",
    "this critical behavior is formulated in terms of knot invariants .",
    "torus knots @xmath3 seem to be among the simplest objects in the knot theory .",
    "it is difficult to overestimate their role in different branches of mathematical physics .",
    "the topology of a torus knot is uniquely determined by the pair @xmath4 , which fixes windings along two torus periods . in the fig.[fig:01 ] few particular examples of torus knots , @xmath5 from the series @xmath0 are depicted .",
    "the closed curves wrap around the torus which is not shown .    :",
    "@xmath5.,width=302 ]    various explicit expressions for knot invariants are known , ranging from classical jones ",
    "kauffman polynomials @xcite , to recent superpolynomials of torus knots @xcite .",
    "new approaches to the construction of torus knot invariants for particular knots , based on the application of topological string theories and deformed matrix models , have been formulated relatively recently in @xcite .",
    "much less is known about properties of _ knot ensembles _ , where the particular topology of a knot diagram is considered as a topologically `` quenched '' variable similar to the quenched disorder in statistical physics .",
    "the weighted summation over different torus knot types ( i.e. different pairs @xmath4 ) means the consideration of the grand canonical ensemble ( i.e. of the generating function ) of torus knots .    in this work",
    "we uncover the relation between three physical problems : i ) two - dimensional directed ( i.e. ( 1 + 1)-dimensional ) lattice random walks with fixed area under the curve , ii ) ensemble of @xmath0 torus knots , and iii ) a five - dimensional sqed with the chern ",
    "simons term at the level one .",
    "the reason for random walks to appear in ii ) and iii ) can be intuitively explained as follows .",
    "the main tool for the evaluation of the torus knot superpolynomials @xcite and of nekrasov partition function in the susy gauge theory @xcite , is the `` equivariant localization '' approach , which reduces the integral over the particular moduli space to the summation over the young tableau .",
    "the last problem can be reformulated as a weighted sums over directed paths on a square lattice .",
    "the schematic relations between the problems considered in the paper is shown in the flowchart in the fig.[fig:02 ] .",
    "our main goal is the investigation of the critical behavior in these topological ensembles . from the `` random walk side ''",
    "the critical behavior occurs in the space of fugacities and we shall focus at the `` area+length+corners '' statistics of paths .",
    "we derive an explicit expression for the free energy in the random walks problem for the `` area+length+corners '' statistics , which provides the very nontrivial phase structure in the three - dimensional space of fugacities . in the generic case",
    "we find a cascade of phase transitions and in the degenerate cases we reproduce the previously known results .",
    "the relation between the random walks and the torus knot superpolynomials can be traced from the mathematical literature , however the relation with the particular observable in 5d sqed instanton ensemble is new . collecting different points of view , and the results of @xcite , we interpret the generating function of ensemble of @xmath0 knots as the weighted sum of instanton contributions to the particular observable in 5d sqed and analyze the structure of corresponding generating function .",
    "the interpretation of the random walk fugacities in terms of the generating parameters in the torus knot ensemble is quite straightforward , moreover , these fugacities are identified in the 5d sqed as well : the corresponding parameters turn out to be the gauge coupling , the mass of the hypermultiplet , and the parameters of the @xmath1-deformation .    given an explicit expression for the free energy in the random walks problem for the `` area+length+corners '' statistics , we use it to analyze the ensembles of knots and instantons .",
    "we show that at the `` gauge theory side '' the particular third derivative of the instanton partition function with respect to the masses exhibits an unexpected critical behavior at some critical line in the space of parameters .",
    "we provide a physical interpretation of critical behaviors in all three theories considered here . having an exact expression for the @xmath2-narayana numbers ( the generating function of the area- and corner - weighted ( 1 + 1)d brownian excursion ) , we describe explicitly the phase portrait of different ensembles .",
    "we show that there is a 3rd order phase transition in the instanton ensemble , corresponding to the 1st order phase transition in the ensembles of random paths and torus knots .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section 2",
    "we describe the sum over the paths with different statistics and focus at the `` area+length+corners '' ensembles . in the section 3",
    "we discuss the representation of the partition function of ( 1 + 1)d brownian excursions ( dyck paths ) for the superpolynomials of @xmath0 torus knots .",
    "the section 4 is devoted to the identification of the sum over the paths as the instanton contribution to the particular observable in the 5d sqed . in the section 5 we consider the physical interpretation of the critical behavior in the space of fugacities in all models discussed at length of the paper .",
    "the relation with the toda - like integrable system is mentioned in section 6 .",
    "our findings and the open questions are summarized in the conclusion . in the appendix",
    "a , using the combinatorial description , we derive the new explicit expression for the generating function of @xmath6-narayana polynomials ( the generating function of area- and corner - weighted dyck paths ) . in the appendix b we remind for completeness the relation of the critical behavior with the `` hydrodynamic description '' of the edge singularities in gue matrix ensembles .",
    "by definition , the dyck path of length @xmath7 on the square lattice starts at the origin @xmath8 , ends at point @xmath9 and consists of the union of sequential elementary `` @xmath10 '' and `` @xmath11 '' steps , such that the path always stays above the diagonal of the square  see the fig.[fig:03 ] .",

    "we focus on the be representation and provide a dictionary identifying the fugacities at be side with the ones at the knot side .",
    "this dictionary establishes the translation of the be language to the language of torus knot superpolynomials .",
    "the construction of torus knot invariants involves two more statistics for dyck paths , the statistics of `` up - corners '' , where the path changes direction from `` up '' ( @xmath10 ) to `` right '' ( @xmath11 ) , and the statistics of `` dinv '' , a definition for which can be found in @xcite .",
    "the superpolynomial for @xmath0 knots expressed in terms of dyck paths can be presented by the following partition function : z_n(q , t , a ) = _ _ ndyck  paths q^a t^#dinv a^#corners , [ eq:1 ] where @xmath2 , @xmath25 and @xmath72 are the fugacities of area , corners and dinv correspondingly .",

    "as before , the area , dinv , and corner statistics in the ensemble of lattice paths are represented by the corresponding fugacities in the grand ensemble . to use the known critical behavior for the generating function of superpolynomials in the ensemble of torus knots , we have to consider the reduction of paths statistics to the `` length+area+corners '' one , switching off the `` dinv '' fugacity ( i.e. setting @xmath73 in ( [ eq:1 ] ) ) .",

    "we explain the relation between the generating function for the torus knot superpolynomials and the some observables in the 5d sqed upon the particular identification of parameters . in the section 6",
    "we shall use the generating function for @xmath2-narayanas to analyze the critical behavior in the torus knots ensembles classified by the homfly knot invariants .",

    "the nekrasov partition function is trivial in this theory , however we shall be interested in the vacuum matrix element @xmath79 of the particular operator @xmath80 .",
    "its evaluation involves the weighted sum of the integrals over the instanton moduli space , where the parameters of the @xmath1background , @xmath81 , serve as the equivariant parameters of two torus actions for the integration over the moduli space , @xmath82 , of @xmath16 point - like instantons , all located at the origin .",

    "the desired operator @xmath80 can be identified as follows .",
    "first , we have to recognize the deformed catalan numbers , @xmath86 , with @xmath79 in the @xmath16instanton sector .",
    "to this aim we use the following important result @xcite ^t(hilb^n(c^2,0 ) , v ^n v ) = c_n(q , t ) , which interprets the @xmath76-deformed catalans as equivariant integrals over the moduli space of @xmath16abelian instantons valued in the @xmath16th power of the @xmath16dimensional tautological bundle , @xmath87 .",
    "looking at the representation of the @xmath76catalans in terms of the paths on the young tableau , the desired operator , up to the normalization , can be written in the @xmath16instanton sector as o _",

    "it is more convenient to use the equivalent , however a bit more symmetric formulation of the desired observable in 5d sqed @xcite .",
    "consider the 5d qed with two flavors in the fundamental representation with masses @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and the flavor in the antifundamental representation with a mass @xmath94 .",
    "the following relation between the second derivative of the nekrasov partition function and the generating function for the @xmath0 knot superpolynomials , holds : @xmath95 this is equivalent to the evaluation of the correlator of local and nonlocal operators defined above due to the relation .",
    "|_m = ( tr e^ ) , we keep the parameter @xmath25 in the superpolynomial arbitrary , hence the complete list of the identifications reads as follows a=- e^-m_a , t = e^-_1 , q = e^-_2 thus , as above , we have the generating function depending on four fugacities .",
    "the relation between the derivative of the nekrasov partition function and torus knots superpolynomials is important per se , however in this paper we are focusing at the critical behavior in the topological ensembles .",
    "therefore , what we need is i ) the identification of the parameters of the gauge theory as the fugacities of the random walk , and ii ) expression of the generating function for the @xmath2-narayana numbers . to make use the known expression for @xmath2-narayana s",
    ", we have to switch off one equivariant parameter , @xmath96 .",
    "the critical behavior is now the @xmath97phase space , and in this formulation it is clear that we are dealing with the 3rd order phase transition . however , the new point is that the 3rd derivative of the nekrasov partition function is taken with respect to three distinct variables @xmath98 ( or , equivalently , to @xmath99 ) . the physical interpretation of the critical behavior is given in the next section .",
    "in this section we discuss the physical interpretation of the critical behavior found above .",
    "as we have already argued , the critical behavior is exact due to the explicit expression of the generating function for @xmath2-narayana s , which depends on three fugacities ( chemical potentials ) controlling length of the path , area under the path and corners .",
    "the interpretations of the fugacities and of the critical behavior are different at brownian excursion side , knot side , and 5d sqed side , so we consider them separately .",
    "however , these seemingly different critical behaviors reflect one and the same generic pattern of the phase transition .      in terms of the ( 1 + 1)d",
    "random walks the critical behavior in the @xmath100 space has the following interpretation . in the limit @xmath101",
    "the fugacity of the area is switched off and we deal with the generating function @xmath48 ( see ( [ eq : nar ] ) ) defined in the @xmath102plane . at large finite lengths , @xmath16 , the average number of corners , @xmath103 diverges with the length , @xmath16 , as @xmath104 .",

    "naively , different behavior of the generating function at different ridges of the transition point , means different ability to recognize a particular knot in the ensemble .",
    "speaking more formally , we could try to distinguish phases via the derivatives of the generating function with respect to the particular generating parameters , that is the average values of the corresponding `` topological numbers '' .",

    "the physics of the phase transitions at this critical line for the ensembles of torus knots and instantons is very rich . in both cases at the critical line",
    "the contribution to the quantity under consideration with the infinitely large topological number starts to dominate .",
    "these quantities are windings in the knot case , or topological charges in the 5d sqed . in the gauge theory",
    "we have the critical lines in the ( gauge coupling , mass ) parameter plane .",
    "the phase transition in this plane is physically meaningful and certainly deserved detailed investigation .",
    "even more profound behavior is seen when all three fugacities are nontrivial .",
    "the critical cascades are quite unexpected and physically they take place in the unrefined limit of the @xmath1deformed gauge theory . at the knot side ,",
    "the critical behavior occurs in the generating function of the @xmath0 knots characterized by the homfly polynomials .",
    "the following general comment is in order .",
    "one has to distinguish two `` critical phenomena '' : phase transition and the wall  crossing phenomena .",
    "the latter is typical for the supersymmetric gauge theories when the spectrum of bps states jumps at some curves and surfaces in the moduli space . upon the susy breaking , the curves of marginal stability become the curves of phase transitions . hence literally the wall - crossing should not be considered as a phase transition , since only the spectrum of the stable bps states gets rearranged .",
    "however , there is a pattern of real phase transitions , even in susy theory , with the argyres ",
    "douglas superconformal point in sqcd as the notable example . in this case",
    "the particular condensates serve as the order parameter .",
    "do we deal with the phase transition or with the wall - crossing phenomena in our case ?",
    "formally , the 3rd derivative of the nekrasov partition function in 5d sqed diverges , hence we could speak about the 3rd order phase transition in the instanton ensemble . moreover , the uv properties of the condensate play the key role , and critical lines involve the hypermultiplet masses and the gauge coupling . hence , we could speak on some similarity with the argyres ",
    "douglas scenario . on the other hand , at the torus knot side , we could remind the interpretation of the knot superpolynomial as the index of the bps states in some theory .",
    "hence the jump in the index is better interpreted in terms of wall - crossing . as far as we know , there is no evident notion of the wall - crossing in terms of random walks , however , we cold think about it in terms of the stokes lines in quantum mechanics .",
    "summarizing , we think that the critical behavior we have described , admits the interpretation both as the wall - crossing , and as the phase transition , depending on the viewpoint .    the critical behavior we have considered in 5d sqed is a nontrivial example of the 3rd order phase transition .",
    "the familiar example of the 3rd order phase transition in the gauge theories is the phase transition of douglas  kazakov type @xcite in 2d pure yang - mills theory on the sphere characterized by the singularity ( [ eq : asymp1 ] ) . somewhat similar phase transition of douglas  kazakov type has been observed in @xcite . in all these situations",
    "the phase transitions are driven by instantons .",
    "on the other hand , our study , as well as @xcite , yield the clear relation between the torus knots and instantons .",
    "this suggests more general viewpoint that there is a knotting process behind the 3rd order phase transitions in the general case and the knot invaraints play the role similar to the central charges of the virasoro algebra in the 2nd order phase transitions .",
    "we shall provide the general discussion of the 3rd order phase transition in the gauge theories , knot ensembles and statistical mechanics elsewhere @xcite .",
    "there are many challenging issues , related to our work , which deserve further study .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to extend the analysis to the whole ensemble of @xmath66 torus knots and the whole set of fugacities .",
    "also , it would be important to recognize the counterparts of the `` bounces '' and `` corners '' in the particle path integral in the continuum ( i.e. off lattice ) and obtain the interpretation of the external magnetic field in the be approach as a kind of the berry curvature from a 4d viewpoint",
    ". it would be also very interesting to extend our consideration and to relate the spectrum of the full ( i.e. non - chiral ) hofstadter model at be side with knot invariants and 4d instantons .",
    "we plan to address all these questions in @xcite .",
    "it seems also very important to recognize the critical behavior observed in this paper in the ensembles of branes @xcite , hopfions @xcite and `` ensemble '' of 3d theories classified by the torus knots @xcite .",
    "another interesting question concerns the physical interpretation of the critical behavior in terms of the extended objects involved in the torus knot description along the discussion in @xcite .",
