    "atomic coherence is essential for a proper understanding of many important effects appearing in the response of an atomic system to strong laser radiation .",
    "perhaps the mollow spectrum  @xcite for a strongly driven two - level atom has been the first milestone in quantum optics where atomic coherence plays a major role .",
    "once the population dynamics in two - level systems was understood , the interest in multilevel ( and , especially , three - level ) atoms became soon apparent .",
    "a significant amount of research has thus been devoted to their study and many effects based on quantum coherence such as spectroscopic dark states  @xcite , electron shelving  @xcite , narrow spectral lines  @xcite , pulse matching  @xcite , and anti - intuitive excitation  @xcite , have been highlighted .",
    "these nonclassical features have an enormous variety of interesting and nontrivial consequences , including electromagnetically induced transparency  @xcite , lasing without inversion  @xcite , state - selective molecular excitation  @xcite , and demonstrations of slow light  @xcite and fast light  @xcite to mention only a few examples .    for a three - level atom",
    "coupled to one or two quantized cavity field modes both the atomic dynamics and the statistical properties of the reemitted field have been discussed in detail  @xcite showing interesting phenomena , the most outstanding being , perhaps , the existence of collapses and revivals .",
    "the phase properties of this model have also been studied , mainly using the pegg - barnett formalism for the field , and the connection between revivals and phase has been put forward  @xcite .    in spite of these achievements ,",
    "even a cursory look at any classical model of atom - field interaction immediately reveals that the natural way of understanding the resonant behavior is in terms of the relative phase between the field and the atomic dipole .",
    "it is also clear that this relative phase is basic in the treatment of concepts such as interference or coherence that are ubiquituous in classical optics .",
    "however , when one tries to extend this variable into the quantum domain one is immediately faced with two serious problems : first , there is no precise prescription to deal with the phase of a three - level atom  @xcite ; second , we lack a satisfactory description of the atom - field interaction in terms of relative phase .",
    "the main goal of this paper is precisely to remedy these drawbacks by proposing a comprehensive theory of the relative phase for three - level atoms interacting with quantum fields .",
    "phase for three - level systems has been handled by invoking fuzzy concepts such as the phase of the associated wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that these notions , though well established in the classical limit , are not easily extrapolated into the realm of the quantum world .",
    "since phase is considered to be a physical property , in the orthodox picture of quantum mechanics it must be associated with a selfadjoint operator or at least with a family of positive operator - valued measures  @xcite . in this",
    "spirit , phase operators for the algebra su(2 ) , which describes two - level systems , have been previously worked out  @xcite . since su(3 ) is the natural arena in which to deal with three - level atoms , we propose here an extension enabling us to introduce phase operators for these systems with a clear physical picture .    concerning the aforementioned second problem ,",
    "we stress that an operator describing the relative phase between field and atoms has resisted a quantum description  @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "its role has been played by the field quadratures  @xcite , which in many respects properly account for phase relations and are free from the difficulties that phase encounters in the quantum domain . when focusing on the relative phase between two subsystems , we think the best way to proceed , much in the spirit of our previous work on the subject  @xcite , is to try a polar decomposition of the quantum amplitudes that parallels as much as possible the corresponding classical factorization .",
    "for the relative phase between two quantum field modes this is quite a straightforward procedure and leads to a unitary solution  @xcite . for the case at hand",
    ", this polar decomposition seems to be more involved , mainly because , unlike for the case of two harmonic oscillators , the hamiltonian can not be cast in terms of su(3 ) generators , but rather in terms of a polynomial deformation of su(3 ) .",
    "these nonlinear algebras have been examined very recently in quite different physical contexts  @xcite . without embarking on mathematical subtleties",
    ", we shall exploit these previous results to perform the polar decomposition in an elegant way , obtaining a bona fide hermitian operator representing the relative phase we wish to examine .",
    "it is our firm belief that this hermitian operator and its eigenstates should be a fundamental tool for examining all the issues related with quantum interference between atomic pathways .",
    "this leads to coherent effects as those mentioned earlier . in this paper",
    "we use this operator to introduce its associated probability distribution and to explain some relevant dynamical features of the model .",
    "nevertheless we stress that given the variety of phenomena of both conceptual and practical importance arising in this field , it is outside the scope of this paper to provide a full account of them .",
    "rather , our goal is to emphasize the role that the relative phase plays in atom - field interactions , a role that has previously gone almost unnoticed .",
    "we wish to explore in some detail the phase properties of a three - level system . to be specific we shall consider a @xmath0 configuration , as shown in fig .  1 , with energy levels @xmath1 ( we shall use throughout all this paper units @xmath2 ) and with allowed dipole transitions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , but not @xmath5 .    in order to describe the kinematics of this system one must take into account that the natural generalization of the bloch vector  @xcite ( which is essential in understanding the behavior of a two - level system ) comprises now the nine operators @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the eigenstate of the @xmath8th atomic level",
    "one can easily check that they satisfy @xmath9 =   \\delta_{il } \\hat{s}^{kj } -\\delta_{kj } \\hat{s}^{il }   , \\ ] ] which correspond to the commutation relations of the algebra u(3 )  @xcite .    obviously , the three `` diagonal '' operators @xmath10 measure level populations , while the `` off - diagonal '' ladder operators @xmath11 generate transitions from level @xmath8 to level @xmath12 . to emphasize this idea",
    "we define raising and lowering operators by @xmath13    because one has the trivial constraint @xmath14 , only two populations can vary independently . for this reason ,",
    "it is customary to introduce two independent traceless operators @xmath15 that measure atomic inversions between the corresponding levels .",
    "the operators @xmath16 ( @xmath17 turn out to be the eight generators of the algebra su(3 ) . note that @xmath18 and @xmath19 form two su(2 ) subalgebras that physically correspond to the two dipoles that appear in the two allowed transitions @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "however , these two dipoles are not independent , since eq .",
    "( [ ccr3 ] ) imposes @xmath20= - \\hat{s}_+^{12 } , \\qquad [ \\hat{s}_+^{13 } , \\hat{s}_+^{23 } ] = 0 , \\ ] ] which constitutes a highly nontrivial coupling between them .",
    "it is usual to take for granted the existence of the phase of the atomic dipoles , mainly because classically one has a clear picture of their meaning .",
    "however , strictly speaking , we do not have any prescription to deal with this variable at the quantum level . nevertheless , as anticipated in the introduction",
    ", one could expect to get a formalism very close to the one developed recently for two - level systems .    for definiteness let us first focus on the transition @xmath3 .",
    "if only these two levels were involved , such a transition would be described by a superposition of the form @xmath21 this corresponds to a 1/2 angular - momentum system .",
    "for this case  @xcite the bloch vector is @xmath22 , @xmath23 being the pauli matrices , and it is easy to work out that the mean values @xmath24 are given by @xmath25 this would support the naive belief that , when viewed in the bloch sphere @xmath26 , the parameter @xmath27 is the phase angle associated with the atomic dipole @xmath3 and is canonically conjugate to @xmath28  @xcite . in consequence , there is a widespread usage of dealing with this dipole phase @xmath27 as a state parameter instead of a quantum variable . to gain further insight into this point , let us note that @xmath29 so it is clear that the parameter  dipole phase \" can be obtained through the decomposition of @xmath30 in terms of modulus and phase .",
    "obviously , it is tempting to pursue this simple picture by taking into account that , at the operator level , the equivalent to the decomposition in terms of modulus and phase is a polar decomposition .",
    "thus , it seems appropriate to define the operator counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ s- ] ) in the three - level case we are considering as @xmath31 here @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the hermitian operator representing the phase of the transition .",
    "one can work out that the unitary solution of eq .",
    "( [ polar ] ) may be written as @xmath34 where the undefined factor @xmath35 appears due to the unitarity requirement of @xmath36 .",
    "the main features of this operator are largely independent of @xmath37 , but for the sake of concreteness , we can make a definite choice . for example",
    "@xcite , if we assume a state such as the linear superposition ( [ qubit ] ) , the complex conjugation of the wavefunction should reverse the sign of @xmath33 , which immediately leads to the condition @xmath38 .",
    "we conclude then that the operator we are looking for can be represented as @xmath39 the associated eigenstates are @xmath40 and the eigenvalues of @xmath33 are 0 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "this is a remarkable result .",
    "it shows that the eigenvectors @xmath42 look like the standard ones for a quantum dipole or a spin 1/2 .",
    "however , the `` spectator '' level @xmath43 ( i.e. , it apparently does not take part in the transition ) is an eigenstate of this operator , which introduces drastic changes in the dynamics . in other words ,",
    "the phase of the transition @xmath3  feels \" the state @xmath43 .",
    "perhaps , the most striking feature of this theory is that a measurement of the phase of the transition gives only three possible values : 0 and @xmath41 . while this kind of statement seems rather reasonable when dealing with spin systems ,",
    "they are scarcely recognized when dealing with atoms .    an analogous reasoning for the transition @xmath4",
    "gives the corresponding operator @xmath44 @xmath45 with eigenvectors @xmath46 and the same eigenvalues as before .",
    "note that @xmath47 which clearly displays the quantum nature of this phase .    to any smooth function @xmath48 of the dipole phase @xmath49",
    "we can associate the operator @xmath50 where the sum runs over the eigenvalues 0 and @xmath41 .",
    "the mean value of this operator function can be computed as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the probability distribution @xmath53 , \\ ] ] for any state described by the density matrix @xmath54 .",
    "we shall make use of these results in next section .",
    "to maintain the discussion as self contained as possible we briefly review the basic aspects of the interaction of a three - level atom with a two - mode field .",
    "we shall merely outline what will be essential for our later discussion of phase properties .",
    "we write the hamiltonian for this system as @xmath55 where @xmath56 here @xmath57 describes the dynamics of the free atom and @xmath58 represents the cavity modes of frequency @xmath59 and @xmath60 , with annihilation operators @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . finally , in the interaction term @xmath63 , written in the dipole and rotating - wave approximations",
    ", we assume that the allowed transition @xmath3 couples ( quasi)resonantly to the mode @xmath64 and the transition @xmath4 couples to the mode @xmath65 with coupling constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 that will be taken as real numbers .",
    "the bare basis for the total system is @xmath68 , is the usual two - mode fock basis .",
    "however , one can check that the two excitation - number operators @xmath69 are conserved quantities . in consequence ,",
    "we can rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ h3l ] ) as @xmath70 where @xmath71 the detunings are defined as @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "it is a straightforward calculation to check that @xmath74 = 0 .\\ ] ] therefore , both the free hamiltonian @xmath75 and the interaction hamiltonian @xmath76 are constants of motion .",
    "@xmath75 determines the total energy stored in the system , which is conserved by the interaction .",
    "this allows us to factor out @xmath77 from the evolution operator and drop it altogether .",
    "thus , the problem can be reduced to study the restriction of @xmath76 to each subspace @xmath78 with fixed values of the pair of excitation numbers @xmath79 . in each one of these subspaces @xmath78",
    "there are three basis vectors that can be written as @xmath80 where the values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are defined as @xmath83 note that when @xmath84 and @xmath85 or @xmath86 and @xmath87 some states may have negative photon occupation number and must be eliminated . in the subspace @xmath78 , @xmath76 is represented by the @xmath88 matrix @xmath89    let us assume that at @xmath90 the atomic wave function can be written as the coherent ( normalized ) superposition @xmath91 while the field is in a two - mode coherent state @xmath92 : @xmath93    at a later time @xmath94 the state vector for the atom - field system in the interaction picture can be expressed as @xmath95 are the matrix elements of the evolution operator in the subspace @xmath78 @xmath96    as can be seen , e.g. in ref  @xcite .",
    "this state describes completely the system evolution and will be the basis for our phase analysis in the following .",
    "as stated in the introduction , our goal is to describe the atom - field relative phase by resorting to a polar decomposition of the corresponding complex amplitudes . to this end , let us define the operators @xmath97 these operators satisfy most of the usual su(3 ) commutation relations provided ( [ nlc ] ) is recast as @xmath98= - \\hat{y}_+^{12 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath99 however , some of them must be modified in the following way @xmath100   & = & \\hat{n}_a ( 1 - 2 s^{11 } - s^{22 } ) , \\nonumber \\\\ \\ [ \\hat{x}_+^{23 } , \\hat{x}_-^{23 } ]   & = & \\hat{n}_b ( 1 - 2s^{22}-s^{11 } ) , \\\\ \\ [ \\hat{y}_+^{12 } , \\hat{y}_-^{12 } ]   & = & \\hat{n}_a \\hat{n}_b ( s^{11}-s^{22 } ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which corresponds to a polynomial deformation of the algebra su(3 ) . the essential point for us",
    "is that one can develop a theory in very close analogy with the standard su(3 ) algebra .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us focus first on the allowed transition @xmath3 and notice that in every three - dimensional invariant subspace @xmath78 the state @xmath101 plays the role of a _ vacuum state _ since @xmath102 in this subspace the operator @xmath103 is diagonal and we can work out again a polar decomposition similar to ( [ polar ] ) , namely @xmath104 where the operator @xmath105 is diagonal and @xmath106 = [ \\hat{e}^{13}_\\phi , \\hat{n}_b ] = 0 . & \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first equation ensures that the operator @xmath107 , representing the exponential of the relative phase between the field and the dipole @xmath3 , is unitary .",
    "the second one guarantees that we may study its restriction to each invariant subspace @xmath78 .",
    "much in the same way as we did in sec .",
    "ii , the operator @xmath108 solution of ( [ poldef ] ) can be expressed in @xmath78 as @xmath109 as one would expect , it acts as a ladder - like operator @xmath110 and thus has eigenvectors @xmath111 while the eigenvalues of @xmath112 are @xmath113 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "obviously , a similar reasoning for the transition @xmath4 gives the corresponding operator @xmath114 as @xmath115 with eigenvectors @xmath116 and the same eigenvalues as before .",
    "the states ( [ eig13 ] ) and ( [ eig23 ] ) are the basis for our subsequent analysis of the dynamics of the relative phase .      for any state",
    ", the information one can reap using a measurement of some observable is given by the statistical distribution of the measurement outcomes .",
    "once again , let us first focus on the relative phase between the field mode @xmath64 and the dipole transition @xmath3 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ ptheta ] ) it seems natural to define the probability distribution function of a state described by the density matrix @xmath117 as @xmath118   , \\ ] ] where the vectors @xmath119 are given in eq .",
    "( [ eig13 ] ) and the subscript @xmath120 runs the three possible eigenvalues 0 , and @xmath41 .",
    "this expression can be interpreted as a joint probability distribution for the relative phase and the excitation operators @xmath121 and @xmath122 . from this function",
    ", we can derive the distribution for the relative phase as the marginal distribution @xmath123 for a general state as in eq .",
    "( [ psit ] ) , one has @xmath124",
    "\\right |^2 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] much in the same way one also gets analogous results for the transition @xmath4 : @xmath125 \\right |^2 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is our basic and compact result to analyze the evolution of the relative phase .",
    "we have numerically evaluated this distribution for the three allowed values of the relative phase for the case when the atom is initially in the ground state @xmath126 and modes @xmath64 and @xmath65 are in a coherent state with a mean number of photons @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively . for computational simplicity",
    "we have used the rescaled time @xmath129 in all the plots and have assumed that @xmath130 , which is not a serious restriction .    in fig .",
    "2 we have plotted a typical situation of a weak field , in which the number of excitations in the system is small , say @xmath131 .",
    "the pattern shows an almost oscillatory behavior , which can be easily understood if we retain only the two first terms in the sums over @xmath132 and @xmath133 and use the explicit form of the evolution operator @xmath134 .",
    "a relevant and general feature that is apparent from this figure is that the probabilities associated with @xmath135 and @xmath136 always oscillate out of phase , a point previously demonstrated for the case of the jaynes - cummings model  @xcite .",
    "perhaps more interesting is the case of strong - field dynamics , when the number of excitations in the system is large and so @xmath127 or @xmath128 , or both , are large . in fig .",
    "3 we have plotted the relative - phase probabilities for @xmath137 and ( a ) @xmath138 , and ( b ) @xmath139 photons , with the atom initially in the ground state @xmath126 . when @xmath140 , the distribution @xmath141 ( which is the probability of finding the atom in the level @xmath43 ) is almost negligible , while @xmath142 show collapses and revivals .",
    "one may interpret this physically as follows : the transition @xmath3 is so intense due to stimulated processes in mode @xmath64 that there is no population transfer to level @xmath43 , which originates a regular oscillation of the dipole @xmath3 with the corresponding collapses and revivals in the relative phase .",
    "the well - known ( nearly ) time - independent behavior in the time windows between collapse and revival is also clear .",
    "the probability of finding the atom in the level @xmath126 , @xmath143 , tends to be 1/2 ( except at the revivals ) , which confirms that the transition @xmath3 is almost saturated .",
    "when @xmath128 grows , the position of the collapses and revivals changes , according to standard estimates  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath144 , @xmath141 is centered at 1/4 , while @xmath143 is centered at 1/2 , showing that the populations tend to be equidistributed because now the transition @xmath4 is almost saturated too .",
    "very interesting physical phenomena arise when one considers coherent superpositions of atomic states , because it is then possible to cancel absorption or emission under certain conditions , i.e. , the atom is effectively transparent to the incident field even in the presence of resonant transitions .",
    "a semiclassical analysis  @xcite , in which the fields are treated as @xmath145-numbers and described by the complex rabi frequencies @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( note that @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the ` phases ' of the respective fields ) , easily shows that when the initial atomic state is a superposition of the two lower levels of the form @xmath150 coherent trapping occurs whenever @xmath151 in other words , when these conditions are fulfilled the population is trapped in the lower states and there is no absorption .    to corroborate this behavior valid in the strong - field limit ,",
    "let us note that , although the transition @xmath5 is dynamically forbidden , one can still define phase eigenvectors for it : @xmath152 in fig .",
    "4 we have plotted the probabilities @xmath153 when the atom is initially in a trapped state like ( [ trap ] ) with @xmath144 .",
    "we see that @xmath154 , which is the probability of finding the atom in the upper state , shows the remarkable behavior of trapping , except for the presence of very small superimposed oscillations .",
    "note also that @xmath155 also shows the same kind of behavior .",
    "in this paper we have investigated an appropriate operator for the quantum description of the relative phase in the interaction of a three - level atom with quantum fields . to this end , we have resorted to a proper polar decomposition of the corresponding amplitudes , which has been justified on physical grounds as well as using the theory of polynomial deformations of su(3 ) .    from the phase states obtained in this procedure",
    "we have defined a probability distribution function for the relative phase and studied its time evolution , showing how the formalism could be applied to understanding more involved phenomena .",
