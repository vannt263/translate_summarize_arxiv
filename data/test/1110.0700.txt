    "in the gravitational collapse or pulsation of neutral stellar cores at densities comparable to the nuclear density , complex dynamical processes are expected to take place .",
    "these involve both macroscopic processes such as gravitational and hydrodynamical processes , as well as microscopic processes due to the strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "the time and length scales of macroscopic processes are much larger than those of the microscopic processes . despite the existence of only a few exact solutions of einstein s equations for simplified cases ,",
    "macroscopic processes can be studied rather well by numerical algorithms . in both analytical solutions and numerical simulations",
    "it is rather difficult to simultaneously analyze both macroscopic and microscopic processes characterized by such different time and length scales . in these approaches ,",
    "microscopic processes are approximately treated as local and instantaneous processes that are effectively represented by a model - dependent parametrized equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "we call this _ approximate locality_.    applying _ approximate locality _ to electric processes , as required by the charge conservation , one is led to _ local neutrality _ : positive and negative charge densities are exactly equal over all space and time . as a consequence ,",
    "all electric fields and processes are eliminated .",
    "an internal electric field ( charge separation ) _ must _ be developed @xcite in a totally neutral system of proton and electron fluids in a gravitational field .",
    "if the electric field ( process ) is weak ( slow ) enough , _ approximate locality _ is applicable .",
    "however , this should be seriously questioned when the electric field ( process ) is strong ( rapid ) . for example",
    ", neutral stellar cores reach the nuclear density where positive charged baryons interact via the strong interaction while electrons do not , in addition to their widely different masses . as a result ,",
    "their pressure , number , and energy density are described by different eos , and a strong electric field ( charge separation ) on the baryon core surface is realized @xcite in an electrostatic equilibrium state .",
    "furthermore , either gravitationally collapsing or pulsating of the baryon core leads to the dynamical evolution of electrons . as a consequence ,",
    "the strong electric field dynamically evolves in space and time , and some electromagnetic processes can result if their reaction rates are rapid enough , for example , the electron - positron pair - production process of sauter - heisenberg - euler - schwinger ( see the review @xcite ) for electric fields @xmath0 . if this indeed occurs , gravitational and pulsating energies of neutral stellar cores are converted into the observable energy of electron - positron pairs via the space and time evolution of electric fields . in this article",
    ", we present our studies of this possibility ( the natural units @xmath1 are adopted , unless otherwise specified ) .",
    "we attempt to study possible electric processes in the dynamical perturbations of neutral stellar cores .",
    "these dynamical perturbations can be caused by either the gravitational collapse or pulsation of neutral stellar cores .",

    "therefore , in the dynamical perturbations of neutral stellar cores , one should not expect that the space - time evolution of number density , energy density , four velocity , and pressure of baryon fluid be identical to the space - time evolution of counterparts of electron fluid .",
    "the difference of space - time evolutions of two fluids results in the electric current ( [ current ] ) and field @xmath4 , possibly leading to some electric processes . in a simplified model for the dynamical perturbations of neutral stellar cores , we approximately study possible electric processes by assuming that the equilibrium configurations of neutral stellar cores are initial configurations .",

    "however , in practice , it is a rather complicated problem that one has to deal with various interacting processes with very different time and length scales .",
    "the approach we adopt in this article is the adiabatic approximation : the interacting processes with very small rates are considered to be adiabatic processes in comparison with the interacting processes with very large rates @xcite .",
    "therefore , we try to split the problem of rapid microscopic processes from the problem of slow macroscopic processes , and focus on studying rapid microscopic processes in the background of adiabatic ( slowly varying ) macroscopic processes .",
    "the adiabatic approximation we adopted here is self - consistently and quantitatively justified by process rates @xmath170 studied in this article .",
    "in addition to the adiabatic approximation , we have not considered in this over simplified model the hydrodynamical evolution of baryon cores , the back - reaction of oscillations and pair - production on the collapsing or pulsating processes , and the dynamical evolution of the electron - positron pairs and photons . needless to say , these results should be further checked by numerical algorithms integrating the full einstein - maxwell equations and proper eos of particles in gravitational collapse .",
    "nevertheless , the possible consequences of these electromagnetic processes discussed in this article are definitely interesting and could be possibly relevant and important for understanding energetic sources of supernovae and gamma - ray bursts .",
