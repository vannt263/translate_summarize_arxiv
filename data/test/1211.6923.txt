    "galaxy mergers and interactions play a key role in cosmological evolution , affecting galaxy morphology , the star - formation history by triggering intense bursts of star formation @xcite , and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) via the growth of central supermassive black holes @xcite . besides spectacular episodes of star formation , .",
    "interacting galaxies , in relatively isolated pairs or galaxy groups containing at least one gas rich member , are ideally suited where such interactions take place in a group , the stripped gas evolves under the influence of the intra - group medium ( igm ) while at the same time contributing to it .",
    "studying the stripped gas can reveal information about gas dynamics , star formation , igm enrichment and the formation of tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) .",
    "star formation beyond the galaxy disks and the principles governing it have attracted a lot of recent attention @xcite and the advent of ultraviolet ( uv ) and mid - infrared ( mir ) telescopes like galex and spitzer have enabled major advances in such studies .",
    "star formation from tidally stripped gas .",
    "atomic and molecular gas observations of such systems provide the conditions under which star formation is triggered in these regions .",
    "these entities known as tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) @xcite .        due to active ongoing star formation",
    "they normally have characteristic blue colours and high velocity dispersions .",
    "typical hi masses of tdgs few times 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 and stellar masses are few times 10@xmath4 m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "besides contributing to the dwarf galaxy population , tdgs provide us with further insights towards understanding galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "in addition to tidally stripped gas and galactic winds @xcite , in situ star formation in tidal debris can be an important source of igm enrichment .",
    "@xcite estimate that star - formation rate ( sfr ) as low as 1.5@xmath510@xmath6 m@xmath3 yr@xmath7 maintained for 1 gyr , can raise the igm metallicity by @xmath01@xmath510@xmath6 solar .",
    "this value compares well with the  metallicity floor \" @xmath01.4@xmath510@xmath6 solar in the damped lyman alpha ( dla ) gas , observed over a redshift range of 0.5 to 5 @xcite .    in this letter we present one of the most spectacular cases of the impact on hi of a tidal interaction between a pair of spirals , ngc 3212 and ngc 3215 , which make up the arp 181 system and possibly a third small galaxy .",
    "ngc 3212 has been classified as an ` s ? ' galaxy at a redshift of 0.0324 , while ngc 3215 has been classified as an ` sb ? ' galaxy at a redshift of 0.0316 @xcite .",

    "the baseband bandwidth used was 8 mhz for the hi 21-cm line observations giving a velocity resolution of @xmath013 km  s@xmath7 . to signal to noise ratio",
    "the velocity resolution was smoothed to @xmath026 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "the gmrt data were reduced using astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software package .",
    "bad malfunctioning antennas , antennas with abnormally low gain and/or radio frequency interference ( rfi ) were flagged .",
    "the flux densities are on the scale of @xcite , with flux density uncertainties of  cubes were produced following continuum subtraction in the uv domain using the aips tasks ` uvsub ' and ` uvlin ' .",
    "the task ` imagr ' was used to obtain the final cleaned  image cubes . from these cubes",
    "the integrated  and   velocity field maps were extracted using the aips task ` momnt ' ( using a 3@xmath9 cut - off ) . to analyse the   structures , we produced image cubes of different resolutions by tapering the data with different uv limits and using uniform weights for the high resolution maps .",

    "figure [ fig1 ] ( upper panel ) , shows that almost the entire hi mass of the system is detected well beyond the optical disks of ngc3212 and ngc3215 and is connected to ngc3212 by a low density hi bridge .",

    "the velocity field of the western hi mass shows no signs of regular rotation at this velocity resolution .",

    "within the limits of current spectroscopic data arp 181 appears to be a fairly isolated system .",
    "the nearest similar size neighbour is cgcg 350 - 053 projected at an angular distance of @xmath030.4@xmath18 ( 1.4 mpc ) with a velocity separation of @xmath0 2000 .",
    "there are several small galaxies projected close to arp 181 , but they lack spectroscopic data to confirm their distances .",
    "thus it is possible arp 181 is a galaxy group dominated by ngc3212 and ngc3215 .",
    "the system has been previously observed with spitzer @xcite , galex @xcite and in h@xmath1 ( @xmath16 ) .    based on their galex and optical observations ,",
    "@xcite conclude this system potentially hosts one or more tdgs .",

    "this galaxy appears to have spiral features in the sdss images , and extremely blue in nuv ",

    "the    our observations reveal    tidal interaction between ngc 3212 , ngc 3215 and sdss j102726.32 + 794911.9 seems to be a likely as there is no nearby neighbour of similar size in similar redshift range within @xmath0 3mpc radius .",
    "also both the arp 181 severely hi deficient indicating from the galaxies . to determine gas loss from a spiral is to compare its hi surface density deficiency is log@xmath19 @xcite , where where @xmath20 is the total hi mass of a galaxy and @xmath21 is the optical major isophotal diameter ( in kpc ) measured at or reduced to a surface brightness level m@xmath22 = 25.0 mag / arcsec@xmath23 .",
    "while @xcite used the ugc major diameters , we have used the rc3 diameters and used the modified values from @xcite .",
    "the expected value of this parameter for an early type spiral ( sb ) is 6.91 @xmath17 0.26 . since morphological",
    "sub - classifications are not available for ngc 3212 and ngc 3215 , we compared these galaxies against sb type spirals .",
    "the hi surface density values for ngc 3212 and ngc 3215 are hi deficient by a factor of 10 .",
    "the tidal bridge connecting ngc3212 to the also supports that this hi mass is a tidal debris from the arp 181 interaction .",
    "the small dwarf system , sdss j102726.32 + 794911.9 , may also be participating in the interaction . the high - resolution hi image ( lower right of figure [ fig1 ] )",
    "shows the hp(s ) to be offset by @xmath0 5@xmath15 ( a beam ) from the optical centre of sdss j102726.32 + 794911.9 and its hi extends in the direction of the candidate tdg .",
    "however , given its size , the hi mass contributed by this system    another scenario .",
    "under this scenario hp(s ) is lsb .",
    "the sdss images show distinct spiral pattern in sdss j102726.32 + 794911.9 and thus it is possible that only the central bright part of this galaxy is visible . however , two significant this scenario .",
    "the hi column density peak value for the high - resolution map reaches a higher value than the low - resolution map , indicating the to be compact and clumpy .",
    "the peak values and dimensions of the hi clumps in the high - resolution hi map are similar for hp(n ) and hp(s ) , consistent with both being . also contrary to what is expected of a big lsb spiral , we find no signs of regular rotation in this mass . instead the velocity field of the western  mass is chaotic and ( lower panel figure [ fig1 ] ) shows an interesting gradient suggesting infall of gas from the eastern and the western sides towards the central region . thus we find this more like tidal debris than an interacting massive lsb disk .    as explained in section 3 , the debris has two peaks , hp(n ) and hp(s ) , and we confirm these peaks coincide , with small offsets ( @xmath0 5@xmath24 , with the two dwarf galaxies described in @xcite , the tdg and sdss j102726.32 + 794911.9 respectively . from the channel images and the gmrt spectrum , we find this is the tdg candidate suggested by @xcite .",
    "the in the low - resolution ( @xmath0 30@xmath15 ) map for this object is 6.6@xmath510@xmath25@xmath26 . at a distance of 130 mpc ,",
    "a 30@xmath15 beam samples @xmath018 kpc .",
    "the   mass of the debris and the hi column density values are a good match with those found in tdgs @xcite .",
    "the high - resolution ( @xmath0 10@xmath15 ) hi map further confirms the hi peak to be associated with the tdg as well as hi extension to the east towards the tidal tail of ngc3212 .",
    "hp(s ) on the other hand , coincides with the small , very blue galaxy either a dwarf galaxy or a recently detached tdg .",
    "our high - resolution hi image ( lower right of figure [ fig1 ] ) shows an offset ( @xmath0 5@xmath15 ) between the galaxy and the hi peak . from the gmrt spectrum",
    ", we find the hi either interacting with the tidal debris the latter option is unlikely as the galaxy is bright in sdss z  band suggesting presence of an old stellar population a recently formed tdg . unlike the diffuse structure associated with hp(n ) ,",
    "bright in the spitzer images implying strong star formation activity , possibly triggered by interaction .",
    "massive displacement of hi from the galaxy disk due to tidal interaction has been witnessed in a few other cases also @xcite . of these",
    ", the hi distribution of the arp 181 system very closely resembles arp 105 @xcite . in the arp 105 system , bulk of the",
    "arp 181 is a system at moderate redshift @xmath0 0.032 .",
