    "there has been considerable interest recently in understanding the statistical properties of polymerized ( or tethered ) membranes @xcite .",
    "this interest in large part is due to the membrane behavior which is much richer than that of polymers , their one - dimensional analog .",
    "in addition , this interest is justified by a variety of real systems like red - blood - cell cytoskeletons @xcite , graphite oxide sheets @xcite or dispersed silicate ( clay ) platelets @xcite which can be modeled by networks of fixed connectivity , generally referred to as polymerized membranes .",
    "along with the experimental studies , self - avoiding polymerized membranes have also attracted remarkable interest from the point of view of basic research in recent years .",
    "their static properties have been studied analytically and numerically @xcite .",
    "much of these studies have been spent in the pursuit of the so called `` crumpling transition '' between a low - temperature flat phase and a high - temperature crumpled phase until it was realized @xcite that self - avoiding membranes are always flat ( with an _ infinite _ persistence length ) , i.e. , their radius of gyration @xmath13 scales with linear size @xmath14 as @xmath15 where the flory exponent @xmath16 .",
    "the flat phase arises even without explicit bending rigidity because the resistance to in - plane shear deformations leads to anomalous stiffening of the surface in the presence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "in contrast to static properties , the membrane dynamics is less well - understood .",
    "earlier analytical and numeric studies @xcite have revealed that the self - avoiding restrictions considerably modify the relaxation times of the tethered surface .",
    "thus the typical relaxation time @xmath0 of a tethered membrane in the case of rouse dynamics when hydrodynamic interactions are neglected has been predicted by simple scaling arguments @xcite to vary as @xmath17 .",
    "if , as in polymer physics , one introduces a _ dynamic exponent _",
    "@xmath18 , describing the relaxation process as @xmath19 , then one gets @xmath20 ( for linear polymers one has @xmath21 ) . usually , @xmath0 is considered to be the time needed for the membrane to diffuse its radius of gyration . for tethered membranes ,",
    "highly permeable to the solvent as in isolated spectrin networks , one is in the rouse regime @xcite and the diffusion coefficient @xmath3 scales with membrane size @xmath14 as @xmath22 .",
    "thus the time it takes for such a flat membrane to move a distance @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "in contrast , for impermeable membranes ( like , e.g. , erythrocytes ) where solvent backflow ( i.e. , a long - ranged hydrodynamic interaction ) is important , one has in @xmath24-dimensions in the case of zimm dynamics @xmath25 ( i.e. @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 .",
    "thus one may view permeability as constituting two different dynamic universality classes of tethered membranes @xcite whereby these classes ( rouse dynamics - highly permeable membranes , or zimm dynamics - impermeable membranes ) are observed for a wave vector independent ( or , dependent ) friction coefficient .",
    "recently , a series of simulation studies by pandey et al .",
    "@xcite has revealed a multiscale stochastic dynamics of tethered membranes at times before normal diffusive behavior is reached .",
    "the displacement motion of the central node , @xmath28 , of a four - coordinated coarse - grained model membrane has been observed to undergo a subdiffusive mean - square displacement ( msqd ) @xmath7 with the exponent @xmath8 attaining different values in the short and intermediate time regimes before turning to normal diffusion for @xmath29 with @xmath30 .    in the present work",
    "we employ an efficient off - lattice monte carlo algorithm , focusing on the subdiffusive dynamics of self - avoiding tethered membranes and comparing some of the salient dynamic features to those of linear polymers .",
    "our observations , based on extensive computer simulations , largely confirm those of previous investigators @xcite . as a step forward , however , we suggest a scaling theory which explains our findings for the anomalous membrane dynamics , relating the observed values of @xmath8 to the specific stochastic motion of particular groups of sheet segments .    after briefly introducing our model in section ii ,",
    "this is considered in section iii where we focus on the main results of our investigation and their interpretation .",
    "we close this paper with a brief summary and discussion in section iv .",
    "we study a coarse - grained model of _ self - avoiding tethered membranes _ , embedded in three - dimensional space .",
    "the membranes have a hexagonal lattice structure where each monomer interacts with six nearest - neighbors - fig .  [ snap ] .",
    "there are altogether @xmath31 monomers in     with linear size ( the edge length of a regular hexagonal sheet ) @xmath32 which contains @xmath33 monomers .",
    "periphery segments at the rim of the membrane are shaded grey ( green ) while the six monomers at the vertices ( corners ) of the sheet are dark grey ( red ) . ]",
    "such a membrane where by @xmath14 we denote the number of monomers on the edge of the network ( i.e. @xmath14 is the linear size of the membrane ) . in this model ,",
    "spherical particles of diameter @xmath34 are connected in a fixed geometry by flexible strings of length @xmath35 . to prevent self - intersection of the membrane ,",
    "the maximum length of the strings between the centers of the spheres must be @xmath36 , then the membrane is self - avoiding in that it can not intersect itself .",
    "the bonded nearest neighbor monomers on the membrane interact with each other through the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential @xcite where a bond @xmath35 has a maximum length @xmath37 and a minimum length @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "\\label{eq_u_fene}\\ ] ] the minimum of this potential occurs for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , near @xmath42 it is harmonic , with @xmath43 being a spring constant , and the potential diverges to infinity both when @xmath44 and when @xmath45 .",
    "choosing our length unit @xmath46 , we choose the other parameters as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes the absolute temperature , and @xmath49 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "self - avoidance is observed by the interaction between particles which are not nearest neighbors on the network .",
    "the nonbonded interaction between monomers is described by a morse potential where @xmath50 is the distance between the monomers , @xmath51 - 2\\exp [ -\\alpha(r - r_{\\text{min } } ) ] \\label{eq_u_morse}\\ ] ] with parameters @xmath52 .",
    "the minimum of this potential occurs for @xmath53 . for @xmath54",
    "essentially is zero for @xmath55 .",
    "choosing then units of length such that @xmath56 , we hence can take @xmath57 .",
    "the repulsive part of this potential guarantees self - avoidance of the membrane .",
    "we have used the standard monte carlo procedure to investigate the thermodynamic properties of self - avoiding tethered membranes .",
    "the total energy ( hamiltonian ) is the sum of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_u_fene ] ) and ( [ eq_u_morse ] ) . in each monte carlo update ,",
    "a monomer is chosen at random and one attempts to displace it randomly by displacements chosen uniformly from the intervals @xmath58 .",
    "the attempted move is accepted or rejected according to the conventional metropolis criterion by comparing the transition probability @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 is the energy difference between the configurations after and before the trial move ) with a random number uniformly distributed between zero and unity .",
    "if @xmath61 exceeds this random number , the attempted move is accepted , otherwise it is rejected .",
    "time is measured in monte carlo steps ( mcs ) per monomer whereby a single mcs is elapsed after @xmath5 monomers are picked at random and given the chance to perform a trial move .",
    "since our potentials are constructed such that the membrane can not intersect itself in the course of random displacements of monomers , one does not need to check separately for entanglement restrictions during the simulation .",
    "thus the algorithm is reasonably fast .",
    "nevertheless , the simulation takes quite a long time for large self - avoiding membranes to equilibrate and then move a substantial distance in space .",
    "this and the necessity to attain very good statistical accuracy have limited our investigations to sizes @xmath62 . eventually , we would like to note that the interactions used in the present off - lattice model , albeit somewhat more refined and complicated than the simple potential used in earlier simulations on a cubic lattice  @xcite , do not change the physics of the problem and lead qualitatively to the same results .",
    "before we focus on the subdiffusive dynamics of our membranes , we show in fig .",
    "[ gyration ] the scaling behavior of the gyration radius , @xmath63    , and the three eigenvalues , @xmath64 against the linear size @xmath14 of flat tethered membranes ( @xmath65 ) at @xmath66 .",

    "we also sample the eigenvalues @xmath72 of the inertial tensor , @xmath73 where @xmath74 , the sum is taken over all particles of a given configuration , and @xmath75 is the @xmath8 component of the center of mass radius vector for a given configuration .",
    "the three eigenvalues are ordered according to magnitude @xmath76 .",
    "the directions of the principal axes are given by the three eigenvectors corresponding to the three eigenvalues .",
    "for a planar membrane , the eigenvector associated with @xmath77 is perpendicular to the plane of the membrane while the eigenvectors associated with @xmath78 and @xmath79 lie in the plane of the membrane .",

    "[ gyration ] that our membranes are indeed flat with scaling exponents @xmath80 for @xmath13 , @xmath81 for @xmath78 , and @xmath82 for @xmath79 .",
    "the asphericity ratio @xmath83 tends to zero with an exponent @xmath84 , indicating that these membranes are indeed asymptotically flat .",

    "[ gyration ] and in the following figures the error bars do not exceed the size of the symbols .",
    "turning now to membrane dynamics in the rouse regime , one may assume that each segment of the membrane moves under the influence of surface forces ( surface stretching due to near - neighbors and excluded volume forces due to distant neighbors ) , and a random force representing thermal noise .",
    "as far as the contribution of inertial terms to membrane motion can be neglected for sufficiently long times , one may assume that the relevant dynamics is purely diffusive .",
    "with @xmath87 being the rate of position changes of monomers per unit time and @xmath88 , the dynamic exponent , one may write the relaxation time of the membrane @xmath0 as @xmath89 if monomeric orientations add up randomly and one neglects correlations , the msqd of the membrane center of mass is @xmath90 ^ 2\\rangle = \\rho \\langle \\left(\\frac{l}{n}\\right)^2 \\rangle nt = \\rho \\frac{\\langle \\text{\\em l}^2\\rangle}{n}t , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because each monomeric motion moves the center of mass by a random displacement of the order _ l_@xmath91 , _",

    "( [ beta ] ) .",
    "we believe that a possible explanation of this sluggishness of flat membranes at early times @xmath152 may be found if one assumes that in this interval only the most loosely bound monomers ( those at the membrane periphery , or rather , those at the six vertices of the hexagonal sheet ) actually contribute to a displacement of the membrane center of mass while all monomers with six - fold coordination in the bulk of the membrane are virtually blocked by their neighbors and for this short time hardly move . as far as the membrane retains its flat shape and does not fold , the maximal displacement of these loosely bound monomers can not exceed the effective thickness @xmath153 . indeed , a comparison of fig .",

    "one can , therefore , estimate the characteristic time @xmath154 if , in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ g3 ] ) , one considers @xmath158 in case that _ only _ the membrane periphery of length @xmath159 contributes to the center of mass displacement . thus during @xmath160 the diffusion coefficient of the membrane becomes @xmath161 reflecting the slow displacement of the center of mass .",

    "@xmath163 one obtains then the broken exponent for a _ periphery - driven _",
    "membrane @xmath164 .",
    "in contrast , if only a finite number of loosely bound monomers at the vertices effect the net displacement of the center of mass , one obtains then @xmath165 and therefore temporarily @xmath166 so that @xmath167 . in this case",
    "one gets the exponent for anomalous diffusion of a _ vertices - driven _ membrane @xmath168 .",
    "thus we obtain two estimates which may be considered as the lower and upper bounds of the anomalous diffusion exponent , @xmath169 , depending on the particular mechanism involved in the diffusive motion .",
    "the measured value of @xmath10 lies indeed within these limits .",
    "of course , one should bear in mind that most probably neither mechanism of diffusion ( vertices - driven , or periphery - driven ) takes place alone and the real process involves a mixture of both .",
    "moreover , at this point we can not rule out the possibility that at times @xmath170 _ all _ membrane segments eventually get the chance to perform an elementary move and thus contribute to the center of mass motion . such a possibility would imply that during this time interval of subdiffusive motion one observes a msqd @xmath171 with an exponent @xmath151 , cf .",
    "( [ beta ] ) .",
    "we have indicated such a behavior in fig .",
    "[ g1 ] by a dashed line with slope @xmath172 and it appears compatible with the course of @xmath105 in between @xmath154 and @xmath0 for our largest membranes @xmath173 . if such a diffusive regime really exists , it would underline the multiscaling character of tethered membranes @xcite .",
    "it is clear , however , that larger micelles need to be simulated with satisfactory statistics before an unambiguous conclusion in this respect can be drawn .",
    "in the present work we have studied the stochastic dynamics of flat self - avoiding tethered membranes which are assumed to be completely permeable to the surrounding good solvent and are thus expected to display typical rouse behavior . by means of extensive monte carlo simulations",
    "we find that the static properties of our tethered membranes are described by scaling exponents which agree very well with the appropriate theoretically predicted values .",
    "thus the radius of gyration scales with membrane linear size @xmath14 as @xmath174 with @xmath81 , and the membrane thickness , @xmath175 with roughness exponent @xmath176 while the membrane asphericity vanishes asymptotically as @xmath177 with @xmath178 .",
    "in the regime of rouse diffusion we find with good accuracy that the diffusion coefficient @xmath4 , as predicted , whereas the typical relaxation time of such polymerized membranes grows as @xmath179 with the linear dimension @xmath14 .",
    "a comparative study , involving linear polymers too , reveals also that the diffusion coefficient of permeable self - avoiding tethered membranes , containing @xmath5 segments , is three times smaller than that of linear polymer chains with the same number of segments .    our main concern in this study ,",
    "however , is with the subdiffusive motion of the membranes central segment at times @xmath180 .",
    "our numeric studies reveal several regimes of anomalous diffusion whereby the central node msqd grows as @xmath181 for @xmath182 , then @xmath183 for @xmath184 , further , with @xmath185 at time @xmath186 , before turning eventually to normal diffusion with @xmath187 for @xmath29 .",
    "we use simple scaling arguments to interpret our observation and suggest that the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath188 which we find in agreement with recent studies @xcite most probably reflects several particular mechanisms of membrane motion .",
    "these mechanisms involve different groups of loosely bound membrane monomers whose random hops predominantly contribute to the center of mass motion of the whole membrane at times when most of the inner monomers are mutually blocked by their nearest neighbors and , therefore , remain rather immobile .",
    "the particular geometry of the membrane sheet ( e.g. , square , hexagonal , or rhombic ) is expected to enhance the role of either periphery , or vertex monomers , and therefore slightly modify the observed value of the anomalous exponent @xmath8 according to eqs .",
    "( [ periphery ] ) and ( [ vertices ] ) .",
    "this would explain some small deviations of our data from that of earlier measurements  @xcite .",
    "we believe that our results shed some light and provide insight into the complex dynamics of polymerized membranes .",
    "it is , however , clear that further work is needed before the nature of the membrane stochastic dynamics is definitely established and understood .",

    "<S> using a continuum bead - spring monte carlo model , we study the anomalous diffusion dynamics of a self - avoiding tethered membrane by means of extensive computer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the subdiffusive stochastic motion of the membrane s central node in the regime of flat membranes at temperatures above the membrane folding transition . while at times , larger than the characteristic membrane relaxation time @xmath0 , the mean - square displacement of the center of mass of the sheet , @xmath1 , as well as that of its central node , @xmath2 , show the normal rouse diffusive behavior with a diffusion coefficient @xmath3 scaling as @xmath4 with respect to the number of segments @xmath5 in the membrane , for short times @xmath6 we observe a _ multiscale dynamics _ of the central node , @xmath7 , where the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath8 changes from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , and then to @xmath11 , before diffusion turns eventually to normal . by means of simple scaling arguments </S>",
    "<S> we show that our main result , @xmath12 , can be related to particular mechanisms of membrane dynamics which involve different groups of segments in the membrane sheet . </S>",
    "<S> a comparative study involving also linear polymers demonstrates that the diffusion coefficient of self - avoiding tethered membranes , containing @xmath5 segments , is three times smaller than that of linear polymer chains with the same number of segments . </S>"
