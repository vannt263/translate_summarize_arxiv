    "neutral pion photoproduction on the proton at low energies is specially sensitive to chiral dynamics . considering the range of energies from threshold to 500 mev",
    ", the total cross section appears to be clearly dominated by the magnetic dipole excitation of the @xmath1 .",
    "its role is more important here than for the charged pions photoproduction , because of the smallness of the electric dipole contribution for the neutral pion channels .",
    "of course , approaching low energies , the relevance of the @xmath0 resonance decreases fast and may become negligible as we get far from its mass and because of the @xmath2-wave nature of its contribution .",
    "close to threshold , charged pion photoproduction has a relatively large cross section that can be well described by just tree - level diagrams which lead to a substantial electric dipole moment .",
    "however , the situation is quite different for the neutral pion channels which present a much smaller cross section .",
    "qualitatively , this is also well understood as the theoretical models produce a tiny @xmath3-wave amplitude , which actually vanishes in the chiral limit @xmath4 .",
    "the smallness of the lowest order tree - level contributions offers a good opportunity for the study of higher order terms of the chiral lagrangian and of loop effects .",
    "in fact , one of the important successes of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) was the discovery in refs .",
    "@xcite of the importance of the loop contributions for the @xmath5 channels .",
    "this allowed to solve the serious discrepancies between data @xcite and the low energy theorems ( let ) obtained by previous theoretical models @xcite based on current algebra and the partial conservation of the axial current @xcite .",
    "the model of refs .",
    "@xcite was further improved in refs .",
    "@xcite using a more systematic approach , heavy - baryon chpt ( hbchpt ) , which allows for a proper power counting scheme .",
    "the neutral pion photoproduction off protons was analyzed to fourth order in hbchpt in @xcite finding a good agreement with the data that were available at the time .",
    "however , the new and very precise data for the @xmath6 reaction obtained at the mainz microtron ( mami ) @xcite have clearly shown the limits of this approach . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that fourth order hbchpt agrees well with data only up to around 20 mev above threshold .",
    "an alternative relativistic renormalization scheme of the baryons chpt , the extended on mass shell ( eoms ) chpt @xcite has been successfully applied to the study of several physical observables such as pion scattering , baryon magnetic moments and axial form factors , baryon masses among others @xcite .",
    "the eoms approach is covariant , satisfies analyticity constraints lost in the hb formulation and usually converges relatively faster .",
    "surprisingly , a fourth order eoms calculation of the @xmath6 process described the experimental data even slightly worse than the hb one  @xcite .    a possible reason for the poor agreement could be due to the importance of the @xmath0 resonance , not included in the aforementioned calculations as an explicit degree of freedom .",
    "here , it could be more visible than for other channels due to the smallness of the nucleonic contributions of the lowest orders .",
    "this was already pointed out by hemmert et al . in ref .",
    "actually , they obtained a moderate effect for the electric dipole amplitude at threshold in their hb approach .",
    "this result was further explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , also in a hbchpt static calculation , finding a sizable cancellation of the @xmath0 contributions by fourth order loop effects .",
    "however , it could be expected that , in a dynamical calculation ( with the full @xmath0 propagator ) , the effects could grow very fast as a function of the photon energy as the invariant mass of the system at threshold is close to the resonance mass ( @xmath7 ) . of course , the @xmath0 effects could be accounted for by a change in the low energy constants ( lecs ) and by higher order terms .",
    "however , if the @xmath0 resonance plays an important role , its inclusion could lead to a faster convergence and more natural values of the lecs .",
    "the possible relevance of the @xmath0 mechanisms for this process was also signaled in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our purpose in this work is to explore the influence of the @xmath0 mediated mechanisms in the photoproduction of @xmath5 off protons .",
    "we will calculate the process in the purely nucleonic eoms chpt scheme up to order @xmath8 and will add the @xmath0 resonance contribution at tree level .",
    "we will compare our results with the precise data on the near threshold angular cross sections and photon asymmetries from ref .",

    "[ fig:2 ] , which contain exclusively mesonic loops , do not break the power counting .",

    "@xcite and , e.g. , some works on pion electro- and photoproduction @xcite , or compton scattering evaluated in covariant chpt @xcite .",
    "there are also some recent advances incorporating the @xmath0 as a dynamic degree of freedom in the analysis of @xmath48 scattering @xcite in the same eoms approach that we use here .    for the neutral pion photoproduction close to threshold ,",

    "[ fig:6 ] and the crossed one , in a dynamic fashion maintaining the energy dependence of the resonance propagator . to describe the @xmath0 interactions we use consistent lagrangians which ensure the decoupling of the spurious spin-1/2 components of the rarita - schwinger field .",

    "hence , one obtains the rule @xmath72 where now @xmath73 is the number of @xmath0 propagators .",
    "thus , we have taken into account all the amplitudes up to order @xmath74 according to this counting rule , as well as the @xmath0 tree - level contribution proportional to @xmath55 of order @xmath75 .",
    "the effect of this latter piece is negligible .",

    "the analysis of these data has shown that hbchpt agrees well only up to approximately 20 mev above threshold @xcite and covariant chpt does it even worse @xcite .",
    "this result was nicely shown by studying the @xmath80 per degree of freedom as a function of the maximum photon energy of the data included in the fit .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , we show our results for this magnitude .",
    "we have fixed @xmath12 and @xmath81 to their physical values for proton and neutral pion , @xmath82 mev and the @xmath0 couplings as given in the previous section .",
    "we prefer to fix @xmath54 and @xmath55 , even when the latter one is poorly known . in principle , these values could also be fitted , but a more comprehensive analysis including other charge channels and a wider range of energies , where the @xmath0 mechanisms could be dominant , would be better suited for that purpose . as we will see below , at low energies and for our channel , the size of the @xmath0 contribution is relatively small , even when it is essential to get a good agreement with data .",
    "the rest of the lecs , @xmath43 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 have been taken as free parameters .",
    "we start our fit at energies above the charged pion threshold to avoid the cusp effects .",
    "the loop contributions improve the agreement at the threshold region , showing the remarkable effect already found in ref .",
    "@xcite . still , the @xmath80 of our model with tree - level and loop diagrams up to @xmath9 and just nucleons grows quickly as a function of the photon energy and qualitatively reproduces the previous results of refs .",
    "this is only to be expected , as @xcite , which corresponds to a higher order calculation in the same eoms covariant chpt approach used here , with further free parameters , could not reach a good agreement over the whole energy range .",
    "the situation changes drastically as soon as the @xmath0 mechanisms are included , even when it does not imply any new free parameter . as an additional check",
    ", we also let free @xmath54 , the dominant magnetic @xmath86 coupling , and we obtain for the best fit @xmath87 , which is very close to the value taken from the literature .",
    "although this could suggest that there is enough information on the current data to fix @xmath0 lecs , a more general study would be convenient , because higher order terms might modify this result .     per degree of freedom as a function of the maximum photon energy of the data included in the fit .",
    "solid circles : full model , triangles : model without the @xmath0 resonance , empty circles : only tree - level nucleonic contributions ( without @xmath0 and loops ) .",
    "lines to guide the eye . ]",
    "the values of the lecs for the different cases studied can be seen in tab .",
    "[ tab:1 ] .",
    "in particular , we could fix @xmath43 to its physical value without altering the quality of the fit , as the effects of the modification are absorbed by changes in the other lecs .        as is obvious from the low @xmath80 value , the overall agreement of the full model is good . in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] , we show two extreme ( low and high energy ) plots of the data set compared with our model with and without @xmath0 mechanisms to better observe their effects . without @xmath0 , the model has a too slow energy dependence , which can not reproduce the rapid increase of the cross section .",
    "thus , the best fit occurs when the model overestimates the low energy data and underestimates the higher energy ones . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0 mechanisms lead to a sharper slope allowing for a good fit over the whole energy range .",
    "we also show in the figure the cross sections obtained taking only the @xmath0 contribution , which is relatively small at all energies .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the neutral pion photoproduction on the proton near threshold in covariant chiral perturbation theory with the explicit inclusion of @xmath0 degrees of freedom at @xmath9 and using the eoms renormalization approach .",
    "we have compared our model with the recent and precise data from ref .",
    "@xcite finding a good agreement for both the cross section and the linearly polarized photon asymmetry .",
