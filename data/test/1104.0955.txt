    "we consider the case where the motion perpendicular to the average magnetic field is dominated by guiding center motion which includes the meandering of the mfl and the drift from the first - order orbit theory , in the approximation that the particle gyroradius is much smaller than the length scale of magnetic field variations .",

    "secondly , we provide analytical time - dependence of drift and mfl coefficients of diffusion for a 3d isotropic turbulence .",
    "we found that for a 3d isotropic turbulence the particle drift from the local field line is diffusive , whereas the field line itself is superdiffusive .",

    ", we find that mflrw is dominated by length - scales larger than the coherence length whereas particle drift from the local field line is dominated by length - scales smaller than the coherence length .",
    "this disentaglement does not hold for 3d isotropic turbulence : mflrw is still dominated by large length - scales whereas as far as drift is concerned turbulent energy contribute at all scales , both below and above the coherence length .",
