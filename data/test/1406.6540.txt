    "interest in the gravitational @xmath1-matrix at transplanckian energies  @xcite has revived in the past few - years  @xcite , when explicit solutions of the so - called reduced - action model  @xcite have been found  @xcite .",
    "the model is a much simplified version of the acv eikonal approach  @xcite to transplanckian scattering in string - gravity , and is valid in the regime in which the gravitational radius @xmath2 is much larger than the string length @xmath3 , so that string - effects are supposed to be small .    the reduced - action model  ( sec .",
    "[ s : rcram ] ) was derived by justifying the eikonal form of the @xmath1-matrix at impact parameter @xmath4 on the basis of string dynamics and by then calculating the eikonal itself ( of order @xmath5 ) in the form of a 2-dimensional action , whose power series in @xmath0 corresponds to an infinite sum of proper irreducible diagrams ( the `` multi - h '' diagrams  @xcite ) , evaluated in the high - energy limit .",
    "the model admits a quantum generalization  @xcite of the @xmath1-matrix in the form of a path - integral  with definite boundary conditions  of the reduced - action exponential itself .",
    "the main feature of the model and of its boundary conditions is the existence of a critical impact parameter @xmath6 such that , for @xmath7 the @xmath1-matrix matches the perturbative series and is unitary , while for @xmath8 the field solutions are complex - valued and the elastic @xmath1-matrix is suppressed exponentially .",
    "the suppression exponent is of order @xmath9 ( @xmath10 being the planck length ) or , if we wish , of the same order as the entropy of a black - hole of radius @xmath11 . from various arguments we believe that in the region in which @xmath8 ( that is , @xmath4 is smaller than the gravitational radius ) , a classical gravitational collapse is taking place .",
    "a key issue related to the collapse region is the possible existence of information loss at quantum level , which in the acv model shows up as lack of @xmath1-matrix unitarity . according to  @xcite such unitarity loss",
    "is mostly related to a restrictive boundary condition , which is required for the solutions of the model be uv - safe . if such condition is relaxed , further solutions show up , which could contribute to unitarity , but are irregular  i.e. ,  dominated by planckian distances , region in which the model itself is inadequate .",
    "the main motivation of the present paper is to improve and complete some unsatisfactory aspects of the reduced - action model which might be crucial at planckian distances , but show up already at distances of order @xmath12 , the gravitational radius . the new model that we shall present here features two improvements .",
    "firstly , the eikonal representation itself is embedded in three dimensions , so as to be able to describe the motion of the breit - frame during the scattering process . by comparison ,",
    "the usual two - dimensional representation is inadequate outside the regime of very small angle scattering , and in particular in the collapse region .",
    "in fact , the energy - momentum of the impinging particles is taken to be an external light - like source  without any deflection  which generates gravitational fields characterized by aichelburg - sexl - like shock waves  @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting action predicts the einstein deflection angle  @xcite and corrections to it  @xcite , at variance with the original assumption of frozen sources .",
    "instead , we know from the beginning  @xcite that in the classical limit the gravitational equations should predict both particle motion and fields in a self - consistent way . for that to be possible , the improved eikonal representation is needed .",
    "the additional important improvement of the present model is the treatment of rescattering corrections of the produced gravitons .",
    "such effects were argued in  @xcite to be of particular interest for the irregular solutions of the model , perhaps explaining their relationship to collapse and their contribution to unitarity .",
    "but , independently of such a feature , we shall argue here that even for regular ( uv - safe ) solutions , rescattering corrections are needed in order to achieve self - consistency of motion and metric at higher orders in the eikonal expansion .    to start with , we deal with the self - consistency problem at leading level , in which the eikonal refers to frozen undeflected sources ,",
    "the metric contains two aichelburg - sexl ( as ) shock waves , while the action predicts the einstein deflection angle @xmath13 , as function of the impact parameter @xmath4 and of the gravitational radius @xmath14 ( @xmath15 being the invariant mass of the system ) .",
    "the problem in introducing the particle motion is that the kinematical corrections implementing it are of the same relative order ( @xmath16 or higher ) as the irreducible dynamical corrections to the einstein deflection . how to disentangle the former terms from the latter ones ?",
    "a hint about solving the question above was provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that  given the particular coulombic form of the leading eikonal  it is possible to take into account the motion of the breit - frame of the particles without affecting the @xmath1-matrix eigenvalue which is still provided by the naive two - dimensional fourier transform .",
    "such observation is the basis for our treatment of motion in sec .",
    "[ s : ilepp ] , which suggests writing a modified metric , which is self - consistent at leading level . the main difference with the previous one  @xcite lies in the introduction of two - body `` shifts '' of t  hooft type  @xcite , summarizing the action of the leading @xmath1-matrix at two - body level .",
    "that is not enough however .",
    "the reduced - action model contains the longitudinal fields @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) characterized by as shock waves centered on the particles with profile functions @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) ; furthermore , it generates a gravitational wave also with a field @xmath21 defined by the h - diagram .",

    "[ s : ssw ] and found to be consistent with as waves  @xcite which are delayed in time and rotated in space , as suggested in sec ..  [ s : ilepp ] . the transverse field ,",
    "on the other hand , provides corrections to the leading eikonal profiles in @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and causes modifications of the metric inside the light - cone by providing important rescattering corrections .",
    "we then set up a perturbative procedure , in order to deal with the self - consistency problem at higher orders in the eikonal expansion . at next order",
    "we find the h - diagram deflection  @xcite which again appears as a feature of the action , but is not incorporated in the metric , which would require further modifications of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the class of multi - h diagrams considered in  @xcite is not sufficient in order to provide a satisfactory metric at this level but we need to go one further step , and calculate rescattering corrections , which carry the information due to two - body shifts for the produced gravitons .",
    "such shifts occur in an approximate solution to the rescattering equations under consideration since a long time  @xcite , which is here worked out to completion in sec .",

    "<S> starting from the acv approach to transplanckian scattering , we present a development of the reduced - action model in which the ( improved ) eikonal representation is able to describe particles motion at large scattering angle and , furthermore , uv - safe ( regular ) rescattering solutions are found and incorporated in the metric . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting particles shock - waves undergo calculable trajectory shifts and time delays during the scattering process  which turns out to be consistently described by both action and metric , up to relative order @xmath0 in the gravitational radius over impact parameter expansion . </S>",
