    "the detection of delayed x - ray , optical and radio emission , `` afterglow '' , following a grb is reasonably described by emission from a spherical relativistic shell , decelerating upon collision with an ambient medium ( waxman 1997a , mszros & rees 1997 , katz & piran 1997 , sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) . a relativistic blast wave is formed and expands through the surrounding medium , heating the matter in it s wake .",
    "the observed afterglow is believed to be due to synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons from the heated matter .",
    "the surrounding medium will be referred to as interstellar medium ( ism ) , though this may not necessarily be the case .    at",
    "any given time , a detector receives photons which were emitted at different times in the observer frame , at different distances behind the shock front and at different angles from the line of sight ( los ) to the center of the grb .",
    "the properties of the matter are different at each of these points , and so are the emissivity and the frequency of the emitted radiation .",
    "early calculations have considered emission from a single representative point ( mszros & rees 1997 , waxman 1997a , sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) . later works",
    "included more detailed calculations .",
    "synchrotron emission was considered from the shock front ( sari 1998 , panaitescu & mszros 1998 ) , and monochromatic emission was considered from a uniform shell ( waxman 1997b ) .",
    "we consider an adiabatic hydrodynamical evolution , and use the adiabatic self similar solution found by blandford and mckee ( 1976 ) for a highly relativistic blast wave expanding into a uniform cold medium , which we will refer to as the bm solution .",
    "we neglect scattering , self absorption and electron cooling .",
    "self absorption becomes important at frequencies much smaller than the peak frequency , and for slow cooling , electron cooling becomes important at frequencies much higher than the peak frequency , so this should yield a good approximation for the observed flux around the peak .",
    "an analysis of the spectrum over a wider range of frequencies was made by sari , piran and narayan ( 1998 ) .    in section 2",
    "we derive the basic formula for the observed flux from a system moving relativistically . in section 3",
    "we consider synchrotron emission from a power law electron distribution , and calculate the observed light curve and spectra .",
    "we show that both the light curve and the spectra are flat near the peak .",
    "this causes difficulty in explaining the shape of the optical peak of grb970508 ( sokolov et .",
    "we obtain expressions for the peak frequency at a given observed time , and for the peak flux . in section 4",
    "we consider three alternative magnetic field models .",
    "we show that the light curve and the spectra remain flat near the peak in all the cases we considered .    in section 5",
    "we calculate the observed light curve and spectra from a locally monochromatic emission .",
    "we consider a uniform shell approximation , which was calculated by waxman ( 1997c ) , and compare the light curve and spectra to those obtained for the bm solution .",
    "we show that a uniform shell approximation yields results which are considerably different from those obtained for a more realistic hydrodynamics , and very different from those obtained for a realistic emission together with a realistic hydrodynamics .    in section 6",
    "we calculate the surface brightness , thus obtaining the observed image of a grb afterglow .",
    "as indicated in previous works ( waxman 1997b ) , sari 1998 , panaitescu & mszros 1998 ) , we obtain from detailed calculations , that the image appears brighter near the edge and dimmer near the center , creating a ring near the outer edge . at a given observed time",
    ", the contrast between the edge and the center of the image is larger and the width of the ring is smaller at high frequencies , while at low frequencies the contrast is smaller and the width of the ring is larger .",
    "we consider a system that is moving relativistically while emitting radiation .",
    "we obtain a formula for the flux that is measured by a distant detector ( i.e. @xmath1 where d is the distance to the detector , and l is the size of the area emitting radiation ) .",
    "we use a spherical coordinate system and place the origin within the emitting region ( i.e. at the source ) , while the z - axis points towards the detector ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the detector is at rest in this frame , and so is the ambient ism .",
    "we refer to this frame as the observer frame .",
    "consider a small volume element @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 ) and let @xmath4 be the energy per unit time per unit volume per unit frequency per unit solid angle , emitted by the matter within this volume in it s local frame ( note that generally @xmath5 depends on the direction @xmath6 as well as on the frequency , place and time ) .",
    "we denote quantities measured in the local rest frame of the matter with a prime , while quantities without a prime are measured in the observer frame .",
    "note that @xmath7 is lorentz invariant ( rybici & lightman 1979 ) and @xmath8 , where @xmath0 and @xmath9 are the lorentz factor and the velocity of the matter emitting the radiation , respectively , and @xmath10 is the cosine of the angle between the direction of the velocity of the matter and the direction to the detector , in the observer frame ) . the contribution to @xmath11 from this volume element",
    "is given by : @xmath12 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",

    ", we calculate the observed flux from emission only along the los .",
    "we do this by considering a situation in which at each point the photons are emitted only radially : @xmath36 .",
    "note that the correct limit is obtained when the delta function in the direction of the emission is taken in the local frame . since @xmath37 ( rybici & lightman 1979 ) we obtain that : @xmath38 substituting this @xmath26 in equation [ flux j ] we obtain : @xmath39    equation [ prefaf ] is quite general , and includes integration over all space . in the case of grb afterglow",
    ", radiation is emitted only from the region behind the shock front .",
    "the spacial integration should therefore be taken over a finite volume , confined by the surface of the shock front .",
    "we would therefore like to obtain an explicit expression for the radius of the shock @xmath40 as a function of @xmath41 for a given arrival time @xmath18 . in the case of a shell moving with a constant velocity @xmath9 ,",
    "one obtains from equation [ time ] : @xmath42 if one considers a constant arrival time @xmath18 , this equation describes an ellipsoid , which confines the volume constituting the locus of points from which photons reach the detector simultaneously ( rees 1966 ) . in grbs ,",
    "most of the matter is concentrated in a thin shell which decelerates upon collision with the ambient medium . when the deceleration of the shell is accounted for ,",
    "the ellipsoid is distorted .",
    "the details of this distortion depend on the evolution of the shock radius @xmath43 ( sari 1998 , panaitescu & mszros 1998 ) . in this paper",
    "we consider an adiabatic ultra - relativistic hydrodynamic solution , which implies @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the lorentz factor of the shock .",
    "for this case , equation [ time ] yields : @xmath46 the shape of the volume constituting the locus of points from which photons reach the detector simultaneously resembles an elongated egg ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) , and will be simply referred to as the `` egg '' . the side facing the observer ( the right side in the figures )",
    "will be referred to as the front of the `` egg '' , and the side closer to the origin ( the left side in the figures ) will be referred to as the back of the `` egg '' .",
    "we see here the egg - shaped region from which photons reach an observer at a given time @xmath18 . in all the figures of the `` egg ''",
    "the observer is located far to the right , and the symmetry axis is the los to the center of the grb . in order to reach the observer simultaneously ,",
    "photons emitted at different locations should be emitted at different times in the observer frame , according to equation [ time ] .",
    "photons that are emitted simultaneously in the observer frame along the dashed - dotted line @xmath47 , reach the observer simultaneously .",
    "therefore @xmath47 represents an equal @xmath48 contour line .",

    ", it is still important to consider the emission from the whole volume of the `` egg '' , whose limits are given by equation [ egg ] . to illustrate this we give a simple example . consider a photon emitted on the los at a distance @xmath56 behind the shock ( point a in figure [ fig2 ] ) at a time @xmath53 in the observer frame , where @xmath57 is the lorentz factor of the matter just behind the shock .",
    "this photon will catch up with the shock front at a later time @xmath54 in the observer frame ( at point b in figure [ fig2 ] ) , and will arrive at the detector together with a photon emitted at that point at @xmath54 . from equation [ egg ]",
    "we find that on the los : @xmath58 , and so we obtain that @xmath59 .",
    "this shows that the emission comes from a substantial part of the volume of the `` egg '' , and not just from a thin layer near it s surface .",
    "this is illustrated by the shaded region in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , which corresponds to a shell of width @xmath60 in the observer frame .    at a given observed time @xmath18",
    ", the emission should be considered from the volume of the `` egg '' whose surface is described by equation [ egg ] . taking this into account ,",
    "it is simpler to calculate the flux at a given observed time @xmath18 , using new variables @xmath61 that depend on @xmath18 ( see figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the radius of the shock front , @xmath64 is the lorentz factor of the matter just behind the shock and @xmath65 is the radius of the point on the shock front , on the los from which a photon reaches the detector at a time @xmath18 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "since we expect the typical size of the emitting region behind the shock , to scale as : @xmath66 , the choice of @xmath51 is natural to this problem . the exact form of @xmath51 was chosen to suit the bm solution , discussed below .",
    "using equation [ time ] we can express @xmath67 in terms of @xmath61 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the lorentz factor of the matter just behind the shock , on the los .",

    "this will enable us to calculate the flux for the bm solution .",

    "the limit @xmath89 corresponds to taking a delta function in @xmath51 : @xmath93 .    in order to single out the effect of the radial integration , we changed variables in equation [ prelos ] from @xmath94 to @xmath51 . for the bm solution",

    "according to the fireball model , a highly relativistic shell moves outward and is decelerated upon collision with the ambient ism .",
    "this creates a relativistic blast wave that expands through the ism and heats up the matter that passes through it .",
    "the relativistic electrons of the heated material emit synchrotron radiation in the presence of a magnetic field .",

    "although we refer to the magnetic field in the local frame , throughout the paper , we make an exception and write it without a prime .",

    "although this emission function was obtained by approximating the spectral emission of each electron as having the shape of the low frequency tail ( @xmath119 ) , the spectral power for the whole electron distribution resembles that obtained for an exact synchrotron emission and an isotropic electron velocity distribution . the solid curve in figure [ fig17 ] represents the local emissivity from an exact synchrotron emission of an isotropic distribution of electrons ( rybici & lightman 1979 , wijers & galama 1998 ) , while the dashed curve represents equation [ emission function ] with : @xmath120 where a factor of @xmath121 was added to improve the fit to the exact synchrotron emission . in our calculations we use the local emission represented by the dashed line in figure [ fig17 ] .",
    "this local emission differs from that of an exact synchrotron emission near the peak , by up to @xmath122 , and is only slightly different above or below the peak .",
    "note that differences in the local emissivity tend to get smeared out , when the contribution to the observed flux is integrated over the whole volume behind the shock front .",
    "we expect that considering exact synchrotron emission should somewhat lower the peak flux and the peak frequency , and make the light curve and spectra more rounded and flat near the peak .",
    "we evaluate that the peak flux would be lower by about @xmath123 .",
    "since there are only slight differences in high and low frequencies , there should hardly be any effect on the value of the point where the extrapolations of the power laws at high and low frequencies meet ( see table 1 ) .",

    "although the hydrodynamic profile is given by the bm solution , the structure and profile of the magnetic field are less clear .",

    "the observed images are quite similar for the different magnetic field models we considered , and therefore we present detailed results only for @xmath111 ( figures [ fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] ) , and summarize the features of the images obtained for @xmath207 , @xmath111 and @xmath208 in table 2 .",
    "the observed image is bright near the edge and dimmer at the center . at high values of @xmath170 ( high frequencies or",
    "late observed times ) the surface brightness at the center is only a few percent of the maximal surface brightness , which is obtained near the edge ( @xmath216 ) , and a bright ring is clearly seen with a sharp edge on the outer side and a more gradual decrease in the surface brightness towards the center . at @xmath173 ( low frequencies or early observed times ) the surface brightness at the center is around @xmath217 of the maximal surface brightness , and though the image is brighter near the edge , the center should be visible as well ( see the left image in figure [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "the transition in the distribution of the relative surface brightness along the observed image , between the limiting cases of small and large @xmath170 , occurs over one order of magnitude in @xmath170 : @xmath218 .",
    "the relative surface brightness hardly changes beyond this region ( though the absolute surface brightness drops both for low and for high values of @xmath170 , due to the drop in the observed flux ) .",
    "the fact that at a given observed time , the relative surface brightness at the center of the image is smaller for high frequencies than it is for low frequencies , may be intuitively understood : for high frequencies the emittance decays in time , and is therefore lower at large radii , which correspond to small values of @xmath219 , which are located at the center of the image .",
    "we have derived a formula for the observed flux from a relativistically moving system . using this formula , we considered the emission from the whole volume behind a spherical relativistic blast wave , expanding into a cold uniform medium .",
    "we have considered an adiabatic evolution and used the self similar hydrodynamical solution of blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) to describe the matter behind the shock .",
    "we have considered synchrotron emission from a power law distribution of electrons , using a realistic local emissivity , which depends on the local hydrodynamic parameters .",
    "we have obtained expressions for the frequency at which the observed flux peaks at a given observed time , and for the value of the peak flux ( equations [ ni peak ] and [ fmax ] ) .",
    "the value we obtained for the peak frequency at a given observed time is a factor of @xmath220 smaller than the value obtained by sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 ) , a factor of @xmath221 ( for @xmath103 ) smaller than the value obtained by wijers & galama ( 1998 ) , and a factor of @xmath222 ( for @xmath103 ) smaller than the value obtained by waxman ( 1997b ) .",
    "the large difference from the result obtained by waxman is partly due to the fact that he took the peak frequency to be at the synchrotron frequency of an average electron @xmath223 , while the peak frequency is actually obtained much closer to @xmath224 , i.e. the synchrotron frequency of an electron with the minimal lorentz factor .",
    "the value we obtained for the peak flux is a factor of @xmath225 ( for @xmath103 ) smaller than the value obtained by wijers & galama ( 1998 ) , a factor of @xmath226 larger than the value obtained by waxman ( 1997b ) , and a factor of @xmath227 smaller than the value obtained by sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 ) .",
    "we have shown that both the light curve and the spectra are flat near the peak .",
    "the flux at a given observed time drops to half it s maximal value at around one order of magnitude from the peak frequency , on either side . the flux at a given observed frequency drops to half it s maximal value at about a factor of @xmath228 before and after the time of the peak flux .",
    "this result was obtained for all the magnetic field models we considered , and it therefore seems to be of quite a general nature .",
    "our calculations were made using an approximation for the local emissivity that is obtained from an exact synchrotron emission .",
    "we expect that without this approximation the values of the peak flux and the peak frequency should be somewhat lower , and the light curve and the spectra should be even more rounded and flat near the peak .",
    "we estimated that these effects should be small .",
    "in contrast to the flatness of the peak , discussed above , grb970508 displayed a sharp rise in the optical flux , immediately followed by a power law decay ( sokolov et .",
    "sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 ) considered both radiative and adiabatic evolution of the blast wave , and found that the steepest rise in the flux occurs before the peak , for an adiabatic evolution and slow cooling of the electrons , which is the case discussed in this paper .",
    "this steepest rise is @xmath229 , and as we have shown in this paper , the rise in the flux decreases as the peak is approached , and the peak itself is quite flat .",
    "we obtained @xmath230 , which indicates a flat peak , while grb970508 displayed @xmath231 .",
    "this rules out the interpretation of the optical peak of grb970508 as the peak of the light curve , predicted by the existing fireball models .",
    "it therefore appears that another explanation is needed .",
    "we have considered a locally monochromatic emission , at the typical synchrotron frequency , obtained from the relevant hydrodynamic parameters .",
    "we have shown that when this emission is applied to the bm solution , the observed flux peaks at the observed emission frequency of the matter just behind the shock , on the los ( @xmath232 ) . there is a sharp drop in the flux below this frequency , and a gradual decrease above it . when this emission is applied to a uniform shell ( waxman 1997b ) the results change drastically .",
    "in particular the location of the peak flux depends critically on the width of the shell @xmath233 ( see equation [ peak flux ] ) , which is chosen quite arbitrarily .",
    "the image of a grb afterglow looks like a ring , even when emission is considered from the whole volume behind the shock front .",
    "similar results were obtained for more simplified models ( waxman 1997b , sari 1998 , panaitescu & mszros 1998 ) .",
    "the image is bright near the edge and dimmer at the center .",
    "the contrast in the surface brightness between the center and the edge of the image is larger for high frequencies ( optical and x - ray ) and the ring is narrower , while for low frequencies ( as long as self absorption is not significant ) the contrast is smaller and the ring is wider .",
    "radio wave - bands can be considered as `` low frequencies '' for the first few months .",
    "the best available resolution is obtained in radio frequencies , and the afterglow of a future nearby grb ( @xmath234 ) might be resolved .",
    "this theory predicts that in early times , when @xmath235 the image should appear as a relatively wide ring with a relatively small contrast , while for later times where @xmath236 ( as long as the relativistic regime is not exceeded ) the image should appear as a narrow ring and posses a large contrast .",
    "the observed image has been calculated , considering emission only from the surface of the shock front ( sari 1998 ) .",
    "this yielded a surface brightness diverging at @xmath237 .",
    "this divergence is an artifact of the assumption that the radiation is emitted from a two dimensional surface .",
    "other features of the image , such as the difference between high and low frequencies , are quite similar in the more simplified analysis .      99 blandford , r. d. & mckee , c. f. 1976 , phys . of fluids,*19",
