    "many structural properties of _ a_-si , such as defect concentration and variation in mean bond angle , are difficult to determine experimentally .",
    "this is because it is impossible to measure directly the coordinates of the atoms in _ a_-si .",
    "however , important information on the structure of _ a_-si can be obtained indirectly , through a number of experimental techniques .",
    "these techniques include neutron , x - ray and raman scattering , electron - spin resonance , and x - ray photo - absorption . compared to other methods ,",
    "raman scattering is more sensitive to small changes in the short - range order of _ a_-si . for this reason , raman measurements on _ a_-si",
    "are frequently used to obtain structural information  @xcite .",
    "the experimental raman spectra of _ a_-si show two distinct peaks , at about 150 @xmath2 and 480 @xmath2 , associated with the transverse acoustic ( ta ) and the transverse optic ( to ) vibrational modes , respectively .",
    "certain features in the raman spectrum are highly sensitive to the structural properties of the _ a_-si sample . for example , the width of the to peak is related to the root - mean - square bond - angle variation @xmath1 in the amorphous network@xcite .    in several computational studies@xcite , the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 was quantified .",
    "all studies indicate a broadening of the to peak with increasing @xmath1 , but there is no quantitative agreement .",
    "beeman s linear relation , @xmath3 , which dates back to 1985 , is often used by experimentalists to determine @xmath1 from raman measurements . here , @xmath0 is in @xmath2 and @xmath1 in degrees .",
    "beeman derived his relation using nine structural models of _ a_-si .",
    "of these models , five were generated from the same 238-atom , hand - built model by connell and temkin@xcite , which contains only even - membered rings .",
    "in contrast , all simulations on _ a_-si find an abundance of five- and seven - fold rings .",
    "moreover , these five connell - temkin models are statistically dependent and not periodic , consequently containing a large fraction of surface atoms .",
    "experimental values of @xmath1 , based on the radial distribution function of _",
    "a_-si obtained in neutron - diffraction studies , range from 9.9 to 11.0 degrees@xcite . of the nine structural models used by beeman , only three exhibit values of @xmath1 in this range .",
    "new techniques to generate _ a_-si structures , such as art  @xcite , as well as more powerful computers , have made it possible to generate larger and more realistic _",
    "a_-si systems via computer simulation .",
    "also the description of the raman scattering process has improved .",
    "beeman used the bond polarizibility model proposed by alben _",
    "et al._@xcite , which dates back to 1975 .",
    "characteristic for this model is the inclusion of three weighting parameters , whose values must be set somewhat arbitrarily .",
    "several studies have indicated that the values originally proposed by alben yield an incorrect value for the depolarization ratio  @xcite .",
    "these studies therefore propose different weights .",
    "since then , other polarizibility models have been proposed , for example by marinov and zotov  @xcite .    in this manuscript , we will re - investigate the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 by computer simulation .",
    "this simulation is based on a large number of 1000-atom , periodic configurations , with structural properties ( radial distribution function , spread in mean bond angle ) that are in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "furthermore , recent advances in neutron scattering techniques have made it possible to directly compare the bond polarizibility models to experiment  @xcite .",
    "we therefore also include a detailed comparison of the model of alben and the model of marinov and zotov to experiment .    additionally , we present two other methods to obtain structural information from the raman spectrum .",
    "the ta / to intensity ratio  @xcite and the location of the to - peak  @xcite are believed to be directly related to @xmath1 ; these relations will be quantified .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : method ] , we explain the generation of the _ a_-si configurations used in this study .",
    "we then discuss how the raman spectrum is obtained from these configurations .",
    "the results and conclusions are presented in sections [ sect : results ] and [ sect : conclusions ] , respectively .",
    "to calculate raman spectra , three ingredients are required : ( 1 ) a potential describing the atomic interactions in the sample , ( 2 ) a continuous random network representing a realistic sample of _",
    "a_-si , and ( 3 ) a model assigning raman activities to the vibrational eigenmodes of the sample .    in the present work , we use a modified version of the stillinger - weber potential for all calculations .",
    "this potential has the same functional form as the original sw potential  @xcite , but with different parameters .",
    "the parameters were chosen specifically to describe _",
    "a_-si , see ref .",
    "@xcite .      to study the effect of @xmath1 on the raman spectrum , we require a number of _ a_-si configurations with varying values of @xmath1 .",
    "these configurations were generated using the activation - relaxation technique ( art )  @xcite . as was shown in previous studies  @xcite ,",
    "art yields structures in good agreement with experiment .",
    "they display a low density of coordination defects , a narrow bond - angle distribution and an excellent overlap with the experimental radial distribution function ( rdf ) .",
    "the method is outlined below :    1 .",
    "initially , 1000 atoms are placed at random in a periodic cubic cell ; the configuration is then relaxed at zero pressure .",
    "2 .   the configuration is annealed using art .",
    "one art move consists of two steps : ( 1 ) the sample is brought from a local energy minimum to a nearby saddle - point ( activation ) , and ( 2 ) then relaxed to a new minimum with a local energy minimization scheme including volume optimization , at zero pressure .",
    "the new minimum is accepted with a metropolis probability at temperature @xmath4 ev .",
    "3 .   every 50 art moves , up to approximately five art moves per atom when the energy has reached a plateau , the configuration is stored . for 1000-atom samples ,",
    "this procedure yields a set containing 100 samples .",
    "this procedure is repeated nine times , generating nine statistically independent sets of 100 correlated configurations each . for each set",
    ", we found that @xmath1 ranges from approximately 10@xmath5 for the well - annealed configurations , to approximately 14@xmath5 for the poorly annealed configurations .",
    "we focus on the reduced raman spectrum @xmath6 , with thermal and harmonic oscillator factors removed .",
    "this spectrum is a function of frequency @xmath7 and of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) and @xmath10 a coupling parameter , which depends on frequency and on the polarization ( hh or hv ) of the incident light used in the raman experiment .    to calculate the vdos ,",
    "the hessian is calculated .",
    "diagonalization of the hessian gives the frequencies of the vibrational modes , from which the vdos is obtained .",

    "we have checked that the general features of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling ] do not depend on the details of the configuration used : a number of other , well - annealed , configurations , with @xmath1 ranging from 10.0@xmath41 to 11.0@xmath41 , gave similar results .",
    "[ fig : coupling ] shows that both models yield an increasing coupling parameter for frequencies up to around 500 @xmath2 .",

    "this is not confirmed by experiment .",
    "the quantitative agreement with experiment is rather poor , especially in the low - frequency regime ; both models provide substantially less activity in this regime than observed in experiment .",
    "for this reason , raman spectra calculated using either of the two models yield ta peak amplitudes far below experimental values .",

    "a_-si sample is used to calculate the vdos and experimental data is used to describe the coupling parameter .",
    "this approach is justified because several studies have indicated that changes in the raman spectrum are due to changes in the vdos and not to changes in the coupling parameter  @xcite .",
    "the results of this approach are illustrated in the bottom graph of fig .",

    "of the two models considered here , the mz model provides slightly more activity in the low - frequency regime than the model of alben ; comparison with experiment would therefore favor the mz model .",

    "the intensity of the raman to peak decreases abruptly on the high frequency side , but not on the low frequency side .",
