    "an inflationary epoch of the early universe is widely accepted as the most efficient mechanism to solve the flatness and the horizon problem , while providing a nearly scale invariant spectrum of scalar perturbations , in agreement with observations .",
    "however , the embedding of inflation driven by a single scalar field within string theory ( presently , the only known self - consistent theory of quantum gravity ) has proven to be challenging , since it requires an extremely flat potential .",
    "in addition , the presence of many dynamic fields in string theory renders single field models less appealing because all but one degree of freedom need to be already stabilized at the onset of inflation .",
    "though far from being simple or generic , a partially successful implementation is the kklmmt construction @xcite .    to ameliorate the problem of fine tuning the potential , liddle et .",
    "al .  proposed assisted inflation in @xcite ( see also @xcite and follow ups ) , a certain type of multi - field inflation whereby the presence of many fields increases the hubble friction , allowing for steeper potentials to still drive slow roll inflation .",
    "one shortcoming , however , is the need for fine tuned initial conditions for particular potentials , especially in the absence of an attractor solution ( for instance in n - flation @xcite ; see @xcite for a more general stability analysis of assisted inflation ) .",
    "the presence of many degrees of freedom in string theory has , over the years , galvanized the emergence of a variety of models implementing assisted inflation ; these include inflation from multiple tachyons @xcite , from multiple m5-branes within m - theory @xcite or from axions @xcite among others , see e.g. @xcite for a small selection .",
    "to make predictions in these models , it is common to introduce a single effective degree of freedom , visualized as the length of the trajectory in field space , see e.g. the review @xcite . utilizing this approach correctly recovers adiabatic perturbations , but not isocurvature / entropy modes .",
    "the latter ones can be pictured as perturbations perpendicular to the trajectory and develop whenever several degrees of freedom are present @xcite .",
    "although non - gaussianities may be produced ( see the review @xcite for details ) , it is possible to show that they are generically slow roll suppressed @xcite ( see however @xcite ) . with this in mind , is it then feasible to discriminate a given multi - field model from its single field analog ?    in this article , we investigate a , so far largely ignored ( see however @xcite ) , discriminating property of multi - field models , namely the possibility that fields decay during inflation . by `` decay '' we mean that individual fields suddenly become obsolete , while their energy is converted into other forms , such as radiation .",
    "this is a widespread feature of models within string theory : consider , for instance , an association of inflatons with distances between branes that are located in some internal space .",
    "if a brane annihilates during inflation , for example as a result of its dissolution into a boundary brane or a collision with an anti - brane , the distance to the just mentioned brane becomes meaningless .",
    "of course , energy does not vanish , but is converted into a different type during the annihilation .",
    "a further example is inflation driven by tachyons , which can condense during inflation in a staggered fashion .",
    "the disappearance of fields causes an additional decrease of the potential energy during inflation , which can be even more important than the reduction of potential energy induced by slow roll .",
    "hence , leading order corrections to observable parameters that are sensitive to the slow roll parameters , such as the scalar spectral index , are possible .",
    "indeed , one can construct models of inflation entirely without a slow roll phase , similar to inflation without inflatons as proposed in @xcite .    in order to compute these effects",
    "we assume a simple separable potential @xmath0 and promote the number of fields @xmath1 to a time dependent function .",
    "we further smooth out @xmath1 so that we can introduce a continuous decay rate @xmath2 .",
    "this approach is only justified if the number of fields and @xmath3 are large enough so that several fields disappear in any given hubble time .",
    "further , any signal due to a rapid drop in the potential energy , such as a ringing in the power spectrum or additional non - gaussianities @xcite , can not be recovered by this approach . to guarantee energy - momentum conservation ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "we are forced to introduce an additional component of the total energy momentum tensor that takes over the energy of the disappearing fields .",
    "the ratio of its energy density to the one in the remaining inflatons yields an additional small parameter @xmath5 appearing alongside the usual slow roll parameters . as a consequence , the equation of motion of the effective field is modified .",
    "the resulting set - up is reminiscent of warm inflation @xcite , and might indeed be seen as a new , less problematic implementation of warm inflation within string theory .    at the perturbed level",
    ", we consider adiabatic and entropy perturbations and show that the latter ones are suppressed in the models of interest .",
    "focusing on the mukhanov variable , we derive the scalar spectral index and its running for general decay rates and number of fields .",
    "we recover the usual slow roll result as well as @xcite ( a dynamically relaxing cosmological constant ) in the appropriate limits , but we also find leading order corrections to the slow roll result in general .",
    "the running remains second order in small parameters and is , therefore , too small to be observed .    to exemplify the applicability of the formalism we make a detailed study of three concrete models ; firstly , as an instructive toy model , we consider assisted inflation with exponential potentials and a nonzero , constant decay rate , which we insert by hand .",
    "@xmath6 provides a graceful exit to inflation at the cost of requiring somewhat flatter potentials or more fields so that the model remains consistent with observations .",
    "if the decay rate is too big ( @xmath7 ) the scalar spectral index becomes unacceptably red , but all smaller rates work well .",
    "secondly , we investigate inflation from multiple tachyons , as proposed in @xcite . here",
    ", tachyons get displaced from the top of their potential by thermal or quantum mechanical fluctuations , causing them to condense during inflation .",
    "we find that the best motivated and least fine tuned setup consists of a constant decay rate and tachyons close to the top of their potential so that their slow roll evolution yields negligible contributions to observable parameters .",
    "the resulting spectral index is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number efolds at which we evaluate @xmath10 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the observations of the cmbr , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "lastly , we look at inflation from multiple m-5 branes within m - theroy @xcite . here , inflatons are associated with the inter - brane distance between m5-branes located within an orbifold @xmath12 .",
    "whenever a brane comes close to a boundary brane it dissolves into the boundary via a small instanton transition . given the model s parameter ranges , which encompass , for instance , the concrete potential and the maximal number of branes , we show that inflation comes to an end within a few efolds after the first outermost brane disintegrates .",
    "hence , only an initial narrow stacking of branes ( involves fine tuning ) permits a consistent scenario , and the usual slow roll expressions apply . based upon these findings ,",
    "cascade inflation as investigated in @xcite is irrelevant for the cosmological scales that are observed in the cmbr , given the parameters put forward in @xcite .",
    "it is evident that whether or not corrections due to @xmath6 are important is model - dependent , ranging from being the primary ingredient , as in the tachyon case , to being not pertinent , as in the m5-brane case .",
    "thus , the many implementations of multi - field inflation within string theory should be thoroughly re - investigated .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : main ] , we derive the formalism to deal with dacaying fields , at the background level ( sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] ) and the perturbed one ( sec .",
    "[ sec : spectralindex ] ) .",
    "we compute the spectral index and the running in section [ sec : spectralindex ] and [ sec : running ] . along the way",
    ", we draw comparisons to warm inflation in section [ sec : warm ] and comment on isocurvature modes as well as non - gaussianities in section [ sec : entropy ] .",
    "we then shift gears and focus on applications , that is we investigate concrete models : assisted inflation ( sec .  [",
    "sec : staggered ] ) , inflation from tachyons ( sec .",
    "[ sec : acdmm ] ) and inflation from multiple m5-branes ( sec .",
    "[ sec : bbk ] ) ; summaries of the conclusions for each model can be found at the end of their respective subsection .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "consider @xmath1 scalar fields with canonical kinetic terms and a separable potential @xmath0 , is not the susy superpotential . ]",
    "so that the action reads @xmath13 for ease of notation , we set the reduced planck mass equal to one throughout @xmath14 .",
    "assume that the fields all evolve according to the same potential @xmath15 and that they start out from an identical initial value , so that @xmath16 in this case , an effective single field model with @xmath17 and @xmath18 describes correctly the inflationary phase ( if @xmath19 is sufficiently flat ) as well as the production of adiabatic perturbations ( we comment on entropy perturbations in section [ sec : entropy ] ) .",
    "to guarantee slow roll inflation , we demand @xmath20 where a prime on @xmath21 or @xmath22 denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath23 or @xmath24 respectively .",
    "so far , this is merely a simple model of assisted inflation @xcite , see also @xcite and follow ups .    given this setup ,",
    "we would like to investigate the consequences of individual fields @xmath23 dropping out of the model , more or less instantaneously . by dropping out we mean that a field decays while its energy is converted into a different form , for example radiation .",
    "this may seem artificial at first glance , but it is actually quite generic in multi - field models of inflation within string theory .",
    "for instance , in the model of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the inflatons are related to the distances between adjacent m5-branes .",
    "these branes are located along an orbifold @xmath25 and slowly separate from each other in the orbifold direction , corresponding to the inflationary phase in the effective four dimensional description .",
    "since the orbifold is quasi - static during this regime , the outermost branes will collide with the orbifold - fixed planes at some point in time , dissolving into the boundaries through small instanton transitions .",
    "thus , the degrees of freedom associated with the distances to these just dissolved branes become obsolete during inflation . of course",
    ", the energy associated with the branes does not vanish , but gets converted to other degrees of freedom , such as radiation .",
    "another example is inflation driven by multiple tachyons as proposed in @xcite ; here , tachyons roll slowly away from the top of their potential , but fluctuations may displace a given field far enough to condense suddenly , again making obsolete this degree of freedom during inflation .",
    "we come back to these two concrete models later on , after developing the formalism to deal with decaying fields . for additional multi - field models see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for a review .",
    "it is worth stressing at this point that the disappearance of a given field in the models considered in this paper is a sudden , but continuous process .",
    "this means potential problems associated with first order phase transitions , as discussed in some detail in @xcite , are absent . to model the disappearance of individual fields we promote @xmath1 to a time dependent function .",
    "we further smooth out , we will not be able to recover additional features in the power - spectrum that are directly related to sudden drops in the potential .",
    "for instance , features could consist of a ringing or additional non - gaussianities @xcite .",
    "however , such signals depend crucially on the detailed physics of the fields dissapearance , a rather badly understood and model dependent issue for the current generation of setups . as a consequence",
    ", these features will be quite hard to estimate within an effective single field description and we will not address them further in this article . ]",
    "@xmath26 so that we can introduce a continuous decay rate @xmath27 , which is to be determined from the underlying model . this smoothing is the key simplifying assumption in our approach , and it is only viable if the number of fields is large and the decay rate is such that within any given hubble time a few fields become obsolete . for the cases we are interested in",
    ", this rate is small compared to the hubble parameter @xmath28 during inflation ( inflation ends quickly otherwise ) .",
    "this means we can introduce the small parameter @xmath29    the time dependence of @xmath1 induces an additional decrease in the energy of the effective inflaton . to be concrete",
    ", the continuity equation of @xmath24 needs to be modified to account for the energy loss in the inflaton sector due to decaying fields @xmath30 , so that @xmath31 here and throughout the subscript @xmath24 denotes the entire inflaton sector .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that the individual @xmath23 evolve according to the standard slow roll equation of motion @xmath32 , as long as they are present . to retain @xmath33 ,",
    "we must allow for an additional component @xmath34 within the energy budget , so that energy always flows from the inflaton field sector into @xmath35 . ] satisfying @xmath36 we use the subscript `` @xmath37 '' , since we have radiation in mind ( @xmath38 with @xmath39 ) ; this choice seems most natural to us , considering the models we are interested in , but to remain as general as possible we keep @xmath40 arbitrary throughout .",
    "the condition @xmath41 implies that @xmath34 makes up only a small fraction of the total energy density during inflation .",
    "thus , we may introduce the small parameter @xmath42 naturally , @xmath5 is not independent of @xmath43 , and one can show under mild assumptions that @xmath44 during inflation ( see below ) .",
    "further , using slow roll of the individual fields @xmath23 , one can show that the total energy and pressure of the effective inflaton obey @xmath45 .",
    "this , along with @xmath38 and the definitions above , leads to @xmath46 during slow roll ( the `` @xmath47 '' always denotes equality to first order in small parameters such as @xmath48 or @xmath5 ) . taking the derivative with respect to time of the friedmann equation @xmath49 and using ( [ cont1 ] ) as well as ( [ cont2 ] ) , yields the _ hubble slow roll parameter _ @xmath50 this explains the chosen pre - factors in ( [ defepsilonn ] ) and ( [ defbarepsilon ] ) , as well as our demand that all epsilons should be small .",
    "we have carefully avoided the use of the klein gordon equation for @xmath24 , since it gets modified by the presence of @xmath6 . to derive this modification",
    ", one can use @xmath51 in the continuity equation ( [ cont1 ] ) and make the usual slow roll approximations , or take the time derivative of @xmath52 directly with @xmath53 so that @xmath54 where we introduced the short hand notation @xmath55 as expected , the usual slow roll equation of motion is recovered from ( [ eomsrvarphi ] ) in the limit @xmath56 .",
    "the limit @xmath57 , that is @xmath58 , corresponds to a dynamically relaxing cosmological constant , which is discussed in great detail in @xcite .    during inflation , @xmath28 , @xmath43 as well as",
    "@xmath59 change very slowly , so that ( [ cont2 ] ) can be integrated to @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "this means that the additional component of the energy budget approaches a scaling solution @xmath62 for which @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "thus , we can use @xmath65 during inflation .      at this point",
    ", we would like to comment on similarities to warm inflation @xcite , where the scalar field s interaction with other particles ( through which the scalar field transfers some of its energy into a thermal bath ) prevents the temperature from rapidly reaching zero .",
    "within warm inflation , the motion of the scalar field is described by the modified klein - gordon equation ( assuming slow roll ) @xmath66 the extra friction term @xmath67 represents an additional energy loss of the scalar field @xmath24 stemming from particle creation .",
    "this equation needs to be compared to our equation ( [ eomsrvarphi ] ) : in our case , an increase / decrease of the right hand side is present , depending on the sign of @xmath68 , while in ( [ eom_wi ] ) , the right hand side is always decreased by @xmath69 .    a more concrete realization of warm inflation based on thermal viscosity has been ( critically ) examined in @xcite . in this study ,",
    "part of the inflaton s energy is converted into radiation through a viscosity term .",
    "as a consequence , one can show that the energy density satisfies @xmath70 with @xmath71 . comparing ( [ energy_density_wi ] ) to our case ( [ energy_density ] ) we see a similar modification : an additional positive term , potentially counterbalancing the dilution of @xmath34 due to redshifting ; however , the origin of this term differs : in our case it is due to the transfer of potential energy , whereas that of ( [ energy_density_wi ] ) arises from infusing kinetic energy .",
    "though the friction term in ( [ energy_density_wi ] ) could at first glance be large enough to allow for successful warm inflation , a more careful examination by yokoyama and linde revealed @xcite that warm inflation is not feasible in this framework , since @xmath24 changes significantly over the relaxation time of the relevant particles , violating an adiabaticity condition required for the validity of ( [ energy_density_wi ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , albeit the presence of many problems like the one just mentioned , warm inflation remains an active field of research .",
    "staggered multi - field inflation , as introduced in the present paper , might be seen as an independent ( less problematic ) realization of warm inflation , which can be embedded into string theory .      in order to compute the scalar spectral index we focus on adiabatic perturbations , that is , for the time being we neglect isocurvature perturbations",
    "the latter ones arise due to the presence of the many scalar fields and @xmath34 , but one can show that they are suppressed during inflation .",
    "the applicability of this approximation is discussed in section [ sec : entropy ] .",
    "the canonical degree of freedom that diagonalizes the action of adiabatic scalar perturbations is the mukhanov variable @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "it is related to the curvature perturbation on uniform density hyper - surfaces @xmath73 via @xmath74 where @xmath75 here , @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the equation of state parameter , while @xmath79 is the adiabatic sound speed , which becomes @xmath80 on large scales . in terms of @xmath81 ,",
    "the power spectrum is given by @xmath82 and the scalar spectral index is @xmath83 the mukhanov variable satisfies the simple equation of motion @xcite @xmath84 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",

    "since @xmath153 , the relative non - adiabatic pressure perturbation is heavily suppressed and can safely be ignored during inflation . remains small and finite in the limit of small @xmath152 , because the curvature perturbations @xmath154 and @xmath155 remain small ; see @xcite . ]    second , consider the intrinsic contributions @xmath156 since @xmath157 we have @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",

    "but if we look at the relative non - adiabatic pressure contributions between the fields @xmath167 we conclude that @xmath168 since @xmath169 .",
    "thus , the total non - adiabatic pressure is negligible during inflation and we are justified to focus on adiabatic perturbations . @xcite . ]",
    "these are correctly recovered by focusing on the mukhanov variable @xmath72 , as we did in section [ sec : spectralindex ] .",
    "one further comment might be in order : due to the suppression of entropy perturbations during inflation , we do not expect any large additional non - gaussianities ( ng ) caused by @xmath6 .",
    "further , since multi - field inflationary models generically yield comparable ng to their single field analogs @xcite , and ng are suppressed during slow roll inflation ( see however @xcite ) , we do not expect any measurable ng within the setups discussed in this paper .",
    "one caveat to this argument consists of the short intervals whenever one of the inflaton fields decays ( see e.g. @xcite for ng from steps in a potential in single field inflation ) .",
    "we can not exclude the production of ng at these instances , but we do not anticipate them either , because the process is very similar to preheating and generically , preheating ( e.g. instant preheating ) does not cause large ng @xcite ( see however the possibility of larger ng in tachyonic preheating @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , given a better microphysical understanding of how inflatons become obsolete , e.g. by investigating the brane annihilation in @xcite , one can and should check the validity of this expectation .",
    "we would like to compute the scalar spectral index in ( [ finalns ] ) and the running in ( [ finalrunning ] ) within a couple of models .",
    "first , we extend assisted inflation with exponential potentials @xcite by incorporating a non - zero @xmath3 , which provides a graceful exit of inflation ; this phenomenological model has the advantage of being instructive and simple .",
    "next , we consider two concrete models @xcite which have the feature of decaying fields during inflation already build in , at the price of being more complicated to treat .",
    "our approach consists of extracting the potential slow roll parameters @xmath101 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 , as well as @xmath172 with @xmath173 in order to apply ( [ finalns ] ) and ( [ finalrunning ] ) .",
    "consider the original proposal of assisted inflation @xcite , where the @xmath1 scalar fields have identical exponential potentials @xmath174 so that the potential for the single effective field @xmath175 reads @xmath176 with @xmath177 ( we assume identical initial values for all @xmath23 ) .",
    "power law inflation ( @xmath178 ) results for large enough @xmath179 , which can be achieved even with steep potentials if @xmath180 .",
    "note that the single field solution is an attractor during inflation @xcite ( see @xcite for a general discussion of stability in multi - field inflation ) .",
    "the slow roll parameters in the above model are @xmath181 so that the scalar spectral index is @xmath182 if @xmath118 ( see @xcite or equation ( [ finalns ] ) ) ; in addition , the running is zero since @xmath183 .",
    "however , the above model has a graceful exit problem : inflation never ends because @xmath101 and @xmath170 are constant .",
    "this problem can be alleviated by introducing a non - zero @xmath3 , so that the number of fields decreases during inflation .",
    "let s for simplicity take a constant rate @xmath112 so that @xmath111",
    ". consequently , inflation comes to an end when @xmath184 becomes of order one , at which point @xmath1 decreases rapidly during a hubble time so that the assistance effect diminishes .    since a shift in the individual fields @xmath185 can be absorbed into a redefinition of @xmath186 , we can set @xmath187 at @xmath188 efolds before the end of inflation , without loss of generality .",

    "note that this prediction is only valid as long as branes are not dissolving into the boundary branes , that is as long as the distance between adjacent branes satisfies @xmath319 .",
    "in @xcite it was also suggested that one could distribute the m5-branes uniformly over the interval in order to avoid the fine - tuning associated with the narrow stacking of branes .",
    "the number of branes is bounded by the brane separation via @xmath320 , and whenever @xmath321 a brane dissoves into a boundary brane , decreasing @xmath1 by one . in terms of @xmath322 the effective field",

    "note that whenever @xmath1 decreases , @xmath24 makes a jump due to the decreased @xmath179 , whereas @xmath322 is continuous ( we do not perform any smoothing of @xmath26 in this section ) .",
    "let us consider the following question in order to assess whether or not we need to consider effects caused by a decreasing number of m5-branes : if we have indeed a narrow stack of @xmath325 branes initially , how many efolds follow after the outermost m5-brane hits one of the boundary branes ?",
    "if the number of efolds @xmath326 that follow up until @xmath327 ( at which point @xmath101 becomes of order one and slow roll inflation ends ) is small , the above fixed-@xmath1 result is applicable . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath328 , one can not ignore the time dependence of @xmath1 and cascade - inflation @xcite results . to address this question ,",
    "we assume that the stack of branes is located near the center of the orbifold , so that the branes are uniformly distributed over the whole orbifold when the first brane dissolves into a boundary brane . during slow roll ,",
    "@xmath326 is easily computed from @xmath329 where @xmath330 and the integration boundaries follow from @xmath331 with @xmath332 , @xmath333 and @xmath334 ( which remains constant during each integration interval ) as @xmath335 since the integrand is constant during each interval , we get @xmath336\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath337 is the digamma function ( the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function ) . for large @xmath338 ,",
    "this can be approximated by @xmath339 , that is @xmath340 for @xmath325 .",
    "hence , inflation comes to an end shortly after the first m5-brane dissolves into the boundary brane and we are justified to use the fixed-@xmath1 result for @xmath10 .",
    "further , since all branes dissolve within the last few efolds , we expect all of them to contribute to reheating .",
    "one might wonder how many branes are needed to achieve @xmath188 if one starts out with a uniform distribution of m5-branes over the entire orbifold ( instead of a narrow stack of branes ) as mentioned in @xcite . solving @xmath341 for the number of branes",
    "yields @xmath342 , which is unfortunately well outside the allowed interval for @xmath1 .",
    "thus , such an initial uniform distribution is not feasible within the framework of @xcite , and the investigation of @xcite ( where @xmath343 and @xmath344 as well as @xmath345 are considered ) is strictly speaking not applicable either : any imprint onto fluctuations within the last few efolds of inflation does not correspond to the large scales observed in , e.g. the cmbr .",
    "however , it should be noted that other values of @xmath346 and @xmath347 seem possible @xcite so that cascade - inflation might be important in different scenarios .",
    "we leave this interesting possibility to future studies .",
    "were within the allowed interval , one could not simply invoke the formalism of section [ sec : main ] , since the potential differs from the type we considered in that it is not a simple sum , for instance @xmath348 instead of @xmath349 .",
    "therefore , one would have to adjust the formalism accordingly first . ]    to summarize , in the model of @xcite and adhering to the prefered parameter ranges , successful inflation can only be driven if the branes are stacked narrowly ( this involves fine - tuning ) ; then @xmath350 , so that about @xmath351 branes are needed in order to match observations .",
    "as soon as the outermost m5-branes dissolve into the boundary branes , inflation comes to an end within a few efolds due to the rapidly decreasing number of branes . as a consequence , all branes should contribute to reheating .",
    "in this study , we investigated the consequences of disappearing inflatons during multi - field inflation .",
    "such a process occurs quite naturally in string theoretical models of multi - field inflation , for instance if the inflatons are associated with inter - brane distances and said branes start to annihilate during inflation , or if inflatons are identified with tachyons that condense in a staggered fashion .",
    "focusing on inflationary models with separable potentials , we promoted the number of fields to a time dependent , continuous variable and derived the general formalism at the background and perturbed level to allow for a non - zero decay rate .",
    "this approach is only valid if the number of fields is large and the decay rate is big enough so that at least a few fields drop out of the model in a given hubble time . to satisfy conservation of the energy momentum tensor , an additional component to the energy budget needs to be introduced , which takes over the energy of the decaying fields .",
    "a non - zero decay rate can cause leading order corrections in observable quantities such as the scalar spectral index or the running , for which we derived general expressions .",
    "we recovered standard slow roll results and the case of a dynamically relaxing cosmological constant of @xcite in the appropriate limits .",
    "in addition , we showed that isocurvature modes are generically suppressed during inflation for the models of interest ; as a consequence , perturbations are adiabatic and nearly gaussian .",
    "we also point out that staggered multi - field inflation might be seen as a new , less problematic type of warm inflation , which can be implemented within string theory .",
    "based on our formalism , we investigated three concrete models : assisted inflation with exponential potentials @xcite , inflation from multiple tachyons @xcite , and inflation from multiple m5-branes @xcite .",
    "for assisted inflation , the presence of a non - zero decay rate offers a graceful exit to inflation , while remaining observationally viable . for inflation from multiple tachyons ,",
    "the use of our formalism offers a reliable method to compute the scalar spectral index ; we concluded that the setup with best computational control , minimal fine - tuning and good agreement with observations consists of a constant decay rate slightly below one , a few hundred tachyons and a negligible slow roll contribution . for inflation from multiple m5-branes , we showed that the dissolution of m5-branes into boundary branes is quite rapid within the allowed parameter ranges .",
    "therefore , inflation comes to an end within a few efolds after the first m5-branes disappear .",
    "hence , the only self consistent setup employs a ( fine - tuned ) narrow stack of branes , whose number is constant around the pivot scale for which the scalar spectral index is measured , and the standard slow roll result is applicable .",
    "we did not investigate further the connection to warm inflation , since it would go beyond the scope of this article , but it is surely an avenue worth investigating more thoroughly .",
    "further , our selection of models is not extensive , and had the primary purpose of exemplifying the applicability of the formalism in a few concrete , distinct scenarios . variations of the models discussed here ( and also entirely different ones ) are abundant in the literature and should be re - examined .",

    "<S> we investigate multi - field inflationary scenarios with fields that drop out of the model in a staggered fashion . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is natural in certain multi - field inflationary setups within string theory ; for instance , it can manifest itself when fields are related to tachyons that condense , or inter - brane distances that become meaningless when branes annihilate . considering a separable potential , and promoting the number of fields to a smooth time - dependent function </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the formalism to deal with these models at the background and perturbed level , providing general expressions for the scalar spectral index and the running . </S>",
    "<S> we recover known results of e.g. a dynamically relaxing cosmological constant in the appropriate limits . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that isocurvature perturbations are suppressed during inflation , so that perturbations are adiabatic and nearly gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting setup might be interpreted as a novel type of warm inflation , readily implemented within string theory and without many of the shortcomings associated with warm inflation .    to exemplify the applicability of the formalism we consider three concrete models : assisted inflation with exponential potentials as a simple toy model ( a graceful exit becomes possible ) , inflation from multiple tachyons ( a constant decay rate of the number of fields and negligible slow roll contributions turns out to be in good agreement with observations ) and inflation from multiple m5-branes within m - theory ( a narrow stacking of branes yields a consistent scenario ) . </S>"
