    "the rise of the proton - proton cross section ( total , inelastic ) as the interaction energy increases is an important feature of the strong interaction picture .",
    "the growth itself is established quite well both from theoretical and experimental point of view .",
    "however the question how fast do cross sections rise is discussed permanently .",
    "a definite answer is still lacking .",
    "theoretical predictions agree well with one another and with accelerator data in the region where data exist ( @xmath0 gev ) but they differ above taht level .",
    "before the large hadron collider lhc@xcite shifts the direct measurements limit to 10 @xmath1 14 tev the only existing information comes from the cosmic ray extensive air shower ( eas ) data .",
    "two eas experiments , akeno @xcite and fly s eye @xcite , gave estimations of proton  proton total cross section at about @xmath2 gev .",
    "the important difference between the collider and eas proton ",
    "proton cross section measurements is that in fact the proton  air interactions are involved in the eas development .",
    "thus the value which is real measured is the cross section for the interactions with air nuclei .",
    "the value of proton  proton cross section is then obtained using a theory for nuclei interactions . in many recent papers concerning this subject",
    "one finds only a brief reference such as `` calculations have been made in the standard glauber formalism '' or something very similar @xcite .    the original glauber paper @xcite was published over 40 years ago and it appears that since then some misunderstandings have arisen .",
    "rather complicated equations for scattering cross sections can be simplified significantly applying some additional assumptions  of limited validity .",
    "it was pointed out in 1970 @xcite that some expressions which are most frequently identified with the nuclear optical model should not be used at least for light nuclei , yet this still sometimes happens nowadays .    in this paper",
    "we compare results of calculations with and without mentioned simplifications .",
    "we will shown that there is quite significant difference between them .",
    "the exact glauber formalism will be used to evaluate the proton  proton cross section values from the akeno and fly s eye data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section a detail description of proton  proton scattering ,",
    "the basis of further nuclei cross section calculations , is given . in section 3 the proton - nucleus cross section evaluation for some commonly used methods",
    "is given , and in section 4 the quantitative results are presented and discussed .",
    "introducing the impact parameter formalism cross sections can be described using one , in general complex , function @xmath3 in the form    @xmath4 d^2 { \\bf b}~~ , \\nonumber \\\\ { \\sigma}_{\\rm el}~=~\\int\\:\\left| \\:1\\:-\\:{\\rm e}^{i \\chi ( { b})}\\:\\right|   ^2\\ : d^2 { \\bf b}~~ , \\label{sigsig } \\nonumber \\\\ { \\sigma}_{\\rm inel}~=~\\int\\:1\\:-\\:\\left| \\:{\\rm e}^{i \\chi ( { b})}\\:\\right|   ^2\\ : d^2 { \\bf b } ~~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the phase shift @xmath3 is related to the scattering amplitude by the two - dimensional fourier transform    @xmath5    using the optical analogy one can interpret the @xmath6 function as a transmission coefficient for a given impact parameter . considering two colliding object we can assume ( for pure absorptive potential )    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is a particle s `` opaqueness '' ( the matter density integrated along the collision axis ) .",
    "to some extend the hadronic matter density could be identified with the charge density measured precisely in the leptonic - scattering experiments .",
    "however , for high - energy hadron  hadron collisions the real part of the phase shift @xmath3 can be considerable .",
    "also , the simple interpretation given in eq.([rho ] ) ought to be modified  at least , by introducing some dependence on the interaction energy ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "thus the general phase shift @xmath3 is a two - variable complex function .",
    "two possible ways of simplifying the situation have been proposed in the literature : the factorization hypothesis ( fh ) and geometrical scaling ( gs ) .",
    "they can be expressed as    @xmath10    from the optical point of view , the fh means that the hadron is getting blacker as the energy increases while the gs means that it is getting bigger .",
    "the bulk of information about the hadron phase - shift function @xmath3 comes from elastic scattering experiments : more precisely , from the measured differential elastic cross section .",
    "the value of the total cross section can be obtained from the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude using the optical theorem .",
    "analysis of the elastic data above @xmath11 gev shows that neither assumption given in eq.([gsfh ] ) is realized exactly ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) .",
    "however , a combination of the two can reproduce the data quite well .    in this paper the form of @xmath3",
    "is assumed after @xcite in the form    @xmath12    [ with @xmath13 defined by eq.([rho ] ) ] .",
    "this follows the original gs idea @xcite and differs from the known martin formula where the ratio of real to imaginary part of the scattering amplitude depends on the momentum transfer .",
    "a full discussion and some recent references can be found in @xcite . in any case , due to a lack of both theoretical and experimental information about the phase shift , eq.([lambdach ] ) can be treated as a first approximation . in this paper",
    "the parametrization of @xmath14 used is    @xmath15    for the @xmath13 energy dependence in eq.([gsfh ] ) the gs is assumed , thus    @xmath16 ^ { \\frac 1 2 } , \\label{gsomega}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the center of mass energy for which the detail shape of @xmath13 has been originally determined .",
    "the accurate data description can be found in ref.@xcite with the `` hadronic matter '' distribution of the form    @xmath18    with the coefficients @xmath19 [ and @xmath20 in eq.([rho ] ) ] adjusted to the hadron ",
    "proton elastic scattering data at @xmath11 gev .",
    "the energy dependence of the phase shift is thus introduced by using the elastic to total cross sections ratio change [ @xmath21 function ] and by the scaling of the interaction impact parameter which reproduces the increase of cross section as the interaction energy increases [ @xmath22 .",
    "the parametrization of @xmath23 has been made in the @xmath24 form    @xmath25    which gives the cross section in mb when @xmath9 is given in gev@xmath26 .",
    "the deviation from the pomeron - type power - law fit ( see e.g. @xcite ) is negligible in the region where the fit can be compared with existing data .",
    "the advantage of using the @xmath27 form is that we do not need to concern oruselves about the violation of the froissart unitarity bound when using our formula at very high energies .",
    "using eqs.([pdens ] , [ lamb ] , and [ inel ] ) we can calculate hadron ",
    "nucleon cross sections at any energy of interest from the point of view of eas physics .",
    "the quality of proposed parametrizations is presented in figs.[elast ] and [ sigmas ] .",
    "there are two different approaches to nuclei cross section calculations .",
    "both give similar results , but foundations are quite different .",
    "broadly , it can be said that the glauber method is based on the superposition of scattering potentials , while the other method ( which we shall call hereafter the multiple scattering method ) works on probabilities .",
    "the multiple scattering approximation is widely presented in @xcite , mainly for the elastic scattering of different particles on nuclei , but the probabilistic formalism can be used to obtain cross sections of other specific processes .    of course we do not want to judge which method describes reality better .",
    "the comparison with experimental data is possible in principle , however , as will be shown , expected differences between these two approaches are comparable with other effects which has to be known with appropriate precision ( e.g. quasi - elastic scattering ) .",
    "the description given below is performed for the proton  nucleus interactions , but the extension to the nucleus ",
    "nucleus case is straightforward .      for the scattering of particle on the close many - particle system ( nucleus ) ,",
    "if each interaction is treated as a two - particle one , the overall phase shift for incoming wave is a sum of all the two - particle phase shifts .    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a set of nucleon positions in the nucleus ( @xmath30 is a position of the @xmath31th nucleon in the plane perpendicular to the interaction axis ) .",
    "( [ chiskla ] ) is the essence of the ref.@xcite and in fact defines the glauber approximation ( at least in this paper ) .",
    "the scattering amplitude is thus given by    @xmath32    where @xmath33 describes the wavefunction of the nucleus with nucleons distributed according to @xmath29 .",
    "if one neglect position correlations of the nucleons and denotes by @xmath34 each single nucleon density we have    @xmath35    if all interactions can be described by the same phase - shift function @xmath3 then    @xmath36    on the other hand , the scattering process can be treated as the single collision process with its own nuclear phase shift @xmath37    @xmath38    the comparison with eq.([st1 ] ) gives    @xmath39    where the @xmath40 means the averaging over all possible configurations of nucleons @xmath41 .",
    "to go further with the calculations of @xmath42 a commonly used assumption has to be made .",
    "if we assume that the number of scattering centers ( @xmath43 ) is large and the transparency of the nucleus as a whole remains constant then    @xmath44~. \\label{exact}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 is the distribution of scattering center ( nucleon ) positions in the nucleus ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "when the individual nucleon opacity @xmath47 is a very sharply peaked compared with @xmath45 then with the help of the optical theorem the simple formula can be found    @xmath48 \\rho_a(b)~~. % \\left [ 1 \\ : - \\ : { \\rm e } ^{- a t(b ) } \\right ] .",

    "this can be extended to the interaction with nucleus in a straightforward way .",
    "if we denote this probability by @xmath55 and nucleons in a nucleus @xmath43 are distributed according to @xmath45 then the averaged probability of inelastic interaction with one of the nucleons is    @xmath56    the inelastic cross section with the whole nucleus is then    @xmath57 ^a \\right\\}~~.\\ ] ]    in the multiple scattering picture the point - nucleon approximation can be also introduced simplifying the cross section formula . if one puts @xmath58 then    @xmath59    what leads to    @xmath60^a \\right\\ } \\label{minel}\\ ] ]    the above equation has a very similar form to eq.([ginel ] ) but the difference is also quite clear .",
    "it is interesting to note that eq.([minel ] ) is often called the `` glauber approximation '' too ( see e.g. @xcite ) .      both approaches discussed above lead to slightly different formulae for an inelastic proton ",
    "nucleus cross section . to see how big the difference is",
    "we have calculated respective cross sections using exactly the same procedures , nucleus shapes and proton  proton cross sections .",
    "it is interesting to compare results for different nucleus masses and incoming proton energies .",
    "the energy dependence in the discussed approximation is introduced only via the proton - proton cross sections change .",

    "the validity of the nucleus description used is shown in fig.[paxsect ] where the proton  nucleus inelastic cross section data measured at low energies are compared with our calculations .",
    "the interaction energy is about the same that it was used as the reference energy @xmath17 for the proton `` hadronic matter density distribution '' ( @xmath13 ) estimation , so the energy dependence of all proton  proton cross section parameters are not involved here .",
    "the comparison between the simplified glauber [ eq.([ginel ] ) ] and multiple scattering [ eq.([minel ] ) ] results is given in fig .",
    "[ xsecc1 ] for proton  nucleus as well as for nucleus  nucleus interactions .",
    "we have chosen here the `` air nucleus '' as a target and five different projectiles which represent main components of primary cosmic ray mass spectrum .",
    "the difference is not very significant .",
    "the energy dependence is similar and the systematic shift is rather constant as maight be expected . it should be remembered that for light nuclei ( especially for protons ) eq.([ginel ] ) looses its physical basis .",
    "the important point of this paper is to show how the point - nucleon approximation changes the results .",
    "both formulae given in eqs.([minel ] ) and ( [ ginel ] ) are in fact in agreement with the factorization hypothesis for individual nucleon ",
    "nucleon @xmath3 function [ eq.([gsfh ] ) ] , according to which nucleons get blacker as the interaction energy increases .",
    "our analysis , presented in section 2 , strongly favoured the geometrical scaling which treats nucleons as getting bigger .",
    "nucleus profiles obtained using exact glauber formula [ eq.([exact ] ) ] differ from the @xmath64 suggested by eq.([minel ] ) [ @xmath65 in eq.([ginel ] ) ] .",
    "the difference can be seen in fig.[ddis ] .",
    "a significant change of the nucleus size have to influence the value of inelastic cross section .",
    "fig.[finxsec ] shows the change in inelastic cross section of proton  nucleus with the interaction energy calculated using geometrically scaled and factorized nucleus profiles .",
    "as can be seen , the difference at very high energies is remarkable .",
    "results presented in the previous section indicate the importance of re - examination of the proton  proton cross section estimation based on proton  air data measured in eas experiment .",
    "the conversion from proton  air to proton  proton cross section presented in fig.[pppair ] is obtained using the exact glauber formalism .    the original fly s eye estimation of proton  proton total cross section given in @xcite is 120 mb , yet according to results given in fig.[pppair ] it is 109 mb .",
    "the same procedure was applied to the akeno data and all their proton  proton cross sections also appear to be about 10% overestimated .",
    "high - energy points plotted in fig.[sigmas](a ) which are often reproduced in the literature are taken from the original works .",
    "they agree quite well with the two phenomenological descriptions plotted there .",
    "the approximation of the cross section rise used in this paper [ eq.([inel ] ) ] agrees with the block and cahn and with the durand and pi parametrizations in the low - energy region , but falls below the original eas proton ",
    "proton data points .    in fig.[pair ] the calculated proton  air cross section energy dependence is given .",
    "the full curve represents result obtained using the exact glauber formula [ eq.([chiopt ] ) ] and proton  proton phase shift @xmath3 function described in section 2 [ with the proton  proton cross section rise defined by eq.([inel])and shown in fig.[sigmas ] by the full curve ] .",
    "the outcome of the `` simplified glauber '' approach [ eq.([chig ] ) ] is given for a comparison by the broken curve .",
    "as can be seen , the proposed cross section rise gives very good agreement with eas measurements at about @xmath66 gev .",
    "comparison of our results with outcomes from some of the most popular shower development codes ( see e.g. @xcite with different models used there ) shows that energy dependence of nucleus  air cross sections used there are rather flat , which perhaps suggests that a `` simplified glauber '' have been used in cross section calculations ( see the dotted curve in fig.[finxsec ] ) .",
    "the relatively correct , fast , rise of the sibyll @xcite model proton ",
    "air cross section is obtained with `` simplified glauber '' formalism , but with a quite extraordinary rise of the total proton  proton cross section at high energies ( reaching about 150 mb at @xmath67 gev ) .",
    "we have shown that the geometrical scaling hypothesis with the exact glauber formalism gives the value of proton  proton total cross section at about 30 tev slightly ( 10% ) smaller than that reported in original fly s eye and akeno papers .",
    "the fit for @xmath68 given in eq.([inel ] ) leads to @xmath69 shown in fig.[sigmas](a ) by the full curve and correctly reproduces @xmath70 cross section measured by eas experiments as it is shown in fig.[pair ] .",
    "the rise of the @xmath71 predicted by the geometrical scaling hypothesis with the exact glauber formalism is significantly faster than that which can be obtained using simplified formulas ( fig.[finxsec ] ) .",
    "this can change the physical conclusions based on monte carlo simulations of the eas development at very high energies .",
