    "intensive studies of majorana fermion physics in solid state materials were motivated by possible applications of these states in topological quantum computation @xcite . in condensed matter , initially , majorana fermions were predicted to exist in spinless @xmath2-wave superconductors ( sc ) and fractional qhe @xcite .",
    "later , the realizations of majorana bound states ( mbs ) @xcite and 1d charge - neutral modes @xcite were proposed in hybrid structures where helical electronic system has a proximity effect with external @xmath3-wave pairing potential and zeeman exchange field .",
    "the helical systems with spin and momentum locking are realized in surfaces and edges of topological insulators ( ti ) , quantum spin - hall films @xcite and semiconductors with strong spin - orbital coupling@xcite .",
    "the transport signatures of mbs are associated with anomalous @xmath4-periodic josephson effect @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "charge - neutral chiral majorana modes ( @xmath5 mm ) which are , for instance , supported by sc - magnet junctions on 3d ti surface @xcite , are expected to show unconventional interferometry if involved in charge transfer between normal metal leads .",
    "various @xmath5mm - based devices operating as mach - zehnder @xcite , fabry - p ' erot @xcite , and hanbury - brown twiss @xcite quantum interferometers have been proposed . in context of quantum computation",
    "they can serve as a readout tool of qubit states encoded by mbs in vortex cores @xcite .    in the paper",
    "we calculate dc josephson current - phase relation ( c@xmath6r ) of a long spinless contact between 1d gapless @xmath5mms .",
    "the system under consideration represents a chiral fabry - p ' erot interferometer implemented on a surface of 3d ti partially gapped by sc and magnetic ( m ) islands .",
    "similar ideas were explored in refs . .",
    "in these works normal dissipative transport of dirac fermions influenced by their splitting to majorana modes and the interference of the latter were studied .",
    "in contrast , we study the equilibrium phenomenon of josephson current carried by the andreev states formed in the chiral dirac liquid .",
    "the latter connects between two superconducting leads , which are effectively gapless due to chiral majorana modes at their edges .",
    "spinless structure of the junction follows from the absence of spin degeneracy of 2d helical surface states .",
    "presence of zeeman field breaks time - reversal symmetry and produces gapless chiral channels at the magnetic domain boundaries . in our system",
    "the normal conducting region consists of two separated chiral dirac channels supported by magnetic domain walls .",
    "we explore two models of ( i ) transparent and ( ii ) tunnel junctions .",
    "the first one involves four chiral y - junctions , operating as direct charged - to - neutral fermion converters .",
    "the second one has two tunnel contacts formed by thin layers of magnetic material where majorana and normal dirac channels are hybridized .",
    "the length of the n - region , formed by two counter propagating 1d dirac modes , is assumed to be larger than coherence length of the induced superconductivity .",
    "in other words , the thouless energy of the normal conducting part of the system under consideration is significantly smaller than the proximity gap .",
    "we take into account a contribution to the transport from sub - gap 1d chiral states only , neglecting 2d bands .",
    "since our superconducting leads are gapless due to the presence of @xmath5mms , the spectral current is continuous and consists of smeared andreev levels .",
    "assuming that superconducting leads are large and have a fixed chemical potential , we obtain the conventional @xmath7-periodicity of the c@xmath6r . in other words",
    "the non - equilibrium @xmath4-periodic josephson effect ( which is predicted  @xcite for systems with zero - energy mbss ) turns out to be irrelevant here .",
    "the chiral structure of the normal part consisting of two 1d spinless dirac modes allows to make andreev pairs non - local .",
    "this means that the pair resides on two separated dirac channels and one can apply magnetic flux @xmath8 inducing aharonov - bohm phase @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "it follows that the critical current has a fractional @xmath11-periodicity rather than the conventional @xmath12 one .",
    "the realization of the normal region by two separated chiral channels in the present setup is one of the most relevant distinctions from the junctions with 2d topological insulator where andreev pairs exist on the same edge @xcite .",

    "next we calculate josephson c@xmath6r at arbitrary temperature and flux enclosed by dirac modes . the section [ mm - i - n - i - mm ] addresses the tunnelling regime , in which majorana and dirac modes meet at the tunnel contacts formed by magnetic constrictions . in section [ majorana - basis ]",

    "more specifically , the spin textures of the guiding channels of majorana and dirac modes are orthogonal to the momentum direction in the particular case of rashba type hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) . as a consequence the spin textures are antiparallel in the counterpropagating channels .",
    "more generally , any scattering at a junction will be accompanied by the corresponding spin rotation .",

    "we analyze in detail the regime @xmath171 ( keeping @xmath71 as a free parameter ) , since it corresponds to the case of the transparent junction ( [ cphr - hbt ] ) up to geometry dependent @xmath71 and the berry phases .",
    "the majorana basis is defined through the following transformation for both the left and the right contacts @xmath207 where the index @xmath208 here stands for @xmath209 and @xmath210 channels . the @xmath146-matrix ( [ s - matr ] ) under this transformation at arbitrary @xmath149 reads @xmath211 according to ( [ m - basis - tunn ] ) @xmath204 mode is always fully decoupled , consistent with the scattering theory of li , fleury and bttiker @xcite . in the weak tunneling limit @xmath168 the modes @xmath5 and @xmath206 scatter into each other with the amplitude @xmath154 . in the opposite unitary limit @xmath173",

    "the presence of the scattering phase @xmath71 in the scattering matrix ( [ s - matr - hbt ] ) of the transparent dirac - majorana contacts changes the situations considerably .",
    "we apply again the transformation ( [ basis-0 ] ) to @xmath89-operators and obtain the following @xmath13-matrix in the majorana basis ( setting @xmath214 ) @xmath215 this matrix coincides with that of ( [ m - basis - tunn ] ) in the limit @xmath216 only if @xmath217 . for the other values of @xmath218 all the modes are mixing with each other . at arbitrary @xmath71",

    "to conclude , we analyzed two limits of 1d long ballistic josephson junctions where the leads are formed by gapless 1d chiral majorana channels.these junctions can be realized as hybrid structures involving 3d topological insulator surface in proximity with s - wave superconducting electrodes and magnetic materials .",
    "the normal region of these setups is formed by two chiral dirac modes spaced by a magnetic material .",
    "such a normal part is effectively spinless because the spin textures are locked to profiles of magnetic domain walls .",
    "in the first part of the work we have calculated the c@xmath6r in the regime of high transparency . in this limit the left and the right contacts of the junction consist each of two dirac - majorana converters built by magnet / superconductor interfaces .",
    "we find that this system has a continuous spectral current , a @xmath7-periodic non - sinusoidal c@xmath6r at low temperatures and an @xmath0-periodic dependence of the critical current on the magnetic flux .",
    "the critical current amplitude at zero temperature is given by thouless energy which is proportional to inverse dwell time of the normal region .",
    "the junction can act as a squid because the two dirac channels are spatially separated .",
    "an andreev pair in this case appears to be spatially non - local , which offers a possibility of inducing an internal aharonov - bohm phase .",
    "this leads to one of our central results : the critical current shows fractional @xmath0-periodic pattern .",
    "in the second part of the work we have studied another realization of the junction where dirac and majorana channels are coupled through a tunnel barrier .",
    "the c@xmath6r of such a tunnel junction was found in terms of the tunneling hamiltonian approach and corresponding scattering matrix .",
    "the resulting critical current patterns show sharper resonant peaks as compared to those for the transparent junction . we have also studied the formal extension of the tunneling solution to the high transparency regime and compared it with the one obtained in the first part of the work .",
    "interferometers involving chiral majorana modes @xcite could find their applications as measuring devices of topological qubits  @xcite . in this paper we have explored a dual setup , in which the equilibrium josephson current is carried by interfering chiral dirac electrons between chiral majorana leads .",
    "embedded into schemes with vortices and/or magnetic or sc islands supporting zero - energy majorana pairs , a josephson based quantum interferometer might be of advantage , e.g. , for performing quantum readout of topological qubits .",

    "the local form of tunneling hamiltonians ( [ h - contact ] ) is an approximation , because , microscopically , such contacts are formed by constrictions of finite size as depicted in figure [ contact ] .",
    "if the constriction is wide and the hybridization is negligible , the parallel chiral channels along sc/+m and + m/@xmath37 m junctions have opposite ( orthogonal ) spin textures . in the tunneling area , shown as the constriction of the magnetic material in the black bar , the eigenfunctions can be approximated by superpositions of the eigenfunctions of the isolated dirac and majorana channels , @xmath224 and @xmath64 .",
    "this means that an electron coming into the tunneling area starts to oscillate between hole- and majorana - like states with a rate , proportional to a hybridization of the channels , estimated as @xmath225 , where @xmath226 is a transversal constriction length . finally , the incoming electron scatters into a superposition of outgoing electron , hole and neutral excitation in the majorana channel . from this qualitative picture",
    "one can conclude that the scattering matrix should be periodic with respect to the phase of these oscillations , given as a product of hybridization energy and the constriction dwell time @xmath227 .    here",
    ", we derive this periodic behavior of the @xmath146-matrix from the local tunneling hamiltonian ( [ h - contact ] ) .",
    "we employ the heisenberg equations of motion @xmath228 where the tunnel matrix is given by @xmath229 we write @xmath230 in these equations in order to make the chirality of the majorana mode the same as that of the charged channel . in this representation we can consider incoming and outgoing states as those at @xmath231 and at @xmath232 respectively .",
    "it follows from the @xmath32-integration of ( [ eq2dagger],[t - matr ] ) around the point of contact @xmath233 that the relation between the tunneling matrix @xmath234- and the scattering matrix @xmath146 reads @xmath235.\\label{s - t - exp}\\ ] ] calculating the exponent we obtain @xmath236 where the dimensionless tunneling strength @xmath237 is given by @xmath150 this tunneling @xmath146-matrix is unitary and obeys the particle - hole symmetry @xmath238 like @xmath13 .",

    "the solution method leading to ( [ s - matr - app ] ) and ( [ s - t - t ] ) is not universally accepted .",
    "rather , a different ansatz was used in various problems on transport in 1d systems such as tunneling between edge states of qhe @xcite , impurity scattering in luttinger liquid at @xmath240 @xcite or resonant andreev reflection from zero - mode majorana bound state @xcite . following these works",
    "we should have taken the local @xmath89- and @xmath5-operators at point @xmath144 as @xmath241 relations ( [ psi - chi-1/2 ] ) produce then the same solution for the scattering matrix as in ( [ s - matr - app ] ) . however , the parameter @xmath149 is now different and is given by @xmath242 the two solutions coincide in the weak coupling limit @xmath167 . for larger values of @xmath148",
    "the difference is substantial .",
    "for instance , the unitary limit @xmath243 is achieved with ( [ psi - chi-1/2 ] ) and ( [ eq : lambdatilde ] ) at @xmath244 .",
    "in contrast , with ( [ s - t - exp ] ) it is reached at @xmath245 .",
    "we conjecture that the solution method , leading to ( [ s - t - exp ] ) applies if the constriction is smooth enough , so that the validity of the low energy description provided by ( [ h ] ) and ( [ h - contact ] ) is not violated in any point of the constriction .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eq2dagger ] ) is solved as a regular differential equation . on the other hand ,",
    "the ansatz ( [ psi - chi-1/2 ] ) is probably applicable for sharp enough constrictions .",
    "this ambiguity should be resolved by solving 2d bdg equations for the constriction geometry .",
    "in this appendix we present technical details of the calculation of the josephson current .",
    "we find the c@xmath6r as the difference between the chiral currents in @xmath138 and @xmath139 arms by using the tunnel junction scattering matrix @xmath146 , given by ( [ s - matr - app ] ) .",
    "we take the 1-st and the 3-d lines of ( [ s - matr - app ] ) , disregarding the outgoing majorana field @xmath220 ( line 2 ) , and obtain @xmath246 the matrix in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ m - norm - andr ] ) contains amplitudes of normal and andreev reflection , while the last term describes coupling with the equilibrium majorana @xmath209-channel .",
    "this term is responsible for the spectral current ( [ sp_current ] ) being continuous , due to the gapless spectrum of the incoming lead majorana mode .      using ( [ s-0 ] ) we formulate the boundary conditions for the left and right contacts .",
    "we introduce the field @xmath250_{x}^t$ ] , which depends on @xmath40 and on the coordinate @xmath32 along the dirac channels .",
    "indices @xmath138 and @xmath139 stand for the upper and lower dirac modes ( see figure [ setup ] ) .",
    "we start from the left contact where @xmath251 and @xmath252 . using ( [ s-0 ] ) and its hermitian conjugate at @xmath253 as well as the property of the real majorana field , @xmath254 , we derive @xmath255 here @xmath256 is the @xmath257 identity matrix in the left upper block and @xmath258^t$ ] .",
    "note , that for the left contact @xmath139-components of @xmath259 are @xmath209-fields while @xmath138-components are @xmath210-fields : @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "the rank of the 4@xmath2624 matrix in ( [ bc_left ] ) equals @xmath263 and the eigenvalues are equal to @xmath264 regardless of the values of @xmath149 and @xmath6 .",
    "the condition for the right contact is obtained from ( [ bc_left ] ) by the replacements @xmath265 the pauli matrix @xmath266 , introduced in ( [ bc_right ] ) , mixes the @xmath257 blocks in ( [ bc_left ] ) acting as a particle - hole transformation , while @xmath267 acts inside of the blocks . the product @xmath268 interchanges @xmath138 and @xmath139 indices in @xmath269 .",
