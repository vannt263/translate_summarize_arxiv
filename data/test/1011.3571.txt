    "first , an innovator adopts a novel idea or practice , then people in contact with the innovator adopt it , then people in contact with those people , and so on . in this way , information cascades on a social network .",
    "not surprisingly , information cascades are also common in online social networks .",
    "they are created , for example , when an individual forwards an email she receives to her contacts  @xcite , or retweets a news item to her followers on twitter  @xcite .",
    "understanding how information spreads in online social networks may be indicative of its quality  @xcite . a mathematical tool for analysis of cascades can find extensive use anywhere where",
    "cascades are studied : anomaly and spam detection , information classification , viral marketing , epidemiological studies , computer virus spread , political and social unrest and even power transmission failure  @xcite .",
    "availability of large scale data about human behavior in online social networks has enabled computational scientists to investigate what drives information diffusion and suggest mechanisms to facilitate its spread . however , as in any other field of research , there are two distinct ways of tackling this problem : model - centric or empirical .",

    "we need principled mathematical tools to quantitatively characterize the temporal and spatial properties of cascades as they occur in real - world networks . however , to the best of our knowledge",

    ", we propose a _ practical , general , and scalable quantitative framework _ for the analysis of cascades on social networks that is applicable even to large cascades .",

    "as the size of cascades grows , storing their complete structure may not be feasible . however , the cascade generating function can approximate the structure of the cascade with very high accuracy , in spite of having pseudo - linear space complexity .",
    "hence , the cascade generating function can provide _ efficient compression _ of the information in a cascade .",
    "this paper makes the following contributions . in section  [ sec : framework ] we describe a general mathematical framework for representing and quantitatively analyzing cascades on social networks .",
    "specifically , in section  [ sec : characterization ] , we define the cascade generating function , which describes how information spreads through the network . we show that this function can be used to compute cascades macroscopic properties , such as its size , diameter , number of paths in the cascade , etc . in section  [ sec : comp ] , we present a fast , efficient algorithm to compute this function , having @xmath0 runtime complexity and @xmath1 space complexity in its naive implementation , where @xmath2 is the number of nodes participating in a cascade , @xmath3 is the maximum degree of any node and @xmath4 is the number of independent cascade seeds .",

    "visualization , however , quickly becomes difficult , even for moderately - sized cascades .",

    "we do not observe the _ community effect _ either in the initial or later stages of this contagion process .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath25 for this story is two and the average path length is 2.6 , indicating that most of the voters are the fans of the submitter or submitter s fans , but are not themselves interconnected .    in summary , cascade plots can tell us much about the microscopic evolution of information cascade .",

    "the trends of the dominant cascades grow increasingly similar with time due to the mixing effect of `` colliding cascades .",
    "'' however stories that do not become popular generate very few cascades and have low spread . when submitter is well connected , the community effect is visible in all stages of the contagion process , implying that the story spreads within submitter s community only . however , when submitter is poorly connected , cascades grow by chaining and branching .",
    "most of the earlier work does not clearly distinguish between cascades and the contagion processes generating these cascades .",
    "we believe that ours is the first work studying large scale cascades without link ambiguity .",
    "though large scale studies of information cascades have been carried out earlier @xcite , the cascades in general were small in size ( o(10 ) ) .",
    "we on the other hand , have very large cascades ( extending up to @xmath176 ) . the quantitative framework for analyzing cascades that we present here",
    "is very scalable and can be easily used to provide a efficient compressed representation of large cascades , when storing the complete information of the entire cascade is no longer trivial . in previous studies",
    "@xcite , the authors characterize the cascades / contagion processes using a multilevel approach comprising of global and local signatures .",
    "cascades are considered to be approximately isomorphic if they have the same global signature .",
    "if the global signatures match , more expensive isomorphism tests based on local signatures are carried out . to aid reasoning about cascades ,",
    "the authors focus on _ local cascades _ , which they define as the ` cascade in the ( undirected ) _ neighborhood _ of the node ' , which for every node is the subgraph induced on the nodes reachable from it .",
    "they enumerate the shapes of these local cascades .",
    "as cascades grow in size , the number of possible shapes increases exponentially and such enumeration becomes infeasible .",
    "note that in this work we provide a scalable , efficient and compressed representation of the observed cascades and make no claims about whether the observed cascades are the actual cascades or fragments of them .    in our study of digg",
    ", we have cascades of size up to @xmath177 .",
    "we aim to deduce their qualitative as well as quantitative properties , such as shape and size .",
    "hence a more formal framework for characterizing cascades is required . in this paper",
    "we provide such a formalism , which not only captures the macro and micro level signatures described above , but much more .",
    "for instance , it captures the similarity between cascades , which were initially similar but later become dissimilar ; or , similarity between cascades that are similar in some stage of their growth .",
    "this formalism enables us to distinguish between cascades and obviates the need for enumerating them or drawing their shape .    in @xcite , the underlying network on which information spreads is not observed , but has to be inferred from the observed cascades .",
    "however such inferences @xcite are based on the hypothesis that the contagion process follows an independent cascade model  @xcite .",
    "our work , on the other hand , focuses on providing a quantitative tool to analyze the trends and patterns of actual contagion processes observed on real - life networks . even when the underlying network is predicted using a different inference methods , e.g. ,  @xcite , the trends of the contagion process occurring on the network can be investigated using the cascade generating function .",
    "future work includes using these tools to aid the verification or rejection of the hypothesis used for modeling information spread  @xcite .",
    "it can also prove to be an effective tool to evaluate the robustness of inferred networks  @xcite .    as demonstrated by the third story in our examples",
    ", we observe that if the submitter is well connected , the community effect is visible at all stages .",
    "however , initial popularity only within the tightly knit community ( shown by a high cascade value and few seeds in the initial stages ) does not ensure global popularity ( large number of votes ) .",
    "in contrast , stories submitted by a not so well connected user , which spreads by branching and deepening initially ( with low cascade values ) , but have larger number of initial active seeds become more popular globally ( as shown by the second story in the example ) .",
    "this observation is in agreement to those reported in @xcite that content diffusing primarily through an interconnected community tends to be confined to that community .",
    "these cascades are also complicated by the interplay between social influence and homophily  @xcite .",
    "future work will address these questions more closely .",
    "in previous works  @xcite , the cascade size was found to be described well by the power - law distribution .",
    "however , we observe that power - law only accounts for a small fraction of cascades at the tail of the distribution .",
    "rather , the entire data can be approximated well with a stretched - exponential ( weibull ) , lognormal or double pareto lognormal distributions , similar to those observed in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we adopt an empirical approach to study cascades on networks .",
    "we believe that our work is first to provide a mathematical framework to quantify and analyze cascades , even for applications requiring real - time or online analysis .",
    "the mathematical framework is based on the cascade generating function , which quantitatively characterizes both the micro and the macroscopic properties of the cascade .",
    "the macroscopic properties that can be efficiently calculated using this tool include the diameter and the spread of the cascades .",
    "this function also provides an efficient compression of the information encoded in cascades . in spite of having pseudo - linear space complexity",
    ", it can be used to reconstruct the shape of the cascade with high degree of accuracy .",
    "although large scale studies of cascades have been carried out , the size of cascades in these studies was relatively small . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first study of very large cascades with thousands of participants .",
    "we use this function to study information cascades on an online - social news aggregator digg . for macroscopic properties like number of cascades in a contagion process , cascade size , spread , diameter , average length and so on ,",
    "we observe a stretched exponential ( weibull ) or a lognormal distribution fits well with the observed distribution .",
    "double pareto lognormal distribution gives a very good fit for the distribution of number of cascades .",
    "usually power law accounts ( if at all ) for a small percentage of data in the tail of the distribution .",
    "microscopic analysis also revealed interesting insight to cascades and contagion processes , such as the possible effect of the initial number of seeds and of the branching , chaining and community effect on the initial popularity of news .",
