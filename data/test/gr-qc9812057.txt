    "regge calculus @xcite is used to re - examine a particular class of brill wave spacetimes @xcite investigated by miyama @xcite , and more recently , holz @xcite and alcubierre @xcite . in particular , we study the formation of apparent horizons within the simplicial initial data , and confirm recent findings regarding the appearance of such horizons @xcite .",
    "brill wave initial data was first constructed using regge calculus by dubal @xcite , although we show elsewhere @xcite that his procedure is unable to capture the full structure of complex axisymmetric initial data sets . by using an improved lattice ( which is described in full in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we are able to accurately reproduce the continuum solution , and find apparent horizons in excellent agreement with recent two and three - dimensional calculations @xcite",
    ".    we proceed as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly survey the approach taken by brill @xcite in the construction of gravitational wave initial data . in section",
    "[ sec : regge ] we describe the axisymmetric lattice used to construct brill waves using regge calculus . in section",
    "[ sec : trapped ] we describe the method used to find apparent horizons at a moment of time symmetry , and in section [ sec : horizons ] we investigate the appearance of apparent horizons in the brill wave space as the wave amplitude is increased .",
    ".mass estimates for the regge ( @xmath0 ) and continuum solutions ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the mass is calculated from the decay of @xmath2 in the asymptotic region .",
    "we also show the results of previous calculations by holz @xcite and alcubierre @xcite , which are in excellent agreement .",
    "all our results were calculated on a @xmath3 grid . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    using the technique outlined in section [ sec : trapped ] , we now search for apparent horizons in the brill wave initial data constructed in sections [ sec : continuum ] and [ sec : regge ] .",
    "we find that in both the regge and continuum solutions an apparent horizon first appears at a critical amplitude @xmath4 , which lies in the range @xmath5 $ ] . as the amplitude @xmath6",
    "is increased above this critical value , two trapped surfaces are present , and these gradually separate .",
    "these results are in complete agreement with the recent calculations of alcubierre @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : horizons]_a _ shows a projection of the trapped surfaces found for a wave amplitude of @xmath7 , calculated using both the continuum and regge solutions .",
    "there is a slight difference between the surfaces calculated using these two independent sets of initial data , but the discrepancy is found to reduce as the second power of the grid spacing . in figure",
    "[ fig : horizons]_b _ , we show the position @xmath8 of both trapped surfaces along the @xmath9-axis as a function of the brill wave amplitude .",
    "the quadratic fit to this data allows us to improve the estimate of the critical wave amplitude at which an apparent horizon first forms .",
    "we estimate that @xmath10 for the simplicial solution , and @xmath11 for the solution to the continuum equation .",
    "both solutions predict that the single horizon at @xmath12 passes through @xmath13 .",
    "the value of the critical amplitude @xmath4 , at which an apparent horizon first forms , differs from that obtained in an earlier calculation by some of us @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy in the earlier work was due to the relatively weak convergence criteria used for the trapped surface finder .",
    "qualitatively , the previous work agrees with both the present calculations and those of alcubierre @xcite .",
    "we have used regge calculus to confirm recent numerical findings regarding the formation of apparent horizons in a particular class of brill wave spacetimes , while demonstrating that regge calculus provides an alternative and competitive technique for use in numerical relativity .",
    "brill wave spacetimes provide a challenging test - bed for the future development of simplicial gravity .",
    "work is currently underway on the development of a simplicial trapped surface finder for regge calculus , as well as the time evolution of the initial data constructed here , in both @xmath14 and @xmath15-dimensions .",
