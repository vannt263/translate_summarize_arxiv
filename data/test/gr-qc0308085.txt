    "the lisa mission is a collaboration between esa and nasa to build and operate a space - based laser interferometer aimed at detecting and studying gravitational waves ( gw ) of astrophysical origin .",
    "the current schedule places the launch around the year 2011 , and the 3 - 10 years observation period is expected to produce a number of observations of galactic binaries @xcite , of massive black hole mergers and captures , and possibly of a cosmological stochastic background @xcite .",
    "early studies of the data analysis techniques that will be required to observe these signals are important since they couple our present knowledge about the sources lisa will be able to observe to the science requirements guiding the design of the lisa mission itself .",
    "it is in this context that we present here a study of the accuracy that can be expected for the characterization of the noise in the lisa detector once it has been placed in its heliocentric orbit .",
    "this is needed not only for being able to assess the lisa sensitivity in a region of the frequency band where the stochastic signal from coalescing galactic binaries would prevent it , but most importantly for being able to detect weak gravitational wave signals with confidence .",
    "theoretical modeling and pre - launch performance measurements of flight - unit instruments will certainly be performed .",
    "however these might not be sufficient to achieve the level of accuracy required in the analysis of the data collected during the inflight operation of lisa .",
    "specifically , we calculate in the low frequency regime the optimal approximations for the spectra of the noise affecting the interferometric combinations sensitive to gravitational waves , by relying _ only _ on all the possible cross - spectra between the interferometric combinations that are sensitive to gravitational radiation and the symmetrized - sagnac combination , @xmath0 . the rational behind this is that @xmath0 couples very weakly to gravitational radiation while it is affected by the same instrumental noises as the other combinations @xcite .",
    "these approximations give a lower bound on the error that can be achieved by estimators which make no prior assumptions about the characteristics of the various noise sources .",
    "such estimator could be used for carrying out the full analysis , or for validating the noise models one could adopt for implementing more sophisticated and efficient data analysis techniques .",
    "an outline of the paper is given here .",
    "section [ lbdan ] presents a review of the lisa baseline design , which is then followed by a discussion of the noise characterization problem in section [ ifnc ] . in section [ mia ]",
    "we show that closure for the solution to the noise characterization problem does not exist , and that only approximate solutions can be implemented . in section [ nm ]",
    "we describe the noise model used in our calculations , which accounts for possible cross - correlations between pairs of various noise sources .",
    "although these terms have been neglected in the literature , they could contribute to the overall noise budget of the mission , and for this reason they are included in our analysis .",
    "we then present in section [ ebotep ] our calculation of the lower bound on the estimated noise spectra in the lisa interferometric combinations that are sensitive to gravitational radiation . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we finally provide our comments on the implications of these bounds for the astrophysical reach of the lisa mission , and on possible implementations of noise estimation algorithms that would approach the error bounds we estimate .",
    "the lisa mission will consist of three spacecraft flying in an approximately equilateral triangle formation .",
    "the length of the arm opposite to spacecraft @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is labeled @xmath3 .",
    "the three nominal arm lengths will be equal to @xmath4 s ( @xmath5 ) , and they will differ from each other by at most a few percents during the entire duration of the mission . in contexts",
    "where the differences between the length of the arms can be disregarded , we will simply refer to the nominal arm length @xmath6 , without indices .",
    "as it is illustrated in figure [ fig : opticalbenches ] , each spacecraft will contain two optical benches .",
    "each bench will be designed to bounce a laser beam between each of its proof mass and another proof mass on a distant spacecraft .",
    "the proof masses are mechanically isolated from their optical bench , and their relative position is measured with electrostatic sensors .",
    "these generate inputs for the drag - free control systems that allow the spacecraft to isolate the proof masses from external disturbances in such a way to maintain them ( to a very good approximation ) in a free - falling configuration in the directions to the other two spacecraft .",
    "in addition , laser beams will be bounced off the back of the proof masses and will be exchanged between the optical benches on a given spacecraft in order to sense the motion of the optical benches relative to the proof masses .     and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 denote normal vectors along the triangle arms , and @xmath9 denotes the random velocity vector of proof mass 1.,title=\"fig:\",height=288 ]    with this baseline design of the lisa spacecraft , the frequency noise of the lasers will dominate the secondary noise sources ( such as acceleration noise of the proof masses or optical path length distortions ) by approximately seven orders of magnitude in the frequency band of interest ( @xmath10 hz ) .",
    "time delay interferometry ( tdi ) has been proposed @xcite as a robust way for suppressing the frequency fluctuations from the lasers and the mechanical vibrations of the optical benches to levels smaller than that identified by the secondary noise sources .",
    "this is done by properly time - shifting and linearly combining the measurements of the phase differences between the coherent laser beams exchanged between the three pairs of spacecraft and the three pairs of on - board optical benches @xcite . in reference @xcite it has been shown that the entire space of the tdi combinations can be generated by four combinations , called @xmath11 and @xmath0 , which are the sagnac interferometric combinations lisa will be able to synthesize . since ( @xmath12 ) can be regarded as a basis for the entire space of the lisa tdi combinations , in what follows we will limit our analysis to these four interferometric data .    it should be noted that the modifications of the sagnac observable ( @xmath12 ) required in order to account for the rotation of the lisa array @xcite and variation in time of its arm lengths @xcite can be disregarded in the analysis presented here . although it will be critical to account for these effects in order to suppress the laser phase fluctuations below the secondary noise sources , the modifications introduced to the gravitational wave and secondary noise responses entering into the tdi combinations @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath0 ( derived under the assumption of a stationary lisa configuration ) will be negligibly small .",
    "it is anticipated that the dominant noises affecting all the tdi combinations will be introduced by the proof masses and optical path noises ( shot noise and beam pointing fluctuations ) . in the notation of fig .",

    "( [ eq : matchedmany ] ) maximizes the probability of detecting the signal for a fixed value of the false alarm probability .",

    ", one will use the estimator in eq.([eq : optestimator ] ) , with some estimated value of @xmath55 that contains an error , as in eq.([eq : pertc ] ) .",
    "this estimator will necessarily have larger errors than the cramr - rao bound . because the second term of the right - hand side of eq.([eq : optestimator ] ) is linear in @xmath79",
    ", @xmath80 will be unbiased , independently of the size of the error @xmath62 .",
    "it is shown in appendix [ sladipa ] that the error term in the covariance of the estimator constructed with the perturbed correlation matrix will vanish to first order in the perturbation @xmath62 , so that , like the snr , the variance of the estimated quantities will be at most second order in the measurement errors of the correlation matrix .    at high frequencies ( @xmath81 mhz , @xcite ) ,",
    "the gravitational wave sources are expected to be discrete in time or in frequency , so that it should be possible to identify portions of the time series that are free of signal , and can therefore be used to estimate the spectra with an excellent accuracy ( which is limited only by the integration time , and indirectly by the stationarity of the noise ) . at lower frequencies , on the other hand , gravitational waves from the galactic binaries will not be distinguishable , and will form a stochastic signal above the instrumental noise .",
    "strong signals that are above this confusion limit might be detected and analyzed with respect to the noise from the binaries , which can be estimated with high accuracy by integrating the data for a long enough time .",
    "the most direct application of the characterization of the noise at low frequencies is thus the measurement of the stochastic background itself . in other words , it is highly desirable to have techniques that can effectively `` turn off '' the gravitational signal , in order to properly characterize the instrumental noise . at higher frequencies",
    ", these techniques should not be crucial for the detection of weak signals , but should be very useful in understanding and validating the detector performance . to give a specific example",
    ", it might be useful at some point to verify that a given spectral line is of astrophysical origin and is not instrumental , without having to rely on astrophysical assumptions ( such as the doppler modulation of the signal ) .    in the simplest search , a stochastic background will be detected by comparing the measured spectra @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 to the estimate of the instrumental noise .",
    "differences between the measured and the estimated spectra will be interpreted as a stochastic background .",
    "it therefore goes without saying that the low frequency portion of the instrumental noise spectra in those tdi combinations must be estimated as well as possible .    as it has been recognized in @xcite , the tdi combination @xmath0 ( i.e. , the fully symmetric sagnac combination )",
    "is much less sensitive to gravitational waves than the other sagnac combinations ( @xmath11 ) in the low part of the frequency band accessible to lisa ( @xmath85 mhz ) , although it is affected by the same instrumental noise sources .",
    "consequently , it can be used as a `` gravitational waves shield '' to estimate the instrumental noise .",
    "this approach was introduced by @xcite to bound the power in the stochastic background .",
    "since the gw signal is additive in the noise of the tdi combinations , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the measured spectrum of the unequal - arm michelson combination @xmath88 , @xmath89 is the spectrum of the instrumental noise in @xmath88 , and @xmath90 is the spectrum of a stochastic background . it is shown in @xcite that the following inequality holds @xmath91 where the _ upper bound _ on the instrumental noise spectrum is , in the low - frequency region of the lisa band , @xmath92 with @xmath93 being a lower bound on the spectrum of the acceleration noise of all proof masses , and @xmath94 a lower bound on the spectrum of the optical noise of all optical paths .",
    "a somewhat similar approach is used in @xcite to estimate the _ average _ of three tdi combinations , @xmath95 .",
    "they estimate @xmath96 by multiplying @xmath97 by a judiciously chosen transfer function , and subtract the result from the measured @xmath98 to get @xmath99 .",
    "this `` averaged '' estimator is quite different from what we will consider below , and will not be discussed further .",
    "at low frequencies , the real function @xmath97 and the three complex functions @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , give seven measurements that are insensitive to gravitational waves , in the sense that @xmath103 , @xmath104 . since the four tdi generators fulfill the following identity @xmath105 \\tilde{\\zeta } = \\left[e^{i \\omega l_1 } - e^{i \\omega(l_2 + l_3)}\\right ] \\tilde{\\alpha } + \\nonumber \\\\ \\left[e^{i \\omega l_2 } - e^{i \\omega(l_1 + l_3)}\\right ] \\tilde{\\beta } + \\nonumber \\\\ \\left[e^{i \\omega l_3 } - e^{i \\omega(l_1 + l_2)}\\right ] \\tilde{\\gamma } , \\label{identity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the seven functions introduced above are not all independent .",
    "in particular , we could try to estimate @xmath106 by a linear combination of the cross - spectra @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath97 as @xmath107 using the identity eq.([identity ] ) to expand the right - hand side of eq.([eq : saa ] ) and collecting terms in @xmath108 gives @xmath109a + [ 1-\\cos \\omega(l_1-l_2-l_3)]z = 1 - \\cos \\omega(l_1+l_2+l_3 ) .",
    "\\label{eq : eqn1}\\ ] ] further requiring all the other terms in the right - hand side of eq.([eq : saa ] ) to be zero gives eight other equations .",
    "however , the only solution satisfying those eight equations is @xmath110 \\sin \\frac{\\omega}{2}(l_1-l_2+l_3)}{\\sin \\frac{\\omega}{2}(l_1+l_2+l_3 ) } \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and this solution does not satisfy eq.([eq : eqn1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath106 can not be reconstructed from measurements of spectra that are insensitive to gravitational waves .",
    "the argument can be extended to other spectra with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to consider combinations of the insensitive spectra that are only approximations to the spectra involving @xmath41 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "in what follows we first define a realistic noise model for lisa .",
    "the best combination of the spectra and cross - spectra involving @xmath0 for this model will be derived in the next section , where it will be used to set a bound on the accuracy that can be achieved in characterizing the lisa noise spectra    the principal source of noise at low frequencies is the acceleration noise of the proof masses along their sensitive axes .",
    "a number of effects lead to acceleration noises which sum up to a noise budget ( per proof mass ) of @xmath111 m s@xmath112 hz@xmath113 at 0.1 mhz @xcite .",
    "the principal sources of acceleration noise might be due to @xcite : thermal distortion of the spacecraft , cross - talk between the other degrees of freedom and the sensitive axis , gravity gradient noise due to spacecraft displacements , fluctuating spacecraft magnetic fields , thermal noise , back - action from sensing , electric forces from fluctuating charge , residual gas , magnetic damping , temperature variations , etc .",
    "it should be noted that the first four noise sources might affect _ both _ proof masses on a given spacecraft , so that the acceleration noises of the two masses will be correlated to some extent .",
    "this might be important for the correct estimation of the noise level that will be achievable with tdi @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will assume that the acceleration noises , converted in terms of relative frequency fluctuations , are given by @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 , @xmath116 is kronecker s delta , and @xmath117 is an arbitrary complex number with norm @xmath118 .",
    "the correlated noises should couple to the proof masses either gravitationally or magnetically , so the phase angle of @xmath117 will only depend on the spatial distribution of the perturbing field with respect to the sensitive axes of the two proof masses .    at frequencies above @xmath119 mhz ,",
    "the optical path noises dominate the total sensing noise . the optical path noise budget @xcite includes contribution from the shot noise affecting the phase measurement at the photodiodes , as well as phase fluctuations resulting from scattered light effects , laser beam pointing instabilities , and path length variations on the benches and within the telescopes .",
    "the latter two effects will couple the optical path noise along various paths : pointing instabilities will correlate the noise along the paths related to benches @xmath1 and @xmath120 , while the path length variations will mostly introduce correlations at times offset by the one - way - light - time @xmath6 between the measurements from beams going in opposite direction along a given arm . in",
    "what follow we will make the assumption that the latter effect is dominating the cross - correlation of the optical path noise , and write the following expressions for the optical path noise spectra and cross - spectra @xmath121 where @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 is a positive real number .",
    "the cosine term in eq.([eq : conoise ] ) comes from the time delay @xmath6 for the propagation of phase noise along one of the lisa arms .    in what follows",
    "we will use two noise models . in the first case we will be optimistic and assume all cross - correlation terms to be negligible , i.e. we will pick @xmath127 . in the second , pessimistic case , significant correlations will be assumed to be present .",
    "for the acceleration noise , we take @xmath128 , corresponding to the fact that roughly 50% of the noise budget ( in strain ) corresponds to noise sources that can induce strong correlations between the two proof masses on - board one spacecraft . since there is no specific reason for preferring a particular value of the phase for @xmath117 over any other , we will treat it as a free parameter in our analysis .",
    "we will also pick @xmath129 , based on the fact that roughly 15% of the optical - path noise budget ( in strain ) is attributed to path length variations on the optical benches and the telescopes .",
    "it should obviously be noted that these noise models will probably not give a realistic description of the noise that will affect the lisa measurements .",
    "they are only chosen to provide some guidance in the noise characterization problem .",
    "in this section we calculate the smallest possible errors between the estimated and real instrumental spectra that can be achieved by using only the gw - free measurements @xmath130 , where @xmath131 .",
    "these spectra are the only ones that are free of laser frequency noise and of gw signals , and therefore form a natural basis for building noise estimators that do not rely on unverifiable assumptions about the properties of the noise sources .",
    "our error bounds will obviously depend on the noise model used , and so will the estimators that achieve these bounds that we will present .",
    "these estimators will therefore not be valid estimators for the characterization of the lisa noise ; model independent estimators that approach our error bounds will be presented in a follow - up communication .",
    "each tdi combination will show a different transfer function for the noise contributions identified in the previous section .",
    "in particular , every spectrum will be a linear combination of the acceleration and optical noise spectra , so that any instrumental noise spectrum @xmath132 ( @xmath133 are any tdi combinations ) can be written as @xmath134 where @xmath135 is a complex vector of frequency dependent coefficients , and @xmath136 is the real vector of the @xmath137 noise spectra @xmath138 the @xmath130 spectra only have terms of the form @xmath139 , or @xmath140 .",
    "this is because @xmath0 has the same transfer function to @xmath141 and to @xmath142 , so any spectrum @xmath130 will only have terms of the form @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "consequently , only three of the four quantities @xmath145 and @xmath140 can be measured simultaneously .",
    "a similar argument applies for the optical noises . in that case , a @xmath130 spectrum measures the combinations @xmath146 and @xmath147 , so one can only measure @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 simultaneously .",
    "inequalities in the lengths of the arms may break these symmetries .",
    "the coefficient vector @xmath151 is known from the definition of the tdi combinations , and it just consists of geometrical transfer functions .",
    "clearly , there is not enough information to measure every one of the 21 terms in @xmath136 .",
    "this means that an approximated solution has to be used .",
    "supposing we want to measure the instrumental spectrum @xmath132 , we can measure @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath97 , and then approximate @xmath135 with the following expression @xmath152 the estimated spectrum @xmath153 is then given by @xmath154 performing the approximation in eq.([eq : tapprox ] ) requires the definition of a proper error metric . in this paper",
    ", we choose a model dependent metric in order to bound the achievable error on the estimated spectrum .",

    "if , however , the error on @xmath55 is frequency dependent over the frequency range where the signal contributes significantly to the snr , the filter used to construct @xmath211 will be far from optimal , and significant degradation in the snr will occur .",
    "supposing for simplicity that the signal contributes uniformly to the snr over a bandwidth @xmath212 , and supposing that the error on the correlation matrix is @xmath213 over a bandwidth @xmath181 included in the signal frequency range , then @xmath214.\\ ] ] the snr losses will be the smallest when the error on @xmath55 is uniform over most of the bandwidth of the signal , as it is the case for narrow - band signals , and obviously when these errors are small where the signal is large compared to the instrumental noise .",

    "the inverse of the perturbed fisher matrix given in eq.([eq : fisherc ] ) is given by @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the achievable covariance when the correlation matrix is known exactly ( @xmath206 ) .",
    "using this and the first order expansion of the inverse of the correlation matrix into eq.([eq : optestimator ] ) gives four terms that are first order in @xmath62 .",
    "these four terms can be simplified using the following identities @xmath219 { \\rm re}\\left[\\frac{\\partial\\tilde{{\\bm{\\chi}}}}{\\partial{\\bm{\\lambda } } } { \\bm{c}}^{-1 } ( \\tilde{{\\bm{x } } } - \\tilde{{\\bm{\\chi}}})^\\dagger \\right]^t \\right ] { \\bm{i}}_0^{-1 } \\\\",
