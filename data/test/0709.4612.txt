    "fluctuations in many natural and artificial phenomena are found to exhibit fractal characteristics . in applications ,",
    "this has been characterized by the so - called singularity spectrum of some numerical or experimental data . to understand the dynamics underlying the fractal , it is not uncommon that multiple data capturing different aspects of the phenomenon of interest are used in the analysis .",
    "for example , velocity and temperature flucutations are used to analyze the momentum and energy aspects of the multifractal hydrodynamic turbulence [ 1 ] , blood pressure and heart rate fluctuations to analyze the cardiovascular aspect of the @xmath1-like power spectrum of the heart rate variability in humans [ 2 ] , packet size and arrival time to analyze the congestion and connectivity aspects of the multifractal network traffic [ 3 ] , and so on . for fractal analysis on natural objects ,",
    "multiple data cross examination may provide the chance to examine the potential link of fractal fluctuation in the data .",
    "in particular , one would suspect some degree of _ fractal correlation _ in the data if the fractal generating mechanisms associated with the data source are coupled together .",
    "essential to the notion of fractal correlation is the distinguishability of singularity spectra .",
    "there are fundamental and practical issues related to this subject .",
    "for example , consider a standard @xmath2-adic multinomial process on an interval .",
    "it is a multiplicative cascade constructed by repeatedly dividing the interval into equal @xmath2 segments and assigning ( probability ) weights @xmath3 , from one generation to the next . continuing this procedure _",
    "ad infinitum _ leads to a limiting process with no density ( almost surely ) and intermittent spiking pattern .",
    "its singularity spectrum @xmath4 may be estimated by the legendre transform of @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "now , consider a different @xmath8-adic cascade ( @xmath9 ) generated by weights @xmath10 , and its singularity spectrum @xmath11 . if @xmath12 , one must have @xmath13 however , no @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be found to satisfy this equation for all @xmath16 .",
    "thus , singularity spectra can in theory be distinguished , at least for the important class of multinomial processes . for more in - depth",
    "treatments and examples , see the excellent book by pesin [ 4 ] .    in practice ,",
    "a different issue can arise .",
    "that is , two singularity spectra may be close to each other within the limit of finite precision .",
    "consider again the cascades from above .",
    "let @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( so @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "then , @xmath21 will agree at four important @xmath16 values : @xmath22 . with",
    "the rest of @xmath23 and @xmath24 chosen properly , they can be made almost indistinguishable ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this problem was addressed by l@xmath25vy - l@xmath25hel and vojak who developed a much sharper mutual multifractal analysis to relate the singularity spectra to the generation of multinomial processes [ 5 ] .",
    "riedi and scheuring arrived at the similar relative multifractal analyses with further details on the numerical implementation [ 6 ] ; see also [ 7 , 8 ] . for experimental data , meneveau et al .",
    "introduced a joint partition function analysis ( jpfa ) based on the 1d version introduced by hentschel and procaccia [ 9 ] and halsey et al .",
    "[ 10 ] . with essentially the same procedure of estimating the singularity spectrum , these authors characterized fractal correlation in the small scale kinetic energy transfer , heat concentration and vorticity of the turbulent flow [ 1 ] .",
    "they implied that multiple cascades of more than one variables are responsible for the fractal fluctuation in fluid turbulence ; see also [ 11 ] .",
    "the jpfa has also been applied in diversed areas such as precision agriculture [ 12 ] , soil property [ 13 ] , and re - emerged in the general discussion of discrete scale invariance of the multinomial process [ 14 ] .    in these past studies ,",
    "jpfa as well as most singularity analyses were conducted on the assumption of one - dimensional multifractal measures and solved using the classical box counting procedure .",
    "such applications can be limited in scope when , typically in the experimental study , the data is a fractal function that is not additive . for functions created by the integral of multinomial measure under @xmath26 perturbation [ 15 ] , bacry et al . proved that the singularity analysis developed for fractal measures is equally applicable by using the so - called wavelet transform modulus maxima ( wtmm ) method .",
    "later , the validity of wtmm was examined by jaffard for any function [ 16 ] .",
    "regarding wtmm , it was proved that ( i ) it can yield the upper bound estimate of the singularity spectrum for any function and ( ii ) it is exact for the so - called self - similar fractal function , as long as the so - called maxima lines are not too close to each others .",
    "the purpose of this study is to introduce a joint wtmm method to carry out the jpfa of fractal correlation .",
    "the wtmm - based approach can provide an accessible and stable tool for estimating fractal fluctuation in multiple experimental data .",
    "we also point out that jpfa is a more general formulation .",
    "in particular , the existing relative multifractal analysis developed for the similar purpose relates to jpfa at a particular parameter setting . while the term correlation is normally linked to the second order statistics , fractal correlation as estimated from the singularity spectra",
    "is a property of moment of all orders .",
    "indeed , the primary object of the analysis is the hausdorff dimension @xmath27 of the support of observing exponents @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it will be shown that the set @xmath27 describes a two - dimensional surface whose level sets characterize the coupling of fractal generating mechanisms as well as the relative multifractal spectrum studied in the past .",
    "our results are organized into four sections . in the next section",
    ", the background of wtmm is first summarized .",
    "the extension to the wtmm - based jpfa and its connection to the relative multifractal spectrum are then given .",
    "the test of the method using multinomial cascades are presented in section 3 .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section 4 .",
    "singularity analysis is built on the notion of continuity of functions . recall that a function @xmath30 is continuous of exponent @xmath31 if there are @xmath32 , such that , for @xmath33 , @xmath34 in the neighborhood of @xmath35 , there exists a supremum @xmath36 that ( 1 ) is valid for all @xmath37 .",
    "the exponent @xmath38 is the exponent of @xmath30 at @xmath39 .",
    "formally [ 15 , 16 ] , one can find an @xmath40th order polynomial @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that @xmath43 it is evident that the exponent characterizes the differentiability of the function and , thus , how the function can fluctuate .",
    "for example , @xmath44 for @xmath26 functions , @xmath45 for functions that are only @xmath40 times differentiable and @xmath46 for functions that are non - differentiable .",
    "the @xmath46 case draws the most attention since it means the function can fluctuate in large amplitude over short time intervals and gives rise to the so - called intermittent pattern witnessed in many physical systems . in this case , the exponent @xmath47 is also known as the singularity exponent .",
    "the natural tool to analyze the singularity property is by the wavelet transform : @xmath48(t , a ) = { 1\\over a}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\psi\\left({t'-t\\over a}\\right ) x(t')dt ' \\eqno(2)\\ ] ] where @xmath49(t , a)$ ] is the wavelet coefficient and @xmath50 is the analyzing wavelet .",
    "muzy et al .",
    "showed that the exponent @xmath47 can be estimated effectively using the supremum of @xmath51|$ ] along the so - called maxima line formed by the local wavelet modulus maxima [ 18 ] .",
    "denote the set of maxima lines at scale @xmath52 by @xmath53 .",
    "bacry et al .",
    "proved that [ 15 ] @xmath54 where @xmath55(t , a)|$ ] is the supremum of the modulus maxima along the maxima line @xmath56 . for functions created by the integral of multinomial measures under @xmath26 perturbations",
    ", it was shown that the legendre transform of @xmath57 yields the hausdorff dimension of the support @xmath58 , @xmath59 ; @xmath60 see also [ 16 ] . in the literature ,",
    "@xmath61 is sometimes referred to as the partition function due to its analogy to the energy partition function in statistical mechanics .",
    "a monofractal refers to the case where @xmath62 is a singleton .",
    "the singularity spectrum is called multifractal when @xmath63 spans an interval .      in this section ,",
    "the wtmm approach is generalized and applied in the jpfa of fractal correlation between multifractal singularity spectra .",
    "we present the application of jpfa of two data sets .",
    "the extention to more data sets is conceptually similar .",
    "consider @xmath64 and their respective sets of singularity exponent @xmath65 .",
    "let the maxima lines of @xmath66|$ ] at scale @xmath52 be denoted as @xmath67 .",
    "a natural extension of the existing wtmm analysis is to consider a joint partition function of the form : @xmath68 where @xmath69 are the modulus maxima along the maxima lines @xmath70 .    to realize ( 5 ) , the maxima lines in @xmath71 must be paired up properly ( so the index @xmath72 can run ) . as in most correlation analyses ,",
    "the goal is to characterize the property related to observing both singularity exponents @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in terms of the wtmm analysis",
    ", such information is contained in the modulus of the neighboring maxima lines .",
    "if the time coordinate of @xmath73 is denoted by @xmath74 , this means the coefficients @xmath75 , @xmath76 paired up in ( 5 ) can be determined by @xmath77    once ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are established , similar procedure developed by bacry et al .",
    "can be extended to characterize the geometry associated with the observation of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , based on @xmath78 , @xmath79 [ 15,17,18 ] , ( 5 ) can be given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath27 are the probability density function and hausdorff dimension of the support of @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "applying the standard argument of steepest descent in small @xmath52 , one has @xmath83 where @xmath84 hence , @xmath85 and @xmath27 are legendre transform pair : @xmath86 @xmath87 where @xmath88 finally , from ( 9 )  @xmath89  ( 11 ) , the correlation coefficient between @xmath90 can be estimated using @xmath85 : @xmath91}}\\biggr|_{q_1=q_2=0 } \\eqno(12)\\ ] ] where cov denotes the covariance and @xmath92 denotes the standard deviation of @xmath93 .",
    "this expression will be used in the next section to compare with the numerical result .    in practice ,",
    "the legendre transform ( 10 ) relies on using @xmath94 estimated from ( 8) .",
    "however , there are known factors , such as lacunarity [ 19 , 20 ] , that introduce oscillatory , scale dependent , prefactor .",
    "this results in the poor estimate of @xmath85 .",
    "a remedy to this problem can be motivated by an alternative approach equivalent to the canonical ensemble in statistical mechanics [ 20 ] .",
    "let @xmath95 then , it can be shown ( appendix ) : @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98      relative multifractal analysis and similar ideas were developed to characterize fractal correlation between fractal measures .",
    "the main idea is to replace the use of lebesgue measure in the traditional fractal analysis [ 5,6,7,8 ] . specifically , consider the partition functions of multifractal measures @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xmath101 where @xmath102 denote generic partitions of the support and @xmath103 denote the lebesgue measure of the set . to examine the extent to which the singularity of @xmath99 correlate with @xmath100 , the sets which scale as a power law",
    "will now be characterized by using @xmath99 .",
    "for example , the partition function of @xmath99 is now written as @xmath104 where the ",
    "big @xmath105 \" describes the order relationship @xmath106 as @xmath107 .",
    "define @xmath108 for which ( 18 ) holds .",
    "the relative multifractal spectrum is obtained via the legendre transform of @xmath109 .",
    "it characterizes the support of the singular behaviour of the form @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "the relative multifractal analysis can draw a much sharper distinction between @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "for example , @xmath112 is nonlinear when @xmath113 and @xmath114 when @xmath115 ; see [ 6 ] for more details .",
    "comparison of ( 18 ) with ( 5 ) and ( 8) suggests @xmath109 can be obtained as the level set of @xmath116 where @xmath117 to assure finite generalized dimension , @xmath118 and , thus , the level set @xmath116 must pass through @xmath119 .",
    "this property can also be directly seen for the multinomial processes ( next section ) .",
    "similarly , by switching the role of @xmath120 , the singular behaviour of @xmath100  viewed \" by @xmath99 can be described . with the same argument ,",
    "this is characterized by @xmath121 defined from the same level set @xmath116 where @xmath122 .",
    "it may be useful to point out that @xmath123 on the @xmath124 plane are nothing but mirror images of the contour of @xmath116 about @xmath125 and @xmath126 axes , respectively .",
    "in general , @xmath127 , although they are derived from the same level set .",
    "to test if the wtmm - based jpfa can reliably characterize fractal correlation , numerical experiments are conducted on the coupled random binomial cascades studied by meneveau et al .",
    "the first cascade , denoted as @xmath99 , is generated by weights @xmath128 ( referred to as @xmath99-cascade ) .",
    "let @xmath129 denote an interval segment generated in the @xmath130th iteration where @xmath131 and @xmath132 is the based-2 coarse - grained representation of any @xmath133 . by the multiplicative rule , @xmath134 .",
    "the second cascade , denoted as @xmath100 , is generated by weights @xmath135 ( referred to as the @xmath100-cascade ) . with the same addressing scheme , one has @xmath136 where @xmath137 .    in the numerical experiment , a parameter @xmath138 and a uniform random variable @xmath139 in [ 0,1 ]",
    "are used to control the degree of coupling or correlation between the cascades .",
    "let @xmath140 , @xmath141 be the new segments created from their parent segment of the previous generation . if @xmath142 , the weights assigned to @xmath143 of the @xmath100-cascade will depend on exactly how the weights of the @xmath99-cascade are assigned .",
    "the rule for this dependence is that @xmath144 and @xmath145 ( @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) are always assigned at the same time .",
    "for example , if @xmath144 is assigned to @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) of the @xmath99-cascade , @xmath145 will be assigned to @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) of the @xmath100-cascade and similarly for @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "if @xmath148 , the weight assignment for the cascades will be completely independent from each other . this way , the fractal generating mechanisms of the cascades are completely dependent of each other when @xmath149 and independent of each other when @xmath150 .    the coarse - grained joint partition function for the coupled cascades can be defined based on ( 5 ) : @xmath151 from the combination of @xmath139 completely dependent and @xmath152 independent proportions , @xmath153 is derived explicitly as @xmath154 where @xmath155 as @xmath156 , @xmath157 and the analytical @xmath85 can be obtained from ( 21 ) as @xmath158 by ( 10 ) , the analytical @xmath90 and @xmath27 can be found [ 21 ] .",
    "these results will be compared to the numerical ones below .    in the numerical experiments , @xmath159 and @xmath160",

    "the modulus maxima and the maxima lines of the individual cascade are first obtained .",
