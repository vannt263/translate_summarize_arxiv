    "secco ( * ? ? ?",
    "* b15a , hereafter ) is a survey aimed at searching for stellar counterparts of ultra compact high velocity clouds ( uchvc ) of neutral hydrogen that have been recently proposed by different teams as candidate mini - halos residing in the local group or its surroundings ( @xmath6  mpc ; * ? ? ?",

    "* alfalfa and galfa - hi surveys , respectively ) .",
    "the only way to confirm the nature of uchvcs as small gas - rich dwarf galaxies is to identify a concomitant stellar population that can allow to constrain the distance to the system .",

    "] of the cloud , @xmath7  km / s ( a13 ) , hence physically associated to it .",
    "as detailed in b15b , having considered several different hypotheses , we concluded that the newly discovered stellar system , that we baptised secco  1 , is ( most probably ) a star - forming and extremely gas - rich ( @xmath8 ) dwarf galaxy located in the virgo cluster of galaxies . in particular",
    ", secco  1 likely resides within the substructure named low velocity cloud ( lvc ) whose members span the range of radial velocity @xmath9  km / s@xmath10  km / s @xcite . the coarse metallicity estimate we obtained in b15b was suggestive of a system much more metal - rich than the typical dwarf of similar luminosity .",
    "@xcite confirmed our conclusions with independent data but did not provide an independent estimate of the metallicity . on the other hand they identified a second small group of blue stars @xmath11 northeast of the main body of secco  1 , suggesting that the two systems are associated . in the following",
    "we will refer to the original stellar system found by b15a as the main body ( mb ) of secco  1 , and to the new group as its secondary body ( sb ) .",
    "in b16 we showed that sb is indeed recognisable in our original secco images and that some additional blue sources possibly associated with secco  1 can be identified also to the east of the main body .",
    "moreover , by comparison with very low - surface - brightness dwarfs also residing in virgo , identified in the same images as secco  1 , we were able to constrain any population older than @xmath12  gyr within secco  1 to have surface brightness significantly fainter than @xmath13  mag / arcsec@xmath14 .",
    "finally , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* a15 , hereafter ) presented new hi observations that resolved the original hvc274.68 + 74.0 cloud ( that was seen as an individual entity of size @xmath15 at the @xmath16 resolution of the alfalfa survey ) into a @xmath17 main cloud nearly centred on mb ( agc  226067 ) , likely connected by a thin bridge to a smaller cloud ( @xmath18 , agc  229490 ) located @xmath19 to the west of sb .",
    "a15 concluded that ( a ) with the revised estimates of the mass of the gas clouds the gas - to - stellar - luminosity(mass ) ratio becomes less extreme than that derived by b15b and s15 , and more similar to the galaxies studied by @xcite , and ( b ) that secco  1 mb ( agc  226067 ) , sb ( which they call agc 229491 ) and the nearby cloudlet agc  229490 are two or three low - mass galaxies within the virgo cluster having some kind of mutual interaction ( see a15 for a detailed discussion , and * ? ? ? * for a theoretical analysis ) .",
    "here we present the velocity field and the metallicity of several hii regions in secco  1 mb and sb obtained with the multi unit spectroscopic explorer ( muse ) at the vlt .",
    "archival images data taken with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) are used in support of our study .",
    "a thorough analysis of the full wealth of information contained in the muse and hst data is deferred to a future contribution , where we will discuss in depth the various hypotheses for the origin of secco  1 . according to mei et al .",
    "( 2007 ) the virgo cluster has a significant depth along the line of sight ( the @xmath20 range is @xmath21 mpc ) .",
    "hence it should be kept in mind that the distance of secco  1 is not so tightly constrained by its membership to virgo ; the lvc probably lies slightly behind the core of the cluster  @xcite . in the following we adopt the conventional distance d=17.0 mpc , after  @xcite and consistent with a15 .",
    "muse is a panoramic integral - field spectrograph able to acquire low resolution spectra ( @xmath22 , from the bluest to the reddest wavelength ) in the spectral range @xmath23 m  @xcite .",
    "the adopted wide field mode ( wfm ) provides a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath24 , with a pixel scale @xmath25pix .",
    "a total of 4  h of telescope time were allocated to the director s discretionary time program 295.b-5013 ( pi : beccari ) .",
    "two pointings were sufficient to sample the mb and the sb of secco  1 .",
    "for each target we acquired 6 exposures of 1000  s each .",
    "we used a simple dither pattern and applied 90 deg offset to the de - rotator between each consecutive exposure , to improve the flat fielding and to ensure an homogeneous image quality across the fov .",
    "the average seeing during the exposures was @xmath26 , corresponding to a measured full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath27  px on the final image .",
    "the raw data from each exposure were reduced and combined with the muse pipeline v1.4  @xcite run under the esoreflex environment  @xcite .",
    "the final cubes were split into 3801 single layers ( i.e. single frames ) , sampling the targets from @xmath28 to @xmath29 with a step in wavelength of @xmath30 .",
    "the modest degree of crowding in our data allowed us to extract the background subtracted flux of any source from every single layer of the cube using a standard aperture photometry routine with the task phot of iraf . a master list of objects was created by searching for individual sources with significant peaks ( @xmath31 above the background ) a ) in an image obtained collapsing few frames located around the h@xmath32 line , and also b ) in an image obtained by collapsing the entire cube into a single frame , and then merging together the two lists .",
    "this approach allowed us to recover either sources dominated by h@xmath32 emission or by the stellar continuum .",
    "the extraction of the spectra was performed using an aperture of radius=5 pix , i.e. @xmath33fwhm . a larger aperture of 10  pix was also adopted for flux calibration purposes . with this method we extracted the spectra of 68 and 45 sources in the mb and sb , respectively .",
    "further analysis revealed that only 26(12 ) of them can be reliably associated to mb(sb ) , the remaining ones being background galaxies or sources lacking spectral features allowing a reliable velocity estimate .",
    "these 26 + 12 = 38 bona - fide secco  1 sources , listed in table  [ tabvr ] , have spectra typical of hii regions and are the subject of the following analysis .",
    "it can not be excluded that some of the listed sources are not independent individual hii regions but are in fact emission peaks within larger complexes . for the purpose of the present analysis",
    "this does not seem to be a serious concern .",
    "a complementary view not based on integrated spectra of individual sources but on a pixel - by - pixel analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( magrini et al . in prep ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig_spec ] we show two illustrative examples of the 1-d spectra extracted from the muse cubes , bracketing the range of signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) where we were able to derive reliable metallicity estimates ( see sect .  [ met ] , below ) .",
    "the superb sensitivity of muse , the possibility to integrate the entire flux of each source inherent to 2-d spectrographs , and the lack of any slit - aligmnent issue ( that plagued b15b observations ) makes the quality and the s / n of the muse spectra presented here much higher than those analysed in b15b ( see their figure 2 for comparison ) .",
    "moreover the spectral range covered by muse spectra is much wider than in b15b , e.g. , including h@xmath34 , that was not reached in b15b spectra .",
    "all these factors imply a significant improvement in the precision and reliability of the new metallicity estimates for sources of similar luminosity , with respect to that analysis ( see sect .",
    "[ met ] , for further discussion ) .",
    "the left panels of fig .",
    "[ i m a ] show stamp - size h@xmath32 images of secco  1 mb and sb obtained from the muse cube .",
    "it is clear that , in addition to several individual sources ( likely hii regions ) there is also diffuse hot gas emitting in h@xmath32 . in the right panels ,",
    "we show the corresponding portions of the combined f606w ( @xmath35  s ) and f814w ( @xmath36  s ) images from the hst go-13735 program ( pi : sand ) , that we retrieved from the stsci archive .",
    "these images resolve many of the structures seen in the h@xmath32 images into individual bright and very blue compact sources .",
    "the correspondence between the sources identified in the muse image and those seen in the acs ones is excellent .",
    "we note that four sb sources are superposed on the prominent background disk galaxy at the upper margin of the image in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ i m a ] .",
    "the lines of this galaxy ( at z=0.187 ) , as well as those of the more distant smaller spiral the lower end of its disc ( at z=0.752 ) , are both seen in the spectra of these sb sources , a remarkable case of multiple chance superposition .",
    "no underlying over - density of old stars ( i.e. red giant branch stars , with age@xmath37  gyr ) associated with secco  1 is readily visible in the acs image , in agreement with the conclusions by b16 .",

    "this factor , coupled with the use of deep high - resolution acs images , allow us to obtain a new estimate of the total luminosity of secco  1 that is much more robust and reliable than previous ones ( e.g. , b15b , a15 ) .",
    "we used the aperture photometry tool ( apt , * ? ? ?",

    "the difference is due to the removal of the contribution of background sources from the luminosity budget of secco1 , which was not possible with the data available to b15a or a15 .",

    "a similar ratio is obtained considering sb and agc 229490 , but given the spatial offset between the two systems it is unclear how meaningful @xmath189 is in this specific case .",
    "the fact that all the detected sources are hii regions implies that the stellar population largely dominating the light from secco  1 has an age @xmath190  myr .",
    "there is general consensus that such a population should have a stellar @xmath191 ratio @xmath192 , with @xmath191 decreasing for younger ages .",
    "for example , the models by @xcite predict @xmath193 for a simple stellar population ( ssp ) of age=30  myr with [ z / h]=-1.35 , and @xmath194 for [ z / h]=-0.33 , assuming a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) .",

    "given the very low stellar mass , the number of hii regions found in secco  1 may appear quite large , if taken at face value ( but see sect .",

    "from the results described above we can draw several important conclusions shedding new light onto the nature of secco  1 .",
    "first of all , it is demonstrated beyond any doubt that mb , sb ( and possibly also a few additional and nearly - isolated hii regions in the surroundings ) are physically associated .",
    "the remarkable homogeneity in metallicity strongly suggest that the various pieces of secco  1 originated from a single , chemically homogeneous hi cloud that is now disrupting , probably because of its interaction with the cluster environment .",
    "this would make the system unlikely to be in dynamical equilibrium , precluding a dynamical mass estimate    second , the new observations seem to confirm , albeit with the large associated uncertainties , that the system has an extreme under - abundance of stars given its hi content , in agreement with b15b and s15 , and contrary to the conclusions of a15 .",
    "the stellar mass estimate obtained in sect .",
    "[ phot ] implies that the hi - to - stellar mass ratio is @xmath209 , placing secco  1 straight in the realm of almost - dark galaxies , as defined by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the very high mean metallicity given the stellar mass ( @xmath210 , for mb , and @xmath211 , for sb ) strongly suggests that the gas from which secco  1 stars were born was pre - enriched elsewhere , possibly torn apart by tides from the disk of a spiral galaxy during its in - fall into virgo .",
    "indeed , the location of secco  1 in a luminosity - metallicity plot is typical of tidal galaxies @xcite .",
    "the ( apparent ) lack of an old population would also be consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "the extreme sfr , given the total luminosity , may be suggestive of a star formation episode induced by some kind of interaction . as noted in b15a",
    "there are no obvious candidate parent galaxies in the immediate surroundings of secco  1 .",
    "an intriguing candidate , for the kind of system that can have produced secco  1 as a tidal galaxy is the interacting pair ngc  4299 + ngc  4294 @xcite , which show prominent hi tails , have velocity and distance compatible with membership to the lvc , and lie at the projected distance of @xmath212  kpc from secco  1 .",
    "however , an origin from this interacting system would place the detachment of secco  1 about 1.2  gyr in the past ( assuming the current radial velocity difference as a reference value ) , implying a long traveling within virgo / lvc before the occurrence of the first feeble burst of star formation , just a few tens of myr ago .",
    "this simple consideration suggests that other evolutionary paths are worth to be considered for this intriguing object , that may hint at the existence of an additional class of extremely dark stellar systems .",
    "a thorough comparative discussion of alternative hypothesis on the origin of secco  1 is clearly beyond the scope of the present contribution and is deferred to a future paper .",

    "<S> we present the results of vlt - muse integral field spectroscopy of secco  1 , a faint , star - forming stellar system recently discovered as the stellar counterpart of an ultra compact high velocity cloud ( hvc274.68 + 74.0 ) , very likely residing within a substructure of the virgo cluster of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained the radial velocity of a total of 38 individual compact sources identified as hii regions in the main and secondary body of the system , and derived the metallicity for 18 of them . </S>",
    "<S> we provide the first direct demonstration that the two stellar bodies of secco  1 are physically associated and that their velocities match the hi velocities . </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity is quite uniform over the whole system , with a dispersion lower than the uncertainty on individual metallicity estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the mean abundance , @xmath0 , is much higher than the typical values for local dwarf galaxies of similar stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that the secco  1 stars were born from a pre - enriched gas cloud , possibly stripped from a larger galaxy . using archival hst images we derive a total stellar mass of @xmath1 for secco  1 , confirming that it has a very high hi to stellar mass ratio for a dwarf galaxy , m@xmath2/m@xmath3 . the star formation rate , derived from the h@xmath4 flux is a factor of more than @xmath5 higher than in typical dwarf galaxies of similar luminosity .    </S>",
