    "a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) is a state of matter in which a large number of bosons occupy the same quantum mechanical ground state . as such , becs present",
    "the opportunity to study quantum systems which display large scale ( macroscopic ) collective behaviour .",
    "recently there has been much interest in multi - component becs because of their importance to quantum optics @xcite .",
    "multi - component becs are most often formed in a multi - well potential in which the components are spatially separated @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the multi - component formalism can be used to model a single component bec that possesses several internal degrees of freedom , such as varying amounts of spin @xcite .    in general , many - body systems are of significant importance in physics . for example , quantum information processes require the manipulation and control of systems with large numbers of particles .",
    "however , many - body systems are often difficult to treat exactly and are most often studied using numerical or approximate methods .",
    "the realm of applicability of these methods is limited by the number of degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "two common approximate models are the bose - hubbard model of quantum optics @xcite and closely related to it , the lipkin - meshkov - glick model of nuclear physics @xcite , both used to describe the two - body interactions of spin-@xmath8 systems .",
    "a family of exactly solvable many - body systems was introduced in @xcite and studied in greater depth in @xcite .",
    "these models can be used to describe the physics of a two component bec where both elastic and mode - exchange inelastic collisions are present .",
    "mode - exchange collisions are known as general nearest neighbor interactions in the context of multi - well becs @xcite and as inelastic collisions in the case of a single condensate consisting of particles in two hyperfine levels @xcite .",
    "the family of models is parameterized by a positive integer @xmath9 , and hence the specific models are called @xmath9-models .",
    "this terminology is used because the @xmath9-model contains @xmath10body interactions .",
    "analytic solutions can be found for the @xmath9-model when the strengths of the various particle interactions obey specific constraints . while the @xmath9-models are of interest to many - body physics in general , in this paper we will largely be concerned with the @xmath11-model where only single body interactions and two - body collisions are considered .",
    "microscopic calculations show that mode - exchange collisions occur in becs as a result of the interaction of a laser field with the system @xcite .",
    "the 2-model includes the usual josephson - type interactions , but also allows the effects of mode - exchange collisions to be studied analytically , and as such provides a more realistic framework for studying two - mode becs than the canonical josephson hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the analytic solution found in @xcite requires that the strengths of the various interactions meet certain constraints ; if these constraints are not met the solution is invalid .",
    "while in some experimental situations the rates of inelastic and elastic mode - exchange collisions can be controlled externally @xcite , this is not always the case .",
    "moreover , even in if the rate of collisions can be manipulated , the constraints will likely still only be approximately satisfied .",
    "it is thus of interest to extend the solution space of the system to the case in which these constraints are only approximately satisfied .",
    "this naturally leads to the consideration of small parameter perturbations in the model to study its robustness . along with perturbations within the model it is of interest to include additional interaction terms as perturbations , such as inelastic collisions resulting in particle loss .",
    "particle loss , often suppressed in experimental settings , is studied theoretically by considering classical rate equations @xcite .",
    "more recently , a quantum treatment of 3-body loss has been given in @xcite .",
    "including external perturbations extends the predictive power of the model",
    ". additional interactions of primary interest include three - body recombination , background collisions , spin exchange and dipole relaxation @xcite . to our knowledge , this is the first study which analyzes particle loss as a perturbative effect in becs .    motivated by the above considerations , in this paper we carry out a full perturbative analysis of the solvable bec 2-model proposed in @xcite .",
    "we begin by reviewing this model and the solutions derived when the constraint equations on the parameters are satisfied @xcite .",
    "we then introduce perturbations to the parameters in the model and analyze the effects on the particle distribution , entanglement and the evolution of the relative number operator . in later sections we discuss the effects of state degeneracy and the inclusion of a general loss term as a perturbation , illustrating the formalism by studying background collisions and three - body recombination .",
    "the @xmath11-model studied in @xcite is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the hermitian conjugate of the preceding term .",
    "the two modes @xmath14 and @xmath15 are independent bose operators satisfying @xmath16=1=[b , b^{\\dagger}]$ ] with the commutators of all remaining pairs vanishing .",
    "the term @xmath17 is the free energy of @xmath18 particles in the @xmath14 mode and @xmath19 particles in the @xmath15 mode , with frequency difference @xmath20 between modes .",
    "this frequency difference arises because the model describes atoms in different hyperfine levels , or alternatively unsymmetric spatially separated condensates @xcite .",
    "a josephson - type or spin flip interaction is included with strength @xmath21 and phase @xmath22 . in practice",
    "such an interaction is induced by an external field , such as a laser @xcite .",
    "this interaction may also be interpreted as modeling the tunneling of particles between modes with probability proportional to @xmath21 . also included",
    "are terms corresponding to number - preserving elastic and mode - exchange collisions , namely those terms containing four bose operators .",
    "the interaction with strength @xmath23 is a single dispersive process .",
    "the interaction with strength @xmath24 describes a collision where two particles exchange their mode .",
    "the elastic interaction has strength @xmath25 and models the collision of a particle from each mode in which the number of particles in each mode is conserved .",
    "we see that the mode - exchange collisions preserve the total particle number but not the relative particle number .    the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ becham ] ) can be efficaciously studied by first introducing the simpler hamiltonian @xcite @xmath26 with real constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "such a hamiltonian models a two - mode condensate with energy difference @xmath27 between modes and elastic scattering probability proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "as is clear from the form of @xmath29 the relative number operator @xmath30 is a commuting observable so that the number of particles in each mode is conserved . in particular",
    ", there is no probability of spin - flip or tunneling between modes .",
    "we also note that the total number operator @xmath31 commutes with @xmath29 .",

    ", so that a choice of @xmath67 determines @xmath27 .",
    "]    it is important to recall that , in the case of a double - well bec , the two - mode approximation must be satisfied @xcite .",
    "this means that collisions taking place in the region where the wavefunctions overlap must be less probable than collisions between particles belonging to the same well .",
    "it is possible to find an exact analytic solution to the model in this case by considering @xmath72 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that it is not possible to find analytical solutions to this model for an exactly symmetric double - well and satisfy , simultaneously , the two mode approximation .",
    "fortunately , in the case of slightly asymmetric double wells ( which corresponds to a more realistic situation ) it is possible to find exact analytical solutions in the two - mode approximation @xcite .",
    "the most general @xmath9-model hamiltonian discussed in @xcite has as its hamiltonian @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath75 are again @xmath76 with the same energy @xmath77 . the same process of matching coefficients in the expansion of @xmath78 that was used to obtain eqs .",
    "( [ coeffid ] ) can be carried out so that @xmath76 is the exact solution of a hamiltonian containing up to @xmath9-body interactions . in the general case ,",
    "there are @xmath79 free variables ( the @xmath9 @xmath80 as well as @xmath81 and @xmath22 ) in @xmath82 , whereas the number of terms in a general hamiltonian describing such interactions is @xmath83 as shown in appendix b. so while the above method continues to give analytic solutions for all @xmath9 , its range of applicability decreases as @xmath9 grows .",
    "it should also be noted that because @xmath84 contains only terms with the same number of creation and annihilation bose operators , this formalism can not be used to study interactions involving an odd number of bose operators , such as the interaction @xmath85 where one particle is lost .",
    "we remark that all of the perturbative analysis carried out below is valid not only for the @xmath11-model , but also for the more general @xmath9-models .",
    "this is so because the solutions for all @xmath9-models are @xmath86 .",
    "we need only change the interpretation of the perturbative analysis in each case .",
    "while satisfying eqs . ( [ coeffid ] ) is sufficient to obtain an analytic solution of @xmath40 , the method presented above fails to produce solutions if the parameters in @xmath40 deviate even slightly from these constraints .",
    "thus , in order to compare this model to experimental results we would like to study the solutions to @xmath40 when the constraints are only approximately satisfied .",
    "we proceed with these perturbation calculations in the section below .",
    "we begin by perturbing each of the coupling constants in @xmath40 away from the conditions given by eqs .",
    "( [ coeffid ] ) , i.e. perturbations of the form @xmath87 where @xmath20 satisfies eqs .",
    "( [ coeffid ] ) and @xmath88 is small .",
    "we omit the study of perturbations @xmath89 since this simply leads to a shift in the energy of the state by @xmath90 . in what follows ,",
    "we assume that all eigenstates are non - degenerate ; the degenerate case is discussed in section 7 . throughout the paper , given an operator @xmath91 we define @xmath92 . to perform many of the calculations that follow",
    "we have made use of a coordinate transformation between the @xmath93 basis and the @xmath94 basis , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a eigenvalue of @xmath97 and similarly for @xmath98 .      a change @xmath87 results in the perturbation @xmath99 .",
    "a calculation then shows that the non - vanishing matrix elements of @xmath100 are @xmath101 and @xmath102      a change @xmath103 results in the perturbation @xmath104 and we find that @xmath105 and @xmath106      a change @xmath107 results in the perturbation @xmath108 and we find that @xmath109    @xmath110    and @xmath111 \\left [ n(n+2 ) -(m \\pm 2)(m\\pm 4 ) \\right ] } .\\ ] ]      a change @xmath112 results in the perturbation @xmath113 and we find that @xmath114    @xmath115    and @xmath116      a change @xmath117 results in the perturbation @xmath118 and we find that @xmath119    @xmath120    and @xmath121    in each of the cases above the perturbation matrix elements simplify significantly in the limiting cases @xmath122 , in which the josephson coupling vanishes ( @xmath123 ) , and @xmath124 in which the potential well is symmetric ( @xmath125 ) .",

    "it is thus beneficial to maximize the matching of the mode - exchange collision constraints ( [ coeffid ] ) through redefinition of parameters , allowing the perturbation to have a larger effect on the @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath25 terms .",

    "this can be explained as follows . in the perturbed case",
    "the area under the particle distributions sums to unity only to first order in the perturbation .",

    "the effects on the entanglement are qualitatively different than in the non - degenerate case .",
    "in particular , the perturbations to the entanglement are mainly present only in the regions in which @xmath67 is close to @xmath254 which corresponds to a condensate with small negative scattering length .    we have also extended the formalism to include the analysis of interactions involving particle loss . from these we can predict corrections to the particle distribution , entanglement and evolution of the relative population .",
    "this provides a new class of possible experiments that will allow the model here to be tested .",
    "indeed , interactions involving particle loss have been limited experimentally , partially because they create instabilities in the system . with our results these interactions",

    "the changes induced by both three - body recombination and background collisions are qualitatively different than those induced by parameter perturbations .",
    "we find that the system is very sensitive to these external perturbations , which induce large changes in the particle distribution and entanglement from relatively small external coupling strengths , as compared to the induced changes from parameter perturbations . as with the degenerate parameter perturbation",
    ", we found that the perturbative effects on the entanglement become negligible as @xmath67 approaches @xmath32 , i.e. when the scattering length is small and positive .",
    "in general , we can conclude that higher collision rates make the condensate more stable to perturbations .",
    "our results promise to be useful in the experimental realization of two - mode bose - einstein condensates which are stable to parameter perturbations and particle loss .",
    "we are planning to extend our analysis to include many - body interactions which are present at cooler stages of the condensate and study the role of such interactions in the stability of the condensate .",

    "defining the mapping @xmath373 and extending linearly to the rest of @xmath127 then gives the desired homomorphism @xcite .",
    "a short calculation then shows that @xmath374 is mapped to @xmath375 where we have defined @xmath376 .",
    "we label the basis states in the bosonic representation as @xmath377 with @xmath32 the eigenvalue of @xmath34 and @xmath33 the eigenvalue of @xmath378 ; this is in complete analogy with the label @xmath379 .",
    "note that @xmath380 may take the @xmath381 values @xmath382 . from the definition of the homomorphism it follows that @xmath383 .",

    "similarly we have @xmath388 now rescaled , @xmath33 may take on the @xmath389 values @xmath390 .",
    "it is of interest to quantify the generality of the @xmath9-model hamiltonian under study .",
    "we begin this below by first counting the number of terms in the most general hamiltonian that would be of interest to us .",
    "to do this we must define precisely the hamiltonians that are of interest to our study of two - mode becs .",
    "first , we limit ourselves to hamiltonians that are polynomials in the bose operators .",
    "the interactions under consideration consist of any total number preserving operations .",
    "operators corresponding to such interactions must then commute with the total number operator @xmath34 . to restrict the class of interactions , we consider only those that have no intermediate interactions , such as the spontaneous creation and annihilation of a particle .",
    "this imposes the restriction that the hamiltonian be normal ordered . as usual",
    ", we also require self - adjointness of the hamiltonian .",
    "finally , we may decompose the hamiltonian into its homogeneous parts , i.e. terms of degree @xmath391 .",
    "so , it is sufficient to first consider only homogeneous hamiltonians , and then construct more general hamiltonians from these . with these assumptions",
    "we prove the following proposition .",
    "let @xmath392 be a homogeneous , self - adjoint , normal - ordered polynomial in the bose operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 and their adjoints .",
    "furthermore , assume that each term in @xmath392 commutes with the total number operator @xmath31 .",
    ". then the number of terms in @xmath392 is at most @xmath394 .",
    "let @xmath395 denote the number of terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "observe that the requirement that each term in @xmath392 commute with @xmath34 ensures that @xmath396 for some @xmath397 .",
    "consider now a monomial of @xmath392 with @xmath398 of the operators being either @xmath14 or @xmath399 while the remaining @xmath400 being either @xmath15 or @xmath315 .",
    "it is easy to check that , assuming self - adjointness , normal ordering and vanishing commutator with @xmath34 , there are @xmath401 such terms , where for @xmath402 , @xmath403 is the greatest integer less than or equal to @xmath404 .",
    "we may group the monomials of @xmath392 into three groups according to whether there are more than , less than , or the same number of @xmath14 mode terms as @xmath15 mode terms .",
    "doing so , we find that the maximal number of terms in @xmath392 is @xmath405 since @xmath406 for all @xmath407 we obtain the recursion relation @xmath408 . repeated application of this relation yields @xmath409 , which we may rewrite as @xmath410 since @xmath411 , from which the proposition follows .",
    "since we can decompose a general polynomial in terms of its monomials , the above proposition is sufficient to count the maximal number of terms in the most general hamiltonian described above .",
    "let @xmath392 be as above without the assumption of homogeneity with @xmath412 .",
    "then the number of terms in @xmath392 is at most @xmath413 .",
    "again , we can write @xmath396 for some integer @xmath414 .",
    "the number of terms in the hamiltonian is the sum of the number of terms in each of its homogeneous parts , i.e. @xmath415 . after some algebra the corollary follows .",
    "as noted in the proofs of the above proposition and corollary , the assumptions on the hamiltonian imply @xmath416 is even .",
    "we see that the total number of terms in the most general @xmath9-model hamiltonian grows like @xmath417 .",
    "we would like to compare this result to the number of terms in the @xmath9-model of @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we have not been able to successfully count the number of terms in the @xmath9-model . in order to do so",
    ", one would first need to conjugate @xmath418 by the displacement operator @xmath419 .",
    "the number of terms in this calculation grows quickly with @xmath9 which makes the conjecture of a formula for the number of terms difficult .",
    "moreover , general arguments to count the number of terms , as in the proposition above , seem difficult to make in this case .",
    "regardless , the results for @xmath420 and @xmath421 , summarized in table [ count_tab ] , suggest that there are a significant number of terms missed by the @xmath9-model . whether or not these terms are important in an experimental setting is another question .",
