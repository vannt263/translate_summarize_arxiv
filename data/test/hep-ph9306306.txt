    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions has so far explained all the available experimental data extremely well @xcite . from lep data",
    ", we can witness the agreement between theory and experiment at the level of 1% , which is a striking confirmation of the @xmath9 invariant interactions involving fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "however , some predictions of the sm have not yet been object of direct experimental observation , such as the symmetry breaking mechanism and the interaction among the gauge bosons . in particular ,",
    "the structure of the trilinear and quartic vector boson couplings is completely determined by the non - abelian gauge structure of the model , and a detailed study of these interactions can either confirm the local gauge invariance of the theory or indicate the existence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the triple and quartic gauge - boson vertices , in the scope of gauge theories , have a common origin and possess a universal strength . in the sm",
    "they are constrained by the @xmath10 gauge invariance , and for a given process , there are important cancellations between the bad high energy behaviour of the various amplitudes , which leads to a final result that is consistent with the unitarity requirements .    in a more general context , the quartic anomalous couplings can be related to the low energy limit of heavy state exchange giving rise to an effective contact interactions , whereas trilinear couplings are modified by integrating out heavy fields . therefore , it is possible to build extensions of the sm where the trilinear couplings remain equal to the sm ones , while the quartic vertices are modified .",
    "for instance , the introduction of a new heavy scalar singlet , that interacts strongly with the higgs sector of the sm , enhances the four vector - boson interaction , without affecting neither the triple vector boson coupling nor spoiling the sm predictions for the @xmath11 parameter @xcite .",
    "further examples include the higgs - less models @xcite where the breaking of the @xmath9 symmetry is realized nonlinearly , leading to the appearance of large anomalous four gauge boson vertices .",
    "one of the main goals of lep ii at cern will be the study of the reaction @xmath12 which will furnish bounds on possible anomalous @xmath13 and @xmath14 interactions @xcite . within the sm framework",
    ", it will be also possible to constrain indirectly the four - vector - boson interactions since the @xmath15 local gauge symmetry connects trilinear and quartic vertices . nevertheless , the test of a wide class of models , that predicts only quartic anomalous vector boson interactions , will have to rely on the direct measurements of reactions such as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 and @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) .",
    "this , of course , can not be done at lep ii due to its limited available center of mass energy .",
    "the planned next generation of linear @xmath0 colliders ( nlc ) will have enough center of mass energy to study directly quartic vertices through the production of three gauge boson @xcite , and will offer further independent tests of the sm .",
    "moreover , at the nlc it will be possible to transform an electron beam into a photon one through the laser backscattering mechanism @xcite .",
    "this kind of process will allow the nlc to operate in three different modes : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath20 .",
    "this versatility opens up the opportunity to perform a deeper analysis of the anomalous couplings , mainly for those new interactions involving photons .",
    "in fact , the study of the anomalous vertices @xmath21 and @xmath22 has been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite assuming the @xmath20 mode for nlc , where the sensitivity to anomalous couplings is improved by two orders of magnitude when compared to the @xmath0 mode results .",
    "it is important to point out that the laser backscattering mechanism leads to the total loss of the electron ( positron ) beam in an @xmath0 linear collider .",
    "consequently , the experimental collaborations of the nlc will have to decide in which mode they want to operate the collider , _",
    "i.e. _ either in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath20 mode , and it is essential to study comparatively the capabilities of each of these setups to explore new physics .    in this work",
    "we study the capability of an @xmath0 linear collider , operating in the @xmath1 mode , to search for anomalous four - gauge - boson interactions .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the analyses of effective lagrangians that contain at least one photon and that do not exhibit a trilinear coupling associated to it since , in this case , they can not be indirectly probed at lep ii .",
    "this search for anomalous couplings is carried out through the study of the reactions    @xmath23 \\ ; , \\label{wwe}\\ ] ]    @xmath24 \\ ; , \\label{zge}\\ ] ]    @xmath25 \\ ; , \\label{zze}\\ ] ]    @xmath26\\ ; , \\label{wgn}\\ ] ]    @xmath27\\ ; , \\label{wzn}\\ ] ]    that receive contributions from the quartic vertices @xmath21 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . some of these reactions , assuming sm couplings for all particles , were recently considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec.[coupsec ] we exhibit the chosen effective operators that gives rise to the anomalous couplings and we discuss low energy constraints coming from oblique radiative corrections .",
    "section [ lasersec ] contains a brief description and expressions for the laser backscattering mechanism as well as the discussion about the cross sections .",
    "our results for several relevant kinematical distributions of the final state particles are shown in sec .",
    "[ analsec ] , and we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ conclusec ] .",
    "in this work , we study some operators that generate anomalous quartic vector - boson vertices .",
    "we consider genuinely quartic operators , that is , operators which do not induce new trilinear vertices . with this choice",
    ", the strength of the quartic vertices can not be constrained , for instance , by lep ii bounds on the anomalous trilinear vertices .",
    "furthermore , since we are interested in probing anomalous couplings in an @xmath30 collider , we concentrate on operators that involve at least one photon .    in constructing effective operators associated to such anomalous couplings we employ the formalism of ref.@xcite .",
    "we require the existence of a custodial @xmath31 symmetry , which forbids any contribution to the @xmath11 parameter .",
    "we must also require that the phenomenological lagrangians are invariant under local @xmath32 symmetry .",
    "the lowest order operators that comply with the above requirements and give genuinely quartic couplings , involving at least one photon , are of dimension six .",
    "if we restrict our analyses to @xmath33 and @xmath34 conserving interactions , it is easy to see that there are two independent operators involving two photons @xcite @xmath35 and one operator exhibiting just one photon @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the @xmath31 triplet and @xmath38 is the electromagnetic field strength . when written in terms of the physical fields @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , the effective lagrangians ( [ lag:0],[lag : c ] ) give rise to anomalous @xmath21 and @xmath22 couplings while ( [ lag : new ] ) generates a new @xmath28 vertex .",
    "the @xmath22 vertex is particularly interesting since it is absent in the sm .",
    "it is important to analyze the possible low - energy constraints on these lagrangians due to their one - loop contribution to the vacuum polarization diagrams ( oblique corrections ) . in principle",
    ", @xmath42 contributes only to the @xmath43 two - point function at the one - loop level , and in consequence to @xmath44 , whose definition is based on the @xmath45 asymmetries . however , such contribution is proportional to the @xmath46 momentum in the loop , and consequently the loop integral vanishes .",
    "therefore there are no low - energy constraints on @xmath47 .",
    "the lagrangians @xmath48 and @xmath49 contribute to the photon , @xmath46 , and @xmath4 two point functions .",
    "due to the structure of the lagrangians , the contributions to the @xmath46 and @xmath4 self - energies are constant , _",
    "i.e. _ they do not dependent on the external momentum , and are related by the @xmath31 custodial symmetry @xmath50 where @xmath51 . therefore ,",
    "as expected , they do not contribute to the @xmath11 parameter , and also their contribution to @xmath52 vanishes .",
    "since these lagrangians preserve the local @xmath32 symmetry , the photon self - energy has the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is constant due to the explicit form of the anomalous interactions .",
    "therefore , there is no contribution to the running of the electromagnetic coupling either .",
    "however , @xmath48 and @xmath49 affect the value of @xmath55 , meaning that the @xmath56 and @xmath57 parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite or , equivalently , @xmath58 and @xmath59 in notation of ref.@xcite are modified . in order to estimate this effect ,",

    "we choose for the sake of definiteness @xmath64 . using the definitions of s and u of ref.@xcite , which for the new contributions reduce to the original definitions of ref .",

    "the one sigma result for @xmath68 is @xmath69 comparing the theoretical results ( [ teor ] ) with the experimental ones ( [ exp ] ) , we obtain , at the one sigma level , the following constraints .",
    "as we show in this paper , the bounds on @xmath71 coming from low energy data are one to two orders of magnitude ( depending on the top and higgs masses ) weaker than the accelerator limits that are obtained via the study of vector boson production in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "the most promising mechanism to generate a hard photon beam in an @xmath0 linear collider is the laser backscattering . when soft photons from a few ev laser collide with an electron or positron beam , a large flux of photons , carrying a great amount of the parent fermion energy , is generated .",
    "the spectrum of the laser backscattered photons is @xcite @xmath72 \\ ; , \\label{f : l}\\ ] ] with @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the compton cross section , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the electron mass and energy respectively , and @xmath78 is the laser photon energy .",
    "the fraction @xmath79 represents the ratio between the scattered photon and initial electron energy for the backscattered photons traveling along the initial electron direction .",
    "the maximum possible value of @xmath79 is @xmath80 with @xmath81 being the maximum scattered photon energy .",
    "it is interesting to notice that @xmath82 grows with the laser and the electron energy .",
    "however , @xmath78 should be less than @xmath83 in order to avoid that the interaction of laser photons and backscattered ones create a pair @xmath0 , which would reduce the conversion of electrons to photons . in our calculation",
    "we have chosen the laser energy in order to maximize the backscattered photon energy without spoiling the luminosity .",
    "this can be accomplished by taking @xmath84 . with this choice ,",
    "the photon spectrum exhibits a peak close to its maximum which occurs at @xmath85 .",
    "the total cross sections are obtained by folding the elementary cross sections with the photon distribution @xmath86 where @xmath87 are the cross sections , evaluated at @xmath88 , for the reactions @xmath89 , with @xmath19 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 and @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "the analytical evaluation of the cross section @xmath90 for each of the subprocesses ( [ wwe][wzn ] ) is very lengthy and tedious despite being straightforward . in order to perform these calculations in a efficient way",
    ", we used a numerical method similar to the one described in ref .",
    "we verified explicitly that our amplitudes are lorentz invariant and @xmath32 gauge invariant .",
    "the numerical integrations were performed using a monte carlo routine @xcite , and we tested our results against possible statistical fluctuations .",
    "now we have all the necessary ingredients to perform a detailed study of the production of two gauge boson in @xmath1 colliders , taking into account anomalous quartic couplings .",
    "first of all , we analyzed the effect of the anomalous couplings on the total cross section of the processes ( [ wwe][wzn ] ) .",
    "the anomalous couplings",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 contribute to the processes @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 while the coupling @xmath95 participate only of the processes @xmath91 and @xmath96 .",
    "the anomalous cross sections for these processes are quadratic functions of the parameters @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) _ i.e. _ @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the standard model cross section and @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) is the interference ( pure anomalous ) contribution .",
    "we present in table [ tot : cs ] the values of @xmath103 for the interactions [ lag:0][lag : new ] , assuming that only one anomalous coupling is different from zero at one time . for events containing a photon in the final state",
    ", we imposed a cut on the photon transverse momentum @xmath104 gev , which not only guarantees that our results are free of infrared divergences but also mimics the performance of a typical electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "as an illustration of the typical behaviour of @xmath105 , we exhibit in fig.[sig : cn ] the total cross section for the process @xmath91 as a function of @xmath63 and @xmath95 .    from the table [ tot : cs ]",
    "we learn that @xmath91 and @xmath93 are the most sensitive processes to @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in the @xmath91 case ,",
    "the sm cross section is larger than the crossed channel @xmath106 by more than one order of magnitude @xcite , due to the @xmath107-channel photon exchange diagrams @xcite that dominates in the former case .",
    "these diagrams involves the anomalous quartic coupling making this process very sensitive to @xmath62 and @xmath63 . for the process @xmath93",
    ", the sm calculation does not contain a @xmath107-channel photon exchange . however , the introduction of the anomalous couplings @xmath22 gives rise to this kind of contribution , making @xmath93 very sensitive to the anomalous couplings , despite the small value of its sm cross section . we should notice that for the process @xmath92 , the @xmath71 anomalous coupling also introduces a new contribution , due to the vertex @xmath22 , that has a @xmath4 exchange in the @xmath107-channel .",
    "nevertheless , in the effective @xmath4 approximation @xcite , we note that the enhancement is at most proportional to @xmath108 for the exchange of transverse @xmath4 s , and consequently the @xmath92 becomes almost insensitive to the anomalous couplings .",
    "the @xmath91 production turned out to be rather insensitive to the anomalous coupling @xmath95 since the anomalous vertex @xmath28 does not contribute to the dominant diagrams of this process , which are the ones involving the exchange of a photon in the @xmath107-channel .",
    "in fact , in the effective @xmath4 and @xmath5 approximations we can see that the anomalous contribution is suppressed by a factor @xmath109 in relation to the dominant terms . in spite of the cross section for @xmath96 being smaller than the one for @xmath91 , the process @xmath96 is the most sensitive to this anomalous coupling .    in order to quantify the effect of the new couplings , we define the statistical significance ( @xmath110 ) of the anomalous signal @xmath111 which can be easily evaluated using the parametrization ( [ param ] ) with the coefficients given in table [ tot : cs ] .",
    "we list in table [ tab : sig ] the values of the anomalous couplings that correspond to a @xmath8 effect for the different processes , assuming an integrated luminosity @xmath112 fb@xmath113 for the associated @xmath0 collider .",
    "we checked that our results do not change by more than a factor of @xmath114 if we adopt realistic values for the efficiency of the vector boson reconstruction and increase the value of @xmath110 to 5 .",
    "we can see from table [ tab : sig ] that the @xmath8 limits for the @xmath62 and @xmath115 couplings are approximately one order magnitude better than the limits one can get in the @xmath116 mode @xcite .",
    "our limits are of the same order than the ones obtained through the reaction @xmath117 with unpolarized beams @xcite and are within a factor of @xmath118 of the ones from the reaction @xmath119 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we must stress that the anomalous @xmath95 vertex can not be studied so well in the @xmath20 mode of the collider since it contributes only to processes like @xmath120 which have a smaller phase space . from what we learnt above",
    ", we also expect that the attainable limits at @xmath0 to be much worse than the ones from @xmath20 and @xmath1 .",
    "the study of the anomalous couplings through the total cross section of the different processes is the crudest thing that can be done . in principle , the shapes and values of the kinematical distributions can be used to increase the sensitivity to the anomalous couplings , improving consequently the bounds on the new couplings and yielding further information . in figs .",
    "[ zze : ept ] to [ zze : angm ] we compare some sm distributions for the @xmath93 process with the ones corresponding to the anomalous coupling @xmath121 , which gives a @xmath8 deviation in the total cross section . from these figures",
    ", we can see that the effect of the anomalous interactions in the distributions is more than a mere overall normalization .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ zze : ept ] exhibits the energy and transverse momentum distributions for @xmath4 and @xmath122 , and shows that the existence of an anomalous coupling favors the production of higher @xmath123 vector bosons .",
    "more dramatic is the difference in the angular ( or rapidity ) distribution of the final particles , as seen in fig.[zze : cosy ] . in the sm",
    ", the final electron goes preferentially in the opposite direction of the initial electron , as in a `` compton - like '' process .",
    "however , the anomalous @xmath124 coupling contributes with a new photon @xmath107-channel , which is dominated by low transfer momenta .",
    "this effect makes the electron go mainly in the forward direction and leads to an electron angular distribution which is very distinct from the one expected in the sm .",
    "the distributions in the angle between the final particles and the invariant - mass distribution of the @xmath125 pair are shown in fig .",
    "[ zze : angm ] .",
    "we see that the effect of the anomalous coupling is to increase the average angle between the @xmath4 s while , at the same time , to reduce the average angle between the @xmath4 and the electron .",
    "furthermore , the anomalous interaction also favors higher invariant masses for the @xmath125 pairs , since the new couplings are proportional to the photon momentum , which are very large in the case of backscattered photons .    despite the large sensitivity of the @xmath93 process to the anomalous couplings @xmath71",
    ", we verified that the anomalous @xmath8 distributions for the couplings @xmath62 and @xmath63 are indistinguishable , since all the cases give rise to distributions that exhibit the same general behaviour .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the process @xmath93 can only indicate the existence of anomalous couplings , but not their origins and explicit form .",
    "we also verified that in the case of the @xmath91 process , the deviations from the sm predictions for the kinematical distributions is equivalent to the @xmath93 process . in spite of giving looser bounds on the anomalous couplings ,",
    "the @xmath91 process has a large cross section which can give rise to a substantial statistic .    in figs .",
    "[ wzn : e]-[wzn : angm ] we exhibit some distributions for the @xmath96 process for the sm and also including the anomalous coupling @xmath126 , which corresponds to a @xmath8 deviation in the total cross section .",
    "we verified that , in this process , the behaviour of the anomalous distributions for the @xmath8 limits ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) are basically the same , and consequently they are indistinguishable . one interesting property of the @xmath95 anomalous",
    "vertex is that its intensity is linearly related to the photon momentum , and consequently its contribution to the processes is more important for highly energetic photons , whose energy is close to the maximum of the laser backscattering spectrum .",
    "therefore , the presence of the anomalous vertex increases the available energy for the reaction causing the distribution of momenta and energy of the final gauge bosons to be shifted towards high energy ( see figs .",
    "[ wzn : e ] and [ wzn : pt ] ) .",
    "this argument allows us to conclude that the invariant mass distributions of the vector bosons are also increased at high invariant masses , as can be seen from fig.[wzn : angm ] .",
    "in this paper we studied the capability of an @xmath0 collider , operating in the @xmath1 mode to search for anomalous four - gauge - boson interactions .",
    "we concentrated on those that contain at least one photon and that do not exhibit a trilinear coupling associated to the it , and required the anomalous lagrangians to be invariant under a custodial @xmath31 and under local @xmath32 symmetries .",
    "one interesting property of the interactions we analyzed is that the available low energy constraints on these anomalous couplings are very loose .",
    "the search for anomalous couplings has been performed through the analyses of production of gauge boson pairs , @xmath128 ( @xmath19 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 and @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) .",
    "our results show that @xmath93 and @xmath91 are the most sensitive processes to the anomalous couplings involving two photons , @xmath62 and @xmath115 .",
    "the @xmath8 limits on these couplings obtained from the study of the total cross section for the @xmath129 production are approximately one order magnitude better than the limits using the @xmath116 mode @xcite and a factor of 5 worse than the limits coming from the @xmath20 mode @xcite . the anomalous coupling @xmath95 , which only involves one photon in the quartic vertex , can not be efficiently studied in the @xmath20 or @xmath116 modes of the collider , being @xmath96 the process most sensitive to it .",
    "the bottom line of our work is that an @xmath0 collider operating in the @xmath1 mode will be able to increase substantially the potential of analyses of anomalous four - gauge - boson interactions with respect to the @xmath0 mode . despite of the @xmath1 mode being more sensitive to the presence of further contributions to the standard model",
