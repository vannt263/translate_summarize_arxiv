    "the steady launch of micro- and nano- remote - sensing satellites is opening new possibilities for monitoring natural and human - driven processes on the surface of the planet .",
    "these instruments obtain imagery with resolutions of a few meters ; when assembled as constellations , they are expected to offer re - imaging intervals on the order of days for any given point on earth .",
    "change detection at these spatial and temporal scales becomes a freshly challenging problem .",
    "one key feature of imagery from a constellation of lightweight satellites is that it derives from many different cameras , with individually distinct geometrical issues ( e.g. lens distortions ) .",
    "this can lead to inconsistent registration and photometric calibration . in these circumstances",
    ", traditional pixel - based change detection techniques can no longer be relied upon .",
    "further , pixel - based methods have always required of the analyst a certain artful , ad hoc selection of features and a decision threshold on the histogram of features .",
    "( for recent reviews and references to the extensive literature on change detection in remote sensing imagery , see @xcite . ) one would like to be able , quite generally , to select any pair of time - separated images of a scene and identify locations that exhibit significant change .    within a remote - sensing image ,",
    "human - ordered structures are often set off by sharp edges , and in particular sharp corners , where pixel gradients are large in multiple directions .",
    "local features such as those derived from david lowe s scale invariant feature transform ( sift ) , @xcite , are both _",
    "local _ and _ specific _ to points of sharp contrast within an image .",
    "they are therefore sensitive to salient features of buildings , roads , pipelines , fields and furrows , reservoirs , clearcuts , slag heaps , and fluid discharge , to name a few examples , as well as to edges of forests , glaciers , or deserts , wherever sharp boundaries are marked on the landscape .",
    "sift features also offer some invariance to the position , scale , and projected geometry of features within an image .",
    "a set of relatively novel approaches to the change detection problem  @xcite seek to exploit these properties by matching local features across time - sequenced pairs of images .",
    "the idea behind local feature matching is as follows . the machine first extracts keypoints and descriptors defining local features for each of a pair of images . for every keypoint in one image ,",
    "a keypoint is sought in the other image that is close to the first in both image geometry and descriptor space .",
    "assuming stringent standards in this matching process , matched keypoints indicate a correspondence between local patches in the two images .",
    "unmatched keypoints can result from variations in the way the images were captured , failures of the matching algorithm , or actual changes in structures on the ground .",
    "the trick , of course , is to tease apart those possibilities .",
    "this can be done by considering the keypoints in the immediate neighborhood of a given unmatched keypoint .",
    "statistical anomalies in the matches for that set of keypoints , as compared to the matches of keypoints globally on the image , are indicative of actual , on - the - ground change .",
    "dellinger et al .",
    "@xcite implemented this idea by modeling the appearance of sift keypoints as a binomial point process on the image .",
    "given the number of matched keypoints on a neighborhood , they computed the probability that the total number of detected keypoints on the neighborhood would be greater than or equal to the number found .",
    "a low probability indicates an excess of detected as compared to matched keypoints , which can then be thresholded to give a binary change / no - change proposal for the neighborhood . in our experience",
    ", the binomial statistical model significantly outperforms a naive comparison of keypoint match rates between a neighborhood and the image as a whole .    despite the invariances built into the sift features , their limitations make the change detection protocol vulnerable to variations in atmospheric conditions , in satellite and solar viewing angles , and in geometric issues with image capture .",
    "these are familiar challenges for any change detection algorithm . in this case",
    "the problem manifests as a very low global match rate between sift keypoints .",
    "we often observe match rates as low as a few percent , even for a pair of images from a single provider with little obvious human - interpretable change .",
    "when almost all keypoints remain unmatched , distinguishing those few that do nt match due to on - the - ground change becomes a needle - in - the - haystack problem .",
    "the statistics do nt support a reliable comparison between a given neighborhood and the rest of the image .",
    "very often the problem lies not with matching , per se .",
    "rather , the sift algorithm identifies different structures in the two images on which to extract features . in this case , relaxing the match criterion simply trades the problem of unmatched keypoints for spurious matches .    pursuing these observations",
    ", we offer steps to operationalize change detection in the generalized sense imagined above .",
    "the critical requirement is a high keypoint match rate in regions of the image where there is no significant on - the - ground change .",
    "we approach this challenge in three parts : ( 1 ) we introduce kaze features  @xcite as an alternate local feature detector .",
    "constructed through nonlinear diffusion filtering , kaze features improve on sift invariances and add a measure of invariance to blurring , gaussian noise , and nonlinear deformations of the images .",
    "( 2 ) we relax the initial match criteria for keypoints , admitting as possible matches the k - nearest - neighbors in descriptor space , but then vet these proposals with a spatial proximity test and a bi - directional consistency check : a match of keypoint @xmath0 in image one to keypoint @xmath1 in image two is accepted only if the top available match for keypoint @xmath1 is likewise keypoint @xmath0 .",
    "together these tactics push our average keypoint match rate above 30% . finally , ( 3 ) we propose a statistical test on the distribution of matched keypoints that inverts the roles of modeled and tested data from dellinger et al . and can be expressed in terms of a marked , inhomogeneous poisson point process on the image",
    ". the critical advantage of this new formulation is control : by varying the probability threshold , the generation of change proposals can be made to be as permissive or selective as desired .",
    "although in the long term we envision applications on high - time - resolution image sequences from micro- and nano - satellite constellations , we work here with national agriculture imagery program ( naip ) aerial imagery of california , predominantly from years 2010 and 2012  @xcite .",
    "the design choice was to test the algorithm on a readily available image product , as delivered .",
    "we accessed the naip imagery from the public data catalog of google earth engine  @xcite . via the earth engine interface",
    ", the images were downsampled twice by averaging on 2x2-pixel squares , from native 1-m resolution , and served in earth engine standard epsg:4326 projection .",
    "naip imagery comes radiometrically corrected , but calibrations are not consistent from year 2010 to year 2012 .",
    "the algorithm nonetheless performs in this environment .    as part of our contribution",
    ", we present a small benchmark dataset for change detection on this imagery , 100 pairs of images hand - selected and hand - labeled for change or lack thereof .",
    "it is a matter of interpretation as to what constitutes `` significant '' or `` interesting '' change  the change we want to capture . as a working definition",
    ", we resolved to seek changes in structures of the sort captured by local features , concentrated in an area covering at least one percent of the image frame .",
    "the positive instances in the dataset consist of large - scale works of residential , industrial , and civic construction .",
    "the paper will proceed as follows .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : method ] by reviewing the algorithm of dellinger et al .",
    "based on sift - feature matching and the binomial statistical model . in sections  [ subsec :",
    "kaze][subsec : statstests ] we explain and explore the consequences of the algorithmic developments enumerated above , and in  [ subsec : pit ] we incorporate a routine for aggregating change proposals across an image . in  [ sec : benchmark ] we describe the genesis of our benchmark dataset . in  [ sec : results ] we present our results : on hand - curated image pairs , we observe the challenges associated with low overall match rates and , by contrast , the consolidation of change centers and elimination of false detections which we achieve with better feature matching . on the benchmark dataset",
    ", we explore the response characteristics of the algorithm with varying change probability threshold , showing a peak overall accuracy of 68% and a proportion of true positives among total detections that spikes to 100% .",
    "we want to identify distinguishing features of a remote - sensing image and map them to corresponding elements of a later or earlier image of the same scene . where such a mapping does not exist , we need to be able to determine if that is or is not a result of a material difference between the two scenes .    to execute on this program , we need three components",
    "the first is a protocol for extracting features from the two scenes .",
    "these features should capture mid - level semantics of the scene while being robust to fine - grained variations caused by differences in the image - capture process .",
    "the standard approach for image - matching applications is to use lowe s sift features .",
    "however , that algorithm was developed to target invariances to the affine transformations that are common in digital photographic applications .",
    "we would instead prefer features that are robust to the particular hazards of remote sensing , including differences in illumination , solar and sensor viewing angle , lens distortion , and the sensors themselves .",
    "the second component is a mechanism for matching features between the two scenes .",
    "typically this would be based on some metric of closeness on feature descriptor space , followed by a validation check such as lowe s ratio test or a test of geometric consistency between query and target keypoints .",
    "the final component is a statistical model that captures the expected natural variability in matching , since perfect matching is impossible even where there is no meaningful change between two scenes .",
    "this model would be used to test for atypical distributions of matches that correspond to meaningful change .",
    "we explore each of these components in turn , taking the work of dellinger et al .",
    "@xcite as baseline .    in their process ,",
    "dellinger et al . begin by extracting sift keypoints and descriptors for two time - sequenced images of a scene .",
    "they tentatively match each keypoint in one image to the keypoint in the other image with the closest descriptor .",
    "they then filter these proposals by checking against a ransac - estimated affine transformation between the two images . in developing a mechanism to identify change points from among the set of unmatched keypoints , the authors make two key assumptions :    1 .",
    "detected keypoints are distributed on the image according to a binomial spatial point process .",
    "2 .   in the absence of on - the - ground change , matched keypoints are distributed with the same binomial probability of success as detected keypoints .",
    "we will return to examine the validity of these assumptions , but in general one would not expect a binomial or poisson process to model the spatial distribution of keypoints .",
    "the keypoints cluster along the distinctive underlying spatial structures captured in the image , and especially outside of densely built urban areas , this leads to distributions that might better be described in terms of nodes , filaments , and voids .    as a practical mechanism to account for inhomogeneity or interaction between keypoints , dellinger et al . recompute the binomial probability of success locally on each neighborhood subject to the statistical test .",
    "they elect to model the matches , determining the local density of the point process by counting the number of matches @xmath2 on a fixed - sized neighborhood @xmath3 .",
    "given @xmath4 total matches on the image , the local probability of success is @xmath5 .",
    "this defines a binomial model @xmath6 for the distribution of keypoints , of which @xmath7 total are detected on the image .",
    "they then test the appearance of keypoints against this model .",
    "if an anomalously large number of keypoints are detected on a neighborhood , they flag the neighborhood for change .    given @xmath7 detected keypoints on the image , @xmath8 detected keypoints on a neighborhood , and a hypothesized local probability of success @xmath9 , the neighborhood is flagged as a candidate for change when the probability of finding @xmath8 or more keypoints is smaller than some threshold @xmath10 :    @xmath11    ( in the referenced paper the probability is translated into a fraction of detected keypoints and the threshold @xmath10 correspondingly rescaled by a factor of @xmath7 . )",
    "each unmatched keypoint defines a neighborhood @xmath3 , taken to be the ball of radius @xmath12 around that keypoint and truncated if necessary at image edges . the change proposal , while centered on a specific unmatched keypoint , implicates the distribution of matched and unmatched keypoints on the entire neighborhood .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath10 are tuned according to the requirements of a specific application .",
    "the threshold @xmath10 determines the stringency of the change criterion , while the radius @xmath12 defines the spatial precision of the test . for precision",
    ", one would like @xmath12 to be as small as possible , but of course a smaller neighborhood offers fewer keypoints on which to derive a reliable statistical model .",
    "this becomes a limiting factor especially when image - wide match rates are low . in the extreme case",
    "in which there are no matched keypoints on a neighborhood , the above test will necessarily flag the neighborhood for change - yet the lack of matches could just as well occur on a small neighborhood of an image whose keypoints are only sparsely matched due to differential effects of image capture in its image pair .    broadly speaking , the statistical test checks for a local deficit of matched keypoints ( or corresponding excess of detected keypoints ) as compared to the image - wide mean .",
    "good global matching is essential if the local deficit is to stand out against the global match background . because of the importance of high match rates , we devote significant attention to this issue .      inspired by alcantarilla et al .",
    "@xcite , we examine the impact of using kaze features instead of sift features for change detection .",
    "kaze features are based on nonlinear diffusion filtering , which tends to respect edges and spatial structure more than the gaussian scale space of sift .",
    "because the imagery we are analyzing ( i.e. buildings , roads , agricultural fields ) is highly geometric , this seems intuitively justifiable .",
    "for tests of keypoint distribution and matching , we collected a corpus of image pairs from across the state of california , paired by naip data years 2010 and 2012 .",
    "we began by specifying eight seed locations in the state , with half in heavily urban areas and half in suburban or rural areas .",
    "for each seed we obtained the 2010 and 2012 naip images from google earth engine at 64 locations , in an 8 x 8 grid spaced at increments of 0.02 degrees latitude and 0.03 degrees longitude to the north and east , respectively , of the seed location .",
    "this produces 512 image pairs semi - randomly distributed across a variety of land cover types .",
    "each image is 512 pixels wide by approximately 400 pixels high , varying in the north - south direction due to the epsg:4326 projection .",
    "( across the state of california , vertical image size ranges from 435 pixels at tijuana to 383 pixels at the oregon border . ) regardless , an image represents an area @xmath13 x @xmath13 on the ground , with an approximate resolution of @xmath14 .",
    "we will refer to this set of images as our matching image corpus .",
    "we extracted kaze keypoints and descriptors using the opencv 3.2 implementation .",
    "the kaze algorithm includes one dimensionless sensitivity parameter , called @xmath15 , although this is entirely distinct from the binomial probability threshold we refer to often in the course of this paper . when using the default value for the kaze threshold , 0.001 , we found significantly fewer keypoints than with sift ( on average only @xmath16 ) . tuning this parameter to 0.0003",
    ", we found roughly the same number , although this varies across our matching image corpus between @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( median @xmath19 ) .",
    "we use this parameter value for the remainder of the paper .    to explore the extent to which keypoints are distributed according to a binomial ( or the closely related poisson ) point process",
    ", we analyzed the distribution on our matching image corpus . using a rectangular grid of 16 x 20 neighborhoods ( `` patches '' ) , we calculated the cumulative distribution function of the number of keypoints per patch and computed the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) statistic relative to a binomial distribution with the same total number of keypoints and mean number of keypoints per patch .",
    "( in some cases we discarded a small number of pixels from the edge of the image to ensure an equal number of pixels in each patch . )",
    "the resulting k - s statistic shows a large variation across our matching image corpus , with values as high as 0.5 .",
    "this decreases to approximately 0.05 for images with the highest number of total keypoints .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : binomialtests ] .",
    "the lowest k - s statistics tend to occur in images with consistent land cover throughout , such as the urban scene of fig .",
    "[ fig : binomialtests](b ) , while higher values occur in scenes that include distinct land - cover boundaries , as for the reservoir spreading its tendrils among alternately densely and sparsely tree - covered mountain slopes of fig .  [",
    "fig : binomialtests](c ) . of particular note",
    "is the excess of squares exhibiting zero keypoints in the latter scene .",
    "the statistical model described above posits an inhomogeneous point process to account for some of this variation .",
    "given the readily apparent filaments and voids in high k - s statistic scenes , improved modeling might focus instead on interaction among keypoints .",
    "finally , in passing , we observe that this analysis of keypoint distribution might be useful for classifying images into those with homogeneous versus varied land cover , although that lies beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "as suggested by previous work , kaze features result in significantly higher match rates than sift features for the same images@xcite . for matching we employed a routine from opencv 3.2 called bfmatcher.knnmatch ( ) . given a keypoint descriptor in one image , it seeks the @xmath20 closest elements in descriptor space across all keypoint descriptors generated for the other image . in our initial approach ,",
    "we set @xmath21 .",
    "we then imposed two consistency checks :    first , we filtered these match proposals with a geometric proximity test , discarding those that are separated in image coordinates by a distance of more than 4 pixels .",
    "we chose this value based on an estimate of the average registration offset between our images , which is approximately half this value .",
    "a hard proximity cutoff is appropriate in a context with known , bounded offsets in image registration .",
    "establishing a fixed cutoff requires zero time and succeeds always .",
    "by contrast , generating a homography transform requires processing time and is subject to failure when based on potentially spurious nearest - descriptor - space proposals .",
    "the drawback to the proximity test is that it requires _ a priori _ knowledge of the average image registration error .",
    "we experimented with a dynamic approach , determining a cutoff on each image from the histogram of pixel offsets for the proposals returned by bfmatcher ( ) . faced with a new source of imagery , we could deploy this routine in preprocessing to determine an average registration offset , but here we used our experience with naip imagery in fixing a 4-pixel cut - off .",
    "second , we required that matches be symmetric , such that if the proposed match for keypoint @xmath0 in image one is keypoint @xmath1 in image two , then the proposed match for keypoint @xmath1 is likewise keypoint @xmath0 .",
    "this cross - check expresses a logically necessary condition for two keypoints to match , but it is not met by all proposals which pass the proximity test ; we found that approximately @xmath22 of proposed matches fail this test for our matching image corpus .",
    "we define the match rate for a pair of images as twice the number of successful matches divided by the sum of the total number of keypoints detected in each image . using sift features on our matching image corpus ,",
    "the average match rate was @xmath23 , with a small positive correlation with total keypoint number .",
    "when we relaxed the proximity test to 8 pixels , the average match rate increased to @xmath24 ; when we tightened it to 2 pixels , the average match rate decreased to @xmath25 . with kaze features and",
    "the 4-pixel proximity cut - off , the average match rate was @xmath26 , 2.3 times higher than with sift .    to improve our match rates , we continued to use kaze features and expanded the parameters of the initial search performed by bfmatcher.knnmatch ( ) to return the top @xmath20 nearest neighbors in descriptor space , typically with @xmath27 . in @xmath28 of cases",
    "the nearest neighbor passed the ( 4-pixel ) proximity test ; in the remaining cases we searched for the next - closest match that passed .",
    "we repeated this search procedure , reversing the role of the two images , and performed the cross - check described above .",
    "this approach increased the average match rate to @xmath29 .",
    "results of these match tests are summarized in fig .",

    "we set out to detect instances of concerted human activity on the landscape .",
    "the algorithm as presented is sensitive to construction and demolition , clearing and regrading of the land , shifts in agricultural use , and natural processes that impact sharp divisions in land - cover classes . at the same time , we want to avoid detecting seasonal vegetative change and small - scale , transitory elements such as street traffic .",
    "the division between change of interest to human operators and all other differences between images is necessarily subjective .",
    "we still have not settled on a viable distinction in agricultural contexts .",
    "construction , however , is relatively straightforward to observe and define .",
    "for this reason , and for its inherent interest , we made construction the basis of our benchmark dataset .",
    "we established a minimal scale to filter small , scattered elements from consideration : we require that our target change regions cover at least one percent of the image frame . at our current working resolution ,",
    "that means a change region , if square , extends minimally two hundred meters on a side .",
    "clearly we are excluding some objects of potential interest , such as single - home construction .",
    "in actuality , the smallest region we included in the benchmark dataset covers 1.6% of the area of the image , and even this may have been too small : our algorithm struggles to detect these smallest instances , given the parameter settings required to limit false - positive detections .    the bulk of our examples we found by hand - search of imagery in google earth , supplemented by news reports of construction from 2011 . from earth engine we downloaded the scene for years 2010 and 2012 containing the construction of interest ,",
    "often off - centered so as to avoid any secondary confounding instances within the frame .",
    "we then scrolled until we found a disjoint , nearby ( no more than a tenth of a degree distant ) scene in which any observable change was smaller in extent than our minimal allowed scale . in this way we built a corpus of fifty positive and fifty negative sample image pairs , from predominantly urban and surburban contexts , but including also some examples with surrounding farmed fields , desert , and green space .",
    "for the fifty pairs exhibiting change , the change region covered on average @xmath30 of the image frame .",
    "the maximum coverage was 31% and the minimum , aforementioned , 1.6% .",
    "the construction examples fall into the following rough categories : twelve housing subdivisions , seven box stores or malls , five parks or athletic facilities , four hospitals , seven schools , two prisons , two cases of highways or roads , five varied industrial / warehouse / office park facilities , and six cases of demolition or site clearing .",
    "we drew polygonal bounding boxes around areas of construction with an image editing tool .",
    "on testing , we considered any intersection of a hand - drawn bounding box with an output aggregated change region to constitute a true positive detection for the scene .",
    "the benchmark dataset is available on github  @xcite .",
    "we begin with some qualitative observations .",
    "the matching design factors most impacting the accuracy of change detection are the feature set ( sift vs. kaze ) and the @xmath20-nearest - neighbor matching protocol .",
    "these variants are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : constructiontiles ] and  [ fig : ccbbtiles ] below .",
    "the original images from 2010 and 2012 appear first , and the sequence below shows keypoints flagged for change under the following four scenarios : sift features ; sift features with knn matching ( @xmath27 ) ; kaze features ; kaze features with knn matching ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the scenes were hand - selected and are separate from the benchmark dataset . for purposes of this demonstration , the probability thresholds @xmath31 were determined to yield roughly comparable numbers of change points on the first of the fig .",
    "[ fig : constructiontiles ] construction scenes .    for all variants in the first sequence , the construction of museum and plaza at center of the frame is correctly identified .",

    "top - left , a progression can again be seen as improved matching techniques are introduced , from a best accuracy of 56% with sift alone , up to an overall optimal accuracy 68% with kaze features and knn ( @xmath27 ) matching .",
    "blanket change or no - change assertions across images would yield 50% accuracies , but as our program yields compact , targeted proposals , it could have fared much worse : for the optimal settings , at threshold @xmath32 , the average fractional area of a proposed change window is @xmath33 ; at @xmath34 this drops to @xmath35 .",

    "as far as possible , we have tried to offer insights as to likely causes of misdetections , e.g. , low match rates or clear differences in illumination . despite the broad challenge of the task , the program makes credible , targeted assertions of change across a wide variety of scenes .",
    "we have shown an ability to identify regions of large - scale construction against a background of diurnal and seasonal change . our strategy was to seek improved feature extraction and matching , which allows a neighborhood with many unmatched keypoints to register as a statistical anomaly against a a robust statistical model of matched keypoints on the image .",

    "<S> we present an algorithm capable of identifying a wide variety of human - induced change on the surface of the planet by analyzing matches between local features in time - sequenced remote sensing imagery . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate feature sets , match protocols , and the statistical modeling of feature matches . with application of kaze features , k - nearest - neighbor descriptor matching , and geometric proximity and bi - directional match consistency checks , average match rates increase more than two - fold over the previous standard . in testing our platform , we developed a small , labeled benchmark dataset expressing large - scale residential , industrial , and civic construction , along with null instances , in california between the years 2010 and 2012 . </S>",
    "<S> on the benchmark set , our algorithm makes precise , accurate change proposals on two - thirds of scenes . </S>",
    "<S> further , the detection threshold can be tuned so that all or almost all proposed detections are true positives . </S>"
