    "for instance , the radial abundance distributions of o , n , mg , and other heavy elements derived by daflon & cunha ( @xcite ) from a sample of ob stars show a minimum near 8  kpc ( although they have not accentuated the importance of this behaviour and approximated the radial abundance profiles by a linear function with a negative slope ) . the existence of a plateau in the oxygen abundance distribution has also been reported by andrievsky et al .",

    "if there were no radial and/or azimuthal migrations of element x due to spiral stellar density waves , the residual abundance would be zero during the consequent evolution of the gas disk .",
    "however , a considerable redistribution of element x near corotation is evident in fig .  [ fig4 ] as indicated by large deviations of [ x / h]@xmath79 from zero . the maximum deviations of @xmath80  dex are found between the spiral arms , whereas the deviation is noticeably smaller in the region where spiral arms cross corotation .",

    "an obvious ( and impressive ) difference is seen between the radial [ x / h ] profiles along the upper and right cuts .",
    "the former shows a sharp drop near the position of corotation at @xmath82  kpc , while the latter has a plateau ( with a size of approximately 4  kpc ) at the position of corotation .",
    "the radial profiles of [ x / h ] inside corotation demonstrate substantially smaller deviations from the initial axisymmetric radial profile , which implies little redistribution of heavy elements in the inner galactic regions .",
    "a small number of metallicity indicators ( such as hii regions or planetary nebula ) usually makes it difficult to determine the radial abundance profiles along a particular radial direction in a galaxy . in this respect ,",
    "the azimuthally averaged radial abundance distribution is of particular interest . the azimuthally averaged radial distribution of [ x / h ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] at two different times after the beginning of simulations .",
    "the dotted line plots the initial axisymmetric abundance distribution of element x. the development of a plateau in the azimuthally averaged profiles of [ x / h ] is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . taking into account that the spiral perturbing force saturates after 200  myr from the beginning of simulations , only two revolution periods ( @xmath83  myr ) are needed to develop a significant plateau with a size of 3  kpc .",
    "the plateau grows in time and reaches a size of approximately 4.5  kpc after 2.5  gyr .",
    "the radial redistribution of element x with respect to hydrogen is also visible in the plots  a substantial amount of element x ( approximately @xmath84 by mass ) is pushed radially away in the disk by the action of spiral stellar density waves .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , the gravitational field of the stellar spiral arms is known to radially mix the stars and cold molecular clouds and transport dust radially away in the disks of spiral galaxies ( sellwood & binney @xcite , vorobyov & shchekinov @xcite ) . in order to understand the effect that the stellar spiral arms have on the distribution of heavy elements in the warm gas phase of spiral galaxies , we consider a large - scale gas flow in the disk of our model galaxy . figure  [ fig7 ] shows the residual velocity field of gas superimposed on the gas surface density distribution at @xmath85  gyr .",
    "the residual velocity field of the gas is obtained by subtracting the circular motion of gas due to the combined axisymmetric gravitational potential of stars and dark matter halo from the total gas velocity .",
    "the residual velocity field shows a complicated flow pattern",
    ". however , several regular features of the gas flow are clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . on average ,",
    "the gas streams radially inward along the outer edge of a spiral arm and radially outward along the inner edge .",
    "the radial velocities are considerable and may become as high as @xmath86  km  s@xmath11 near the corotation circle .",
    "these large - scale radial gas motions are caused by the gravitational field of stellar spiral density waves . a hydrogen atom ( as well as any other element coupled to hydrogen )",
    "is exposed to an additional gravitational attraction of the stellar density wave when it approaches the spiral arm .",
    "if the atom is closer to the concave part of the spiral , it will be pushed radially outward . on the other hand ,",
    "if the atom is closer to the convex part of the spiral , it will be given an inward radial pull .",
    "this two - fold action of the spiral stellar density wave on the dynamics of a single particle is schematically depicted by vorobyov & shchekinov ( @xcite ) in their fig .",
    ". the gravitational field of stellar spirals can cause a considerable change in the angular momentum of a particular element ( it could be either a gas parcel or a star ) but the the total angular momentum of the system remains largely unchanged .",
    "the effect of spiral stellar density waves on the dynamics of gas ( and heavy element admixtures within it ) is strongest around the corotation resonance , where a gas parcel _ rotates in phase with the stellar spiral density wave _ and is subject to the maximal radial migrations .",
    "considerably away from corotation , the gas parcel frequently passes through the spiral arms and the gravitational influence of the latter mostly cancels out ( as is seen in the trajectories of test particles in fig .  5 of vorobyov & shchekinov @xcite ) .",
    "the net result of the radial migrations of heavy elements is a flattening of the pre - existing negative radial abundance gradients near corotation . since the abundance of element x is larger inside corotation than outside it , the radial gas flow exports many more atoms of element x outside corotation than it takes from there .",
    "this process continues until a near homogeneous abundance distribution is set on both sides of corotation .",
    "the smearing of negative abundance gradients near corotation can be better understood in terms of anticyclones that develop between the spiral arms and are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] by the larger ellipses .",
    "the anticyclone flow of gas is approximately shown by the long arrows .",
    "it is clearly seen that the anticyclones push the gas from inside corotation to the regions outside it and vice versa , thus producing an effective mixing of elements and flattening of negative abundance gradients at the position of anticyclones ( i.e. between the spiral arms ) .",
    "the small ellipses show the location of two cyclones that form in the disk near the point where spiral arms cross the corotation circle .",
    "two approaching streams of gas in the cyclone ( shown by the long arrows in fig .  [ fig7 ] )",
    "meet near corotation , which creates a contact discontinuity and a subsequent sharp drop in the abundance distribution at corotation .",
    "such a step - like feature is clearly seen in the radial abundance distribution of element x calculated along the radial cut that passes through the position of the cyclone ( see the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the formation of cyclones and anticyclones in the gas disk is a consequence of a non - axisymmetric gravitational field of the stellar spiral density wave .",
    "a gas parcel that orbits sufficiently close to corotation ( @xmath87  kpc on both sides of it ) is exposed to a strong resonant forcing of the spiral gravitational field .",
    "such resonant forcing produces anticyclones and associated considerable radial migrations of gas and heavy elements .",
    "an example of trajectories around corotation is shown by the solid line in fig .  5 of vorobyov & shchekinov ( @xcite ) .",
    "the same type of `` horse - shoe '' orbit was found by sellwood & binney ( @xcite ) in a stellar disk around corotation .",
    "we note that the existence of such cyclone and anticyclone motions was indeed revealed in the gas disks of ngc  3631 ( fridman et al .",
    "@xcite ) and ngc  157 ( fridman et al .",
    "the anticyclone motions of cold gas clouds around corotation in spiral galaxies were also suggested by sellwood & preto ( @xcite ) .",
    "another important implication seen in fig  [ fig7 ] is that the gas _ is not pushed away from corotation everywhere along the corotation perimeter_. an assumption of the outflow of gas away from corotation usually involves a two - fold effect of spiral shocks ( triggered by stellar density waves ) on the gas that passes through the shock front . because of differential rotation , the gas that orbits inside / outside corotation is decelerated / accelerated at the shock front and is driven radially inward / outward from corotation .",
    "this conclusion may be misleading because it completely neglects the long - range influence of the gravitational field of spiral arms , which appear to have a much stronger effect on the gas dynamics than the spiral shock fronts .",
    "the gas is indeed pushed away from corotation by the action of anticyclones but is returned to corotation by the action of cyclones .",
    "however , the azimuthally averaged gas surface density distribution shows a mild gas depression near corotation as compared to the initial distribution , implying that anticyclones are more powerful than cyclones .",
    "simulations of the previous section have shown that the spiral stellar density waves induce anticyclone flows of gas near corotation and , by doing so , flatten the pre - existing negative abundance gradients of heavy elements in the warm gas .",
    "this effect is limited to several kiloparsecs on each side of corotation , and the abundance distribution retains ( on average ) its initial slope at radial distances that are considerably far from corotation .",
    "this implies that if the stellar spirals are entirely confined within corotation , we should not expect to see a considerable flattening of the negative abundance gradients .",
    "we check this assumption by considering model  2 in which we choose the amplitude @xmath31 of the spiral stellar gravitational potential so that the stellar density waves are mostly localized within corotation .",
    "this means that they have a negligible effect on the gas dynamics outside corotation .",
    "the same expression for the amplitude @xmath31 as in model  1 is adopted .",
    "however , the exponent @xmath65 decreases linearly with radius from @xmath66 at @xmath64  kpc to @xmath88 ( in contrast to @xmath67 in model  1 ) at @xmath44  kpc .",

    "we note that the maximum , non - axisymmetric gravitational acceleration never exceeds @xmath77 of the total axisymmetric gravity force . at the position of corotation @xmath76  kpc , @xmath72 approximately equals @xmath91 and it sharply decreases beyond corotation .",

    "[ fig8 ] show the evolution of the gas surface density at two different times as indicated in each panel .",
    "the gas response to the gravitational field of spiral stellar density waves in model  2 is remarkably different from that of model  1 .",

    "we make two radial cuts in the gas disk at @xmath85  gyr and calculate the abundance profiles of element x along these cuts .",
    "the cuts are drawn in the upper - left panel of fig .",

    "it is obvious that the deviation from the initial unperturbed axisymmetric distribution is much smaller in model  2 than in model  1 .",

    "[ fig9 ] by the dashed - dotted line is almost indistinguishable from the initial unperturbed distribution .",
    "the difference between the two models in the efficiency of flattening of element abundance gradients can be readily understood if we consider the residual gas velocity field which is obtained by subtracting the circular velocity of gas ( due to the axisymmetric gravitational field ) from the total gas velocity .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] presents the residual gas velocity field superimposed onto the gas surface density distribution at @xmath85  gyr .",

    ", we consider more tightly - wound spirals typical for the early - type sa - sb galaxies .",
    "the model galaxy has the same initial parameters as model  1 of sect .",
    "[ model1 ] but a pitch angle @xmath96 .",
    "the resulting azimuthally averaged radial abundance profiles of element x are plotted in fig .  [ fig11 ] at two different evolutionary times .",
    "the initial radial profile is shown by the dotted line for comparison .",
    "it is evident that the size of the plateau around corotation decreases by at least a factor of 2 as compared to that in model  1 .",
    "this effect can be understood if we consider the residual gas velocity field shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] for the model with @xmath96 .",
    "this velocity field is calculated in the same manner as in sect .",
    "[ model1 ] and is superimposed on the gas surface density distribution at @xmath85  gyr .",
    "the position of corotation is drawn by the circle and the anticyclones are drawn by the ellipses . a comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] indicates that the anticyclone flows of gas are much less pronounced in tightly - wound galaxies with @xmath97 than in galaxies with @xmath54 .",
    "the radial gas velocities and the overall extent of anticyclones are noticeably smaller in tightly - wound spirals . for instance , the maximum and average radial velocities around corotation in the @xmath54 model  1 are @xmath98  km  s@xmath11 and @xmath99  km  s@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the inward radial velocities are usually larger then the outward ones by approximately @xmath100 . on the other hand , in the @xmath97 model with more tightly - wound arms",
    "the maximum and average radial velocities are @xmath99  km  s@xmath11 and @xmath101  km  s@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "it is not surprising that the efficiency of radial redistribution of heavy elements and the sizes of plateaus around corotation are noticeably lower in the @xmath97 model than in the @xmath54 model  1 .",
    "the radial positions of a logarithmic stellar spiral at zero phase ( @xmath34 , see eq .",
    "[ nonsym ] ) can be determined as @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 is the characteristic radius of the stellar spiral at @xmath105 .",
    "equation  [ spiral ] becomes inapplicable when the separation between _ the gas spirals _ is considered , because there exist a non - negligible azimuthal phase shift between the stellar and gas spirals caused by the non - solid - body rotation curve of the gas disk .",
    "this phase shift is particularly large outside corotation where the gas rotation curve declines with radius . as a consequence",
    ", the separation between the gas spirals decreases considerably , especially in the case of larger pitch angles .",
    "therefore , we use a visual estimate for the radial separation between the gas spirals .",
    "our numerical simulations indicate that the anticyclone flows _ are bounded by the adjacent gas spiral arms_. this implies that the sizes of plateaus in the radial profiles of heavy elements should be proportional to the radial separation between the gas spiral arms on both sides of corotation .",
    "indeed , a visual inspection of fig .  [ fig7 ] and fig .  [ fig12 ] indicates that the radial separation is at least a factor of 2 larger in the @xmath54 model than in the @xmath97 model .",
    "consequently , the size of the plateau around corotation is also approximately a factor of 2 larger in the @xmath54 model .",
    "hence , the radial separation between the gas spiral and an associated anticyclone activity is expected to increase along the hubble sequence .",
    "it is now not surprising that both grand - design galaxies ngc  3631 and ngc  157 , where giant anticyclones have been observed ( fridman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , are of sc and sbc types , respectively .",
    "we conclude that plateaus in the radial abundance distribution of heavy elements have a tendency to increase in size along the hubble sequence .",
    "two - armed spiral galaxies have been considered so far . in multi - armed galaxies ( @xmath106 ) ,",
    "the radial separation between the gas spiral arms is smaller than in two - armed galaxies with the same pitch angle .",
    "this should also reduce the sizes of anticyclones and the associated efficiency of radial heavy element redistribution .",
    "we leave this issue for a subsequent study .",
    "we have studied numerically the dynamics of warm gas and heavy elements in spiral galaxies .",
    "two types of two - armed spiral galaxies are considered in which corotation is situated approximately in the middle of the spiral pattern ( type  1 ) and at the very end of it ( type  2 ) , respectively .",
    "type  2 spiral galaxies show little radial redistribution of heavy elements in the warm gas disk .",
    "conversely , type  1 spirals are distinguished by a substantial radial redistribution of heavy elements around corotation .",
    "strong cyclones and anticyclones around corotation are generated by the non - axisymmetric gravitational field of spiral stellar density waves in type  1 galaxies .",
    "the anticyclone flows transport gas from inside corotation to the regions outside it and vice versa . if the radial abundances of heavy elements are characterized by a negative slope , the anticyclones bring many more atoms of heavy elements outside corotation than they import inside corotation .",
    "this results in a flattening of radial abundance profiles at the position of anticyclones after two revolution periods of a galaxy . on the other hand ,",
    "the cyclone flows generate in - going and out - going streams of gas along the spiral arms .",
    "these streams meet at corotation , producing a contact discontinuity in the gas flow and associated step - like radial profiles of heavy element abundances at the position of cyclones .",
    "nevertheless , the azimuthally averaged radial abundance distributions of heavy elements show _ a well - defined plateau on both sides of corotation _ , implying that anticyclones are more powerful in transporting the heavy elements than cyclones .    the sizes of plateaus around corotation in the azimuthally averaged radial abundance distributions of heavy elements are expected to increase along the hubble sequence in spiral galaxies with equal number of arms .",
    "our numerical simulations show that in two - armed sa - sb galaxies with a pitch angle of @xmath107 , the plateau has a maximum size of 2  kpc .",
    "in contrast , sc galaxies with a pitch angle of @xmath108 have the plateau that can become as large as 4.5  kpc .",
    "a growing efficiency of radial mixing of heavy elements ( and an associated flattening of negative abundance gradients ) along the hubble sequence is related to the increasing radial separation between the spiral arms and a consequent increase in the strength of anticyclones .",
    "a considerable portion of total gas mass in a spiral galaxy may be in the form of cold molecular hydrogen clouds .",
    "our numerical simulations show that the efficiency of radial mixing grows as the gas temperature drops .",
    "a decrease in the restoring force of pressure gradients is responsible for this effect .",
    "however , our numerical hydrodynamics code is not appropriate for the modelling of molecular cloud dynamics , for which the sticky particle codes are well suited .",
    "sellwood & binney ( @xcite ) and sellwood & preto ( @xcite ) have employed n - body simulations to study the dynamics of cold molecular clouds .",
    "they have reported the development of anticyclonic motions at corotation and predicted the flattening of any metallicity gradients within the disc .    in this paper",
    ", we neglect the effect of continuous star formation .",
    "it is a computationally difficult task to self - consistently include the production of heavy elements in the hydrodynamics code .",
    "a possible exception is oxygen which is released mostly by short - living massive stars , for which the instantaneous recycling approximation can be used ( e.g. acharova et al .",
    "our preliminary numerical simulations indicate that the on - going star formation in the spiral arms may change the shape of the plateau at corotation .",
    "more specifically , a mild minimum and maximum in the azimuthally averaged radial abundance profile of oxygen may develop at the inner and outer sides of corotation , respectively .",
    "similar shapes in the radial abundance distribution of oxygen near corotation were reported by acharova et al .",
