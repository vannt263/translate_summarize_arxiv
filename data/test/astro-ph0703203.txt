    "the magnetic dipole moments @xmath4 of neutron stars are observed to decrease with accreted mass , @xmath5 .",
    "evidence of this trend is found in a variety of systems , e.g. low- and high - mass x - ray binaries , and binary radio pulsars with white - dwarf and neutron - star companions @xcite , although there is some debate over whether the trend is monotonic @xcite .",
    "several theoretical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the @xmath6 data , including accelerated ohmic decay @xcite , fluxoid - vortex interactions @xcite , and magnetic screening or burial @xcite . with regard to the latter mechanism ,",
    "@xcite ( hereafter pm04 ) calculated a sequence of two - dimensional , hydromagnetic ( grad - shafranov ) equilibria describing the structure of the magnetically confined mountain of material accreted at the magnetic poles of the neutron star .",
    "the mountain is confined by magnetic stresses near the equator , where the field is compressed @xcite .",
    "these solutions are the first of their kind to explicitly disallow cross - field transport of material as the mountain evolves from its initial to its final state ( cf . *",
    "* ) , as required in the ideal - magnetohydrodynamic ( ideal - mhd ) limit .",
    "pm04 found that @xmath4 is screened substantially above a critical accreted mass @xmath7 , well above previous estimates of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "pm04 calculated equilibria up to @xmath9 , falling short of the mass required ( @xmath10 ) to spin up a neutron star to millisecond periods @xcite .",
    "this is supplied by a large class of mass donors like lmxbs @xcite , even given nonconservative mass transfer @xcite .",
    "grad - shafranov calculations are stymied above @xmath11 by physical effects ( e.g. magnetic bubbles form above the stellar surface ) and numerical effects ( e.g. steep magnetic gradients hinder iterative convergence ) . in this paper",
    ", we extend the @xmath6 relationship to @xmath12 by loading equilibria with @xmath11 into zeus-3d , a multi - purpose time - dependent , ideal - mhd code for astrophysical fluid dynamics , and adding extra mass quasistatically through the outer boundary of the simulation volume .",
    "pm04 also left open the important question of the stability of the hydromagnetic equilibria .",
    "distorted magnetic configurations , in which the polar flux is buried beneath the accreted overburden and compressed into a narrow belt at the magnetic equator , are expected prima facie to be unstable . indeed , the grad - shafranov analysis in pm04 hints at the existence of an instability by predicting ( informally ) the existence of magnetic bubbles as steady - state solutions . in this paper",
    ", we systematically explore the stability of the equilibria by evolving them in zeus-3d , subject to linear and nonlinear perturbations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : stability2 ]",
    ", the necessary theory is summarised and the solution method described .",
    "the formalism of pm04 is again used here .",
    "the numerical grad - shafranov solver is described in appendix b of pm04 and appendix c of @xcite . in section [ sec : burialsetup ] , we verify zeus-3d against a set of test cases relevant to the problem of magnetic burial ; the implementation is described thoroughly in appendix a. in section [ sec : lateburial ] , we explore the late stages of magnetic burial ( @xmath13 ) by adding mass quasistatically to equilibria from pm04 in zeus-3d . in section [ sec : stability ] , we discuss the linear and nonlinear stability of the equilibria in the regime @xmath14 .",
    "the paper concludes , in section [ sec : stabilityconclusion ] , with a discussion of the limitations of our analysis and suggestions for future numerical work .",
    "during accretion onto a neutron star from a binary companion , matter piles up on the polar cap , funnelled by the magnetic tension of the polar magnetic flux tube .",
    "once @xmath5 exceeds @xmath15 , the hydrostatic pressure at the base of the accretion column overcomes the magnetic tension and matter spreads over the stellar surface towards the equator , dragging along frozen - in polar field lines ( pm04 ) .",
    "the distorted magnetic field leads to screening currents which act to decrease the magnetic dipole moment .",
    "figure [ fig : smalla](a ) illustrates the magnetic ` tutu ' formed for @xmath16 , cut off at ten density scale heights .",
    "the polar mountain of accreted material ( dashed contours ) and the pinched , flaring , equatorial magnetic belt ( solid contours ) are plainly seen .    at first glance",
    ", one might expect such equilibria , with their steep density and magnetic field gradients , to be unstable .",
    "interestingly , this expectation is largely false , as we show in section [ sec : stability ] .",
    "we summarise the key equations and notation of magnetic burial here ( pm04 ) .",
    "the steady - state ideal - mhd equations for an isothermal atmosphere ( @xmath17 , i.e. adiabatic index @xmath18 ) reduce to the force equation @xmath19 .",
    "for an axisymmetric configuration in spherical polar coordinates @xmath20 , a flux function @xmath21 generates the magnetic field @xmath22 via @xmath23 .",

    "equations ( [ eqn : gradshafranov ] ) and ( [ fpsiparker ] ) are solved numerically using an iterative relaxation scheme @xcite .",
    "the mean residual as a function of iteration number is shown in figure [ fig : smalla](b ) , corresponding to the grad - shafranov equilibrium for @xmath44 displayed in figure [ fig : smalla](a ) .",

    "we give the formulae for converting between the grad - shafranov code and zeus-3d .",

    "radial logarithmic scaling gives less grid resolution near the outer boundary where the density is least and thus @xmath70 is greater and zeus-3d runs for a longer time .",
    "when importing a grad - shafranov equilibrium ( pm04 ) , whose grid is linear in @xmath71 , into zeus-3d , whose grid is ( in many cases ) logarithmic in @xmath72 , there is no trivial multiplicative factor relating @xmath73 and the required logarithmic @xmath74 scaling through ggen1:x2rat .",
    "the problem can be overcome by rewriting the grad - shafranov code such that its grid is logarithmic in @xmath74 .",
    "this problem is an obstacle in certain sorts of numerical experiments e.g. the bootstrapping method in  4.2 ."
