    "as we have seen in the previous subsection , the naive discretization of the douglas functional conflicts with douglas theorem . in particular , the global minimum of thus discretized functional equals zero rather than the minimal area spanned by the loop .",
    "the reason for such an anomalous behavior can be clearly identified : douglas theorem is valid only for continuous reparametrizations with nonsingular first derivative , while discontinuities of the type of unit jumps lead to wrong values of the area . to avoid this problem ,",
    "we can approximate the reparametrization by a continuous polygonal line rather than by discrete steps : @xmath138 the douglas functional can then be represented as @xmath139= \\pi r^2 \\lim_{n\\to\\infty } \\frac1{(n^2-n ) } \\sum_{i\\neq j } \\int \\limits_{\\tau_i}^{\\tau_{i+1 } } d\\tau_1   \\int \\limits_{\\tau_j}^{\\tau_{j+1 } } d\\tau_2 \\frac{\\sin^2[\\pi(\\sigma\\left(\\tau_1\\right)-\\sigma\\left(\\tau_2\\right))]}{\\sin^2[\\pi\\left(\\tau_1 - \\tau_2\\right)]}\\ , , \\label{douglasdiscrnew}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 and @xmath141 , @xmath142 are given by ( [ reparametrdiscrnew ] ) .",

    ". the simulations would be also very efficiently accelerated if these integrals could be taken analytically .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case for the circle .",

    "our main result is that the path integral over reparametrizations is tractable pretty much like the usual path integrals with the wiener measure , while the measure is different .",
    "the typical trajectories have , in general , discontinuities of the type of lvy s flights and zero hausdorff dimension , as distinct from the brownian trajectories whose hausdorff dimension is equal to two for the usual path integrals .    we have considered two types of the path integrals over reparametrizations : when the integrand equals one or is given by the exponential of the douglas integral for a circle .",
    "the former emerges in calculations  @xcite of qcd scattering amplitudes , while the latter is present in the effective string ansatz  @xcite for the asymptotically large wilson loops .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of typical trajectories for the latter is expected to decrease from one to zero with decreasing radius of the circle .",
    "our analysis of the path integral over reparametrizations is based on representing it as a ( subordinator ) stochastic process , whose probability density has an infinite variance which results in several subtleties ( like the central limit theorem or the law of large numbers are not applicable ) .",

    "the reason is that douglas theorem is no longer applicable in the discretized case and typical trajectories have jumps which decrease their hausdorff dimension .",
    "this no longer happens , when the discretization of reparametrizing functions is polygon - wise rather than step - wise .",
    "such a situation might be similar to the discretization of the fermionic action in lattice gauge theory , where a `` naively '' discretized action necessarily looses many properties of the continuum theory .",
    "a slow convergence of the average area to its asymptote may indicate that one should think of a completely different way to integrate over reparametrizations in the effective string ansatz .",
    "although our numerical simulations of the effective string ansatz are only for a circle , the method can be straightforwardly applied for other contours .",
    "it would be also interesting to apply numerical methods for evaluations of @xmath146 meson scattering amplitudes in the regge kinematical regime at finite quark mass , when a spin - dependent kernel is involved  @xcite , in particular , for extracting the value of the intercept of the quark - antiquark regge trajectory .",
