    "for example , it has been shown how a gravastar structure can form from a born - infeld scalar field such as that predicted by low energy string theory @xcite or supported from non - linear electrodynamics @xcite . in the multi - layer structure of the m - m model with de sitter core and asymptotical schwarzschild outside region , additional features have been added . in @xcite gravastar solutions",

    "more recently several papers have appeared discussing limits on gravastars and how to distinguish them from black holes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite that the gravastar configuration ( see the next section for the elaborated physical model of it ) has to have anisotropic pressures which in addition should obey some of the energy conditions of general relativity . in this context",
    "one would ideally construct such a spherically symmetric model of an anisotropic fluid with a corresponding equation of state .",
    "the model , by the definition of the gravastar , should not possess a horizon , it should to be stable and its ( anisotropic ) pressures and density ideally would not violate energy conditions .",
    "certainly this last requirement is somewhat relaxed in the sense that configurations constructed in this way will violate some of the ( usual ) energy conditions from its very initial definition .",
    "full reviews of gravastar models may be found in @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present solutions for the gravastar as proposed by cattoen , faber and visser ( cfv ) @xcite . in their paper",
    "an attractive sketch ( see fig.[fig:1 ] drawn here for the convenience of the reader ) is given as a guide to all the future gravastar model builders .",
    "in the next section a general description of gravastars as anisotropic fluid spheres is presented .        in section 3  we describe the evolution of the anisotropic gravastar model and one of the solutions ( model 1 ) which reproduces the cfv sketch of the anisotropic gravastar .",
    "the value of the surface redshift is calculated while a more elaborate analysis of this important quantity is relegated to a future work .",
    "section 4   is devoted to the solution ( model 2 ) which starts from the construction of an equation of state and consistently solving the remaining generalized tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation .",
    "stability of this solution with respect to axial perturbations is calculated .",
    "finally , we conclude with comments and possible extensions of the anisotropic gravastar solutions .",
    "einstein s field equations , being exceedingly complicated because of their nonlinear character , have one most important closed form solution outside a spherical star of total mass @xmath3 , namely the schwarzschild metric .",

    ", the interior metric may be written as @xmath10    the einstein equations , @xmath11 , give a system of equations :    @xmath12    these are supplemented with the conservation law @xmath13 , which in this case yields only one non - trivial equation : @xmath14 t^{1}_{\\;1 } -\\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda^{\\prime } t^{0}_{\\;0 } -\\frac{2}{r}t^{2}_{\\;2}=0\\;. \\label{eq : conslaw}\\ ] ]    elimination of the function @xmath15 from the above under - determined system leads to a convenient form of the conservation equation i.e. the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) @xcite , @xcite equation : @xmath16[m(r)+4\\pi p(r)r^3]}{r^2[1 - 2m(r)/r]}\\ ; , \\label{eq : tov}\\ ] ] with @xmath17 one may also specify an equation of state which relates pressure and density . if , for simplicity , we adopt at this stage a constant density profile function ( with built - in boundary conditions ) @xmath18    then it turns out to be an oversimplification which leads to analytic integration of ( [ eq : tov ] ) and the corresponding field equations but pressure and density do not obey the energy conditions which are analogous to the requirement of mass positivity in the newtonian mechanics .    with the isotropic fluid and the above homogeneous energy density static solutions are allowed for objects with a restricted total mass @xmath3 to radius @xmath19 ratio i.e. @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the idea of anisotropy in the spherically symmetric geometry was perhaps first introduced by g. lematre @xcite and suggested by einstein ( as quoted in ref .",
    "the limiting case of @xmath21 is mentioned there and the remaining transversal pressure was said to be enough to support a ( stable ) sphere ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "further development has brought different refinements of the original anisotropy notion ( see the papers @xcite - @xcite for studies and further references ) .",
    "the perfect fluid requires that the pressure in the interior of a star be isotropic , leading to calculations of isotropic polytropes for descriptions of objects like white dwarfs or neutron stars .",
    "another option giving more freedom to the equation of state within the spherical symmetry is the introduction of the stress - energy tensor which is anisotropic in its principal pressures .",
    "the anisotropy is sometimes ( spontaneously ) produced by extending the notion of a ( perfect ) fluid to phenomenological models including eg .",
    "scalar fields , or strongly interacting matter , although it is not known how large this anisotropy may be in realistic models .",
    "the stress - energy tensor for an anisotropic matter / fluid distribution is given by @xmath22 where @xmath0 is the radial pressure in the co - moving frame and ( again ) due to the spherical symmetry , the angular components are identified and are denoted as transversal pressures , @xmath1 . the vector @xmath23 is orthogonal to the fluid four - velocity ( @xmath24 ) .    in the gravastar model ,",
    "the core interior is assumed to be given by a de sitter solution so the appropriate pressure / density ratio value equal to minus one should be implemented as an initial condition for the density profile function , as well as a corrector to an equation of state connecting the pressure and density .    for the moment we assume constant energy density @xmath25 .",
    "in addition to the ( energy ) density in a prescribed form , a relation between the radial @xmath0 and the tangential @xmath1 pressures should be given .",
    "an ansatz for the anisotropy measure , @xmath26 will be used following the hints given in @xcite .",

    "does the radial pressure reach positive values before returning back into the negative pressure region .",
    "it is also worth noting that this simple model does not lead to an equation of state , since the energy density does not change within the star .",
    "as previously mentioned , this oversimplified model with the constant ( energy ) density function as given above can not reproduce the sketched figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "i.e. it can not provide a gravastar in the proposed model without the surface layer structure as required by junction conditions .",
    "the most obvious extension is to use perhaps the same ansatz for the equation of state connecting the behaviour of radial and tangential pressures as given in ( [ eq : mod1delta ] ) . for the density",
    "one takes some non - homogeneous distribution which will give a more complex dependence of @xmath33 and lead to a possible solution ( see the model 1 below ) .",
    "certainly the ansatz could be replaced by a calculated equation of state and introduce again an inhomogeneous density distribution ( see the model 2 below ) . on these two possibilities",
    "the new results of this paper are based .      in order to have a reasonably realistic radial pressure component we demand the ( most natural ) weak energy condition ( wec ) be satisfied everywhere :",
    "@xmath43 also , we require @xmath44 and , since stability of the fluid / gravastar requires that @xmath45 must not increase outwards , @xmath46    the above wec obviously implies : @xmath47 the so called null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "there is also a dominant energy condition ( dec ) which requires that @xmath48 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad p_t(r)\\in [ -\\rho(r),+\\rho(r ) ] , \\label{eq : dec}\\ ] ] and which implies the other two energy conditions .",
    "another commonly studied energy condition is the strong energy condition ( sec ) which states that , for our static system , @xmath49 since gravastars possess a desitter core , it is not possible to satisfy this energy condition .    within the normal range of the gravastar it could be reasonable to propose that the speed of sound shall not exceed 1 ( speed of light ) .",
    "this requirement is reasonable to apply in the region where one could expect that the unusual physics govern most of the physical processes ( i.e. where the matter possesses the least exotic behaviour ) . from the sketch in figure",
    "[ fig:1 ] this is expected to be in the gravastar atmosphere , so @xmath50    in this region one should be able to derive a polytropic equation of state which should be expressed by parameters which are in accordance to the requirement involving the speed of sound ( see next section ) .",
    "in this section the solution of the gravastar non - layered model ( i.e. the model sketched in figure [ fig:1 ] @xcite ) is sought by prescribing an equation of state relating the pressures .",
    "i.e. an equation which connects the radial @xmath33 and tangential @xmath51 pressure .",
    "an improved ansatz of the form @xmath52 is assumed , where @xmath53 is as given in ( [ eq : mod1delta ] ) .",
    "the ( inhomogeneous ) density function profiles will be chosen to be either of the exponential form or a polynomial form .",
    "the gravastar is a static configuration with a prescribed behaviour of the ( radial and tangential ) pressure .",
    "as sketched in figure [ fig:1 ] the radial ( and tangential ) pressure originates at @xmath54 with the initial value conforming with the de sitter interior definition @xmath55 .",
    "investigations concerning a possible analytic form of the ( energy ) density have produced stringent bounds on the allowed functional behaviour .    in the first approach to the gravastar model",
    "we start from the anisotropic tov equation . following the requirement imposed on the density profile we will be using a simply behaving function of the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 has an appropriate dimension and @xmath58",
    "is chosen to be a positive integer .",
    "motivations for the exponential form of @xmath7 may be found in @xcite , @xcite , where they chose @xmath59 , which simplifies some calculations .",
    "the values of the central density , @xmath60 , and of the fall - off constant , @xmath61 , may not be set arbitrarily , since one must make sure that the compactness does not exceed unity .",
    "alternatively , one may require a certain total mass of the configuration , and set the upper limit to the compactness within the star .",
    "then the values for the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 would follow . in this ( and the following ) model we will restrict our ( numerical ) procedures to a general total mass @xmath3 and @xmath61 by keeping the corresponding quantities as ratios .",
    "when requirements of anisotropy are being imposed we use the anisotropic fluid stress - energy tensor ( [ eq : anisotmunu ] ) @xmath62 . as",
    "before , we have from the equations ( [ eq : e1])-([eq : conslaw ] ) @xmath63 and the generalized tov equation @xmath64\\frac{m(r)+4\\pi p_r(r)r^3}{r^2[1 - 2m(r)/r ] } + 2\\frac{p_t(r)-p_r(r)}{r}\\\\ & = -[\\rho+p_r(r)]\\frac{m(r)+4\\pi p_r(r)r^3}{r^2[1 - 2m(r)/r ] } + 2\\rho(r)\\frac{\\tilde{\\delta } ( r)}{r } \\endaligned \\label{eq : anisotov}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the anisotropy parameter @xmath65 from above .    in figure",

    "by choosing another independent profile we will show that solutions found in this paper are not just artefacts of a very specifically chosen energy density profile but a more general feature of prescribed initial conditions within the framework of general relativity .      as the next example of the gravastar model construction we will use the density profile function of the form @xmath72;\\quad n\\geq 2 \\;,\\label{eq : polyrho}\\ ] ] and with the ansatz given in ( [ eq : mod1delta ] ) .",

    "apart from the energy condition relations among the components of @xmath84 , an equation of state for the matter described by @xmath85 should exist .",

    "<S> we study the gravitational vacuum star ( gravastar ) configuration as proposed by @xcite in a model where the interior de sitter spacetime segment is continuously extended to the exterior schwarzschild spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> the multilayered structure of @xcite - @xcite is replaced by a continuous stress - energy tensor at the price of introducing anisotropy in the ( fluid ) model of the gravastar . either with an ansatz for the equation of state connecting the radial @xmath0 and tangential @xmath1 pressure or with a calculated equation of state with non - homogeneous energy / fluid density , solutions are obtained which in all aspects satisfy the conditions expected for an anisotropic gravastar @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> certain energy conditions have been shown to be obeyed and a polytropic equation of state has been derived . </S>",
    "<S> stability of the solution with respect to possible axial perturbation is shown to hold .    </S>",
