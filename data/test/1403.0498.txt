    "in economics , finance , medical sciences , ecology , engineering , and many other branches of sciences , one often encounters problems which are influenced by event - driven uncertainties .",
    "for example , in finance , the unpredictable nature of important events such market crashes , announcements made by central banks , changes in credit ratings , defaults , etc . might have sudden and significant impacts on the stock price movements .",
    "stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) with jumps , or more precisely sdes driven by lvy noise , have been widely used to model such event - driven phenomena .",
    "the interested reader may refer , for example , to @xcite and references therein .",
    "many such sdes do not have explicit solutions and therefore one requires numerical schemes so as to approximate their solutions . over the past few years",
    ", several explicit and implicit schemes of sdes driven by lvy noise have been studied and results on their strong and weak convergence were proved . for a comprehensive discussion on these schemes , one could refer to @xcite , and references therein .",
    "it is also known , however , that the computationally efficient explicit euler schemes of sdes ( even without jumps ) may not convergence in strong ( @xmath0 ) sense when the drift coefficients are allowed to grow super - linearly , see for example @xcite .",
    "the development of tamed euler schemes was a recent breakthrough in order to address this problem ; one may consult @xcite as well as @xcite and references therein for a thorough investigation of the subject .    in this article",
    ", we propose explicit tamed euler schemes to numerically solve sdes with random coefficients driven by lvy noise .",
    "the taming techniques developed here allow one to approximate these sdes with drift coefficients that grow super - linearly . by adopting the approach of @xcite",
    ", we prove strong convergence in ( uniform ) @xmath0 sense of these tamed schemes by assuming one - sided local lipschitz condition on drift and local lipschitz conditions on both diffusion and jump coefficients .",
    "moreover , our technical calculations are more refined than those of @xcite in that we develop new techniques to overcome the challenges arising due to jumps .",
    "in addition , explicit formulations of the tamed euler schemes are presented at the end of section 3 for the case of sdes driven by lvy noise which have non - random coefficients .    to the best of the authors knowledge ,",
    "the results obtained in this article are the first for the case of super - linear coefficients in this area .",
    "moreover , the techniques developed here allow for further investigation of convergence properties of higher order explicit numerical schemes for sdes driven by lvy noise with super - linear coefficients .",
    "as an application of our approach which considers random coefficients , we also present in this article uniform @xmath0 convergence results of explicit tamed euler schemes for the case of stochastic delay differential equations ( sddes ) driven by lvy noise .",
    "the link between delay equations and random coefficients utilises ideas from @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned results are derived under the assumptions of one - sided local lipschitz condition on drift and local lipschitz conditions on both diffusion and jump coefficients with respect to non - delay variables , whereas these coefficients are only asked to be continuous with respect to arguments corresponding to delay variables .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that our approach allows one to use our schemes to approximate sddes with jumps when drift coefficients can have super - linear growth in both delay and non - delay arguments .",
    "thus , the proposed tamed euler schemes provide significant improvements over the existing results available on numerical techniques of sddes , for example , @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that , by adopting the approach of @xcite , we prove the existence of a unique solution to the sddes driven by lvy noise under more relaxed conditions than those existing in the literature , for example , @xcite whereby we ask for the local lipschitz continuity only with respect to the non - delay variables .    finally , rate of convergence results are obtained ( which are in agreement with classical literature ) when the local lipschitz continuity assumptions are replaced by global and , in addition ,",
    "the drift coefficients satisfy polynomial lipschitz continuity .",
    "similar results are also obtained for delay equations when the following assumptions hold - ( a ) drift coefficients satisfy one - sided lipschitz and polynomial lipschitz conditions in non - delay variables whereas polynomial lipschitz conditions in delay variables and ( b ) diffusion and jump coefficients satisfy lipschitz conditions in non - delay variables whereas polynomial lipschitz conditions in delay variables .",
    "this finding is itself a significant improvement over recent results in the area , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "we conclude this section by introducing some basic notation . for a vector @xmath1 , we write @xmath2 for its euclidean norm and for a @xmath3 matrix @xmath4 , we write @xmath5 for its hilbert - schmidt norm and @xmath6 for its transpose . also for @xmath7 , @xmath8 denotes the inner product of these two vectors .",

    "let @xmath13 be the predictable sigma - algebra on @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the sigma - algebra of borel sets of a topological space @xmath16 . also , let @xmath17 be fixed and @xmath18 denote the set of non - negative measurable functions @xmath19 on @xmath20 $ ] , such that @xmath21 .",
