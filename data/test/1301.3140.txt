    "lyman @xmath0 line emission is an increasingly important tool for identifying actively star forming galaxies in the distant universe .",
    "first proposed as a potential signpost for primitive galaxies @xcite , lyman-@xmath0  emission has now been used to identify thousands of galaxies at redshifts @xmath5 , along with smaller samples at @xmath6 and several candidates at @xmath7 .    while no galaxy yet identified by any means is demonstrably primordial , lyman-@xmath0  selected samples",
    "do have several properties suggestive of youth .",
    "their starlight is dominated by young populations with characteristically low stellar masses @xcite and small sizes @xcite . yet , the correlation properties of these objects suggest that they are associated with moderately large halos ( mass @xmath8 ; @xcite ) . combining these results",
    "suggests that a lyman-@xmath0  galaxy contains only a small fraction of the baryons that should be associated with its host dark matter halo",
    ". it would be interesting to know whether the `` missing '' baryons are present , either as old stellar populations , or in the interstellar medium of the lyman-@xmath0  galaxy .",
    "dynamical mass estimates for lyman-@xmath0  galaxies could potentially address this question , providing a standard for comparison with both the stellar masses and the dark halo masses .",
    "however , such dynamical mass estimates require an accurate measurement of the galaxy s velocity dispersion .",
    "the easiest approach to kinematics would be to use the lyman-@xmath0  line width , which is measured for most spectroscopically confirmed lyman-@xmath0  galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , this does not lead to useful velocity dispersion information : the lyman-@xmath0  line profile can be dramatically affected by the interplay of resonant scattering and gas kinematics in the emitting galaxy .",
    "we therefore turn in this paper to studying lyman-@xmath0  galaxy kinematics using the strong rest - frame optical emission lines of [ oiii ] @xmath9  and h@xmath0 @xmath10 .",
    "we build on the first detections of such lines in lyman-@xmath0  selected galaxies at redshifts @xmath11 @xcite . in section  [ sec : samp_dat ] , we describe the sample and the key data . in section  [ sec : dynmass1 ] we estimate dynamical masses based on the observed line widths . in section  [ sec : popsynth ] , we analyze the stellar populations and dust reddening in these galaxies , using deep archival photometry . in section  [ sec : tf ] , we combine the rest - optical line width measurements with the stellar masses from population synthesis modelling to compare these lyman-@xmath0  galaxies with expectations from the stellar mass tully - fisher relation . in section",
    "[ sec : sfr_scale ] , we examine the relation between gas mass surface density and star formation surface density to show lyman-@xmath0  galaxies lie on the same sequence as starburst galaxies .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : density ] , we explore the mass densities of the sample and the implications for the future evolution of lyman-@xmath0  galaxies .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath12-cdm `` concordance cosmology '' with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "our sample consists of lyman-@xmath0  emitting galaxies that were selected from four surveys .",
    "all are selected directly by the presence of a strong lyman-@xmath0  emission line in the survey data .",
    "for the analysis in this paper , we make use of ( a ) velocity dispersions @xmath16 , derived from spectra of rest frame optical emission lines ; ( b ) sizes , as measured by the half - light radius @xmath17 in broad - band optical hubble space telescope images ; ( c ) stellar masses and dust extinctions , derived from spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fits ; and ( d ) star formation rates ( sfr ) , determined from h@xmath0 line flux measurements where available ( and from spectral energy distribution fitting otherwise ) , and corrected for dust using the results of the sed fits . in this section",
    "we summarize the sources for various galaxies in the sample , along with the measurements of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and sfr .",
    "the stellar mass derivations are discussed later , in section  [ sec : popsynth ] .",
    "the properties of the sample are also summarized in tables 13 .",
    "first , we select two lyman-@xmath0  galaxies from a 5020  narrowband survey using the steward observatory s 90 inch bok telescope on kitt peak , arizona",
    ". the objects we study here were spectroscopically confirmed as lyman-@xmath0  emitters at @xmath19 using the 6.5 m mmt on mt .",
    "hopkins , arizona .",
    "this survey was introduced in @xcite , and further details will be presented in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "we have followed up galaxies from this sample with three near - infrared spectrographs : lucifer , on the large binocular telescope @xcite ; nifs , on gemini north @xcite ; and nirspec , on the keck ii telescope @xcite .",
    "the objects studied here are lae40844 and lae27878 ( following the numbering in @xcite ) .",
    "the primary source of line widths for these objects is our gemini nifs data @xcite , since our keck observations of 40844 were primarily aimed at the ( still undetected )  lines , while the kinematic line width is not well resolved in the lucifer observations .",
    "these gemini observations yielded line widths of @xmath20  for object 40844 and 8.6  for object 27878 . the instrumental resolution was about 5 . subtracting this instrumental resolution in quadrature from the measured line widths yields 13.0and 7.0  respectively .",
    "the corresponding line - of - sight velocity dispersions become @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "the half - light radii for these objects are 1.1 kpc for lae40844 and 1.3 kpc for lae27878 @xcite .",
    "we estimated their star formation rates from sed fitting ( section  [ sec : popsynth ] ) , since their h@xmath0 line falls at @xmath23 and can not be easily observed .",
    "we obtained @xmath24 for lae40844 , and @xmath25 for lae27878 .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties in these star formation rates from the range of sfr in models yielding acceptable fits to the data ( see section  [ sec : popsynth ] ) .",
    "second , we use two lyman-@xmath0  galaxies selected using a blind spectroscopic search with an integral field spectrograph as part of the hetdex pilot survey . these are objects hps194 ( @xmath26 ) and hps256 ( @xmath27 ) . for these",
    ", we base our kinematic line widths on keck+nirspec h@xmath0 line measurements from @xcite .",
    "these used low - resolution mode with the nspec-7 blocking filter .",
    "the measured line widths were @xmath28  ( fwhm ) for hps 194 , and @xmath29  ( fwhm ) for hps 256 .",
    "the instrumental resolving power is @xmath30 with the @xmath31 slit , corresponding to 1415   fwhm , and direct measurements of sky lines in the two spectra yield resolutions of @xmath32  and @xmath33  ( fwhm ) respectively . subtracting these in quadrature yields line widths of @xmath34  and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding line - of - sight velocity dispersions become @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "the half - light radii , as reported in the cosmos acs i - band catalog @xcite , are @xmath38 for hps194 , and @xmath39 for hps256 .",
    "( hps 194 in fact corresponds to a pair of continuum sources separated by @xmath40 in the cosmos survey s hst+acs images .",
    "we assume that the strong lyman-@xmath0  and h@xmath0 emission come from the brighter and more compact source .",
    "the other source has a @xmath41 half - light radius , which would raise our dynamical mass for this object by about 60% . )",
    "the h@xmath0 line fluxes @xcite yield star formation rates of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , before dust correction .",
    "this is based on the conversion @xmath44 , which is appropriate for a chabrier ( 2003 ) initial mass function [ imf ] @xcite .",
    "the inferred sfr would be @xmath45 greater for a kroupa ( 2003 ) imf , and @xmath46 greater for the imf assumed in kennicutt ( 1998 ) .",
    "we correct these star formation rates for dust extinction within the emitting galaxy .",
    "the uncertainty in the star formation rate is dominated by the uncertainty in this dust correction , which we estimate by considering the full range of extinction among models with @xmath47 , and further allowing the possibility that the extinction of h@xmath0 could exceed the extinction of continuum starlight by up to a factor of 2 .",
    "third , we use four lyman-@xmath0  galaxies from a narrowband survey described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these objects are drawn from two fields cosmos ( objects cosmos13636 and cosmos30679 ) and the chandra deep field south ( objects cdfs3865 and cdfs6482 ) .",
    "we obtained line widths for all sources by measuring the plotted fwhm of emission line profiles in figures  1 , 2 , and 5 of @xcite .",
    "in general , the lines in this sample appear marginally resolved . in our analysis",
    "we regard the line width measurements as upper limits where appropriate .",
    "the cosmos field spectra were from keck + nirspec spectroscopy .",
    "here we obtained directly measured fwhm of @xmath48 and @xmath49  for cosmos13636 and cosmos30679 , respectively . with a resolving power of @xmath50 , the instrumental resolution corresponds to @xmath51 , which we subtract in quadrature to yield nominal velocity dispersions @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively . in each case , the measurement remains consistent with a fairly broad range , @xmath54 .    for these cosmos field sources , we base the half light radii on the cosmos acs i - band catalog , obtaining @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "finally , their star formation rates as inferred from their h@xmath0 fluxes are @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "the cdfs field source spectra @xcite were obtained with magellan + mmirs , and have a somewhat lower resolving power ( @xmath59 , corresponding to 18 ) .",
    "the measured fwhm are 23  for cdfs3865 and 20  for cdfs6482 . subtracting the instrumental resolution in quadrature yields velocity dispersions of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , where again there is considerable uncertainty for the narrower , semi - resolved line ( consistent with @xmath62 ) .",
    "the star formation rates for these sources , based on their h@xmath0 line fluxes , are @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .    for the physical sizes of the cdfs sources , we downloaded archival hst imaging from the gems survey @xcite and measured the half light radii .",
    "we used the sextractor @xcite half light radius , and as a consistency check also measured the fluxes in a series of circular apertures and interpolated the resulting photometric growth curve .",
    "both methods gave consistent answers , with half light radii of @xmath65 for cdfs3865 , and @xmath66 for cdfs6482 .",
    "finally , we use one lyman-@xmath0  galaxy , lae - cosmos-47 , from a narrowband - selected @xmath67 cosmos field sample obtained by @xcite using the eso 2.2 m telescope , with followup observations obtained by fynbo and collaborators using the x - shooter spectrograph @xcite on the vlt . the x - shooter spectrum provided a well constrained velocity dispersion measurement of @xmath68 .",
    "the star formation rate , derived from the h@xmath0 line flux , is @xmath69 . the half - light radius , from the cosmos acs catalog @xcite , is @xmath70 .",
    "the measured velocity dispersions @xmath16 from the rest - optical emission lines are a good estimate of the total luminosity - weighted kinematics of the gas .",
    "the galaxies we are studying are spatially unresolved even in @xmath40 seeing , meaning that the ground - based spectra we use effectively sample the integrated light , with no important dependence on slit width .",
    "the precise conversion from velocity width to mass will depend on the kinematic structure of these galaxies . for a pure rotation - supported model with a flat rotation curve , we expect @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the inclination angle of the disk ( with @xmath73 corresponding to an edge - on system ) .    the simplest dynamical mass estimate from these measurements , which is a lower bound to the true gravitating mass , is @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the maximum radius at which we observe light from the galaxy .",
    "a more practical choice of radius is the effective radius @xmath17 , defined as the radius that encloses half of the galaxy s light in projection . if we presume that the half - light radius is also the half - mass radius , our revised estimate of the dynamical mass becomes @xmath76 .",
    "the resulting mass estimates range from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , and are summarized in table  [ tab : masses ] .",
    "several circumstances could affect our estimated mass .",
    "a rotating disk with @xmath77 would reduce the measured @xmath16 ( relative to the edge - on case ) .",
    "also , in our spatially unresolved spectroscopy , the observed @xmath78 reflects the luminosity - weighted average kinematics .",
    "if a significant fraction of the galaxy s light is emitted from regions where the local circular speed @xmath79 is below the maximum circular speed ( @xmath80 ) , we should expect the weighted average @xmath78 to underestimate @xmath80 and hence the mass .",
    "the precise magnitude of this effect depends on the galaxy s light profile and rotation curve .",
    "also , like any dynamical mass based on luminous tracers , our estimate is insensitive to mass located outside the luminous matter distribution of the galaxies .",
    "if the galaxies are embedded in extended dark matter halos , the total mass of the halo could be many times the mass estimates derived from the observed @xmath17 and @xmath78 .",
    "turbulence in the galaxy s gas would contribute to the measured @xmath16 , though in virial equilibrium , that turbulence would constitute a source of pressure support and the ordered rotation of the galaxy would be correspondingly reduced .",
    "most interestingly , if the galaxy is not in equilibrium at all , our assumed relations between kinematics and mass could be substantially wrong .",
    "our mass estimate implicitly assumes that the virial theorem is fulfilled , that is , that the kinetic energy @xmath81 and potential energy @xmath82 of the galaxy are related by @xmath83 .",
    "on the other hand , in a cold accretion scenario , new material falling into a galaxy for the first time should have @xmath84 , i.e. , the motions are faster for the same gravitating mass under these conditions , and the mass inferred from gas motions would be correspondingly over - estimated by a factor up to @xmath85 .    given these uncertainties , it is best to regard our direct dynamical mass estimates as approximate numbers , good to a factor of perhaps 2 when regarded as lower bounds to the true dynamical mass .",
    "other dynamical mass estimates in the literature consider a more general scaling coefficient so that @xmath86 ( see @xcite and references therein , esp . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these works favor @xmath87 for early - type galaxies with sersic index @xmath88 , and find that despite theoretical expectations for some increase of @xmath89 with decreasing sersic @xmath90 , the observational evidence favors @xmath91 for a wide range of @xmath90 .",
    "thus , the simple arguments that led us to use @xmath92 likely come fairly close to the correct dynamical masses .",
    "a complementary approach to interpreting the kinematic data on these galaxies is to use their linewidths to place them on some form of the tully - fisher relation , and so to compare them on an equal footing to other galaxy populations .",
    "such an approch avoids the difficulties associated with identifying the right radius to use in estimators of the form @xmath93 . for high redshift galaxy populations ,",
    "a small scatter with weak redshift evolution has been demonstrated for the stellar mass tully - fisher relation , and we place our galaxies on such a relation in section  [ sec : tf ] below . to do so ,",
    "we first need their stellar masses .",
    "all of the galaxies we study have extensive multiband photometry in the literature , generally including multiband optical data , some deep ground - based near - infrared photometry , and spitzer irac @xcite observations that are deep enough to be constraining in at least the 3.6@xmath94 channel .",
    "we have used these data to derive stellar mass estimates for the full sample .",
    "stellar mass estimates are also available in the published literature for many of these galaxies @xcite .",
    "while these are mostly consistent with our estimates where samples overlap , we opted to fit the entire sample using a single procedure to avoid potential difficulties comparing masses derived using different methodologies .",
    "\\(1 ) the strong lyman-@xmath0  emission in these objects requires the presence of a young stellar population , whose ultraviolet light ionizes interstellar hydrogen that then recombines to produce the observed lyman-@xmath0  radiation .",
    "( 2 ) the amount of dust in the fitting is essentially determined by the uv spectral slope ( cf .",
    "( 3 ) in some objects , no stars older than @xmath95 years are _ required _ to explain the observed light .",
    "( 4 ) a considerable mass in old stars is _ permitted .",
    "_ ( 5 ) the ionizing photon production for the best - fit stellar populations can be converted to a lyman-@xmath0  luminosity by assuming that @xmath96 of the ionizing photons are ultimately converted to lyman-@xmath0 radiation ( as expected under case b recombination with a negligible escape fraction for ionizing photons ) . combining this line luminosity estimate with the directly measured lyman-@xmath0",
    "line flux gives an estimate of the escape fraction for the lyman-@xmath0  photons .",
    "these escape fractions are sensitive to the details of the star formation history over the last @xmath97 myr .",
    "we can say with reasonable confidence that the resulting escape fraction is of order half for the most plausible models , and that lyman-@xmath0  escape fractions below 2030% are ruled out unless we change the stellar population in some way that dramatically increases the ionizing photon production .",
    "( 6 ) the estimated stellar population ages and masses would increase dramatically if we did not account for the  line fluxes . in this case , the stellar population fitting code attempts to interpret the red h@xmath98k color and the bright flux in the rest - frame 5000  range as due to older stellar populations .",
    "this effect can exceed an order of magnitude in both age and mass when the filter containing the   lines is the reddest filter considered , while it is usually smaller when an additional filter redward of the 4000  break is included ( meaning , in our case , the irac photometry ) .",
    "we measured stellar masses for our sample using the starburst99 population synthesis code @xcite . for each galaxy",
    "we started with publically available broad band photometry .",
    "for the seven objects in the cosmos field , we used cosmos project broad band photometry @xcite , either directly from the cosmos archive , or as quoted in the papers defining the samples @xcite .",
    "for the two cdfs objects , we used musyc survey photometry @xcite ( again as quoted in @xcite ) . in all cases ,",
    "our final model fitting used at least 9 photometric bands spanning at least the wavelength range @xmath99 .    to interpret the photometry in terms of stellar population parameters",
    ", we first ran starburst99 to generate a grid of model spectra for stellar populations at a range of ages , from @xmath100 years ( which is so young that no star has yet left the main sequence ) , up to @xmath101 years ( which is the age of the universe at @xmath102 ) , and using a kroupa ( 2003 ) imf .",
    "we then assumed a star formation history ( as described below ) and generated a model spectrum by a linear combination of the spectra for particular age steps from the starburst99 output .",
    "we account for the mean opacity of the intergalactic medium using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "we do not treat the variance in the igm opacity in the present work .",
    "( doing so would effectively add uncertainty to the expected fluxes in the @xmath103 , b@xmath104 , and @xmath105 bands , and so would improve the model @xmath106 , but would not likely change the best fit model parameters much . )",
    "we model dust in our sample galaxies using the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) extinction law from @xcite , and treating the extinction as a thin screen .",
    "the smc law is a reasonable choice since its metallicity corresponds approximately to the few metallicity constraints so far available for lyman-@xmath0  emitters @xcite .",
    "we next added the directly measured spectroscopic line fluxes to the model spectrum at the appropriate wavelengths , since these emission lines are not included in the model output .",
    "this step follows the application of igm and dust opacity , since nature has already applied these effects to the observed line fluxes .    at this point",
    ", we have a full model spectrum accounting for stellar populations , emission lines , dust , and intergalactic hydrogen absorption .",
    "we multiply this spectrum by the bandpass of each filter in the photometric data set , integrate , and normalize appropriately to obtain model fluxes in each observed filter for the model under consideration .",
    "these can be compared to the observed data to obtain a goodness - of - fit parameter @xmath107 .    to optimize the model",
    ", we fitted the observed spectral energy distribution of the sample galaxies by a simple monte carlo approach that randomly varies the amount of dust and the mass in stars in each of 13 logarithmically spaced age bins , and accepts a change to the model parameters using @xmath106 minimization .",
    "this approach allows a more general star formation history than a single burst or an exponentially decaying star formation rate . while the resulting sampling of stellar ages is somewhat coarse compared to a typical single burst model , the associated uncertainty is not a dominant factor in our stellar mass estimates .",
    "the model fits usually converge to a case where 13 of the 13 mass bins dominate the luminosity at all observed wavebands .",
    "we therefore `` trim '' the parameter list by fixing the stellar mass to zero in bins that are clearly of minor importance , and rerun the fit with only the important mass bins .",
    "this `` trimming '' step generally has a negligible effect on the final @xmath106 , confirming that 13 simple stellar populations can explain the observed spectrum as well as a more complex star formation history .    to further explore the parameter space of acceptable fits",
    ", we modified our code to optimize for either minima or maxima of either stellar mass or dust extinction , subject to the constraint that the model @xmath106 remain close to the @xmath106 of the best fitting model for each object .",
    "we explored models with @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "this corresponds approximately to the @xmath110 and @xmath111 error regions in the parameter space .",
    "the stellar mass tully - fisher ( smtf ) relation is a correlation between the kinematic line widths of galaxies and their stellar masses .",
    "the smtf relation is more robust to differences in stellar population mass - to - light ratio than the original tully - fisher relation ( which correlates luminosity with line width ; @xcite ) .",
    "the relation is further generalized by @xcite , who demonstrated that replacing the circular speed @xmath112 with the kinematic estimator @xmath113 results in an smtf that is both tighter and more applicable to the wide range of galaxy properties seen at high redshift .",
    "@xmath114 has an additional advantage : for spatially unresolved galaxies ( like those we study here ) , @xmath114 can be measured reasonably accurately regardless of whether the width is dominated by ordered rotation or by random motions .",
    "our actual measurement is a single number , the line width , characterized by the observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath115 .",
    "we then use @xmath116 for our galaxies . consider pure circular motion with a flat rotation curve of velocity @xmath117 , viewed edge - on : we will find @xmath118 , so that @xmath116 . if instead the motion is entirely random , with @xmath119 , we expect @xmath120 , and again , @xmath121 . only for",
    "ordered rotation in a face - on configuration do we expect @xmath115 to be a significant under - estimate of @xmath114 . while we can not rule out this possiblity with our data ,",
    "it is likely that these galaxies are dynamically hot ( @xmath122 ) , since the stellar populations dominating the observed light are at most @xmath123 dynamical time old .",
    "our results are shown in figure  [ fig : smtf ] , both for stellar masses from sed fitting and for dynamical masses from line width and spatial extent .",
    "the error bars for the stellar masses show the ranges of stellar mass permitted by models with @xmath124 , and with @xmath125 .",
    "the error bars for dynamical mass are determined by the uncertainties in @xmath16 , and are diagonal since the x - axis of the plot _ is _ @xmath16 . for three objects from the @xcite sample , @xmath16 and @xmath126",
    "are plotted as upper bounds .",
    "comparing our lyman-@xmath0  sample to the stellar mass tully - fisher relation that @xcite reported for @xmath127 star - forming galaxies , we find that both the stellar masses and dynamical masses of laes generally follow the established relation .",
    "dynamical mass estimates show less scatter than stellar masses , as might be expected given the vagaries of star formation histories .    about half the galaxies are consistent with stellar masses falling a factor of two or more below their dynamical masses , when we account for the range of acceptable estimates for both . for these galaxies , it is possible that the dynamical mass within the central 12 kpc is dominated not by the young stars that power the observed lyman-@xmath0  emission , but by some other unseen component .",
    "collisionless dark matter should not be so strongly concentrated in the central kpc of a dark matter halo .",
    "old stars ( formed from centrally concentrated gas @xmath128 years ago ) are a possible alternative .",
    "the dynamical mass estimates we present are in fact a tighter limit on the total mass in old stars within the inner @xmath129 than are the photometric limits . given the actively star - forming nature of these lyman-@xmath0  emitting galaxies , a reservoir of gas is the most intriguing possibility for the `` excess '' dynamical mass .",
    "overall , though , such excess mass is merely permitted and not required by the data so , overall , the lyman-@xmath0  galaxy sample shows consistency with the stellar mass tully - fisher relation for other samples .",
    "whatever physical properties allow lyman-@xmath0  to escape these particular star forming galaxies , they do not strongly affect the mass - linewidth relation .",
    "the tight correlation observed between @xmath126 and line width is related to the small and nearly constant physical sizes of the lyman-@xmath0  galaxy sample @xcite .",
    "a fixed physical size , combined with variable ( and sometimes uncertain ) line widths , can generate the observed slope of the @xmath126 - @xmath114 relation .",
    "the @xmath130 - @xmath114 relation from @xcite has a somewhat steeper slope . presuming that stars form a fairly large and fairly constant fraction of the dynamical mass , this slope could be interpreted as evidence for size - linewidth relation in the @xcite sample , with @xmath131 for @xmath132 .",
    "we now take the dynamical mass as an upper bound on the gas mass in these galaxies , and compare their properties to the scaling relations that describe star formation in other galaxy classes .",
    "we use the gas surface mass density limit @xmath133 .",
    "we can improve this bound by subtracting our stellar mass estimates . in practice , our _ maximum _ stellar mass always exceeds the dynamical mass , allowing the possiblity that there is no gas mass . in most cases ,",
    "though , our _ minimum _ stellar masses are below the dynamical masses , and we can subtract them to yield refined estimates of the gas mass surface density ( @xmath134 ) .    the star formation rate and gas surface density can be related according to scaling laws of the form @xmath135 ( where @xmath136 is in @xmath137 , and @xmath138 is in @xmath139 ) . for nearby spirals , and for distant star - forming bzk galaxies ,",
    "@xcite find @xmath140 and @xmath141 for our choice of units . for submillimeter galaxies and ( u)lirgs , daddi et al find a parallel but offset `` starburst '' sequence , with @xmath142 ( corresponding to @xmath143 more star formation for the same gas surface density ) .",
    "we determined @xmath136 for our sample using the sfr estimates and half - light radius measurements discussed in [ sec : samp_dat ] .",
    "we have selected a chabrier imf for consistency with @xcite .",
    "these values of @xmath136 exceed the expectations for `` normal '' star forming galaxies by a median factor of 4 , based on @xmath144 alone ( i.e. assuming that _ all _ the gravitating mass is gas ) .",
    "the disagreement is significant at the @xmath145 level , relative to the 0.33 dex scatter in the scaling relation reported by @xcite .",
    "a factor of 4 would place the lyman-@xmath0  galaxies in between the normal and starburst sequences , though closer to the starburst sequence .",
    "if we use @xmath146 in the scaling relations , we find that the median galaxy in our sample is forming stars at _ twice _ the rate expected even under the starburst scaling .",
    "the bottom line from this comparison is that lyman-@xmath0  galaxies likely belong to a family of starbursting objects that includes ulirgs and submillimeter galaxies , despite order - of - magnitude differences in mass and star formation rates .    while the `` normal '' and starburst",
    "galaxies follow distinct @xmath136 - @xmath147 relations , they obey a single relation when @xmath138 is replaced with the quantity @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the dynamical time .",
    "we use @xmath150 to place our lyman-@xmath0  galaxy sample on this relation also . while the lyman-@xmath0  galaxies appear",
    "_ less _ unusual when measured against this relation , they remain systematically above the trend line found by @xcite .",
    "the difference is suggestive , rather than significant , being a @xmath111 effect .",
    "the median offset is a factor of @xmath151 in @xmath136 at fixed @xmath148 .",
    "this is comparable to the @xmath152 scatter in the relation as reported by @xcite ) .",
    "this possible deviation should be explored using a larger sample .",
    "the range of gas surface densities plotted in figure  [ fig : sfr_law ] is from @xmath153 to @xmath154 .",
    "based on a standard ratio of dust to gas column density , @xmath155 @xcite , this corresponds to @xmath156@xmath157 magnitudes of extinction . yet ,",
    "our sed fits suggest modest extinctions , @xmath158 , in all cases .",
    "there are a few possible explanations .",
    "first , the gas surface density could be much lower than one would expect for the observed level of star formation activity . in this case",
    ", the star formation vs. gas surface density scaling must be more extreme than even the starburst relation .",
    "second , the dust - to - gas ratio could be about 12 orders of magnitude lower than in the milky way .",
    "this would be most easily accommodated if the dust - to - gas ratio scales as the square of metal abundance .",
    "third , the extinctions inferred from sed fitting could be dramatic under - estimates .",
    "if so , these objects bolometric luminosity would mostly emerge in the rest - frame far infrared , making them readily detectible with submillimeter imaging ( cf .",
    "given our estimates of the dynamical mass , it is straightforward to determine the mean density within the effective radius for our sample .",
    "we find @xmath159 where we have used @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "hierarchical structure formation models suggest that most collapsed galaxies at @xmath162 should be incorporated into early - type galaxies or disk galaxy bulges by the present epoch .",
    "we therefore compare the density measurements for lyman-@xmath0  galaxies to corresponding densities for early - type galaxies and bulges in figure  [ fig : dense ] .",
    "the lyman-@xmath0  galaxy densities are the mean density within the effective radius , derived dynamically and therefore inclusive of all gravitating mass . for disk galaxy bulges , we take an intermediate - redshift sample from @xcite . here",
    "we use the published effective radii and velocity dispersions to obtain dynamical estimates of density .",
    "we use two nearby elliptical galaxy samples ( one from @xcite , and one compiled by @xcite from earlier work by @xcite ) . for the @xcite sample , we determine densities from published @xmath16 and @xmath17 measurements ; while for the @xcite sample , we use plotted values of @xmath17 and @xmath163 .",
    "the lyman-@xmath0galaxies are smaller at fixed density , and less dense at fixed radius , than are the nearby ellipticals and spiral bulges .",
    "on the other hand they tend to be smaller and denser than the handful of local ellipticals that have similar dynamical masses .",
    "we also compare to a sample of early type galaxies at @xmath164 @xcite , which overlaps our lyman-@xmath0  sample in redshift . here , the lyman-@xmath0  galaxies are of considerably lower density . in the samples from @xcite",
    ", we are using _",
    "stellar _ mass rather than dynamical mass , since @xmath16 is generally unavailable for the high - redshift early type galaxies .",
    "were dynamical masses available , we might expect these two samples to shift upwards in figure  [ fig : dense ] , but the effect would be modest , since the central regions of early type galaxies are likely dominated by mass in stars .",
    "the relation between initial overdensity and epoch of collapse ensures that bound galaxies at @xmath165 will , by the present epoch , be parts of more massive structures .",
    "we expect that the lyman-@xmath0  galaxies we observe will grow through some combination of merging and smooth accretion .",
    "merging can proceed either without dissipation , as expected for pure mergers of stellar systems ( `` dry mergers '' ) ; or with dissipation , as generally expected for gas - rich objects .",
    "conservation of energy and the virial theorem can be combined to infer the expected evolution of radius with mass for dry mergers , both in the limit of equal - mass ( `` major '' ) mergers , and in the limit of large mass ratio ( `` minor '' ) mergers . for major mergers ,",
    "we expect @xmath166 , while for minor , we expect @xmath167 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : dense ] , these correspond to @xmath168 for major mergers , and @xmath169 for minor .",
    "we plot vectors for both scalings .",
    "these show that the lyman-@xmath0  galaxies we observe can not grow to reproduce the observed masses , sizes , and densities of modern elliptical galaxies through simple dry merging . instead , dissipational",
    "( `` wet '' ) merging is required , in order to grow the galaxies at approximately constant mass density .",
    "we have performed the first study of dynamical masses for high redshift lyman-@xmath0  galaxies , using a sample of nine objects assembled from four samples @xcite .",
    "such studies have been previously impractical , given small sizes that require hst imaging for size measurements @xcite , faint continuum that precludes absorption line measurements , and redshifts that require near - infrared spectroscopy to access those emission lines most useful for kinematic line width measurements .",
    "we measure dynamical masses ranging from @xmath170 to @xmath171 .",
    "we combine these dynamical masses with stellar masses , to study the position of lyman-@xmath0  galaxies on a version of the stellar mass tully - fisher relation between mass and line width . to derive stellar masses consistently for the full sample",
    ", we fitted population models to extensive multiband photometry covering rest wavelengths from lyman-@xmath0to beyond the 4000  break .",
    "this affords constraints on young stars , older stars , and dust .",
    "we find that the lyman-@xmath0  galaxies are broadly consistent with the stellar mass tully - fisher relation established at lower redshift .",
    "thus , whatever physical conditions allow the production and escape of significant lyman-@xmath0 , they do not result in strong departures from the linewidth - mass relation .",
    "on the other hand , about half the sample galaxies are consistent with stellar masses significantly below their dynamical masses . in these cases",
    ", there is a possibility of a dynamically significant reservoir of gas that is present in the inner kpc region and provides fuel for ongoing star formation .",
    "the dynamical mass measurements are in fact the most powerful constraint we have on the presence of old stars in the sample galaxies . in most cases ,",
    "the stellar population fits allow up to @xmath172 of old stars before the resulting light appreciably degrades the quality of the sed fit .",
    "however , dynamical constraints place a tighter limit of @xmath173 on the total mass for the galaxies in our sample .    by using the dynamical masses as an upper bound on the gas mass , and using the h@xmath0 line measurements and/or stellar population fits to infer star formation rates , we have examined the way the lyman-@xmath0galaxies fall on the scaling relations for star formation .",
    "we conclude that they form stars more actively than the `` normal '' star forming galaxy population at comparable gas mass surface density .",
    "their behavior is consistent with that observed in starburst galaxies , despite the typically smaller masses and sizes of the lyman-@xmath0  galaxy population .",
    "the dynamical masses we infer remain 12 orders of magnitude below the characteristic dark halo masses inferred from the clustering of lyman-@xmath0  galaxies .",
    "since the ratio of baryonic to dark mass should be globally uniform at around 14% , we infer that a significant part of the baryonic matter associated with these halos has not yet accreted to the central , where the active star formation is observed .    finally , we examined densities of these objects . while hierarchical structure formation models suggest that small galaxies at @xmath1743 should become parts of early type galaxies or spiral bulges by @xmath175 , the lyman-@xmath0  galaxies are of smaller size and comparable density to present day elliptical galaxies , and of comparable size but smaller density than present day spiral galaxy bulges .",
    "if the lyman-@xmath0  galaxies are to evolve into either , they must do so through dissipational merging .",
    "this is consistent with the picture of lyman-@xmath0  galaxies as young , starbursting galaxies , whose present properties and future evolution include a large role for gas physics .",
