    "completely absorbing light within a layer of deeply sub - wavelength thickness , with zero reflection and zero transmission , is a challenge of both fundamental theoretical interest and of importance for practical applications such as photodetectors @xcite , optical switches , modulators and transducers @xcite .",
    "total light absorption ( tla ) can be achieved in two ways : by adiabatically introducing a complex refractive index change over the space of many wavelengths ; or by creating a critically coupled resonance . while the first approach exhibits tla across a broad bandwidth , it is inconsistent with the use of thin films @xcite .",
    "the critical coupling condition required for resonant perfect absorption is typically satisfied over a modest bandwidth , but may be achieved in structures of subwavelength thickness .",
    "resonant perfect absorbers typically couple light into either a longitudinal standing wave in a homogeneous ( or homogenised metamaterials ) layer , as in fig .  [ schematic](a ) @xcite , or a sideways propagating surface plasmon polariton ( spp ) on the surface of a corrugated metal , as in fig .",
    "[ schematic](b ) @xcite .",
    "tla has also been demonstrated using plasmonic nanocomposites @xcite and plasmonic metasurfaces @xcite , however plasmons are only excited by transverse magnetically ( tm ) polarized light .",
    "the very strong absorption of unpolarized light has been achieved using crossed or bi - periodic metallic gratings @xcite , and arrays of single layer doped graphene nano - disks @xcite .",
    "the fabrication of metamaterial and nanoplasmonic structures is challenging because their minimum feature sizes are on the order of tens of nanometers at infrared and visible wavelengths .",
    "the use of metals also makes them incompatible with optoelectonic applications where a photocurrent must be extracted .",
    "here we experimentally demonstrate the total absorption of light in lamellar gratings of deeply subwavelength thickness and provide a comprehensive theoretical treatment of the phenomenon using the emustack package @xcite for numerical simulations .",
    "figures  [ schematic](c ) and [ schematic](d ) show our theoretical and experimental configurations respectively . in our experiments",
    "we show that transverse electrically ( te ) polarized light , where the e - field is along the grating rulings ( @xmath4-axis in fig .  [ schematic ] ) , is totally absorbed in gratings composed of _ relatively weakly - absorbing semiconductors _ that have a complex refractive index , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 .",
    "such materials are abundant in nature and are compatible with optoelectronic applications .",
    "furthermore , our structures have minimum feature sizes close to 100  nm even when targeting visible wavelengths , and can be patterned using standard techniques .",
    "we also show numerically that tm polarized light ( h - field along @xmath4-axis ) can be totally absorbed in ultra - thin gratings , and that this requires metallic materials with @xmath7 ( re@xmath8 ) , because it relies on the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) .    the paper is organized as follows : we begin by reviewing the fundamental limits to absorption in ultra - thin structure ; in sect .  [ deri ] we derive the conditions for tla in uniform layers ; in sect .  [ gratings ] we investigate absorption in gratings showing that tla occurs at very different refractive indices than in uniform layers ; in sect .",
    "[ exp ] we demonstrate tla experimentally in weakly absorbing semiconductor gratings illuminated from one side ; in sect .  [ general ]",
    "we show theoretically that tla in ultra - thin gratings can be achieved using a very wide range of materials ; and we conclude in sect .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "before investigating tla in ultra - thin gratings we briefly examine tla in homogeneous ultra - thin films .",
    "an ultra - thin structure ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the layers thickness ) can absorb at most 50% of the incident power when surrounded symmetrically by uniform media ( refractive index @xmath11 ) and illuminated from one side @xcite .",
    "this limit arises because the incident energy is equipartitioned between the two longitudinal modes of these structures : one has an even electric field symmetry ( anti - node in the centre of the layer as in fig .",
    "[ schematic2](a)(i ) ) ; the other has an odd symmetry ( node in the centre of fig .",
    "[ schematic2](a)(ii ) ) and therefore does not contribute to the absorption because it has negligible field inside the layer .",
    "the maximum absorption of @xmath12 occurs when the even mode is totally absorbed . in order to increase the absorption beyond 50%",
    ", the excitation of the odd mode must be suppressed ; tla requires the structure either to not support an odd mode , or for the excitation of the odd mode to be forbidden by the symmetry of the incident field . with the odd mode not excited",
    ", tla occurs when the even mode is fully absorbed . in fig .",
    "[ schematic](a ) the absorbing layer is illuminated from both sides by coherent light of equal intensity , which totally suppresses the excitation of the odd mode and excites a longitudinal standing wave across the layer . this _ coherent perfect absorption _ ( cpa ) configuration @xcite produces @xmath13 with the same combination of @xmath14 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 that produces @xmath15 when illuminated from one side .",
    "previous studies @xcite have noted that tla occurs in homogeneous layers when , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fresnel reflection coefficient with normal incidence from the outside , and @xmath18 is the change in phase _ and _ amplitude acquired by a mode with complex propagation constant @xmath19 upon propagating a distance @xmath20 ( see fig .  [ schematic2](b ) ) . while eq .  1 has been reported previously @xcite , its origin has not been completely clarified . here",
    "we derive eq .  1 in an intuitive , rigorous manner that generalizes to multimoded structures .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "1 is consistent with critical coupling , where the loss rate of the resonance is set equal to the rate of incident energy ( see supplementary materials for derivation ) .",
    "critical coupling has been used to analyze spp mediated tla on corrugated metal surfaces @xcite .",
    "_ showed theoretically that a monolayer of graphene can achieve tla when placed on top of a photonic crystal whose energy leakage rate matches the absorption rate of the graphene layer @xcite .      in the symmetric configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic](a ) we can simplify our analysis by considering the properties of one half of the fabry - perot etalon with one incident beam .",
    "we begin with the resonance condition for a driven system in the presence of loss ; with reference to fig .  [",
    "schematic2](b ) this is @xmath21 where the first term represents a loop through the structure starting in the centre of the layer ( where the amplitude @xmath22 is marked ) , and the second term describes the contribution of the driving field to the resonance ( also evaluated at the centre ) . in the absence of a driving field ( @xmath23 ) , eq .",
    "2 reduces to the fabry - perot resonance condition , or equivalently the condition for a bound waveguide mode .    for total absorption",
    "we require a further condition : the amplitude of the outgoing wave must vanish , @xmath24 this expression also consists of two terms : the leakage from the resonant mode into the superstrate ; and fresnel reflection off the top interface .",
    "finally , eq .  1 is obtained by solving the simultaneous equations ( eqs .  2 and 3 )",
    ", using the relationship @xmath25",
    "@xcite .      rearranging eq .",
    "1 yields a transcendental expression for the complex refractive index required for tla , which holds for structures of any thickness , @xmath26 focussing on ultra - thin structures , we take the taylor expansion of the tangent function in eq .  4 for small arguments up to third order ( derivation in supplementary materials ) . this yields",
    "@xmath27 which produces results consistent with the expression derived by hgglund _",
    "( eq .  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "while eq .  5 does not extend to the case where the substrate and superstrate have different refractive indices , its far simpler form allows us to obtain further insights .",
    "equation  5 reveals that tla in ultra - thin layers , where @xmath28 , is always possible in principle , and requires @xmath29 with @xmath30 the slightly smaller .",
    "furthermore @xmath31 in these cases , which allows tla to be achieved with only moderately large @xmath32 even with very small @xmath10 .",
    "figure  [ epsilon ] shows the absorption as a function of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath14 , for a uniform film of thickness @xmath33 arranged as in fig .",
    "[ schematic](a ) and confirms that tla occurs where @xmath29 . throughout our simulations",
    "we take @xmath34 .",
    "very few natural materials satisfy the condition @xmath29 , making tla a truly unusual effect ; examples include dyes @xcite and the phase change material vo@xmath35 ( when heated to precisely 342  k ) @xcite .",
    "tla has also been demonstrated using metamaterials , whose subwavelength sized meta - atoms ( typically a combination of inductive and capacitive metallic elements ) are engineered to give an homogenized effective permittivity and permeability of @xmath36 , @xmath37 on resonance @xcite , which is consistent with @xmath38 . the taylor expansion used to derive eq .",
    "5 is accurate only when @xmath39 , which explains how cpa has also been demonstrated in thick ( @xmath40 ) wafers of silicon at wavelengths where @xmath41 is three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "having seen that tla is difficult to achieve in uniform ultra - thin layers , we now investigate how ultra - thin gratings made of common materials can achieve tla .",
    "we consider the volume gratings illustrated in figs .",
    "[ schematic](c ) and [ schematic2](c ) , a fraction @xmath43 of which has refractive index @xmath14 and the remainder of which is air , illuminated at normal incidence .",
    "the period of the gratings @xmath44 is chosen so that multiple bloch modes ( each corresponding to superpositions of diffraction orders ) propagate within the grating , but that only the specular diffraction order propagates away from the grating in the surrounding medium .",
    "these conditions require @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively , where @xmath47 of the grating is calculated using the linear mixing formula of the permittivity for te polarization ( the inverse linear mixing formula must be used for tm polarization ) .    the absorption of te and tm polarized light in @xmath48 thick lamellar gratings is shown in figs .  [ epsilon - te ] and [ epsilon - tm ] respectively , where the gratings have @xmath49 and @xmath50 . comparing these to the results for a uniform layer of the same thickness ( fig .",
    "[ epsilon ] ) we see that higher order diffractive grating modes drive tla at dramatically different values of @xmath14 than for homogeneous layers , and that the required @xmath14 differs greatly between the polarizations .      for te polarized light , fig .",
    "[ epsilon - te ] shows that tla occurs with refractive indices with @xmath51 ( far below the diagonal in fig .",
    "[ epsilon - te ] indicating that the gratings can be made of conventional , weakly - absorbing semiconductors .",
    "we have established that tla occurs due to the excitation of the fundamental te leaky slab waveguide mode , which has no cut - off .",
    "such guided mode resonances have previously been studied in detail for their broadband reflection properties @xcite , however tla has not been reported using this effect .",
    "examining the dispersion relation of the equivalent waveguide mode of the homogenized grating @xcite indicates that the absorption peak at @xmath52 corresponds to the waveguide mode being excited by the grating s first reciprocal lattice vectors , @xmath53 , whereas the peak at @xmath54 is excited by @xmath55 .",
    "while the value of @xmath42 ensures that the guided mode is phase matched to the incident light , the corresponding @xmath41 determines the absorption loss rate of the mode that must be equal to the mode s radiative loss rate in order to fulfil the critical coupling condition and achieve tla .      the results for tm polarized light ( using the same gratings as in fig .",
    "[ epsilon - te ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ epsilon - tm ] .",
    "the refractive index that produces tla has @xmath56 , _",
    "i.e. _ , re@xmath57 , which implies a different underlying mechanism .",
    "tm polarized light , unlike te polarized light , can excite spps that propagate in the @xmath58-direction , along the interface between the surrounding medium and a metallic grating , with re@xmath59 and re@xmath57 respectively . in ultra - thin gratings , the spps of the top and bottom interfaces couple , producing two modes : the long range spp ( lrspp ) ; and the short range spp ( srspp ) , which is more lossy because it is more tightly confined within the absorber .",
    "tla occurs due to the srspp because its dominant electric field component has an even symmetry in the @xmath60-plane , whereas the lrspp has an odd symmetry .",
    "the srspp creates a single absorption peak in fig .",
    "[ epsilon - tm ] because its propagation constant is @xmath61 , while re@xmath57 .",
    "we now present our experimental demonstrations of tla of te polarized light using antimony sulphide ( @xmath62 ) semiconductor gratings , placed above a metallic reflector as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ schematic](d ) .",
    "tla in this asymmetric configuration is driven by the same underlying physics as in figs .",
    "[ schematic](c ) , but allows for tla with only a single incident beam and is experimentally far simpler .",
    "@xmath62 was chosen as the absorbing layer because it is a stable semiconductor that can be deposited in thin films using thermal evaporation and it has a suitable refractive index and absorption coefficient ( in its as - deposited amorphous form ) to meet the tla requirements close to @xmath63 .",
    "we emphasize that the results of sect .",
    "[ gratings ] demonstrate that tla in ultra - thin gratings is a general effect that can be achieved using a very wide range of common materials .",
    "figures  [ fab](a ) and [ fab](b ) show sem images of a fabricated grating structure on a polished si wafer with light incident from air . from bottom to top ,",
    "the structure consists of : a @xmath64 ag reflector deposited by thermal evaporation ; a @xmath65 thick @xmath66 spacer layer ( refractive index @xmath67 ) deposited by plasma - enhanced chemical - vapour - deposition ( pecvd ) ; and a @xmath68 thick amorphous @xmath62 layer deposited by thermal evaporation .",
    "the grating was fabricated using electron - beam - lithography to define a mask in a pmma resist , followed by an inductively - coupled plasma ( icp ) etch using chf@xmath69 gas .",
    "further details of the deposition and processing conditions are provided in the supplementary material .",
    "the sio@xmath35 spacer layer is crucial for tla in the asymmetric configuration because the light striking the absorber from below must be exactly in phase with the light incident from above to prevent the excitation of the odd mode . in the idealised case of an infinitesimally thick absorber and a perfect mirror @xcite",
    "the required spacer thickness is @xmath70 .",
    "however at the wavelengths of interest in our demonstration , @xmath71  nm , ag is an imperfect metal , which requires @xmath72 ( details in supplementary materials ) .",
    "we here focus on two @xmath73  nm thick gratings , designed to achieve tla at @xmath74  nm and @xmath75  nm , which have @xmath76 , and @xmath77 respectively",
    ". the measured refractive indices of @xmath78 at these wavelengths are @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively , corresponding to absorption coefficients of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and single pass absorptances of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "optical reflection measurements were performed in a confocal microscope using a @xmath85 , na  =  0.4 objective lens , and a broadband supercontinuum light source . reflected light was collected by a @xmath86 core multimode fiber and coupled into a spectrometer for detection . the reflection spectrum from a planar , unpatterned region",
    "was compared to the spectrophotometer - measured reflectance of the same sample , and this was used to calibrate the reflectance from the patterned region .",
    "the measured ( symbols ) and simulated ( curves ) reflection spectra are plotted in fig .",
    "[ measured ] , and show excellent quantitative agreement , especially in the wavelengths in the vicinity of the reflectance minima , for which they are calibrated .",
    "the minimum measured reflectance is @xmath87 at @xmath88 , which corresponds to an absorption of @xmath89 since the ag mirror is sufficiently thick to prevent any transmission to the substrate .",
    "although it is not possible to measure the absorption in the @xmath62 and in the ag separately , we can infer these values with some confidence from simulations given the excellent agreement between the modelled and measured results .",
    "the simulations indicate that , at @xmath90 , the planar @xmath62 film absorbs @xmath91 , and the ag mirror absorbs @xmath92 ( @xmath83 total ) .",
    "after patterning the semiconductor layer , the calculated absorption increases to @xmath93 within the @xmath62 grating and @xmath94 in the ag ( the simulated absorption spectrum of the ag layer is shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ measured](c ) ) .",
    "we therefore infer @xmath95 in the experimentally realised @xmath62 grating . for the second grating the maximum absorption at @xmath96  nm is @xmath97 , which we infer",
    "is @xmath98 in the @xmath62 grating .",
    "this is an even larger increase relative to the planar sample ( @xmath99 at @xmath96  nm ) because the absorption coefficient of @xmath62 decreases noticeably with increasing wavelength , from @xmath100  nm to @xmath96  nm .",
    "having shown that tla can be achieved experimentally and numerically using a specific material , we now investigate what range of material parameters are compatible with tla in ultra - thin gratings . to do this we consider gratings with a range of @xmath101 values , and numerically optimize the @xmath44 and @xmath43 of the grating such that the absorption is maximized .",
    "our optimizations were carried out in terms of @xmath101 because we established that the properties of ultra - thin lamellar gratings depend only on this parameter .",
    "the relation @xmath31 therefore applies to both homogeneous layers and gratings .",
    "our proof of this property , presented in the supplementary material , involves reducing the finitely conducting lamellar grating formulation @xcite to the grating layer formulation of petit and bouchitt @xcite in the limit of infinitesimal thickness , and is consistent with the formulation of perfectly conducting zero thickness gratings @xcite .",
    "the results of the optimization for te and tm polarized light are shown in figs .  [",
    "epsilon_b](a ) and [ epsilon_b](b ) respectively . here",
    "the coloured contours show the maximum absorption obtained at each value of @xmath101 , and the black dashed curves indicate the @xmath101 of ultra - thin layers of common materials across the visible spectrum , @xmath102  nm . in fig .",
    "[ epsilon_b](a ) the dashed curves correspond to @xmath103 layers of cdte , inp , gaas ( left to right ) , and @xmath104 layers of sb@xmath35s@xmath69 ( furthest right ) .",
    "the values of our experimental demonstrations in sb@xmath35s@xmath69 at @xmath105 are marked by a magenta triangle and circle respectively . in fig .",
    "[ epsilon_b](b ) meanwhile , the dashed curves show the values for @xmath106 thick layers of cu , au , and ag @xcite ( top to bottom ) , across the same visible wavelength range .",
    "comparing these trajectories with the optimized absorption indicates that tla can be achieved across almost the whole visible spectrum .",
    "the position of the dashed curves expand / contract radially from the origin when the @xmath107 ratio is decreased / increased .      in order to analyse tla in gratings",
    "we examine the coupling coefficients between the grating modes and the plane waves of the surrounding medium ( fig .",
    "[ schematic2](c ) ) ; for example , @xmath108 is the coupling coefficient of the incident specular plane wave with the `` fundamental '' grating mode ( labelled bm0 ) , while @xmath109 describes the reflection of the fundamental grating mode into the `` higher order '' grating mode ( labelled bm1 ) .",
    "we consider the case of normal incidence upon a grating in which only two modes propagate , whose amplitudes are @xmath110 , @xmath111 ; when more modes propagate ( such as at non - normal incidence ) the expressions generalize with scattering matrices representing the coupling between all propagating modes .    in the case of two propagating modes ,",
    "the resonance condition of bm1 is given by @xmath112 from left to right , these terms represent : the light incident from the surrounding medium ; the coupling between bm0 , and bm1 ; and the fabry - perot resonance of bm1 .",
    "combining this with the resonance condition of bm0 ( including cross coupling ) , and the requirement of no outgoing wave , we find that tla occurs when @xmath113 the top left quadrant of eq .  7 reproduces the condition for tla in uniform films ( _ i.e. _ eq .  2 , and 3 ) , where only one mode propagates within the absorber .",
    "equation  7 accurately predicts the complex refractive indices that maximise the absorption of ultra - thin gratings ( figs .",
    "[ epsilon - te ] and [ epsilon - tm ] ) and we now draw on it to understand the differences between the total absorption of te and tm polarized light .      a striking difference between figs .",
    "[ epsilon - te ] and [ epsilon - tm ] is that there is no absorption peak due to the excitation of the fundamental tm waveguide mode in figs .",
    "[ epsilon - tm ] , even though this mode also has no cut - off .",
    "this is because the field of this mode is concentrated almost totally within the air surrounds in ultra - thin structures , with only very little field inside the absorber , which is expressed in a modal effective index of the mode being @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "this field distribution prevents the mode from contributing noticeably to the absorption and also means the mode is very weakly excited , because there is a negligible overlap between the guided mode and the incident field . the analysis using eq .",
    "7 leads to the same conclusion ; the phase of @xmath115 is approximately @xmath116 and @xmath117 , for te and tm respectively , corresponding to a node and an anti - node of the electric field close to the grating s interface @xcite . in order to observe an absorption peak for tm polarized light in gratings with @xmath118",
    ", the refractive index range must be increased to @xmath119 , which is unrealistic , or the thickness of a structure with @xmath120 must be increased to @xmath121  nm , at which point the structure is no longer ultra - thin .",
    "[ conclusion ] we have shown theoretically and experimentally that ultra - thin gratings made of a wide range of weakly - absorbing semiconductors can absorb nearly 100% of te polarized light .",
    "we also showed theoretically that tm polarized light can be totally absorbed in ultra - thin gratings made of metals .",
    "we measure a peak absorptance of @xmath89 at @xmath100  nm , in a structure with a 41  nm thick @xmath62 grating , where @xmath95 within the grating .",
    "our findings show that the total absorption of shorter visible wavelengths can be straightforwardly achieved by using thinner gratings or materials with smaller @xmath122 .",
    "our gratings are far simpler to design and fabricate than existing ultra - thin perfect absorbers which rely on exotic materials and metamaterials , and may be generalized to achieve tla of both polarizations simultaneously by using bi - periodic structures .",
