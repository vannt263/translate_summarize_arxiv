    "two dimensional integrable field theories have become an area of extensive study .",
    "their rich underlying mathematical structure allows for their exact solution .",
    "this in turn provides valuable information about the wide range of physical phenomena which integrable field theories can be used to model , and more generally about non - perturbative field theory . a number of models have been studied in the presence of a boundary .",
    "this has led to results for both the classical and quantum scattering of objects , like particles and solitons , off the boundary . in particular toda models",
    "@xcite , the sine - gordon model @xcite , and the sinh - gordon model@xcite amongst others have been studied on the half - line .    in this paper",
    "we study the classical two dimensional complex sine - gordon ( csg ) model in the presence of a boundary .",
    "the model in the bulk is described by the following lagrangian    @xmath0    where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "the field @xmath5 is complex , @xmath6 is a real coupling constant and the parameter @xmath7 can be changed by rescaling @xmath5 and will henceforth be set to one .",
    "the lagrangian is invariant under global phase rotations of the field @xmath5 and this leads to a conserved @xmath8 charge .    as such",
    ", the complex sine - gordon model comprises an integrable generalisation of the sine - gordon theory , with an internal @xmath8 degree of freedom .",
    "it was first introduced independently by lund and regge as a model of relativistic vortices in a superfluid @xcite and by pohlmeyer in a dimensional reduction of a o(4 ) non - linear @xmath9-model @xcite .",
    "it belongs to a class of generalisations of the sine - gordon theory , which in the literature is referred to as homogeneous sine - gordon theories .",
    "the latter appear as @xmath10 gauged wess - zumino - witten models perturbed by a potential .",
    "these generalisations describe integrable perturbations of @xmath11 conformal field theories and have been studied in the bulk in @xcite .",
    "the csg model appears as the simplest case where @xmath12 and describes integrable perturbations of * z*@xmath13 parafermions by the first thermal operator @xcite .",
    "the quantum case was also studied by dorey and hollowood in @xcite , and maillet and de vega in @xcite .",
    "the csg model has found many applications in different fields of physics , from general relativity @xcite , to the description of propagating optical pulses in a non - linear medium @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the csg theory was used as a generalisation of the pioneering work of mccall and hahn @xcite , where the simple sine - gordon ( sg ) was used as a field theory description .",
    "the csg theory provides for a more realistic description of optical pulses incorporating effects like frequency detuning and modulation , while at the same time the theory can be extended beyond the description of two - level atom systems to multi - level atom systems .    in the next section of this paper",
    "some aspects of the theory in the bulk will be reviewed .",
    "classical solutions , including particles , solitons and breathers will be presented for the model in the bulk clarifying previous treatments . unlike the sine - gordon model where the soliton solutions are topological in nature ,",
    "the csg model solitons which carry a nether @xmath8 charge , have no obvious topological charge associated with them .",
    "this follows from the trivial vacuum structure of the model for @xmath14 , although as we shall explain chargeless solitons do carry the topological charge of the sine - gordon model in a subtle way .",
    "we also discuss the existence of breathers and find a class of charged breather solutions .    in section 3",
    ", we consider the effect of introducing a boundary and suitable boundary conditions are found which preserve the integrability of the model.in order to do this we explicitly construct low - spin conserved charges by abelianising the lax pair description of the model , and ensure that these are conserved on the half - line by imposing boundary conditions .",
    "we find a natural generalisation of the boundary conditions that ghoshal and zamolodchikov @xcite introduced for the sine - gordon theory .    the final section in the main body of the paper deals with the scattering of particles and solitons .",
    "we find the corresponding solutions and use them to calculate the classical time - delay .",
    "we also find solutions corresponding to boundary bound states .",
    "the paper concludes with some general remarks about the results presented , as well as a few open questions that are related with some interesting properties of the model .",
    "in this section we shall review some important features of the csg theory and establish our notation .",
    "we present the equation of motion , the relation of the model with the sine - gordon theory and review the mathematical background in which the csg model can be regarded as a perturbed gauged wess - zumino - witten model",
    ". moreover vacuum , soliton and multi - soliton solutions are written down in a compact form .",
    "finally , we clarify the existing confusion concerning the existence of breathers within this model and present explicit breather solutions .",
    "the lagrangian of the model was presented in ( [ eq : csglagr2 ] ) .",
    "we assume without loss of generality @xmath15 since the parameter can be dropped by rescaling the field variables .",
    "the equation of motion that follows is @xmath16 the relation between this model and sine - gordon becomes obvious if we substitute [ eq : u2phi ] u =  e^2 i  , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 real fields .",
    "we use this notation here which gives a more standard connection with the sine - gordon theory but differs from previous treatments by @xmath19 .",
    "this takes ( [ eq : csglagr2 ] ) to [ eq : lagphi ] = + 4 ^2 -4 ^2  .",
    "this is essentially the form of the lagrangian derived by lund and regge , and pohlmeyer . by taking the field @xmath18 to be constant",
    "the sine - gordon lagrangian emerges .",
    "as was demonstrated by bakas @xcite the theory can be reformulated in terms of a gauged wzw action .",
    "the corresponding action principle can be written as    [ eq : wzw1 ] s = s_gwzw+s_pot  .",
    "the action term @xmath20 is the well known gauged wzw action @xmath21 this action is defined in a three - dimensional manifold @xmath22 whose boundary is our compactified normal two - dimensional space @xmath23 .",
    "the field @xmath24 is an @xmath25 group element and @xmath26 is the extension of @xmath24 to the three dimensional manifold .",
    "the last term introduces gauge fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 which act as lagrange multipliers .",
    "the @xmath29 term is    s_pot =   ( g _ 3 g^-1 _ 3 )  .",
    "this term breaks conformal invariance and thus gives rise to massive states .",
    "varying the action yields the csg equations of motion which can be expressed in a zero curvature form @xcite    [ eq : lax ] [ + ( g + w g + i _ 3 )  ,  + ( |w- _ 3 g ) ] = 0  . from the variation of the gauge fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 , two constraint equations arise @xmath30 which are critical in order to make the identification with the csg theory .",
    "the connexion between the @xmath25 matrix @xmath24 and the complex field @xmath5 of ( [ eq : csgeq1u ] ) is given by [ eq : g ] g = (    rr u & -i + -i v &    )  , where @xmath31 . the field variable @xmath32 should not be considered as an independent field but rather as an auxiliary field that is properly defined up to a constant through the constraint equations ( [ eq : const2 ] ) . in the gauge",
    "where @xmath33 , the constraint equations take the form    = -i  ,   = -i  , whilst the equation of motion now becomes    [ eq : lax2 ] [ - a , - ] = 0  , where [ eq : a ] a= - ( g + i _ 3 )  ,  = _ 3 g  .",
    "this compact zero - curvature form of the equations of motion demonstrates the integrability of the model and will prove useful when we come to consider transformations and conserved quantities in later sections .",
    "from ( [ eq : csglagr2 ] ) it is easy to see that the energy of the csg model in the bulk is [ eq : bulkenergy ] h_bulk = dx ( + 4 u )  .",
    "the most suitable candidate for a vacuum , would be a constant value for the field @xmath5 that would force the kinetic term involving derivatives to vanish and at the same time minimize the potential term .",
    "it is clear to see from ( [ eq : u2phi ] ) and ( [ eq : lagphi ] ) that for @xmath14 the obvious choice is @xmath34 , while for @xmath35 the choice should be @xmath36 if we insist that @xmath37 .",
    "the sign of the parameter @xmath6 divides the theory into two sectors . in the matrix potential formalism",
    ", both sectors are treated simultaneously as the diagonal and off - diagonal parts of the field variable @xmath24 .",
    "in this context the fields @xmath5 and @xmath38 are both solutions to the csg equation each derived for a specific choice of @xmath6 , and each corresponding to a different vacuum .",
    "this is because the two sectors are connected by a duality transform which interchanges the sign of the coupling constant @xmath6 @xcite and simultaneously interchanges the role of @xmath5 and @xmath38 .",
    "that is to say the theory is invariant under the change [ eq : dual1 ] g g = i _ 1 g = (    cc v & i + i u &    )  ,  - , the latter representing a transform akin to the krammers - wannier duality of the @xmath39 parafermion theory @xcite .",
    "taking into account the invariance of the theory under this duality transform , we shall concentrate in this paper on the @xmath40 sector which corresponds to the diagonal part of the matrix formalism .",
    "a suitable vacuum solution would be [ eq : vacuum ] g_vac = (    cc 0 & i e^- i   + i e^i & 0    )  .",
    "this selection is consistent with the choices appearing in the beginning of this section with the diagonal @xmath14 sector , corresponding to the @xmath34 vacuum , while the off - diagonal @xmath35 to @xmath41 .",
    "it is noted that the apparent singular behaviour of the lagrangian at @xmath42 does not appear as a problem embedded in the theory but is a direct consequence of the fact that the gauge fields @xmath43 are ill defined at the specific point .",
    "the csg model , like the sine - gordon theory , possesses both particle and soliton solutions .",
    "when small perturbations around the vacuum are considered u = 0 + ( x , t )  , the theory becomes linear when higher order terms in @xmath44 are ignored @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the solution to the above equation is the familiar plane waves solution [ eq : planewave ] ( x , t ) = e^-i t ( a e^ikx + b e^-ikx ) , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are related through @xmath49    different techniques have been used for the construction of soliton solutions like the inverse scattering method @xcite and the hirota method @xcite .",
    "however both methods yield results that are both cumbersome and difficult to manipulate .",
    "the transformation for the csg model provides a more elegant way to obtain soliton solutions and can be written in terms of two matrix variables @xmath24 and @xmath50 @xcite    @xmath51 & = & 0 \\ , \\\\",

    "one - soliton solutions can be derived by applying the transformation on the vacuum solutions @xmath52 of ( [ eq : vacuum ] ) .",
    "each sector of the theory provides us with two sets of two first order differential equations that can be integrated , in order to provide the one - soliton solutions .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath24 which correspond to the @xmath14 sector give @xmath53 the one - soliton solution that emerges is [ eq : usoliton ] u =  , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are real parameters associated with the velocity and charge of the soliton respectively . this solution was originally derived by getmanov @xcite for the @xmath56 case .",
    "in addition an expression for the phase @xmath32 which appears in its dual field @xmath38 , is also obtained [ eq : theta ] = - - ( ( a ) ( 2 ( a ) ) )  . respectively for the off - diagonal elements that correspond to the @xmath35 sector , the set of equations is @xmath57 that finally produce a different solution [ eq : vsoliton ] v = - e^i ( ( a ) ( 2 ( a ) ) + i ( a ) ) , with @xmath58 a real parameter associated with the vacuum of the theory .",
    "this is the solution that was derived by lund and regge @xcite when considering the @xmath59 case .",
    "a two - soliton solution can be obtained through a non - linear superposition technique .",
    "starting from the vacuum of the theory and by the application of the transformation twice , a set of parameters \\{@xmath60 } is used respectively in each step .",
    "the same procedure is followed again where the two parameters are used in the opposite order . by demanding that the two results are equal",
    ", one ends up with an equation for the two - soliton solution in matrix form g_2s = _ 3 ( _ 1 g_2 - _ 2 g_1 ) g_vac _ 3 ( _ 1 g_1 ^ -1 - _ 2 g_2",
    "^ -1 ) ^-1  .",
    "the matrix field variables @xmath61 are of the general form of ( [ eq : g ] ) , with elements [ eq:1soliton ] u_k =  , v_k = -e^i ( + i )  .",
    "the identification one must make is : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a total phase .",
    "as expected @xmath64 has the same general form of equation ( [ eq : g ] ) @xmath65 the two - soliton solution and its complex conjugate are given by the diagonal elements of @xmath64 [ eq : u2s ] u_2s=  , [ eq : ub2s ] _",
    "2s=  , while the off diagonal elements represent the dual field and its conjugate v_2s=  , _ 2s=  .",
    "the expressions above represent two - soliton solutions to the equation of motion and are related through the duality transformation of ( [ eq : dual1 ] ) .",
    "multi - soliton solutions can also be obtained by following the same technique . instead of the vacuum solution",
    ", one can start from any given n - soliton solution @xmath66 and add solitons through the method described above , ending up with a @xmath67 solution .",
    "nevertheless , multi - soliton solutions for this model are quite large and their calculation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in this section we argue that soliton - soliton and soliton - antisoliton solutions presented in the literature by previous treatments , do not represent distinct classes of solutions .",
    "charged solitons are non - topological solutions , therefore a distinction between a soliton and an antisoliton is impossible . on the other hand chargeless solutions",
    "may be realised as topological solitons and identified with the sine - gordon solitons .",
    "the sine - gordon theory appears as the limit of the csg model when the charge parameter @xmath55 is set to zero .",
    "we can substitute in the equation of motion of ( [ eq : csgeq1u ] ) [ eq : sg ] u= e^2i  , where @xmath18 is now a constant to recover the sine - gordon model in the usual form ^2 - ^2 + 2 2 = 0  .",
    "the sine - gordon theory has topological solitons ( both kinks and antikinks ) interpolating between its degenerate vacuaa .",
    "in contrast the csg theory has a single vacuum for @xmath14 , and therefore its solitons are not topological in nature , but are stable because of integrability alone .",
    "the topological nature is hidden within the mapping of ( [ eq : sg ] ) and one has to be careful when trying to recover the sine - gordon soliton as a limit of the csg theory .",
    "nonetheless a subtle remnant of the topology survives the mapping to the complex sine - gordon theory . to see this consider how a sg soliton is mapped to csg soliton",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : vacuum ] .",
    "consider now how the potential term behaves as @xmath68 increases for the single soliton solution . as a function of @xmath5 we can express the potential as 2 = 2 = 2 u  , where @xmath18 has been ignored as a total phase .",
    "note that we should take the branch cut with opposite signs on each side of the point @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "we shall see that the changing sign of the branch cut for a chargeless soliton will be important when we come to consider the theory with a boundary .    in some sense",
    "the topology of the chargeless @xmath5-soliton is embedded in the the branch cut that appears at the singular point @xmath70 .",
    "the choice of branch corresponds to a different vacuum for @xmath17 and therefore to a different topological charge .",
    "however , when the charge parameter @xmath55 is not zero , then the @xmath5-soliton does not reach the sick point @xmath70 and remains non - topological . in this case",
    "no real distinction can be made between a soliton and an antisoliton . in the sine - gordon case ,",
    "the antikink solution is derived from the kink by changing the sign of the parameter @xmath71 of the transformation .",
    "this effectively corresponds to a parity and time reversal transformation which finally produces an antikink solution . examining ( [ eq:1soliton ] ) we see that in the csg case this change actually leads to the complex conjugate solution , by changing the sign of the complex phase . the change of sign in both @xmath72 and @xmath68 , can be cancelled by taking the charge parameter @xmath73 .",
    "it is thus clear that instead of changing the sign of @xmath71 , one could effectively change the sign of @xmath55 to derive an antisoliton .",
    "since the soliton solution is a smooth function in @xmath55 , the antisoliton is not a distinct object but can be identified with the soliton itself .",
    "this also has an effect on the two - soliton solution .",
    "if we follow the same steps as in the sine - gordon two - soliton solution then the solution @xmath74 of ( [ eq : u2s ] ) corresponds to both a soliton - soliton and a soliton - antisoliton solution depending on the choice of sign for the parameter @xmath75 .",
    "the parameter @xmath75 can be chosen in such a way as to describe one of the following @xmath76 here we have taken the two solitons to have equal and opposite velocity ( in general this is not the centre of mass since differently charged solitons have different masses , but it will be convenient for our discussion when we introduce a boundary later on ) . also for reasons of simplicity we will refer to the soliton - soliton solution as @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) and to the soliton - antisoliton as @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "however since no topological distinction exists between the soliton and antisoliton sector , it is possible to find a transformation of the parameters of the solution which effectively acts as a change of sign for the parameter @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , a set of transformations exists that maps @xmath77 to @xmath79 but we restrict ourselves to the simplest cases .    before introducing the transformation , we need to introduce arbitrary shifts in @xmath68 , which are crucial not only for this mapping but also later when we consider breathers and soliton reflections .",
    "the shifts appear in exponentials , so it is more helpful to consider the shifts in the following forms @xmath81 the parameters @xmath82 are directly related with both @xmath54 and @xmath55 and correspond to the arbitrary initial positions in @xmath68 , in the real ( @xmath83 ) and imaginary phases ( @xmath84 ) respectively , that appear in the one - soliton solution .",
    "specifically the parameter @xmath85 represents a translation in @xmath68 , while the @xmath86 parameter represents a phase shift in the internal @xmath8 space . for reasons of simplicity ,",
    "we include in the definition of @xmath86 the total phase @xmath87 which appears in ( [ eq:1soliton ] ) .",
    "henceforth these parameters will be referred as phase shifts , since they are directly related to the time - delay effect of the scattering process .",
    "now that we have defined the arbitrary phase shifts we start with the soliton - soliton solution @xmath88 which comes from the two - soliton solution @xmath74 when we choose @xmath89 .",
    "we consider the following transformation @xmath90 although this is enough to change a single soliton to an antisoliton , this is not the case for the two - soliton solution .",
    "the phase shifts have also to be fixed in a specific way to complete the mapping between @xmath77 and @xmath79 @xmath91 this effectively changes the sign of @xmath75 in the expression @xmath77 converting one of the solitons to an antisoliton .",
    "in contrast with the single soliton where the antisoliton can not be properly defined , in the two - soliton case there is a point of reference .",
    "a distinction between a soliton and an antisoliton can only be realised as a specific choice of the relative sign between the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath54 which does not in any case lead to topologically distinct solutions",
    ".    the same mapping between @xmath77 and @xmath79 can also be achieved by making the following transformation a_2 a_2 +  , which effectively changes the sign of all trigonometric functions involving the parameter @xmath93 sending the solution @xmath94 .",
    "this transformation will be used again on a later section when we come to consider soliton reflections , to demonstrate exactly the equivalence of the two sets of solutions .",
    "there are conflicting views in the literature concerning the existence of breathers @xcite .",
    "the problem arises because the transformation @xmath95 which is usually used to generate breathers from a two - soliton solution traveling with equal and opposite velocities , does not necessarily lead to a solution of the equations of motion . while the technique has been widely used before on other models , the fact that the csg equation involves both @xmath5 and @xmath96 , implies that naively analytically continued solutions do not necessarily satisfy the equation of motion .",
    "so it is not clear , for instance , that all the breather like `` solutions '' of @xcite do satisfy the csg equations of motion .",
    "however , since the sine - gordon is embedded in csg model by taking @xmath5 to be chargeless , the sine - gordon breather solutions do satisfy the csg equations of motion . in fact a family of charged , complex breather solutions does exist in csg model . although it is quite hard to actually check if a general breather solution satisfies the equation of motion , a trick can be used instead .",
    "we consider the two - soliton solution of ( [ eq : u2s ] ) and we demand that this solution is even in @xmath54 so that is effectively a function of @xmath97 . now",
    "the transformation @xmath98 , does nt change the reality properties of the solution but simply introduces an overall minus sign into the arbitrary parameter @xmath97 , which is irrelevant . making the solution even in @xmath54 , means that a few restrictions have to be imposed .",
    "firstly , the charge parameters have to be taken equal or opposite according whether @xmath99 is plus or minus one respectively .",
    "secondly , some of the arbitrary position parameters , have now to be fixed . however , up until now all the arbitrary phase shifts that appeared were either complex ( @xmath100 ) or real ( @xmath101 ) and there was no distinction between the shifts that originated from the space or time part of the phase .",
    "however , when constructing a breather solution , by analytical continuation of the @xmath54 parameter a separation between the space and time shifts is induced .",
    "all shifts that associated with space end up as real parameters , while time shifts become imaginary .",
    "we can restrict ourselves to shifts only in the @xmath68 direction .",
    "one could also consider more general phases which are complex and also depend on time and the parameter v. these however correspond to either @xmath8 rotations or time translations which make their use obsolete .",
    "the arbitrary shift parameters are now both real @xmath102 and should be compared with the general form of ( [ eq : shifts ] ) . in order to make a breather solution from the soliton - soliton case the following relations are required @xmath103 where the signs in these equation are correlated .    it should be noted that more breather solutions may exist .",
    "it is possible that through certain restrictions a more general breather solution can be obtained , but a direct confirmation through the equations of motion is rather difficult .",
    "an analysis of the quantum csg model @xcite suggests that the soliton can be identified with the elementary particle since the vacuum of the theory and the one - soliton are not topologically distinct solutions .",
    "evidence of this conjecture exists even in the classical picture . from our experience with the sine - gordon model , we would expect to identify the particle with the lowest energy breather solution .",
    "it would seem to follow that the breather whose energy and charge correspond to that of a single particle should be equivalent to a single soliton .",
    "this remarkable fact can be shown as follows .",
    "we consider the static single - soliton solution [ eq : staticsoliton ] u_s =  , where @xmath104 .",
    "the mass of the static soliton is given by ( [ eq : bulkenergy ] ) which after integration gives m_s = 4 m ( a_s )  , while the charge of the soliton is given by q_s = i = 4 ( [ a_s ] - a_s )  .",
    "the mass of a breather is twice the mass of a single soliton solution at velocity @xmath54 , which has been analytically continued @xmath105 m_b =  .",
    "the breather solution is effectively constructed from two one - soliton solutions , each with charge q_b = 4 ( [ a_b ] - a_b )  . in order to have a chance of identifying the breather with the soliton , we demand that the mass of a breather is equal to the mass of a static single soliton and that their charges also coincide m_s = m_b  ,  q_s = 2 q_b  . from the above relations ,",
    "one can solve for the parameter @xmath106",
    "if this value is substituted into the breather , then the solution collapses to a static single - soliton carrying double the charge @xmath107 .",
    "in other words , the single - soliton can always be considered as a bound state of two single - solitons carrying half the charge .",
    "the argument can be used recursively so that a soliton can be regarded as an infinite collection of solitons carrying fractions of the original charge . at each level",
    "a soliton is identified with a breather emerging out of a soliton pair of half the original charge . in the classical picture",
    "this process can be carried out indefinitely , but in the quantum case the finite character of the mass states restricts this procedure .",
    "this is not surprising since the static single - soliton of ( [ eq : staticsoliton ] ) can be viewed as a bound state due to the oscillation effect which creates a breather - like behaviour .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that any breather can collapse to to this solution when the parameter @xmath54 is properly fixed .",
    "it can therefore be realised as a breather solution after the collapse , exhibiting all of its former properties .",
    "one point that has to be emphasized is that breathers constructed with the method described in the previous section are not chargeless .",
    "this is due to the fact that the choice of the charge parameters @xmath108 is such that both solitons that are combined to create a breather have the same charge .",
    "this is confirmed by the above demonstration in which a breather collapses to a single soliton solution which carries double the charge of the breather s solitons .",
    "neutral breathers do exist but only at the chargeless limit and can be identified with the breathers of the simple sine - gordon theory .",
    "in the following sections we consider the effect of introducing a boundary into the csg model .",
    "although we are free to add any boundary potential to the lagrangian , we choose to investigate those potentials and their corresponding boundary conditions which preserve integrability .",
    "such choices allow the non - perturbative solution of the model which is one of the main motivation for its study .",
    "once such suitable conditions are introduced we examine the scattering of particles and solitons , and determine the necessary conditions for the existence of boundary bound states .",
    "we shall consider a boundary condition to have preserved the integrability of the csg model , if we can still construct an infinite number of commuting conserved charges .",
    "in contrast with the theory in the bulk , the introduction of a boundary destroys the translation invariance of the model but preserves the time translation invariance .",
    "it is thus expected that the momentum will not be conserved , whilst the energy will .",
    "this situation also holds for the higher - spin conserved quantities .",
    "all energy - like , parity - even quantities can be conserved , unlike their momentum - like , parity - odd partners . nevertheless ,",
    "since there is an infinite number of conservation laws , the main goal would be to concentrate on the conservation of the parity - even quantities .",
    "the presence of the spectral parameter @xmath109 in the lax pair of ( [ eq : lax2 ] ) implies the existence the infinite conserved currents in the bulk that can be determined through the method used by turok and olive @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by performing a gauge transformation @xmath110 [ eq : gauge2 ] = u a u^-1 + u u^-1  , in such a way that the commutator of the transformed gauge fields @xmath111 and @xmath112 of the lax pair to be zero .",
    "the equation of motion becomes ( | - ) = ( + )  , where the normal time and space derivatives are used .",

    "the instability can be viewed as a left moving chargeless soliton which approaches the boundary from @xmath223 . in the beginning while the soliton is far away from the boundary @xmath34 so that the boundary potential of ( [ eq : hb ] ) is @xmath224 . as the centre of the soliton passes through @xmath161 , the sign of the square root in the boundary potential changes . as the soliton moves to @xmath225 , @xmath5 returns to @xmath226 near the boundary but now we take the boundary energy with the opposite sign @xmath227 .",
    "effectively the sign of @xmath153 has been flipped to a positive value .",
    "the energy released from the boundary is @xmath228 , which is greater than the rest mass of a single chargeless soliton . at @xmath229 ,",
    "the soliton is emitted with infinitesimal velocity .",
    "as @xmath153 decreases , more energy is given up by the boundary and the soliton can be emitted with larger @xmath54 .",
    "this process agrees with the infinite time - delay effect which was encountered in the soliton reflections section .",
    "the soliton emission represents the time reversal picture of that effect in the chargeless soliton case ( fig .",
    "[ plotsg ] ) .",
    "it follows that we need never consider the situation where @xmath221 .",
    "the csg model is one of the simplest generalisations of the sine - gordon theory , but nonetheless has a rich and fascinating mathematical structure .",
    "in the first part of the paper we have examined the spectrum of the theory in the bulk and written down explicit two - soliton solutions within the framework of the matrix potential .",
    "we also demonstrated how to construct breather solutions in an elegant way avoiding the problems that arise by the analytical continuation of the parameter @xmath54 .",
    "there are two ways in which soliton solutions of the csg model differ qualitatively from those of the sine - gordon model .",
    "firstly , the solitons can be charged , so that whilst there centre of mass remains fixed , the solutions are not static .",
    "the second feature is that the csg does not possess degenerate vacua , and so the solitons are non - topological .",
    "there is therefore no distinction between solitons and antisolitons which can be interchanged by a continuous variation of the charge parameter @xmath55 .",
    "nevertheless , the topological nature of the sine - gordon theory can be recovered as the choice of branch cut of @xmath230 in the chargeless limit as was demonstrated in section [ sec : sad ] .",
    "a direct consequence of the non - topological nature of the csg soliton is that the breather solution can collapse to a single soliton when the parameter v is properly fixed , tying in with the picture presented in @xcite that particle and solitons can be identified in the quantum limit .    in the second part of the paper we introduced a boundary term in the csg lagrangian and demanded that the system remains integrable .",
    "first we constructed low - spin conserved quantities of the theory using abelianisation of the lax pair , and then derived suitable boundary conditions in order to preserve these . in the presence of a boundary , we examined the vacuum structure and showed that the bulk vacuum @xmath34 remained the true vacuum in the boundary case .",
    "soliton reflections off the boundary were also studied and the necessary constraint equations were written down in terms of the phase shift parameters .",
    "the set of equations was derived by demanding that the two - soliton solution satisfies the boundary condition .",
    "moreover the time delay induced by the scattering process was calculated in terms of the boundary constant c and was found to coincide in the chargeless limit with the time delay of the sine - gordon theory .",
    "finally we looked for classical solutions corresponding to boundary bound states .",
    "we found that it was possible to construct both bound soliton and bound breather solutions .",
    "we also found a bound state in the particle spectrum .",
    "this was unstable when parameter @xmath153 associated with the boundary energy was in the range @xmath221 . in this case",
    "the boundary emits a chargeless soliton , effectively changing the sign of the boundary parameter @xmath153 to @xmath231 .",
    "we end our discussion by pointing out a few aspects of the model that appear quite interesting and deserve further study . as mentioned in the introduction the csg theory was used to generalise the existing field theory approach of optical pulse propagating in a non - linear medium .",
    "a physical interpretation of the results appearing in this paper would be extremely interesting , especially the physical meaning of breather solutions and their application to physical geometries .",
    "an obvious extension of our results is to consider the quantum case of the boundary csg model .",
    "the s - matrix for the model in the bulk , which corresponds to perturbed @xmath39 parafermions , is known .",
    "it would be interesting to see if one can find a quantum reflection matrix , compatible with this s - matrix and with the classical results presented in this paper .",
    "as the simplest case in the family of homogeneous sine - gordon theories , the results might shed light on the more complicated models in the family .",
    "we would like to thank patrick dorey and roberto tateo for illuminating discussion during the preparation of this work .",
    "in order to construct an infinite number of conserved quantities when a boundary is introduced , we need to express the parity odd terms of the equations of motion as total time derivatives .",
    "the corresponding term of order @xmath232 is in terms of the fields @xmath5 and @xmath96 @xmath233    since we need the above expression to be a total time derivative we can eliminate any second order spatial derivatives of the fields by using the equations of motion of ( [ eq : csgeq1u ] ) @xmath234 we take advantage of the fact that we are free to add total time derivatives on this expression , since this represents a conserved quantity .",
    "the expression simplifies significantly by adding the following term ( 4 )  , which yields @xmath235 we are looking for boundary conditions that are of the form u = f(u , )  ,  = g(u , )  , where @xmath171 and @xmath236 are functions of the fields not involving derivatives . by direct substitution of the above into ( [ ap : l21 ] )",
    "we get @xmath237 the expression above does represent a total derivative when all terms are forced to vanish by selecting suitable functions @xmath171 and @xmath236 .",
    "the two separate differential equations that appear involving the undefined functions @xmath238 can easily be solved to yield [ ap : l23 ] f(u , ) = s_1(u )  ,   g(u , ) = s_2 ( )  .",
    "in addition , the last two terms in ( [ ap : l22 ] ) imply that f =  g  , using the above relation and solutions of ( [ ap : l23 ] ) into the remaining terms of ( [ ap : l22 ] ) , we can determine the remaining undefined functions @xmath239 and @xmath240 . the final form of the boundary conditions are @xmath241 where c is a real constant .                      h.  j. de  vega , j.  ramirez  mittelbrunn , m.  ramon  medrano , and n.  sanchez .",
