    "the problem of deriving relevant information on the diffusive scaling limit of tagged particle motion ( i.e. self - diffusion ) , from microscopic principles has been undoubtedly at the heart of mathematically rigorous statistical physics of time dependent phenomena , at least since einstein s groundbreaking work .",
    "mathematically rigorous investigation of tagged particle diffusion in systems of particles governed by deterministic ( hamiltonian ) dynamics is notoriously difficult even in one dimensional models .",
    "after remarkable advances achieved up to the late 1980-s ( see section  [ s : oldresults ] below and references cited there ) , in the last twenty years there seemed to be less intense activity in the field .",
    "this is certainly due to the difficulty of these problems and lack of technical tools to attack them .    in the present note",
    "we make a small but hopefully not completely irrelevant contribution to the subject .",
    "we investigate the @xmath0 small mass limit of the tagged particle diffusion in the so - called 1-dimensional rayleigh - gas .",
    "this system consists of an infinitely extended one - dimensional system of point - like particles of mass 1 and one single tagged particle of mass @xmath1 immersed in it .",
    "the particles perform uniform motion and interact through elastic collisions .",
    "the system is distributed according to the equilibrium gibbs measure .",
    "this means independent exponentially distributed inter - particle distances and independent normally distributed velocities with mean zero and inverse mass variances ( that is : equidistributed kinetic energy ) .",
    "it is a fact that the dynamics of the infinitely extended system is almost surely well defined under this stationary measure . that is : no multiple collisions and no accumulation of infinitely many particles in finite time occurs . randomness comes into the problem only through the thermal equilibrium of the initial condition , otherwise the dynamical evolution is deterministic .",
    "the central question is understanding the diffusive scaling limit of the trajectory of the tagged particle : @xmath2 , as @xmath3 .",
    "there exist a number of deep and interesting results related to this problem which will be shortly surveyed in section  [ s : oldresults ] . in the present note",
    "we investigate the limit when @xmath4 .",
    "we prove that in this limit the system becomes equivalent to another , new model of tagged particle motion , differing from the one described above in having instead of one central particle of different mass , all particles of the same mass but the two central particles interacting via a calogero - moser - sutherland - type repulsive potential , with random strength parameter .",
    "this result explains some phenomena observed in earlier computer simulations on the rayleigh - gas . in particular",
    "the instability observed for small values of @xmath1 .",
    "we also present numerical simulations on this new model .",
    "our simulation results reproduce very accurately the numerical value of the limiting variance of tagged particle in the rayleigh - gas , in the @xmath0 limit , which were obtained in @xcite . we claim that our result not only reproduces ( from a completely different approach ) the numerical value but",
    "also gives theoretical explanation of the phenomenon .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ s : models ] we define the models of interacting particle systems considered , their stationary gibbs measures and the stochastic processes whose diffusive asymptotics is later analysed . in section  [ s : oldresults ] we briefly survey the existing earlier results ( rigorously proved and numerical , alike ) on tagged particle diffusion in 1-d rayleigh - gas . in section  [ s : mtozero ]",
    "we properly state and prove the theorem which states that in the @xmath0 limit the 1-d dynamics of the rayleigh - gas with tagged particle of mass @xmath1 converges ( trajectory - wise , in a natural topology ) to the dynamics of the 1-d gas of particles with calogero - moser - sutherland interaction between the two central particles .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : newnumerics ] we present our new numerical results referring to this new type of interacting particle system .",
    "we should emphasize here that our numerical results are not just accurate reproduction of older computer experiments but are performed on a genuinely new type of model .",
    "one of the main points of this paper is exactly the fact that these genuinely new numerical results are in accurate agreement with the results of boldrighini , frigio , tognetti @xcite , giving independent enhancement _ and theoretical explanation _ to them .",
    "in this section we describe the models considered throughout the paper . in section  [ ss : statespace ]",
    "we present a formal definition of the state spaces and the natural measures on them .",
    "section  [ ss : dynamics ] , which gives a more verbal description of the time evolution in our dynamical systems , clarifies that these models indeed correspond to the one dimensional gases mentioned in the introduction .",
    "let : = \\ { = ( x_i , v_i)_i=1^ : ( x_i , v_i)^ ,   x_1=0 ,   ( x_(i+1)-x_i)0 } . with slight abuse of notation and terminology sometimes we do nt distinguish between @xmath5 and the ( unordered ) set of points @xmath6 .",
    "we endow the spaces @xmath7 with the topology defined by pointwise convergence : @xmath8 iff @xmath9 , for all @xmath10 .",
    "this is a metrizable topology and makes @xmath7 complete and separable ( i.e. polish ) spaces .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the following probability measures over @xmath7 , respectively . under @xmath11 the random variables @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , are completely independent , with exponential , respectively , normal distributions : @xmath15=_\\{x0}e^-xx ,   @xmath16=e^-v^2/2v",

    "we define the dynamics of the systems considered verbally , rather than writing formulas .",

    "the untagged gas particles perform uniform motion on the line and do nt interact between themselves , when two of them meet and cross each other s trajectory they exchange their index . the tagged particle , while isolated from the others , also performs uniform motion and collides elastically at encounters with an untagged gas particle . at these collisions the outgoing velocities @xmath42 are determined by the incoming velocities @xmath43 as follows : [ coll ] v^=v^ + v^ , v^=v^ - v^. mind that the untagged gas particles never exchange their order with the tagged particle and the index @xmath41 of a particle denotes its actual relative order with respect to the tagged particle .",

    "we denote by @xmath44 the measure preserving flow defined by this dynamics on @xmath45 .    the velocity and displacement process of the tagged particle is & & _ t= _ t():=v(_t ) + & & _ t= _ t():=_0^t _ s()s .    in section  [ s : mtozero ]",
    "it will be more convenient to describe the dynamics from a fixed exterior point of observation .",
    "the absolute locations of the gas particles in the system as seen from such a fixed exterior frame of reference are [ abspoz ] y_i(t):=_t+x_i(t ) , x_i(t):=x_i(_t ) , i=1,2,  .",

    "mind that there is no particle of index @xmath36 in this system .",
    "the system is observed from the centre of mass of particles of index @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we call this the central observation point . positions and velocities of the particles in the system",

    "when two gas particles meet and cross each other s trajectory they exchange their index . but",
    "mind that due to the strongly repulsive interaction between the two central particles , these two will never meet and thus particles will never change the sign of their index . the index @xmath41 of a particle denotes its actual relative order with respect to the central observation point",
    ".    * remark . * in the literature of completely integrable hamiltonian systems the pair potential is usually called calogero - moser - sutherland interaction and leads to one of the most notorious completely integrable 1-d systems , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the first original publications .",

    ".velocities in the @xmath66 approximation [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     in particular , the tagged particle reverts its velocity at collisions , thus its speed is constant , more precisely , equal to @xmath118 throughout the investigated time interval .",

    "we shall also comment on how these results are related to the @xmath66 limit of the variance for the systems of type @xmath31 , as established numerically in @xcite .",
    "these simulations of the systems of type @xmath32 were done by following a number of particles for some fixed time @xmath138 .",
    "the particles followed were those who were less than @xmath139 far away from the point of observation in the beginning .",
    "it is easy to check that with this method the probability of not following a particle that would indeed participate in the interaction , is negligible in all the cases we looked at .",
    "numerial simulation of the dymanics of type @xmath32 is relatively fast , since the equation of motion for the two particles interacting via the potential can be solved explicitly .",
    "( this observation is at the heart of the complete solvability of the calogero - moser - sutherland model . )",
    "the simulation for time @xmath138 was repeated over a sample of @xmath140 initial conditions chosen independently according to the appropriate stationary gibbs distribution . from this sample , the empirical variance was calculated for @xmath141 as a function of @xmath104 .",
    "the result of a typical simulation can be seen in figure  [ fig : alap_illesztes ] .",
    "the solid line is the best linear fit for the tail , while the dashed lines have slope @xmath142 and @xmath143 , and are drawn for comparison .",
    "as we can see , @xmath141 does appear to be asymptotically linear . to read the limit @xmath144 from the graph ,",
    "we need nt perform such a long simulation , during which this limit is well approached : the slope of the asymptote can be found with a good accuracy much sooner .",
    "thus all the limits given in the paper are obtained using this technique , and the time interval for the simulation is typically between @xmath145 and @xmath146 . in exchange , the size of the sample can be very big  actually , samples up to @xmath147 were used .",
    "we simulated numerically the dynamics of type @xmath32 for various fixed values of the parameter @xmath29 ranging between 0.01 and 100 .",

    "we see that @xmath151 , which is no surprise , since in the @xmath133 limit the system indeed behaves like the system of type @xmath31 with @xmath68 , which is known to have @xmath152 .",
    "see subsection  [ ss : spitzer ] and the remark after the proof of theorem 1 .    on the other hand , it is interesting to see that as @xmath153 , the limiting variance decreases , and even seems to approach a value near the lower limit @xmath142 , but not quite reaching this lower bound .",
    "we plan to return to this phenomenon in the forthcoming paper @xcite .",

    "second , using the data obtained for @xmath157 in the fixed @xmath29 computations ( see subsection  [ ss : fixedcnumerics ] ) , we computed the mixture ^2_:=_0^ ^2_c ( c ) c , which , of course , in principle must give the same value as the previous computation .    indeed , in the two cases we obtained the numerical values @xmath158 this result is very interesting , since it coincides exactly ( well within statistical error ) with the @xmath66 limit of the variance calculated numerically in @xcite , see .",
