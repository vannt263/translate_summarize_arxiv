    "the skyrme model @xcite is a nonlinear effective field theory of weakly coupled pions in which baryons emerge as localized finite energy soliton solutions .",
    "the stability of such solitons is guaranteed by the existence of a conserved topological charge interpreted as the quantum baryon number @xmath5 .",
    "more specifically , skyrmions consist in static pion field configurations which minimize the energy functional of the skyrme model in a given nontrivial topological sector . the model is partly motivated by the large-@xmath6 qcd analysis @xcite , as there are reasons to believe that once properly quantized , a refined version of the model could accurately depict nucleons as well as heavier atomic nuclei with mesonic degrees of freedom @xcite in the low energy limit .    in the lowest nontrivial topological sector @xmath7 ,",
    "the skyrmion is described by the spherically symmetric hedgehog ansatz which reproduces experimental data with an accuracy of @xmath8 or better @xcite .",
    "however , this relative success radically contrasts with the situation encountered in the @xmath9 sector , where the hedgehog ansatz is not the lowest energy configuration and would not give rise to bound state configurations @xcite .",
    "moreover , pioneering numerical investigations of verbaarschot @xcite clearly indicate that the @xmath0 skyrmion is not spherically symmetric , but rather possesses an axial symmetry reflected in its doughnut - like baryon density",
    ". further inspection of this numerical solution , in particular the profile function , suggests that the classical biskyrmion may be represented by an oblate field configuration . yet ,",
    "most of the trial functions used to describe such a solution assume a decoupling from the angular degrees of freedom , i.e. @xmath10 , as this is the case for the instanton - inspired ansatz proposed in @xcite or in the early variational approach @xcite for example . on the other hand",
    ", some axially symmetric solutions were analysed in the @xmath7 sector , by @xcite and @xcite respectively , to include possible deformations due to centrifugal effects undergone by the rotating skyrmion and account for the quadrupole deformations of baryons . here",
    ", our aim is to extend the work on oblate skyrmions in @xcite to describe dibaryon states .",
    "the classical static oblate solution introduced in this manner will provide a quantitative estimate of the axial deformation , which is different from a uniform scaling in a given direction as performed in @xcite .",
    "it should also provide an adequate ground to perform the quantization of the @xmath0 soliton .",
    "there has been several attempts to decribed the angular dependence of the @xmath4 solutions which is much more complicated than the hedgehog form in @xmath11 fortunately , a few years ago , houghton et al .",
    "@xcite came up with an interesting ansatz based on rational maps .",
    "the rational map ansatz provides a simple alternative compared to the full numerical study of the angular dependence of the baryon density distribution of multiskyrmions .",
    "it also yields static energy predictions in good agreement with numerical solutions for several values of @xmath5 .",
    "the most interesting feature of this method remains without doubt that fundamental symmetries of multiskyrmions can easily be implemented in the ansatz solutions .",
    "this provides a clever way to identify the symmetries of the exact solutions , which are not always apparent , and in some cases , adequate initial solutions for lengthy numerical calculations .",
    "close as it may be , the rational map ansatz remains an approximation and in some cases , more accurate angular ansatz have been found .",
    "for example , houghton and krusch @xcite slightly improved the mass approximation of the biskyrmion by relaxing the requirement of holomorphicity imposed on rational maps .",
    "however , the profile function defined in this work still solely depends on @xmath12 . as may seems evident ,",
    "some accuracy still may be gained by introducing a more appropriate parametrization of the soliton shape function .",
    "recently , ioannidou et al .",
    "@xcite obtained similar results by introducing an improved harmonic maps ansatz where the profile function depends on radial and polar degrees of freedom as well .",
    "however , they had to deal with a complicated second - order partial differential equation .    from these considerations ,",
    "we propose a @xmath0 oblate solution based on rational maps , which could be understood as the rational maps solution proposed in @xcite with the radial dependence @xmath13 replaced by an oblate form @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , the soliton undergoes a smoothly flattening along a given axis of symmetry .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 provides a measure of the scale at wich the deformation becomes important while the solution preserves the angular dependence given by the rational maps scheme for the @xmath0 case .",
    "this choice is obviously consistent with the toroidal baryon density of the @xmath0 skyrmion .",
    "implementing the oblate ansatz to the model , we first integrate analytically the angular degrees of freedom .",
    "this explains why other angular ansatz such as those in @xcite and @xcite were not chosen ; they led to complications .",
    "the second step involve solving the remaining nonlinear ordinary second - order differential equation resulting from the minimization of the static energy functional with respect to the profile function @xmath14 .",
    "thereby , the parameter @xmath15 is set as to minimize the static energy , i.e. the mass of the soliton .",
    "although the method applies to higher baryon numbers and other skyrme model extensions , the analysis is restricted here to @xmath0 skyrmion for @xmath1 skyrme model .    in the next section ,",
    "we present the axially symmetric oblate ansatz for the su(2 ) skyrme model introducing the oblate spheroidal coordinates . in section iii",
    ", we briefly describe rational maps and show how they can be used in the context of static oblate biskyrmions .",
    "a discussion of the numerical results follows in the last section , where we also draw concluding remarks about how the oblate - like solution could be a good starting point to perform the quantization of the non - rigid @xmath0 soliton as the deuteron .",
    "let us first introduce the oblate spheroidal coordinates @xmath16 which are related to cartesian coordinates through @xmath17 so a surface of constant @xmath18 correspond to a sphere of radius @xmath19 flattened in the @xmath20-direction by a factor of @xmath21 . for small @xmath18 ,",
    "these surfaces are quite similar to that of pancakes of radius @xmath15 whereas when @xmath18 is large , they become spherical shells of radius given by @xmath22 . note that taking the double limit @xmath23 such that @xmath12 always remains finite , one recovers the usual spherical coordinates .",
    "thus , the choice of the parameter @xmath15 establishes the scale at which the oblateness becomes significant .",
    "finally , the element of volume reads @xmath24    neglecting the pion mass term , the chirally invariant lagrangian of the @xmath1 skyrme model just reads @xmath25^{2}%\\ ] ] where @xmath26 with @xmath27 . here ,",
    "@xmath28 is the pion decay constant and @xmath29 is sometimes referred to as the skyrme parameter . in order to implement an oblate solution ,",
    "let us now replace the hedgehog ansatz @xmath30 by the static oblate solution defined as follow @xmath31 where the @xmath32 stand for the pauli matrices while @xmath33 is the standard unit vector @xmath34 .",
    "more explicitly , this unit vector is simply @xmath35 as will become apparent in the next section , we consider the case where @xmath36 and @xmath37 i.e. @xmath38 and @xmath39 depend only on the polar angle @xmath40 and the azimuthal angle @xmath41 respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath14 , which determines the global shape of the soliton , plays the role of the so - called profile function . in that respect ,",
    "the oblate ansatz is clearly different from a scale transformation along one of the axis @xcite . as in its original hedgehog form",
    ", the field configuration @xmath42 constitutes a map from the physical space @xmath43 onto the lie group manifold of @xmath1 .",
    "finite energy solutions require that this @xmath1 valued field goes to the trivial vacuum for asymptotically large distances , that is @xmath44 .",
    "the expression for the static energy density is @xmath45^{2}\\right)\\ ] ] so , after substituting the oblate ansatz , the mass functional can be written as @xmath46=\\int dv\\left (   { \\mathcal{m}}% _ { 2}+{\\mathcal{m}}_{4}\\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath47 here , the notation is lighten by the use of the @xmath48 matrix defined as : @xmath49@xmath50 introducing an auxiliary variable for convenience , @xmath51 one easily deduces that @xmath52 and @xmath53 however , before minimizing the mass functional with respect to the chiral angle @xmath14 , in view to get the static configuration of the soliton , one must specify an angular dependence in @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this is the subjet of the next section , after a brief recall of some basic features related to the rational maps ansatz .",
    "formally , a rational map of order @xmath56 consists in a @xmath57 holomorphic map of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 appear as polynomials of degree at most @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , these maps are built in such a way that @xmath59 or @xmath60 is precisely of degree @xmath56 .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath59 and @xmath60 do not share any common factor .",
    "any point @xmath20 on @xmath61 is identified via stereographic projection , defined through @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the image of a rational map @xmath63 applied on a point @xmath20 of a riemann sphere corresponds to the unit vector @xmath64 which also belongs to a riemann sphere .",
    "the link between static soliton chiral fields and rational maps @xcite follows from the ansatz @xmath65 inasmuch as @xmath13 acts as radial chiral angle function . to be well defined at the origin and at @xmath66 ,",
    "the boundary conditions must be @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an integer and @xmath69 the baryon number is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the degree of @xmath72 we consider only the case @xmath73 here , so @xmath74 .    by analogy with the nonlinear theory of elasticity @xcite",
    ", manton has showed that the static energy of skyrmions could be understood as the local stretching induced by the map @xmath75 . in this real rubber - sheet geometry",
    ", the jacobian @xmath76 of the transformation provides a basic measure of the local distortion caused by the map @xmath42 .",
    "this enables us to build a symmetric positive definite strain tensor defined at every point of @xmath77 as @xmath78 this strain tensor @xmath79 , changing into @xmath80 under orthogonal transformations , comes with three invariants expressed in terms of its eigenvalues",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 : @xmath84@xmath85@xmath86 since it is assumed that geometrical distorsion is unaffected by rotations of the coordinates frame in both space and isospace , the energy density should remain invariant and could be written as a function of the basic invariants as follows @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are parameter depending on @xmath28 and @xmath90 while the baryon density is associated with the quantity @xmath91 in this picture , radial strains are orthogonal to angular ones . moreover , owing to the conformal aspect of @xmath92 , angular strains are isotropic .",
    "thereby , it is customary to identify @xmath93 and @xmath94 thus , substituting these eigenvalues in ( [ energy ] ) and integrating over physical space yields @xmath95 with @xmath96@xmath97 and @xmath98 wherein @xmath99 corresponds to the usual area element on a 2-sphere , that is @xmath100 . at first glance",
    ", one sees that radial and angular contributions to the static energy are clearly singled out .",
    "now , focussing on the @xmath101 case , the most general rational map reads @xmath102 however , imposing the exact @xmath103torus symmetries ( axial symmetry and rotations of @xmath104 around cartesian axes ) , as expected from numerical analysis @xcite , restricts the general form above to this one @xmath105 it has been showed in @xcite that @xmath106 , and thus the mass functional alike , exhibits a minimum for @xmath107 .",
    "then , one must conclude that the most adequate choice of a rational map for the description of the biskyrmion solution boils down to @xmath108 . recasting this map in term of angular variables",
    "@xmath109 , we get @xmath110 it is easy to verify that for @xmath111 the rational map is simply @xmath112 or @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and one recovers the energy density in @xcite .",
    "we shall assume here that this angular function still holds in the oblate picture in ( [ m2]-[k2 ] ) .",
    "after analytical angular integrations are performed , the mass of the oblate biskyrmion can be cast in the form @xmath115 with @xmath116 and @xmath117    the explicit expressions of the density functions @xmath118 , which are reported in appendix a , follow from straightforward but tedious calculations . adopting the same conventions as in @xcite , for the sake of comparison",
    ", we also rescaled the deformation parameter as @xmath119 , with @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the values of @xmath122 mev and @xmath123 are chosen to coincide with those of @xcite .",
    "now , the chiral angle function @xmath14 can be determined from the minimization of the above functional , i.e. requiring that @xmath124=0 $ ] .",
    "thus static field configuration must obey the following nonlinear second - order ode : @xmath125 here , the primes merely denote derivatives with respect to @xmath18 . solving numerically for several values of @xmath126 , we obtain the set of chiral angle functions of figure 1 .",
    "when @xmath126 is small , we recover exactly the solution of the @xmath101 rational map ansatz .",
    "let us stress that increasing @xmath126 enforces a continuous displacement of the function @xmath14 which induces a smooth deformation of the soliton .    . from left to right",
    ", we have @xmath127 0.5 , 0.2,0.1 , 0.05 , 0.01 , 0.005 and 0.001.,width=264,height=226 ]    .",
    "the mass reaches its minimal value for @xmath128.,width=264,height=226 ]    in figure 2 , we plot the mass of the oblate biskyrmion as a function of @xmath126 .",
    "the mass of the biskyrmion passes trough a minimum for a finite non - zero value of the parameter @xmath126 .",
    "this is a clear indication that the oblate solution is energically favored .",
    "note again that in the limit @xmath129 , we reproduce the mass value found in @xcite with the rational maps ansatz and profile function with radial dependence @xmath13 .",
    "numerical calculations carried out some years ago by verbaarschot @xcite and almost concurrently by kopeliovich and stern @xcite , establish that in the skyrme model the mass ratio @xmath130 is @xmath131 .",
    "the @xmath0 oblate solution also represents a bound state of two solitons since its mass is lower than twice the mass found in the @xmath7 sector @xcite . from our calculations",
    ", we get that the mass of the static oblate biskyrmion , being minimized for @xmath132 , is @xmath133 or @xmath134 mev .",
    "the parameter @xmath128 provides a measure of how the the @xmath0 solution is flattened .",
    "hence , the mass ratio of our flattened solution turns out to be @xmath135 . comparing to other ansatz for @xmath0  solutions ,",
    "it is fairly smaller than that predicted by the familiar hedgehog ansatz with boundary conditions @xmath136 and @xmath137 , since then @xmath138 @xcite or and still better than the hedgehog - like solution with @xmath139 proposed as in @xcite , whose mass ratio is @xmath140 .",
    "note that none of these solutions are stable solutions since @xmath141 .",
    "let us mention that kurihara et al .",
    "@xcite achieved a mass ratio of @xmath142 using a different angular parametrization .",
    "however , there are no obvious physical grounds for their angular trial function and it remains that rational maps are far more superior when it comes to depict the symmetries of the @xmath4 solutions .",
    "our results still represent a slight improvement over those obtained in the original framework of rational maps , i.e. @xmath143 @xcite , where the chiral angle is strictly radial .",
    "hence the oblate solution which depends of a spheroidal oblate coordinate @xmath144 captures more exactly the profile shape of the biskyrmion than the original rational maps ansatz does although both rely on rational maps .",
    "the relatively small improvement also suggests that a better ansatz for classical @xmath0 static solution would require a different choice for the angular dependence . in that regard",
    ", @xcite and @xcite both achieved a mass ratio of @xmath145 by dropping the constraint on the rational maps to be holomorphic .",
    "these alternatives remain very difficult to implement for an oblate field configuration .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the procedure presented here generalizes to any baryon number and any choice of angular ansatz consistent with multiskyrmions symmetries although analytical angular integration may become more cumbersome if not impossible in those cases .",
    "similarly , the approach can be generalized to other skyrme - like effective lagrangians .    in this paper",
    "we only investigated the classical @xmath0 static solution but in principle , the full solution requires a quantization treatment to account for the quantum properties of dibaryons .",
    "the most standard procedure consists in a semiclassical quantization using collective variables .",
    "it only adds simple kinetic terms to the hamiltonian but these energy contributions should partially fill the energy gap between the @xmath146 deuteron mass ( @xmath147 mev ) and that of our deformed @xmath0 static skyrmion ( @xmath134 mev ) .",
    "so , even if our analytical oblate ansatz is not necessarily the lowest static energy solution for the @xmath0 skyrmion , the optimization of the oblateness parameter @xmath126 should prove adequate to take into account the soliton deformation due to centrifugal effects , as for the @xmath7 case @xcite .",
    "thus , following such a procedure , we can expect that the properly quantized biskyrmion solution would provide a good starting point for the description of the low energy phenomenology of the deuteron @xcite .",
    "the problem of quantization of the oblate biskyrmion solution is an important topic in itself and will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "j .- f . rivard is indebted to h. jirari for useful discussions on computational methods and numerical analysis .",
    "this work was supported in part by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
