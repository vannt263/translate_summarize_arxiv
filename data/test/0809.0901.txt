    "in theoretical astrophysics the steady increase in computational power has sparked a proportional interest and progress in the study of large - scale structure formation . in particular , as @xmath0-body simulations of cold dark matter halos have become more detailed , several ",
    "universal  properties have emerged .",
    "we highlight three important characteristics .",
    "firstly , numerous cosmological studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) revealed similar density profiles over several orders of magnitude in halo mass , with a central cusp and an a @xmath7 falloff at large radii .",
    "these generalized nfw models can be described by a general 3-parameter family , referred to as the zhao models ( or @xmath8-models ) @xcite .",
    "they are defined by the density @xmath9 or in terms of the logarithmic slope , @xmath10 although in recent years alternative profiles based on the srsic law have produced equally good results @xcite , the generalized nfw models remain very popular and successful to represent dark matter halos .",
    "a second relation was found by @xcite .",
    "these authors identified that the quantity @xmath11 , which has become known as the pseudo phase - space density , behaves as a power law over 2 - 3 orders of magnitude in radius inside the virial radius , @xmath12 other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have confirmed the scale - free nature of @xmath13 , and their results indicate that its slope lies in the range @xmath14 .",
    "this property is remarkable since the density @xmath15 nor the velocity dispersion @xmath16 separately show a power - law behavior .",
    "finally , the velocity anisotropy profiles @xmath4 of dark matter systems also evolve toward a similar shape , steepening gradually from isotropic in the center to radially anisotropic in the outer regions .",
    "@xcite suggest a nearly linear relation between the logarithmic density slope @xmath17 and the velocity anisotropy profile , based on various types of equilibrated simulations .",
    "they proposed the @xmath2 relation @xmath18    several theoretical studies have been made to investigate whether solutions of the jeans equation exist that encompass the observed properties of dark matter halos .",
    "in particular , @xcite investigated the anisotropic jeans equation constrained by a slightly different form of the pseudo phase - space density , namely @xmath19 with @xmath20 the radial velocity dispersion .",
    "they found a special solution , namely an analytical self - consistent potential - density pair of the form ( [ zhao ] ) with an anisotropy profile @xmath21 that also has an exactly linear @xmath2 relation ( in other words , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "as these jeans models satisfy the three universal relations mentioned above , we can consider them as representative models for realistic dark matter halos .",
    "the goal of this paper is to take the analytical study of dark matter systems a step further , i.e.  to look for full dynamical models that encompass the universal properties found in @xmath0-body simulations . in concreto",
    "we will look for phase - space distribution functions ( dfs ) @xmath24 that self - consistently generate the required density , potential , and anisotropy profiles encountered in dark matter halos .",
    "such dynamical models would provide a very useful complementary approach to gain insight into the structure of dark matter halos .",
    "we shall focus on spherical models , for which a dynamical description simplifies substantially as in this case the df can be expressed as a function @xmath25 of the binding energy and the angular momentum . but even if we limit ourselves to the spherical case , it is not straightforward to obtain such dynamical models .",
    "a simple approach is to solve the jeans equation and approximate the velocity dispersion profiles by a multivariate gaussian @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated however that these systems are far from equilibrium , thus losing their initial dynamical structure as they evolve to non - gaussian velocity distributions in subsequent @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we therefore need the tools to derive full self - consistent equilibrium models , governed by dfs with a sufficiently general velocity anisotropy profile .",
    "simple analytical models are found for only a few special cases , such as the plummer , hernquist , isochrone , and @xmath26-models , none of which are able to describe realistic dark matter halos . for general potential - density pairs , @xcite and @xcite provided an algorithm to construct dynamical models with a specific velocity anisotropy profile of the form ( [ betagen ] ) , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , leaving @xmath30 as a free parameter .",
    "while the osipkov - merritt method has been widely adopted ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , comparison with simulations shows that such anisotropy profiles are too steep to describe dark matter @xcite .",
    "halos are not completely radial at infinity ( i.e.  @xmath31 ) and the linear @xmath2 relation can only be realized with a lower transition rate @xmath32 . on a dynamical note ,",
    "the associated dfs are of the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 , creating an unphysical cut - off boundary for orbits with @xmath35 .",
    "hence , the osipkov - merritt framework is too limited to generate realistic dark matter systems , and a more extensive method is needed .",
    "recently , @xcite presented an interesting approach to generate dynamical models for potential - density pairs with a more general anisotropy profile .",
    "they proposed to express the df as a separable function of the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a double power - law function with three parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath38 .",
    "once their values have been determined , the function @xmath39 is derived from the observed density profile by a numerical inversion .",
    "this technique yields a three - parameter anisotropy profile that resembles eq .",
    "( [ betagen ] ) , where @xmath38 has a similar role as @xmath30 , and a fixed transition rate @xmath40 . in this manner",
    ", the authors were able to construct models with an nfw density with velocity dispersion profiles that agreed with their dark matter simulations .",
    "in this paper , we present a technique that enables us to obtain dynamical models with exactly the four - parameter anisotropy profile  ( [ betagen ] ) .",
    "we demonstrated in a previous paper how this can be achieved , by postulating a separable parameterized form of the so - called augmented density , which provides an equivalent description of a dynamical system .",
    "in certain special cases the transformation from the augmented density to the df is analytically tractable .",
    "we were thus able to derive a family of dfs for the generalized plummer models ( also called @xmath41-models or veltmann models , @xcite ) with a linear @xmath2 relation .",
    "since the generalized plummer potential - density pairs form a special class of the zhao models  ( [ zhao ] ) , we will now demonstrate that this result is a first step toward more representative dark matter profiles .",
    "in particular , we seek a family of dfs for the dehnen - mclaughlin systems , because of their unique property to satisfy a universal density , a power law @xmath42 , and a linear @xmath2 relation .",
    "we use a quadratic programming technique @xcite to build dfs as a linear combination of base functions of the form derived in . in this manner , we demonstrate that it is indeed possible to generate full dynamical models for the dehnen - mclaughlin jeans models , thus providing dfs that encompass the observed properties of dark matter halos .    our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ preliminaries.sec ]",
    "we describe the notion of a dynamical model and we briefly summarize the main aspects of the dehnen - mclaughlin halos .",
    "next we outline our modeling technique in section  [ modeling.sec ] : we explain the quadratic programming algorithm and we recapitulate the functions that we derived in . with these components , we can build a library to apply the qp - method to the dehnen - mclaughlin halos . in section  [ results.sec ]",
    "we present our results for a set of systems with different velocity anisotropy profiles , and we discuss the moments , phase - space dfs , and energy and angular momentum distributions for these models .",
    "finally , we formulate our conclusions in section  [ conclusions.sec ] .",
    "the dynamical structure of a gravitational equilibrium system is completely determined by the df @xmath24 , which describes the probability distribution of particles in six - dimensional phase space .",
    "a dynamical model is only physical if its df is non - negative everywhere . in the case of spherical symmetry",
    ", this df can be written as a function @xmath25 of two isolating integrals , namely the binding energy and the angular momentum @xmath43 with @xmath44 the transverse velocity , and @xmath45 the positive binding potential .",
    "for circular orbits the integrals of motion can be written in function of the radius @xmath46 , @xmath47 which can be solved to obtain @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "all dynamical properties can be derived from the df , such as the anisotropic velocity moments @xmath50 with @xmath51 the total mass .",
    "if the system is self - consistent , then the density @xmath52 is connected to the potential via the poisson equation @xmath53 furthermore , the second - order moments determine the radial and tangential velocity dispersions @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and the velocity anisotropy profile @xmath56 a df is only fully determined when all velocity moments  ( [ momdf ] ) are known @xcite . however , it is already far from trivial to obtain _ any _ non - negative df that adequately generates a given density @xmath15 and anisotropy profile @xmath4 . in this paper , we will focus our attention to one specific family of halos , namely the dehnen - mclaughlin jeans models , and we demonstrate that a family of dfs can indeed be constructed for these systems .      in the context of theoretical dark matter studies ,",
    "the model derived by @xcite is of particular interest .",
    "we summarize their main results in this section . instead of fitting a parameterized density profile to @xmath0-body simulations , they investigated the solution space of the jeans equation to search for models that explicitly obey the power - law behavior of the pseudo phase - space density . with the extra condition of a linear @xmath2 relation they found a critical solution that satisfies the condition @xmath57 with @xmath58 a scale radius",
    "in the remainder of this paper , we adopt the common value @xmath59 and use the notation @xmath19 .",
    "dehnen & mclaughlin derived for this case the exponent @xmath60 with @xmath5 the central velocity anisotropy .",
    "the corresponding potential - density pair is fully analytical , given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the incomplete beta function and @xmath64 the density can be equivalently written in terms of the slope @xmath17 , which has the same elegant form as the velocity anisotropy profile @xmath4 @xmath65 finally , the authors derived the corresponding velocity dispersions @xmath66 eqs .",
    "( [ pseudodens])-([sigmatdehnen ] ) characterize the dehnen - mclaughlin models ; we refer to their paper for more details .",
    "these systems are determined by five parameters : the exponent @xmath67 in the pseudo phase - space density , two scaling constants i.e.  the total mass @xmath68 and the scale radius @xmath58 , and the asymptotic anisotropy parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the authors also noted the remarkable property that the shape of the density profile ( and hence the gravitational potential ) only depends on @xmath5 and not on @xmath6 .",
    "while the dehnen - mclaughlin jeans models are derived from theoretical considerations , they also fit adequately galaxy - sized and certain cluster - sized halos generated by @xmath0-body simulations @xcite . but as mentioned in the previous section , the density and velocity dispersions alone do not determine the complete dynamical state of dark matter systems .",
    "we therefore aim to incorporate these profiles into self - consistent dynamical models , described by non - negative dfs .",
    "to find dfs that describe the dehnen - mclaughlin jeans models , we adopt the mathematical framework that we derived in .",
    "these tools enabled us to construct a family of components with the anisotropy profile  ( [ betagen ] ) , by means of the powerful augmented density concept .",
    "we summarize these results , and we demonstrate how to build a linear combination of these components using a quadratic programming ( qp ) technique @xcite . in this manner , we can fit a dynamical model to a given halo .      since our dynamical models have to reproduce the moments  ( [ rhodehnen ] ) , ( [ sigmardehnen ] ) and ( [ sigmatdehnen ] ) , we first seek dfs that are specifically designed for this task .",
    "this can be done by introducing the augmented densities @xmath69 @xcite , which extend the densities to explicit functions of both the radius and the gravitational potential . like the df",
    ", the augmented density uniquely determines the dynamical state of a spherical equilibrium system .",
    "both functions are connected by the relation @xmath70 if we define that all functions are zero when their arguments lie outside their physical bounds , we can use the laplace - mellin transforms @xmath71 with the inverse transforms @xmath72 combining these expressions with ( [ augdens ] ) , we obtain @xmath73 interchanging the integrals yields the formal relation @xmath74 the main strength of the augmented density formalism is the ability to impose very specific conditions on these functions , to obtain our objective .",
    "more precisely , we demonstrated in that separable functions of the form @xmath75 are particularly interesting , since in this case @xmath76 is directly related to the velocity anisotropy profile , @xmath77 with this formalism it is therefore at least formally possible to generate a df for a dynamical system with a given potential @xmath45 , density @xmath15 , and velocity anisotropy profile @xmath4 .",
    "if we postulate an anisotropy profile of the form ( [ betagen ] ) , the modeling procedure reduces to the computation of @xmath78 such that @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 evidently , the exact solution @xmath78 is generally of numerical form , except for a few special cases .",
    "this creates a problem to recover the df from the augmented density , because a direct inversion of the laplace - mellin transformation in ( [ rhodf ] ) is in general numerically unstable @xcite .",
    "indeed , the double integration in ( [ augdens ] ) smooths features in @xmath25 and the inversion procedure of determining @xmath25 from @xmath69 has the delicate job of unsmoothing the information contained in @xmath69 .",
    "consequently , a direct inversion can only be performed safely for sufficiently simple forms of @xmath78 .",
    "we therefore take an alternative approach . instead of solving ( [ rhoisrho ] )",
    "directly , we will approximate the given density profile by a linear combination of simple base functions @xmath82 for which the laplace - mellin inversions are analytical .",
    "the corresponding df is then simply the same linear combination of the associated base dfs @xmath83 , resulting in an analytically tractable function .",
    "this can be achieved by a least squares fit to a set of density data points , defining a quadratic programming problem in the unknown coefficients .",
    "various authors have successfully used a similar modeling technique @xcite . a qp - algorithm , suited for this task ,",
    "has been developed in our department @xcite , which we outline in the following section .",
    "consider a given potential @xmath45 , an anisotropy profile @xmath4 of the form ( [ betagen ] ) and a set of @xmath84 density data points @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "to model these data , we first construct a library of @xmath87 base functions @xmath88 with @xmath89 sufficiently simple to compute the associated distributions @xmath83 . from these components",
    ", we can extract the corresponding values @xmath90 our aim is now to construct a linear combination of @xmath0 components from this library that provides an adequate fit to the given data .",
    "such a fit can be obtained in a statistically meaningful way by minimizing the quantity @xmath91 which is a quadratic function of the coefficients @xmath92 , consequently defining a quadratic programming problem .",
    "the data points are given equal weights by setting the constants @xmath93 .",
    "to find such a set , we use an iterative algorithm @xcite . with this method , a set of components is successively built in @xmath0 steps . in the first step ,",
    "@xmath87 @xmath94-minimizations are performed using in turn each component of the library .",
    "the base function that yields the lowest @xmath94-value ( hereafter denoted @xmath95 ) is retained as the first element of our best - fitting set , with corresponding coefficient @xmath96 . in each next iteration ,",
    "the functions in this set are preserved , while the coefficients are allowed to vary .",
    "the set is subsequently extended by adding the component from the library that yields the most improvement of the fit , minimizing over all coefficients . in other words , suppose we have obtained the best - fitting set of @xmath97 base functions , with indices @xmath98 .",
    "then , we add in turn the remaining @xmath99 components from the library , and calculate the @xmath0 coefficients for each combination by means of the @xmath94-minimizations @xmath100 from these @xmath99 values , we determine the best fit @xmath101 and add the base function with index @xmath102 to the best - fitting set , denoting @xmath103 . by renaming the indices of this set , we thus obtain a linear combination of @xmath0 base functions @xmath104 with coefficients @xmath92 and a goodness of fit @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding df is then simply @xmath106 the qp - algorithm allows additional linear constraints on the coefficients .",
    "in particular , we impose upper and lower boundaries @xmath107 these constraints are not necessary , but they greatly reduce the computational cost in the calculation of the df . the reason for this is straightforward : if the components are computed with numerical errors @xmath108 then the total numerical error of the df is @xmath109 the higher the absolute values of the coefficients @xmath110 , the smaller the errors @xmath108 need to be to obtain a given @xmath111 , which increases the computational time .",
    "sensible boundary values ( [ qp4 ] ) enable efficient calculations of the df , while maintaining satisfactory fits .",
    "the resulting df also needs to be physical , i.e.  non - negative everywhere in phase space .",
    "we found that all our dfs automatically satisfy this condition without imposing explicit constraints .",
    "this procedure has several advantages .",
    "the resulting df remains analytically tractable , which also simplifies the computation of all the moments of this dynamical model .",
    "furthermore , only a limited number of data points are required , rather than the entire density profile .",
    "the same algorithm can also be applied to data extracted from simulations or observations , and a variety of different moments besides the density can be used in the fitting procedure .    finally ,",
    "since all components have a priori the desired @xmath4 , their linear combination will automatically generate the same anisotropy profile .",
    "this is a very significant benefit . indeed",
    ", practice has shown that it is particularly difficult to construct radially anisotropic systems from base functions that are too simple ( such as fricke components , @xcite ) with different constant anisotropies . in that case an additional fitting is required to the second - order moments . but",
    "more importantly , because radial orbits influence the density both at small and large radii , the summation of components with different anisotropies results into a delicate fine - tuning to obtain adequate fits to both the density and the velocity anisotropy .",
    "these problems are avoided if the components already have the correct anisotropy profile , and although it is more intricate to design such functions , this approach greatly reduces the complexity of the quadratic programming procedure .",
    "we are now left with the construction of a library of adequate base functions @xmath104 .",
    "the success of our modeling is largely determined by this library . as stated above",
    ", the components have to generate the anisotropy profile ( [ betagen ] ) , while being sufficiently simple to retrieve the corresponding dfs @xmath83 from eq .",
    "( [ rhodf ] ) .",
    "in addition , the subsequent densities @xmath112 need to be able to reproduce the specific characteristics of the given data to obtain a satisfactory fit . in the particular case of the dehnen - mclaughlin halos ( [ rhodehnen ] ) , this implies that the components should incorporate the central density cusp and the asymptotic density slope at large radii , using the given potential ( [ psidehnen ] ) . in",
    "we derived a family of base functions that meet all these requirements .",
    "consider the family of augmented densities @xmath113 where @xmath114 are normalization constants such that @xmath115 and @xmath116 denotes the depth of the ( finite ) potential well , @xmath117 .",
    "the normalization constants are chosen such that the sum of the coefficients of a good fit should approximate the total mass of the input data , i.e.  @xmath118 .",
    "apart from the four fixed parameters that determine the anisotropy profile  ( [ betadehnen ] ) , the @xmath78-part of these functions contains three additional free parameters @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which respectively determine the asymptotic behavior at infinity , the inner slope , and the transition rate between these two regions .",
    "they satisfy the conditions @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "all other dynamical properties can be calculated from these augmented densities .",
