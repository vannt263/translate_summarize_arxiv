    "the quantum mechanics without probability amplitude was proposed  @xcite , leading to the possibility of quantum information processing more directly in terms of probability i.e discrete wigner function  @xcite . in the same vein , it is exciting to explore quantum key generation  @xcite with polarization correlation function or expectation value of two observers . in general , two observers @xmath0 and @xmath1 will have eigenvalues @xmath2 corresponding to photon detection at the transmitted or reflected port of their analyzers . the correlation function shared by them is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the joint probability of detecting a photon in observer @xmath0 and @xmath1 with their analyzers at @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",

    "there are totally four correlation functions @xmath10 , where n = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , available from intrinsic polarization correlation of weak coherent states  @xcite , coherent light mixed with random noise field  @xcite and coherent light fields  @xcite .",
    "these four correlation functions have been demonstrated and used to perform bits correlations between two parties over a distance of 10 km , through a transmission fiber by using weak coherent states in ref.5 .",
    "one can predict the outcome of the other by guessing the @xmath11 through their projection angles and photon detection .",
    "the secure key bits between two observers @xmath0 and @xmath1 are then generated through sharing four bi - partite correlation functions and photon counting .",
    "the essence of the paper is to propose a new scheme for key generation based on single photons bi - partite correlation functions .",

    "the density matrix of the output state from the beam splitter is dependant on the integration over the phase space of p representation for the input product state .",
    "since the @xmath14 and @xmath15 are intrinsically correlated from the same laser , the integration over the phase spaces of @xmath14 and @xmath15 can produce the output state that is intrinsically entangled  @xcite .",
