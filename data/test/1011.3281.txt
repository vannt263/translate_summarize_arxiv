    "one of the more interesting consequences of binary coalescence is the _ recoil _ or _ kick _ velocity that the center of mass can acquire during the event .",
    "this possibility was first discussed by bekenstein  @xcite .",
    "kicks are generated by an asymmetry in the momentum carried away by gravitational waves ( gws ) : if more momentum is carried away in any one direction , then the center of mass will `` react '' by acquiring a velocity in the opposite direction to conserve momentum .    in one",
    "particularly interesting scenario where the black hole ( bh ) spins are equal in magnitude , opposite in direction , yet within the orbital plane , the recoil velocity can become quite large , a phenomenon that is sometimes called a _ superkick",
    "_  @xcite . at first glance , it is somewhat surprising that this configuration can lead to such a large recoil , as this is a highly symmetric orbit : the masses are equal , the spins are anti - aligned , and the system s total angular momentum equals the orbital angular momentum .",
    "furthermore , the resultant kick velocity depends sinusoidally on the initial phase of the binary , and linearly ( at leading order ) on the magnitude of the individual bh spins .",
    "a schematic explanation of the superkick was initially offered in ref .",
    "@xcite , as being due to the `` dragging of the inertial frame '' of one bh relative to the other , and vice - versa .",
    "this was expanded upon in  @xcite , where it was pointed out that , in addition to the frame - dragging effect , there is also a spin - curvature coupling effect responsible for the super - kick at the same post - newtonian order . from a distant observer",
    "s perspective , these effects cause the orbital plane to `` bob '' up and down in a sinusoidal manner , while the binary inspirals , with frequency equal to the orbital frequency .",
    "this bobbing motion by itself does not directly produce the radiation that must be balanced by a recoil .",
    "rather , the bobbing causes the radiation produced by the binary s in - plane orbital motion to be blue / red - shifted , in synchrony with the bobbing .",
    "it is this asymmetry in the radiation pattern that ultimately results in net linear momentum radiated in a direction orthogonal to the orbital plane , balanced by the remnant bh moving in the opposite direction , after coalescence .",
    "more recently , however , gralla et al .",
    "@xcite have argued , based on an electromagnetic analogue model , that the bobbing motion is purely `` kinematical '' in nature , and not responsible for the recoil .",
    "rather , they speculate that the recoil has to arise in a process directly related to the merger event which causes field momentum to be `` released '' and radiated to infinity . here",
    "we present a first study of the ultrarelativistic scattering of two bhs in the superkick configuration , in part to address the issue about the origin of the superkick , and in part to continue our study of the high - energy regime in bh collisions . specifically , we study two families of initial data , one leading to merger and one leading to scattering , although in the latter the bhs interact strongly . in _ both _ cases we find essentially _ identical _ recoil behavior of the center of mass following the interaction : the recoil direction is orthogonal to the orbital plane , and the magnitude varies sinusoidally with the initial phase , with a maximum proportional to the _ net _ energy radiated in gws .",
    "this is completely consistent with the original scenario where bobbing - induced blue / red - shifting of the radiated energy leads to the recoil .",
    "the only effect of the merger is to slightly enhance the radiated energy , and hence the maximum recoil .",
    "these conclusions do not necessarily imply that the electromagnetic analogue in  @xcite is incorrect .",
    "however , since radiation - reaction effects were not included in that study , it is conceivable that the same phenomena would arise in the scattering of appropriately aligned magnetic dipoles .",
    "in fact , then the two explanations described above might more be a difference in semantics , i.  e.  an issue of whether one considers radiation to be a `` release '' of `` field momentum '' , which could happen regardless of merger , as it does in the bh scattering case .",
    "several other interesting conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study , other than implications for the nature of the mechanism of the superkick .",
    "first , in the scattering cases , we also see situations where a so - called _ anti - kick _ is present ; i.e. , where the maximum instantaneous net linear momentum radiated is not equal to the final value . thus , again , explanations of this phenomenon relying on effects due on the presence of a common horizon ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) can not be the complete picture .",
    "second , to gauge the effect that spin in this configuration has on the overall energy and _ angular momentum _ radiated in a merger , we compare the results obtained for each sequence with those for an equivalent binary , except the bhs initially have zero spin .",
    "we find that spin has very little effect on the radiated energy and angular momentum .",
    "third , we show that subdominant effects in the spins scale as predicted by the `` spin expansion formalism '' developed by boyle , kesden and nissanke @xcite .",
    "this is true for both merging and scattering configurations ; the latter result is nontrivial , since the spin expansion was explicitly formulated for binaries that lead to mergers .",
    "fourth and last , these simulations result in the largest superkicks seen to - date in merger simulations , upwards of @xmath2 .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath3 larger than the maximum yet seen in quasicircular bh coalescences , and @xmath4 larger than those obtained by healy et al . in hyperbolic encounters  @xcite . in section [ speculations ]",
    "we provide some speculations on the maximum kick that could theoretically be achievable in any ultrarelativistic encounter .",
    "we note that such enormous super - kicks are not expected to occur in realistic astrophysical scenarios .",
    "an outline of the rest of the paper is as follows .",

    ", we have calculated the ratio to the radiated energy .",
    "some comments on this table are in order .",
    "first , in contrast with high - energy collisions , bh binaries in quasicircular orbits radiate a significant fraction of their energy during the early inspiral phase .",
    "for example , the total radiated energy for a nonspinning equal - mass binary inspiral and merger is approximately @xmath51  @xcite , out of which about @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is radiated in the last two orbits ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the radiated energy for the quasicircular entry in table [ tab : skicks ] has been obtained by averaging the values reported by lousto & zlochower for their @xmath54 sequence , but we can not rule out that the relevant value may be larger .",
    "on the other hand , the early inspiral appears to have less impact on the accumulated recoil , as intuitively expected : the gw flux increases more slowly during early inspiral , so that the orbital average of the net momentum flux is closer to zero ( cf .  sec .",
    "iii e of @xcite ) . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we will employ the values listed in the table , but one should keep in mind the above caveats and lack of high - precision data for long quasicircular inspirals .    a second comment on table  [ tab : skicks ] concerns the study by healy et  al .",
    "the sequence they simulated differs from the other studies in that they vary the linear momentum of the bhs and , thus , the kinetic energy of the binary . because of this , we only use one simulation from their figure  2 , which provides a maximum kick . in units of the initial bh rest mass @xmath55",
    ", they report an initial linear momentum of @xmath56 , a radiated energy of @xmath57 and @xmath58 for this simulation . in order to use their data ,",
    "we need to adjust for the different normalization ( with respect to the bh rest mass in ref .",
    "@xcite and with respect to the total center - of - mass energy in our comparison ) . including linear momentum ,",
    "the dynamical bh mass is a factor @xmath59 larger than the rest mass .",
    "therefore we estimate the energy radiated in their binary system as @xmath60 of the total energy of the system .",
    "finally , their data only allow us to estimate the maximum kick using the leading - order extrapolation in the spin magnitude @xmath50 .",
    "in the final two columns of table  [ tab : skicks ] we show the ratio of the maximum kick velocity , extrapolated to maximal spin @xmath61 , to the radiated energy per center - of - mass energy of the binary . for convenience , in this column",
    "we measure the recoil velocity in units of the speed of light @xmath62 .",
    "the results suggest that , to leading order and for equal - mass binaries , the maximum of the kick as we vary the orientation angle @xmath30 is proportional to the radiated energy , which itself is to leading order independent of @xmath30 and approximately equal to the energy radiated by the binary s nonspinning counterpart .      in this section",
    ", we speculate on several possible ways of extrapolating our results to the ultimate recoil achievable in any binary black hole encounter and on the related uncertainties .    assuming that the scaling observed in the previous section remains valid for arbitrary center - of - mass energies",
    ", we could derive a leading - order estimate of the maximum kick possible in any bh binary encounter _ if we knew the maximum radiated energy for equal - mass , nonspinning binaries_. this maximum energy has as yet not been determined , but ultrarelativistic grazing collisions with boost factor @xmath63 have been found to radiate as much as @xmath64 of the total energy of the system @xcite .",
    "extrapolation of the energy radiated by equal - mass binaries has so far only been achieved for head - on collisions . in this case ,",
    "@xcite predicts an increase in @xmath44 by a factor of about @xmath65 as @xmath21 increases from @xmath66 to infinity via extrapolation .",
    "based on this information , let us _",
    "assume _ as a working hypothesis , that grazing collisions of equal - mass , nonspinning bhs will result in maximum energies up to about @xmath67 of the total mass .",
    "when combined with the findings in table [ tab : skicks ] , this would result in an `` ultimate kick '' of about @xmath68 times the speed of light , or @xmath69 . in view of the assumptions made for this derivation ,",
    "this prediction should only be regarded as a rough estimate .",
    "the most uncertain assumption in the previous analysis concerns the maximum energy that can be radiated by equal - mass , nonspinning binaries .",
    "in fact , it may well be possible that _ all _ the excess kinetic energy can be radiated as we fine - tune the impact parameter around threshold .",
    "let us assume for the sake of argument that this conjecture is true .",
    "then , in the",
    "_ large@xmath21 limit _ , the maximum energy radiated would be @xmath70 for finely - tuned initial data . however , since spin does not change with boost , most of this energy will be radiated when the spin is insignificant relative to the total mass .",
    "the relevant question then becomes : _ how much excess kinetic energy is left once the spin becomes significant ?",
    "_ let us postulate that , for a given @xmath21 , the kick is proportional to the relative excess kinetic energy multiplied by an `` effective '' dimensionless spin @xmath71 : @xmath72 if we were to let @xmath73 , we would clearly have a problem , as we would not be accounting for the fact that the spin becomes unimportant for large @xmath21 , and we would arrive at a maximum kick speed at @xmath74 . if instead we define @xmath75 as the spin angular momentum normalized by the _ total _ mass , not the rest - mass : @xmath76 , then @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the proportionality constant .",
    "this scaling takes into account the two limiting cases : for @xmath79 no kinetic energy is radiated , so there should be no kick ; for @xmath80 the spin is irrelevant , so ( again ) there should not be a kick . quite interestingly , this ad - hoc ansatz yields a maximum kick at @xmath81 , the case studied here , and hence we can use these results to calculate @xmath78 : this predicts a maximum kick of @xmath82 .",
    "a higher @xmath21 binary , sufficiently fine - tuned to the threshold of merger , would presumably also yield a comparable maximum kick .",
    "for then it would loose most of its excess kinetic energy to gravitational radiation , and hence the last few orbits ( that contribute most to the kick ) prior to merger or scatter will occur at a much lower @xmath21 .",
    "a potentially more accurate way to estimate the maximum kick could employ the boyle - kesden expansion , eq .",
    "( [ thirdord ] ) .",
    "it is plausible to assume that the coefficients @xmath83 and @xmath84 appearing in the fitting formula should only be functions of @xmath21 .",
    "the numerical estimate of these coefficients shows that @xmath42 and @xmath43 , so these coefficients could have ( to leading order ) the _ same _ functional dependence on @xmath21 : say , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a constant .",
    "the main difficulty here consists of the fact that it is impossible to determine this functional dependence having `` sampled '' the function at only two values of @xmath21 ( i.e. , @xmath79 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "for example , if we assume @xmath87 we would get that @xmath88 is a good power - law scaling in the range @xmath89 .",
    "however it would be perfectly legitimate to assume ( say ) that @xmath90 , and then it would be impossible to constrain the three parameters of the model with two data points . as a matter of fact",
    ", we know that @xmath91 must asymptote to a finite limit as @xmath92 , because the kick velocity is limited by the speed of light .    in summary , with presently available data , we can not discriminate between the scenarios discussed in this section : ( i ) a tentative guess of @xmath93 if the proportionality between maximal kick and radiated energy holds for arbitrary values of the boost parameter , ( ii ) a significantly lower velocity of @xmath94 if the spin remains insignificant for the binary dynamics until most of the kinetic energy has been radiated away ; or ( iii ) a more complex scenario where the ultimate kick can only be predicted by a systematic expansion , as proposed by boyle , kesden and nissanke .",
    "of course , this uncertainty provides further motivation to simulate sequences of merging binaries with larger @xmath21 factors .      up until now",
    ", we have exclusively analyzed the final value of the radiated linear momentum @xmath96 , but not its time - evolution . here",
    ", we should distinguish between `` local '' bh dynamics and the presence of local extrema in @xmath97 , as measured in the wave zone .",
    "the former has been studied , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite , and reveals substantial reversals ( of order @xmath98 ) in local estimates of the bh velocities .",
    "these large variations are not mirrored in the radiated linear momentum as measured far away from the bhs , and henceforth , with `` anti - kick '' we exclusively refer to the deceleration visible in @xmath95 as measured far away from the bhs .",
    "this anti - kick has been discussed in connection with ringdown radiation from the remnant bh in refs .",
    "the addition of ringdown to post - newtonian estimates of the recoil generated by unequal - mass , nonspinning binaries has resulted in excellent agreement with numerical calculations . ref .",
    "@xcite attributed the anti - kick to deformations of the common horizon after merger .    on the other hand , it is unclear if the anti - kick has any physical significance at all . consider the instantaneous momentum radiated in gws in any specific direction as given approximately by a sinusoidal function ( from orbital motion and then ringdown if a merger occurs ) , modulated by an envelope proportional to the radiated energy , which is initially increasing ( motion to closest approach ) and then decreasing ( from ringdown in a merger scenario or due to increasing separations in a scattering scenario ) .",
    "then , there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect that this function , integrated in time from @xmath99 to some @xmath100 , should generically have its extremum at @xmath101 . as with many other properties related to kicks ,",
    "the difference between the maximum and the final value depends on the _ phase _ of the modulated sinusoid and it does not require any new physical mechanism to explain it .    the one piece of evidence we can provide to the explanation of the anti - kick can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vs ] , where we plot the radiated linear momentum , converted into a recoil velocity by rescaling with the final mass of the system , as a function of time .",
    "anti - kicks ( a decrease in the absolute magnitude of the kick velocity as a function of time ) are clearly present in both merger and scattering cases . hence",
    ", common horizon deformations can not be `` the '' explanation , as a common horizon does not form in the scattering cases .",
    "furthermore , since the magnitude of the anti - kick clearly depends on the initial phase of the binary , the data is consistent with the modulated - sinusoid description given in the previous paragraph .     as a function of time extracted at @xmath102 for the s - sequence ( upper panel ) and the m - sequence ( lower panel ) . for reference ,",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in this work we have studied grazing collisions of equal - mass bh binaries with antialigned spin angular momenta in the orbital plane  the so - called superkick configurations .",
    "we have studied two sequences with a moderate boost of @xmath103 : an m - sequence leading to formation of a common apparent horizon ; and an s - sequence where the two bhs eventually scatter off to infinity . within each sequence ,",
    "we have varied the phase angle of the spin angular momentum relative to the @xmath22-axis connecting the initial bh positions . for comparison ,",
    "we have also included two simulations of equal - mass , nonspinning bhs with impact parameters corresponding to the two sequences .",
    "we have shown that the qualitative details of the recoil ( sinusoidal dependence on phase , and the maximum being proportional to the total energy radiated ) is independent of whether merger or scattering occurs .",
    "for the phase angle resulting in the maximum recoil , we find @xmath104 in the merger sequence , and @xmath105 for the scattering case .",
    "thus , the mechanism responsible for the superkick is , to leading order , not related to merger dynamics .",
    "we have further found , as with earlier observations for approximately quasicircular binary systems , that the dynamics and net energy radiated in the orbital plane is essentially unaffected by the presence or orientation of the spins .",
    "we obtain radiated energies of about @xmath106 and @xmath107 of the total center - of - mass energy for the s- and m - sequence respectively , with no dependence on the orientation of the spins to within the quoted uncertainties of these numbers .",
    "the corresponding nonspinning binaries also lead to similar radiated energies to within the quoted uncertainties .",
    "the ratio between the maximum recoil and the radiated energy for our two sequences is very similar , and this has led us to compare our data to available results from the literature on quasicircular binaries and hyperbolic encounters of equal - mass , spinning binaries with opposite spins in the orbital plane .",
    "similar ratios between maximum radiated energy and recoil velocity are found in all cases . assuming that this scaling holds for arbitrary @xmath21 , a _",
    "guesstimate for the ultimate kick would be around @xmath93 .",
    "on the other hand , it is equally possible that the spin of the individual holes is insignificant until most of the kinetic energy has been radiated away .",
    "we have estimated the resulting consequences by introducing an _ effective spin parameter_. the ultimate kick would be smaller in this case , about @xmath108 .",
    "even if neither of these simplifying assumptions turn out to be valid , the determination of the ultimate kick can be obtained from a systematic expansion of the kick dependence on the binary parameters , as proposed by boyle , kesden and nissanke @xcite . in view of the substantial number of additional simulations required for this purpose",
    ", we postpone such a study to future work .",
    "finally , we have analyzed the time evolution of the radiated linear momentum with regard to the presence or absence of local extrema .",
    "the decrease in the absolute magnitude of the recoil velocity after reaching a local extremum has been dubbed `` anti - kick '' . in both merging and scattering sequences",
