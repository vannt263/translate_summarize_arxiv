    "let @xmath0 be any real number , and consider what happens when we repeatedly apply the function @xmath1 : @xmath2 clearly this sequence , the _ orbit _ of @xmath3 under @xmath4 , tends rapidly to infinity .",
    "indeed , if @xmath5 denotes the @xmath6-th term in the sequence , then @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "so the process may not appear terribly interesting .",
    "this changes rather drastically upon replacing the _ real _ number @xmath0 by a _ complex _ value @xmath3 and considering the sequence @xmath9 ( see section [ sec : background ] for a reminder of the properties of the complex exponential function . )",
    "in contrast to the real case , not every complex orbit tends to infinity : for example , there is a point @xmath10 such that @xmath11 , and hence the sequence defined by is constant for @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , things turn out to be extremely complicated :    [ thm : orbits ] each of the following sets is dense in the complex plane :    1 .   [",
    "item : escaping ] the set of starting values @xmath3 whose orbit ( defined by  ) diverges to @xmath12 ; 2 .   the set of starting values @xmath3 whose orbit forms a dense subset of the plane ; 3 .",
    "the set of _ periodic points _ ; i.e.  starting values @xmath3 such that @xmath13 for some @xmath14 and all @xmath15 .",
    "so , by performing arbitrarily small perturbations of any given starting point , we can always obtain an orbit that is finite , one that accumulates everywhere and one that eventually leaves every bounded set ! in particular , the eventual behaviour of a point @xmath3 under iteration of the exponential map is usually _ impossible to predict numerically _ : when computing the value of @xmath16 , there will always be a ( tiny ) numerical error , and according to theorem [ thm : orbits ] , this error can change the long - term behaviour of orbits drastically .",
    "this type of phenomenon is often referred to as _ chaos_. it is a typical occurrence in all but the simplest `` dynamical systems '' ( mathematical systems that change over time according to some fixed rule ) , such as the movement of bodies in the solar system   governed by newton s laws of gravity   or , indeed , seemingly simple discrete - time processes such as the one we are studying here .",
    "there are a number of ( inequivalent ) definitions of `` chaos '' ; the most widely used , and most appropriate for our purposes , was introduced by devaney in 1989 @xcite .",
    "this concept , formally introduced in definition [ defn : devaneychaos ] below , captures precisely the topological properties usually associated with chaotic systems .",
    "the following result is then a consequence of theorem [ thm : orbits ] .",
    "[ thm : chaotic ] the exponential map @xmath17 is chaotic in the sense of devaney .",
    "theorem [ thm : orbits ] is ( a reformulation of ) a famous theorem of misiurewicz from 1981 @xcite , which confirmed a conjecture stated by fatou @xcite in 1926 .",
    "misiurewicz s proof is entirely elementary , but not easy : it relies on a sequence of explicit estimates on the exponential map , its iterates and their derivatives .",
    "an alternative proof was later given independently in @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and @xcite .",
    "( according to eremenko , their research was directly motivated by the desire to give a more conceptual proof of misiurewicz s theorem . )",
    "a third argument can be found in @xcite . in all these newer works ,",
    "the result arises as part of a more general theorem , and requires a substantial amount of background knowledge in complex analysis and complex dynamics .",
    "the goal of this note is to give a proof of theorems [ thm : orbits ] and [ thm : chaotic ] that is both elementary and conceptual .",
    "it requires no background beyond a first undergraduate course in complex analysis , together with some facts from _ hyperbolic geometry _ that can be verified in an elementary manner .",
    "we shall explain the latter carefully in section [ sec : hyperbolic ] , after first reviewing the action of the exponential map on the complex plane in section [ sec : background ] .",
    "readers already familiar with this background material can dive in straight in with the proofs in sections  [ sec : escaping ] to  [ sec : periodicpoints ] . in section [ sec : further ] , we briefly mention further results and open questions ; since mathematics is learned best by doing , we end with exercises for the reader in section  [ sec : exercises ] .",
    "we hope that our note will give readers some insights into the beautiful phenomena one encounters when studying the dynamics of transcendental functions of one complex variable , and serve as an invitation to learn more about this intriguing subject .",

    "@xmath44 is mapped ( in an infinite - to one manner ) to the outside of the closed unit disc , and the left half - plane is mapped to the punctured unit disc . *",
    "the exponential map is strongly _ expanding _ when @xmath43 is large and positive , and strongly _ contracting _ when @xmath43 is very negative .",
    "since the exponential map spreads the complex plane @xmath45 over the punctured plane @xmath46 in an infinite - to - one manner , it is not injective , and hence does not have a well - defined global inverse .",
    "instead , we use _ branches _ of the logarithm : inverse functions to injective restrictions of @xmath41 ( see ( * ? ? ? * section  2.vii ) ) .",
    "it follows from   that such a branch exists wherever there is a continuous choice of the argument .",
    "for example , let @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath48 is bijective , and hence has a holomorphic inverse @xmath49 on @xmath50 , given by @xmath51 ( here , and throughout , @xmath52 denotes the natural logarithm . ) in particular , let @xmath53 be a disc that does not contain the origin , and let @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",

    "more generally , branches of the logarithm exist on any _ simply - connected _ domain that does not contain the origin , but for us the above cases of discs and slit planes will be sufficient .      we now introduce devaney s definition of chaos @xcite that was mentioned in the introduction .",
    "this is usually stated in the context of _ metric spaces _ ( see below ) , but we shall restrict to the case of dynamical systems defined on subsets of the complex plane . recall that , if @xmath63 , then @xmath64 is called _ dense _ in @xmath19 if every open set @xmath65 that intersects @xmath19 also contains a point of @xmath64 .",
    "[ defn : devaneychaos ] let @xmath66 be infinite , and let @xmath18 be continuous .",
    "we say that @xmath4 is _ chaotic _ ( in the sense of devaney ) if the following two conditions are satisfied .",
    "a.   the set of periodic points of @xmath4 is _ dense _ in @xmath19.[item : chaos_periodic ] b.   the function @xmath4 is _ topologically transitive _",
    "; that is , for all open sets @xmath67 that intersect @xmath19 , there is a point @xmath68 and @xmath15 such that @xmath69.[item : chaos_trans ]    topological transitivity means precisely that we can move from any part of the space @xmath19 to any other by applying the function @xmath4 sufficiently often .",
    "this property clearly follows from the existence of a dense orbit ( see exercise [ ex : denseorbit ] ) .",
    "in particular , theorem [ thm : chaotic ] is a consequence of theorem [ thm : orbits ] .",
    "( however , in section [ sec : transitivity ] , we in fact argue in the converse direction   we first prove topological transitivity of the exponential map directly , and then deduce the existence of dense orbits . )",
    "devaney s original definition of chaos included a third condition : _ sensitive dependence on initial conditions_. it is shown in @xcite that this property is a consequence of topological transitivity and density of periodic points , which is why we were able to omit it in definition  [ defn : devaneychaos ] .",
    "it is nonetheless worthwhile to discuss sensitive dependence on initial conditions , since it encapsulates precisely the idea of `` chaos '' discussed in the introduction : two points that are close together may end up a definitive distance apart after sufficiently many applications of the function @xmath4 .",
    "( this phenomenon has become known in popular culture as the `` butterfly effect '' . ) moreover , in the case of the exponential map , we shall be able to establish sensitive dependence before proving either of the remaining two conditions .    to give the formal definition ,",

    "* chapter 2 ) or ( * ? ? ? * chapter 2 ) .",
    "readers unfamiliar with this definition need not despair : on the one hand , it is only used in this subsection ; on the other , it will be sufficient to think of such a function informally as a formula that defines some notion of _ distance _ between two points of @xmath19 .",
    "the simplest example of a distance function on @xmath45 is the usual one , namely _",
    "euclidean distance _ @xmath71 .",

    "if we intend to use this definition , we ought to clarify which distance function we intend to use on the complex plane , and it is tempting to choose euclidean distance .",
    "this turns out to be a poor choice : even the `` uninteresting '' _ real _ exponential map discussed at the very beginning of this paper has sensitive dependence with respect to this distance ( exercise [ ex : realexp ] ) .",
    "the trouble is that , when orbits tend uniformly to infinity for a whole neighbourhood of our starting value , we would consider the corresponding behaviour to be `` stable '' , but orbits may end up extremely far apart in terms of euclidean distance .",
    "this issue is resolved by instead using the so - called _ spherical distance _ , which is obtained by adjoining a single point at @xmath12 to the complex plane   so a point @xmath29 is close to @xmath12 whenever @xmath77 is large   and thinking of the resulting space @xmath78 as forming a sphere in @xmath79-space .",
    "for this reason , the space @xmath78 is called the _",
    "riemann sphere_.    instead of introducing spherical distance formally , let us use the informal picture above to decide what sensitive dependence with respect to the sphere should mean . if @xmath80 are close to each other on the sphere , then there are only two possibilities : either both points are close to infinity , or they are also close in the euclidean sense . using this observation , we define sensitive dependence on the sphere directly and axiomatically :    [ defn : sphericalsensitive ] let @xmath81 be a continuous function .",
    "we say that @xmath4 has _ sensitive dependence with respect to spherical distance _ if there exist @xmath73 and @xmath82 with the following property . for every non - empty open set @xmath65",

    "it turns out ( see exercise [ ex : sphericalsensitiveimpliesallothers ] ) that definition [ defn : sphericalsensitive ] implies sensitive dependence in the sense of definition  [ defn : sensitivedependence ]   no matter which distance function we use on the complex plane .",
    "_ hyperbolic geometry _ is a beautiful and powerful tool in one - dimensional complex analysis ( as well as in higher - dimensional geometry ) .",
    "when discussing spherical distance in the previous section , we briefly encountered the idea of using a different notion of distance to the `` standard '' one ; hyperbolic geometry is another example of this .",

    "for example , while each path - connected component of @xmath129 is such a curve , and is relatively closed in @xmath129 ( i.e. , rays do not accumulate on points that belong to other rays ) the escaping set nonetheless turns out to be a _ connected _ subset of the plane @xcite .",
    "furthermore , while many rays end at a unique point in the complex plane , some have been shown to accumulate everywhere upon themselves @xcite , resulting in a very complicated topological picture . for which rays this can occur , and whether other types of accumulation behaviour are possible , requires further research .    taken together , these results provide some indication that the escaping set is a rather complicated object .",
    "in fact , even iterated preimages of the negative real axis ( all of which are simple curves tending to infinity in both directions ) result in highly nontrivial phenomena and open questions .",
    "in 1993 , devaney @xcite showed that the closure of a certain natural sequence of such preimages has some `` pathological '' topological properties .",

    "we can furthermore also ask about the relative `` sizes '' of the sets of points with various other types of behaviour ( for example , with respect to _ fractal dimension _ ) .",
