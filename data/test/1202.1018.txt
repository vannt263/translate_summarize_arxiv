    "majorana fermions ( mfs ) are their own anti - particles .",
    "they have been the subject of theories for more than seven decades without an experimental signature .",
    "however recently it has been suggested that these exotic particles can be discovered in condensed matters systems , in particular in topological superconductors ( tscs ) @xcite .",
    "tscs are superconducting systems that admit exceptional boundary states owing to nontrivial topology associated with bulk spectra inside the quasi - particle excitation gaps .",
    "these exceptional boundary states are coherent superpositions of electrons ( particles ) and holes ( anti - particles ) which , upon proper compositions , represent realizations of majorana states .",
    "the presence of majorana states in tscs is robust because of their deep roots in the global properties of bulk states .",
    "this leads to renewed efforts to reveal mfs in laboratories .",
    "two examples of tscs are chiral p - wave superconductors in one dimension ( 1d ) and two dimensions ( 2d ) . in 1d , a chiral p - wave superconductor may accommodate a pair of majorana bound states ( mbss ) separately at its two ends @xcite .",
    "the energy of this pair of mbss at large separation is exponentially close to the chemical potential by definition the zero energy of the superconductor , and each mbs hence provides a container for a mf to stay .",
    "recently , systems equivalent to 1d p - wave superconductors have been proposed based on proximity effects in 2d topological insulators @xcite , or even more close to experimental reality , in 1d semiconducting quantum wires @xcite . to detect mbss in these systems @xcite , and possibly to manipulate the mfs therein ,",
    "is of great interest in current research @xcite .",
    "2d chiral p - wave superconductors @xcite , and equivalent systems based on the proximity effect in topological insulators @xcite or semiconductors @xcite , are hosts for chiral majorana modes ( @xmath0mms ) , which are gapless , charge - neutral edge excitations .",
    "@xmath0mms can serve as coherent transmission channels for mfs , and hence are ideal ingredients for building mf interferometers @xcite ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) . unlike conventional ( electronic ) interferometers",
    ", these mf interferometers do not permit an arbitrary magnetic flux insertion due to the presence of the underlying superconductors . instead",
    ", magnetic flux in the mf interferometers is trapped in superconducting vortex cores and remains quantized in integer multiples of a flux quantum .",
    "in addition , each vortex here allows for one mbs @xcite , and the parity of the number of vortices gives rise to a @xmath1 -type of mf interferometry @xcite .",
    "mm ) coupled to one or several normal metal leads .",
    "the chiral majorana mode lives at the edge of the underlying topological superconductor ( tsc ) , which has a full pairing gap and is grounded .",
    "the interior of the topological superconductor may accommodate a number of vortices , each permitting a magnetic flux quantum to penetrate through and containing a majorana bound state .",
    "majorana fermions traveling in the chiral majorana mode pick up a phase that encodes ( the parity of ) the number of vortices , then scatter into normal leads . to generate charge current and noise majorana fermions interfere pairwise.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ] +    both examples mentioned above belong to the same universality class , labeled @xmath2 in the altland - zirnbauer classification @xcite .",
    "this means that in these systems time - reversal symmetry is broken but particle - hole symmetry ( phs ) as far as the bogoliubov - de gennes theory is concerned is present .",
    "effectively these systems are spinless , and the phs operator can be simply expressed as @xmath3 with @xmath4 the complex conjugate operator and @xmath5 the pauli matrix reversing the electron and hole components .",
    "we will limit ourselves to this universality class in this paper , and use the inherent phs as the only constraint to the scattering theory that will be developed here .",
    "scattering theory in mesoscopic physics @xcite has been proven a very useful tool in dealing with electronic coherent transport phenomena .",
    "recent developments have also shown powerful application of scattering theory to the topological classification of condensed matter @xcite , extending an approach known from adiabatic pumping processes @xcite . in this paper",
    "we employ scattering theory to investigate interferometers built on @xmath0mms .",
    "we pursue especially a general understanding of how mfs being exotic ( quasi- ) particles which are charge - neutral can be involved in charge transport .",
    "for such a purpose we adopt consistently the majorana basis in our treatment , where the scattering theory of ( charge ) current and noise takes interestingly an off - diagonal form .",
    "namely , it is the pairwise interference between transmitted mfs , instead of the self - interference of individual particles ( as for electrons or holes ) , that plays the central role in observables like current and noise .    in the following",
    ", we will first analyze the scattering at a junction between a @xmath0 mm and a normal metal lead , which turns out to be also pairwise in the properly - chosen majorana basis .",
    "in other words , the scattering at the junction can be significantly simplified in terms of both its physical picture and its mathematical parametrization .",
    "next we will apply the simplified scattering picture to compute current and noise in several examples of chiral mf interferometers , including prototypes like fabry - perot @xcite , mach - zehnder @xcite and hanbury brown - twiss two - particle interferometers@xcite .",
    "the emphasis of these calculations is placed on demonstrating the way majorana scattering amplitudes enter the expressions for current and noise , and interpreting the results in a consistent manner .",
    "most of the examples used in this paper have been discussed in the literature , therefore we will not dwell on detailed discussions about the implications of specific results .",
    "nevertheless our approach shows its elegance in dealing with chiral mf interferometers and in understanding them .",
    "to address the question how mfs can be involved in charge transport , it is necessary to analyze how they are contacted with a normal ( metal ) lead which is indispensable for measurements . in the chiral mf interferometry , where the propagating pathways for mfs can be devised to serve various particular interests , junctions between @xmath0mms and normal",
    "leads become a universal , as well as crucial , ingredient and deserve a dedicated investigation . in this section",
    "we will focus on such a contact problem , leaving the propagation of chiral mfs to be handled in the next section with specific examples of interferometers .    to this end",
    "we consider a @xmath0 mm tunneling - coupled to a normal lead which contains @xmath6 transmission modes around the fermi energy and is connected to an electron reservoir with chemical potential @xmath7 at its far end .. ] the junction is described by the scattering theory adapted to deal with interfaces between normal and superconducting systems @xcite .",
    "namely , the @xmath6 transmission modes in the normal lead are artificially doubled into their electron and hole copies , which are then treated independently ( but constrained by the phs ; see below ) with different occupation functions @xmath8 where @xmath9 with @xmath10 the boltzmann constant and @xmath11 the temperature , @xmath12 with @xmath13 the chemical potential in the superconductor . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath14 is much smaller than the superconducting gap , @xmath13 is fixed by grounding the superconductor , and energy @xmath15 is always measured relative to @xmath13 . in order to remove the artificial doubling from actual physical effects , it suffices to count only contributions by states with @xmath16 .",
    "specifically , the scattering matrix , @xmath17 , for the junction at energy @xmath15 is defined by [ eq : sm_eh ]    ^(+)(e ) + _ e^(+)(e ) + _ h^(+)(e ) +    = s(e )    ^(-)(e ) + _ e^(-)(e ) + _ h^(-)(e ) +    where @xmath18 is the annihilation operator for chiral mfs , @xmath19 is the @xmath6-vector of electron / hole annihilation operators in the normal lead and the subscripts @xmath20 always stand for the outgoing / incoming states .",
    "the operators here are each normalized by ( the square root of ) the velocity of the corresponding mode , such that @xmath17 is a ( @xmath21)-dimensional unitary matrix as a result of quasi - particle probability current conservation .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath17 by itself does not respect charge conservation because of the implicit presence of the tsc upon which the @xmath0 mm has to live .",
    "often it turns out to be more convenient to work with the scattering matrix in an alternative basis the basis is called the majorana basis and hence the scattering matrix is denoted by @xmath22 which is defined as follows [ eq : sm_mf ]    ^(+)(e ) + ^(+)(e ) +    = s_m(e )    ^(-)(e ) + ^(-)(e ) +    where @xmath23 with @xmath24 the @xmath6-dimensional identity matrix acting within the space of electron or hole modes .",
    "evidently @xmath22 is also unitary , and is related to @xmath17 by a change of basis in the normal lead : @xmath25    the inherent phs in the current problem imposes that , by definition , @xmath26 both of which apply to outgoing and incoming states separately .",
    "the latter of the above equations implies @xmath27 which allows us to regard the scattering modes represented by @xmath28-operators as artificial majorana modes .",
    "the scattering matrices constrained accordingly by the phs satisfy : in the electron - hole basis , @xmath29 where @xmath30 with the pauli matrix @xmath5 interchanges the flavors of electron and hole ; in the majorana basis , @xmath31 it is clear that at @xmath32 , @xmath22 becomes a real orthogonal matrix .",
    "indeed , in the rest of this paper , we consider the low - energy limit where the energy dependence of the scattering matrices in eqs . and can be dropped ( accordingly we will also drop the energy dependence of the operators for the scattering modes ) . as a result @xmath22",
    "is always taken to be a real orthogonal matrix with determinant @xmath33 ( i.e. @xmath34 ) .",
    "this significantly simplifies the theory that will be developed in the following .      in this section",
    "our goal is to understand the contact between a @xmath0 mm and a normal lead by decomposing the scattering matrix at the junction into its physical part and its ( physically ) irrelevant part .",
    "the physical part is what is relevant to physical observables in the scattering process , and can be taken as the canonical form of the scattering matrix ; the irrelevant part by definition does not make physical contributions . to achieve this goal",
    "we will work exclusively with scattering matrices in the majorana basis , @xmath22 , in the current section .",
    "the advantage of working in the majorana basis is that @xmath22 , being a real orthogonal matrix in the low - energy limit , is both a faithful and a convenient representation of the scattering processes which involve mfs .",
    "such a representation naturally includes all possible scattering events at the junction without additional constraints as eq .",
    "( i.e. the set of @xmath22 in the low - energy limit is precisely @xmath35 , while the corresponding set of @xmath17 is only a subset of @xmath36 ) .",
    "this greatly facilitates the decomposition that we will perform in this section .",
    "the disadvantage of working in the majorana basis is that the  artificial \" majorana modes in the normal lead , defined in eq .",
    ", are not associated directly with the distribution of electrons / holes in the reservoir .",
    "therefore we need to return to the electron - hole basis in the next section to compute physical observables such as average current and noise .",
    "nevertheless we will see that the decomposition of @xmath22 pays off not only in simplifying the computations , but also in understanding physically the results .",
    "the idea to decompose a scattering matrix into its physical and irrelevant parts is to notice that the physics of a single scattering event is unchanged under @xmath37-transformations of the ( electron ) basis for the @xmath6 degenerate modes ( separately for outgoing and incoming ones ) in the normal lead .",
    "decompositions following this idea are conventionally referred to as polar decompositions of a scattering matrix when the physical part contains only the transmission eigenvalues @xcite . in the current problem",
    "the same idea gets slightly more complicated by the demand of the phs , which insists that the valid transformations are of the form @xmath38 with @xmath39 . in the majorana basis , if eq .",
    "is also imposed on the transformed operators ( with tildes ) , this means [ eq : tf_mf ] ^(+ ) = ^(+ ) , ^(- ) = ^(- ) , where @xmath40 accordingly the decomposition of @xmath22 is given by @xmath41 when @xmath42 and @xmath43 are properly chosen , @xmath44 contains a minimal number of parameters - 2\\,\\mbox{dim}[u(n ) ] = n$ ] , which turns out to be the actual number of parameters in @xmath44 . ] that are relevant to physical observables , and hence is the canonical form of @xmath22 .    as a consequence of the phs",
    ", the decompositions here do not in general bring @xmath44 into a diagonal form as conventional polar decompositions do ( the diagonal form is even impossible in the electron - hole basis because the @xmath0 mm can not be coupled only to a single electron / hole mode at all ) .",
    "instead the decompositions of @xmath22 turn out to take the form of euler decompositions : mathematically this means @xmath44 appears to be a combination of uncoupled ( 2d-)planar rotations ; physically this means the scattering of many majorana modes is essentially pairwise . in the rest of this section , we will derive such an euler decomposition first in the simplest case when @xmath45 , and then in the arbitrary @xmath6-channel case .      )",

    "namely , @xmath22 is equivalent to a rotation in three dimensions .",
    "such a rotation can be parametrized by three parameters , known as the euler angles , as follows [ eq : euler1 ] s_m = (    cc 1 & 0 + 0 & r ( )    ) (    cc r ( ) & 0 + 0 & 1    ) (    cc 1 & 0 + 0 & r ( )    ) , where [ eq : r0 ] r",
    "( ) (    cc & - + &    ) (= , , ) is a planar rotation by an angle @xmath47 .",
    "the above decomposition is exactly what is dictated by eq . .",
    "to see this , simply notice that [ eq : r0u0 ] u_1^r ( ) u_1 = (    cc e^-i & + & e^i    ) , thus we can identify @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "namely , if we redefine the electron and hole operators by trivial gauge transformations ( in the normal lead ) @xmath50 and redefine @xmath51 according to eq",

    "nevertheless one can show that ( see appendix [ app : dec ] ) , the @xmath55-dimensional majorana scattering matrix can always be decomposed as eq . with [ eq : sm_n ] _ m = 1 , where @xmath56 couples the modes @xmath18 and @xmath52 , @xmath57 with @xmath58 couples the modes @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and the last diagonal entry @xmath33 signifies a complete reflection of mode @xmath61 .",
