    "the expression `` transition '' ( which occurs at the transition temperature @xmath2 ) is used for first / second order phase transitions and crossovers .",
    "( observables change rapidly during a crossover , but no singularities appear . )",
    "extensive experimental work has been done with heavy ion collisions at cern and brookhaven to explore the @xmath1-@xmath0 phase boundary at relatively small @xmath1 values . at large @xmath1",
    "a rich phase structure is conjectured @xcite .",
    "there are well established nonperturbative lattice techniques to study this transition at vanishing density . at @xmath1=0 we have fairly good description of the transition ( e.g. the order of the transition as a function of the quark masses or the the equation of state as a function of t )",

    "new , and for the first time successful approaches appeared and physically relevant results were obtained @xcite .",
    "the aim of this review is to give a self - contained picture on the lattice approach at @xmath1@xmath30 for real qcd ( qcd - like models , such as su(2 ) , random matrix or njl models are not discussed ) . in section 2 the qualitative features of the phase diagram are summarised both at @xmath1=0 and @xmath1@xmath30 .",
    "section 3 briefly presents the lattice formulation and shows the associated sign problem .",
    "the main emphasis is put to the origin of the problem and technical details are not discussed . in section 4 the two new techniques ( the overlap improving multi - parameter reweighting @xcite and the analytic continuation @xcite ) are presented .",
    "readers who are not interested in the origin of the sign problem and in the new techniques should skip section 3 and 4 . in section 5",

    "our knowledge on the phase diagram of qcd at @xmath1=0 and @xmath1@xmath30 is summarized on figure  [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "some ingredients are rigorous lattice results , others are indications from models .",
    "what are the characteristics of the @xmath1@xmath0 phase diagrams , relevant for heavy ion collisions ?",
    "( see the right panel of figure [ fig : schematic ] . )",
    "one of the most interesting features of the phase diagram is a critical endpoint e connecting the first order phase transition line with the crossover region , which separates the low t hadronic and high t quark - gluon plasma phases .",
    "it is a long - standing open question , whether such a critical point exists on the @xmath1-@xmath0 plane , and particularly how to predict theoretically its location @xcite .",
    "let us discuss first the @xmath1=0 case ( see the left panel of figure [ fig : schematic ] ; note , that now we study only those features of the figure , which are relevant for the critical endpoint at @xmath1@xmath30 , for more details see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "universal arguments @xcite and lattice results @xcite indicate that in a hypothetical qcd with a strange ( s ) quark mass ( @xmath6 ) as small as the up ( u ) and down ( d ) quark masses ( @xmath7 ) there would be a first order phase transition at finite @xmath0 ( point in the e ",
    "f region ) . the @xmath8=2 case with small ( but nonvanishing ) u / d quark masses but with @xmath9 there would be no phase transition only an analytical crossover .",
    "this means that between the two extremes there is a critical strange mass ( @xmath10 ) at which one has a second order finite @xmath0 phase transition .",
    "@xmath8=2 + 1 lattice results with two light quarks and @xmath6 around the @xmath2 indicated that @xmath10 is about half of the physical @xmath6 .",
    "thus , in the real world we probably have a crossover .",
    "( clearly , more work is needed to approach the chiral and continuum limits @xcite . )    at nonvanishing @xmath1 , arguments based on a variety of models predict a first order finite @xmath0 phase transition at large @xmath1 . combining the @xmath11 and large @xmath1 informations an interesting picture emerges on the @xmath1-@xmath0 plane . for the physical @xmath6",
    "the first order phase transitions at large @xmath1 should be connected with the crossover on the @xmath11 axis .",
    "this suggests that the phase diagram features a critical endpoint @xmath12 ( with chemical potential @xmath13 and temperature @xmath14 ) , at which the line of first order phase transitions ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) ends @xcite . at this point",
    "the phase transition is of second order and long wavelength fluctuations appear , which results in characteristic experimental consequences , similar to critical opalescence . passing close enough to ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) one expects simultaneous appearance of signatures , which exhibit nonmonotonic dependence on the control parameters @xcite , since one can miss the critical point on either of two sides .",
    "the location of this endpoint is an unambiguous , nonperturbative prediction of the qcd lagrangian .",
    "unfortunately , no _ ab initio _ , lattice work was done earlier to locate the endpoint . only results from models",
    "@xcite were available .",
    "the goal of present @xmath1@xmath30 lattice studies is to determine the phase diagram , to locate the endpoint and also to calculate the equation of state .",

    "the first term gives the gauge , the second one the fermionic contribution . in the discretised lattice formulation",
    "the anti - commuting @xmath18 quark fields live on the sites ( @xmath19 ) of the lattice , whereas the @xmath20 gluon fields are used as link ( @xmath21 ) and as plaquette ( @xmath22 ) variables @xmath23 here @xmath1 represents the direction and @xmath24 the corresponding unit vector . similarly to the continuum formulation the action @xmath25 consists of the pure gluonic and the fermionic parts .",
    "the gluonic part is written with the help of the plaquettes : @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 is the gauge coupling .",
    "the fermionic part on the lattice needs a differencing scheme for quarks . in the naive , noninteractive case one",
    "obtains : @xmath28 .",
    "the interacting case has @xmath29 instead of @xmath30 , thus the gauge field is also included : @xmath31 ( fermion doublers do not play any role in the sign problem , therefore we do not discuss them ) .",
    "fermion fields appear only in bilinear expressions , thus we can write @xmath32 , where m is the @xmath33-dependent fermion matrix . note , that the number of raws or coloumns of m is proportional to the lattice volume . in our case",
    "the matrix m is sparse , only diagonal ( @xmath34 ) and next - neighbour ( @xmath35 ) elements are nonvanishing .",
    "our system can be described by the euclidean partition function .",
    "it is given by integrating the boltzmann weights over the gauge and fermionic fields .",
    "the action is bilinear in the fermionic variables , thus this part of the integral can be calculated explicitely . @xmath36 the remaining integral over the @xmath33 fields",
    "is calculated by stochastic methods .",
    "a canonical ensemble of field configurations is generated by monte - carlo algorithms .",
    "observables are obtained as averages over the field configurations .",
    "the intrinsic feature of these techniques is importance sampling , thus we sample only the most important configurations and these individual configurations have equal weights in the averages .",
    "we use the most straightforward technique , the metropolis algorithm as an illustration ( the metropolis method is very cpu - intensive , thus usually faster but more complicated techniques are used ) .",
    "the basic step of the method is a stochastic , reversible modification of a link variable : @xmath37 .",
    "it is accepted or rejected .",

    "it is easy to show , that by sweeping through the whole lattice many times , we reach the canonical distribution , and physical observables can be determined .",
    "note , that for real gauge fields @xmath40 is real , thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : metropolis ] ) really has a probability interpretation .",
    "this feature is essential not only for the metropolis algorithm , but for any importance sampling based method .",
    "our primary goal is to understand qcd at finite densities . as usual ,",
    "finite densities can be studied by introducing a chemical potential .",
    "one adds the following term to the continuum action : @xmath41 . in this formula @xmath1 acts as a fourth component of an imaginary , constant vector potential @xcite . as we have seen real gauge fields result in real @xmath40",
    "; however , the inclusion of @xmath1 ( thus a constant imaginary gauge field ) gives complex @xmath40 .",
    "this spoils the probability interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : metropolis ] ) and any other importance sampling based method . instead of an ensemble of equally important configurations ( importance sampling ) we might have configurations with complex boltzmann weights .",
    "these complex weights with oscillating real parts largely cancel each other in observables . in the literature",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as the `` sign problem '' .",

    "first one produces an ensemble of qcd configurations at @xmath1=0 and at t@xmath30 .",
    "then the ferrenberg - swendsen type reweighting factors @xcite of these configurations are determined at @xmath1@xmath42 and at a lowered t. the idea can be easily expressed in terms of the partition function @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the action of the gluonic field , @xmath45 fixes the coupling of the strong interactions ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "note that for a given lattice @xmath0 is an increasing function of @xmath47 .",
    "the quark mass parameter is @xmath48 and @xmath49 comes from the integration over the quark fields ( see eq.([eq : part_func ] ) ) . at nonzero @xmath1 one",
    "gets a complex @xmath49 which has no probability interpretation , thus it spoils any importance sampling .",
    "thus , the first line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : reweight ] ) at @xmath1@xmath30 , is rewritten in a way that the first part of the second line is used as an integration measure ( at @xmath1=0 , for which importance sampling works ) and the remaining part in the curly bracket is measured on each configuration and interpreted as a weight factor @xmath50 .",

    "the glasgow - method reweights pure hadronic configurations to transition ones . by the new technique transition ( or hadronic / qgp ) configurations",
    "are reweighted to transition ( or hadronic / qgp ) ones .",
    "since the original ensemble is collected at @xmath1=0 one does not expect that even the new technique is able to describe the physics of the large @xmath1 region with e.g. colour superconductivity .",
    "fortunately , the typical @xmath1 values at present heavy ion accelerators are smaller than the covered region .    an alternative approach @xcite uses taylor expansion of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : reweight],[eq : opexp ] ) as a function of @xmath1 ( or @xmath48 ) and hence estimates the derivatives of various quantities with respect to @xmath1 ( or @xmath48 ) .",
    "thus , for the case of a taylor expansion in @xmath1 one has @xmath54 instead of using the explicit form of the determinants in eq .",
    "( [ eq : reweight ] ) the bielefeld - swansea group used the derivatives in @xmath1 .",
    "compared to the explicit calculation of the determinants , the taylor technique needs less cpu - time ( derivatives can be estimated stochastically ) ; however , only valid for somewhat smaller @xmath1 values than the full technique .",
    "the other promising and absolutely independent approach is the analytic continuation from imaginary to real chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "one computes first the critical line for imaginary chemical potential .",
    "for these @xmath1 values there is no sign problem , therefore monte - carlo simulations based on importance sampling can be carried out .",
    "one can check the convergence of the taylor expansion of the critical line , thus @xmath55 as a function of im(@xmath1 ) .",
    "the convergence seems to be surprisingly fast for the whole range of chemical potentials accessible to this method .",
    "analytic continuation of the taylor series then reduces to simply flipping the sign of the appropriate terms . finally , the infinite volume limit has to be taken from the continued results at real @xmath1 .",
    "using this technique the phase line separating the hadronic and quark - gluon plasma phases were determined @xcite .",
    "the order of the transition can then be determined in a @xmath56-range where the truncation error of the series is smaller than finite size scaling effects .",
