    "long - range beam - beam interactions are known to cause emittance growth or beam loss in the tevatron @xcite and are expected to deteriorate beam quality in the lhc . a possible remedy to reduce their effects",
    "is to increase the crossing angle .",
    "however , it has a side effect of reducing the luminosity due to the reduction in geometric overlap .",
    "compensation of long - range beam - beam interactions by applying external electromagnetic forces has been proposed for the lhc @xcite . at large beam - beam separation , the electromagnetic force",
    "which a beam exerts on individual particles of the other beam is proportional to @xmath0 , which can be generated and canceled out by the magnetic field of a current - carrying wire .",
    "direct - current wires were installed in sps @xcite , da@xmath1ne @xcite , and later in rhic @xcite for tests .",
    "results of the sps wire excitation experiments have been reported earlier @xcite . during the kloe experiment in da@xmath1ne ,",
    "an improvement of beam lifetime without luminosity loss due to the compensation of parasitic collisions has been observed @xcite .",
    "experiments in rhic supplement the sps and da@xmath1ne tests .",
    "the beam lifetime in rhic is typical for a collider storage ring and better than in the other two machines . unlike the sps ,",
    "two beams circulate and interact in rhic and compensation of a single long - range interaction is possible .",
    "the energies and other beam conditions are also different from the sps and da@xmath1ne .",
    "so the results reported here will result in simulations being benchmarked under a wider range of operating conditions .",
    "two current carrying wires , one for each beam , have been installed between the magnets @xmath2 and @xmath3 of ip6 in the rhic tunnel .",
    "their impact on a beam was measured during the physics run with deuteron and gold beams .",
    "no attempt was made to compensate the beam - beam interaction since so far only ion beams were available which have a beam - beam parameter about a factor of 3 smaller than proton beams .",
    "however , the experimental results help to understand the beam - beam effects because the wire force is similar to the long - range beam - beam force at large separations . in this report",
    "we discuss the results of numerical simulations of a wire acting on a beam in rhic using a multi - particle tracking code and compare with measurements in rhic run 7 and 8 @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : the physical models used in the simulation code are described in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the beam and wire parameters are given in section [ sec : parameters ] .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents the simulation results of the effects of the wire on the beam dynamics and the comparison between measurement and simulation results .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in the collider simulation , the two beams moving in opposite direction are represented by macroparticles of which the charge to mass ratio is that of each beam .",
    "the number of macroparticles is much less than the bunch intensity of the beam because even with modern supercomputers it is too time consuming to track 10@xmath4 particles for the number of revolutions of interest .",
    "the macroparticles are generated and loaded with an initial distribution for a specific simulation purpose , for example , six - dimensional gaussian distribution for long - term beam evolution .",
    "the transverse and longitudinal motion of particles is calculated by transfer maps which consist of linear and nonlinear maps . in the simulations , the following nonlinearities",
    "are included : head - on and long - range beam - beam interactions , external electromagnetic force by current carrying wire , multipole errors in the interaction region ( ir ) quadrupole triplets , and sextupoles for chromaticity correction .",
    "the finite bunch length effect of the beam - beam interactions is considered by slicing the beam into several sections in the longitudinal direction and by a synchro - beam map @xcite .",
    "each slice in a beam interacts with particles in the other beam in turn at the collision points .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field of a finite length of wire is calculated using the biot - savart law at the particles betatron amplitude .",
    "the six - dimensional accelerator coordinates @xmath5 are applied , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are horizontal and vertical coordinates , @xmath8 and @xmath9 the trajectory slopes of each coordinates , @xmath10 the longitudinal distance from the synchronous particle , and @xmath11 the momentum deviation from the synchronous energy .",
    "coupling between the transverse planes is included in the transfer map between elements .",
    "we adopt the weak - strong model to treat the beam - beam interactions where one beam is strong and is not affected by the other beam while the other beam is weak and experiences a beam - beam force due to the strong beam during the interactions .",
    "the density distribution of the strong beam is assumed to be gaussian .",
    "it is well known that for a large separation distance @xmath12 at parasitic crossings , the strength of long - range interactions is inversely proportional to the distance .",
    "its effect on a test beam can be compensated by current carrying wires which create just the @xmath0 field .",
    "the advantage of such an approach consists of the simplicity of the method and the possibility to deal with all multipole orders at once . for a finite length of a wire embedded in the middle of a drift length @xmath13 and tilted in pitch and yaw angles",
    ", the transfer map of a wire can be written as @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the tilt of the coordinate system by horizontal and vertical angles @xmath16 to orient the coordinate system parallel to the wire , @xmath17 is the drift map with a length @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the wire kick integrated over a drift length , and @xmath20 represents a shift of the coordinate axes to make the coordinate systems after and before the wire agree .    at the start of the simulation ,",
    "the particles in the weak beam are distributed over the phase space @xmath5 .",
    "the number of particles @xmath21 is limited by the computational power . in order to make the best use of a relatively small number of simulation particles compared to the bunch intensity",
    ", the initial distribution should be optimized .",
    "indeed the initial distribution is very important because a proper choice can reduce the statistical noise in the physical quantities .",
    "the simulation particles are generated in two steps :    1 .",
    "the particle coordinates @xmath22 of particles can be directly generated from the spatial gaussian distribution , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "since the particle coordinates are not correlated , one can generate them by inverse mapping of each cumulative distribution function of horizontal , vertical , and longitudinal gaussian distributions , and together with the bit - reversed sequence to minimize nonphysical correlations @xcite .",
    "2 .   an equilibrium distribution in transverse phase space e.g. in the @xmath25 plane is @xmath26 . since the spatial coordinate @xmath6",
    "is determined at the first step , the slope @xmath8 can be obtained from the random variate @xmath27 of a univariable gaussian , i.e. , @xmath28 .    following the above physical model , a beam - beam simulation code",
    "` bbsimc ` has been developed at fnal over the past few years to study the effects of the machine nonlinearities and the beam - beam interactions @xcite .",
    "if required , time dependent effects such as tune modulation and fluctuation , beam offset modulation and fluctuation , dipole strength fluctuations to mimic rest - gas scattering etc can be included in the model .",
    "the code is under continuous development with the emphasis being on including the important details of an accelerator and the ability to reproduce observations in diagnostic devices . at present",
    ", the code can be used to calculate tune footprints , dynamic apertures , beam transfer functions , frequency diffusion maps , action diffusion coefficients , emittance growth and beam lifetime .",
    "calculation of the last two quantities over the long time scales of interest is time consuming even with modern computer technology . in order to run efficiently on a multiprocessor system ,",
    "the resulting model was implemented by using parallel libraries which are mpi ( interprocessor message passing interface standard ) @xcite , state - of - the - art parallel solver libraries ( portable , extensible toolkit for scientific calculation , petsc ) @xcite , and hdf5 ( hierarchical data format ) @xcite .",
    "the transverse electric field of a round gaussian bunch with transverse rms size @xmath29 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the number of particles and the electric charge in the opposite bunch respectively , and @xmath27 is the radial distance from the center of the beam . at a small radius @xmath33 ,",
    "the field is proportional to @xmath27 and shifts the betatron tune .",
    "this tune shift is characterized by the beam - beam parameter @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the classical radius of the particle , @xmath36 is the normalized emittance . while particles at small @xmath27 undergo a linear tune shift , the particles with @xmath37 experience a @xmath0 force .",
    "the long - range effect is nonlinear and may vary from bunch to bunch if the the bunch pattern is asymmetric .",
    "a current carrying wire generates a magnetic force which is @xmath38 , the same as the long - range beam - beam force at large separations .",
    "the wire current required to compensate a long - range interaction is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the wire current , and @xmath41 its length .",
    "in addition to the wire strength , the phase advance from the location of the wire to the location of the long - range interaction should be small for an effective compensation of the long - range interaction @xcite . in rhic ,",
    "a possible parasitic collision point is near the separation dipole dx magnets near ip6 and ip8 .",
    "there is sufficient space in the straight sections between quadrupoles @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the wires .",
    "the phase advance between the dx magnet and the wire location is 5.7@xmath44 for @xmath45 1 m and is expected to provide effective compensation @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : layout ] ( a ) shows the overall layout of rhic which has two head - on beam - beam collisions at ip6 and ip8 .",
    "the yellow beam revolves in a counter clockwise direction , and the blue beam revolves clockwise .",
    "the elements and the location of the wire at ip6 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] ( b ) .",
    "two wires are currently installed in rhic : one for each beam . in these simulations",
    "the effects of a current carrying wire on a beam have been studied for different rhic runs : gold beam at both injection and store energies , and deuteron beam at store energy .",
    "the parameters of rhic used in our simulations are shown in table [ tab : rhic ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the simulations have studied smaller separations than would be practical in rhic - the large loss rates seen at the smallest separation would have quenched the machine .",
    "however , the simulations show the steep climb in the loss rate beyond a threshold separation and consequently will have a higher power law behavior .",
    "the power law at injection is somewhat higher than at collision but the power laws for gold and deuteron beams are very close despite the large difference in loss rates .",
    "we expect that the power laws depends on the details of the machine and not to be universal . in fact",
    "different power laws have been reported for the sps and the tevatron @xcite .",
    "in order to study the effects of the machine nonlinearities and the beam - beam interactions , including strong localized long - range beam - beam interactions , we have developed a six - dimensional weak - strong code ` bbsimc ` .",
    "machine nonlinearities , beam - beam collisions and the field of a current carrying wire can be included in the model .",
    "we have studied the effects of the wire on the beam dynamics in three different cases : gold beam at injection , gold beam at store , and deuteron beam at store .",
    "results show that the betatron tune change due to the wire is well tracked by the simulation , and that the stability of particle motion is strongly influenced by the wire which causes a significant increase in tune spread and diffusion for both gold and deuteron beam .",
    "tune diffusion with the gold beam and the wire is appreciable only at amplitudes larger than 2 @xmath29 while the tune diffusion with the deuteron beam and the wire is significantly larger extending to the beam core at amplitudes down to 0.5 @xmath29 .    at injection energy , the dynamic aperture",
    "is largely determined by the wire , while the wire and the ir multipoles have a major impact on the stability boundary at collision . with the beam - wire separation only along the vertical axis , it is found that the stability boundary near the vertical axis is linearly proportional to the beam - wire separation .",
    "we observe , from the tune scan of dynamic aperture , that at injection the largest and the smallest dynamic apertures are distributed along a band parallel to the zone along @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively at all wire separations while at collision the largest dynamic apertures are distributed nearly along the diagonal between @xmath48 and @xmath49 . by modeling the stripline kicker we obtain the amplitude and phase angle of the transverse btf .",
    "results show that the betatron tune is well identified by the simulation , and that the wire changes characteristics of the beam response significantly in the horizontal plane , similar to the result for the tune shift .    in simulations",
    "the wire enhances the diffusion .",
    "this effects is particularly pronounced in the plane of the wire , and at amplitudes of about 3 @xmath29 , where the wire can increase the diffusion rate by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the action diffusion for the deuteron beam is larger than for the gold beam , similar to the result for frequency diffusion",
    ". simulations of the beam loss rate when the wire is present are in good agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "the threshold separation at which there is a sharp rise in the loss rates agree to better than 1 @xmath29 .",
    "the loss rates with the deuteron beam are found in measurements and simulations to be nearly an order of magnitude higher than with the gold beam .",
    "comparisons of tune footprints and dynamic apertures of these two cases show no indication that the loss rates may be higher with the deuteron beam and in fact the tune footprint with the deuteron beam is free of low order resonances .",
    "however frequency diffusion and action diffusion with the deuteron beam are substantially higher than with the gold beam implying that these diffusion measures may be better indicators of loss rates .    in this paper simulation results of the beam - wire interactions were compared with measurements taken when the long - range beam - beam interactions were not present .",
    "it is expected that compensation of parasitic interactions using the wires will be tested during the rhic run in 2009 .",
    "we plan to compare simulations with these forthcoming experimental results and also to determine the effectiveness of the compensation of long - range interactions in the lhc .",
    "we thank y. luo and r. calaga for help with the rhic lattice . v. boocha ,",
    "b. erdelyi and v. ranjbar made significant contributions to the development of the code .",
    "some of the parallel computations were performed at the nersc facility at lbl .",
    "this work was supported by the us - larp collaboration which is funded by the us department of energy ."
