    "if the mechanism which is growing in size these galaxies is stochastic ( such as mergers ) , there should exist relic galaxies ( that is , survivors to this size growth ) .",
    "the discovery of relic galaxies is interesting because they are ideal tools for studying galaxy formation , as they remain intact the imprint of their primal properties .",
    "unfortunately , by now only one firm candidate has been reported ( @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the question about which is the best environment for looking for massive relic galaxies arises as an interesting topic .",

    "we consider as massive galaxies those with stellar masses above @xmath0 .",
    "we performed our analysis simultaneously and analogously using simulations and observations .",
    "in particular , we used the simulations from millenium i - wmap7 ( @xcite , which contains 1850648 massive galaxies ) and the observational information from new york university value - added galaxy catalogue ( @xcite , which contains 41716 massive galaxies ) .",
    "we define the environmental density around each galaxy in the simulations and observations in the same way : for each one we identify all its massive neighbours within a sphere of radius @xmath1 , and compute the following formula : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the stellar mass of the @xmath4th neighbour located at less than @xmath5 of the @xmath6th galaxy of the sample ( galaxy @xmath6 has @xmath7 neighbours ) .",
