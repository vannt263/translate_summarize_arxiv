    "growing attention to cdse / cds core / thick shell nanocrystals ( ncs ) initially reported by two groups @xcite is stimulated by their superior optical properties superior to any other nc hetero - structures prepared up to now .",
    "the photoluminescence is never completely quenched in these ncs @xcite and the blinking is almost completely suppressed @xcite . at low temperatures",
    "these structures demonstrate suppression of non - radiative auger recombination @xcite and almost 100% photoluminescence quantum yield @xcite . as a result",
    "these nc structures demonstrate a very low threshold for optically pumped lasing @xcite .",
    "the origin of such outstanding optical properties of the cdse / cds core / thick shell nano - structures ( or giant cdse / cds ncs @xcite ) is not completely understood , but one thing is clear .",
    "the very thick shell always prevents carrier escape to the nc , no matter which mechanism is responsible for this escape : direct quantum mechanical tunneling , thermo - ionization of the ncs , or auger auto - ionization of the ncs , where two electron hole pairs were created simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the prevention of the nc ionization could explain the blinking suppression ; however , it does not explain the suppression of non - radiative auger recombination of charged excitons , biexcitons @xcite and multi - excitons @xcite .",
    "the alloying of the cdse / cds interface in giant cdse / cds ncs could be a reason for auger recombination suppression , as was suggested in several papers of the los alamos group @xcite .",
    "this explanation relies on a theoretical prediction that softening of the carrier confined potential could reduce the auger recombination rate by three orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "indeed , growth of the thick shell in the giant cdse / cds core / shell ncs lasted for a week @xcite .",
    "the slow growth of the shell at temperatures above room temperature suggests that the strong interface diffusion takes place during the nc growth .",
    "the diffusion should lead to alloying adjacent to the surface area and softening of the confinement potential .",
    "this alloying assumption was confirmed recently by the demonstration of mixed phonon replicas in the fluorescence line narrowing ( fln ) of cdse / cds ncs with a thick shell @xcite .",
    "this argument , however , can not be used to explain the suppression of the auger recombination observed by dubertret group @xcite .",
    "the shell of their ncs is grown very fast and that practically excludes any inter - diffusion .",
    "in contrast , the fast growth of the lattice mismatched cdse / cds core / shell ncs should obviously results in some intrinsic strains . indeed , the samples exhibit a phonon spectrum of a pure cdse nc , the frequencies of which are shifted from bulk cdse frequencies due to the compressive strain within the nc @xcite .",
    "an understanding of the unusual and potentially useful properties of the giant cdse / cds core / shell ncs requires a theoretical description of the fine structure of the band edge excitons , and trions . up to now",
    ", the energy spectra of these nc quantum dots were studied only within simplified parabolic band models @xcite , which do not take into account the complex structure of the valence band and the complicated character of inter - particle coulomb interactions .",
    "the theoretical description of the energy spectra of the exciton and exciton complexes in these ncs also has some objective complications , because cdse / cds hetero - structures are not well characterized .",
    "we know that holes are always localized in cdse , and that the valence band offset is no less than 500mev . however , we do nt know the sign of the band - offset of the conduction band nor its magnitude .",
    "a small value of the cdse / cds conduction band offset suggests its complex behavior , because the band offset sign and magnitude should be sensitive to the strain and temperature @xcite .",
    "these qualitative data on the band offset suggest that an exciton created in cdse / cds ncs with a thick cds shell should look like a donor center , where a hole is strongly localized in the cdse core while an electron is attracted to this charged core by the coulomb potential .",
    "if cdse / cds is the type ii hetero - structure , the core potential in the nc pushes the electron into the cds shell . in the opposite case ,",
    "if cdse / cds is the type i heterostucture , the core creates an additional well , which increases the electron localization around the hole .",
    "the temperature dependence of the cdse and cds energy gaps @xcite suggests that a decrease of temperature should favor type i. as a result , a decrease of the temperature increases the exciton binding energy and , consequently , shortens the radiative decay time of excitons , which is controlled by the electron - hole wave function overlap , and increases the dark - bright exciton splitting.@xcite    due to the very strong confinement of holes , the positively charged trion which was observed in the cdse / cds ncs @xcite appears as a doubly - charged donor .",
    "the larger coulomb attraction of the electron to the core should significantly increase the electron binding energy and shorten the radiative decay time .",
    "the negatively charged exciton should look like a negatively charged donor center d@xmath0 .",
    "the binding energy of the second electron in the d@xmath0 center is usually quite small on the order of @xmath1 of the donor binding energy",
    ". this energy will be higher , however , in redthe type i cdse / cds core / shell structure , due to an additional attractive potential ( created by the cdse core ) for an electron .",
    "finally , a biexciton in these structures looks like the helium atom , with two holes localized in the core and two electrons with opposite spins occupying the same orbit .    in this paper",
    ", we have calculated the binding energy and the fine structure of the exciton in cdse / cds ncs with a very thick shell as a function of the cdse / cds conduction band offset and the core radius .",
    "the calculations takes into account the complex structure of the cdse valence band and inter - particle coulomb and exchange interaction .",
    "we have also developed a general theory describing the fine structures and radiative decay time of positively and negatively charged trions . using this theory",
    "we have calculated optical spectra of trions in giant cdse / cds core / shell ncs as a function of conduction - band offset and core radius .    this paper is organized as follows : in section ii and iii we describe the energy spectra and wave functions of one and two holes localized in the cdse core . in section iv we discuss the energy and the wave function of an electron in a central symmetrical potential created by localized holes and the conduction band offset . in section",
