    "the kleinmann - low ( kl ) nebula is a source of extended infrared ( ir ) emission that is located @xmath2 northwest of the trapezium stars in the orion nebula cluster @xcite .",

    "multi - epoch radio observations have revealed an unusually high proper motion @xcite .",
    "members of orion exhibit a dispersion of @xmath6  mas  yr@xmath0 in their proper motions @xcite , whereas bn has a proper motion of 13.5  mas  yr@xmath0 ( 26  km  s@xmath0 ) relative to the cluster @xcite .",
    "runaway young stars may arise from dynamical interactions within multiple systems or small stellar groups @xcite .",
    "because its proper motion is pointed away from the trapezium stars , it has been proposed that bn was ejected 4000 years ago from a multiple system containing the most massive member of the trapezium , @xmath7  ori  c @xcite , which also helps explain some of the properties of that system @xcite .",
    "the proper motion of bn indicates that it may have passed near radio source i @xcite in the kl nebula @xmath1500 years ago .",
    "@xcite suggested that following its ejection from the trapezium , bn passed close enough to source i to trigger the explosive outflow that emanates from the cloud core in the kl nebula @xcite .",
    "kinematic studies of the outflow have found that it did originate in the vicinity of source  i near that time period @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xcite and @xcite proposed that bn , source i , and at least one additional star were members of a multiple system , and the latter two stars formed a tight binary or merged , which resulted in the ejection of bn and the generation of the outflow . that scenario has been supported by the measurement of source i s proper motion , which is in roughly the opposite direction of bn s motion @xcite . based on radio measurements of its proper motion , source n from @xcite",
    "also may have originated from a multiple system with source i and bn @xcite , although its motion is more difficult to reliably measure because of its complex and evolving morphology at radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "previous studies have generally favored the kl nebula rather than the trapezium as the ejection site for bn @xcite .",
    "for instance , bn appears to be younger than the trapezium stars based on its circumstellar material and its ejection from the trapezium and subsequent close encounter with source i would not account for the large motions of i and n. nevertheless , some doubts persist regarding this scenario in which bn was ejected from a multiple system with source i @xcite . it is challenging to explain the presence of the circumstellar disks around bn and sources i and",
    "n if they experienced interactions that were sufficiently close to produce the rapid ejection of bn .",
    "in addition , the mass of source i derived by combining an estimate of bn s mass with conservation of momentum ( @xmath8  @xmath4 ) is higher than the dynamical mass measured from its circumstellar material ( @xmath9  @xmath4 , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the proper motions of bn , source i , and other stars embedded in the kl nebula have been previously measured with multi - epoch radio observations .",
    "however , many young stars in the nebula are not detected in radio surveys , and instead appear only in ir imaging . to search for large motions among those stars ,",
    "we have used high - resolution near - ir images that were obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) in 1998 and 2015 . in this letter , we report the discovery of a high proper motion for source x from @xcite . based on its motion ,",
    "source x likely originated from the same multiple system that produced bn and source i. meanwhile , we find that the proper motion of source  n is inconsistent with participation in that event .",
    "to search for high proper motion stars in the kl nebula that are not detected by radio surveys , we have used images spanning 17 years that were obtained with the near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) and the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 , * ? ? ? * ) on board _",
    "hst_. on 1998 january 12 and 16 ( ut ) , camera 3 of nicmos collected images of the kl nebula in the filters f110w ,",
    "f160w , f164n , f166n , f190n , f212n , and f215n @xcite . on 2015",
    "march 13 ( ut ) , wfc3 observed a much larger portion of the orion nebula cluster , including the entirety of the kl nebula , in the f130n and f139 m filters through treasury program 13826 ( m. robberto , in preparation ) .",
    "the raw images from nicmos and wfc3 had plate scales of approximately @xmath10  pixel@xmath0 and @xmath11  pixel@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "pixel coordinates for point sources in each of the nicmos and wfc3 images were measured with the task _ starfind _ in iraf .",
    "we used astrometry from the near - ir imaging survey of @xcite for stars in our f130n and f139 m wfc3 images to derive offsets in right ascension , declination , and rotation that would align the world coordinate system ( wcs ) of the wfc3 images to the astrometric system utilized by @xcite , which was that of the two micron all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "we measured the wcs of each nicmos image using astrometry of stars derived from those updated wfc3 images .    for each of the two cameras , we computed the average coordinates of each star from among the filters in which it was detected , excluding data in the corners of the nicmos images because of the greater uncertainty in the distortion correction . for each star detected by wfc3",
    ", we then identified the closest matching star in the catalog of sources from nicmos .",
    "proper motions were computed with the matched wfc3 and nicmos coordinates .",
    "we estimated the errors in these motions from the standard deviations of the differences in right ascension and declination between the two epochs .",
    "these estimates are upper limits for the errors since the velocity dispersion among the stars ( @xmath6  mas  yr@xmath0 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also contributes to the dispersion in our proper motion measurements .    among the stars in the vicinity of the kl nebula , source x from @xcite exhibits the largest motion .",
    "its total proper motion is 29  mas  yr@xmath0 , which corresponds to a velocity of 55  km  s@xmath0 at the distance of orion .",
    "foreground field stars often have large proper motions , but source x can not be a foreground star given the high extinction indicated by its red colors ( section  [ sec : phot ] ) .",

    "we did not find any additional stars in the kl nebula with relative proper motions larger than @xmath16 ( @xmath17  mas  yr@xmath0 ) .    as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , some previous studies have reported a fairly large proper motion for source n ( @xmath18,@xmath19  mas  yr@xmath0 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we derive a smaller value of @xmath20,@xmath21  mas  yr@xmath0 , which agrees better with the motion of @xmath22,@xmath23  mas  yr@xmath0 measured from millimeter data by @xcite . in centimeter",
    "continuum images , source  n exhibited two components separated by @xmath24 in early epochs @xcite and appeared as a single elongated object in later data @xcite .",
    "it is unclear which , if any , of the flux peaks in those images correspond to the star , which makes it difficult to reliably measure the star s motion with those data .",

    "since its initial detection at 1.6 and 2.2  by @xcite , source x has been imaged in x - rays @xcite and in bands from 1.611.7  @xcite .",
    "it has exhibited variations of @xmath6  mag among the multiple measurements that are available in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 bands . as a result",
    ", we have adopted the median of the available @xmath28 and @xmath29 colors in which the bands were measured near the same time , and we have adopted the median of the available @xmath27 and @xmath30 data . in table  [ tab : data ] , we have compiled those median values and the ( single ) measurements of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "source x was not detected in the f110w image from nicmos .",
    "we note that @xcite detected methyl formate emission at @xmath35 from source  x. two other stars also appear within 3@xmath36 of that emission peak , so it is unclear whether it is associated with source  x.    we have measured aperture photometry for source x in the wfc3 images using an aperture radius of two pixels and radii of two and five pixels for the inner and outer boundaries of the sky annulus , respectively .",
    "we estimated aperture corrections of 0.166 ( f130n ) and 0.176 ( f139 m ) between those apertures and radii of @xmath37 using bright stars in the wfc3 images .",
    "we applied those corrections and the zero - point vega magnitudes of 21.8258 ( f130n ) and 23.2093 ( f139 m ) for @xmath37 apertures to the photometry of source x. the resulting measurements of @xmath38 and @xmath39 are included in table  [ tab : data ] .    to compare the evolutionary stage of source x to those of bn and source",
    "n , we have plotted their near - ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) in figure  [ fig : sed ] . when using bands that are measured near the same time , the colors of source x are similar to or slightly bluer than those of bn and source n , indicating that source x resembles the latter stars in having high extinction and ir excess emission from circumstellar material . for instance , @xcite classified source x as a candidate protostar based on its red @xmath32 color",
    ". however , source x is much bluer than bn and source n between the wfc3 filters and bands at longer wavelengths , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : sed ] , which indicates that source x probably brightened by a few magnitudes prior to the wfc3 observations .",
    "since spectroscopy has not been previously reported for source  x , we observed it with the near - ir spectrograph spex @xcite at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) on the night of 2017 january 14 .",
    "the instrument was operated in the sxd mode with the @xmath40 slit , which produced data with a resolution of @xmath41 and a wavelength coverage of 0.82.5  .",
    "we collected ten 1  min exposures in an abba pattern along the slit . to facilitate removal of nebular line emission at the location of source  x , we selected a / b positions on the slit that were fairly close to each other ( @xmath42 ) and a position angle for the slit ( @xmath43 ) that minimized contamination from extended h@xmath44 emission @xcite .",
    "the data for source  x were reduced with the spextool package @xcite and corrected for telluric absorption in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "the spectral images in the a and b slit positions were subtracted from each other to remove sky emission . based on the spectra at positions adjacent to source  x along the slit ,",
    "the extended hydrogen and helium emission from the orion nebula was successfully removed , and the remaining emission in the spectrum of source  x should arise from the star . however , because the h@xmath44 emission across the kl nebula varies on small angular scales , our method of sky subtraction produced erroneous negative residuals in the spectrum of source  x at the wavelengths of h@xmath44 lines .",
    "therefore , we have ignored the data at those wavelengths .    the reduced spectrum of source  x from 1.42.4  is shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "little flux was detected at shorter wavelengths .",
    "in addition to the hydrogen and helium emission lines mentioned earlier , the spectrum exhibits several absorption features from metals and co. given the presence of ir excess emission in its sed , these features may be diluted by continuum emission from circumstellar dust . to estimate the spectral type in a way that is independent of such veiling , we have compared the relative strengths of na  i , ca  i , and mg  i at 2.22.3  to those measured from spex data for field dwarfs @xcite and diskless young stars ( m. mcclure , private communication ) .",
    "we arrive at a spectral type of early k for source  x. its spectrum contains continuum veiling according to both samples of standard stars , but the young stars have stronger atomic lines than the dwarfs , so they imply greater veiling . to illustrate one of the better fits , we have included in figure  [ fig : spec ] a comparison of source  x and the young star lkca  19 ( k2 , * ? ? ?",
    "the latter has been artificially veiled to match the strengths of na  i , ca  i , and mg  i in source  x ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the ratio of the co bandhead to the atomic lines is higher in source  x than in the standards , which indicates a lower surface gravity .",
    "the spectral slope of source  x indicates an extinction of @xmath46 based on comparison to the best - fitting veiled standards .",
    "in figure  [ fig : map ] , we plot the positions and proper motion vectors of bn and sources i and x. we have excluded source  n since its proper motion constraints from the _ hst _ images and the millimeter data from @xcite are significantly smaller than the other measurements that had suggested an origin at the same location as bn and source  i @xcite . based on their relative proper motions , bn and source i experienced their closest approach in the year 1475@xmath476 with a projected separation of @xmath4840  au ( 1  @xmath49 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have included in figure  [ fig : map ] the 1  @xmath49 range of allowed paths for each star back to that year .",
    "the estimated location of source  x in 1475 agrees with the initial position for the other two stars , which indicates that it was ejected in the same event as those stars .",
    "source x provides strong evidence that such an event did occur and that bn originated in the kl nebula rather than the trapezium .    if bn and sources i and x were ejected from a multiple system , they should exhibit little net momentum in the rest frame of orion .",
    "a radial velocity measurement is not available for source  x , but we can estimate the net momentum in the plane of the sky with the proper motions .",
    "we adopt 10  @xmath4 for bn based on its luminosity and ionization rate @xcite and 7  @xmath4 for source  i based on the kinematics of its circumstellar material @xcite .",
    "we derive a luminosity of @xmath8  @xmath50 for source  x using its @xmath26-band magnitude , a bolometric correction for an early k star , and the extinction from our spectrum . by combining that luminosity and the temperature corresponding to an early k star ( @xmath51  k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with theoretical evolutionary models @xcite , we estimate a mass of 2.53  @xmath4 for source  x. using these adopted masses and the proper motions , the three stars exhibit a momentum equivalent to a velocity of @xmath52  km  s@xmath0 for the original system in the rest frame of orion , which is comparable to the velocity dispersion of the cluster . by accounting for the kinematics of source x ,",
    "we have resolved the previous discrepancy between the dynamical mass of 7  @xmath4 for source i and the mass of @xmath8  @xmath4 implied by conservation of momentum with bn alone @xcite .",
    "some aspects of the interaction that ejected bn and sources i and x remain unclear , such as how these stars were able to retain or reform their circumstellar disks @xcite and the source of their current kinetic energy . as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , the latter has been previously attributed to the gravitational potential energy released by a pair of stars forming a tight binary or merging , likely in what is now source i. the energy produced by the merger of stars with a total mass of source  i ( e.g. , 1 and 6  @xmath4 ) is an order of magnitude greater than the kinetic energy of the three stars , so that remains a plausible explanation .",
