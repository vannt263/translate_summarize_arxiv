    "in recent years , a large body of evidence suggests that the evolution and properties of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are tightly linked not only to the properties of their hosting galaxies , but also to the environment that these host galaxies inhabit .",
    "the most clear example of this perhaps comes from radio - loud agn , which have long been known to be primarily hosted by giant , massive , elliptical galaxies , which are predominantly found in very dense environments ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in general ,",
    "x - ray agn have also been found to be strongly clustered ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , though x - ray agn out to @xmath12 with harder x - ray spectra , e.g. , type-2 , or obscured x - ray agn , are preferentially found in underdense regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "large redshift surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) and the 2df qso redshift survey ( @xcite ) have enabled detailed studies of optical quasars , and have shown that their clustering was larger in the past in such a way that optically selected quasars seem to be hosted by halos of roughly constant mass , a few times @xmath13 , out to @xmath14 .",
    "the advent of the _ spitzer space telescope _ opened a new , mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) window to agn populations , providing samples that are relatively insensitive to the dust extinction that affects quasar surveys in the optical , ultraviolet ( uv ) and soft x - ray ( @xmath15  kev ) bands .",
    "@xcite developed a simple selection technique based on irac colors that identifies luminous agn essentially independent of their obscuration , and thus is particularly useful for identifying the dominant population of obscured agn that were largely missed in previous surveys ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is the recent launch of the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ ; @xcite ) that has made it possible to efficiently and robustly recover agn over the entire sky , including both unobscured and obscured sources .",
    "the most widely accepted idea about the physical origin of obscuration is the presence of a thick dust torus that , when viewed sideways , blocks the central part of the agn and hides many of the quasar - like features observed in unobscured agn ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first indirect evidence in favor of a torus was the detection of polarized broad emission lines , characteristic of unobscured agn , in a fraction of well known obscured agn due to the scattering toward the line of sight by free electrons just above ( or below ) the torus ( see @xcite ) . as an alternative to orientation - driven or torus models of agn obscuration",
    ", it is also plausible that at least part of obscuration could be caused by the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy or by larger , @xmath0kpc - scale clouds of cool dust ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , galaxy formation simulations by @xcite predict enhanced agn activity after galaxy mergers , which is initially obscured by kpc - scale dust clouds but is later laid bare as agn feedback pushes out the obscuring material .",
    "a basic prediction of the orientation - driven agn unification models is that similarly selected agn should populate similar environments .",
    "while some differences are clearly evident based on intrinsic agn luminosity or radio - loudness ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , the expectation is that obscured ( or type-2 ) and unobscured ( or type-1 ) agn of similar luminosity and radio power should reside in similar environments .",
    "however , relatively little is known about the clustering of obscured agn , particularly those identified at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "@xcite studied the spatial clustering of x - ray agn at @xmath12 , finding no significant difference in clustering strength between obscured and unobscured x - ray selected agn .",
    "similarly , from a matched sample of powerful radio - loud agn at @xmath16 , @xcite found that radio - loud quasars ( e.g. , unobscured radio - loud agn ) reside in similar environments to high - redshift radio galaxies ( e.g. , obscured radio - loud agn ) .",
    "in contrast , @xcite analyzed a sample of 806 _ spitzer _ mid - ir - selected quasars at @xmath17 in the botes field .",
    "they found marginal ( @xmath18 ) evidence that obscured quasars have a larger bias and populate more massive dark matter halos .    these studies ,",
    "while powerful due to the availability of spectroscopic redshifts and/or a large number of photometric bands , suffer the typical limitations of deep pencil - beam surveys , providing samples of a few hundred objects at most . in this paper",
    "we adopt a complementary approach by combining the _ wise _  and sdss data sets over thousands of square degrees .",
    "we select agn based on the _ wise _  3.4  @xmath2 m ( @xmath19 ) and 4.6  @xmath2 m ( @xmath20 ) bands using selection criteria recently developed and demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite . to quantify the clustering",
    ", we undertake a correlation analysis , which is arguably the most powerful method for studying the distribution of galaxies .",
    "the angular correlation function measures the projected clustering of galaxies by comparing the distribution of galaxy pairs relative to that of a random distribution . while a less direct probe than the spatial correlation function , @xmath21 , the angular correlation function is a powerful approach as it can be applied to wide - area surveys and large samples of galaxies , overcoming the limitations of small number statistics and cosmic variance . in this work",
    "we focus on the angular correlation of agn . adopting a preliminary estimate of the redshift distribution of _ wise_-selected agn",
    ", we derive the absolute bias and estimate the typical mass of the dark matter halos that host them .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 we describe the surveys used in this work . in  3 we describe mid - ir selection of agn using the _ wise _  survey and detail the colors , morphologies , and redshift distribution of such sources .",
    "section  4 presents the angular clustering measurements ,  5 presents the results and conclusions , and  6 summarizes these results and discusses the implications of this work .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume a flat concordance @xmath22cdm cosmology , with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . unless otherwise noted , all magnitudes in this paper refer to the vega system .",

    "the _ wise _  satellite mapped the full sky in four bands centered at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22  @xmath2 m ( bands @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively ) , achieving 5-@xmath28 point source sensitivities better than 0.08 , 0.11 , 1 and 6  mjy , respectively .",
    "every part of the sky has been observed typically @xmath29 times , except near the ecliptic poles where the coverage is much higher .",
    "astrometric precision is better than 015 for high signal - to - noise ( snr ) sources ( @xcite ) and the angular resolution is 61 , 64 , 65 and 12@xmath30 for bands ranging from 3.4 to 22  @xmath2 m .",
    "this paper is based on data from the _ wise _",
    "all - sky release , which comprises images and four - band photometry for over 563 million sources , and has been publicly available since march 2012 .",
    "an object is included in this catalog if it : ( 1 ) is detected with snr@xmath315 in at least one of the four bands ; ( 2 ) can be measured well in at least five frames ; and ( 3 ) is not flagged as a spurious artifact in at least one band .",
    "we refer the reader to the _ wise_all - sky release explanatory supplement for further details ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sdss ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is a five - band photometric ( @xmath32 bands ) and spectroscopic survey that has mapped a quarter of the sky , providing photometry , spectra and redshifts for about a million galaxies and quasars , and photometry for many more .",
    "the imaging reaches 50% completeness at @xmath33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sdss pipeline calculates several kinds of magnitudes . in this work",
    "we have adopted the model magnitudes ( _ modelmag _ ) , which perform well for both bright and faint sources and provide unbiased galaxy colors .",
    "magnitudes are corrected for galactic reddening using the dust maps of @xcite .",
    "when appropriate , sdss magnitudes ( nearly in the ab system ) are converted into the vega system using @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is estimated by projecting model stellar spectra into the sdss @xmath36-band filter ( for details , see kcorrect software ) .",
    "in addition , sdss asinh scale magnitudes are converted into pogson logarithmic scale magnitudes ( see sdss website for further details ) .",
    "mid - ir selection of agn relies on distinguishing the characteristic rising power - law agn spectrum from the black body spectrum of stellar populations , which peak at rest - frame 1.6  @xmath2 m .",
    "this means that agn tend to be redder than normal galaxies in the mid - ir .",
    "this was initially shown in _",
    "data where simple irac - band color cuts isolate agn from other galaxy populations at @xmath37 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the _ wise _  survey has proven very efficient in detecting agn using just the two shorter ( and more sensitive ) bands at 3.4  @xmath2 m and 4.6  @xmath2 m ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "using empirical agn and galaxy spectral templates , @xcite showed that even pure agn present typically red @xmath38 colors out to @xmath39 for reasonable values of dilution by the host galaxy light ( e.g. , see fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "heavily extincted agn are of course even redder in @xmath38 .",
    "this contrasts with the bluer @xmath38 colors of : ( 1 ) galactic stars , as only brown dwarfs with spectral types cooler than t5 have @xmath40 ( @xcite ) ; and ( 2 ) normal galaxies out to @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the primary contaminants to the red _ wise _  color selections will be the coolest brown dwarfs , which are quite rare on the sky , and galaxies at @xmath42 , which are effectively eliminated by our brightness cut , @xmath43 .    using _ wise",
    "_  data over the area covered by the cosmos survey , @xcite demonstrated that a simple mid - ir color criterion is extremely robust at selecting agn candidates .",
    "selecting sources with @xmath40 above the 10-@xmath28 flux limit of 0.16  mjy at 4.6  @xmath2 m ( @xmath43 , vega ) identifies a large population of agn that is @xmath095% reliable and nearly 80% complete with respect to the _ spitzer _ agn selection of @xcite .",
    "these criteria identify 62 agn per deg@xmath44 , as compared to the @xmath45 quasars per deg@xmath44 identified by the optical sdss quasar selection algorithm , which is sensitive to agn of similar intrinsic luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "we construct our agn sample by applying the same selection criteria over a much larger area covered by sdss . in our sample , we only allow sources whose @xmath19 and @xmath20 photometry is unaffected by diffraction spikes , scattered light , persistence or optical ghosts ( @xmath46 in both @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "@xcite reports on _ wise _  selection of agn down to @xmath47 in the higher ecliptic latitude , and thus deeper botes field .",
    "we refer the reader to their work for a useful comparison of _ wise _  agn selection at various depths .",
    "we note that , ignoring @xmath38 color for the moment , typical @xmath48 galaxies can be observed by _ wise _  up to @xmath49 at a 5-@xmath28 sensitivity ( @xmath50 ; see fig .  6 of @xcite ) .",
    "with our conservative flux density cut , @xmath51 , only the brightest , several @xmath48 galaxies will be detected by _ wise _  at @xmath52 .    using the selection criteria of @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    ", we selected 176,467 _ wise _  agn candidates over an effective area of 3363  deg@xmath44 ( see  [ sec : mask ] for details about the angular mask ) .",
    "the @xmath54 magnitude cut guarantees that 99.7%  candidates are detected with snr@xmath55 and that 99.98% have snr@xmath56 , while the mean snr@xmath57 of the sample is @xmath45 .",
    "the 176,467 selected agn candidates are cross - matched with the sdss photometric catalog . using a matching radius of 15",
    ", we find 152,672 ( 86.5% ) _ wise _  agn candidates with single optical matches , 6095 ( 3.5% ) sources with two or more sdss counterparts , and 17,700 ( 10.0% ) _ wise _  agn candidates without an optical source listed in the sdss database .",
    "the multiple optical matches are mostly due to spurious detections of large sources split into multiple components or , in a few cases , real interacting galaxy systems . these _ wise _  unresolved close galaxy pairs are on scales @xmath58  deg , well below the spatial scales relevant in this work .",
    "the clustering analysis of galaxies on such small angular scales is beyond of the scope of this paper , as it would require full knowledge of the deblending performance of the sdss and _ wise _  pipelines .",
    "therefore , we focus here on _ wise _  agn candidates with single or no optical counterparts .",
    "note that so far we have not applied any constraints on sdss magnitudes , so that among the 152,672 single _ wise_-sdss matches , about 5% are fainter than the @xmath59 50%-completeness limiting magnitude of sdss , but are nevertheless listed in the sdss catalog . to insure that the _ wise _",
    "agn without sdss counterparts are all real sources and not artifacts , we have visually inspected the _ wise _  and sdss images of 1000 randomly selected objects .",
    "we did not find any artifacts from the inspection .",
    "in addition , figure  [ fig : mask ] shows the equatorial coordinates of all _ wise _  agn considered in this study , as well as the _ wise _  agn lacking optical counterparts in the sdss database . in this latter case , we have closely inspected their spatial distribution projected on the sky .",
    "there are no obvious large scale patterns , suggesting that the lack of an optical identification is intrinsic to the sources , and not related to image artifacts , galactic objects , or large - scale extinction .    finally , to further demonstrate that the _ wise _  agn selection is robustly identifying agn",
    ", we investigate the fraction of _ wise_-selected agn with x - ray counterparts in the 60  ks exposures of the _ xmm - newton _ wide - field ( @xmath60 deg@xmath44 ) survey of the cosmos field ( xmm - cosmos  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite applied a similar method in the botes field using irac 4.5  @xmath2 m and @xmath67-band photometry to differentiate obscured and unobscured agn . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "we note , however , that there is no rigorous and unique definition to differentiate obscured and unobscured agn across all wavelengths .    in this work ,",
    "we divide the _ wise _  agn sample according to @xmath68 color .",
    "figure  [ fig : rw2_w1w2 ] illustrates that agn show a bimodal color distribution that separates two populations of agn .",
    "those with colors redder than @xmath69 are , of course , optically faint ( or undetected in sdss ) , but nevertheless well detected at 4.6  @xmath2 m .",
    "we call these `` red agn '' , in contrast with `` blue agn '' that are relatively bright at both mid - ir and optical wavelengths .",
    "we fold agn lacking optical matches into the red agn sample .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the red population is more closely associated with type-2 agn , while the blue population is associated with type-1 agn , e.g. , agn presenting broad emission lines in optical spectroscopy . in total , about 60,000 sources are selected as red agn candidates , implying a type-1 fraction of roughly 55% , similar to the fraction found by @xcite for luminous agn with bolometric luminosities exceeding a few times 10@xmath70  erg  s@xmath71 . in  [ sec : zdist_sel ] we evaluate the model selection function of red and blue agn to test the reliability of the @xmath68 criteria to separate type-1 and type-2 agn .",
    "figure  [ fig : w2magdist ] ( top panel ) shows the @xmath20 magnitude distribution of red and blue _ wise_-selected agn .",
    "although red agn seem slightly fainter at mid - ir wavelengths in general , both subsamples have similar distributions , suggesting there is no strong bias due to the @xmath68 color cut .",
    "the bottom panel shows the distribution of sdss @xmath36-band magnitudes ( corrected for galactic reddening , converted to vega and in the pogson scale ) .",
    "blue agn are considerable brighter , peaking at @xmath72 and falling steeply at @xmath73 .",
    "most red agn are fainter , peaking around @xmath74 and extending to fainter magnitudes , beyond the nominal sdss completeness limit . a considerable fraction ( 10% ) of _ wise _",
    "agn candidates are simply undetected by sdss ; we indicate such sources with a single bin at @xmath75 .",
    "the botes field has considerably deeper @xmath67-band photometry available , reaching @xmath76 ( 5-@xmath28 , point source ; @xcite ) .",

    "wise_-selected agn in botes .",
    "their @xmath67-band magnitude distribution peaks at @xmath77 ( gray line ) with all sources having optical counterparts .",
    "this again illustrates the optical faintness , but detectability of essentially all _ wise_-selected agn .",

    "optical morphologies offer an additional observable with which to investigate the _ wise _  agn selection .",
    "luminous , unobscured , or type-1 agn are typically unresolved at optical wavelengths , which was one of their foundational attributes that led to the name `` quasar '' , or quasi - stellar radio source .",
    "we have known for several decades now that only @xmath87 of quasars are radio - loud , with little variation in this fraction with either redshift or optical luminosity , at least at the high luminosity end ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , mid - ir selection is showing that unresolved , unobscured quasars represent a minority population of luminous agn . indeed , using the sdss type flag to discriminate morphologies , we find only @xmath88 of the _ wise_-selected agn considered in this paper are classified as unresolved point sources .",
    "we use the cosmos field to characterize how morphology depends on optical - to - mid - ir color for _ wise_-selected agn .",

    "fifteen of the sources are undetected by sdss in the @xmath36-band , and are simply plotted at @xmath89 ; all 15 of these sources are detected in the deeper _ hst _ @xmath83 imaging and are spatially resolved .",
    "indeed , of the 28 red agn candidates with @xmath5 , only 1 ( 4% ) is unresolved .",
    "this supports our expectation that red optical - to - mid - ir colors select a clean sample of obscured agn with little contamination from unobscured agn .    of the 54 blue agn candidates , 35 ( 65% ) are unresolved .",
    "figure  [ fig : morph_z_rw2 ] shows the @xmath68 color vs. redshift for these blue agn candidates , with symbols indicating their _ hst _ morphologies . as we will show in the next section , most of the resolved agn ",
    "e.g. , likely obscured agn contaminating our blue agn selection  are at lower redshift ( @xmath90 ) and , in fact , reside in the redder end of our blue agn selection .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : morph_hist ] also clearly shows that it is not feasible to simply make a bluer @xmath68 cut to separate obscured ( e.g. , resolved ) and unobscured ( e.g. , unresolved ) agn .    to characterize the host galaxies of _ wise_-selected candidates we performed more detailed visual classifications on the _ hst _ acs image cutouts ( independently by three of the four authors ; as we agreed for the majority of objects , we report the average here ) .",
    "for red agn , we find that 54% ( 15 ) are disk galaxies or interacting systems , 32% ( 9 ) are elliptical or point sources , and the remaining 14% ( 4 ) have uncertain morphology .",
    "this contrasts with blue agn , where we find that 20% ( 11 ) are disk galaxies and 80% ( 43 ) are either point sources ( most ) or ellipticals .",
    "these results are consistent with the work of @xcite , who studied the morphology of agn in cosmos selected at radio , x - ray and mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "that work found that the red mid - ir - selected agn consist of 63% disk galaxiess , 22% point sources / ellipticals , and 15% other morphology , while the blue agn consist of 15% disk galaxies and 85% point sources / ellipticals .",
    "the main conclusion we wish to draw here is that given its high fraction of disk galaxies , the red agn sample is not dominated by typical red sequence galaxies .",
    "in fact , the red agn have a higher fraction of disk galaxies than the blue agn . as further discussed in  [ sec : hostgal ] , this suggests it is unlikely that a bias in host galaxy type ( favoring red agn in early - type hosts and blue agn in late - type hosts ) could have a large impact in the interpretation of the clustering results presented in ",
    "[ sec : clust_results ] .      given the difference in optical flux introduced by the @xmath68 cut , it is not unreasonable to expected differences in the redshift distribution of blue and red agn . in order to understand the redshift distribution and properties of _ wise _  agn candidates , we have matched our list to publicly available spectroscopy in the cosmos field as well as recent spectroscopic observations ( see @xcite for details about the compiled list of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : zhist ] shows the redshift distribution of the 112 _ wise_-selected agn available in cosmos , of which 88 have spectroscopic redshifts and 11 have photometric redshifts ( plus 13 objects with no redshift information available ) .",
    "the top panel highlights the blue agn ( @xmath80 ) , including five sources , plotted at @xmath91 , that lack both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts .",
    "the distribution peaks around @xmath92 and extends up to @xmath93 , with most of the sources at @xmath94 .",
    "there is an indication of a second smaller peak at @xmath95 , most probably ( as we will see later ) due to type-2 agn that enter into the redder part of our blue sample selection at low redshift . for reference",
    ", we also show the spectroscopic redshifts of 536 _ wise _  agn candidates within the botes field ( dashed histogram ) , obtained from the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages ; @xcite ) .",
    "this survey has different completeness levels for different galaxy samples ( @xmath96 for galaxies , @xmath97 for agn , but with varying priority levels based on their brightness at mid - ir , @xmath98 m , radio , and x - ray energies ) and therefore a complicated redshift selection function .",
    "however , considering the differences in target selection as compared to cosmos ( which essentially targeted every source to @xmath99 ) , the two distributions agree remarkably well .",
    "this suggests that both are not far from the true redshift distribution of _ wise_-selected agn with blue @xmath68 colors .",
    "the bottom panel in figure  [ fig : zhist ] shows the corresponding distributions for _ wise_-selected agn with red @xmath68 colors , including eight sources lacking both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts plotted at @xmath100 .",
    "red agn candidates peak at lower redshift , around @xmath101 , and extend up to @xmath102 .",
    "again , the agreement with ages redshifts in the botes field is notable .    to further understand the nature of the differences in redshift among the red and blue agn samples , we model their selection function by constructing mock objects using the agn and galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) templates from @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath103 quantifies the fraction of the bolometric luminosity coming from the agn component ( see @xcite , 2013 for details ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ahat ] shows whether an object with a given host galaxy type ( e or i m ) , @xmath104 value , and reddening towards the accretion disk , parametrized by @xmath105 , would be targeted as a blue agn ( @xmath80 , blue region ) , as a red agn ( @xmath5 , red region ) , or as an inactive galaxy ( @xmath106 , white region ) . as expected , at low @xmath104 , most systems are characterized as normal galaxies .",
    "the panels at @xmath107 and @xmath108 highlight the extreme cases of a zero reddening or a heavily extincted agn ; the typical boundary between type-1 and type-2 agn corresponds to a reddening of @xmath109 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the gray hatched area marks the region where _ wise _",
    "is not sensitive due to the shallowness imposed by our @xmath43 flux density requirement , namely @xmath52 host - galaxy dominated objects .",
    "this figure shows that while it is very unlikely to misclassify a blue agn as a red one , the opposite happens for a significant fraction of parameter space , suggesting that our red agn selection constitutes a reliable yet incomplete type-2 agn sample , while our blue sample consists of a mixture of type-1 and type-2 agn .",
    "we also used the deep , multi - wavelength data available in the botes field to do detailed sed modeling of _ wise_-selected agn and explore how reddening relates to @xmath68 color for blue and red agn candidates as a function of redshift .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : reddz ] .",
    "the reddening parameter @xmath105 is derived by fitting the agn and galaxy sed templates of @xcite .",

    "the distributions of @xmath104 are strongly peaked toward high values , with most red agn above @xmath111 , and a minor fraction of blue agn with @xmath112 .",
    "this means that while the blue area in the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : ahat ] is large , only a minority of sources could be potentially biased due to the galaxy host type ( i.e. selected as blue agn due to the presence of i m galaxy host ) .",

    "we begin our analysis by exploring the angular clustering for the full sample of agn selected by _",

    "these slight differences are not entirely surprising considering the very different agn selection criteria and the fact that the _ wise _  agn sample includes both obscured and unobscured agn , while the optical quasar samples are entirely comprised of broad - lined , type-1 agn .",
    "furthermore , the clustering of quasars might not be properly represented by a single power law .    at scales below @xmath167",
    ", we find that redder agn have slightly higher angular clustering .",
    "this is interesting considering that this scale ( @xmath168  mpc ) marks the transition between the 1-halo and 2-halo terms , which , in the framework of halo clustering models , arises from galaxy pairs located in either the same or in two different halos , respectively .",
    "as shown at the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : acf_w1w2 ] , the absolute bias for _ wise_-selected agn with @xmath40 with respect to the underlying dark matter distribution is @xmath169 , as compared to @xmath170 for _ wise_-selected agn with redder mid - ir colors , @xmath171 . taking into account the caveat that different redshift and luminosity distributions can possibly bias the results ,",
    "the simplest interpretation is that redder agn are hosted by slightly more massive dark matter halos . for type-1 agn at @xmath172",
    "previous work has shown that the clustering depends only weakly on redshift , luminosity or color ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , for type-2 agn this is mostly unknown and our @xmath173 sample is expected to be a mixture of both type-1 and type-2 agn .",
    "finally , we note that our results compare well to the bias estimates obtained by @xcite for optical quasars over a similarly broad redshift range centered at @xmath174 .",
    "we explore now the angular clustering of _ wise_-selected red and blue agn .",
    "the corresponding correlation functions , shown in figure  [ fig : acf_rw2 ] , display very different amplitudes . for a fixed slope @xmath175 ( that of the entire agn sample ) , blue , or unobscured agn ( e.g. , @xmath80 )",
    "have @xmath176 , while red , or obscured agn ( e.g. , @xmath5 ) have @xmath177 , i.e. , a factor of @xmath178 larger .",
    "the bottom panel shows that the mean bias of obscured sources relative to the dark matter is @xmath7 , as compared to @xmath10 for unobscured agn . for reference",
    ", we also show in figure  [ fig : acf_rw2 ] the angular clustering of type-1 quasars ( grey shaded area ) from @xcite , which is in broad agreement with our estimation for the blue agn sample .",
    "part of the difference in clustering strength could , in principle , be due to the obscured sources having a different selection , that is , since obscured sources are required to be optically faint ( or undetected ) , they could reside at slightly higher redshifts than their unobscured cousins .",
    "on the contrary , spectroscopy from both cosmos and botes demonstrates that red agn tend to be at slightly lower redshift ( figure  [ fig : zhist ] ) .",
    "the caveat is that there is a @xmath179 incompleteness in the two spectroscopic samples and the sample sizes are not extremely large .",
    "while directly comparing the full and complete redshift distributions for blue and red _ wise_-selected agn would be ideal to check whether their different clustering strengths are related to different redshift distributions , we can nevertheless minimize it by selecting agn limited only to those with @xmath180 counterparts in sdss .",
    "the amplitudes of the best - fit power - law become @xmath181 for obscured agn , compared to @xmath182 for unobscured agn , for a fixed slope @xmath175 .",
    "figure  [ fig : acf_rw2_r23 ] shows the corresponding angular auto - correlations , illustrating once again that , while noisier , obscured agn have a correlation amplitude a factor of @xmath60 larger than the unobscured sources .",
    "given the difference in amplitude between the correlation functions of red and blue agn , we investigate how this reflects into the masses of dark matter halos that host them . using the prescriptions described in ",
    "[ sec : halomass ] , we estimate that blue agn at @xmath183 are hosted in halos of characteristic mass @xmath184 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the halo mass of @xmath185 reported by @xcite for sdss optical quasars at @xmath186 .",
    "@xcite finds a similar value of @xmath187 for 2qz quasars hosts . in figure",
    "[ fig : biasz ] we show the bias as function of redshift for the best - fit model ( thick blue line ) , along with models of constant halo mass ( dashed black lines ) for reference .",
    "we find that the halos of our red agn have a much larger characteristic mass of @xmath188 , i.e. over a factor of 10 larger than for blue agn .",
    "we discuss the physical implications of this result in the following section .",
    "we also note that @xcite reports a very similar mass of @xmath189 for their obscured quasar sample , though their value of @xmath190 for unobscured quasars is slightly larger than both our value and literature results for optically selected unobscured quasars .      to understand the clustering result of our red and blue samples , we study the host galaxies of _ wise_-selected agn using sed fitting and the morphology classifications discussed in ",
    "[ sec : morph ] .",
    "this is important because the observed difference in clustering might , in principle , be attributed to a selection effect that biases our red agn sample to being hosted by early - type galaxies and our blue agn to being hosted by late - type galaxies .",
    "such a difference might either be the result of an intrinsic difference between the populations or due to a selection function bias .",
    "in particular , figure [ fig : ahat ] suggests that our red agn sample could be biased against type-2 quasars in starburst galaxies if mid - ir selected agn had a large spread over  values .",
    "first , we use the sed fitting of _ wise_-selected agn candidates in the botes field with the templates of @xcite to analyze the distribution of host light coming from each of the three galaxy templates ( e , sbc and i m ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : reddz ] , the blue agn sample contains some sources with considerable dust obscuration ( i.e. , well above the @xmath109 boundary line ) . for these misclassified type-2 agn , we find that 38% , 36% and 26% of their host galaxy emission is dominated by the e , sbc and i m templates , respectively , where we define an object to be dominated when @xmath3150% of the host luminosity is coming from a given template .",
    "these similar proportions suggest that this selection bias , if present , is not preferentially missing i m galaxies , and therefore it is unlikely to be significantly affecting our results . for completeness , we note that it is difficult to determine the dominant host for the majority of blue candidates which have @xmath191 and thus agn emission dominates the optical sed , making host sed fitting challenging .",
    "the same analysis for red agn candidates in botes gives 63% , 13% and 24% of the cases dominated by e , sbc and i m templates , respectively .",
    "we note here that an e galaxy sed template does not directly imply that the galaxy morphology is elliptical .",
    "as discussed below , sources with the e - type template also include spiral galaxies with prominent bulges .",
    "overall , there is also a large fraction of objects ( 37% if we combine sbc and i m ) dominated by late - type templates , suggesting that while early - type hosts are common , the red agn population is hosted by a mixture of galaxy types .",
    "second , we recall the morphological results from  [ sec : morph ] .",
    "there we found that 54% ( 20% ) of red ( blue ) agn have disks , while 32% ( 80% ) are elliptical or point sources .",
    "this means that the red agn sample is not dominated by typical red sequence galaxies , and that blue agn have , in fact , a lower fraction of late - types than red agn .",
    "these findings strongly suggest that it is unlikely that the clustering results are driven by host galaxy differences or selection bias .",
    "instead , the observed differences in their correlation functions actually represents an intrinsic difference in the environments of type-1 and type-2 agn .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , the increase in clustering while moving from blue cloud to red sequence galaxies is markedly smaller than the difference between blue and red agn .      as the amplitude of @xmath113 will certainly change depending on the location and shape of the redshift distribution in any observed sample of galaxies , it is important to assess how sensitive our bias estimates are to changes in the redshift distribution .",
    "for this purpose we fit different model distributions for red and blue agn redshifts and investigate how much the inferred absolute bias would change by systematically varying the distribution parameters with respect to the best - fitting case . to describe our redshifts , we adopt the gamma statistical distribution of parameters @xmath192 ( shape ) and @xmath193 ( scale ) , although this choice is not critical ( e.g. using gaussians will lead to variations of the same order of magnitude ) . for red agn",
    "the best - fit parameters to observed cosmos redshifts are @xmath194 and @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) , while for blue agn we obtain @xmath197 and @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) .    for our red agn sample , in figure [ fig : varbias_red ]",
    "we reproduce the different model distributions with varying @xmath192 ( top row ) and @xmath193 ( bottom row ) , and the corresponding effect on the bias , always normalized to the best - fitting case highlighted in red .",
    "changing @xmath192 or @xmath193 within the range shown means that the bias could change by @xmath020% at most .",
    "note that to estimate @xmath200 we assume a spatial correlation length @xmath201 that is constant in redshift .",
    "figure [ fig : varbias_blue ] shows the same analysis applied to our blue agn sample .",
    "the result is a similar variation of @xmath025% in bias .",
    "in addition , we also test the effect of fitting a double gamma distribution ( dashed red line ) instead of a single one .",
    "as expected , adding a second peak to the model naturally adjusts much better to the observed redshifts , yet the derived bias would decrease by only @xmath06% . to further assess these conclusions , we repeated the test by directly convolving the cosmos redshift distributions of blue and red agn with a gaussian kernel of increasing width .",
    "once again the bias changes by about 30% for any reasonable broadening .",
    "note that adopting the botes redshift distributions as reference instead of cosmos shifts these percentages by @xmath2024% , and so does not qualitatively alter our conclusions .",
    "finally , a bias uncertainty of @xmath203% in the _ least favorable _ scenario  e.g. , the blue agn bias is underestimated by 20% , while the red agn bias is overestimated by 20%  still translates into systematic halo mass estimates a factor of @xmath204 larger for red agn than for blue agn .",
    "in this work we have taken advantage of recently released data from _ wise _  to construct a large sample of @xmath205 mid - ir - selected agn candidates with the main purpose of analyzing their angular clustering properties . the selection is highly reliable ( @xmath3 ) , as demonstrated in @xcite and @xcite , as well as by the high rate of x - ray detections (  3.1 ) .",
    "the median redshift of the sample is @xmath206 based on relatively complete spectroscopy in the cosmos and botes fields . by considering their optical counterparts from sdss , we distinguish those _ wise_-selected agn that are optically faint , and thus have red optical - to - mid - ir colors and are inferred to be heavily obscured agn , from those that are optically bright , and thus have blue optical - to - mid - ir colors and are inferred to be unobscured agn .",
    "we find that , as a whole , the _ wise_-selected agn population presents a similar clustering strength to optically selected quasars at comparable redshifts , with a slightly higher absolute bias with respect to the dark matter distribution for redder @xmath38 subsamples .",
    "we find that the red agn show a notably larger bias level than that of blue agn , with @xmath7 versus @xmath207 respectively .",
    "using a significantly smaller sample of few hundred sources over a much smaller area , @xcite reported a similar absolute bias of @xmath208 for obscured _ spitzer_-selected agn .",
    "our absolute bias estimates suggest that red agn ( _ i.e _ obscured sources ) are hosted by massive dark matter halos of @xmath209 , well above the halos of mass @xmath11 that harbor blue agn ( unobscured sources ) .",
    "it is possible to interpret these results in a scenario where , at least during a brief phase before the dust is removed and the agn gets `` exposed '' , the black hole mass is a factor of few below the @xmath210 relation of active galaxies . for our sample , from the sed fits of _ wise _  agn in botes we find that both red and blue agn have similar distributions of agn bolometric luminosity , with a nearly identical mean of @xmath211 .",
    "this suggests that the black hole masses of our red and blue agn do not differ much , and it is unlikely that their relative eddington ratio is much different from unity .",
    "moreover , their high luminosities are indicative of quasar - like accretion happening in both samples and we know that _ wise _",
    "agn selection tends to pick up agn radiating at large fractions of their eddington limits ( @xcite ) .",
    "since we find that obscured sources are hosted by more massive halos , then this means that , at least during a period of time , the black hole mass growth lags behind that of the hosting halos and hence the black holes in obscured agn are temporarily `` undermassive '' until they reach their final mass .",
    "this is not entirely surprising , as , for example , @xcite find that submillimeter galaxies at @xmath212 host black holes @xmath29 times smaller than the expected for radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "the basis of such a lag argument for agn has been proposed before in the literature ( e.g. , theoretically by @xcite , and coupled to clustering by @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggests that the effect of rayleigh - taylor instabilities on the eddington outflows that regulate black hole growth leads to black holes masses in active galaxies a factor a few below the m-@xmath28 relation , assuming an observed agn phase represents a black hole growth phase .",
    "thus , agn should recurrently reach eddington - order luminosities in order to grow fast enough to reach the masses specified by the @xcite relation .",
    "one popular scenario for obscured quasars is that they represent an early evolutionary stage of rapid black hole growth just before the emergence of an unobscured , optical quasar . @xcite",
    "pose that in the final stages of coalescence of the galaxies , massive inflows supply large amounts of gas , increasing the gas density around nuclear regions and feeding the black hole that : ( 1 ) initially is obscured , ( 2 ) grows accordingly at high eddington rates , and ( 3 ) is small compared to the spheroid in formation . then",
    ", any possible link between ( final ) black hole mass and halo mass ( e.g. @xcite ) would predict dm halos of the same mass for obscured and unobscured sources .",
    "but , if obscured agn are an early stage where black holes are acquiring their final mass , then they would inhabit more massive halos when compared to unobscured quasars of the same black hole mass .",
    "the clustering of red and blue galaxies has been studied in detail by @xcite using deep2 survey data .",
    "they find that at @xmath213 the bias of blue cloud galaxies is in the range of @xmath214 .",
    "moving towards the red sequence , the bias increases in about 30% , so the measured bias of red galaxies is @xmath215 .",
    "our blue agn candidates have a bias that is at least comparable to luminous blue deep2 galaxies or to their less luminous red galaxies , but the bias of _ wise _  red agn is much larger than that of red galaxies , and is well more than 30% greater than that of blue agn .",
    "this suggests that our red agn candidates do not seem to cluster like typical red sequence galaxies at these redshifts and that the change in clustering is intrinsic to the two agn types .",
    "these results are in broad agreement with @xcite , who finds that mid - ir - selected agn tend to reside in galaxies slightly bluer than the green valley ; and with @xcite , who conclude that the x - ray and mid - ir agn are not dominated by early - type galaxies , but by later - type galaxies with disks .",
    "finally , our results allow to test a basic assumption of the agn unification paradigm .",
    "a fundamental prediction of orientation - driven agn unification models is that the angular clustering strength should be similar for obscured and unobscured agn .",
    "we find evidence that obscured agn are , in fact , more clustered than unobscured sources , which would appear to make simple orientation , or obscuring torus scenarios much less plausible , or , at least , not the full story for agn obscuration . alternatively , it would be interesting to compare our results against predictions of more physical agn models , where , for example , the sublimation radius changes with agn power or the covering fraction depends on other physical parameters . our data set",
    "does not allow us to test these models in detail , but larger samples with improved redshifts and spectral coverage will make it possible . our primary result is a significant difference in the clustering of optically bright ( blue ) and optically faint ( red ) mid - ir - selected agn , implying that , on average , obscured and unobscured agn reside in different halos .",
    "this surprising result has important implications for agn unification , the role of agn feedback in galaxy formation , the lifetime of quasars , and for understanding the sources responsible for the cosmic x - ray background and their cosmic evolution .",

    "<S> we calculate the angular correlation function for a sample of @xmath0170,000 agn extracted from the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ ) catalog , selected to have red mid - ir colors ( @xmath1 ) and 4.6  @xmath2 m flux densities brighter than 0.14  mjy ) . the sample is expected to be @xmath3 reliable at identifying agn , and to have a mean redshift of @xmath4 . in total , the angular clustering of _ wise _  agn is roughly similar to that of optical agn . </S>",
    "<S> we cross - match these objects with the photometric sdss catalog and distinguish obscured sources with @xmath5 from bluer , unobscured agn . obscured sources present a higher clustering signal than unobscured sources . </S>",
    "<S> since the host galaxy morphologies of obscured agn are not typical red sequence elliptical galaxies and show disks in many cases , it is unlikely that the increased clustering strength of the obscured population is driven by a host galaxy segregation bias . by using relatively complete redshift distributions from the cosmos survey , we find obscured sources at @xmath6 have a bias of @xmath7 and are hosted in dark matter halos with a typical mass of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , unobscured agn at @xmath9 have a bias of @xmath10 and inhabit halos of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> these findings suggest that obscured agn inhabit denser environments than unobscured agn , and are difficult to reconcile with the simplest agn unification models , where obscuration is driven solely by orientation . </S>"
