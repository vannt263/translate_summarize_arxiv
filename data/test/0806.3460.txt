    "gas cooling plays a key role in galaxy formation . according to the hierarchical structure formation model , galaxies form in gravitationally collapsed dark matter halos .",
    "the dissipative baryonic matter cools by emitting radiation and condenses into halos to form galaxies @xcite .",
    "subsequently stars form through the radiative cooling of interstellar medium ( ism ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the cooling rate of gas varies with its chemical abundance , because different atoms and molecules have different cooling rates .",
    "the chemical abundance of cosmic gas evolves as a function of time and environment . in the early universe , the primordial gas consists of mainly hydrogen ( mass fraction of @xmath3 ) and helium ( mass fraction of @xmath4 ) with a negligible amount of light metals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . throughout this paper ,",
    "all the elements heavier than helium are collectively called ` metals ' .",
    "most metals are produced inside stars and spread out to the space by galactic winds driven by supernova ( sn ) explosions . in the metal - enriched gas , the total cooling rate",
    "is significantly enhanced relative to that of the primordial gas by the atomic emission lines from recombination of ionised metals .",
    "metals may influence galaxy formation in two different ways .",
    "firstly , the sf efficiency is increased owing to the shorter gas cooling time .",
    "star formation generally takes place in dusty metal - enriched ism , therefore , the enhanced cooling rate by metals would boost up the sf efficiency .",
    "however , the energy / momentum feedback by sne may suppress the subsequent star formation after the initial starburst by heating up the ambient gas .",
    "this complicates the situation , and it is not clear whether the net effect of metal cooling and sn feedback would be negative or positive .",
    "the feedback process is highly nonlinear , therefore , a direct numerical simulation would be a useful tool to explore the effects of feedback and metal cooling .",
    "secondly , the metals dispersed into the igm by sn feedback also enhance the cooling of igm .",
    "this can lead to the increase of igm accretion onto galaxies , because colder gas can sink into galaxies more easily . both of the above two effects may affect the galaxy growth and cosmic sf history significantly .",
    "therefore it is essential to include the effects of metal cooling and chemical enrichment by feedback in the studies of galaxy formation and evolution , and capture the complex two - way interactions between galaxies and igm .",
    "in addition , metal enrichment also affects the equation of state by altering the mean molecular weight of gas , which influences the hydrodynamic calculation of gas thermal state .",

    "most of these works included the treatments of radiative cooling by h & he , star formation , and sn feedback .",
    "however , some of the simulations did not include the effects of metal cooling and/or chemical enrichment by galactic wind .",
    "furthermore , the effects of metal cooling on galaxy growth and cosmic sf history has not been explored in detail using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and presented in the literature , as it is costly to run large cosmological simulations with and without the effect of metal cooling .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effects of metal cooling and metal enrichment on galaxy growth and cosmic sf history using a series of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with and without metal cooling .",
    "the aim of this paper is to single out the effects of metal cooling among our simulations .",
    "this work can be regarded as our initial step towards the long - term goal of developing more complete cosmological hydrodynamic code with physically motivated models of star formation and feedback .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : method ] , we describe our simulation method focusing on how we implement the metal cooling . in   [ sec : global ] , we study the metal cooling effects on the global properties , such as cosmic sfr , phase space ( @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 ) distribution of gas , and the evolution of four phases ( hot , warm - hot , diffuse , and condensed ) of baryons .",
    "we then study the galaxy mass functions (   [ sec : mf ] ) and gas mass fractions (   [ sec : gasfrac ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss and summarise our findings in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we use the updated version of the tree - particle - mesh ( treepm ) smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget-2 @xcite for our cosmological simulations .",
    "the gravitational dynamics is computed by a treepm algorithm , which uses a particle - mesh method @xcite for the long - range gravitational force and a tree method for the short - range gravitational force @xcite .",
    "this hybrid algorithm makes the gravitational force calculation faster than a tree method and allows better force resolution than a pm method in dense regions .",
    "the gas dynamics is computed by an sph method .",
    "the sph is particularly useful if the simulation needs to resolve large dynamical range , which is an inevitable requirement for the study of galaxy formation in a cosmological context .",
    "therefore a treepm - sph simulation can provide a fast and high resolution calculation for both gravitational dynamics and hydrodynamics .",
    "the gadget-2 code adopts the entropy - conservative formulation @xcite , which alleviates the overcooling problem that previous sph codes suffered from .",
    "our basic simulations include radiative cooling and heating processes for hydrogen and helium using a method similar to @xcite .",
    "an external uv background radiation is treated as a spatially uniform photoionising radiation @xcite , and modified to match the ly@xmath7 forest observations @xcite .",
    "implementing star formation and feedback from first principles is not feasible in current cosmological simulations , because the spatial & mass - scales of molecular clouds are not resolved .",
    "star formation and sn feedback are represented by the subgrid multiphase ism model developed by @xcite . in the multiphase scheme ,",
    "a single gas particle represents both hot and cold gas .",
    "the stars are formed in the cold portion when the density exceeds a given threshold , @xmath8 , which is derived self - consistently within the multiphase ism model .",
    "the related parameters , such as the normalisation of gas consumption time and evaporation efficiency of cold gas , are set to satisfy the empirical kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite .",
    "the sn feedback returns some fraction of the cold gas to the hot phase , and increases the thermal energy of the hot gas .    as an extension to the multiphase ism model ,",
    "the simulation includes a phenomenological model for sn - driven galactic wind @xcite .",
    "the galactic wind is particularly important for distributing the metals produced by sne into the igm .",
    "we use the strong kinematic wind with a velocity of 484kms@xmath9 .",
    "it has been shown that this model produces favourable results for the luminosity function of lyman - break galaxies at the bright - end @xcite and the hi column density distribution function @xcite at @xmath1 , when compared to the runs without the wind .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out the problems of this galactic wind model by comparing with the observations of civ absorption lines in quasar spectra , and suggested that the momentum - driven wind model @xcite is a more viable model , which can carry more metals with lower wind velocities . in this paper",
    "we choose not to modify our galactic wind model in order to single out the effects of metal cooling , and to allow direct comparisons to the previous works @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the effects of metal cooling on galaxy growth , while @xcite focused on the civ statistics of the igm .",
    "the metallicity of gas particles are also tracked by the code , assuming a closed box model for each gas particle .",
    "the yield ( @xmath10 ) of 0.02 is assumed . in principle",
    ", there could be a time delay between sn explosions and chemical enrichment of the ambient gas .",
    "unfortunately , current cosmological simulations do not have sufficient resolution to track the detailed mixing process of metals .",
    "in our simulations , we ignore this time delay and assume an instantaneous mixing within each gas particle .",
    "this assumption is reasonable , because the overall time step of the simulations is longer than the mixing time - scale on small scales .",
    "ideally we would like to track individual metals and compute the cooling rate of each element at each time - step of the simulation .",
    "this approach has been used to study the evolution of individual galaxies @xcite . for cosmological simulations",
    ", it requires a large memory to track individual metals and the computation becomes exceedingly expensive ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for such an attempts ) .",
    "our simulations collectively track the total mass fraction of metals ( @xmath11 ) as the measure of metallicity .",
    "we obtain the chemical abundance and cooling rates for a given @xmath12 and temperature by interpolating the table given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sd93 ) for the standard collisional ionisation equilibrium model , and create a lookup table .",
    "metal cooling is implemented in the full range of metallicity in the table from sd93 , from [ fe / h]=-3 to [ fe / h]=1 .",
    "in addition , the metal cooling outside of this range is computed by extrapolating the table .",
    "we require that the extrapolation does not go lower than the primordial cooling rate .",
    "the primordial abundance pattern is used where [ fe / h ] @xmath13 @xcite , and the solar abundance pattern is used where [ fe / h ] @xmath14 @xcite . for @xmath15 [ fe / h ] @xmath16 ,",
    "the abundance pattern is computed by interpolating between the primordial and solar abundance patterns .",
    "note that , [ fe / h ] = @xmath17 - @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number density .",
    "figure [ fig : xyz_table ] shows the relationships between the metal parameters ( [ fe / h ] , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ) and the total metallicity @xmath12 . because the abundance pattern is fixed for a given @xmath12 , [ fe / h ] is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath12 .",
    "the main difference between the solar and the primordial abundance pattern is the oxygen or @xmath7-particle enhancement . in the early phase of metal enrichment ,",
    "type ii sne are the main source of metals and they tend to generate more @xmath7-particles than sn ia .",
    "therefore , it is expected that a low metallicity gas to have more @xmath7-particles than the high metallicity one .",
    "as mentioned above , we use two different chemical abundance pattern ( at low- and high - end of the @xmath12 values ) to model this evolution in chemical composition .",
    "we compute the oxygen abundance based on the table 4 of sd93 . in our code",
    ", we incorporate the metal cooling effect by adding the additional cooling contribution from metals on top of the primordial cooling rate , which is computed in a similar fashion as described in @xcite .",
    "metal enrichment changes the mean molecular weight @xmath23 , which is needed to compute the temperature and internal energy of gas . in order to compute @xmath23",
    ", we need to know the electron number density @xmath24 , which varies with metallicity .",
    "we obtain the values of @xmath24 from sd93 in the same way as we obtained the metal cooling rates .",
    "our electron number density estimate ignores the electrons from photoionised metals by the uv background radiation , but we expect that the number of electrons from ionised metals will be small .    varying the mean molecular weight @xmath23 also influences the sf threshold density @xmath8 in the multiphase ism model of @xcite , as well as the cold and hot gas fractions of multiphase gas particles . in this paper , we consider two different treatments of @xmath8 . in the ` constant @xmath8 ' model ,",
    "we take the value of @xmath8 as in the original formulation by @xcite and do not modulate @xmath8 by the varying @xmath23 . in the ` varying @xmath8 ' model , we take into account of the modulation of @xmath8 by the change in @xmath23 .",
    "we use three series of simulations with varying box size and resolution .",

    "the effects of galactic wind are also tested by turning on and off the wind .",

    "owing to the comparably small box size and missing long wavelength perturbations , we evolve the n144l10 and n216l10 series only down to @xmath26 . to evolve the simulation toward lower redshifts ,",
    "we need a simulation with a larger box size .",
    "therefore we implement the ` n288l34 ' series , which has a larger box size than other series , but a lower resolution .",
    "this series is evolved down to @xmath0 .",

    "the metallicity of diffuse igm is generally lower than @xmath34 at @xmath35 , and the metal cooling effect on igm is small .",
    "however the local sfr could be enhanced significantly even at high-@xmath31 when the ism is enriched to @xmath36 , which can be easily achieved after a few events of sn ii .",
    "our results suggest that star formation at high-@xmath31 can also be enhanced by metal cooling , and not just at low-@xmath31 .",
    "we also find that the peak of the cosmic sf history hardly shifts by the introduction of metal cooling , consistently with the estimate by @xcite .",
    "the n216l10mv run has a lower sfr at @xmath37 and a higher sfr at @xmath38 than the n216l10mc run .",
    "this is because at high-@xmath31 , the value of @xmath8 is higher in the ` mv ' run than in the ` mc ' run due to lower metallicity and mean molecular weight , leading to a larger fraction of gas not being able to satisfy the sf criteria in the n216l10mv run than in the n216l10mc .",
    "the opposite is true at @xmath39 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr_n216l10 ] also shows that the sfr in the n216l10nw run is higher than other runs by an order of magnitude .",
    "this is because the gas can cool very efficiently without being ejected by the galactic wind .",
    "although the current galactic wind models in cosmological simulations are not well established yet and need to be improved , both theoretical and observational studies evidently suggest the important role of galactic wind feedback @xcite .",
    "as expected , the n144l10mc run has lower sfr densities at @xmath40 compared to the n216l10 series .",
    "this is because a lower resolution run is unable to resolve low - mass halos that would otherwise forms stars in them .",
    "when the star formation at high-@xmath31 is underestimated , some of the gas remain unconverted into stars until lower redshift , resulting in a higher sfr at @xmath41 in the n144l10mc run than in the n216l10mc run .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr_n288l34 ] shows the cosmic sf history down to @xmath0 for the n288l34 series .",

    "by @xmath42 the igm metallicity becomes high enough to noticeably increase the cooling rate , and the accretion of igm onto galaxies becomes more efficient , which later fuels the star formation .",
    "our results suggest that the cosmic sfr density is enhanced by metal cooling at @xmath43 by both of the following two effects : 1 ) more efficient igm accretion onto galaxies due to higher metallicity of igm , and 2 ) increased sf efficiency due to higher cooling rate with the contribution from metal cooling .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr_n288l34 ] the analytic model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq.(2 ) , hereafter h&s model ) is also shown in the green dot - dashed line .",
    "this model is a result of many cosmological sph simulations with increasing resolution , and the authors gave a theoretical interpretation to the empirical fitting formula for the cosmic sfr density . since our runs adopt a lower value of @xmath44 than the original value used to derive the h&s model ( @xmath45 ) , we modify the h&s model by rescaling the @xmath46 parameter in their eq.(2 ) and eq.(47 ) .",
    "this reduces the sfr density at @xmath47 by @xmath48% , but not much at @xmath49 .",
    "the results of the n288l34 and n216l10mc runs agree well with the h&s model at @xmath41 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "this is expected , because the n288l34 run adopts the same physical models as in the original simulations that were used to derive the h&s model . at high-@xmath31",
    ", both runs fall short compared to the h&s model owing to insufficient resolution .",
    "the metal enrichment and metal cooling also change the phase space distribution ( @xmath51 diagram ) of cosmic gas .",
    "figure  [ fig : phase.n216l10 ] shows the state of cosmic gas at @xmath1 for the n216l10 series . as shown in panel ( @xmath52 ) , the baryons in the universe can be broadly categorised into four different phases according to their overdensity and temperature : ` hot ' , ` warm - hot ' , ` diffuse ' , and ` condensed ' @xcite .",

    "star formation and sn explosions occur in the multiphase star - forming gas , therefore the immediate effect of metal cooling appears in the condensed phase . the presence of gas at @xmath59k with metal cooling results from the effective temperature calculation for the multiphase medium , and not from the direct gas cooling down to @xmath59k . according to the multiphase scheme in @xcite , the star forming gas consists of two phases : hot gas ( @xmath60k @xmath61 @xmath62k ) and cold gas ( @xmath63k ) .",

    "the original gadget imposes the effective temperature of @xmath64k at the sf threshold density . in our metal cooling scheme ,",

    "the value of @xmath8 was kept fixed as the original value , which causes a sharp edge at @xmath65 for the multiphase gas . in the n216l10mv run , the value of @xmath8 was varied according to the change in mean molecular weight , therefore the condensed gas has a spread in both temperature and density near @xmath65 .",
    "galactic wind returns the metal - enriched , star - forming gas to the hot and low density igm , as evidenced in the @xmath66 diagrams .",
    "this metal - enriched , low - density ( @xmath67 ) gas is absent in the n216l10nw run , which clearly shows the necessity of galactic wind to explain the metallicity observed in ly@xmath7 forest .",
    "the phase distribution of igm in the n216l10 , n216l10mc , and n216l10mv runs are very similar .",

    "the connection between the four phases of cosmic gas is important in galaxy formation , and it is beneficial for us to study their evolution for a better understanding of metal cooling effects .",

    "a similar behaviour is seen for the condensed phase , and the n288l10mc continues to increase its condensed mass .",
    "this suggests that the metal cooling enhances the igm accretion onto galaxies mostly at @xmath39 , which supplies the fuel for star formation .",

    ". in the n216l10mc run , the peak of mass function is shifting more toward the massive side than in the n216l10 run at @xmath1 . from @xmath83 to @xmath1 , the low - mass galaxies merge to form more massive galaxies , increasing the number of galaxies with @xmath84 furthermore .",
    "it also seems that the formation of low - mass galaxies ( @xmath81 ) is enhanced by metal cooling at early times ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "however we find that the behaviour of mf at the low - mass end is somewhat dependent on the threshold density for the grouping . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : groups ] , our grouping code imposes a threshold gas density of @xmath29 for a gas particle to be part of a galaxy . when we lower this threshold density , we find that the two mfs for the n216l10 and n216l10mc converged , as more particles are incorporated into galaxies at the outskirts of galaxies .",
    "metal cooling increases the gas density in galaxies , enabling more low - mass galaxies to satisfy the gas density threshold and to be identified as simulated galaxies .",
    "therefore the behaviour of mf at @xmath86 is somewhat dependent on the choice of the outer threshold density of galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : mf_comp ] compares the gas and baryonic ( star + gas ) mfs for the n216l10 series at @xmath1 ( panels @xmath52 & @xmath72 ) , and the redshift evolution of the baryonic mf from @xmath87 to @xmath1 in the n216l10 ( panel @xmath74 ) and n216l10mc ( panel @xmath77 ) runs .",
    "here we show only the range of @xmath88 , which corresponds to the limiting mass of 32 gas particles .",
    "panel ( @xmath52 ) shows that more gas is converted into stars in the runs with metal cooling ( n216l10mc and n216l10mv ) compared to the n216l10 run , while panel ( @xmath72 ) shows that the baryonic mf is similar in all the runs . as we discussed in ",
    "[ sec : evolv4 ] , the igm accretion onto galaxies is not so much enhanced yet before @xmath89 due to relatively low igm metallicity , which explains the similarity in the total baryonic mf . in the runs with metal cooling ,",
    "the peak of gsmf is shifted toward higher mass , whereas the peak of gas mf is shifted toward lower mass .",
    "this suggests that the enhanced gsmf at @xmath1 is due to the increased sf efficiency by metal cooling within the galaxies .",
    "again , the apparent enhancement in the number of low - mass galaxies in the n216l10mc run compared to the n216l10 run is somewhat dependent on the threshold density of grouping , therefore it should be interpreted with caution .          as the accretion of igm onto galaxies",
    "become more efficient at @xmath2 due to the increased igm cooling by the metals , we expect that the total baryonic mass of galaxies would be more enhanced at @xmath0 than at @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mf_comp_n288l34 ] shows the mfs at @xmath1 and @xmath0 in the n288l34 series , and it clearly demonstrates that this expectation is true .",
    "here we show only the range of @xmath91 , which corresponds to the limiting mass of 32 gas particles .",
    "the general trend in the three ( star , gas , and total baryon ) mfs is similar to that we saw in figure  [ fig : mf_comp ] , although the difference at @xmath1 between the n288l34 and n288l34mc runs is slightly smaller than in the n216l10 series due to poorer resolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : mf_comp_n288l34]f shows most prominently the enhancement of the total baryonic mf at @xmath0 in the n288l34mc run owing to the metal cooling . in panels ( @xmath92 ) & ( @xmath93 ) , the n288l34 run actually has a longer tail at the most massive - end than the n288l34mc run .",
    "the reason for this feature is not fully clear , but it may be related to the balance between igm accretion and feedback . owing to metal cooling , igm accretion rate increases in the mc run , and",
    "the sfr is also enhanced , leading to a stronger feedback .",
    "the amount of mass loss is greater in low mass galaxies , but the net heating of igm is more significant for massive galaxies .",
    "the mc run has stronger feedback , therefore its feedback heating may become more significant than igm accretion for very massive galaxies .",
    "the significant igm heating suppresses the growth of massive - end of mass function from @xmath1 to @xmath0 and results in shorter tail for the mc run at @xmath0 as shown in figure  [ fig : mf_comp_n288l34]e , f .",
    "for a fixed galaxy baryonic mass , the enhancement of star formation by metal cooling would decrease the gas mass fraction , @xmath94 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gfrac_evol_n216l10 ] shows @xmath95 as a function of galaxy stellar mass for the n216l10 series .",
    "panel ( @xmath52 ) shows the data only from n216l10mc run at @xmath1 , and each data point corresponds to a simulated galaxy . to characterise the distribution ,",
    "we compute the following two quantities in each logarithmic stellar mass bin : ` average ' and ` median ' .",
    "the ` average ' is the ratio of total gas mass to total baryonic mass for all the galaxies in each mass bin , i.e. , @xmath96 .",
    "the ` median ' case is simply the median of @xmath95 values in each mass bin .",
    "both quantities show a similar trend , however , there is a sharper drop - off at @xmath97 for the ` median ' case in figure  [ fig : gfrac_evol_n216l10]a .",
    "this mass - scale corresponds to 32 star particles in the n216l10 series .",
    "we find that there are many galaxies with @xmath98 above this mass - scale , which causes the sharp drop - off in the ` median ' line . below this limiting mass ,",
    "galaxies are not resolved well , which results in an underestimate of star formation and an overestimate of @xmath95 .",
    "if we had a higher resolution simulation with finer particle masses , this limiting mass - scale would shift to a lower mass .",
    "therefore the location of this sharp drop - off is currently determined by the resolution of our simulation . however",
    ", dark matter halos would stop forming stars at some lower limiting halo mass , if we had an infinitely high - resolution simulation , this lower limit to the galaxy mass is presumably determined by the photoevaporation of gas by the uv background radiation @xcite .",
    "recent works suggest that star formation could be suppressed by the uv background in halos with @xmath99 at @xmath89 .",
    "galaxies with @xmath100 would reside in halos with @xmath101 .",
    "the n216l10 series would resolve such a halo with @xmath102 dark matter particles , and its mass resolution is actually close to the astrophysical limit for dwarf galaxy formation at @xmath89 .",
    "therefore the sharp drop - off in @xmath95 at @xmath100 may not be so far from the true answer .",
    "we find that @xmath103 increases with decreasing @xmath104 at all redshifts , regardless of metal cooling and wind effects .",
    "this trend is qualitatively consistent with current observations . @xcite estimate the gas fraction as a function of stellar mass using the rest - frame uv - selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath105 , and show that the gas fraction decreases with increasing stellar mass . and using the mean gas and stellar mass , they find the average @xmath106 , which agrees with the predicted gas fraction for massive galaxies in our simulation .",
    "in addition , @xcite reported that the average neutral gas fraction is @xmath107 for the local dwarf galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey . in our n216l10 series with metal cooling , the ` average ' @xmath95 reaches 0.6 for galaxies with @xmath108 at @xmath1 & 4 .",
    "figures[fig : gfrac_evol_n216l10]b , c , d show the redshift evolution of @xmath95 for the n216l10 series . in the runs with metal cooling ( n216l10mc and n216l10mv ) , @xmath95 is lower than in the n216l10 run by @xmath30% at all redshifts for galaxies with @xmath109 .",
    "this result suggests that the metal cooling reduces @xmath95 owing to more efficient star formation .",
    "the values of @xmath95 seem to be more convergent at the massive - end ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "in addition , we find that galaxies in the n216l10nw run are the most gas - rich , because almost no galactic gas is returned to the igm .    figures  [ fig : gfrac_evol_n216l10]b , c , d also show that @xmath95 is higher at higher redshifts .",
    "for example , the well - resolved galaxies with @xmath111 have @xmath112 at @xmath87 , but @xmath113 at @xmath1 .",
    "as we saw in figure  [ fig : mf_star]d , there is a considerable growth in gsmf from @xmath87 to @xmath1 .",
    "together with the decrease in the gas fraction , these results suggest that most of the gas accreted during @xmath114 has been converted into stars",
    ".    figure  [ fig : mgfrac_resolution]a highlights the redshift evolution of @xmath95 from @xmath87 to @xmath0 in the n288l34mc run .",
    "the gas mass fraction clearly decreases with decreasing redshift as the gas is converted into stars .",
    "the rate of decrease is greater at @xmath115 than at @xmath116 , with @xmath117 & 0.2 for @xmath118 , & 1 , respectively , for galaxies with @xmath119 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mgfrac_resolution]b shows the effect of resolution on @xmath95 .",
    "the location of the drop - off in @xmath95 shifts to lower masses as the resolution is increased from n144l10mc to n216l10mc run .",
    "the location of the drop - off is at around our resolution limit  the vertical lines in _ panel ( b)_. therefore the values of @xmath95 are overestimated in unresolved galaxies .",
    "using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with metal enrichment and metal cooling , we studied their effects on galaxy growth and cosmic sfr .",
    "owing to metal cooling , the sfr density increases about 20% at @xmath1 and about 50% at @xmath0 .",
    "our results suggest that metal cooling enhances the star formation through two different processes : 1 ) more efficient conversion of local ism into stars ( i.e. , increase of local sf efficiency ) , and 2 ) the increase of igm accretion onto galaxies .",
    "the former process is in effect essentially at all times at @xmath120 , because the local ism can be instantaneously enriched by sn explosions .",
    "this process enhances the sfr , but does not noticeably change the total baryonic mass of galaxies . the latter process ,",
    "on the other hand , can increase the total baryonic mass of galaxies , as well as enhancing the overall sfr density by supplying more gas for star formation .",
    "this process becomes effective only at lower redshifts ( @xmath39 ) , because it takes some time to enrich the igm up to @xmath121 .    in this paper",
    ", we used two different prescriptions for star formation in the runs with metal cooling : 1 ) the ` constant @xmath8 ' scheme and 2 ) the ` varying @xmath8 ' scheme .",
    "the value of @xmath8 was fixed in the former scheme , while it was modulated according to the metallicity in the latter scheme .",
    "both schemes show similar increase of cosmic sfr density ( see figure  [ fig : sfr_n216l10 ] ) , which implies that the overall sf enhancement by metal cooling is not so sensitive to the choice of @xmath8 ( but with some differences as we discussed in ",
    "[ sec : cos_sfr ] ) .",
    "the multiphase ism model for star formation by @xcite contains two free parameters : @xmath8 and the normalisation of gas consumption time - scale , @xmath122 .",
    "the values of these two parameters were originally chosen to match the empirical kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite using simulations of isolated disk galaxies . since we did not change the value of @xmath122 in the runs with metal cooling ( as well as @xmath8 in the ` mc ' runs ) ,",
    "it is possible that our simulations may now violate the kennicutt law .",
    "however , as we show in figure  [ fig : kenni ] , the plots of @xmath123 vs. @xmath124 for the n216l10 and n216l10mc runs are not so different from each other .",
    "this can be understood as follows . as figure  [ fig : evolv4]c showed",
    ", metal cooling increases the density and lowers the temperature of star - forming gas . the fundamental scaling relationship between sfr and cold gas density",
    "does not need to change when the metal cooling is introduced ; the star - forming gas particles would simply slide upward along the kennicutt law , @xmath125 .    in the case of n216l10mv run , we varied @xmath8 according to the gas metallicity , primarily scattering it to lower values because higher metallicity increases the cooling rate and lowers @xmath8",
    ". therefore more gas particles become eligible to form stars and @xmath124 is scattered upward above the kennicutt law for a given value of @xmath123 , resulting in a broader deviation from the power - law relationship of the kennicutt law near @xmath126 . at higher values of @xmath123 , @xmath124 is enhanced , but still within the range of the kennicutt law .",
    "this difference can be alleviated by adjusting the sf timescale ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , we try to emphasise the effect of metal cooing on sfr by keeping this parameter the same in all the runs .",
    "further investigations of the hi  aspect of our simulations is beyond the scope of the present paper , and we will present the results elsewhere .    upon evaluating the effect of metal cooling , @xcite considered two different gas phases where the cooling become important .",
    "one is the diffuse gas in galactic halos , which must radiate its thermal energy in order to collapse onto the high - density ism , and the other is the multiphase star - forming gas .",
    "they argued in their ",
    "5.2 that the cosmic sfr density at @xmath127 would not be affected by the metal cooling very much , because at high-@xmath31 cooling is so efficient that the gas in diffuse atmospheres of halos cools nearly instantly , even without any metal cooling .",
    "they expected their model results to be largely independent of metal enrichment , because in this regime the evolution of sfr density is driven by the fast gravitational growth of the halo mass function .",
    "for the star - forming multiphase ism , they argued that the parameters of their model ( e.g. cold gas evaporation efficiency and gas consumption time - scale ) can be adjusted such that the normalisation of the kennicutt law can be maintained , yielding to first order unaltered model predictions .",
    "however , our simulations , in particular the comparison between the n216l10 and n216l10mc run , suggest that the metal cooling can enhance the sfr density even at @xmath127 by @xmath128% .",
    "this is because the gas density becomes higher and temperature becomes lower ( see figure  [ fig : evolv4]c ) by responding to the enhanced cooling rate by metals .    in summary",
    ", we consider that our study serves to demonstrate the importance of metal enrichment and metal cooling in galaxy formation , beyond our original motivation to perform a simple numerical study .",
    "our study highlights the role of metals at low-@xmath31 and high-@xmath31 to enhance the star formation in the universe , and demonstrates that the metals increase the sf efficiency in the star - forming ism , as well as enabling more igm to accrete onto galaxies and fuel star formation .",
    "we expect that metal cooling would also alter some of the galaxy properties such as the mass - metallicity relationship ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and specific sfr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we plan to investigate these issues in the future , as well as alternative models for star formation and feedback .",
