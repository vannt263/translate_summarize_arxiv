    "supersymmetric grand unified theories ( sgut )  @xcite have achieved some degree of success : unification of gauge couplings , charge quantization , prediction of the weak mixing angle , the mass - scale of neutrinos .",
    "detection of weak scale superpartners or proton decay , as well as some patterns of fcnc / lfv and cp violation phenomena would indicate that some form of sgut lays beyond the sm  @xcite .",
    "although this degree of success is already present in the minimal models ( so(10 ) or some variant of su(5 ) )  @xcite , there are open problems that suggest the need to incorporate more elaborate constructions  @xcite , specifically the use of higher - dimensional representations in the higgs sector ( i.e. su(5 ) representations with dimension @xmath1 ) .",
    "for instance , a * 45 * representation is often included to obtain correct mass relations for the first and second families of d - type quarks and leptons  @xcite , while a * 75 * representation has been employed to address the doublet - triplet problem  @xcite .",
    "when one adds these higher - dimensional higgs representation within the context of @xmath2 susy guts , one must verify the cancellation of anomalies associated to their fermionic partners , i.e. the higgsinos .",
    "the most straightforward solution to anomaly - cancellation is obtained by including vector - like representations i.e. including both @xmath3 and @xmath4 chiral supermultiplets ; up to our knowledge this seems to be the option chosen by most models builders .",
    "it is one of the purposes of this paper to find alternatives to this option , namely to create an anomaly free higgs sector , including some representation @xmath3 and a set of other representations of lower - dimension @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that different anomaly - free combinations of representations are not equivalent in terms of their @xmath0  functions .",
    "it is also known that the unification condition imposes some restrictions on the gut - scale masses of the gauge bosons , gauginos , higgses , and higgsinos  @xcite .",
    "however the addition of complete gut multiplets does not change the unified gauge couplings , and neither modifies the unification scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution of the gauge couplings above the gut scale , up to the planck scale , depends on the matter and higgs content , thus the perturbative validity of the model is affected by the inclusion of additional multiplets .",
    "this is important in order to determine whether gravitational effects should be invoked for the viability of the model  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we also study the effect of the higher - dimensional higgs multiplets on the evolution of the gauge coupling up to the planck scale , focusing on models that invoke different sets of representations in order to satisfy the anomaly - free conditions .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the different mechanisms proposed in the literature to get anomaly free gauge theories for general gauge groups . focusing on su(n)-type models , we look for new alternatives to anomaly cancellation .",
    "the implications of our results for specific susy gut su(5 ) models are presented in section iii .",
    "the issue of gauge coupling unification , and the effect of higher - dimensional representations is discussed in section iv , where we include the 2-loop effect on the gauge unification that is brought by the yukawa couplings associated with those representations at the 1-loop level .",
    "finally our conclusions are presented in section v.",
    "whether a symmetry that holds at the classical level is respected or not at the quantum level is signaled by the presence of anomalies .",
    "the importance of anomalies was recognized almost immediately after the proof that yang - mills theories with ssb are renormalizable was presented in  @xcite .",
    "anomalies can be associated with both global or local symmetries , the latter being most dangerous for the consistency of the theory .",
    "the so - called perturbative anomalies arise in abelian gauge symmetries while non - abelian symmetries can have anomalies of a non - perturbative origin that turn out to be of topological nature  @xcite .",
    "the need to require anomaly cancellation in any gauge theory stems from the fact that their presence destroys the quantum consistency of the theory  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that all one needs in order to identify the anomaly is to calculate the triangle diagrams of the form avv , with a = axial , and v = vector currents .    for a given fermionic representation @xmath6 of a gauge group @xmath7 ,",
    "the anomaly can then be written as  @xcite : @xmath8 , \\ ] ] where @xmath9 denotes the generators of the gauge group @xmath7 in the representation @xmath10 , and @xmath11 denotes the anomaly associated with the fundamental representation .",
    "the anomaly coefficients @xmath12 for the most common representations are shown in table  [ table : sunreps1 ] for su(n ) groups ; a result that is known in the literature  @xcite . in order to obtain these results",
    "one makes use of the following relations :    1 .   for a representation @xmath13 that is a direct sum of two representations , @xmath14 ,",
    "the anomaly is given by @xmath15 2 .",
    "for a representation @xmath13 that is the tensor product of two representations , the anomaly is given by : + @xmath16 + with @xmath17 denoting the dimensions of representations @xmath18 .",
    "then , starting from the fundamental representations @xmath19 , we have taken the tensor products and evaluated the unknown coefficients that appear in the products in terms of @xmath20 .",
    "the dimension of the representations has been verified using the chain notation @xmath21 .",
    "results for some su(n ) representations can be read off from tables in  @xcite .",
    "we have extended these results to include additional higher - dimensional representations , with the corresponding expressions shown in table  [ table : sunreps2 ] .",

    "this will be illustrated with the su(5 ) case in the following section .",
    "let us consider an su(5 ) susy gut model .",
    "there are three copies of @xmath28 and @xmath29 representations to accommodate the three families of quarks and leptons .",

    "the * 24 * representation is itself anomaly free .",
    "the minimal higgs sector needed to break the sm gauge group can be formed with a pair of * 5 * and @xmath28 representations , which is indeed vectorial and therefore anomaly free ( this corresponds to case iii discussed above ) .",
    "now , within this minimal model with a higgs sector consisting of * * 5**+@xmath28 , one obtains the mass relations @xmath31 , which works well for the third family , but not for the second family , while it may or may not work for the first family , depending on whether or not one includes weak scale threshold effects@xcite .",
