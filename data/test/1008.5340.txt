    "a network formation game algorithm has been studied for multi - hop cdma networks in which wireless users attempt to connect to the base station via other users in the cellular network .",

    "<S> in this paper , we introduce a distributed dynamic routing algorithm for secondary users ( sus ) to minimize their interference with the primary users ( pus ) in multi - hop cognitive radio ( cr ) networks . </S>",
    "<S> we use the medial axis with a relaxation factor as a reference path which is contingent on the states of the pus . along the axis , we construct a hierarchical structure for multiple sources to reach cognitive pilot channel ( cpc ) base stations . we use a temporal and spatial dynamic non - cooperative game to model the interactions among sus as well as their influences from pus in the multi - hop structure of the network . </S>",
    "<S> a multi - stage fictitious play learning is used for distributed routing in multi - hop cr networks . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a set of mixed ( behavioral ) nash equilibrium strategies of the dynamic game in closed form by backward induction . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed algorithm minimizes the overall interference and the average packet delay along the routing path from su nodes to cpc base stations in an optimal and distributed manner . </S>"
