    "quantum turbulence ( qt ) is currently one of the most important topics in low temperature physics @xcite .",
    "qt has been long studied for superfluid helium , while the realization of bose ",
    "einstein condensation in trapped atomic gases has proposed another important stage of qt .",
    "after the realization in 1995 lots of experimental and theoretical works have been devoted to the issues of quantized vortices in this system @xcite .",
    "most works have addressed the system of a small number of vortices or a vortex array under rotation , but there are very few on qt .",
    "following a few theoretical proposals @xcite , henn _ et al .",
    "_ succeeded in creating and observing three - dimensional qt in trapped @xmath0rb becs @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of atomic gases is that multicomponent becs can be created experimentally .",
    "multicomponent becs allow the formation of various unconventional topological defects with complex properties that arise from the internal degrees of freedom and the interactions between different components @xcite , yielding a rich variety of superfluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "hence multicomponent becs can propose a more advanced system of qt . two - component qt has already been studied theoretically and numerically @xcite ; the most important interest would be how two kinds of qt interact .",
    "recently we have studied theoretically and numerically spin turbulence ( st ) in spinor becs @xcite .",
    "a spinor bec is a kind of multicomponent becs with spin degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the two - component becs , interatomic interactions allow for a coherent transfer of population between different hyperfine spin states ( spin - exchange collisions ) , which yields a fascinating physics different from two - component becs .",
    "spinor becs can be another important stage of turbulence in quantum fluids .",
    "when the system is highly excited from the ground state , it goes through hydrodynamic instability to st in which the spin density vector has various disordered direction .",
    "this st shows characteristic behaviors different from other kinds of qt .",
    "first , the spectrum of the spin - dependent interaction energy obeys a -7/3 power law @xcite , which is different from the traditional kolmogorov -5/3 power law in turbulence @xcite .",

    "the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the coefficients of the spin - independent and spin - dependent interactions .",
    "we focus on the spin - dependent interaction energy @xmath22 , whose coefficient @xmath21 determines whether the system is ferromagnetic ( @xmath23 ) or antiferromagnetic ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the gp equations ( [ 2dgp ] ) allows us to obtain the hydrodynamic equations of the spin density vector , which we need to understand the scaling power law in the energy spectrum .",
    "the full hydrodynamic equations are derived by yukawa and ueda @xcite , while its simper version is available for the ferromagnetic case @xcite .",
    "we will assume two things .",
    "first , the total density @xmath12 is time - independent because @xmath25 is usually much larger than @xmath26 .",
    "secondly , the spin density vector takes the largest value everywhere owing to the ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "the two assumptions are confirmed in our numerical simulation @xcite .",

    "@xmath12 keeps almost constant , thus vanishing @xmath31 . as a result , we obtain @xmath32 here space and time are respectively normalized by the coherence length @xmath33 and a characteristic time @xmath34 ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) , and @xmath37 is the sound velocity .",
    "another important characteristic length is the spin coherence length @xmath38 , which is relevant to spin structures such as domain walls and polar core vortex @xcite .",
    "we numerically created st by three different methods : ( 1 ) the instability of counterflow between the @xmath39 components in a uniform system @xcite , ( 2 ) the instability of the helical spin structure in a trapped system @xcite , ( 3 ) the instability by an oscillating magnetic field in a uniform system @xcite .",
    "all simulations are performed in a two - dimensional system . in every case",
    "we confirmed the -7/3 power law in the spectrum of the spin - dependent interaction energy and the spin - glass - like behavior @xcite , though only in the case ( 3 ) how to apply the oscillating magnetic field is different between @xcite and @xcite . in this section",
    "we describe the case of ( 1 ) as a typical one .",
    "the counterflow between the @xmath40 components with a relative velocity @xmath41 is represented by the initial wave functions @xmath42 ,   0 ,   { \\rm{exp } } \\bigl[-i\\bigl(\\frac{m}{2 \\hbar}\\mathbf{v}_{r}\\cdot \\mathbf{r } + \\frac{\\mu _ { -1}}{\\hbar}t\\bigr)\\bigr]\\bigr),\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is a unit vector along the @xmath44 direction and the chemical potentials @xmath45 and @xmath46 are equal to @xmath47 .",

    "[ ferro ] ( c ) , the energy spectrum takes a characteristic -7/3 power law ( fig . [ ferro ]",
    "( b ) ) .",
    "such a characteristic power law exhibits that this st is not just a random disordered state but an organized self - similar state .",
    "we can find easily the similar scenario in classical turbulence ( ct ) @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional fully developed turbulence has the inertial range , where the kinetic energy is transfered selfsimilarly from low to high wave numbers and its spectrum shows the kolmogorov -5/3 law .",
    "this kolmogorov law can be obtained by applying the scaling analysis due to the selfsimilarity to the hydrodynamic equations @xcite .",
    "the similar derivation is available to the hydrodynamic equation ( [ s ] ) .",
    "the present case allows us to neglect the second term in the left hand side , because @xmath64 is much smaller than @xmath65 .",
    "let us assume that eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) is invariant for the scale transformation @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "then it is easy to find that the spin density vector should be transformed as @xmath68 .",

    "the order parameter @xmath82 increases obviously as the exponent @xmath84 approaches @xmath85 , which means that the spin - glass - like order grows as the st with the @xmath85 power law develops .",
    "of course , our system of spinor becs differs from a magnetic system yielding spin glass .",
    "spin glass states do not show such a power law behavior in the energy spectrum , being much different from st .",
    "we do not know currently what causes the spin - glass - like behavior in st @xcite .",
    "when the amplitude of spin density vector is small , another -1 power law appears in the low wave number region in addition to the -7/3 power in the high wave number region of the energy spectrum in st @xcite .",
    "this kind of st is realized in two cases : ( i ) with antiferromagnetic interaction and ( ii ) with ferromagnetic interaction under a static magnetic field . in the first article",
    "@xcite we found that the antiferromagnetic interaction allowed the system to develop to st too but the power exponent of @xmath63 did not obey the simple scaling behavior discussed in the last section . investigating the behavior of the st led us to the consideration that the different behavior was attributable to the small spin magnitude .",
    "then we noticed that st with small spin amplitude is realized in the system with ferromagnetic interaction under a static magnetic field too , where the quadratic zeeman term reduces the spin amplitude .",

    "the order parameter @xmath10 does not grow , which means that spin density vectors are not frozen temporally but fluctuate .",
    "this behavior is much different from the ferromagnetic case .",
    "spinor bose - einstein condensates propose a novel system of turbulence in quantum fluids , namely spin turbulence ( st ) in which the spin density vectors are disordered .",
    "when the dynamics starts from an initial state with the energy much higher than the ground state or the system is excited from the ground state by an applied field , st appears after hydrodynamic instability .",
    "st exhibits some characteristic statistical laws , and the behavior depends on the spin - dependent interaction . when the spin - dependent interaction is ferromagnetic , the spectrum of the interaction energy shows the -7/3 power law ; this is understood through the scaling analysis for the hydrodynamic equations of spins and confirmed by the numerical simulation of the gp equations .",
    "furthermore , the spin density vectors are spatially random but temporally frozen , which reminds us of the analogy with spin glass ; the order parameter certainly grows in st .",
    "however , the story is just more complicated when the interaction is antiferromagnetic . then appears a boundary wave number @xmath102 , and the scaling analysis in st finds that the energy spectrum obeys the -1 power law for @xmath92 and the -7/3 law for @xmath94 ;",
    "the -7/3 power law was confirmed numerically .",
    "this energy spectrum actually comes from the small spin amplitude due to the antiferromagnetic interaction .",
    "the similar situation is expected to occur also for the ferromagnetic system under a static magnetic field that reduces the spin amplitude , in which both -1 and -7/3 power laws were confirmed clearly by the numerical simulation .",
    "the spin - glass - like behavior did not appear in the antiferromagnetic st .",
    "such a spin - disordered state was experimentally created in a trapped system through the instability of the initial helical structures of spin , and actually observed @xcite . creating st and observing the spin density vector @xmath103 would allow us to investigate the energy spectrum @xmath63 and the spin - glass - like behavior .",
    "it is very important to ask what causes the energy cascade in st . a mechanism causing the kolmogorov @xmath104 power law in classical turbulences is considered to be the richardson cascade of vortices @xcite .",
    "since there are very few topological defects in our simulation of st , however , the cascade due to them is not relevant . at present",
    "we guess the cascade of spin waves plays an important role for st .",
    "this will be worked in reference to the wave turbulence theory @xcite .",
    "usual selfsimilar power law in the inertial range of turbulence is caused by some dissipation at high wave numbers , which makes the energy flow towards high wave numbers .",
    "our system based on eq .",
    "( [ 2dgp ] ) conserves the total energy ; no dissipative mechanisms are included in our formulation .",
    "thus it is not so trivial to understand why and how the characteristic power laws are built and sustained in @xmath63 .",
    "here we should note that spinor becs have superfluid degrees of freedom ( mass current ) as well as spin degrees of freedom and they are coupled .",
    "hence the spin - dependent interaction energy @xmath105 is not conserved in the dynamics .",
    "while spin develops st , superfluid may create its own turbulence",
    ". it would be quite interesting to investigate how these degrees of freedom interact with each other and develop turbulence for the whole system .",
