    "v838 monocerotis is an eruptive variable star that underwent a nova - like event in early 2002 @xcite , with a peak intensity of @xmath3 .",
    "however , the eruption was unlike classical novae in that the effective temperature of the object dropped and the spectral type evolved into a very late m ",
    "l type @xcite .",
    "another unusual behavior was that the light - curve displayed multiple peaks in intensity , with the second peak being the brightest @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic studies indicated the presence of @xmath4-process elements , followed by the appearance of numerous oxygen - rich molecules @xcite .",
    "the eruption mechanism of v838 mon remains unclear , but appears to represent a new type of explosive variable .",
    "there have been two other variables that displayed similar late , cool spectral properties : m31-rv @xcite which achieved @xmath5 , and v4332 sgr ( @xcite;@xmath6 though the distance to v4332 sgr is uncertain ) .",
    "the discovery of a spectacular light - echo effect around v838 mon @xcite has allowed distance estimates to be made @xcite ; they indicate distances in the range 2.5  10 kpc , depending on the location of the reflecting material ( circumstellar vs. interstellar . )",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that the apparent center of the light echo appears to move on the sky ; this is inconsistent with a circumstellar dust model and would appear to favor the interstellar interpretation . assuming a distance of @xmath7 kpc @xcite , the peak luminosity was @xmath8 and the absolute visual magnitude was in the range @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "as of late 2004 the source had dimmed considerably in the visible from peak intensity ( @xmath11 ; kiss , personal communication to a.r . ) , but remained bright in the near - ir ( @xmath12 ; ashok & banerjee , 2004 ) .    the progenitor of v838 mon has been found @xcite in a variety of surveys , including 2mass @xcite , and appears consistent with a somewhat reddened early main sequence star ( b3v ) : @xmath13 ,  @xmath14 ,  @xmath15 ,  @xmath16 . during the 66 years preceding the 2002 outburst the progenitor was not significantly variable @xcite .",
    "@xcite point out that the progenitor was detected by iras ( iras 07015 - 0346 ) .",
    "post - outburst observations have found a faint , blue component in the spectrum @xcite and @xcite argued that the photometry is well - matched by a pair of early main sequence stars ( b3v + b1.5v or b4v + a0.5v ) .",
    "@xcite observed the ir behavior of v838 mon and fit their data to a model consisting of a cool ( @xmath17k , @xmath18au ) stellar photosphere surrounded by a large , absorbing molecular cloud ( @xmath19k , @xmath20au ) , deriving a total mass of the ejecta of 0.030.13@xmath21 .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the outburst of v838 mon .",
    "initial models included thermonuclear runaway on an old , cool white dwarf @xcite , though this may be hard to reconcile with the presence of a b3v companion .",
    "another possibility is the merger of a pair of main - sequence binary stars @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that v838 mon is a post - agb star and the event was due to he - flash @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite have suggested that the eruption was due to the accretion of several close - in giant planets by an expanding giant or agb star .",
    "this is consistent with the appearance of multiple peaks in the light curve , and with the spectroscopic detection of lithium @xcite .",
    "we have used the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) to resolve the @xmath22 m emission from v838 mon and measure its apparent angular diameter .",
    "the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) was built by nasa / jpl as a testbed for developing ground - based interferometry and is located on palomar mountain near san diego , ca @xcite .",
    "it combines starlight from two 40-cm apertures and measures the resulting interference fringes .",
    "the high angular resolution provided by this long - baseline ( 85 - 110 m ) , near infrared ( @xmath22 m ) interferometer is sufficient to resolve emission on the milli - arcsecond scale .",
    "the measured apparent angular diameter can be combined with distance estimates from the light - echo to determine the size of the emitting region and thus help constrain explosion models .",
    "we observed v838 mon on 6 nights between 5 november and 13 december 2004 ( mean modified julian date=53338.3 ) , using pti in the standard k - band mode , with the 85-meter north - west ( 4 nights ) and south - west ( 2 nights ) baselines . for detailed descriptions of the instrument",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite . each nightly observation consisted of one or more 130-second integrations during which the normalized fringe visibility ( or contrast ) of the science target was measured .",
    "the measured fringe visibilities of the science target were calibrated by dividing them by the instrument point - source response of the instrument ( typically @xmath23 ) , determined by interleaving observations of calibration sources ( table [ tab : calibs ] ) ; the calibration sources were chosen to be single stars with angular diameters smaller than 1 milli - arcsecond , determined by fitting a black - body to archival broadband photometry . while hd 49933 is listed as a double star in the simbad database , the companion is faint ( @xmath24 ) and distant ( @xmath25 arcseconds ) from hd 49933 , giving it a negligible impact on the measured fringe visibilities . for further details of the data - reduction process ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that in addition to the uncertainties derived from the internal scatter in the data , we add a 5% minimum systematic uncertainty to the visibility measurements , consistent with worst - case estimates for pti data based on comparisons with known sources .",
    "pti is equipped with a low - resolution spectrometer which provides fringe visibility measurements and photon count rates in five spectral channels across the k band .",
    "we compute a wide bandwidth average as the photon - weighted average of the five spectral channels .",
    "for the observations of v838 mon , the photon rates in the two edge channels ( 2.0 and 2.4 @xmath26 m ) were too low to provide useful data , and thus the fringe visibilities are effectively measured from 2.1 to 2.3 @xmath26 m .",
    "the faintness of the source in the edges of the k - band is consistent with the deep molecular absorbtion bands seen by @xcite using near - ir spectroscopy . using photon count rates from pti , and k - band magnitudes for the calibrator sources provided by 2mass @xcite",
    ", we derive a k - band apparent magnitude of @xmath27 for v838 mon , consistent with the measurement by @xcite of @xmath28 made on 4 october 2004 .",
    "we also note that within the limit of our statistical measurement noise ( @xmath29 mag ) the apparent magnitude did not vary during the period of observations .",
    "the theoretical relation between source brightness distribution and fringe visibility is given by the van cittert - zerneke theorem , with the two being a fourier - transform pair .",
    "for a uniform intensity disk model the normalized fringe visibility can be related to the apparent angular diameter using @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the first - order bessel function , @xmath32 is the projected aperture separation , @xmath33 is the apparent angular diameter of the star in the uniform - disk model , and @xmath34 is the wavelength of the observation .",
    "it is not necessarily true that the source is well - modeled by a uniform disk ; it may be better modeled by a limb - darkened disk or even a gaussian extended envelope @xcite .",
    "however , there is insufficient data at this point to make meaningful comparisons between gaussian and uniform disk models , and our uniform disk fits should be interpreted as measuring the angular extent of the source without providing detailed information on the radial intensity profile . on the other hand ,",
    "the availability of data taken with two different baselines ( and hence two different source position angles ) provides information about the angular intensity profile , and in particular we are able to distinguish between a circularly symmetric source and elliptical models ( see @xcite for a discussion of simple emission models ) .",
    "as indicated in figure [ fig : data ] the nw and sw data sets give differing apparent diameters , indicating that the source is not circularly symmetric .",
    "we fit the combined ( nw+sw ) data set using an elliptical model and solve for major and minor - axis diameters and position angle .",
    "another possible emission morphology is a pair of sources ; we model such a binary source using standard expressions @xcite and fit for the binary separation , position angle and intensity ratio .",
    "we performed least - squares fits of uniform disk , elliptical and binary models to the measured fringe visibilities .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab : fits ] and figure [ fig : data ] .",
    "we find that the circularly - symmetric uniform disk model does not match the data particuarly well ( @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the sum of the squares of the residuals , divided by the number of degrees of freedom ) . there is insufficient data to distinguish between an elliptical ( @xmath37 ) or a binary emission model ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "it is likely that an even more complicated morphology will ultimately be required to fully match the data .",
    "we examine the possibility of systematic errors mimicing the effect of non - symmetric emission using the following test : we use one of the calibrators ( hd 49434 ) as a `` check star '' , calibrating it using our second calibrator ( hd 49933 ) , and fitting a circularly - symmetric uniform disk model ( expected to be a good fit for a single main - sequence star ) to this data set .",
    "the fit has @xmath39 for 14 points ( including points measured on both available baselines ) , and produces an apparent angular diameter of @xmath40 milli - arcseconds ( data not shown ) , fully consistent with the expected diameter based on spectrophotometry .",
    "the large uncertainty in the final diameter is merely due to the fact that such a small source is very neary indistinguishable from a point source using the available baselines .",
    "we would not expect to see the putative b3v binary companion to v838 mon , as it would have a contrast ratio in the k band of @xmath41 magnitudes .",
    "such a large magnitude difference would modulate the apparent fringe visibility by at most @xmath42 , much smaller than our measurement precision .",
    "we have modeled the @xmath22 m emission from v838 mon using several simple emission morphologies , including uniform and elliptical disks and binary models .",
    "we find that the best fits to the data are provided by elliptical or binary models .",
    "however , the preference is not overwhelming .",
    "we also note that it is quite likely that the emission morphology is more complicated than these simple models indicate ; further observations are certainly required .",
    "we caution the reader that the stated parameter uncertainties are merely indications of the statistical uncertainties .",
    "there is a larger , and less well - quantified , uncertainty associated with the choice of emission model .",
    "if the emission is interpreted as coming from a circularly - symmetric uniform disk , the best - fit size is @xmath43 milli - arcseconds . for a distance of @xmath1 kpc , derived from the light - echo ,",
    "the implied linear radius is @xmath44 au ( @xmath45 . )",
    "such a large stellar radius is consistent with previous estimates made during the outburst based on fitting an emission model to spectro - photometry : @xcite derive a stellar photosphere radius of 5.6 au , assuming a distance of @xmath46 kpc .",
    "scaling that result to a distance of 8 kpc would imply an apparent radius of 7.5 au .",
    "however , @xcite derives an apparent radius at the time of our observations of @xmath47 , somewhat inconsistent with this result . in any case",
    ", such a large radius can not be the radius of the white dwarf . in a nova outburst",
    "the system returns to its normal dimension in a few weeks or months - much less than the 3 years elapsed before our observations @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare the measured apparent radius with what might be expected based on simple photometric models : if we fit a black - body model to the observed near - contemporaneous jhk magnitudes ( october 2004 ; ashok & banerjee 2004 ) we derive a temperature of @xmath48k , a bolometric luminosity of @xmath49 and an apparent angular diameter of @xmath50 milli - arcseconds , marginally consistent with our measured value .",
    "however , a black - body is not a particularly suitable model for a 2000k stellar atmosphere .",
    "a better approximation can be provided by empirical surface - brightness relations .",
    "using the same photometry , and assuming a reddening correction @xmath51 together with v- and k - band surface - brightness relations from @xcite the available photometry predicts apparent angular diameters in the range @xmath52 milli - arcseconds .",
    "however , it should be noted that the @xmath53 color ( @xmath54 ) is somewhat out of the range of colors used to derive the relation ( -0.21.3 ) .",
    "the best formal fit to the data is given by a binary source model .",
    "however , this result must be interpreted with caution .",
    "the intensity ratio between the components , though uncertain , is nearly equal ( @xmath55 ) in the k - band . given that the k - band emission is dominated by a single cool blackbody that appeared after the outburst , it is hard to imagine a scenario where the two sources are not ultimately the result of a single outburst mechanism .",
    "the best - fit separation of the binary components is @xmath56 milli - arcseconds ( @xmath57 au ) .",
    "another possibility indicated by the data is that the observed k - band emission is produced by a very elongated , elliptical structure .",
    "the projected linear dimensions of such a source are approximately @xmath58 milli - arcseconds ( @xmath59 au ) .",
    "we suggest that the observed k - band emission may be in part due to ejecta produced during the eruption .",
    "soon after the peak of the outburst , the expansion velocity of the ejecta was estimated as 50 - 350 km / s @xcite . for the time elapsed since outburst of @xmath60",
    "s , the distance between the ejecta and the star should be in the range 30220 au .",
    "this range is consistent with the projected separations we measure .",
    "it is also likely that the ejecta are not uniformly distributed , and hence the binary morphology preferred by the data may be `` clumpiness '' in the ejecta . in this context",
    "we note that polarimetric observations during the outburst @xcite indicate that the source became significantly polarized ( 0.7% at 5000 ) .",
    "this has been interpreted as being due to departures from spherical symmetry during the outburst .",
    "we have used the palomar testbed interferometer to observe the peculiar outbursting variable v838 mon .",
    "this is only the second published observation of a nova - like outburst using an optical / near - ir interferometer - the only previous result being the observations of nova cyg 1992 done using the mk iii interferometer @xcite .",
    "the high angular resolution provided by pti allows us to draw two preliminary conclusions .",
    "first , the source is resolved by our instrument and has a characteristic angular size of a few milli - arcseconds .",
    "second , the difference in measured fringe visibility between the two baselines is inconsistent with the source being a simple uniform disk .",
    "we have explored other possible source morphologies , including inclined disks and binary models and find that the data can be reasonably matched by such models , but clearly further data are needed to constrain them .",
    "we point out that any of the models proposed to explain the outburst of v838 mon need to account for the presence of very extended , cool , non - symmetric emission .",
    "we wish to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of k. rykoski , and to thank an anonymous referee for helpful comments .",
    "observations with pti are made possible through the efforts of the pti collaboration , which we acknowledge .",
    "this research has made use of the michelson science center at caltech ( http://msc.caltech.edu ) , jpl / nasa , the simbad database cds ( strasbourg , france ) , and of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the ipac / caltech , funded by nasa and nsf .",
