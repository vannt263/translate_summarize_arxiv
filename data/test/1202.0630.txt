    "this has been observed experimentally in many different types of materials , like doped semiconductors,@xcite granular metals @xcite or two - dimensional systems.@xcite    in recent years , there has been increasing interest in the non - equilibrium dynamics of hopping systems . in particular , the glass - like behavior at low temperatures has been studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically.@xcite in this work , we are interested in two features observed in the experiments .",
    "firstly , it was observed that the conductivity relaxes logarithmically as a function of time after an initial quench or perturbation.@xcite secondly , if the system initially in equilibrium is perturbed by some change in external conditions ( e.  g. , temperature or electric field ) for a time @xmath0 called the waiting time , the relaxation back towards equilibrium of some quantity like the conductance @xmath7 will depend both on @xmath0 and the time @xmath8 since the end of the perturbation .",
    "it is found in certain cases that the relaxation is in fact described by a function @xmath9 of the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "this behaviour is called _",
    "simple aging_.@xcite    while simple aging is observed in a range of different systems , we are here particularly concerned with experiments on disordered ino films.@xcite one question which has been raised is whether the observed glassy behavior is an intrinsic feature of the electron system , or a result of some extrinsic mechanism like ionic rearrangement.@xcite in this work , we address the _ intrinsic _ mechanism by performing dynamical monte carlo simulations of the standard lattice model of the electron glass .",
    "it is known @xcite that during a quench from an initial random state an effective electron temperature is quickly established , and that this temperature slowly relaxes to the bath temperature .",
    "we show that the electron temperature relaxes logarithmically over almost three decades in time and that the system demonstrates simple aging behavior in a stress aging protocol similar to what is seen in the experiments.@xcite while this does not constitute a proof of the intrinsic origin of the glassy behavior in the experiments on ino films , it shows that the model can display the observed behavior . to the best of our knowledge this was previously only demonstrated in a mean field approach,@xcite the accuracy of which is not well understood .",
    "we use the standard tight  binding coulomb glass hamiltonian,@xcite @xmath10 @xmath11 being the compensation ratio .",

    "@xmath14 are random site energies chosen uniformly in the interval @xmath15 $ ] . in the simulations presented here we used @xmath16 , which we know gives a well - developed coulomb gap and the es law for the conductance.@xcite",
    "the sites are arranged in two dimensions on a @xmath17 lattice where in all cases we used @xmath18 , which is sufficiently large to give a good estimate of the effective temperature in a single state without any averaging over a set of states .",
    "we implement cyclic boundary conditions in both directions .    to simulate the time evolution we used the dynamic monte carlo method introduced in ref .  .",
    "the basic idea of such simulations is to start the system in some particluar configuration .",
    "the configuration can change by one electron jumping from site @xmath19 to site @xmath20 ( in principle , we should also take into account transitions involving two or more electrons jumping at the same time , but at the temperatures we consider here this should be a minor effect , see ref .   and references therein for a discussion ) .",
    "the energy mismatch between the two states is supplied by the emission or absorption of a phonon , therefore the process is called phonon - assisted tunneling .",
    "the rate of a phonon - assisted transition from site @xmath19 to site @xmath20 is usually specified as ( see , e.g. , ref . )",
    ",    @xmath21    here @xmath22 is the phonon energy , @xmath23 is a coupling constant , which in general depends on the wave vector @xmath24 of the involved phonon . since @xmath25 the pre - factor @xmath26 leads to a power - law dependence of the transition rate on @xmath27 where the power is model dependent . since the power - law pre - exponential dependence does not change the results in a qualitative way we assume @xmath26 to be @xmath24-independent .",
    "@xmath28 is the equilibrium phonon density .",
    "we set @xmath29 so that temperatures and energies are measured in the same units .    in the given initial state ,",
    "one should , in principle , calculate all such rates , then select one at random weighted by the rates .",
    "the selected transition is then performed , all coulomb energies recalculated , and the process repeated from the new state .",
    "note that the rates depend on the states through the energy changes @xmath22 , which include the contributions from the coulomb energy .",
    "all the rates therefore have to be recalculated at each step . in practice ,",
    "one restricts the possible jumps by only considering those where the distance @xmath30 is less than some maximal length ( in our simulations we only considered jumps of less than 10 lattice units ) since longer jumps become so improbable that they are never selected anyway .",
    "the procedure of selecting the next jump is also optimized in other ways , see ref .   and , in particular , ref .",
    "for a description of how to calculate the proper elapsed time . the only difference from ref",
    "is that following ref .",
    ", we use for the transition rate @xmath31 instead of ( [ gamma ] ) the approximate formula @xmath32 where @xmath22 is the energy of the phonon and @xmath30 is the distance between the sites .",
    "@xmath33 contains material dependent factors and energy dependent factors , which we approximate by their average value ; we consider it as constant and its value , of the order of @xmath34 s , is chosen as our unit of time .",
    "( note that in ref .",
    "a different approximate formula was used , we do not believe that the difference is of great significance , although it may change numerical values ) .",
    "to get more detailed understanding of how the effective temperature is established , we can follow the effective temperature as a function of time after an initial quench or some external perturbation like a strong electric field is applied .",
    "let us first relax from an initial random state and measure @xmath35 . in all our simulations we used a phonon temperature @xmath36 , which we know is well into the es regime for vrh .",

    "the same is seen by the effective temperature , where @xmath38 in the final state .",
    "we see that the effective temperature , after some initial short time , logarithmically decreases in time for about two and a half orders of magnitude .",
    "the energy does not show this behavior ( as discussed in ref .",
    ", it is well fitted by a stretched exponential function ) .",
    "the relaxation of the effective temperature was studied previously@xcite using a similar numerical method , but having the sites at random instead of on a lattice .",
    "a lower temperature was also used , and together this slows down the simulations so that only much smaller samples , up to 2000 sites , could be studied . instead of out linear fit to effective temperature as a function of @xmath39 they obtain a linear fit to effective temperature as a function of @xmath40 .",

    "this behavior is also observed in the experiments,@xcite it is characteristic for stronger fields .",
    "overall , what we observe is qualitatively very close to what is seen in experiments , but it should be noted that in experiments it is always the conductance that is measured , whereas we have studied the effective temperature . if we believe that the nonlinearity of the conductance is mainly due to heating of the electrons , then the nonlinear conductance can be found as the linear conductance , @xmath56 , at the effective temperature .",
    "it is known that this is approximately true.@xcite based on this assumption and expecting that @xmath57 is an analytical function one would expect that @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "this would be sufficient to show that the behavior of the conductivity would be the same as what we see for the effective temperature .",
    "however , in our case @xmath48 is significantly greater than @xmath3 , and the above consideration seemingly does not work .",
    "therefore we made an attempt to study conductivity directly .",
    "instead of turning off the field after @xmath0 we switched to @xmath60 which should be more or less the highest field which is still in the ohmic range . the effective temperature shows behavior which is similar to the one seen at @xmath61 , which is what we expect since this field is so weak as to hardly affect the effective temperature .",
    "to simulate the relaxation of conductivity is not so easy .",
    "firstly , because to find the conductance , the system has to be followed over some time and transported charge measured .",
    "usually it is noisy and one needs to average over a considerable time . with a large system like the one we have used",
    ", it is better , but still difficult to follow changes in the current . secondly , and more importantly , when the strong , non - ohmic field is applied , the system is polarized by charges shifting locally .",
    "these are charges which are not on the conducting path , and therefore they do not contribute to the dc current .",
    "but when the field is switched to a small , non - ohmic value , these charges will flow backwards .",
    "since we find the current by counting transferred charge in the direction of the field for each jump this will lead to a negative current for some time until this polarization has relaxed .",
    "one can ask whether this would also be seen in real experiments which only measures current in an external circuit .",
    "it seems that even if the localized charges are not on the conducting path , they would be capacitively coupled to the external circuit , and thereby detectable in real experiments .",
    "no such effect has been reported .    to see the relaxation of the conductivity",
    ", we took the accumulated transferred charge and subtracted the same in the absence of measuring field , which should contain only the relaxation of the polarization .",
    "the result was smoothed and the derivative calculated to find the current .",
    "the resulting curve showed some relaxation of the current , but the noise was too large and further work is needed in order to draw any clear conclusions .",
    "the phenomenology observed in our simulations agrees with what is seen in the experiments @xcite in virtually all essential aspects : we observe logarithmic relaxation of the effective temperature after a quench from a random initial state .",
    "we also observe logarithmic relaxation after driving the system for some time @xmath0 with a strong electric field .",
    "when the driving field is not too strong and @xmath0 not too long we observe simple aging in the sense that the curves for different waiting times collapse on a common curve when plotted as functions of @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath0 exceeds some critical value , @xmath53 , the scaled curves do not follow the common curve .",
    "when the driving field is large the curves do not collapse even for short times .",
    "the only difference is that while in the experiments conductance was measured , we have studied the effective temperature .",
    "we have to rely on the assumption that the conductance is given by the linear conductance at the effective temperature to relate our results to the experiments .",
    "the aging protocol discussed here is the subject of a recent mean field analysis.@xcite it predicts the relaxation of the average occupation number after the field is turned off .",

    "the idea is that the failure to collapse the curves for long @xmath0 is because @xmath73 and we have to use the full exponential integral instead of only the leading logarithmic term . assuming the excess effective temperature follows the same law as the conductance we should plot @xmath74 as function of @xmath75 $ ] and obtain a collapse of the curves to a straight line ( fig .",
