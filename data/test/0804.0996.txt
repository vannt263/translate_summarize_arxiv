    "woven graph codes can be considered as a generalization of low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) block codes @xcite .",
    "their structure as graph codes makes them suitable for iterative decoding .",
    "moreover , the ldpc block codes are known as codes with low - complexity decoding and they can be considered as competitors to the turbo codes @xcite which are sometimes called parallel concatenated codes . as mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "the underlying graph defines a permutation of the information symbols which resembles the interleaving in turbo coding schemes .    on the other hand , similarly to the ldpc codes , graph codes usually have minimum distances essentially smaller than those of the best known linear codes of the same parameters . at a first glance , the minimum distance of a graph code does not play an important role in iterative decoding since the error - correcting capability of this suboptimal procedure is often less than that guaranteed by the minimum distance .",
    "however , in general , the belief - propagation decoding algorithms work better if the _ girth _ of the underlying graph is large , that is , if the minimum distance of the graph code is large @xcite .    in the sequel we distinguish between graph , graph - based , and woven graph codes .",
    "we say that a _ graph code _ is a block code whose parity - check matrix coincides with the incidence matrix of the corresponding graph . _ graph - based codes",

    "each vertex in the underlying graph corresponds to a constituent block code .",
    "the main feature of these codes is that the block length of their constituent block codes coincides with the degree of the underlying graph .",
    "we introduce _ woven graph codes _ which are , in fact , graph - based codes with constituent block codes whose block length is a multiple of the graph degree @xmath7 , that is , their block length is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is an integer .",
    "in particular , when @xmath9 tends to infinity we obtain convolutional constituent codes .",
    "distance properties of bipartite graph - based codes with constituent block codes were studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that if the minimum distance of the constituent block codes is larger than or equal to @xmath10 , then there exist asymptotically good codes with fixed constituent codes among these graph - based codes .",
    "also it was shown in @xcite that for some range of rates , random graph - based codes with block constituent codes satisfy the vg bound when the block length of the constituent codes tends to infinity .",
    "one disadvantage of graph - based codes that becomes apparent in the asymptotic analysis is that good performances can only be achieved when the block length of the constituent block codes ( which in this case coincides with the graph degree @xmath7 ) tends to infinity . in practice",
    "this leads to rather long graph - based codes with not only rather high decoding complexity of the iterative decoding procedures but also high encoding complexity .    in this paper",

    "it is shown that when the overall constraint length of the woven graph code tends to infinity in the random ensemble of such convolutional codes we can find @xmath13 such that there exist codes satisfying the costello lower bound on the free distance for any rate .",
    "we also describe the constituent convolutional codes as block codes over the field of binary laurent series @xcite .",
    "this description as well as the notion of _ block _ hamming distance @xcite of convolutional codes is used to derive a product - type lower bound on the free distance of woven graph codes with constituent convolutional codes and to construct examples of such woven codes with rate @xmath1 . for a given hypergraph the free distance of the woven graph code depends on the numbering of code symbols associating to the hypergraph vertices . by a search over all possible permutations of the constituent code we found an example of a rate @xmath1 woven graph code with overall constraint length @xmath14 and free distance @xmath2 .",

    "for simplicity we consider the rate @xmath277 code that is obtained by ignoring the eighth information symbol which yields a @xmath278 subcode of this code .",
    "it is easy to see that renumbering the graph vertices by adding to each vertex number some fixed number modulo the total number of vertices preserves both the incidence and adjacency matrices of the graph .",

    "notice that many regular bipartite graphs look very similar to the heawood graph in the sense that by manipulating the incidence ( parity - check ) matrices and truncating lengths we can obtain infinite families of graphs .",
    "some properties of these graphs can be easily predicted from the properties of the corresponding parent convolutional codes .",

    "we obtain @xmath290 on the other hand , it was verified by computer search that any codeword of the woven graph code determined by ( [ woven ] ) consists of at least three nonzero codewords of the component code @xmath126 described by ( [ 90 ] ) .",
    "moreover , it was found by computer search that each of these nonzero codewords of @xmath126 has the minimum block weight @xmath291 .",
    "note that the codewords of the block code over @xmath287 with block weight @xmath291 corresponds to the codewords of the convolutional code belonging to its subcodes of rate @xmath292 .",

    "taking into account that all other codewords of the woven graph code contain at least four nonzero codewords of @xmath299 of block weight @xmath300 we obtain an improved lower bound on the free distance of the woven graph code as @xmath301 .    in order to obtain an upper bound on the free distance of the woven graph code we consider the parity - check matrix ( [ woven ] ) in more detail .",
    "it also describes a quasi - cyclic code and can by row permutations be reduced to a parity - check matrix of a two - dimensional code , a tb ( block ) code in one dimension and a convolutional code in the other , @xmath302 a parity - check matrix of the parent convolutional code for the tb code ( [ modwoven ] ) given in symbolic form is @xmath303 where @xmath304 and @xmath305 are formal variables .",

    "the permutation @xmath318 , @xmath319 , and @xmath320 describes the woven graph code with the largest free distance .",
    "the overall constraint length of this generator matrix is equal to 70 but the matrix is not in minimal form .",
    "a minimal - basic generator matrix @xcite has the overall constraint length equal to 64 and differs from ( [ tb13 ] ) by one row which can replace any of the rows of @xmath313 and has the form @xmath321 where @xmath322 where @xmath323 and @xmath324 .",
    "the matrix ( [ tb13 ] ) is a generator matrix of a convolutional code of rate @xmath325 . by applying the beast algorithm @xcite to the minimal - basic generator matrices corresponding to the different permutations of the columns @xmath139 , @xmath317 we obtained the free distance and a few spectrum coefficients of the corresponding woven graph codes .",
    "the parameters of the best obtained woven graph codes are presented in table 1 .",
    "generally speaking , encoding of graph - based block codes has complexity @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the blocklength .",
    "this technique implies that we find a generator matrix corresponding to the given parity - check matrix and then multiply the information sequence by the obtained generator matrix .",
    "however , we showed by examples that some regular graph codes as well as woven graph codes are quasi - cyclic codes and thereby they can be interpreted as tb codes . for this class of codes",
    "the complexity of the encoding is proportional to the constraint length of the parent convolutional code .    in this section",
    "we are going to illustrate by an example an encoder of a woven graph code with constituent convolutional codes having encoding complexity proportional to the overall constraint length of the corresponding woven graph code @xmath326 .",
    "consider again the woven graph code in our example .",
    "it is based on the heawood graph and uses constituent convolutional codes of rate @xmath4 and overall constraint length @xmath5 . taking into account the representation ( [ tb13 ] ) of the woven graph code as a rate @xmath325 two - dimensional code , a tb ( block ) code in one dimension and a convolutional code in the other , we can draw its encoder as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : encoder ] .    the input symbols @xmath327 enter the encoder once per each cycle of duration seven time instants . at each time moment",
    "the contents of each register is rewritten into the next ( modulo seven ) register and the three output symbols @xmath328 are generated . in other words , each of the registers corresponding to the constituent code can be considered as an enlarged delay element of the encoder of the `` tb - dimension '' code determined by the graph .",
    "the sequence @xmath327 determines a transition between the states of this encoder . after a cycle of seven time instants we return to the starting state of the enlarged encoder and a tb - codeword ( or a word from one of its cosets ) of length 21 has been generated .",
    "then the following seven input symbols @xmath329 enter and after seven time instants another word of length 21 has been generated , etc .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the woven graph codes with block as well as with convolutional constituent codes has been studied .",
    "it was shown that in the random ensemble of such codes based on @xmath0-partite , @xmath0-uniform , @xmath7-regular hypergraphs we can find a value @xmath13 such that for any code rate there exist codes meeting the vg and the costello lower bound on the minimum distance and free distance , respectively .",
