    "the study of open heavy flavor production in relativistic @xmath18 collisions is sensitive to different kinds of strong interaction physics . because the leading order ( lo ) production mechanism is gluon fusion  @xcite , open heavy flavor production rates are directly related to modification of the gluon parton distribution function ( pdf ) , i.e.  shadowing or saturation  @xcite .",
    "also , the initial and/or final state partons can scatter and lose energy in the cold nuclear medium  @xcite , thereby modifying and producing a nuclear modification of open heavy flavor production . recently",
    ", the possibility of flow even in small collision systems such as @xmath18 has raised the question of modified charm momentum distributions @xcite .",
    "modification to heavy quark production rates and kinematics in  collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is well established .",
    "electron production from open heavy flavor decay is enhanced  @xcite , while @xmath19 production is suppressed  @xcite at midrapidity . at positive rapidity , defined with the positive @xmath20 axis as the direction of the deuteron",
    ", there is a suppression of heavy - flavor decay muons  @xcite and a larger suppression of @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "while @xmath21@xmath13 correlations from open heavy flavor decays have not been published at rhic to date , correlations involving light flavor hadrons have shown modification in collisions at rhic .",
    "a suppression has been observed of positive rapidity @xmath22 mesons associated with midrapidity trigger hadrons , especially in the back - to - back peak at @xmath23 , indicating @xmath24 scatterings  @xcite .",
    "this suppression increases as @xmath25 , the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the gluon , decreases .",
    "these results are in quantitative agreement with energy loss models  @xcite and saturation models  @xcite .",
    "this paper presents measurements of azimuthal correlations of electron - muon pairs produced from heavy flavor decays , primarily @xmath17 , in and collisions using the phenix detector at rhic .",
    "the heavy - flavor @xmath21@xmath13 correlations are free of backgrounds from other sources that contribute to other dilepton analyses ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) , such as resonance decay and drell - yan . while analysis of dilepton mass and @xmath28 provides a way to separate charm and bottom contributions , the azimuthal correlations have an important advantage for studying the charm production process .",
    "the leading order production , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , will produce back - to - back open heavy flavor pairs that can semileptonically decay and produce azimuthally correlated @xmath21@xmath13 pairs .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) processes like flavor excitation and gluon splitting produce much less correlated @xmath31 and thus much less correlated @xmath21@xmath13 pairs .",
    "therefore , modification to different portions of the azimuthal correlations can be attributed to modifications of @xmath17 pairs from different production mechanisms . in energy loss models such as ref .",
    "@xcite , a broadening of the back - to - back azimuthal correlation should accompany a suppression of the peak due to the multiple scattering that the incoming gluons and/or the outgoing @xmath17 undergo in the cold nuclear medium .",

    "pythia@xcite indicates that the average @xmath25 of a parton producing a heavy flavor muon from 1@xmath32  gev/@xmath3 in the forward muon spectrometer is about @xmath33 .",
    "this analysis focuses only on the muons measured in the north arm utilizing the deuteron beam as a probe of low-@xmath25 partons in the gold nucleus .",
    "the central spectrometer comprises two arms subtending @xmath34 in azimuth and covering @xmath1 .",
    "charged tracks are measured using a drift chamber ( dc ) and a set of multi - wire proportional chambers with pad readout ( pc1 and pc3 ) .",

    "prior to entering the muon arm , particles pass through approximately 20  cm of copper and 60  cm of iron",
    ". particles that are not absorbed pass through the mutr , which comprise three stations of cathode strip chambers with multiple ionization regions and located inside a radial magnetic field . after the mutr , particles pass through the muid , which comprises five alternating steel absorbers and muid detector planes , called gaps , with iarocci tubes .",
    "muid roads reconstructed from muid hits are projected back to mutr tracks and to the measured vertex to provide the complete information for a track through the spectrometer .",

    "the bbc is a set of 64 hexagonal erenkov counters located from @xmath43 and covering full azimuth .",
    "the vertex of the collision along the beam line ( @xmath44 ) is determined by the time difference between the bbcs on either side of the collision region .",
    "the minimum bias ( mb ) trigger requires that there is at least one hit in each of the bbcs . from vernier scans and verified by monte carlo studies , the bbc mb trigger is sensitive to 55@xmath125% of the inelastic cross section and 88@xmath124% of the inelastic cross section@xcite .",
    "the trigger used for this analysis is a combination of the bbc trigger and a deep muon trigger .",
    "the deep muon trigger requires three or more muid gaps with a signal in both the @xmath25 and @xmath45 direction tubes and that the last pair of hits be in the last ( 5th gap ) or next to last gap ( 4th gap ) .",
    "after quality cuts and requiring a vertex within 25  cm of the @xmath20=0 vertex , an integrated luminosity of 2.1 pb@xmath46 in and a -equivalent of 7.7 pb@xmath46 in was sampled .",

    "at least three of five gaps with @xmath49 hit information are required , including a pair of hits in the 5th gap .",
    "these muid roads must project back near the nominal vertex position .",

    "are detailed in ref .",
    "the muid roads are then projected and matched to mutr tracks at the 1st muid gap .",
    "an identified muon candidate is the closest mutr track that matches a muid road within at least 10@xmath50 in slope and 10  cm in distance .",
    "muon candidates are further restricted to @xmath4 . during both the and data taking periods",
    ", there were backgrounds primarily from beam - related particles interacting with material in the accelerator upstream of phenix .",
    "collimators were used in the accelerator to reduce this background but it was not totally eliminated . restricting the @xmath51 range of the muon candidates helped minimize this background .",

    "@xcite . for this analysis ,",
    "the projected track must match within 3@xmath52 in position to a cluster in the emcal .",
    "clusters are also required to have a matching profile , when compared to an electromagnetic shower shape profile at the measured energy .",
    "once a track matches both the rich and the emcal , an @xmath53 cut is applied , where it is required that the energy measured in the the emcal @xmath54 be approximately equal to the reconstructed track momentum @xmath7 .",
    "this is sufficient to remove most combinatorial matches and background from real electrons resulting from long - lived particle decays occurring near the dc , which have mismeasured momentum .",
    "a cut of -2@xmath52 to + 3@xmath52 from the mean @xmath53 in the data and -1.5@xmath52 to + 3@xmath52 from the mean in the data is applied .",
    "the asymmetry of the cuts is due to the dominance of backgrounds below 2 or 1.5@xmath52 of the mean .",
    "the tighter cut in the data was necessary because of the increased background from the hadron blind detector ( hbd ) support material not present during 2006 data taking .",
    "after particle identification cuts have been applied to an event , all pairs of identified electrons and muons are formed in each of the four charge - sign combinations .",
