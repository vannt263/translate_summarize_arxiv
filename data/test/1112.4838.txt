    "many alternatives to the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics have been proposed over the last thirty years . among these , supersymmetry ( susy ) , and particularly its minimal version dubbed the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , is one of the most popular sm extensions .",
    "it consists in a symmetry linking fields with opposite statistics , matching thus a bosonic ( fermionic ) superpartner with each fermionic ( bosonic ) sm degree of freedom . as a consequence ,",
    "it predicts the stabilization of the gap between the electroweak and the planck scale , gauge coupling unification at high energies , and a lightest supersymmetric particle , which is weakly interacting and stable and thus a good dark matter candidate .",
    "since the superpartners of the sm particles have not yet been observed and in order to remain a viable solution to the hierarchy problem , susy must be softly broken at low energy , which makes the susy particles massive , with a mass lying in the tev range",
    ". therefore , susy searches at present hadron colliders , such as the tevatron at fermilab or the lhc at cern , are important topics of the current experimental high - energy physics program .    within the standard model ,",
    "flavour violation in the quark sector arises only through the rotation of the up- and down - type quark interaction eigenstates into the basis of physical mass eigenstates .",
    "four bi - unitary matrices are required to diagonalize the quark yukawa matrices , which renders the charged - current interactions proportional to the unitary ckm matrix @xmath0 . in the super - ckm basis @xcite",
    ", the squark interaction eigenstates undergo the same rotations as their quark counterparts , so that their charged - current interactions are also proportional to the ckm matrix .",
    "however , in non - minimal flavour - violating supersymmetric theories , the quark and squark fields can be misaligned due to additional sources of flavour violation which are related to the breaking of supersymmetry . as a consequence ,",
    "this leads to flavour - violating ( non - diagonal ) entries in the squark mass matrices .    in recent works",
    ", we have analysed the cases where such soft terms appear in ( non - minimal ) supergravity and gauge - mediated susy breaking scenarios @xcite . in the first case",
    ", supersymmetry is broken in a hidden sector and transmitted to the visible sector of squarks , sleptons , gauginos and gluinos through gravitational interactions .",
    "soft masses for sfermions are induced by direct khler interactions , which can in general be flavour non - diagonal @xcite . in the second case ,",
    "the breaking of supersymmetry is mediated to the visible sector via gauge interactions with messenger fields in a flavour - conserving fashion @xcite .",
    "however , it has recently been shown that non - minimal versions of the gauge - mediated susy - breaking mechanism can yield important flavour - violation in the squark and slepton sectors @xcite .    when susy is broken in a hidden sector",
    ", the soft masses also receive contributions from quantum effects due to the superconformal anomaly @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we therefore consider this so - called anomaly - mediated susy - breaking ( amsb ) scenario , where those anomaly - mediated effects are large compared to all other sources of susy - breaking , which are subdominant .",
    "we extend our previous work on flavour violation @xcite by investigating possible non - minimal flavour violation within the amsb context .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we define anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios and show how non - minimal flavour violation can appear . in sec .",
    "[ sec : scan ] we impose current experimental constraints on the flavour - violating amsb scenario and perform scans of the parameter space .",
    "in addition , experimentally allowed benchmark points are defined .",

    "[ sec : cosmo ] to an analysis of the possible cosmological constraints related to the presence of cold dark matter in our universe .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec.[sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in amsb scenarios , the soft terms are related to the anomalous dimensions of the different fields and have the feature to be renormalization - group invariant @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "they are fully determined by the known low - energy gauge and yukawa couplings and an overall mass scale @xmath1 , the vacuum expectation value of the scalar auxiliary field of the gravitation supermultiplet .",
    "this scale is expected to be of the order of the gravitino mass @xmath2 , and we assume in the following , to simplify , @xmath3 . consequently , the model is highly predictive , with fixed mass ratios and distinctive signatures @xcite . among all the predictions ,",
    "one finds , however , tachyonic sleptons .",

    "several solutions have been proposed @xcite , and we adopt here the phenomenological approach of assuming non - negligible contributions to the scalar soft masses , induced , _",
