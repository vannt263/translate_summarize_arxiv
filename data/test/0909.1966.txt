    "in particular , we give upper and lower bounds on the minimum numbers of curves in such a collection .    the original motivation for this work arose when considering fillings sets of _ systoles _ on closed hyperbolic surfaces ( definitions are given in section [ sec : def&note ] ) .",
    "thurston @xcite suggested that the subspace @xmath8 of teichmller space consisting of those surfaces that admit a filling set of systoles might form a mapping class group invariant spine .",
    "however still very little is known about this set of surfaces , and whether @xmath8 is indeed contractible remains to be shown .",
    "another natural but difficult problem is to determine the smallest size of a filling set of systoles .",
    "a first approach is to consider the topological constraints on such a set , for it is straightfoward to observe that the curves in a filling set of systoles are nonseparating and can only pairwise intersect at most once .    in our main result",

    "note that theorem [ smallsets ] is only really interesting where @xmath0 is much larger than @xmath6 .",

    "the number @xmath10 of curves in a smallest filling set of simple closed curves which pairwise intersect at most @xmath1 times satisfies @xmath14 ; in other words , @xmath15    the topological approximation given by theorem [ smallsets ] for the smallest number in a filling set of systoles turns out to be very crude .",

    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with definitions and notation in section [ sec : def&note ] . for the proof in section [ sec : thm1 ] of theorem [ smallsets ] , we use an euler characteristic argument to obtain a lower bound on the number in a filling set of curves which pairwise intersect at most @xmath6 times . to find an upper bound , we give a construction of such a set of curves whose",
    "cardinality is at most one larger than the lower bound .",
    "as it must work for all @xmath0 and satisfy this small cardinality condition , this construction is rather cumbersome to describe .",
    "thus in section [ hairy ] we produce for @xmath20 easier examples of such small sets of curves whose growth rate , though larger , still has order @xmath16 .",

    "the authors are thankful to greg mcshane for several helpful discussions which led to the use of the hairy torus example in section 3 .",

    "the third author is thankful to stanford university and the school of mathematics at the university of southampton for their hospitality during the conception of this paper .",
    "the results in this paper are stated only for closed , orientable surfaces , although it is possible to extend them to include punctured surfaces . on the other hand , our proofs work explicitly and extensively with compact surfaces with nonempty boundary , and",
    "so we begin with some conventions for this purpose .",
    "let @xmath21 be a compact , orientable surface with nonempty boundary .",
    "an @xmath22 on @xmath21 is a simple arc whose endpoints lie on the boundary of @xmath21 and whose interior lies in the interior of @xmath21 ( that is , we assume that all arcs are properly embedded ) .",
    "we usually confuse an arc with its homotopy class , relative to its basepoints .",
    "let @xmath23 be an arc on the surface @xmath21 .",
    "we record the three possibilities for the closure @xmath24 of the complement of @xmath23 in @xmath21 :    1 .",
    "the endpoints of @xmath23 lie in distinct boundary components of @xmath21 . in this case , @xmath23 is said to be _ boundary cutting : _ the connected surface @xmath24 has the same genus as @xmath21 , but one fewer boundary components . 2 .",
    "the endpoints of @xmath23 lie in the same boundary component of @xmath21 , and @xmath24 is connected . in this case , @xmath23 is said to be _ genus cutting : _ the surface @xmath24 has genus one less than the genus of @xmath21 and one more boundary component .",
    "the endpoints of @xmath23 lie in the same boundary component of @xmath21 , and @xmath24 is disconnected . in this case , @xmath23 is _ separating ; _ the surface @xmath24 has genus equal to the genus of @xmath21 and one more boundary component .",
    "these three possibilities will be revisited in the proof of theorem [ smallsets ] .",
    "note that the removal of an arc of type ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) does not disconnect the surface ; in these two cases , if @xmath21 is connected , then @xmath24 is also connected .",
    "the arcs of type ( 3 ) occur only towards the end of the proof of theorem [ smallsets ] , when describing the `` last curves '' in a filling set .",
    "note that parts of the boundary of @xmath24 come equipped with identifications corresponding to @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a closed , orientable surface of genus @xmath25 .",
    "a _ curve _ on @xmath9 is a simple , closed , essential ( homotopically nontrivial ) curve .",
    "we often confuse a curve with its homotopy class ; when considering curves which intersect , we generally aim to choose representatives for their homotopy classes with minimal intersection number .",
    "recall that a set of curves on @xmath9 _ fills _ if the complement of the union of its curves consists of simply connected components . given @xmath7 ,",
    "a set of curves forms a _ @xmath6-filling set _ if it fills the surface , and if any two curves in the set intersect at most @xmath6 times .    by a _",
    "hyperbolic surface _",
    ", we mean a surface equipped with a hyperbolic metric .",
    "every homotopy class of curves on a hyperbolic surface contains a unique geodesic representative .",
    "a _ systole _ on a hyperbolic surface is a shortest simple closed geodesic on the surface .",
    "a straightforward cut - and - paste argument shows that a filling set of systoles on a surface is a @xmath26-filling set , and further that all curves in a filling set of systoles are nonseparating .",
    "as the title suggests , in this section we give a proof of our main theorem , theorem [ smallsets ] .",
    "for this we require lower and upper bounds for the size of a @xmath6-filling set of simple close curves .",
    "let @xmath27 be a set of @xmath10 curves satisfying the hypotheses of theorem [ smallsets ] for some fixed @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the compact surface whose interior is the complement of the union of the first @xmath29 curves @xmath30 on @xmath9 .",
    "then the euler characteristic @xmath31 of @xmath32 is at least one .    on @xmath28 ,",
    "the curve @xmath33 consists of the union of at most @xmath34 arcs whose endpoints correspond to intersections of @xmath33 with the first @xmath29 curves . deleting a single",
    "arc increases the euler characteristic by at most one . removing all arcs of @xmath33 , the euler characteristic of the resulting surface @xmath35 increases by at most @xmath34 .",
    "thus we have : @xmath36 rearranging the terms gives the inequality of theorem [ smallsets ] .",
    "for this we describe a @xmath6-filling set with cardinality @xmath12 or @xmath37 , described inductively in that the @xmath38 curve @xmath33 is given in terms of the previous @xmath39 .",
    "as should be apparent in what follows , a minimal such set is in no way unique , and the number of such sets ( up to homeomorphism ) grows with genus .",
    "part of the difficulty here is in making a choice for these curves in such a way that they can be described systematically , and it should be noted that we make no attempt to keep track of all possible sets of small cardinality .",
    "the curves described will in fact make up an @xmath40-filling set , where @xmath41 .",
    "this takes into account the relative sizes of @xmath6 and @xmath0 ; for in the case that @xmath0 is small relative to @xmath6 , the set is @xmath0-filling so that pairwise intersections between curves are fewer than required .",
    "this resolves difficulties in the construction for these cases .",
    "+      suppose that @xmath30 are the first @xmath29 curves chosen for our collection .",
    "recall that @xmath28 is the compact surface with boundary having interior @xmath42 .",

    "for @xmath63 , let @xmath64 be a point on @xmath58 , and @xmath65 a point on @xmath66 such that @xmath67 .    for @xmath68 , the base point of @xmath69 is @xmath70 , and the terminal point is @xmath71 ; the terminal point @xmath72 of @xmath73 is @xmath74 .",
    "the union @xmath75 then maps under @xmath76 to a simple closed curve @xmath77 .",
    "we choose the arcs so that @xmath78 is boundary cutting and each remaining arc @xmath69 , @xmath79 , is genus cutting .",
    "hence , the surface @xmath80 will have @xmath40 boundary components .",
    "the curve @xmath33 , @xmath55 , is considered an `` intermediate curve '' as long as the genus of @xmath28 is at least @xmath40 greater than the number of arcs @xmath52 which are boundary cutting in @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath28 has smaller genus , then @xmath33 is described as one of the `` last curves '' below .",

    "the first arc @xmath83 is based at a point @xmath84 in the interior of a component of @xmath85 which , when projected to @xmath47 , contains the base point @xmath86 of @xmath87 .",
    "once we define the terminal points , all of the base points are determined because the union @xmath88 mapping under @xmath89 to the closed curve @xmath33 , the arc @xmath81 must map under @xmath89 to the terminal point of another arc @xmath90 ; terminal points of arcs are described below . consequently forces relations between base points and terminal points of arcs .",
    "namely , when @xmath91 and @xmath92 , we define the arcs @xmath93 to be based at the points @xmath94    then for @xmath95 and @xmath96 , we define the arcs @xmath97 to be based at the points @xmath98 finally , we define the arcs @xmath81 , for @xmath95 and @xmath92 , to be based at the points @xmath99 we now describe the terminal points for these arcs ; these will depend on whether the arc in question is genus cutting or boundary cutting .",
    "we first describe how to terminate the arcs @xmath81 for @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "the notation @xmath103 will always indicate a thin collar neighbourhood of @xmath49 which does not contain the intersection of any two curves from the set @xmath104 .",

    "+ to show the second inequality , it suffices to exhibit an example of a surface with a filling set of systoles of cardinality @xmath204 . for @xmath205",
    ", one can construct a surface by pasting together , in an appropriate way , four copies of a regular right angled @xmath206-gon . note that for every @xmath0 , it is straightforward to establish that there is only one such polygon ; we denote its ( uniquely determined ) side length @xmath207 , and let @xmath29 denote the barycenter of the vertices .",
    "@xmath208 note that the distance in the interior of the polygon between any two nonadjacent edges is greater than @xmath207 ( and strictly greater if the two edges are more than one apart from being adjacent ) . to see this , consider any two such edges",
    "@xmath209 and @xmath210 , and the two paths , say @xmath211 and @xmath212 , of length @xmath213 between @xmath29 and the midpoint of these edges .",
    "the paths @xmath211 and @xmath212 plus the distance realizing path between @xmath209 and @xmath210 are part of a pentagon with right angles , except for the angle @xmath214 between @xmath211 and @xmath212 , where @xmath215 is the minimal number of edges between @xmath209 and @xmath210 . note that this pentagon is uniquely determined up to isometry by @xmath0 and @xmath215 .",
    "finally : for @xmath216 one obtains the distance @xmath207 calculated above , and the distance between @xmath209 and @xmath210 is a strictly increasing function in @xmath215 .",
    "+ in pairs , one glues the polygons along every second edge to obtain two @xmath217-holed spheres of boundary lengths all equal to @xmath218 .",
    "these spheres have a natural set of  seams \" corresponding to the edges of the polygons that have been pasted together .",
    "now one glues along the boundaries of the two surfaces such that the two end points of each seam are pasted exactly to the two end points of a same seam on the other holed sphere .",
    "there are now @xmath219 filling curves on the resulting surface of length @xmath220 .",
    "it suffices to see that these curves are systoles . to see this , note that any simple nontrivial simple",
    "closed curve not homotopic to one of the @xmath219 curves constructed above necessarily contains at least two arcs which join nonadjacent edges on one of the four polygons .",
    "as any such arc has length more than @xmath207 , this implies that any nontrivial simple closed curve has length more than @xmath220 .",
    "+ the surface we have constructed has @xmath219 systoles but it is easy to see that any subset of these systoles @xmath221 with intersection number @xmath222 for @xmath216 to @xmath223 fills , and that their complementary region is a ( right angled ) connected polygon .",
    "observe that the lower bound in the previous theorem implies that there are at most a finite number of genera for which the 1-filling sets constructed in the proof of theorem [ smallsets ] are realizable as systoles .",
    "+ let us conclude by remarking the following .",
    "families of surfaces with number of filling systoles of growth order @xmath224 are possibly quite difficult or impossible to find .",
    "the proof of theorem [ prop : sys ] shows that if such a family exists then the lengths of the systoles must grow at least like @xmath225 .",
    "although such families of surfaces are known to exist ( the first examples were found in @xcite ) , they are very difficult to construct and most known examples come from using arithmetic groups in some way . furthermore , the order of growth of the number of systoles for these families is at least linear .",
    "one would have to analyse the topology of the sets of systoles of such surfaces to see if there are filling subsets with less than linear growth ."
