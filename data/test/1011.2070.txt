    "the polcor instrument is a combined imager , coronograph and polarimeter built for the nordic optical telescope ( not ) .",
    "polcor provides sharp images ( resolution down to 02 ) , has a well - defined psf ( resulting in a higher image contrast ) and a high - quality polarimeter .",
    "+    we observed three sources using polcor / not : the binary s - type agb star w  aql , and the two detached shell carbon stars u  cam and dr  ser .",
    "observations of the polarized light around the stars trace the circumstellar dust distribution and thus enables the search for structures and asymmetries in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "though this study the geometry of the mass loss can be investigated which will give important clues not only to the processes at play , but also to the transition from the agb phase to the planetary nebula phase .",
    "the circumstellar dust distribution around the binary star w aql is mapped and found to be asymmetric , both on large ( 10  ) and on smaller ( 1  ) scales ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the large - scale images show what appears to be a dust - density enhancement on the south - west side of the star and the inner region appears bi - polar through the coronographic mask .",
    "these structures are in agreement with what could be expected from binary interaction ."
