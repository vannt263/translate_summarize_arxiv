    "diffuse emission from the milky way is , in fact , the brightest feature of the @xmath0-ray sky , as demonstrated by sas-2 @xcite , cos - b @xcite , the energetic gamma - ray experimental telescope ( egret ) onboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) _",
    "@xcite , and by the first - light results of _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _",
    "other than the milky way , the only star - forming galaxy detected in gamma - rays is the large magellanic cloud @xcite , because normal star - forming galaxies are individually faint in @xmath0-rays @xcite .",
    "however star - forming galaxies are very numerous , and their collective emission is likely to make a substantial contribution ( pavlidou & fields 2002 , hereafter pf02 ) to the cosmic gamma - ray background ( cgb ) , measured with egret @xcite .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard _ fermi _ will further refine the cgb measurement with improved energy and angular resolutions , whereas it will only detect no more than three additional galaxies as individual sources ( small magellanic cloud , m  31 , and maybe m  33 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , normal galaxies would be a guaranteed source of the cgb for _ fermi_-lat , and their contribution would be at essentially the same level as it was for egret .",
    "other contributors such as blazars , on the other hand , will be substantially reduced with respect to their fractional contributions to the egret cgb @xcite , as the _ fermi_-lat will resolve many of them ( @xmath31000 , depending on the luminosity function ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "normal galaxies also have a characteristic spectral feature  a peak , tracing the hadronic origin of their emission . as a result ,",
    "when the ( more spectrally featureless ) blazar contribution is reduced , the contribution from normal galaxies to the cgb could be dominant at energies around a few hundred mev ( pf02),1 gev , this result was a consequence of the `` gev excess '' in the egret measurement of the milky - way spectrum which recent _ fermi _ observations in mid - galactic - latitudes have not reproduced ( johannesson & fermi lat collaboration 2009 ; @xcite ) implying it was likely an instrumental effect . in this work",
    ", we use a milky - way spectrum compatible with no gev excess and find the normal galaxy peak to reside at lower energies ( see   [ intensity ] ) . ] which allows for an almost contamination - free set of photons .",
    "galaxies are clustered following the large - scale matter distribution in the universe , and this clustering feature should be imprinted on the cgb .",
    "the anisotropy of the cgb has recently been studied theoretically by a number of authors , in order to look for signatures of various contributing sources such as blazars @xcite , galaxy clusters @xcite , type ia supernovae @xcite , and dark - matter annihilation @xcite .",
    "the same approach should also be taken for the normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "should this signature be detected in the _",
    "fermi_-lat data , it would be extremely useful in a variety of ways :    1 .   as a consistency check.if an energy range",
    "is identified spectrally where the normal - galaxy contribution to the cgb is believed to be strongly dominant , then the cgb photons in this range _ must _ exhibit anisotropy properties consistent with our understanding of normal - galaxy clustering .",
    "2 .   as a powerful tool to disentangle multiple cgb components.instead of having the cgb strongly dominated by normal galaxies in some energy range ,",
    "an equally likely scenario is to have a balanced mixture of normal galaxy photons and photons from different source classes . in this case , as much information as possible is needed to disentangle the different cgb contributions . in this context , the angular power spectrum is as important a clue as the shape of the energy spectrum of the contributions from different populations ( see , e.g. , @xcite on how the two can be combined when information from the energy spectrum alone is insufficient to break the degeneracy between different components ) .",
    "the importance of the angular power spectrum in the case of normal galaxies is further emphasized because their clustering properties are very well constrained through galaxy surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "3 .   as a complement to anisotropy studies of other populations.as normal galaxies provide a guaranteed contribution to the cgb for _ fermi_-lat",
    ", the cgb anisotropy due to normal galaxies is also a guaranteed background to any anisotropies studies using the diffuse background .",
    "for this reason , it is important to calculate the anisotropy properties of the normal galaxy signal and understand its uncertainties and its sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions .    in this paper",
    ", we seek to calculate the expected angular correlation of the cgb signature due to @xmath0-ray emitting normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "we consider two quantities : the angular auto - power spectrum of the cgb ( @xmath4 ) and the angular cross - power spectrum between the cgb map and some galaxy catalog ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "an advantage of the auto - power spectrum analysis is that it can be performed immediately after _",
    "fermi_-lat has obtained a sufficiently deep all - sky @xmath0-ray map , with @xmath0-ray data alone . as such",
    ", it does not suffer from uncertainties introduced through the use of galaxy catalogs , such as issues of completeness and dust corrections . on the other hand ,",
    "even given the additional uncertainties mentioned above , taking the cross - correlation between the cgb map and a galaxy catalog provides , as it turns out , a better way to detect the normal galaxy angular signature , because of the large statistics of the large - scale galaxy surveys .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in   [ intensity ] , we discuss the model we adopt to calculate the contribution of normal star - forming galaxies to the @xmath0-ray background . in",
    "  [ autospectrum ] , we calculate the predicted angular auto - power spectrum form star - forming galaxies , and in   [ crossspectrum ] we discuss the cross - correlation between the normal - galaxy component of the cgb and galaxy catalogs .",
    "we summarize and discuss our conclusions in   [ discussion ] .",
    "we follow pf02 to derive a formulation for the mean cgb intensity from normal galaxies .",
    "we adopt their assumptions , and update our calculation with more recent determinations of the cosmic star - formation history and of the milky - way @xmath0-ray spectrum .",

    "the emissivity is then @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the global star - formation - rate density .- ray emissivity at a certain redshift comes from galaxies with similar @xmath0-ray properties ; it is the properties of that typical galaxy that evolve with cosmic time according to the product of the cosmic star - formation rate and the gas - mass fraction histories . ] now , assuming that the sum of gas mass and star mass is constant in the typical galaxy , the gas - mass fraction is simply given by @xmath16 thus , given the cosmic history of the star - formation - rate density , one could compute @xmath11 by backwards de - evolving the present - day milky - way gas mass fraction , @xmath17 .",
    "the assumption of a total baryonic mass of galaxies staying constant in time is not necessarily realistic , as star formation is partly fueled by newly accreted gas @xcite .",
    "however , the overall effect of the details of the gas fraction evolution is relatively small ( @xmath1factor of two , pf02 ) . a more realistic modeling of the evolving gas fraction , including the effects of infall , will be addressed in an upcoming publication .    for the present study",

    "the galaxy contribution appears to be important in particular for energies between 50 mev and 1 gev .",
    "we point out that due to the shift of the spectral break in the milky - way diffuse emission spectrum from 850 mev ( which was the location of the break in egret data which suffered from the gev excess ) to 600 mev ( the location of the break in galprop conventional ) , the peak of the normal galaxy contribution correspondingly shifted from @xmath1500 mev in pf02 to @xmath1250 mev in fig .",

    "a notable exception to this general rule is that of starburst galaxies , which , depending on the details of cosmic ray confinement , could individually be one to two orders of magnitude brighter in @xmath0-rays than the typical milky - way  like galaxy of the same cosmic epoch , as well as have harder energy spectra at high energies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however starburst galaxies would be best treated as a distinct source class as far as their anisotropy properties are concerned  compared to normal star - forming galaxies , the population of starburst galaxies consists of few and bright sources , and the anisotropy at small angular scales could be considerably stronger , even if the overall contribution of starbursts to the cgb is lower .",

    "although we fixed the galaxy bias to be @xmath112 throughout @xcite , the relevant value of the bias might be different .",
    "this is because while @xmath113 refers to all galaxies , we are not interested in elliptical galaxies , faint dwarfs , or gas - poor dwarfs , which do not emit significant amount of @xmath0-rays .",

    "<S> star - forming galaxies are predicted to contribute considerably to the cosmic gamma - ray background ( cgb ) as they are confirmed @xmath0-ray emitters and are the most numerous population of @xmath0-ray sources , although individually faint . </S>",
    "<S> even though the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ will be able to resolve few star - forming galaxies individually , their fractional contribution to the cgb should become far more significant than it was for past measurements of the cgb as many of the brighter , formerly unresolved sources will be resolved out . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the clustering feature of galaxies imprinted on the cgb might be detectable by _ fermi_. in anticipation of such measurements , we calculate the predicted angular auto - power and cross - power spectra of the cgb from normal galaxies . we find that the amplitude of the auto - power spectrum is smaller than that for other sources such as blazars and dark - matter annihilation ; the shape is also characteristic . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the cross - power spectrum with galaxy surveys features larger amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> _ fermi _ should be able to detect the correlation signature in both the auto - power and cross - power spectra at angular scales of @xmath1110@xmath2 after 5-yr of operation . </S>",
    "<S> such a detection would be valuable in confirming the level of the star - forming galaxy contribution to the cgb , and more importantly , in serving as a tool in the effort to discriminate between possible origins of the cgb .    </S>",
