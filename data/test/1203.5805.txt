    "there has been much interest in superconductivity with very short coherence length .",
    "this interest is due to its possible relevance to high temperature superconductors ( cuprates , doped bismuthates , iron - based systems , fullerenes ) and also to the several other exotic superconducting materials ( for a review , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it can also give relevant insight into behaviour of strongly bounded fermion pairs on the optical lattices .",
    "the phase separations involving superconducting states have been evidenced in a  broad range of currently intensely investigated materials including iron - pnictides , cuprates and organic conductors ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .    in our work we will study a  model which is a  simple generalization of the standard model of a local pair superconductor with on - site pairing ( i.  e. the model of hard core bosons on a  lattice @xcite ) to the case of finite pair binding energy .",
    "the hamiltonian considered has the following form : @xmath4 where , , ; @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) denotes the annihilation ( creation ) operator of an electron with spin at the site @xmath7 , which satisfy canonical anticommutation relations @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the kronecker delta . indicates the sum over nearest - neighbour sites @xmath7 and @xmath10 independently .",
    "@xmath11 will denote the number of nearest neighbours .",
    "@xmath3 is the chemical potential , depending on the concentration of electrons : @xmath12 with and @xmath13 is the total number of lattice sites .",
    "there are two interaction parameters of the model : ( i )  the intersite pair hopping interaction @xmath1 , determining the electron pair mobility and responsible for the long - range superconducting order in the system and ( ii )  the on - site density - density interaction @xmath0 , which contributes ( together with @xmath1 ) to the pair binding energy by reducing ( ) or enhancing ( ) its value . to simplify our analysis",
    "we do not include in hamiltonian ( [ row : ham1 ] ) the single electron hopping term ( @xmath14 ) as well as other inter - site interaction terms .",
    "this assumption corresponds to the situation when the single particle mobility is much smaller than the pair mobility and can be neglected . in the presence of the @xmath14 term , model ( [ row : ham1 ] ) is called the penson - kolb - hubbard ( pkh ) model @xcite and the effects of will be pointed out in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .    model ( [ row : ham1 ] ) can be considered as a  relatively simple , effective model of a  superconductor with local electron pairing . moreover",
    ", the knowledge of the limit can be used as starting point for a perturbation expansion in powers of the hopping @xmath14 and provides a benchmark for various approximate approaches analyzing the corresponding finite bandwidth models .    in terms of pseudospin charge operators hamiltonian ( [ row : ham1 ] ) takes the form of a special xy - model with a  single ion anisotropy in a  transverse field ( in the @xmath11-direction ) @xmath15 where and corresponds to the external magnetic field .",
    "the operators satisfy standard commutation relations for momentum operators : @xmath16 = \\pm \\hat{\\rho}^\\pm_i \\delta_{ij } , \\qquad [ \\hat{\\rho}_i^{+ } , \\hat{\\rho}_j^{- } ] = 2\\hat{\\rho}_i^{z}\\delta_{ij},\\ ] ] what follows directly from  ( [ row : antycomutation ] ) .",
    "however , one should stress that takes on four values , as for model with doubly degenerated @xmath17 value , whereas , as in the system .",
    "condition ( [ row : condn1 ] ) for the electron concentration reads : @xmath18 it means that magnetic field @xmath19 is determined by a  fixed value of magnetization @xmath20 .",
    "the interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be treated as the effective ones and will be assumed to include all the possible contributions and renormalizations like those coming from the strong electron - phonon coupling or from the coupling between electrons and other electronic subsystems in solid or chemical complexes @xcite .",
    "in such a general case arbitrary values and signs of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are important to consider .",
    "it is notable that formally @xmath1 is one of the off - diagonal terms of the coulomb interaction  @xcite , describing a part of the so - called bond - charge interaction , and it sign of the _ coulomb - driven _",
    "charge exchange is typically negative ( repulsive , ) .",
    "however , the effective attractive of this form ( ) is also possible  @xcite and in particular it can originate from the coupling of electrons with intersite ( intermolecular ) vibrations via modulation of the hopping integral  @xcite , or from the on - site hybridization term in generalized periodic anderson model  @xcite .",
    "the ferromagnetic xy order of pseudospins @xmath21 ( for ) corresponds to the ss phase ( @xmath22-pairing superconducting ) , whereas the antiferromagnetic xy order ( for )  to the @xmath23s phase ( @xmath23-pairing superconducting ) .",
    "however , in the absence of the external field in the xy - direction conjugated with the order parameter ( , for and , for , @xmath24 is a  half of the smallest reciprocal lattice vector ) there is a symmetry between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases ( except for an obvious redefinition of the order parameter ) for lattices consisting of two interpenetrating sublattices ( such as for example sc or bcc lattices ) , thus we restrict ourselves to the case in the following .",
    "let us stress that the symmetry is broken by the single electron hopping term ( cf . section  [ sec : conclusions ] ) .    the first analysis of the phase diagram of model ( [ row : ham1 ] ) have been performed by bari  @xcite and ho and barry  @xcite using the variational method in order to examine the instability of the mott insulator to superconductivity for the special case of the half - filled band ( ) .",
    "the effects of diagonal disorder on the critical temperature for and have been also determined  @xcite , arriving at a  satisfactory qualitative interpretation of quite a number of different experiments in amorphous superconductors .    in the analysis we have adopted the variational approach ( va ) which treats the on - site interaction @xmath0 exactly and the intersite interactions @xmath1 within the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "we have also derived exact ground state results for a  linear chain ( ) .",

    "the phase diagrams of model ( [ row : ham1 ] ) have been investigated in  @xcite as a function of the electron concentration @xmath2 , but the stability conditions of states with phase separation have not been discussed .    in this paper , we investigate the thermodynamic properties of model hamiltonian ( [ row : ham1 ] ) for arbitrary chemical potential and arbitrary electron concentration .",
    "we focus on the states with phase separation , which have not been analyzed till now .",
    "arbitrary values of on - site interaction @xmath0 are considered and the range of pair hopping interaction @xmath1 is restricted to the nearest neighbours .",
    "our investigation of the general case finds that , depending on the values of the interaction parameters and the electron concentration , the system can exhibit the superconducting ordered and nonordered homogeneous phases as well as the phase separation between them .",
    "transitions between various states and phases can be continuous and discontinuous , what implies existence of tricritical points on the phase diagrams .",

    "taking into account the phase separated states and presenting several new results for lattices of various dimensions derived beyond va ( rigorous solution for a  chain ( ) , rpa for sq and sc lattices and lde in ) our paper substantially extends and generalizes the results and conclusions of previous papers concerning the model considered  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "section  [ sec : kt ] is devoted to the study of the finite temperature phase diagrams derived within the va as a function of @xmath3 ( section  [ sec : ktmi ] ) and as a function of @xmath2 ( section  [ sec : ktn ] ) .",
    "some particular temperature dependencies of the thermodynamic parameters are discussed in section  [ sec : properties ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to conclusions and supplementary discussion .",
    "the appendices report some relevant details : explicit expressions of site - dependent self - consistent va equations ( [ app : sitedependentequations ] ) , particle - hole transformations ( [ app : sym ] ) , and selected analytical va results ( [ app : anal ] ) .",
    "the free energy of the system as well as the self - consistent equations for the average number of electrons in the system and the average value of the order parameter are derived within site - dependent va in appendix [ app : sitedependentequations ] . restricting our analysis to the nearest neighbours and assuming no spatial variations of the order parameter the grand potential per site obtained in va is given by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the free energy per site : is derived as @xmath28 the grand potential @xmath29 is minimized in the system considered for fixed @xmath3 , whereas the free energy @xmath30 takes the minimum when @xmath2 is fixed .",
    "the condition for electron concentration ( [ row : condn1 ] ) and a  minimization of @xmath29 ( or @xmath30 ) with respect to the superconducting order parameter @xmath31 lead to the following self - consistent equations ( for homogeneous phases ) : @xmath32.\\ ] ] we also introduce the concentration of locally paired electrons and the ratio . notice that @xmath33 is different from the condensate density ( a  fraction of pairs in the condensate ) @xmath34 .",

    "the superconducting phase ( ss ) is characterized by non - zero value of @xmath31 , whereas in the non - ordered ( normal ) phase ( no ) .",

    "we say that the solution of ( [ row : mfa1])([row : mfa2 ] ) corresponds to a  metastable phase if it corresponds to a  minimum of the free energy @xmath30 or grand potential @xmath29 and the stability condition @xmath35 is fulfilled .",
    "otherwise , we say that the phase is unstable .",
    "a  stable ( homogeneous ) phase is a  metastable phase with the lowest free energy ( among all metastable phases and the phase separated states described below ) .",

    "it implies that the transitions with a  discontinuous change of @xmath2 in the system considered for fixed @xmath3 can lead to occurrence of the regions of phase separation in the concentration range on the diagrams obtained as a function of @xmath2 . in these regions the homogeneous phases can be metastable as well as unstable , depending on the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath3 ( cf .",

    "we refer the reader to existing literature , e.  g.  @xcite .    in the model",
    "considered only one type of ps states can occur , which is a coexistence of ss and no phases .    in the paper",
    "we have used the following convention .",
    "a  second ( first ) order transition is a  transition between homogeneous phases with a  ( dis-)continuous change of the order parameter at the transition temperature . a  transition between a  homogeneous phase and the ps state is symbolically named as a  `` third order '' transition .",
    "at this transition a  size of one domain in the ps state decreases continuously to zero at the  transition temperature .",
    "second order transitions are denoted by solid lines on phase diagrams , whereas dotted and dashed curves denote first order and `` third order '' transitions , respectively .",
    "the phase diagrams obtained are symmetric with respect to half - filling because of the particle - hole symmetry of hamiltonian ( [ row : ham1 ] ) , so the diagrams will be presented only in the range and .",

    "let us consider the ground state ( gs ) of model ( [ row : ham1 ] ) .    in the absence of @xmath14 term , the parity of the number of particles at each site is a  good quantum number .",

    "the system is a collection of _ even _ segments , within which pairs are confined ( the subspace with excluded singly occupied sites ) interleaved by _ odd",
    "_ segments ( the subspace with excluded doubly occupied sites ) .    since , the interfaces between the _ odd _ and _ even _ regions will cost energy , so in the thermodynamic limit the ground state will be either a  single infinitely large _ even _ segment or a  single _ odd _ segment for fixed @xmath3 . only in the case when the grand potentials per site ( it is the chemical potential ) of the segments are equal there",

    "the situation is different when @xmath2 is fixed . in such case",
    "the ps states can occur in definite ranges of @xmath2 .",
    "the reason for this can be explained as the following .",
    "let the energy of a single boundary ( interface ) between _ odd _ and _ even _ segments be .",
    "if the number of intersite boundaries will increase as @xmath46 ( where ) the contribution from them to the total free energy disappears in the thermodynamic limit .    within the subspace excluding the double occupancy of sites ( by electrons for or holes for ) the product for any , i.  e. the @xmath1 term does not contribute .",
    "effective hamiltonian ( [ row : ham1 ] ) for this case takes the form and the calculations of the gs grand potential and the gs energy are quite obvious . as a result in the limit from ( [ row : freeenergy ] ) and ( [ row : mfa1 ] ) one obtains for fixed @xmath2 in the no phase : @xmath47 this gs is infinitely degenerate for .",
