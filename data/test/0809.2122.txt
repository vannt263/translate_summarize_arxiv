    "when a wave propagates with a low energy in a quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) wave guide with an uniform cross section , the guide is effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) since only the first transverse mode plays a role .",
    "however , when a guide comprises discontinuities such as bends and branching junctions , higher transverse modes come into play at the vicinity of the discontinuities .",
    "therefore , in principle , a full - mode or full - wave analysis is required , which means a substantial increase in the amount of calculation and the physics is often obscured .",
    "knowing that the guide is essentially 1d in the uniform sections , such a full - wave analysis for the entire system is actually unnecessary .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present a scheme to eliminate those redundancies and simplify the calculations , yet have those low - energy properties faithfully preserved .",
    "historically , there has been a number of schemes related to this purpose .",
    "the earliest one was due to kuhn and dates back to 1949 @xcite .",
    "then it was made more well - known by griffith in 1953 @xcite , and henceforth it has been called the griffith boundary condition @xcite .",
    "the scheme contains a set of equations relating the wave functions and their first derivatives on the lines connected to a junction @xcite .",
    "the equations are simple equations that satisfy the unitarity condition at the junction .",
    "the scheme has been intuitively stated and has no undetermined parameters . however , recently it has been pointed out by the author @xmath0 @xcite that it is not clear what kind of realistic q1d guides the scheme describes . later than kuhn , there was another scheme by shapiro in 1983 @xcite .",
    "the scheme starts by an unitary matrix relating the amplitudes of the inward and outward waves @xcite .",
    "though this scheme contains free parameters , it also has not been mentioned how the parameters are related to the guides in realistic spaces .    to the present , approaches to the related problems are belong to either one of the mentioned two categories @xcite . and",
    "a common feature of most of the schemes @xcite is that the relation between the reduced systems and the original systems is not addressed , and this hinders the application to the study of realistic systems .    in 2006 , the author _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a scheme @xcite , which has been the first attempt to relate reduced and unreduced systems .",
    "the scheme resembles that by kuhn @xcite , but has an extra phenomenological term with a tuning parameter .",
    "the parameter is to be fixed by a comparison between results from the reduced and unreduced systems .",
    "the scheme was shown to be a substantial improvement , and many low - energy transport properties were shown to be captured . but still , it is pointed out later in this paper that this simple phenomenology can be inadequate and a more general scheme is needed .",
    "section [ form ] illustrates the derivation of the connecting equations to be used in reduced systems , for two typical component structures  the l - bend and the t - junction . then in sec .",
    "[ examples ] , these two structures are assembled into more elaborated structures , and the wave propagation in the structures are studied in and compared between , the reduced and unreduced systems . in sec .",
    "[ conc ] , a few concluding remarks are given .",
    "the scheme to be proposed can be summarized as in the following . for a particular discontinuity",
    ", the scattering matrix ( @xmath1-matrix ) is evaluated using a full - wave treatment , and then the matrix is truncated leaving only those elements relating the first transverse modes in the branch guides .",
    "the truncated @xmath1-matrix is then used to connect the 1d wave functions in reduced systems .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) time - independent schr@xmath2dinger equation ( tise ) @xmath3 [ \\partial_x ^2 \\psi + \\partial_y ^2 \\psi ] + v(x , y ) \\psi = e \\psi$ ] , with @xmath4 and hard wall boundaries is considered . for a wave with an energy @xmath5 in a guide having a width @xmath6",
    ", the wave function can be written as a sum of direct products of transverse modes and longitudinal waves .",
    "labeling the guide by @xmath7 and defining a coordinate system @xmath8 in the guide , where @xmath9 is in the longitudinal direction and @xmath10 is in the transverse direction ( @xmath11 ) , the wave function can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the longitudinal wave number for the @xmath14-th transverse mode , which can be propagating or evanescent , and @xmath15 is a large enough integer . in a 1d space ,",

    "the wave function for @xmath17 is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the longitudinal wave number given by @xmath20 .",
    "when results from 2d guides and 1d lines are compared , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is compared with @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 is compared with @xmath19 .",

    "[ discontinuities](a ) and [ discontinuities](b ) respectively .",

    "<S> a scheme to reduce translational noninvariant quasi - one - dimensional wave guides into singly or multiply connected one - dimensional ( 1d ) lines is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> it is meant to simplify the analysis of wave guides , with the low - energy properties of the guides preserved . </S>",
    "<S> guides comprising uniform - cross - sectional sections and discontinuities such as bends and branching junctions are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the uniform sections are treated as 1d lines , and the discontinuities are described by equations sets connecting the wave functions on the lines . the procedures to derive the equations and to solve reduced systems are illustrated by examples , and the scheme is found to apply when the discontinuities are distant and </S>",
    "<S> the energy is low . </S>",
    "<S> when the scheme applies , it may substantially simplify the analysis of a wave guide , and hence the scheme may find uses in the study of related problems , such as quantum wire networks .    </S>",
