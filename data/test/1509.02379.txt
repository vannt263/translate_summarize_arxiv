    ", radiation detectors can be quite expensive .",
    "commercial detectors also do not offer as extensive learning factors as the `` do it yourself '' equipment does . in this article",
    "we discuss how a gaseous proportional counter can be built and used to acquire @xmath0- and @xmath1-ray spectra from radioactive sources .    a gaseous proportional counter @xcite operates with the same principle as an ionization chamber @xcite with the additional feature of gas amplification .",

    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the radial electric field between the cathode and the anode is generated by applying positive high voltage ( hv ) to the anode .",
    "a photon or a charged particle that enters the chamber , ionizes the gas and the electrons ( ions ) move towards to the anode ( cathode ) and induce an electric current .",
    "the electric field strength in a cylindrical detector can be approximated by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the applied potential , @xmath4 is the inner radius of the cathode tube , and @xmath5 is the outer radius of the anode wire . if the applied voltage is high enough , a sufficiently strong electric field of around @xmath6  kv / cm will be generated close to the anode wire and secondary ionization and townsend avalanches will occur in this region.@xcite this process is commonly referred to as gas amplification .",
    "figure  [ fig02 ] illustrates this process .",
    "it shows the result of a simulation of our detector using garfield@xmath7,@xcite a toolkit for simulation of gas and semi - conductor based particle detectors .",
    "the path of the drifting electron that results from the ionizing process is shown in white .",
    "close to the anode ( @xmath8 ) the townsend avalanche ignites .",
    "the positive ions that drift towards the cathode are shown in orange .",
    "the term `` proportional '' indicates that the total number of electron - ion pairs is proportional to the number of primary electron - ion pairs created by the incident radiation .",
    "the energy of the incident radiation can only be measured if exactly one avalanche occurs per primary electron - ion pair .",
    "a special gas mixture , mainly consisting of a noble gas , is used for optimal performance .",
    "noble gasses can be excited and emit photons that can release electrons from the detector material through the photoelectric effect .",
    "these electrons cause additional avalanches that distort the primary signal . to suppress such spurious pulses , some molecular anti - quenching gas , such as co@xmath9 or methane , is added .    the avalanche electrons drift to the anode rather quickly ( @xmath10  ns ) compared to the much slower positive ions ( @xmath11  @xmath12s ) .",
    "this leads to a fast rise of the signal caused by the electrons and a much slower rise caused by the ions .",
    "the amount of the induced charge by the electrons is very small compared to the amount induced by the ions.@xcite    if a very high voltage is applied to the proportional counter it operates as a geiger - mller counter . in this regime",
    ", each primary electron - ion pair will not only create an avalanche but also high - energetic photons that are emitted by excited atoms .",
    "this causes a full electric discharge that can be easily processed with simple electronics .",

    "operational equipment , such as the hv - supply , the oscilloscope , and the amplifier , are assumed to be available to the reader .",

    "the interested reader is referred to publications@xcite or websites specialized on these topics .",
    "the motivation for a radiation detector made of an aluminium beverage can is to build a properly working device at minimal costs .",
    "similar approaches have been proposed in the past@xcite but have become partially impracticable due to the availability of suggested parts and the crude data quality these devices offer .",
    "our approach follows the design of moljk and drever,@xcite but uses materials that are available in today s society .",
    "in addition , our design significantly improves the performance of the device .",
    "a good option for a cheap conducting cathode tube is a conventional aluminium beverage can.@xcite the wall thickness is thin enough for low energetic @xmath1- and @xmath0-rays to enter the gas volume and no additional _ entrance - window _ , as used by moljk and drever,@xcite is needed for operation .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig03 ]        which shows the ratio of the transmitted photon intensity @xmath13 after passing through detector materials and the incident photon intensity @xmath14 as function of photon energy .",
    "the black curve shows the results of absorption in the thin aluminium can wall and the red curve the absorption in 6 cm of argon gas .",
    "multiplying these two curves gives an rough estimate of the detector efficiency .",
    "the photon energies of interest are between 5 and 60 kev .",
    "these energies are high enough to enter the detector through the can wall and low enough for some of the photons to be absorbed in the gas .",
    "the parts used for our assembly are listed in table  [ tab01 ] .",
    "our detector was designed and built from scratch without the use of prefabricated components .",
    "the beverage can was carefully opened from the top side with a hole saw . a small area on the outside of the can was roughened with sandpaper to expose the bare aluminium .",
    "it is recommended to remove the polymer coating inside the can for better detector performance .",
    "however , in our case the coating was not removed .",
    "acrylglass covers were used as end - caps of the can .",
    "holes for the anode wire and the gas supply were drilled in the bottom side of the can and in the acrylglass covers .",
    "the diameter of the holes were chosen to be of the size of the nylon screws , m5 for the anode holes and m8 for the gas supply holes .",
    "another hole was drilled into the can wall close to the opening to attach a firm ground connection for the cathode cable .",
    "the central cores of the the nylon screws were removed to hold the brass tubes that support the anode wire and the gas supply lines .",

    "the nylon screws used to hold the gas supply lines were put in place first . another nylon screw to hold the anode wire was fixed to the bottom of the can . this provides electrical insulation for the brass tube that supports the anode wire and keeps the anode wire centered inside the can .",
    "our experience has shown that it is best to first put the anode wire carefully through the brass tube and then solder the brass tube to the hv - connector .",
    "the thin anode wire was obtained by taking a single strand from a conventional head - phone cable .",
    "the drawback of this approach is a larger wire diameter and uneven fabrication compared to e.g. professional beryllium - copper wires with a diameter of 50  @xmath12 m or less .",
    "the effect of the thicker wire can be compensated with higher operational voltages .",
    "the can was closed and tightened after pulling the wire carefully through the brass tube at the opposite end .",
    "rubber was used between the can and the acrylic end - caps . since the rubber might not be sufficiently gas - tight , two part epoxy adhesives was applied to the end - caps to ensure gas - tightness .",
    "the detector was gas tight 24  h after the application of the epoxy .",
    "the anode wire was soldered to the brass tube on the bottom of the can after straightening it carefully and the screw - on socket for the cathode cable was installed .",
    "the gas supply tubes were connected and all possible areas of gas leakage were sealed with epoxy adhesive . to connect the cathode , a low voltage cable , @xmath16 mm , was soldered to the metal casing of the hv - connector . a mini banana plug was attached to the other end of the cable to connect it to the socket attached to the can wall .",
    "these cables are visible in the pictures in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] . in the left picture",
    "the red high voltage connection is visible on the right - hand side . on the left - hand side of the right picture , the black cable providing the ground connection to the cathode is visible .",
    "discharge can occur if a non - hv rated cable is used for the anode connection since most non - hv rated cables are only rated up to 500  v and a discharge between hv and ground can occur above that limit . in our original setup",
    "this happened immediately after reaching 600  v. we decided to remove the anode cable and solder the hv - connector directly onto the anode wire outlet , as can be seen in the picture on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] .",
    "this also reduces the noise level and increases the simplicity of the detector .",
    "the quality of the cathode cable does not impact to the operation of the detector .",
    "the detector was flushed over - night with a p10 gas mixture ( ar 90  % / methane 10  % ) to remove oxygen , which is highly electronegative and captures some of the primary electrons from the ionization process .",
    "even though some electrons will reach the avalanche region close to the anode , the loss of primary electrons would result in a loss of the proportional character of the counter .",
    "the gas flow during the night was set to @xmath21  ml / min .",
    "the gas outlet of the detector is either vented into the atmosphere or connected to a gas - recycling circuit , if available .",
    "additional beverage can detectors can be connecting in series , but the flushing - time will increase with each added device . if the gas is vented into the atmosphere , the gas outlet tube should be at least a couple of centimeters long to prevent back - flow diffusion .    for the measurement an analog oscilloscope ( hp cos 6100 , 100  mhz ) , a pre - amplifier ( ortec pre amp 142 ih ) , a linear spectrum amplifier ( ortec 855 dual spec amp ) , a pulse generator ( bnc pulse generator model bl-2 ) , a high voltage supply ( @xmath22 silena milano ) , and a multi - channel - analyzer ( pocket mca , amptek ) were used .",
    "the experimental setup is shown schematically in fig.[fig05 ] .",
    "the ortec pre - amplifier uses capacitive decoupling to separate the signal from the hv . if the pre - amplifier does not have an integrated capacitive decoupling of hv and signal it is easy to build a separate decoupling box using the circuit shown in fig.[fig06 ] .",
    "the linear amplifier provided gains between 5 and 1200 .",

    "an essential part of the operational preparations is noise reduction .",
    "standard aluminium kitchen foil proved to be highly effective for shielding .",
    "for the noise study , the hv was slowly ramped up to values well above 1  kv , while the gas flow through the detector was kept constant at @xmath24  ml / min of p10 .",
    "the noise was observed with the oscilloscope and aluminium foil was wrapped around the end - caps of the detector .",
    "a firm contact to the cathode ( ground ) was obtained with self - adhesive conducting copper - tape .",
    "this reduced the noise to amplitudes below 100  mv for a gain of 120 .",
    "we used @xmath25fe and @xmath26am isotopes to test the detector .",
    "the latter can be obtained from commercial ionizing smoke detectors.@xcite for our measurements , the sources were put on top of the detector .",

    "[ fig07],scaledwidth=32.0% ]    the analysis of the measured data can be done manually , with spreadsheet programs , or with scientific software such as root , a freely available object - oriented data analysis framework@xcite that was used in our case .",
    "to calibrate the electronics a negative test signal from the pulse generator was sent to the pre - amplifier and the oscilloscope . the test signal was a tail pulse with a steep falling edge and a slow rise .",
    "a negative pulse was used since the signal from the anode wire of the proportional counter is negative .",
    "the amplitude of the test pulse was measured with the oscilloscope .",
    "the response of the electronic chain was recorded with the mca .",
    "a gain factor of 120 was used during the calibration process .    during the electronics calibrations ,",
    "the detector was connected to the pre - amplifier and the bias voltage was set to zero . for accurate calibrations , all devices that are used for the measurements should be connected and turned on .",

    "apart from the statistical uncertainties , systematic uncertainties were also taken into account and standard textbook error propagation techniques were used.@xcite    systematic errors are associated with the hv power supply , the amplification chain , and the mca .",
    "the instability of the silena milano power supply was estimated to be 1  v. the corresponding uncertainty in terms of mca channels is estimated by using the result of the operation region test ( see fig .",

    "is expected .",
    "our recorded spectrum reveals a possible peak around 10  kev ( peak 4 ) , but no clear evidence is found without applying a thorough background subtraction .",
    "it should be mentioned that the detection efficiencies for the transitions in the energy spectra are energy dependent .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig03 ] , low - energy photons have a higher attenuation in the aluminium can wall than high - energy photons .",
    "the effect of attenuation can be corrected using the efficiency distribution shown in fig.[fig03 ] .",
    "to reveal the full potential of the detector , the operational hv region was scanned in order to understand its proportionality behavior and measure the gas gain .",
    "the idea was to measure the prominent characteristic peaks of the two isotopes over the full operational voltage range available.@xcite the location of the peaks observed with the mca were converted into induced charge on the anode wire , using the electronics calibration function shown in fig.[fig08 ] .",

    "a recording time of @xmath48  200  s was sufficient to acquire just enough statistics to resolve the characteristic peaks and short enough to finish the measurement in reasonable time .",
    "we recorded data for voltage steps of 50 to 100  v until we reached the minimum gain of the amplification chain and the upper limit of the mca range .",
    "next , @xmath26am was used with its characteristic @xmath1-ray emission at a ten times higher energy than the characteristic @xmath25fe @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "this allowed us not only to extend the scan of the operational range but also to show the proportional character of the detector .",
    "the observed charge curve obtained with @xmath26am should be shifted upwards and be parallel to the curve obtained with @xmath25fe .",
    "again , spectra were recorded in steps of 50 or 100  v over the whole amplification range .",
    "the measurement started with the maximum gain and a bias voltage of @xmath56  kv , at which one still was able to identify the peak signal on the oscilloscope .",
    "for all the recorded spectra the characteristic peaks and their details were extracted .",
    "the centroids of the peaks were converted into total charge or the number readout electrons using the measured electronics calibration function .",

    "in addition to the uncertainties already discussed , the errors include the effect of a 5  v uncertainty of the manual setup of the hv power supply .",
    "the proportional character of the detector is consistent with the data shown in fig.[fig12 ] .",
    "plotted on a logarithmic scale , the proportional operational region is the linear part of the curves .",
    "the curves shown in fig.[fig12 ] .",
    "are almost parallel and shifted by a factor close to 10 , which is expected as the characteristic isotope peaks are a factor of 10 apart in terms of energy . with about 26  ev needed to create an electron - ion pair in argon gas , we can estimate the gas multiplication factor knowing the energy of the incident @xmath0- or @xmath1-rays .",

    "constant discharge was observed , including a glow around the anode wire , and sparks within the gas volume were observed through the acrylglass end - cap window .",
    "afterwards , the detector was not able to measure any radiation even at voltages around 1.4  kv .",

    "<S> . these devices can be as simple as a cylindrical cathode and a very thin anode wire centered along its axis . by applying a high voltage , a strong electric field </S>",
    "<S> is generated close to the anode wire . </S>",
    "<S> ion - pairs , generated by passing ionizing radiation , create avalanches once they drift into the strong electric field region near the anode . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical charges created by the avalanche generate an observable signal which is proportional to the energy loss of the incoming radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the construction of such a device . </S>",
    "<S> our detector was built from an ordinary aluminium beverage can and uses a common electric wire strand as the anode . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of this detector offers students at universities or technically oriented high schools a detailed understanding of the design and operation of gaseous radiation detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the equipment required to complete the project should be available at most institutions . </S>"
