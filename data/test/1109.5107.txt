    "macroscopic objects in contact with an ionized gas acquire a negative charge because the influx of electrons from the plasma outruns the influx of ions .",
    "the collection of electrons at the wall ( boundary of the object ) gives rise to a repulsive coulomb potential which reduces the electron influx until the wall charge reaches a quasi - stationary value . as a consequence of the electron accumulation at the wall an electron depleted region , the plasma sheath ,",
    "is formed adjacent to the wall .",
    "most of the voltage driving the discharge drops across the sheath . wall charges may however not only affect the spatial structure of the plasma but also surface - supported elementary process such as electron - ion recombination and secondary electron emission , which are particularly important in dusty plasmas,@xcite dielectric barrier discharges,@xcite and solid - state based micro - discharges.@xcite a macroscopic description of the plasma - induced wall charge , sufficient for the modeling of the plasma sheath ,  @xcite is clearly insufficient for quantifying the effect wall charges might have on these processes .",
    "a microscopic description of the plasma - induced wall charge and the potential across the plasma - wall interface it leads to is required .",
    "traditionally , plasma walls are treated as perfect absorbers.@xcite irrespective of the microscopic interaction , all electrons and ions impinging on the wall are assumed to recombine instantly . from this model",
    "only the wall potential just outside the wall can be obtained .",
    "this is the potential that balances the electron and ion influx at the wall .",
    "a first , qualitative step going beyond this model was taken by emeleus and coulter,@xcite who envisaged the wall charge as a two - dimensional surface plasma coupled to the bulk plasma via electron - ion wall recombination .",
    "no attempt was however made to put this appealing idea onto a formal basis .",
    "later the notion of a two - dimensional surface charge was developed further by behnke and coworkers@xcite utilizing phenomenological rate equations for the electron and ion surface densities . in these equations , the microphysics at the wall",
    "is encapsulated in surface parameters , such as , electron and ion sticking coefficients , electron and ion desorption times , and an electron - ion wall recombination coefficient . in principle",
    "these parameters can be calculated .",
    "assuming , for instance , plasma electrons to ad- and desorb in the long - range image potential of the wall we calculated in our previous work electron sticking coefficients and electron desorption times for uncharged metallic  @xcite and dielectric surfaces .",
    "@xcite we also made a first attempt to estimate these two quantities for charged dielectric plasma walls  @xcite and proposed a physisorption - inspired microscopic charging model for dust particles in a gas discharge .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we shift gears and focus on the potential and charge distribution across the plasma - wall interface after the quasi - stationary wall charge ( electron adsorbate in the notation of our previous work  @xcite ) has been established . in other words , we extend the modeling of the plasma sheath  @xcite to the region inside the solid and calculate the plasma - induced modifications of the potential and charge distribution of the surface . although knowing the potential and charge distribution across the interface may not be of particular importance for present day technological plasmas , it is of fundamental interest from an interface physics point of view .",
    "in addition , considering the plasma wall as an integral part of the plasma sheath may become critical when the miniaturization of solid - state based plasma devices  @xcite continues .    in the model outlined below we",
    "specifically consider a dielectric wall and treat the plasma - induced quasi - stationary wall charge , that is , the surplus charge on top of the charge distribution of the bare , free - standing surface , as an electron surface layer of a certain extent , which is trapped by and in thermal equilibrium with the wall . in order to determine the chemical potential , width , and spatial position ( relative to the crystallographic interface ) of the electron surface layer , which depend on surface as well as plasma parameters , we employ a one - dimensional model for a graded interface between a collisionless plasma sheath and a dielectric surface which is assumed to be a perfect absorber , that is , the wall potential balances at a certain distance from the crystallographic interface the electron and the ion influx from the plasma .",
    "the model of a graded interface encompasses two important ingredients : the surface dipole of the bare surface responsible for the offset of the conduction band minimum to the potential just outside the dielectric and the long - range image potential .",
    "the former accounts for the charge re - distribution of the free - standing , uncharged surface arising from the truncation of the crystal and the latter supports polarization - induced external surface states ( image states ) , first predicted for liquid helium  @xcite and later studied for metallic and dielectric surface with negative electron affinity  @xcite , which may trap the electron surface layer in front of the crystallographic interface .",
    "originally proposed by stern for the interface between two dielectrics,@xcite and later on used by others for semiconductor heterojunctions  @xcite and electron trapping in nanopores,@xcite the graded interface model also guarantees continuity of the electrostatic potential across the plasma - wall interface .",
    "the model thus allows us to study the spatial distribution of the plasma - induced wall charge across the interface . to insert the surplus charge into the interface we follow tkharev and danilyuk  @xcite and minimize , in the spirit of density functional theory ,  @xcite the grand canonical potential of wall - thermalized excess electrons",
    "we also investigate how the electron surface layer merges with the neutral bulk of the dielectric which we describe with the model of an intrinsic semiconductor .",
    "various improvements of the model are conceivable but the increased mathematical complexity would mask the general ideas we would like to convey .",
    "for instance , the model of a collisionless sheath could be replaced by more realistic models .",
    "@xcite going beyond the perfect absorber model , on the other hand , is an unsolved problem .",
    "it would require the inclusion of electron desorption , electron sticking , and electron - ion recombination , with the respective coefficients to be self - consistently calculated for the quasi - stationary electron adsorbate at the wall .",
    "replacing the graded interface by an ab - initio theory for the surface , for instance , along the lines given in refs .",
    "@xcite , possibly taking ad - layers of the host gas atoms or molecules as well as impurities and imperfections into account , is desirable but at the present stage of the investigation impractical .",
    "it would require an expensive atomistic characterization of the plasma - wall interface , either experimentally via various surface diagnostics or theoretically via ab - initio simulations .",
    "as long as the atomistic details affect however only the off - sets of the dielectric constant , the electron affinity , and the effective mass , the graded interface model already incorporates these details by a suitable parameterization .",
    "what is not well described is the non - universal region a few atomic units below and above the crystallographic interface .",
    "in particular , intrinsic surface states ( shockley and tamm states  @xcite ) and additional surface states which may arise from the short - range surface potential due to impurities , imperfections , and ad - layers are not included .",
    "if unoccupied these states could trap the electron surface layer in the vicinity of the interface even for surfaces with positive electron affinity where image states are absent and can not trap the surplus charge in front of the surface .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "as depicted in fig .  [ figure1 ] , we consider an ideal , planar interface at @xmath2 with the dielectric occupying the half - space @xmath3 and the discharge occupying the half - space @xmath4 .",
    "chemical contamination and structural damage due to the burning gas discharge are discarded . at the moment we focus on the physical principles controlling the electronic properties of the plasma - wall interface . in the model",
    "we propose the plasma - induced wall charge to be treated as an electron surface layer ( esl ) which is an interface specific electron distribution on top of the charge re - distribution due to the truncation of the solid .",
    "the esl is assumed to be thermalized with the solid and to stretch from the plasma sheath over the crystallographic interface to the bulk of the dielectric .",
    "the boundary between the esl and the plasma sheath is located in front of the surface at @xmath5 .",
    "it is the position where the attractive force due to the surface potential @xmath6 and the repulsive force due to the sheath potential @xmath7 balance each other .",

    "the esl is bounded because of the shallow potential well formed by the restoring force from the positive charge in the plasma sheath .    in this section",
    "we will outline the essential building blocks of the esl model .",
    "putting together concepts from plasma as well as surface physics a detailed , self - contained account seems to be helpful .      in the traditional view , electrons missing in the positive space charge region in front of the plasma wall accumulate on the wall and give rise to a wall potential . for the construction of our one - dimensional interface model",
    "we need the total number per unit area of missing sheath electrons ( that is , the total surface density of missing sheath electrons ) as a function of the wall potential because it is this number of electrons which can be distributed across the esl .",
    "hence , we require a model for the plasma sheath .    for simplicity",

    "we now turn to the interface region in which the missing sheath electrons will be inserted .",
    "this region is absent in the traditional modeling of plasma walls . in our model",
    "it is an extended region surrounding an ideal dielectric surface . in comparison to the electrons responsible for the chemical binding within the dielectric",
    "the additional electrons coming from the plasma are only a few .",
    "the electronic structure of the surface , in particular , the charge re - distribution due to truncation of the solid and the offset of the energy bands in the bulk with respect to the potential outside the dielectric will not be changed significantly by the presence of the surplus electrons comprising the wall charge .    in order to quantify the above statement",
    "let us first consider the electrostatic potential and the electronic structure of a free - standing , uncharged dielectric surface . according to tung,@xcite it has to minimize the thermodynamical potential and satisfy poisson s equation implying that the potential is continuous across the surface .",
    "strictly speaking , the continuity of the potential only applies to the microscopic crystal potential which has to merge continuously with the surface potential outside the crystal .",
    "the averaged long - range potential , in contrast , can be discontinuous at the interface .",
    "it is this offset which is encoded in the surface dipole .",

    "whether the surplus charge arising from the plasma affects the surface dipole it is useful to consider first the typical strength of the surface dipole of a free - standing , uncharged dielectric surface .",
    "it results from a charge double - layer in immediate proximity to the surface . depending on the material it can have various origins . for an ionic crystal , for example",
    ", it is the lattice relaxation at the surface which makes anions or cations to protrude and the other species to retract ( e.g. protruding oxygen and retracted cations for magnesium oxide@xcite ) , while for semiconductors it is the regrouping of covalent bonds which leads to charge re - distribution at the surface . even in the absence of these effects",
    "the minimization of the thermodynamic potential of the surface s electrons leads already to an electron density leaking out into the vacuum .",
    "this is particularly important for metals . as a result",
    "a charge double - layer is formed over a length on the order of a lattice constant .",
    "the dipole layer is usually characterized by a dipole strength @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the limit of the long range potential just inside the crystal at the surface position @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the limit of the potential at that position just outside the surface .",
    "usually these two potentials , which characterize the discontinuity of the long - range potential at the surface , are termed the potential just inside and the potential just outside , respectively.@xcite here , just outside denotes a distance small compared to variations of the long - range potential due to external fields or space charges but large compared with the width of the charge double - layer .",
    "note also that in the definition of the potential just outside the image potential is assumed to have already decreased to zero .",
    "@xcite this point will be important later .",
    "the strength of the dipole layer is a microscopic property of the surface which is relatively insensitive against the additional charges from the plasma .",
    "the reason for this lies in the small number of additional electrons from the plasma compared to the number of displaced electrons involved in the formation of the dipole layer . to prove this statement we give a simple estimate .",
    "typical surface dipoles @xmath55 are on the order of electron volts . for a double - layer of one @xmath56 to each side of the crystallographic interface a potential difference of one volt",
    "requires a surface charge density of @xmath57 . the surface charge density at the wall of a helium discharge with plasma density @xmath58 and electron temperature @xmath59 amounts , however , only to @xmath60 .",
    "for typical plasma densities , the number of additional electrons is thus far too small to lead to a change of the surface dipole . even for semiconductor - based microdischarges  @xcite , which can have much higher plasma densities",
    ", we expect the surface dipole of the plasma wall not to be modified by the plasma .    in view of the just given estimate",
    ", we have to revise an assumption in our previous work,@xcite where we assumed the surface charge accumulating on the wall would increase the dipole energy @xmath55 by @xmath61 , leading to the image states being pushed from the band gap into the energy region of the conduction band .",
    "the numbers given in the previous paragraph indicate , however , that the band line - up of the conduction band and the potential just outside the solid , will not be affected much by the wall charge . hence ,",
    "if a negative electron affinity supports image states in front of the uncharged surface , these states remain in the band gap for the charged surface .",
    "electron trapping as investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite is thus even possible for charged plasma walls .    instead of the dipole strength",
    "@xmath55 which can not be measured directly , it is more convenient to characterize the dipole layer by the electron affinity @xmath62 which is a measurable quantity for a dielectric surface .",
    "@xcite the electron affinity is the energy released when an electron is moved from just outside the surface to the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "it accounts for charge re - distribution in the vicinity of the surface due to the truncation of the crystal . while many surfaces have positive electron affinity such as al@xmath0o@xmath1 or sio@xmath0 , there are also materials with negative electron affinity , for instance , diamond  @xcite , boron nitride@xcite , or the alkaline earth oxides .",
    "@xcite the electron affinity depends also on ad - atoms . in some cases this",
    "is even used to control the electron affinity of a surface .",
    "terminating , for instance , a surface with weakly electronegative elements such as hydrogen induces a negative electron affinity ,  @xcite while termination with strongly electronegative elements can lead to a positive electron affinity .",
    "@xcite    from eq .",
    "( [ energyreference ] ) it is clear that @xmath62 equals @xmath55 plus a bulk contribution , @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the minimum of the conduction band .",
    "we can thus use @xmath62 to characterize the potential offset at the surface .",
    "there is however a caveat .",
    "the long - range potential inside the solid is only specified up to a constant.@xcite typical choices are the cell - averaged potential or the inter - sphere potential of the muffin - tin approximation . for our purpose it will be however more convenient to take the conduction band minimum as the long - range potential inside the solid .",
    "this choice is motivated as follows .",
    "we are considering a dielectric with a large energy gap .",
    "the valence band is thus fully occupied and the conduction band is essentially empty .",
    "hence , only the conduction band can be populated by additional electrons coming from the plasma and referencing the electrostatic potential inside the solid to the conduction band minimum allows us to relate the total surplus electron density in the interface region to the potential in the interface region in analogy to what we have done for the plasma sheath in the previous subsection .    adopting the above discussion to the one - dimensional model shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] and assuming a quadratic dispersion for the conduction band , the energy of an electron in the conduction band is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the total surface potential to be determined in the next subsection and the offset of the electrostatic potential at the surface , @xmath67 encompasses the surface dipole as well as the unspecified bulk contribution .      the surface potential of the bare , uncharged surface comprises at least the surface dipole and a long - range contribution , the image potential , resulting from the mismatch of the dielectric constants at the surface .",
    "far away from the surface the image potential is given by@xcite @xmath68 but this expression can not be employed for our purpose because the singularity at @xmath2 prohibits a smooth electron distribution across the interface .",
    "in reality the image potential has to continuously merge with the crystal potential .",
    "equation  ( [ imageclassical ] ) is thus also unphysical .    to obtain a realistic image potential without performing an atomistically accurate calculation",
    "we employ the model of a graded interface .",
    "it also has the virtue to be parameterizable with experimentally measured values for the electron affinity , the dielectric mismatch , and the mismatch between effective electron masses .",
    "the model incorporates therefore important properties of a surface , most importantly , it accounts for the charge re - distribution due to the truncation of the solid .",
    "initially proposed by stern  @xcite to remove the unphysical singularity of the image potential at the interface of two dielectrics , the graded interface model assumes the dielectric constant @xmath69 to vary over a distance on the order of a lattice constant .",
    "later the model was extended to variations of other physical quantities and applied to semiconductor heterostructures and nanopores .",
    "@xcite clearly , because of the interpolation the model can not account for effects associated with intrinsic surface states ( shockley and tamm states  @xcite ) and additional surface states which may arise from the short - range surface potential .",
    "nevertheless , the graded interface model is a reasonable description of a surface .    in the spirit of a graded interface , we assume the dielectric constant @xmath69 , the electron mass @xmath70 , and the potential offset at the surface to vary smoothly according to the grading function @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the half width of the graded interface and @xmath73 stands for the quantity that varies across the interface .",
    "we use the value @xmath74 which is an estimate used in previous applications of the graded interface.@xcite while the grading parameter @xmath72 is not based on definite experimental or theoretical results it is motivated by the assumption that the bonding and the electron density at the surface change over one to two lattice constants implying a transition layer for the effective potential and the dielectric constant that is somewhat larger .",
    "hence , across the interface the electron mass , the dielectric constant and the offset potential are given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively , with @xmath77 the effective mass of the conduction band .",

    "the surplus electrons are strongly bound in the image potential . while a variation of @xmath196 or @xmath17 changes the total number of surplus electrons per unit area in the same way as for a surface with positive electron affinity , the distribution of the surplus electrons within the esl",

    "the potential develops a coulomb barrier and reaches the wall potential @xmath198 at @xmath8 , the distance where the sheath merges with the surface layer ( vertical dotted line ) .",
    "the wall potential is the potential just outside to which the energies of the bulk states are referenced .",
    "closer to the surface the potential follows the attractive image potential while at the surface the repulsive potential due to the negative electron affinity prevents the electron from entering the dielectric ( only scarcely seen on the scale of the figure ) .    in fig .",

    "the excess electrons constituting the wall charge penetrate deep into the dielectric and occupy therefore the scr of the esl .",
    "compared to the variation of the electric potential in the sheath the band bending in the dielectric induced by the wall charge is rather small as indicated by the variation of @xmath16 inside the dielectric .",
    "this is because @xmath69 is large and the width of the scr is narrow on the scale of the sheath . only on the scale of the isr ( a vertical line at @xmath2 ) the scr of the esl is wide .",
    "we have studied the potential and the charge distribution across the interface of a plasma and a dielectric wall treating the plasma - induced wall charge as a quasi - stationary electron gas trapped by and in thermal equilibrium with the dielectric .",
    "our approach is based on a model for a graded surface including the offset between the potential just outside the dielectric and the conduction band minimum arising from the re - distribution of charge due to the truncation of the solid as well as the image potential due to the dielectric mismatch at the boundary .",
    "the missing electrons from the sheath populate the interface potential and thereby form an electron surface layer ( esl ) which minimizes the grand canonical potential of wall - thermalized excess electrons and satisfies poisson s equation .    within this model the boundary between the plasma sheath and the esl is given by the distance from the crystallographic interface where the potential for the excess electrons turns from the repulsive sheath potential into the attractive surface potential .",
    "this distance is typically on the order of a micron .",
    "it gives the position of an effective wall for plasma electrons and ions and thus the portion of the esl which lays in front of the surface .",
    "most of the surplus electrons trapped in the esl , that is , the plasma - induced wall charge , will be , however , much closer to the surface or even inside the dielectric depending on the electron affinity .",
    "we presented numerical results for the potential and the distribution of the plasma - supplied surplus electrons at the interface between a helium discharge and the surfaces of mgo , al@xmath0o@xmath1 , and sio@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the electron distribution within the esl strongly depends on the electron affinity . for negative electron affinity ,",
    "the conduction band minimum is above the potential just outside the dielectric .",
    "hence , it is energetically unfavorable for electrons to penetrate into the bulk and the surface electrons are bound in the image potential in front of the surface . in this case , their spatial profile changes little over a variation of the surface temperature or the plasma parameters . for positive electron affinity",
    "the conduction band minimum is below the potential just outside the dielectric and the surface - bound electrons accumulate inside the wall .",
    "the space charge in the bulk broadens if the surface temperature is increased and becomes more peaked if the total surface density of the electrons missing in the sheath is raised through either an increase in the plasma density or the electron temperature . separating the esl into an interface specific and a space charge region and modeling the bulk of the dielectric as an intrinsic semiconductor we also investigated how the esl merges with the bulk of the dielectric .",
    "this is particularly important for dielectrics with small energy gaps and positive electron affinities where excess electrons coming from the sheath accumulate not in the image potential in front of the surface but deep inside the wall . in this case",
    "the wall charge may also induce a significant band bending .    whereas the crude esl model we proposed neglects the space charge deep inside the bulk of the wall and is thus only applicable to large band gap dielectrics with negative electron affinity where basically the whole plasma - induced wall charge is trapped in the image potential in front of the surface , the refined esl model keeping the interface specific as well as the space charge region of the esl provides a quantitative description of the whole spatial structure of the extended charge double - layer which forms at a dielectric plasma wall as a result of the electrons in the esl and the positive space charge in the plasma sheath .",
    "the esl can be regarded as that part of the plasma sheath which is inside the plasma wall .",
    "it is thus the ultimate boundary of a bounded gas discharge and constitutes , depending on the electron affinity either a quasi two - dimensional electron plasma in front of the wall or an electron(-hole ) plasma inside the wall ."
