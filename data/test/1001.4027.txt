    "the description and understanding of amorphous structures is very challenging because the lack of any translational symmetry makes it hard to encode the structural information into a compact form .",
    "the absence of periodicity does not exclude however repetitiveness .",
    "indeed , in amorphous systems several local configurations , or ` motifs ' , are repeated often .",
    "however , one must consider that these ` repetitions ' typically concern similar but non identical units with small variations between one and the other .",
    "furthermore , the choice of the parameters that identify the local motifs is somehow arbitrary and , as a consequence , depending on the detail of the description , one can gather information about the local structure at different levels .",
    "the identification of these motifs and the study of their variations are the fundamental first step toward the understanding of the structure of granular materials and of other disordered systems such as amorphous phases . in these disordered systems , the structure is necessarily defined in statistical terms and it can be characterized by the probability of occurrence of a given motif .",
    "statistical mechanics is the theoretical instrument to calculate such probability .    in this paper",
    "we focus on equal - sized bead packings both from experiments and simulations . for these systems",
    "we identify the local structural motifs with the voronoi cells which are defined as the portion of space closest to a given bead center than to any other in the packing .",
    "in particular , we choose to consider the volume @xmath0 of such cells as the only parameter identifying the local structural organization .",
    "the overall packing fraction @xmath1 of the sample is directly related to the average voronoi volume @xmath2 by @xmath3 with @xmath4 the volume of a bead with diameter @xmath5 .",
    "the voronoi cell defines a region of pertinence around each bead .",
    "the fluctuations of the voronoi volumes are therefore a measure of the local variations in the packing fraction .",
    "indeed , the local fraction of occupied volume is @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we discuss the distribution of such volumes showing that it is very well reproduced by a kgamma distribution @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this functional form is retrieved in a wide set of very different systems from idealized hard sphere packings to glass beads in water .",
    "the experimental data sets of bead configurations that we analyze in this paper are from the database on disordered packings @xcite which contains structural data from experimental sphere packings obtained by x - ray computed tomography .",
    "specifically our study concerns 6 samples ( a - f ) composed of acrylic beads prepared in air within a cylindrical container with an inner diameter of @xmath7 and filled to a height of @xmath8 @xcite . samples",
    "a and c contain @xmath9 beads with diameter @xmath10 and polydispersity within @xmath11 .",
    "samples b , d - f contain @xmath12 beads with diameter @xmath13 and polydispersity within @xmath11 .",
    "the two samples at lower packing fraction ( a , b ) were obtained by placing a stick in the middle of the container before pouring the beads and then slowly removing the stick @xcite .",
    "sample c was prepared by gently and slowly pouring the spheres into the container .",
    "sample d was obtained by a faster pouring . in sample",
    "e , a higher packing fraction was achieved by gently tapping the container walls . the densest sample ( f )",
    "was obtained by a combined action of gentle tapping and compression from above ( with the upper surface left unconfined at the end of the preparation ) . to reduce boundary effects , the inside of the cylinder was roughened by randomly gluing spheres to the internal surface .",
    "the packing fraction of each of the samples is estimated at : a , @xmath14 ; b , @xmath15 ; c , @xmath16 ; d , @xmath17 ; e , @xmath18 ; and f , @xmath19 .      twelve other samples ( fb12 - 24 and fb27 ) containing about 150,000 glass beads with diameters @xmath20 are also analysed .",
    "the packings were prepared in water by means of a fluidised bed technique @xcite within a vertical polycarbonate tube with an inner diameter of 12.8 @xmath21 and a length of 230 @xmath21 .",
    "packing fractions between 0.56 and 0.60 were obtained by using different flow rates with higher rates associated with lower packing fractions .",
    "after each flow pulse , the particles sediment forming a mechanically stable packing .",
    "x - ray computed tomography ( xct ) is used to calculate the coordinates of the bead centers .",
    "this is done by applying a convolution method to the three - dimensional xct density map efficiently implemented by use of ( parallel ) fast fourier transform .",
    "furthermore a watershed method is also used to identify distinct grains . with this technique",
    "the estimation of the position of the centre of mass of each grain can be achieved with a precision better than 0.1% of the sphere diameter .",
    "this is well below the grain polydispersity that is estimated around 1 to 3  % depending on the sample .",
    "a set of simulated packings are produced by using a modified lubachevsky - stillinger ( ls ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the simulation is an event - driven newtonian dynamics in which the spheres are considered perfectly elastic without any rotational degree of freedom and with no friction .",
    "the simulation is performed in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions , without gravity . during the simulation , the radii of the spheres",
    "are gradually increased from a very loose initial state to more densely packed configurations . in these simulations",
    "the principal control parameter is the growth rate for the sphere radii .",
    "small values of growth rates will result in crystallisation . to avoid crystallization",
    "the growth rate should be rather large , forcing the packing into `` jammed '' non - crystalline structures where the spheres can not be further expanded at finite pressure @xcite .",
    "simulations were performed by using the code at : http://cherrypit.princeton.edu/packing/c++/ on @xmath22 spheres with initial temperature 0.1 , with initial packing fraction @xmath23 and with a number of event per cycle equal to 20 .",
    "the spheres were expanded with different growth rates between 2e-5 to 0.5 , until a maximal reduced pressure of @xmath24 was reached @xcite .",
    "we use discrete element method simulation ( dem ) which integrates the newton equation of motion with both translational and rotational degrees of freedoms for elasto - frictional spheres under gravity @xcite .",
    "the spheres interact only when overlapping , with a normal repulsive force @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the overlap between grains of diameters @xmath5 with centres at @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the stiffness parameter ( @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the young s modulus and @xmath32 the poisson ratio ) @xcite .",
    "tangential force under oblique loading is also considered as , with @xmath33 the displacement in the tangential direction that has taken place since the time @xmath34 when the two spheres first got in contact , where @xmath35 is the relative shear velocity and @xmath36 is the kinematic friction coefficient between the spheres and @xmath37 the tangential stiffness parameter typically assumed @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "normal visco - elastic dissipation @xmath39 ( with @xmath40 the normal velocity ) and a viscous friction force @xmath41 @xcite are also included .",
    "here we report data for 64 simulations prepared by pouring , into a cylinder with a rough boundary , spherical beads with diameters @xmath42 mm .",
    "the cylinder had section @xmath43 and it was filled with @xmath44 beads to an height of @xmath45 resulting in an initial packing fraction around @xmath46 .",
    "the beads were let sediment under gravity reaching a final mechanically stable state with packing fraction in a range between @xmath47 to @xmath48 depending mainly on the value of the friction coefficient ( larger frictions smaller packing fractions ) , and also on the gravity and on the stokes constant .",
    "the time step has been set at 8.0e-6 sec , the grain mass is 0.003 kg and @xmath491.9e7 , @xmath505.6e6 .",
    "the simulations were performed at various @xmath51 from 1e-3 to 1e2 , various values of gravity from @xmath52 to @xmath53 and several friction coefficients from 1e-4 to 1e4 .",
    "[ s.4 ]    granular structures are disordered .",
    "this means that , differently form crystals , a unique `` ideal '' structure where all the grains positions are uniquely assigned does not exist .",
    "there are instead a very large number of structures that have equivalent global properties ( packing fraction , mechanical properties , etc . ) but differ in the way the grains are locally arranged . for these disordered packings",
    "we aim to find a relation between global functional properties and local structural properties and identify the probability of occurrence of specific local structural features for given global properties .",
    "statistical mechanics is the theoretical framework that allows us to perform this kind of computation .",
    "a statistical mechanics approach for granular systems was firstly proposed by edwards in 1989 @xcite .",
    "the key idea is that these non - thermal systems can be described by using a formalism very similar to the one developed for molecular gasses by substituting the constraint on the energy with a constraint on the volume occupied by the system .",
    "although this is one of the few examples of extension of classical statistical mechanics concepts to a - thermal systems , the edwards approach is rather straightforward .",
    "any reader with some familiarity with thermal physics and classical statistical mechanics will recognize that the forthcoming statistical description of granular systems is formally identical to the one for molecular gasses with ` @xmath54 ' substituted with ` @xmath0 ' .",
    "however , conceptually , the approach is not trivial because in granular systems we lack mechanisms equivalent to temperature and molecular chaos that allow thermal systems to explore homogeneously the phase space . in granular systems energy",
    "is dissipated in inelastic collision and the system soon reaches a static state with immobile grains at mechanical equilibrium .",
    "such state can only be changed by perturbing the system , injecting energy , for instance through vibrations or fluid flow @xcite .",
    "for a given preparation protocol one aims to identify the probability of occurrence of some specific structural features and their related functional properties . in order to associate a probability to a given structure",
    ", one should ( virtually ) explore the whole set of possible structures which are attainable through a given preparation protocol and compute the frequency of occurrence of that specific structure within the ensemble of all attainable realizations . within equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics approach this computation is typically performed by assigning an entropy and maximizing it ; finding in this way the configurations with maximum likelihood .",
    "it is beyond the propose and the possibility of this paper to fully expose the subdue issues around this kind of approach that have been debated in the literature for the last twenty years since 1989 @xcite .",
    "here we are merely comparing the theoretical prediction from a statistical mechanics approach ( namely eq.[e.pv1d ] ) with data from experiments and computer simulations . to have a better insight of our approach to this problem and for a formal deductive derivation of eq.[e.pv1d ] , the interest reader can refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "let us hereafter only briefly sketch the main ideas and the main passages of this approach .    in analogy with the edwards original approach here we consider the ensemble of mechanically stable configurations that can be achieved by means of a given preparation protocol resulting in a given average packing fraction over a large number of trials @xcite .",
    "here we look at the statistics of the local configurations of each voronoi cell and we maximize entropy to calculate the probability @xmath55 for a cell with volume @xmath0 in a sample with packing fraction @xmath1 where the average voronoi volume is @xmath56 . a classical equilibrium statistical mechanics theory `",
    "a la edwards ' gives : @xmath57 with @xmath58 a lagrange multiplier which is determined by the constraint on the average volume : @xmath59 here the challenge is to compute @xmath60 which is the ` density of states ' counting the number of microscopic configurations associated with a voronoi volume @xmath0 .",
    "let us note that eq.[e.me ] is the analogous for these non - thermal systems to the boltzmann distribution for molecular gasses where in this case the particle energy is substituted with the voronoi cell volume .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "[ s.7 ]    we have tested the validity and resilience of the kgamma behavior over a set of several hundreds numerical simulations and over 18 different experiments .",
    "the simulations consisted of both lubachevsky - stillinger newtonian dynamics of frictionless hard spheres and dem simulations of elasto - frictional spheres .",
    "the experiments include dry and fluidized bead samples .",
    "figure [ f.lsvor ] shows the resulting distribution of the vorono volumes .",
    "one can see that such distributions span a very broad interval of volumes with @xmath0 between @xmath61 and @xmath62 with large differences between different samples shown both in the average values and in the distribution spreading .",
    "we observe that all distributions show some degree of asymmetry around the maximum with larger probabilities for large volume fluctuations . from eq .",
    "[ e.pv1d ] , one can see that _ kgamma _ distributions characterized by similar values of @xmath63 must result into similar behaviors when plotted as function of @xmath64 .",
    "figure [ f.lsvorcoll ] shows the plot of all the distributions as a function of such shifted - rescaled variable .",
    "we note that all distributions collapse into a very similar functional form which is very well described by the kgamma function @xmath65 with @xmath63 ranging in a narrow interval .",
    "the goodness of the description of these distributions by means of the kgamma function in eq.[e.pv1d ] can be judged from fig.[f.lsvorcollexp ] which shows the agreement between the prediction from the kgamma function @xmath55 and the measured data from experiments .",
    "similar agreements are found across all samples from both experiments and simulations .",
    "it should be stressed that in this plot there are no adjustable parameters or fitting constants .",
    "indeed , the only two parameters in eq.[e.pv1d ] are @xmath2 and @xmath63 which are uniquely determined respectively from the sample packing fraction ( @xmath56 ) and from the measured standard deviation of the vorornoi volumes ( @xmath66 , eq.[e.k ] ) .",
    "the impressive fact of such an agreement is that these systems are very different ( ideal newtonian spheres , elasto - frictional spheres under gravity , real experimental acrylic beads in air and glass beads in water ) and they are prepared in very different ways ( pouring , tapping , fluid flows , molecular dynamics , shearing ) .",
    "the collapse of all these distributions around a unique functional form suggests that the main driving mechanism which determines these fluctuations is an exchange of volume among voronoi cells that possesses only a small number of degrees of freedom . accordingly with our hypothesis ,",
    "such a number is given by the parameter @xmath63 .",
    "in fig.[f.krho ] we report the measured values of @xmath63 as function of the sample packing fraction calculated from the relation @xmath67 ( eq.[e.k ] ) . we observe a rather narrow and homogeneous range of values laying between 11 and 15 for all samples .",
    "a sharp drop in @xmath63 is observed above @xmath68 where in the lubachevsky - stillinger simulations a crystalline phase starts to nucleate and grow .",
    "let us note that in this phase a peak at larger packing fractions appears in the volume distributions ( not reported in figs.[f.lsvor ] and [ f.lsvorcoll ] to avoid confusion . ) .",
    "the good predictive potential of kgamma distributions for volume fluctuations in granular assemblies can also be inferred from the simple measure of the standard deviation .",
    "indeed , standard deviations can be easily measured and require smaller statistical sets with respect to the whole distribution .",
    "figure  [ f.sig ] reports the trend of the measured standard deviation versus the packing fraction for all the samples .",
    "it is clearly evident from the figure that they all follow a common decreasing trend before the crystallization onset above @xmath68 .",
    "the line in the figure is the the prediction from eq.[e.variance ] : @xmath69 ) , for @xmath70 .",
    "in this paper we have shown that kgamma distributions describe very well the observed voronoi volume distributions in a wide variety of systems from simulated hard spheres to real experimental packings .",
    "the agreement between the predicted distribution and the measures is remarkable also considering that there are no adjustable parameters or fitting constants .",
    "we have briefly explained as a statistical mechanics approach can be used to retrieve such a distribution from a very simple hypothesis that the voronoi cells in the systems have @xmath63 degrees of freedom associated to their volumes . despite the very good agreement with the empirical data that has been shown in this paper",
    ", this hypothesis is certainly quite strong and unrealistic .",
    "indeed , it might be true that in average there are @xmath63 degrees of freedom per voronoi cell but it is unlikely that _ each _ vorornoi cell has _ exactly _",
    "@xmath63 degrees of freedom",
    ". a relaxation of this hypothesis on a more realistic ground would produce different outcomes predicting for instance other kinds of gamma distributions . however , the beauty and the strength of the present approach is that we have only one parameter that is fully determined by the measured standard deviation . in our view , the exceptional agreement of all the experimental and numerical data with the prediction from kgamma distribution does not justify , at the present , the introduction of a more complicated theoretical framework with the consequent incorporation of extra adjustable parameters .",
