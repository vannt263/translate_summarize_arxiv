    "experimental evidence for rapid thermalization of the dense matter created in heavy ion collisions at rhic @xcite provided strong motivation for a new look at the non - perturbative structure of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the rapid thermalization of the qgp has been related to the smallness of the shear viscosity in the plasma phase @xcite , which may come close to the theoretical lower bound established for the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density @xcite .",
    "this gave rise to the interpretation of the quark gluon plasma above but close to the transition temperature as a strongly interacting medium that has properties of an almost perfect liquid .",
    "these experimental findings also renewed the interest in determining transport properties of gauge theories through the calculation of correlation functions of the energy - momentum tensor on the lattice .",
    "this is by far not a straightforward calculation and requires a careful analysis of the low frequency structure of the spectral representation of these correlation functions @xcite .",
    "nonetheless progress has been made through high statistics calculations in su(3 ) gauge theories @xcite .",
    "recently it has been argued that close to the transition from low temperature hadronic matter to the plasma phase of qcd bulk viscosity might play a much more important role than shear viscosity @xcite ; bulk viscosity has been related to a temperature derivative of the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the latter does diverge at a second order critical point @xcite and thus would force bulk viscosity to diverge too .",
    "this argument is based on a sum rule derived for correlation functions of the energy - momentum tensor in minkowski space @xcite . however , as noted recently @xcite , in euclidean space the correlation function of the trace of the energy - momentum tensor picks up an additional constant contribution corresponding to an exact @xmath0-function at zero frequency in the spectral representation of this correlator .",
    "this contribution , in fact , cancels the leading singular behavior of the correlation function and thus makes the relation between transport coefficients and properties of bulk thermodynamic observables more subtle .    in the following",
    "we will provide evidence for the presence of a contribution to the correlation function of the trace of energy - momentum tensor that is constant in euclidean time but temperature dependent .",
    "we show that the temperature dependence of this contribution scales like the specific heat and thus dominates the singular behavior of this correlation function in the vicinity of @xmath1 .",
    "these findings also explain the inconsistency observed in the parametric dependence of bulk viscosity derived in high temperature perturbation theory and through the sum rule analysis @xcite .",
    "the singular behavior of bulk viscosity in the vicinity of a critical point has long been known in statistical physics @xcite . in particular , the divergence of bulk viscosity at the critical point of the liquid gas transition has been analyzed extensively @xcite . in this case",
    "the divergence of bulk viscosity ( @xmath2 ) has been related to the critical behavior of the 3-dimensional ising model @xcite , which is in the universality class for the critical point of the liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "it has been argued that the divergence of @xmath2 is strong and , in fact , almost quadratic in the inverse reduced temperature , @xmath3 .",
    "the singular behavior , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 denoting static critical exponents of the 3-d ising model and @xmath6 being a dynamical exponent characterizing the equilibration of density fluctuations , goes along with a strong divergence of the relaxation time for density fluctuations , @xmath7 .",
    "their ratio , @xmath8 , however , is proportional to the inverse of the specific heat and thus vanishes slowly at the critical point .",
    "while numerous numerical studies have confirmed that the critical behavior of bulk thermodynamics in @xmath9-dimensional gauge theories is indeed controlled by @xmath10-dimensional universality classes corresponding to the global symmetry of the relevant order parameter , little is known about the relation between dynamic properties and the related critical exponents @xcite .",
    "the su(2 ) gauge theory with its second order deconfinement phase transition seems to be an ideal model to explore critical behavior of dynamical properties , e.g. transport coefficients .",
    "the su(2 ) gauge theory at finite temperature incorporates all the basic features one expects to be relevant for deconfinement in qcd .",
    "moreover , it has a second order phase transition which belongs to the universality class of the 3-dimensional ising model .",
    "it thus will allow to analyze in how far dynamic universal properties known for the ising universality class are relevant for transport properties in a quantum field theory .",
    "it also may give insight into transport properties in the vicinity of the chiral critical point in qcd that may exist at non - zero baryon number density and also would belong to the ising universality class @xcite . in the vicinity of the su(2 ) deconfinement phase transition a lot of information exists about the critical behavior of bulk thermodynamics that can be related to the critical behavior of correlation functions of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this will help to gain experience with lattice calculations of the bulk viscosity in pure gauge theories .    in this paper",
    "we will establish relations between the critical behavior of bulk thermodynamic observables in the vicinity of the su(2 ) deconfinement transition and properties of correlation functions of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "in particular , we will analyze the euclidean correlation functions of the trace of the energy - momentum tensor and compare it to critical behavior of the specific heat .",
    "we present evidence that the strength of the divergence of this correlation function at @xmath1 is independent of euclidean time and is controlled by the universal structure of the divergence of the specific heat at a critical point belonging to the 3-dimensional ising universality class . in the next section we review the calculation of bulk thermodynamic observables in su(2 ) gauge theory @xcite and",
    "present some new results on the diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor , _",
    "i.e. _ energy density and pressure , in the vicinity of the deconfinement transition temperature . in section",
    "iii we introduce local operators for energy density and pressure and discuss basic properties of their finite temperature euclidean time correlation functions at vanishing momentum .",
    "section iv is devoted to a discussion of critical behavior extracted from correlation functions of the trace anomaly and presents a calculation of the pressure - pressure correlator .",
    "we analyze consequences for the determination of bulk viscosity from these correlation functions in section v. finally , we conclude in section vi .",
    "as preparation for the analysis of correlation functions of diagonal elements of the energy - momentum tensor we want to discuss here the calculation of the relevant bulk thermodynamic observables , energy density ( @xmath11 ) and pressure ( @xmath12 ) , on the lattice . in order to analyze euclidean space - time correlation functions of @xmath11 , @xmath12 or the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath13 , one obviously needs to use an approach to bulk thermodynamics that allows to define local operators for energy density and pressure . we will call this approach , which in fact was the basis for the original formulation of bulk thermodynamics on the lattice @xcite , the differential formalism .",
    "it is in contrast to the so - called integral method which nowadays is most commonly used in lattice calculations to extract energy density and pressure from the trace anomaly @xcite .",
    "the differential formalism has not been used recently in studies of bulk thermodynamic observables as it is more involved and requires additional non - perturbative calculations of derivatives of the bare gauge couplings with respect to the anisotropy parameter , @xmath14 , that controls the spatial ( @xmath15 ) and temporal ( @xmath16 ) lattice spacings @xcite .",
    "having control over the anisotropy is needed to derive thermodynamic quantities as function of temperature , @xmath17 , and volume , @xmath18 through appropriate partial derivatives with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath19 @xcite , although numerical calculations will generally be performed on isotropic lattice ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "in particular , for the study of the singular behavior of the energy density in the vicinity of the su(2 ) deconfinement transition this approach has been used successfully @xcite . in this context also",
    "the necessary derivatives of the gauge coupling with respect to @xmath21 had been analyzed in detail .",
    "we will follow this analysis here closely .",
    "we start from the partition function for a @xmath22 gauge theory at finite temperature , which we write in standard lattice notation @xcite , @xmath23 with @xmath24 here @xmath25 labels the discrete set of space - time points on a four - dimensional hypercubic lattice of size @xmath26 .    in the standard wilson discretization scheme the local gauge action in the @xmath27-hyperplane",
    "is expressed in terms of plaquette variables @xmath28 , with link variables @xmath29 .",
    "we write the action in terms of contributions arising only from entirely space - like plaquettes ( @xmath30 ) and space - time like plaquettes ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 we also introduce @xmath33 as the average of space - like and time - like plaquettes evaluated on a symmetric ( @xmath34 ) lattice , _ i.e. _ for @xmath35 .    from the logarithm of the partition function one obtains pressure and energy density as derivatives with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath16 , respectively @xcite , @xmath36 here @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given in terms of derivatives of the gauge coupling , @xmath39 , with respect to the anisotropy at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "their sum is constraint by the @xmath40-function , @xmath41 with these relations for @xmath11 and @xmath12 it is straightforward to obtain also the trace of the energy - momentum tensor and the entropy density , @xmath42 \\ ; ,   \\label{e3pp}\\\\ \\frac{s}{t^3 } & \\equiv & \\frac{\\epsilon+p}{t^4 } =    4 n_c n_\\tau^4\\left ( \\left [ 2g^{-2}- \\left ( c_\\sigma - c_\\tau \\right ) \\right ]    ( p_{\\sigma}-p_{\\tau } ) \\right ) \\ ; . \\label{e3p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that these particular combinations of energy density and pressure are proportional to simple sums and differences of space - like and time - like plaquette expectation values .",
    "they only require common multiplicative renormalizations for @xmath30 and @xmath31 . extracting @xmath43 or @xmath44 directly",
    ", however , involves different renormalization factors for space - like and time - like plaquette expectation values .",
    "for this reason it is straightforward to analyze correlation functions of local densities of the entropy or trace anomaly .",
    "we note that in the vicinity of the su(2 ) deconfinement transition the dominant singular behavior of @xmath45 as well as @xmath46 is controlled by the energy density .",
    "we will show later that in the vicinity of @xmath1 the pressure is an order of magnitude smaller than the energy density .",
    "when one combines @xmath45 and @xmath46 to extract the pressure it thus requires good knowledge of the renormalization factors @xmath47 and @xmath48 in order to eliminate the dominant energy contributions and arrive at a proper definition for a local operator for the pressure .",
    "this is a prerequisite for the analysis of pressure - pressure correlation functions and , as will become clear later , this becomes of importance for studies of transport coefficients , e.g. the bulk viscosity , in the vicinity of @xmath1 .      as an application of the differential formalism reviewed above",
    "we have performed a finite size scaling analysis of the critical energy density and the pressure at the deconfinement transition temperature of the su(2 ) gauge theory .",
    "this extends earlier studies of the critical energy density performed in ref .",
    "@xcite to larger lattices and yields , for the first time , a determination of the pressure at the critical point .",
    "the deconfinement transition of the su(2 ) gauge theory in ( 3 + 1)-dimensions is in the same universality class as the 3-dimensional ising model .",
    "its critical behavior is well understood and has been confirmed in various finite size scaling studies . on a lattice of size @xmath49 energy density and pressure at the critical point",

    "[ fig : bulkscaling ] we show results for the volume dependence of various bulk thermodynamic observables .",
    "it clearly can be seen that the scaling behaviour of the pressure is different from that of the other three observables .",
    "moreover , it is apparent that the pressure is more than an order of magnitude smaller than any of the observables that contain contributions of the energy density .",
    "this shows that the finite size scaling behavior of @xmath70 and @xmath71 is dominated by the non - analytic behavior of the energy density and thus is expected to be controlled by the same ansatz as for the energy density given in eq .",
    "we also note that cut - off effects seem to be small already for lattices with temporal extent @xmath72 and that the volume dependence starts being controlled by the scaling variable @xmath73 .",

    "we have performed corresponding analyzes for @xmath59 and @xmath55 which are consistent with these findings , however statistical errors are larger in these cases .",
    "the analysis presented above confirms that the correlation function @xmath87 contains a constant contribution that arises from low frequency modes that lead to the singular behavior of the energy - energy correlation function at @xmath1 . in the continuum limit",

    "we will show here that this is also the case at temperatures in the vicinity of @xmath1 at which the universal scaling behavior allows to separate the long - distance singular behavior of @xmath91 from regular contributions .    in fig .",

    "@xcite .    to get direct access to the bulk viscosity @xmath2 and the characteristic frequency @xmath127 that controls the relaxation time for density fluctuations will require much more detailed studies of the dependence of correlation functions on euclidean time .",

    "<S> we calculate correlation functions of the energy - momentum tensor in the vicinity of the deconfinement phase transition of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional su(2 ) gauge theory and discuss their critical behavior in the vicinity of the second order deconfinement transition . </S>",
    "<S> we show that correlation functions of the trace of the energy momentum tensor diverge uniformly at the critical point in proportion to the specific heat singularity . </S>",
    "<S> correlation functions of the pressure , on the other hand , stay finite at the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the consequences of these findings for the analysis of transport coefficients , in particular the bulk viscosity , in the vicinity of a second order phase transition point . </S>"
