    "quantum entanglement is one of the most subtle and intriguing property of the nature in the entire physics history .",
    "when two pair - created particles fly away from each other , their states are entangled even after their separation is beyond causal contact .",
    "that is the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pair @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", einstein - rosen bridge @xcite connects far separated regions by short wormholes .",
    "both of them shares the common nature such that causally disconnected objects or region are tied although no information can be transmitted through them .",
    "recently maldacena and susskind @xcite conjectured that any epr pair might be connected through a wormhole of some kind .",
    "it was dubbed as ` epr = er ' .",
    "if true , it would be a fascinating connection between quantum mechanics and space - time geometry giving an enlightenment on this long standing mystery of modern physics .",
    "soon after this suggestion , jensen and karch @xcite and sonner @xcite discussed the entanglement of a pair of accelerating quark and antiquark in the context of the ads / cft correspondence , using the corresponding minimal surface obtained by ref .",
    "it allows one to consider only a classical world - sheet configuration where causal structure makes sense .",
    "it was shown that the trajectories of quark and antiquark are connected by a line that has to pass through the world - sheet wormhole zone , thereby supporting the epr = er with the space - time wormhole replaced by the world - sheet one .",
    "@xcite suggested that the gluonic radiation between the quark and antiquark induces their entanglement .",
    "it is very interesting to see what happens to other exactly known world - sheet configuration @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall consider the four - gluon scattering , whose minimal surface was well studied by alday and maldacena @xcite .",
    "we shall study its causal structure in its t - dual space - time picture and conclude that epr = er is also supported in this case .",
    "another related question is how to quantify the degree of entanglement .",
    "notice that without interaction , unentangled state can not be entangled and vice versa .",
    "for example , in a scattering process of two particles starting with unentangled initial state , the final state is entangled if and only if there is an interaction , because the time evolution operator @xmath0 $ ] factorizes iff @xmath1 .",
    "the entanglement entropy ( ee ) of the final state is the _ change _ of ee , @xmath2 , created by the interaction during the scattering process .",
    "so _ the change of ee must be related to the interaction _",
    ", hence we expect that the ee change is related to the scattering amplitude itself . in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , the scattering amplitude can be related to the area of the minimal surface of the wilson loop of trajectories of scattering particles @xcite , one way is to extend the ee derived from the minimal surface by ryu and takayanagi @xcite .",

    "we comment on the regge limit , @xmath119 .",

    "can we generalize above result to more general scattering particles ?",
    "we believe this is the case . to show this we give a construction by which @xmath2 can be identified as the scattering amplitude .",
    "first we can extend the ryu - takayanagi formulation of ee by allowing the subspace a and b to be the space - time regions ( rather than spatial regions ) whose minimal surface in ads generates the change in the ee . in case of world - line of scattering quark - antiquark pair , it is nothing but the minimal surface calculating the wilson lines .",
    "that is , for any two scattering particles a and b , there is an infinite line @xmath121 connecting them at each time @xmath23 .",
    "( a ) the scattering surface in the boundary theory .",
    "( b ) the minimal surface of wilson lines . ]",
    "as time evolves , @xmath121 generates a two - dimensional surface in the entire space - time of boundary field theory , which we call a scattering surface ( fig .",
    "[ figscatsurface](a ) ) .",
    "then the world - lines of the two particles will divide the scattering surface into two , @xmath107 and @xmath109 . considering the constantly accelerating particles",
    "whose minimal surfaces is found in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can exemplify these idea .",
    "the trajectory of two particles forms a circle in eudlideanized space - time .",
    "the minimal surface of circle is well studied , and its area is given by @xmath122 independent of the acceleration @xcite .",
    "this construction shows a way to identify the scattering amplitude as a change of ee .",
    "notice that the change of ee between initial and final states is a function of the whole scattering process .",
    "therefore this change should be related to s - matrix .",
    "the term , @xmath123 , in @xmath2 comes from the replica trick in the derivation of ee . on the other hand , in the language of scattering",
    ", that term corresponds to bremsstralung of radiative correction .",
    "actually in the case of accelerating quark - antiquark , @xmath123 is proportional to the bremsstralung function @xcite",
    ". therefore the change of ee , @xmath2 , is related with s - matrix , which gives a scattering amplitude in principle including a radiative correction .",
    "we studied the causal structure on the open string world - sheet of gluon scattering minimal surface in position space . on this world - sheet",
    "there exists the wormhole which separates the lorentzian regions including the boundary .",
    "gluons are given by the open strings .",
    "we have shown that any paths connecting such two open string gluons at any time slices pass through the wormhole .",
    "therefore a wormhole can always be associated with the entanglement of interacting gluons .",
    "this result supports the epr = er conjecture .",
    "* one may ask why entanglement should be related to the interaction , because entanglement is property of the state not the hamiltonian . consider scattering of two particles which are initially ( at @xmath124 ) far separated and un - entangled .",
    "we can construct the basis of in- and out- states by tensor product of free particle states .",
    "let the initial state @xmath125 to be a tensor product state @xmath126 they approach each other and interact and then go force - free region after long time @xmath127 .",
    "such time evolution is given by the evolution operator @xmath128 $ ] or s - matrix : @xmath129 which is entangled in general unless interaction @xmath1 so that @xmath130 is factorized .",
    "so the final state of two free particles are entangled and its ee can be identified as the ` change ' of ee of the two particle system .",
    "our question is that how to relate the latter to the s - matrix itself , which seems to be non - trivial task in field theory setting . *",
    "if the final state involves sum over all possible quantum states , why one can consider only one world - sheet ? in classical mechanics , final configuration is completely determined if initial one is given .",
    "now in the ads / cft , due to the large @xmath131 nature , classical discussion can be made .",
    "that is , when we consider a minimal surface whose boundary is the trajectories of two scattering particles , we implicitly assumed that such classical picture is valid in describing the gluon - gluon or heavy quark - antiquark scatterings .",
    "therefore we do not sum over trajectories and hence not sum over the world - sheets .",
    "this is the reason why we can consider the causal structure of a single world sheet of the gluon scattering instead of summing over such world - sheets .",
    "the same philosophy was implicitly assumed in the discussions of causal structure of world - sheet in recent literature . with these understanding",
    ", we observed the ee change ( [ eescat ] ) , following the holographic calculations by ref .",
    "this ee change becomes minimum at @xmath47 and diverges at the regge limit @xmath132 .",
    "the relation shows that the change of ee is a function of dynamical process , which is natural .",
    "here it was shown by holographic argument and mostly likely it is true only in the holographic context where semi - classical nature holds .",
    "it would be interesting to see how this relation in the general quantum field theory can be written .",
    "* another point that should be discussed further in the future is the conjecture we used : the ee of wilson loop can be calculated by the minimal surface associated with the wilson loop expectation value . which was proven only simplest cases .",
    "even providing more examples will be interesting .",
