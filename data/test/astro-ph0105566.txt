    "henize 2 - 10 is a dwarf elliptical galaxy with a starburst nucleus and the first wolf - rayet galaxy identified .",
    "gas motions in and around he 2 - 10 suggest that it is in an advanced stage of accretion , which may be the trigger for the starburst @xcite .",
    "he 2 - 10 differs from most dwarf starburst galaxies in that it has at least solar @xcite to twice solar @xcite metal abundances and is relatively rich in molecular gas .",
    "single - dish radio continuum fluxes of the galaxy as a whole have the non - thermal spectral index of -0.56 @xcite , similar to spiral galaxies and much steeper than most dwarf starbursts . its distance is determined only to be between 6 and 14 mpc ; we will use 9 mpc here .",
    "the starburst in he 2 - 10 takes the form of a disk 5 - 8  in length and 2 - 3  in height . @xcite found optical and uv super - star clusters lying in this disk , and @xcite showed that the near - infrared j , h , and k emission traces it .",
    "the disk is perpendicular to the bi - polar outflow of ionized gas described in @xcite and to the apparent angle of the in - falling molecular gas @xcite . @xcite",
    "measured the radio continuum at 6 and 2 cm with sub - arcsec resolution and found the same disk - like structure breaks up into 6 sub - sources , 5 of which are strong enough to be fit and analysed individually , and all of which are stronger at 2 cm than 6 cm .",
    "a rising spectrum can be the sign of a radio source that is at least partly optically thick at the longer wavelength .",
    "@xcite concluded that the rising spectrum sources are probably giant hii regions excited by hundreds of o stars and containing such dense gas that their intrinsically thermal @xmath0 spectrum has been distorted by optical depth effects .",
    "such sources have been seen in ngc 5253 @xcite and ngc 4214 @xcite .",
    "near - flat or rising radio spectra are also seen , however , in non - thermal sources not excited by young stars , including agn and snr .",
    "the best test for the presence of young stars is the infrared flux : hii regions will have strong and predictable ir emission and the other candidates will not @xcite .",
    "it is a particularly good way to weed out snr , which are weak ir emitters but strong radio emitters , and often present in large numbers in starburst regions .",
    "the infrared is also the wavelength of choice for probing star formation regions in general , and can be expected to be particularly useful in he 2 - 10 where the radio and optical appearance , although similar in outline , are greatly different in detail , and where the optical extinction is known to be very high @xcite .",
    "@xcite imaged he 2 - 10 in the mid - ir with 1.1 \" resolution at the cfht ; their raw images at 11.7 @xmath1 m show two main ir sources possibly associated with 4 of the 5 images ; deconvolution reveals a possible third , weaker source to the east of the main emission . to better match the resolution of the radio observations , we have accordingly obtained high resolution ( @xmath20.3 ) middle - infrared ( 11.7 micron ) images of the central disk in he 2 - 10 using the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ; *",
    "* ) on the keck telescope .",
    "we describe the observations and results in the next section and discuss the peculiarities of he 2 - 10 in section 3 .",
    "he 2 - 10 was observed on 17 february 2000 at the keck i telescope , using the lws in imaging mode with a 1 micron wide filter centered at 11.7 microns .",
    "the standard stars @xmath3 gemini and @xmath4 bootes were used for calibration .",
    "the sky was unstable and non - photometric ; the internal scatter in the standards was 7% or lower over time spans of an hour but showed jumps of 18% over longer periods .",
    "the calibration is further complicated by characteristics of the chip .",
    "the pixel size is 0.08  and the chip is 128 x 128 , and the resulting 10  field is close enough to the size of the source that it is very difficult to find and subtract the sky background , a problem complicated by fringing at the edge of the chip and significant pixel - to - pixel variations in the noise . for these reasons we conservatively estimate the error in the total fluxes assigned to each source to be 15 - 20% .",
    "the angular resolution , based on the fwhm of the standard stars , is 0.3  to 0.5 .",
    "two exposures of 216 on - source seconds each were obtained of he 2 - 10 ; they were added with no smoothing and the resulting image , rotated to the conventional nuel orientation , is shown in figure 1 . in figure 2 the infrared image is shown with the 2 cm radio contours ( kindly provided by h.a .",
    "kobulnicky ) superimposed .",
    "since the absolute registration of the infrared image is good only to about 1  the superposition was adjusted by eye .",
    "the infrared image of he 2 - 10 shows 3 sources in a roughly east - west line .",
    "the eastern and western infrared sources are individually extended east - west also , following the 5 smaller radio knots seen by @xcite .",
    "we will therefore treat the infrared sources as emitted by 3 sources , which from east to west we call a , including radio knots 4 and 5 , b which corresponds to radio knot 3 , and c which includes radio knots 1 and 2 . in table 1",
    "we give the infrared flux of each extended source , along with the radio flux for the region measured from the 2 cm map for the extended infrared region , and the ratio of radio to infrared emission .",
    "our 2 cm fluxes are those of the entire extended source and therefore larger than those of @xcite , which were obtained by fitting gaussian sources to the central cores of the nebulae .",
    "the mid - infrared fluxes we obtain are in good agreement with those observed at lower resolution by @xcite , although we find that the infrared sources are more extended than predicted by their deconvolution routines , and slightly higher than the values found by @xcite .",
    "the ratio of infrared to thermal radio flux from an hii region depends on the type and temperature of the dust .",
    "lyman @xmath4 dust heating alone gives a ratio of 10 , but the value usually observed in starburst galaxies and galactic star formation regions is between 120 - 250 , the excess generally due to dust heating by longer wavelengths and optical depth effects in the radio .",
    "> from table 1 we see that all the sources in he 2 - 10 , with values @xmath280 , are definitely in the regime of hii regions and not , for example , snr whose infrared fluxes are many orders of magnitude weaker .",
    "this confirms the identification of the radio sources as compact hii regions @xcite .",
    "the relative fluxes of all three components are identical in the radio and infrared : 67% of the flux is in component a , 8% in b , and 22% in c.    while the infrared and radio emission in the three components agree over sizescales of @xmath5 their distribution is different in detail .",
    "the radio emission is more compact than is the infrared .",
    "the radio sources have cores of @xmath6  @xcite , surrounded by flatter extended halos so the total sizes are similar to the infrared .",
    "the infrared sources are larger ; when deconvolved from the @xmath7 psf , component a is @xmath8or @xmath9pc , b is @xmath10  or 13 pc , and c is @xmath11  ( 22 pc ) .",
    "the radio beam is about twice as large as the infrared ns and slightly larger ew , yet the radio sources appear more compact , and the infrared sources do not have the core and background structure of the radio .",
    "a remarkable result from the infrared image is that the clumpy disk appears within the uncertainties to provide least 80% of the total flux seen by iras at 12 @xmath1 m with a beam that included the entire galaxy .",
    "this total is that of the 5 clumps together ; we do not see an extended smooth infrared component .",
    "he 2 - 10 is another case ( like ngc 5253 , @xcite ) of a starburst dwarf in the great majority of ob star formation is concentrated in a small volume , but unlike ngc 5253 the star formation activity is not in a single super cluster but in a much more complex geometry .",
    "if we fit a modified blackbody spectrum with @xmath12 to our 11.7 @xmath1 m and iras fluxes , the observed 11.7 , 12 , and 25 @xmath1 m fluxes can be fit with a 120k source .",
    "this 120k source would account for most of the iras 12 and 25 @xmath1 m flux and thus 40% of the total iras luminosity of @xmath13 .    using a reference ob star luminosity of @xmath14 for an o7 star ,",
    "we calculate the ob star content of each infrared source from its mid - infrared luminosity as listed in table 1 .",
    "we also list the ob star content derived from the radio fluxes , using the assumption that they are optically thin @xcite . if the hii regions have optically thick components , or if dust absorbs a significant number of the photons , then this will be an underestimate of the number of massive young stars .",
    "note that the numbers of ob stars found for the three components based on these two very different methods for the radio and infrared agree very well .",
    "the mid - infrared luminosities of regions a , b , and c agree with the ionization requirements of the radio knots , which argues that the radio emission can not be very optically thick on these sizescales .",
    "the rising radio spectra must be attributed only to the central cores of the nebulae .",
    "the radio / infrared sources contain very dense gas , as @xcite calculated from the radio optical depths , and a great deal of dust to account for their high extinction and infrared flux , and must therefore be very young . if one estimates a dynamical age based on the time it would take them to expand to the stage of having a normal radio spectrum , one obtains ages of 500,000 years @xcite .",
    "however this assumes that there are no other forces working against their expansion . the apparent contradiction between the very short dynamical lifetimes of compact hii regions and their ubiquity has been reviewed by @xcite .",
    "the possible confinement mechanisms suggested for ngc 5253 by @xcite(i.e .",
    "magnetic fields of the milligauss level , gravity ) may also be at work in he 2 - 10 . in the case of he 2 - 10",
    ", the more traditional suggestion of confinement by dense molecular gas is also a viable source of extra overpressure which can keep the nebulae confined and the gas density high .",
    "the age of the he 2 - 10 nebulae can be estimated independently from the mid - infrared line spectrum of @xcite and the ionization of a starburst as modelled by @xcite . the models can reproduce the infrared line spectrum if the starburst in he 2 - 10 is relatively old , from 0.5 to @xmath15 years @xcite .",
    "this is not only much older than the dynamical age , a problem which appears in many other sources , it is as old or older than the super star clusters observed in the optical and uv in the same galaxy @xcite .",
    "it is very hard to find a physically sensible scenario in which the optically visible star clusters , which have already dispersed their gas and dust , are younger than the infrared and radio sources which are still embedded in gas and dust .",
    "it is possible that the age derived from the infrared spectrum is misleading .",
    "first , the infrared spectrum may be softened by higher than solar metallicity so the clumps may contain younger and hotter stars than the rather cool ones found by the models .",
    "second , the ages found from these models assume that the burst formed with very massive stars present and that the soft ionization currently observed means that stars more massive than 35@xmath16 have disappeared .",
    "the models can not at present distinguish between a burst of @xmath17 to @xmath15 years with an initial upper mass cutoff of 60@xmath16 and a much younger burst whose initial mass function did not extend past 35@xmath16 to begin with .",
    "middle - infrared diagnostics of stellar age are greatly needed , as only in the middle - infrared can these very young and obscured hii regions be observed properly .",
    "we can only conclude that while these compact nebulae are doubtless the youngest part of the starburst their age can not be determined to better than a factor of 10 .",
    "the high - resolution radio , infrared and optical observations of he 2 - 10 find an extended disk that contains or is made out of many clumps , probably star clusters , some of which can be seen in the optical and the others only at the longer wavelengths .",
    "other dwarf galaxies are known to contain intense and small infrared and radio clumps excited by the youngest star clusters but they have either only one young , embedded cluster ( ngc 5253 ) or a few clusters with no clear underlying structure ( ngc 4214 , @xcite ) .",
    "he 2 - 10 is so far unique among dwarf galaxies in that its youngest star clusters are associated with a disk . the cluster distribution in he 2 - 10 in in fact reminiscent of that seen in spiral starburst galaxies like ngc 253 .",
    "why is he 2 - 10 so different from other galaxies of its apparent class ?",
    "we note that the extent of the `` disk '' ( or linear structure ) is @xmath2 200 pc , possibly more if there is signifiant extension in the line of sight , which corresponds a sound - crossing time of at least @xmath18 years .",
    "this is far greater than the inferred ages of the compact hii regions and suggests a star formation trigger .",
    "the infrared structure may reflect the rotating molecular gas disk whose morphology and kinematics are described by @xcite .",
    "if molecular gas accretes onto a galaxy with a rotating disk , it will not matter where or at what angle it starts , it quickly ends up falling onto the disk .",
    "so the accretion induced star formation will be concentrated in the disk , where local conditions and perhaps self - gravity structures will determine the size and nature of the star clusters that will form .",
    "another feature of he 2 - 10 which differs from the usual dwarf starburst galaxy is its metal content , which is around twice solar ( from the neii flux observed by @xcite ) , rather than the approximately 0.1 solar seen in ngc 5253 , ii zw 40 and many others .",
    "this may have an effect on the future evolution of the observed infared star clusters .",
    "young stars have violent mass outflow episodes which can partly disrupt a cluster and these winds are stronger at higher metallicity .",
    "we speculate that the clusters in the disk of he 2 - 10 will in a few tens or hundreds of myr be too small and faint to be true globular clusters . even without the effect of winds",
    "it is hard to tell what kind of clusters these sources will become , because of the relatively low spatial resolution we have at the distance of he 2 - 10 .",
    "source a , for example , contains about twice as many ob stars as does the supercluster in ngc 5253 @xcite , more than enough stars to evolve into a globular cluster , but we do nt yet know if it contains more sub - sources than the two already seen and what the volumes and stellar densities will be .",
    "mid - infrared images of the dwarf starburst galaxy he 2 - 10 were obtained with the lws on the keck telescope . the images show infrared clumps along the galaxy disk which coincide with the rising spectrum radio sources seen by @xcite .",
    "the image shows that the mid - infrared emission is more extended than the radio emission , but is otherwise in excellent agreement .",
    "this confirms that the sources are compact hii regions excited by large and extremely young super star clusters .",
    "at least 80% of the middle - infrared flux of the galaxy , as seen in iras , comes from the vicinity of these compact nebulae which extend over 200@xmath19100 pc , and which emit @xmath240% of the total infrared luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "he 2 - 10 is another example of a starburst galaxy where the current star formation activity is very intense and confined to a very small volume .",
    "we suggest that the disk is the site of the starburst because that is where the accreted molecular gas is falling , triggering the burst .",
    "we also suggest that due to the high metal content the clusters are unlikely to survive the 10 gyr to become true globulars .",
