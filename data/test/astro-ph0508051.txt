    "sato et al .  ( 2005 ) recently presented the discovery of a planetary companion to the bright g0  iv star hd  149026 .",
    "the star exhibits a time - variable doppler shift that is consistent with a sinusoid of amplitude @xmath8  m  s@xmath9 and period @xmath10  days , which would be produced by the gravitational force from an orbiting planet with @xmath11  @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , at the predicted time of planet - star conjunction , the star s flux declines by 0.3% in the manner expected of an eclipse by a planet of radius @xmath13  @xmath14 ( given an estimate of the stellar radius , 1.45  @xmath15 , that is based on the stellar parallax and effective temperature ) .",
    "sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) observed three such eclipses .",
    "this discovery is extraordinary for at least two reasons .",
    "firstly , the occurrence of eclipses admits this system into the elite club of bright stars with detectable planetary transits .",
    "of all the previously - known transiting systems , only hd  209458 ( charbonneau et al .",
    "2000 ; henry et al .",
    "2000 ) and tres-1 ( alonso et al .  2004 ; sozzetti et al .",
    "2005 ) have parent stars brighter than @xmath16 , and therefore only they are amenable to a number of fascinating measurements requiring a very high signal - to - noise ratio . among these studies",
    "are ( i ) the search for satellites and rings ( brown et al .",
    "2001 ) , ( ii ) the search for period variations due to additional companions ( wittenmyer et al .",
    "2005 ) , ( iii ) the detection of ( or upper limits on ) atmospheric absorption features in transmission ( charbonneau et al .  2002 ;",
    "brown , libbrecht , & charbonneau 2002 ; deming et al .",
    "2005a ) , ( iv ) the characterization of the exosphere ( bundy & marcy 2000 ; moutou et al .",

    "2005 ) , ( v ) the measurement of the angle between the sky - projected orbit normal and stellar rotation axis ( queloz et al .",
    "2000 ; winn et al .  2005 ) , and ( vi ) the search for spectroscopic features near the times of secondary eclipse ( richardson et al .  2003a , 2003b ) , and ( vii ) the direct detection of thermal emission from the planet ( charbonneau et al .",
    "2005 ; deming et al .",
    "charbonneau ( 2004 ) reviews these techniques and related investigations .",
    "secondly , the planet is the smallest and least massive of the 8 known transiting extrasolar planets .",
    "this makes hd  149026b an important test case for theories of planetary structure .",
    "sato et al.(2005 ) argued that , once the effects of stellar insolation are included , the small planetary radius implies that the planet has a large and dense core .",
    "in particular , assuming a core density @xmath17 , their models predict a prodigious core mass of 78  earth masses , or 74% of the total mass of the planet .",
    "this , in turn , would seemingly prove that the planet formed through core accretion , as opposed to direct collapse through a gravitational instability",
    ".    a system of such importance should be independently confirmed , and the determination of its basic parameters should be refined through multiple observations . with this as motivation , we performed photometry of hd  149026 on two different nights when transits were predicted by sato et al .",
    "these observations and the data reduction procedures are described in   2 .",
    "the model that we used to determine the system parameters is described in   3 , and the results are discussed in   4 .",
    "our data are available in digital form in the electronic version of this article , and from the authors upon request .",
    "we observed hd  149026 ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) on ut  2005  june  6 and ut  2005  july  2 with the 48-inch ( 1.2 m ) telescope of the f.  l.  whipple observatory ( flwo ) located at mount hopkins , arizona .",
    "we used minicam , an optical ccd imager with two @xmath20 chips . in order to increase the duty cycle of the observations",
    ", we employed @xmath21  binning , which reduced the readout and overhead time to 20  s. each binned pixel subtends approximately @xmath22 on the sky , giving an effective field of view of about @xmath23 for each ccd .",
    "fortunately , there exists a nearby object of similar brightness and color ( hd  149083 ; @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26  @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) , which we employed as an extinction calibrator .",
    "we selected the telescope pointing so that both stars were imaged simultaneously .",
    "we defocused the telescope so that the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of a stellar image was typically 15 binned pixels ( 9@xmath29 ) , and we used automatic guiding to ensure that the centroid of the stellar images drifted no more than 3 binned pixels over the course of the night .",
    "in addition to enabling longer integration times , this served to mitigate the effects of pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations that were not perfectly corrected by our flat - fielding procedure . on ut  2005  june  6",
    ", we gathered 5.5  hrs of sdss @xmath0-band observations with typical integration times of 8  s and a cadence of 28  s. the conditions were photometric , and the frames span an airmass from 1.01 to 1.74 . on ut",
    "2005  july  2 , we gathered 4.4  hrs of sdss @xmath2-band observations with integration times of 6  s and a median cadence of 26  s. the field appeared to remain free of clouds for the duration of the observations , which spanned an airmass range of 1.01 to 1.43 , although occasional patches of high cirrus could be seen in images from the mmt all - sky camera .",
    "we converted the image time stamps to heliocentric julian day ( hjd ) at mid - exposure .",
    "the images were overscan - subtracted , trimmed , and divided by a flat - field image .",
    "we performed aperture photometry of hd  149026 and the comparison star hd  149083 , using an aperture radius of 15 binned pixels ( 9@xmath29 ) for the ut  2005  june  6 data , and an aperture radius of 20 binned pixels ( 12@xmath29 ) for the ut  2005  july  2 data .",
    "we subtracted the underlying contribution from the sky for both the target and calibrator by estimating the counts in an annulus exterior to the photometric aperture .",
    "the relative flux of hd  149026 was computed as the ratio of the fluxes within the two apertures .",
    "normalization and residual extinction corrections are described in   3 .",
    "tophat is an automated telescope located on mt .",
    "hopkins , arizona , which was designed to perform multi - color photometric follow - up of transiting extrasolar planet candidates identified by the hat network ( bakos et al .",
    "since tophat has not previously been described in the literature , we digress briefly to outline the principal goals and features of the instrument .",
    "wide - field transit surveys must contend with a large rate of astrophysical false positives , which result from stellar systems that contain an eclipsing binary and precisely mimic the single - color photometric light curve of a jupiter - sized planet transiting a sun - like star ( brown 2003 ; charbonneau et al .",
    "2004 ; mandushev et al .",
    "2005 ; torres et al .",
    "although multi - epoch radial velocity follow - up is an effective tool for identifying these false positives ( e.g. latham 2003 ) , instruments such as tophat and sherlock ( kotredes et al .",
    "2004 ) can be fully - automated , and thus offer a very efficient means of culling the bulk of such false positives .",
    "tophat is a 0.26 m diameter f/5 commercially - available baker ritchey - chrtien telescope on an equatorial fork mount developed by fornax inc .",
    "a 1@xmath3025-square field of view is imaged onto a 2k@xmath312k peltier - cooled , thinned ccd detector , yielding a pixel scale of 2@xmath322 .",

    "a two - slot filter - exchanger permits imaging in either @xmath1 or @xmath33 .",
    "the components are protected from inclement weather by an automated asymmetric clamshell dome .",
    "we observed hd  149026 on ut 2005 july 2 , the same night as the flwo 1.2 m @xmath2 observations described above . in order to extend the integration times and increase the duty cycle of the observations",
    ", we broadened the point spread function ( psf ) by performing small , regular motions in ra and dec according to a prescribed pattern that was repeated during each 13  s integration ( see bakos et al .",
    "2004 for details ) .",
    "the resulting psf had a fwhm of 3.5 pixels ( 7@xmath327 ) .",
    "we gathered 4.8  hrs of @xmath1 observations with a cadence of 68  s , spanning an airmass range of 1.01 to 1.45 .",
    "we converted the time stamps in the image headers to hjd at mid - exposure .",
    "we calibrated the images by subtracting the overscan bias and a scaled dark image , and dividing by an average sky flat from which large outliers had been rejected .",
    "we evaluated the centroids of the target and the three brightest calibrators in each image . for each star",
    ", we summed the flux within an aperture with a radius of 8  pixels ( 17@xmath326 ) , and subtracted a local sky estimate based on the median flux in an annulus exterior to the photometric aperture .",
    "we divided the resulting time series for the target by the statistically - weighted average of the time series for the three calibrator stars .",
    "the resulting relative flux time series was then corrected for normalization and residual extinction effects as described in the following section .",
    "we attempted to fit simultaneously ( i ) the 3 photometric time series discussed above , ( ii ) the @xmath34 photometry of 3 transits presented by sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and ( iii ) the 7 radial velocities that were measured by sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) when the planet was not transiting .",
    "we did not attempt to fit the 4 radial velocities measured during transits , which would have required a model of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( queloz et al.2002 ; ohta , taruya , & suto 2004 ; winn et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we modeled the system as a circular keplerian orbit .",
    "following sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we assumed the stellar mass ( @xmath35 ) to be @xmath36 and the stellar radius ( @xmath37 ) to be @xmath38 .",
    "the free parameters were the planetary mass ( @xmath39 ) , planetary radius ( @xmath40 ) , orbital inclination ( @xmath41 ) , orbital period ( @xmath42 ) , central transit time ( @xmath43 ) , and the heliocentric radial velocity of the center of mass ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we included 2 free parameters for each of our 3 photometric time series : an overall flux scaling @xmath45 ; and a residual extinction coefficient ( @xmath46 ) to correct for differential extinction between the target star and the comparison object , which have somewhat different colors .",
    "these are defined such that the relative flux observed through an airmass @xmath47 is @xmath48 times the true relative flux .",
    "the residual extinction corrections were small but important at the millimagnitude level ; for example , in the @xmath0 band , we found @xmath49 .",
    "the 3 time series presented by sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) were already corrected for airmass , so we allowed each of these to have only an independent flux scaling .",
    "finally , we allowed the data from each spectrograph ( keck / hires and subaru / hds ) to have an independent value of @xmath44 .",
    "we computed the model radial velocity at each observed time as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the line - of - sight projection of the orbital velocity of the star .",
    "we calculated the model flux during transit using the linear limb - darkening law @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the normalized stellar surface brightness profile and @xmath54 is the cosine of the angle between the normal to the stellar surface and the line of sight .",
    "we employed the `` small planet '' approximation as described by mandel & agol ( 2002 ) .",
    "we held the limb darkening parameter @xmath55 fixed at a value appropriate for a star with the assumed properties , and for the bandpass concerned , according to the models of claret & hauschildt ( 2003 ) and claret ( 2004 ) .",
    "these values were @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the goodness - of - fit parameter is @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the observed and calculated radial velocities , of which there are @xmath63 , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the observed and calculated fluxes , of which there are @xmath66 . of the flux measurements , 679 are our @xmath0-band measurements , 574 are our @xmath2-band measurements , 237 are our @xmath1-band measurements , and 820 are the @xmath67/2 measurements of sato et al .",
    "we minimized @xmath68 using an amoeba algorithm ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the radial velocity uncertainties @xmath69 were taken from table  2 of sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . to estimate the uncertainties in our photometry , we performed the following procedure .",
    "we expect the two dominant sources of uncertainty to be scintillation noise ( @xmath70 ) and poisson noise ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "young ( 1967 ) advocated an approximate scaling law for the fractional error due to scintillation noise ( see also dravins et al .",
    "1998 ) : @xmath72 where @xmath47 is the airmass , @xmath73 is the diameter of the aperture , @xmath74 is the exposure time , and @xmath75 is the altitude of the observatory . for each of our 3 time series",
    ", we assumed that the noise in each point obeyed @xmath76 where @xmath70 was calculated with eq .",
    "[ eq : scintillation ] .",
    "we determined the constant @xmath77 by requiring @xmath78 for that particular time series .",
    "thus we did _ not _ attempt to use the @xmath68 statistic to test the validity of the model ; rather , we assumed the model is correct , and sought the appropriate weight for each data point .",
    "the results for @xmath77 ranged from 1.2 to 1.5 . to estimate the uncertainties in each of the three sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) time series ( which were already corrected for airmass ) , we simply assigned an airmass - independent error bar to all the points such that @xmath78 .",
    "the results agreed well with the rms values quoted in table  5 of sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "after assigning the weight of each data point in this manner , we analyzed all the data simultaneously and found the best - fitting solution .",
    "this solution is overplotted on the data in figure  1 .",
    "our photometry , after correcting for the overall flux scale and for airmass , is given in table  1 .",
    "we estimated the uncertainties in the model parameters using a monte carlo algorithm , in which the optimization was performed on each of @xmath79 synthetic data sets , and the distribution of best - fitting values was taken to be the joint probability distribution of the parameters .",
    "each synthetic data set was created as follows :    1 .",
    "we randomly drew @xmath66 flux measurements @xmath80 from the real data set .",
    "we drew these points with replacement , i.e. , we allowed for repetitions of the original data points .",
    "this procedure , recommended by press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , estimates the probability distribution of the measurements using the measured data values themselves , rather than the more traditional approach of assuming a certain model for the underlying process .",
    "this procedure was impractical for the radial velocity measurements , because the number of data points is too small .",
    "instead , in each realization , we discarded a single radial velocity measurement chosen at random .",
    "this was intended as a test of the robustness of the results to single outliers . to each of the remaining @xmath81 radial velocities",
    ", we added a random number drawn from a gaussian distribution , with zero mean and a standard deviation equal to the quoted 1  @xmath82 uncertainty .",
    "3 .   to account for the uncertainty in the stellar properties",
    ", we assigned a stellar mass by picking a random number from a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath36 and standard deviation @xmath83 .",
    "likewise , for the stellar radius , we used a gaussian distribution with a mean of @xmath38 and a standard deviation of @xmath84 .",
    "we note that this procedure does not take into account the intrinsic correlation between these two variables that is expected from models of stellar structure and evolution . assuming a stellar mass - radius relation would provide an independent constraint that would reduce the overall uncertainty on the planetary radius ( cody & sasselov 2002 ) .",
    "we elected not to make such an assumption because the stellar age , and therefore its evolutionary state , are not known with sufficient precision .",
    "the best - fitting model is illustrated in fig .  1 . the estimated probability distribution for each model parameter is shown in fig .",
    "2 . some of the parameters have correlated uncertainties , as shown in fig .",
    "in addition to showing correlations among the model parameters , fig .  3 shows the distributions for three fundamental properties of a single - transit light curve : the transit depth in the absence of stellar limb - darkening , defined as @xmath85 ; the transit duration , defined as the time between first and fourth contact ( @xmath86 ) ; and the ingress duration , defined as the time between first and second contact ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "since we have assumed a circular keplerian orbit , the ingress and egress durations are equal .",
    "the contact times can be calculated from our model parameters via the relations @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the semi - major axis , given by kepler s law @xmath90 .",
    "we found that the probability distributions did not depend significantly on which of the 7 radial velocity measurements were discarded , with the important exception of the third subaru / hds measurement ( @xmath91  m  s@xmath9 at hjd  2453208.909939 ) .",
    "when this point was dropped , the results for the orbital period , planetary mass , and velocity offsets changed by 1  @xmath82 . in fig .  2 , the solid histograms show the results of the @xmath92 trials for which @xmath93 was discarded , and the dotted histograms show the results of all @xmath79 trials .",
    "we believe that either the model fails to accurately describe @xmath93 within its quoted uncertainty ( due to a missing ingredient such as a nonzero eccentricity within the quoted uncertainty . in the best - fitting model , @xmath94 and @xmath95 . ] or an additional planetary companion ) , or that the true uncertainty in this measurement is larger than the estimate ( due to stellar jitter or some other source of systematic error ) . in support of this claim ,",
    "we note that this single point makes a disproportionate contribution to @xmath96 .",
    "when any single radial velocity measurement besides @xmath93 is dropped , the minimum @xmath96 ranges from 13 to 19 . yet when @xmath93 is dropped , @xmath97 . in table  2",
    ", we present the results for the cases in which @xmath93 is dropped .",
    "our intention is to avoid biased results from an oversimplified model or an underestimated uncertainty .    the one - dimensional probability distribution for @xmath41 shows that the majority of solutions favor @xmath98 , but a peak is evident at @xmath99 ( see the lower left panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "we identify these maximum-@xmath41 solutions by applying an arbitrary cut - off of @xmath100 , and we display these solutions with a distinct coloring in fig .  3 .",
    "these solutions , which account for 9% of the total , represent a pile - up at equatorial configurations owing to the numerical constraint @xmath101 .",
    "we exclude this solution subset prior to determining the best - fit values and confidence limits listed in table  2 .",
    "we note that the duration of ingress and egress is significantly shorter for hd  149026 than for either hd  209458 or tres-1 .",
    "the available photometry samples the times of ingress and egress only sparsely .",
    "we encourage high - cadence monitoring of these key portions of the transit curve .",
    "tabulation of the observed time of each eclipse is of interest because deviations from the predictions of a single - period ephemeris could indicate the presence of planetary satellites or additional planetary companions ( brown et al .",
    "2001 , miralda - escud 2002 ) .",
    "in particular , terrestrial planets that induce a radial - velocity perturbation below current detection limits can nonetheless be detected through accurate eclipse timing ( holman & murray 2005 , agol et al .",
    "we searched for evidence of timing anomalies as follows .",
    "we constructed a model transit light curve for each of the 4 bandpasses [ @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath34 ] , based on the optimal parameters appearing in table  2 and the appropriate limb darkening coefficient (   3 ) .",
    "for each of the 6 extinction - corrected , normalized light curves ( identified by an index @xmath104 ) , we then evaluated the @xmath68 of the fit as a function of assumed time of center of eclipse , @xmath105 . after we identified the optimal value for @xmath105 , we assigned uncertainties by identifying the timing offsets at which the value of @xmath68 had increased by 1 .",
    "we list these values in table  3 , and plot the `` observed minus calculated '' ( @xmath106 ) residuals in figure  4 .",
    "the typical timing precision is 2  minutes , which is comparable to results from other ground - based photometry ( for a tabulation of @xmath106 for other transiting - planet systems , see charbonneau et al .",
    "2005 for tres-1 , and wittenmyer et al .",
    "2005 for hd  209458 ) .",
    "we find no evidence for deviations from the predictions of a constant orbital period .",
    "we encourage future monitoring of the times of eclipse of this system .",
    "in particular , space - based observations ( brown et al .",
    "2001 ) should achieve a substantial improvement in timing precision , and thus permit a more sensitive search for perturbing planets .",
    "due to its favorable apparent brightness , the hd  149026 system will be particularly amenable to a variety of follow - up studies .",
    "such pursuits will be more observationally challenging than was the case for hd  209458 , owing to the smaller size of the planet relative to the parent star .",
    "nonetheless , we are certain that such challenges will be met and overcome .",
    "now that a handful of transiting planets of bright stars have been identified , the long - sought - after goal of comparative exoplanetology may be realized .",
