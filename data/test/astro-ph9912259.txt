    "it has long been recognized that highly luminous ( @xmath0  erg  s@xmath1 ) x - ray sources in the cores of globular clusters are grossly overrepresented with respect to the general galactic population ( katz 1975 ; clark 1975 ) : clusters contain @xmath2 of the galaxy s mass , but @xmath3 of the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) sources .",
    "a variety of lines of evidence tell us that these objects are neutron stars in very close binary systems , but the precise mechanisms which enhance their formation in clusters , and protect them from disruption thereafter , are obscure . essentially all of the bright cluster sources are also x - ray bursters , frequently emitting @xmath4 in just a few seconds .",
    "close binaries also have a profound effect on cluster dynamics : just a few such objects in a cluster have a store of orbital kinetic energy which can equal or exceed the orbital energy of all @xmath5 single cluster stars .",
    "thus the study of these rare and odd objects also has important macroscopic implications for the dynamical evolution of clusters ( elson et al .",
    "1987 , hut et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "considerable recent progress in the understanding of the intense bursting x - ray sources in globular cluster cores is in large part due to _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) identifications and follow - on studies of optical / uv counterparts , and to the realization that at least two of the cluster sources are exotic , ultra - short period double - degenerate binary systems : @xmath6 min for x1820303 in ngc6624 ( stella et al . 1987 ; anderson et al . 1997 ) and @xmath7 min for x1850087 in ngc6712 ( homer et al .",
    "1996 ) . the optical / uv studies with _ hst _ have in one sense proven highly successful : a plausible optical counterpart has been identified and/or studied in detail in each of the clusters carefully scrutinized thus far .",
    "however , the diversity in properties of the six counterparts now identified is enormous , with optical luminosities ranging from @xmath8=6 to @xmath8=1 , and confirmed binary orbital periods ranging from 11  min to 17  hr .    the only optical counterpart candidate",
    "thus far for x1832330 in ngc6652 was advanced by deutsch et al .",
    "( 1998b ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the object , denoted star 49 , exhibits a uv excess in the _ hst _ data similar to other known lmxb optical counterparts , and similar absolute magnitude to the optical counterpart of the lmxb in ngc1851 .",
    "however , the region surveyed in paper i does not completely cover the _ rosat _ x - ray error circle derived in that work , and the images are not very deep .",
    "furthermore , the position of star 49 is discrepant at the @xmath9 level with the x - ray coordinates . for these reasons",
    ", paper i suggests that while star  49 is the best candidate for the optical counterpart , its identification remains tentative .",
    "since the initial search for the optical counterpart and discovery of star 49 in paper i , additional wfpc2 observations have become available in the _ hubble data archive_. here we discuss three orbits of f555w ( v ) and f814w ( i ) imaging data obtained on 1997 september 5 , as well as one orbit of f555w , f439w ( b ) , and f218w imaging data obtained on 1995 september 13 . in the former observation ,",
    "seventeen @xmath1020  s f555w and f814w exposures were taken on the first orbit , twelve 160  s f555w exposures on the second orbit , and twelve 160  s f814w exposures on the third .",
    "for the latter observation , fine lock was not achieved and the stellar images are elongated , the cluster is miscentered on the ccds , and the f218w exposures failed completely .",
    "the retake data for this failed observation were successful , and are discussed in paper i , but did not include the proposed optical counterpart .",
    "the early , poor quality data , however , do actually include star 49 , are usable , and will be briefly discussed here as they were overlooked in paper  i. all these data were acquired during unrelated programs to study the cluster ngc6652 itself .    despite the suboptimal sampling of the wfpc2 _ wide field _",
    "ccds , on which the optical counterpart falls in these observations , the cluster is sufficiently sparse and star 49 sufficiently unblended that aperture photometry is entirely adequate to measure magnitudes for this object and a set of nearby comparison stars .",
    "aperture corrections are taken from table 2(a ) in holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995b ) .",
    "the photometric measurements have not been corrected for geometric distortions , nor is any correction for charge transfer efficiency losses ( holtzman et al .",
    "1995b ) applied ; for most of the images , these effects should contribute errors of only a few percent .",
    "we use the photometric zero points for the stmag system from table 9 ( @xmath11 ) in holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995a ) .",
    "systematic errors for all magnitudes due to uncertainties in detector performance and absolute calibration are @xmath105% .",
    "five nearby reference stars also photometered show no variability to the limit of the derived uncertainties ; three of the five are of comparable brightness of star 49 . for star 49 itself",
    ", variability is suggested in the 1995 epoch observations , and large amplitude variability is clearly evident in the 1997 epoch observations .",
    "this large - amplitude variability , when coupled with the uv excess demonstrated in paper i , lends considerable confidence that this object is the correct identification of the optical counterpart to x1832330 .    from the three orbits of f555w and f814w observations , we find @xmath12 and @xmath13 . to create a single light curve of all the data , we subtract 0.4 mag from @xmath14 to create approximately filter - independent magnitudes .",
    "this result is searched for periodic components using algorithms described in horne & baliunas ( 1986 ) .    in fig .",
    "1a we show the fourier transform with the clean algorithm ( roberts et al .",
    "1987 ) applied to remove the effects of the window function .",
    "we find the strong peak seen at @xmath15  min to have 99.5% significance , based on the original ( i.e. prior to cleaning ) periodogram , using methods in horne & baliunas ( 1986 ) . in fig .",
    "1b we show the entire light curve ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) for the three orbit observation .",
    "uncertainty bars are provided for each datapoint , although they are sometimes smaller than the symbols themselves .",
    "a non - linear least squares fitting algorithm is used to determine the best fit sinusoid , which is overplotted on the light curve .",
    "the result is a best - fit period @xmath18  min , semi - amplitude @xmath19  mag , and mean magnitude @xmath20 .",
    "the sinusoid does describe the broad trends in the data quite well , but clearly a large amount of aperiodic flickering is also evident . in fig .",
    "1c we show the light curve averaged into 10 phase bins .",
    "photometric uncertainties are smaller than the symbols .",
    "a few points deviate significantly from the sinusoid fit , most likely due to the strong flickering and small amount of data .    during 1998",
    "november 2830 , we obtained @xmath21  ks of x - ray observation on x1832330 with _ rossi x - ray timing explorer_. the data are processed through the standard _",
    "ftools _ package to obtain a calibrated light curve .",
    "two type i x - ray burst events are evident , confirming the bursting nature of this source first reported by in t zand et al .",
    "( 1998 ) with _ bepposax _ observations .",
    "after background subtraction , we measure a persistent countrate @xmath22 s@xmath1 , which is @xmath23  mcrab , similar to fluxes reported previously for this object .",
    "a search of the background - subtracted light curve reveals no significant periodicities , except for some power at half the _ rxte _ orbital period , apparently induced by the calculated background model .",
    "in particular , there does not appear to be any significant power at the 43.6  min optical period .",
    "the rms scatter in the x - ray light curve is consistent with poisson noise ; we find no evidence for flickering , which might be expected based on our optical observations .",
    "however , as the x - ray and optical observations were made over a year apart , no firm conclusions can be drawn from the lack of x - ray flickering .",
    "a further analysis of the light curve , spectra , and bursts in these x - ray data will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "mukai & smale ( 2000 ) present an x - ray observation of x1832330 from a 1996 _ asca _ observation .",
    "they also find no periodic x - ray modulation , but they do provide evidence for x - ray variability with a similar timescale as the flickering seen in our optical light curve .",
    "the peak in the periodogram of the optical data has 99.5% significance , indicating that it is quite improbable that uncorrelated , gaussian noise would randomly generate such a strong periodic signal .",
    "however , the evident scatter in the photometry is not due to measurement uncertainties , but rather an inherent flickering in the source , and this behavior is likely to produce significantly correlated `` noise '' .",
    "thus the formal significance calculation for the periodicity may overestimate the actual confidence .    our derived period is close to , but statistically different from , half the _ hst _ orbital period .",
    "two further tests increase our confidence that this behavior is not an artifact of the _ hst _ orbit .",
    "as noted in  2.1 , several stars near to and of similar magnitude to star  49 have been measured from the same data , and show no variability at this or other periods .",
    "we have also randomized the association of observation times versus magnitudes for star  49 and rereduced the data . although periods due to incomplete removal of the window function should then remain , as the observing times are identical in these randomized data and in the original observations , the resulting periodograms show no significant power at 43  min .",
    "we find that only @xmath24 of 10000 trials show a peak at any frequency as high as the 43  min one .",
    "although the marked variability we report here adds confidence to the identification of star  49 with the x - ray source , the mediocre agreement of the x - ray position with the object still leaves some uncertainty .",
    "this issue will almost surely be settled by a scheduled observation by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , which should yield a highly accurate position .",
    "however , if we accept that our observed optical variations in star  49 are indeed periodic , there are few alternatives to identifying this object as a lmxb , given its measured characteristics , irrespective of the issues of the x - ray position .",
    "the most extreme sx  phe stars , for example , have periods less than 1  hr , but do not display the marked flickering we observe , so stellar pulsation seems implausible .",
    "if the period is instead orbital , the flickering implies a mass - transfer system .",
    "however , no classical cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are known with periods less than 1  hr , and although cvs share the colors and flickering of star  49 , they are typically 34  mag less luminous than our object in any case .",
    "the he - rich am  cvn stars have the appropriate colors , flickering and period range , but are thought to have @xmath25 ( warner 1995 ) , so would be @xmath26 fainter than star  49 .",
    "thus , given the measured period , luminosity , colors , and flickering of this object , one would likely conclude it is an lmxb even without knowledge of the fact that there is indeed a bright x - ray source observed in the region .",
    "we summarize a variety of parameters for all of the globular cluster lmxb sources and their host clusters in table 1 .",
    "cluster data are primarily compiled from djorgovski ( 1993 ) and other references in the same volume .",
    "column 8 lists @xmath27 values , which we derive by taking a mean of the _ rxte _ asm flux measurements since 1996 , and applying a simple correction to convert approximately to @xmath28jy . in column 9 , we apply the distance correction and give an approximate x - ray luminosity in @xmath29 erg s@xmath1 for the 210 kev asm band .",
    "the absolute calibration is only an estimate and should be treated with caution , but the relative values are likely reliable .",
    "finally , in column 10 we list @xmath30 , the parameter used by van paradijs & mcclintock ( 1995 ) to characterize the ratio of x - ray to optical flux .    that the optical luminosity should depend upon the x - ray luminosity and the size of the accretion disk has been quantified by van paradijs & mcclintock ( 1994 ; hereafter vpm94 ) .",
    "they define the parameter @xmath31 and find a strong correlation , such that m@xmath32 . in fig .",
    "[ periodrel ] we show a similar figure as in vpm94 , but we use m@xmath33 instead of m@xmath34 , which is likely to be reasonable as vpm94 find an average @xmath35 for field lmxbs .",
    "the data for globular cluster lmxbs are derived here and from deutsch et al .",
    "( 1998a ) , and are plotted with large diamonds , approximately indicating the entire known range of optical and x - ray luminosity .",
    "the solid line indicates the best fit to all lmxbs by vpm94 .",
    "the dotted lines denote the apparent full range of possible values ( using vpm94 s best fit slope ) . for ngc1851",
    ", no orbital period is known , but the optical and x - ray luminosities are measured .",
    "we therefore draw a dashed line which is likely to encompass the probable range of orbital periods , @xmath36 hr , where the lower bound is taken to be the shortest orbital period known and the upper value is the maximum period implied by our dotted line bounds .",
    "we thus predict that the orbital period of x0512401 will prove to be less than 1 hr . based on model accretion disks , deutsch et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also infer that x0512401 must have orbital period less than one hour .    as listed in table 1 , an eclipse period of 12.4  hr",
    "was recently reported by in t zand et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the lmxb in the globular cluster terzan 6 .",
    "using behavior exhibited by the gc lmxb sources in fig .  2 , we can now infer that the optical counterpart of that source ( for which there has not yet been a search ) will have @xmath37 . the high inclination ( @xmath38 )",
    "inferred from the eclipse behavior by in t zand et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggests that the luminosity may well be at the fainter end of the above range , and thus similar to the optical counterpart in ngc6441 .",
    "however , the high reddening to terzan  6 will making discovery of the optical counterpart by conventional means ( _ hst _ observations of uv - excess ) extremely difficult ( deutsch et al",
    ". 1998b ) .",
    "a search for eclipses with infrared imaging of the x - ray error circle may be the easiest method of isolating the optical / ir counterpart of this source .",
    "the ultraviolet - excess candidate for the optical counterpart of the intense x - ray source in ngc6652 suggested by deutsch et al .",
    "( 1998b ) is found to be highly photometrically variable .",
    "although the data are of limited length , the evidence is strong that a significant component of the variability is periodic , with @xmath39  min , most likely the orbital period of the system . regardless of whether or not the variability is periodic , the marked amplitude of the variations significantly strengthens the case for the identification of the object with the bursting x - ray source . somewhat tempering this conclusion is the poor positional agreement of the object with the only extant x - ray data ,",
    "although _ chandra x - ray observatory _ observations will almost surely settle this issue .",
    "the lack of similar x - ray variability is inconclusive .",
    "star 49 is clearly unusual regardless of its association with the x - ray source , but the probability of two such unrelated objects falling within a few arcseconds of each other is presumably modest , so we favor the identification of the star and the x - ray burster , pending the _ chandra _ data .",
    "we examine a homogeneous set of _ hst _ data on globular cluster x - ray source counterparts , including star 49 in ngc6652 , and find that they fit well with the correlation of optical luminosity , x - ray luminosity , and accretion disk size previously discussed by vpm94 .",
    "even if the 43  min period is not confirmed , the orbital period of x1832330 must still be less than @xmath40  hr if it is to follow the relation of this diagram . using a somewhat different argument ,",
    "mukai & smale ( 2000 ) also infer that x1832330 in ngc6652 is a short period system .",
    "the correlation in this diagram also strongly implies that the x - ray source in ngc1851 must have orbital period @xmath41  hr as well .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by deutsch et al .",
    "( 2000 ) via an independent argument , through examination of the spectral energy distribution of that object .",
    "thus four of the seven central globular cluster x - ray sources where orbital periods are constrained or known are inferred to be ultracompact , a fraction considerably in excess of that for field low mass x - ray binaries ; only @xmath42% of field lmxbs with known periods have @xmath41  hr in the compilation of van paradijs ( 1995 ) .",
    "in fact , if ultracompact systems in gc lmxbs were as rare as in the field , then the binomial probability that at least four out of seven systems are by chance found to be ultracompact is only @xmath43 .",
    "one can readily imagine multiple explanations for this significant overabundance of compact systems , although the unique dynamic environment of cluster cores is certainly a most tempting factor to invoke .",
    "it is not clear whether the same explanation applies even to all members of this small sample ( the double - degenerate systems in ngc6624 and ngc6712 may be unique ) , or that observational selection may be at work .",
