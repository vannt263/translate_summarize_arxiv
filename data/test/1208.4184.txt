    "electron transfer is of fundamental importance to proteins whose functionality relies on redox reactions with other proteins , cofactors , or the external environment . in proteins containing heme groups , a single fe ion in a protoporphyrin ring changes valence state between ferrous ( fe@xmath0 ) and ferric ( fe@xmath1 ) oxidation states as an electron is accepted by or donated to the protein  @xcite .",
    "much experimental work has been performed to develop an understanding of protein electron transfer mechanisms @xcite most of it based on statistical averages of protein ensembles measured by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques @xcite .",
    "electron transfer through individual molecules has been probed recently using electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy ( ec - stm ) @xcite . in ec - stm ,",
    "a gate voltage is used to align a molecule s redox level to the fermi levels of the tip and substrate with the sample in solution at room temperature .",
    "the results are explained using resonant tunneling @xcite and two - step electron transfer models @xcite . according to resonant tunneling models , electrons transfer via resonant tunneling due to alignment of molecular orbital energy levels with the fermi level of the contact electrodes . in the two - step process ,",
    "conformational changes in the molecule occur during tunneling which change the orbital energy levels .",
    "this process is thought to be especially prevalent in redox molecules @xcite . in a related group of experiments ,",
    "measurements on large assemblies of localized proteins using mercury contacts have been used to distinguish between tunneling and hopping electron transfer mechanisms @xcite .",
    "nanometer - gap electrodes fabricated by electromigration techniques @xcite have made it possible to study electron conductance through small single redox molecules . by applying a bias voltage @xmath2 between electrodes and a gate voltage @xmath3 to the sample s substrate , molecular energy levels can be probed and characteristic single - electron transistor ( set ) behavior , such as a coulomb blockade or a kondo resonance , can be observed  @xcite . in particular , these experiments have demonstrated that molecular junctions fabricated in this way can be used to probe the electron transfer properties of the molecules . in these measurements ,",
    "the presence of coulomb blockade phenomena by itself is not proof that the molecular properties are being probed because the characteristics of the junction itself after the breaking process can affect the measurements  @xcite , and therefore control experiments must be performed to validate the data .",
    "these measurements , if performed correctly , rely on a resonant tunneling process which in principle indicate that tunneling is a possible electron transfer mechanism .",
    "our aim in this work is to determine whether tunneling is a viable electron transfer mechanism in redox proteins such as myoglobin by attempting to fabricate and measure single electron transistors .",
    "here we describe the study of single - electron transistors composed of the protein myoglobin ( mb ) .",
    "mb is a roughly spherical globular metalloprotein containing a heme group surrounded by a folded single - chain polypeptide consisting of 153 amino acids ( apomyoglobin ) @xcite .",
    "mb was chosen because 1 ) it is relatively small ( @xmath4 ) , which is desirable to increase electron tunneling probability , 2 ) the apo form is readily available and well studied and can thus be used as a control to discern effects related to the heme group , and 3 ) its structure and vibrational spectra are well known .",
    "in other words , mb is a model system with which to test bioelectronic devices based on heme - containing proteins .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after briefly discussing the general properties of myoglobin and single - electron transistors in the _ background _ section , we describe the experimental techniques used , including break junction fabrication , electrical measurements , and protein incorporation . in the _ results _ section we describe results from bare junctions , junctions with apomyoglobin ( apomb ) , and junctions with mb . in the _ discussion _",
    "section we analyze our data using the known properties of myoglobin and the results from the bare and apomb samples . because set conductance can result from metal grains produced by the electromigration process  @xcite , an important distinction between samples with and without protein incorporation is the observation of inelastic tunneling from discrete vibrational modes  @xcite .",
    "we also identify heme - group resonant tunneling by comparing the behaviors of apomb samples with mb samples .",

    "the si substrate served as the gate contact .",
    "the widths of junctions were usually between 100  nm and 300  nm .",
    "the junctions were fabricated by electron - beam lithography using a lift - off technique .",
    "pt films , 20 nm thick , were deposited on a si / sio@xmath5 substrate by magnetron sputtering with approximately a @xmath7 deposition angle with respect to the surface normal of the sample .",
    "the samples were rotated about the surface normal during deposition .",
    "the pt deposition rate was 0.028 nm / s and the base pressure was @xmath8  torr ; an ar pressure of 1.5 mtorr was used during deposition .",
    "the junction thickness at its narrowest point was approximately 8  nm to 10  nm because of a shadow effect during the sputtering deposition process , as shown in figure  [ fig : junctions](a ) .",

    "after the cleaning procedure , the protein solution was dropped on the samples .",
    "the samples were kept at 4  @xmath13c in order to let water evaporate .",
    "a drop of the solution was placed on the unbroken junction prior to cooling down the samples .",
    "linker molecules were avoided because junctions exposed to them ( without protein ) generated resonant tunneling electronic data .",
    "these data showed a weak dependence on gate voltage , which would have made it difficult to disntiguish the protein behavior from that of the linker ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "raman spectra showed that the mb was active after cooling down to @xmath14  k and then warming up to room temperature  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the protein denatured during the cooling process .",
    "another possible problem is that the local temperature during the electromigration process might be high enough to denature the protein @xcite .",
    "measurements of the electrical resistance at low voltages as a function of temperature yielded an estimate of a maximum temperature of approximately 400  k , which is consistent with estimates of 495 k for junctions broken at room temperature  @xcite .",

    "in the control experiments with bare junctions ( without protein ) , 107 pt junctions were broken by electromigration at @xmath17  k. the broken junctions had a resistance ranging from 1  m@xmath6 to 1  g@xmath6 .",

    "these islands have several energy levels and the conductance peaks from metal grains can be tuned by gate voltage modulation .",
    "many coulomb diamonds were observed , each corresponding to the addition of an electron to the island .",

    "figure  [ fig : apomyodata](c ) shows how the peak height depended on temperature .",
    "the monotonic decrease of the peak height with increasing temperature , together with saturation at low temperatures ( @xmath24 ) indicates that tunneling , and not mott hopping , is the dominant electron conduction mechanism in this device  @xcite .",
    "tunneling is observed because the conductance is smaller than the conductance quantum of @xmath25  s. the lack of dependence of @xmath3 means , however , that the separation of energy levels inside the protein are much larger than @xmath26  @xcite .",

    "when the junction was initially broken by a negative electrical pulse , no conductance peaks were found .",
    "however , there was a sudden increase in the current when the voltage was increased again , indicating a modification of the contact and possible protein incorporation in the gap of electrodes  @xcite , although this could also be due to joule heating resulting from a sudden narrowing of the junction in the bowtie region  @xcite .",
    "conductance peaks were observed thereafter . in the differential conductance map , shown in figure  [ fig : myo1data](a ) ,",

    ", two deformed coulomb blockade triangles near zero bias voltage can be found without a degeneracy point in the differential conductance graph .",
    "this means that two charge states do not have the same energy , and in this case the separation between the top triangles is @xmath52 mv .",
    "this separation , as shown by the calculation in figure  [ fig : calculations](c ) , is an indication that the two - step electron transfer process is a viable mechanism .",
    "in addition , there are three areas that exhibit negative differential conductance ( ndc ) , indicated by the three blue arrows .",

    "this suggests that these measurements were the result of transport through two or more myoglobin proteins in series with each other .",

    "these orbitals split further by 0.25  ev to 0.37  mev due to molecular orbital interactions  @xcite , which is difficult to detect even at a cryogenic temperature of @xmath61  k. excited states are also difficult to probe because of low @xmath2 ( @xmath62  mv ) used in the measurements ( higher voltages destroyed our samples ) .",

    "a mb set can be modeled as a single energy level device with inelastic tunneling processes possible due to the localized vibrational modes of the heme group . however , it is known that redox reactions can cause significant conformational changes of the heme group  @xcite and that the associated relaxation time could range from picoseconds to seconds  @xcite .",
    "if the relaxation time is long , the electron resonantly tunnels while the protein remains in the intermediate state and its degeneracy point is at @xmath2 = 0 .",
    "if the relaxation time is short ( on the order of a few ps ) , the protein quickly relaxes from the intermediate state to its ground state , whose level may fall below the fermi level of electrodes , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : calculations](a ) . in this case , the electron is trapped in the protein , current flow is blocked , and the coulomb blockade lacks a degeneracy point .",
    "this is further illustrated by the calculations in figures  [ fig : calculations](b ) and [ fig : calculations](c ) performed by solving tunneling rate equations  @xcite ( see _ appendix a _ ) .",

    "it is important to note that amino acids around the heme group may complicate the analysis by acting as intermediaries for electron hopping processes and redox centers  @xcite .",
    "these aromatic amino acids have low frequency vibrational modes , such as phenylalanine ( 124 mev ) , tyrosine ( 79.9 mev , 103 mev , and 106 mev ) , and tryptophan ( 94.2 mev , 109 mev and 125 mev )  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental question in analyzing our results is determining whether the protein is indeed being measured .",
    "regarding the results of the bare junctions with respect to the mb junctions , we notice that the conductivity maps in figures [ fig : myo1data ] and [ fig : myo2data ] do not show multiple degeneracy point like those of the bare junctions in figure [ fig : blanks](d ) , and the energy scale ( gate and bias voltages ) used are completely different .",
    "this is an indication that the myoglobin data come from the protein and not from metallic islands formed in the junctions .",
    "we note that a similar observation has been made for break junctions used to measure single opv-5 molecules , where gold grains remaining in the junction create multiple coulomb diamonds which are superimposed on the signal from the molecule  @xcite . as to whether the heme group plays a role in resonant tunneling processes ,",
    "we note that none of the apomb samples conductance showed a strong dependence on gate voltage , while only mb samples had this dependence .",
    "another indication that the data represent the conductance of the protein are the inelastic tunneling features of the conductance plots in figures  [ fig : myo1data ] and [ fig : myo2data ] . as mentioned above",
    ", these features correspond to the known vibrational energies of the heme group .",
    "the effects of the protein orientation can be surmised from inelastic vibrational spectra .",
    "two pathways for electron transfer between the heme iron and electrodes are through the porphyrin ring or the his93 group  @xcite .",
    "transfer through the porphyrin ring occurs as a result of porphyrin ring s @xmath74-orbital hybridization with the @xmath63-orbital of iron  @xcite combined with a slow porphyrin - iron structural relaxation  @xcite . in this case , the resonant energy level does not change during tunneling , and results like those in figures [ fig : calculations](b ) and [ fig : myo2data](a ) are expected . on the other hand , the dip near @xmath75 and @xmath76  v in fig .",
    "[ fig : myo2data](b ) could be due to the very fast relaxation (  ps ) of the fe - his bond  @xcite .",
    "the qualitative difference between figures  [ fig : myo1data](a ) and [ fig : myo2data](a ) could be due to different orientations of the heme group with respect to the electrodes . moreover , because the heme group is not at the center of the protein  @xcite , certain orientations may cause the heme to be closer to the electrodes , thus increasing the probability of observing kondo resonances .",
    "another complication is that the large lateral size of the break junctions could result in several proteins with different conformations being measured in parallel , or in protein dimers consisting of two proteins measured in series if the gap is somewhat larger than a single protein .",
    "we assume that conductance is dominated by the narrowest portions of the break junction since tunneling processes usually depend exponentially on the effective width of the barriers , and therefore it is unlikely that trimers or larger protein agglomerations will play much of a role in the conductance data .",
    "the data shown in figure [ fig : myo2data](a ) agree well with what is expected from a single protein conductance , whereas the data in figure  [ fig : myo2data](b ) show indications of multiple protein conductance ( either in series or in parallel ) , in addition to a two - step tunneling process . analyzing the data with more sophisticated models that take into account multiple protein conductance may be helpful in further understanding the conductance mechanism , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have presented results from a series of experiments on metallic break junctions with apomyoglobin and myoglobin .",
    "some myoglobin junctions displayed single - electron transistor behavior consistent with resonant tunneling through the heme group .",
    "in one case , tunneling appears to be a result of a two - step process where the protein changes conformation during the tunneling process .",
    "elastic and intelastic tunneling data are also consistent with resonant tunneling from known vibrational modes of the protein .",
    "our results underscore the importance of tunneling , as opposed to hopping , as an electron transfer mechanism in redox proteins .",
    "future challenges include determining the spin state of a single metalloprotein via a set configuration for sensor applications and using other metalloproteins , such as cytochrome p450 , that have binding properties to specific molecules .",
    "this will require a greater yield of successful devices and control of the protein orientation and conformation on the electrodes .",

    "we therefore set up the rate equations for two - step electron transfer by making the following assumptions :    1 .   when the electron tunnels into the protein , the energy level 0 relaxes to level 1 via a structural distortion in a time @xmath97 .",
    "the process is not reversible and fluctuations between levels 1 and 0 resulting from nuclear distortions are neglected .",
