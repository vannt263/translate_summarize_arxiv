    "in the last years , research on exciton - polariton condensates in semiconductor microcavities has initiated a quest for novel technological applications , which could set the basis for a new generation of devices in the next decades .",
    "different groups have reported on the usefulness of polaritons to realize new lasers ,  @xcite and there is a strong focus on the development of elements for optical information processing , including : switches ,  @xcite transistors ,  @xcite diodes ,  @xcite amplifiers ,  @xcite and integrated circuits .",
    "@xcite    this research effort is motivated by the fusion of photon and exciton properties that appear in exciton - polariton systems , giving rise to a fast ( picosecond scale ) response time , a long ( nanosecond scale ) dephasing time  @xcite and strong nonlinearities .",
    "different fundamental properties of out - of - equilibrium polariton bose - einstein condensates have been profusely investigated , including coherence ,  @xcite robust propagation of polariton wave trains ,  @xcite frictionless flow ,  @xcite persistent quantized superfluid rotation ,  @xcite and solitary waves .",
    "@xcite these phenomena , together with the capability of polariton condensates to couple to external light sources , form an ideal basis for the construction of optical information processing devices .    however , the development of optical information processing is heavily dependent on integrability with existing ( i.e. , electrical ) technologies , which may well require designs using incoherent or non - resonant carrier injection methods . for this reason we focus on non - resonantly excited polariton condensates , in contrast to previous studies aimed at developing functional logical switches based on polaritons .",
    "@xcite in our previous work  @xcite we have found that repulsive interactions between polaritons and hot excitons in the system , which are inevitably excited with a non - resonant scheme , allow the acceleration of polariton condensates . this is consistent with earlier experiments by wertz , et al .",
    ",  @xcite and measurements under continuous wave excitation .",
    "@xcite in this work , we introduce a time - dependent control of propagating polariton condensates using optically - induced tuneable repulsive potential barriers .",
    "these barriers block propagation , causing reflection of an incident polariton condensate wave train .",
    "the presence of multiple barriers allows multiple reflections and the re - routing of the wave train into a confinement region . unlike previous works on the gating of polariton condensates , the confined polaritons are still propagating and in excited states .",
    "considering the signal represented by propagating polariton condensates , we also demonstrate the ability of the system to function as an _ and _ type logic gate .",
    "when the propagating condensate is strongly confined , the energy - relaxation present in the system causes the formation of a long - living coherent ground - state . taking this as the output state , its formation requires both the initial injection beam and the presence of the optically - induced barrier .",
    "our approach using only non - resonant excitation anticipates the implementation of new ultrafast , non - linear switches based on the electrical injection of polariton condensates .",
    "the sample used in the experiments is a high - quality @xmath0 algaas - based microcavity containing 12 embedded quantum wells , giving a rabi splitting of @xmath1 mev ( further information about this sample is given in ref . ) .",
    "reactive ion etching has been applied to sculpt ridges with dimensions @xmath2m@xmath3 .",
    "we select a region on the sample where the detuning between the bare exciton ( @xmath4 ) and bare cavity mode ( @xmath5 ) in the ridge corresponds to resonance , i.e. @xmath6 0 .",
    "we keep the sample at 10 k in a cold - finger cryostat and excite it with 2 ps - long light pulses from a ti : al@xmath7o@xmath8 laser , tuned to the bare exciton energy level ( 1.545 ev ) .",
    "two independent , twin beams , dubbed _ a _ and _ b _ , are split from the laser : their intensities , spatial positions and relative time delay ( @xmath9 ) can be independently adjusted .",
    "we have determined that the power threshold to produce polariton condensates is @xmath10 mw .",
    "the two laser beams used in the experiments are focused on the sample through a high numerical - aperture ( 0.6 ) lens , to form 10-@xmath11  @xmath12 m spots .",
    "the same lens is used to collect and direct the emission towards a 0.5 m spectrometer coupled to a streak camera , working in synchroscan mode , obtaining energy- , time- and space - resolved images , with resolutions of 0.4 mev , 10 ps and 1  @xmath12 m , respectively .",
    "every picture is the result of an average over millions of shots ( laser repetition rate 82 mhz and integration time 1.1 s ) .",
    "the photoluminescence can be simultaneously resolved in the near- as well as in the far - field .",
    "the momentum space is simply accessed by imaging the fourier plane of the lens used to collect the emission , taking advantage of the direct relation between the angle of emission and the in - plane momentum of polaritons .",

    "the insets in panels ( b ) and ( c ) compare the dispersion relation quantization of polaritons at low energies .",
    "the dashed arrow indicates the energy of the excitation laser .",
    "the intensity is coded in a linear , normalized , false color scale . ]    in order to give a comprehensive characterization of the sample , we present now the dispersion relations of polaritons in relevant , different ridge s regions used in the experiments , obtained under non - resonant ( 1.612 ev ) , weak excitation conditions ( @xmath1320 @xmath12w ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : disp_rel ] ( a ) shows a scanning electron microscopy image of the 20-@xmath12 m wide ridge .",
    "two rectangles centered at @xmath14 0 and 90  @xmath12 m mark the spatial regions from where the real - space emission was collected in order to obtain the corresponding dispersion relations .",

    "since the dispersion relation is obtained at the right ridge s border , only states in the dispersive branches with negative @xmath18 are occupied by left propagating polaritons .",
    "to achieve the _ and _ gating operation of the device a proper choice of ( i ) the _ a _ and _ b _ beam locations , ( ii ) their power and ( iii ) the delay , @xmath19 , between them must be made . concerning the power , for the experiments described in this subsection we have used @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which are appropriate to obtain the _ and _ response of the device .",

    "the pulses create polariton condensates at their impinging positions , which spread out over time . after a time delay ,",

    "the introduction of dynamic , fully controllable potential barriers allows the reflecting and re - routing of the wave trains .",
    "multiple reflections occurring between pairs of barriers ( optical induced or formed by the wire edge ) allow the confinement and storage of propagating polariton states .",
    "this localization also gives rise to an enhancement of energy relaxation into a coherent ground - state , which forms a convenient output of a logical _ and _ gate .",
