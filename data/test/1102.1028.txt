    "after the effect of spin transfer torque ( stt ) in thin magnetic films had been predicted  @xcite and then experimentally proven  @xcite , it was generally believed that current - controlled spin valve devices would replace soon the memory cells operated by external magnetic field .",
    "such a technological progress , if realized , would certainly offer higher data storage density and faster manipulation with the information stored on a hard drive memory . however , it became clear soon that some important issues must be solved before devices based on spin torque could be used in practice .",
    "the most important is the reduction of current density needed for magnetic excitation ( switching ) in thin films , as well as enhancement of switching efficiency and thermal stability .",
    "some progress has been made by using more complex spin valve structures and/or various subtle switching schemes based on optimized current and field pulses  @xcite .",
    "a significant enhancement of thermal stability can be achieved by replacing a simple free layer ( single homogeneous layer ) with a system of two magnetic films separated by a thin nonmagnetic spacer , known as composite free layer ( cfl ) .",
    "the spacer layer is usually thin so there is a strong rkky exchange coupling between magnetic layers  @xcite . in practice",
    ", antiferromagnetic configuration is preferred as it reduces the overall magnetic moment of the cfl structure and makes the system less vulnerable to external magnetic fields and thermal agitation . when the antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic layers are identical , we call the structure synthetic antiferromagnet ( syaf ) . if they are different , then the cfl has uncompensated magnetic moment and such a system will be referred to as synthetic ferrimagnet ( syf ) .",
    "current and/or field induced dynamics of cfls is currently a subject of both experimental and theoretical investigations  @xcite .",
    "switching scheme of syaf by magnetic field pulses has been proposed in ref .",
    "[ ] , and then the possibility of current - induced switching of syaf was demonstrated experimentally  @xcite . in turn , the possibility of critical current reduction has been shown for a cfl with ferromagnetically coupled magnetic layers  @xcite .",
    "however , the reduction of critical current in the case of antiferromagnetically coupled cfls still remains an open problem . in a recent numerical study on switching a syaf free layer  @xcite it has been shown that the corresponding critical current in most cases is higher than the current required for switching of a simple free layer , and only in a narrow range of relevant parameters ( exchange coupling , layer thickness , etc . ) the critical current is reduced .",
    "hence , proper understanding of current - induced dynamics of cfls is highly required .",
    "we also note , that cfl can be used as a polarizer , too .",
    "indeed , it has been shown recently  @xcite that syaf used as a reference layer ( with magnetic moment fixed fixed to adjacent antiferromangentic layer due to exchange anisotropy ) might be excited due to dynamical coupling  @xcite with a simple sensing layer  @xcite .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to study current - induced dynamics of a cfl with antiferomagnetic rkky coupling in metallic spin valve pillars .",
    "we consider a system @xmath0/@xmath1/@xmath2/@xmath3/@xmath4/@xmath5 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , where @xmath0 is an antiferromagnetic layer ( used to bias magnetization of the reference magnetic layer @xmath1 ) , @xmath3 and @xmath5 are two magnetic layers , while @xmath2 and @xmath4 are non - magnetic spacers .",
    "the part @xmath3/@xmath4/@xmath5 constitutes the cfl structure with antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling .",
    "we examine current - induced dynamics of both syaf and syf free layers .",
    "these two structures differ only in the thickness of @xmath3 layer , while rkky coupling and other pillar parameters remain the same .",
    "we assume that spin - dependent electron transport is diffusive in nature , and employ the model described in refs .",
    "[ ] and  [ ] . an important advantage of this model is the fact that it enables calculating spin current components and spin accumulation consistently in all magnetic and nonmagnetic layers , as well as current - induced torques exerted on all magnetic components .",
    "the torques acting at the internal interfaces of cfl introduce additional dynamical coupling between the corresponding magnetic layers .",
    "consequently , the magnetic dynamics of cfl has been modelled by two coupled macrospins and described in terms of landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation .",
    "in addition , we derive some analytical expressions for critical currents from the stability conditions of linearized llg equation in the static points  @xcite , and discuss results in the context of numerical simulations .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the assumed models for spin dynamics and stt calculations . in section",
    "3 we analyze stt acting on cfl and present results from numerical simulations on current - induced switching and magnetic dynamics . some additional information on stt calculation can be found in the appendix .",

    "finally , summary and general conclusions are in section  5 .",

    "the damping parameter @xmath12 and the saturation magnetization @xmath13 are assumed the same for both magnetic components of the cfl .",

    "similarly , @xmath26 describes the magnetostatic influence of the layers @xmath1 and @xmath27 on the layer @xmath17 , respectively . here , @xmath28 is the saturation magnetization of the layer @xmath29 , which might be generally different from @xmath13 .",
    "components of the tensors @xmath25 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 used in our simulations have been determined by the numerical method introduced by newell _",
    "et al . _",
    "this method was originally developed for magnetic systems with non - uniform magnetization . to implement it into a macrospin model we considered discretized magnetic layers with uniform magnetizations , calculated tensors in each cell of the layer , and then averaged them along the whole layer .",
    "since these tensors are diagonal , the demagnetization and magnetostatic fields can be expressed as @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 denoting the components of the vector @xmath8 ( @xmath37 ) in the coordinate system shown in fig.1 .",
    "finally , @xmath38 stands for the rkky exchange field acting on @xmath8 , which is related to the rkky coupling constant as @xmath39  @xcite .    to include thermal effects",
    "we add to the effective field  ( [ eq : heff ] ) a stochastic thermal field @xmath40 .",

    "in this section we present results on our numerical simulations of current - induced dynamics for two metallic pillar structures including cfl with antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling .",

    "the layer py(8 ) is the permalloy polarizing layer with its magnetization fixed due to exchange coupling to irmn .",

    "the other factor giving rise to the the difference in switching from @xmath119 to @xmath117 and from @xmath117 to @xmath119 follows from the fact that the magnetostatic interaction of the cfl s layers with the polarizer is different in the @xmath117 and @xmath119 states . to prove this we have constructed analogical hysteresis loops for syaf and syf free layers disregarding magnetostatic interaction with the @xmath1 layer ; see figs .",
