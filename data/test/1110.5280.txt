    "complex networks have been the focus of the study of dynamical properties of complex systems in nature and society in the last decade @xcite . usually all nodes are assumed to belong to one population or class , and the interactions between two distinct populations have been reported just recently @xcite .",
    "the dynamical properties of two interacting populations , extroverts and introverts were recently studied using dynamical network evolution model @xcite .",
    "buldyrev et al @xcite developed a framework for understanding the robustness of interacting networks .",
    "using the generating functions method they present the exact analytical solutions for the critical fraction of nodes , which upon removal , will lead to a complete fragmentation into interdependent networks .",
    "the focus of the current approach in understanding the formation and evolution of terrorist networks is on middle - range perspective as opposed to the micro - level approach that considers individual terrorist and macro - level analysis of the root causes of terrorism @xcite . in particular , the interest is in placing the relationships between individuals in the context of ( i ) their interactions with each other , ( ii ) how they are influenced by ideas originating from their environment , ( iii ) their interactions with people and organizations outside of their group @xcite . motivated by this description which conceptually refers to a complex system and because networks provide a fruitful framework to model complex systems @xcite , we introduce a network model that aims to describe the interactions between potentially terrorist and non - terrorist populations .",
    "our goal is to present a model of a social network that contains two types of agents which demonstrate different affinities in establishing connections within their own population versus connections with the other population .",
    "we also aim that the model is simple enough to allow the derivation of approximate analytical expressions of the basic characteristics of the network .",
    "the latter can be achieved in the general framework of rate equation theory in the mean field approximation which has been introduced to study fundamental characteristics of growing network models @xcite . within this framework",
    "we introduce the rate equations that are specific to our model , solve them and obtain analytical expressions that predict the growth dynamics of the degree of individual vertices .    , the initial contact @xmath2 and the secondary contact @xmath3 .",

    "( e)-(h ) show the connections when the new node is a @xmath0 node .",
    "empty symbols ( @xmath4 ) mark an @xmath1 node while full symbols ( @xmath5 ) mark a @xmath0 node .",
    "full lines represent links between nodes of the same type , e.g. friends , such as @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "dashed lines represent links between nodes of different types such as @xmath8 , e.g. enemies . ]    while the probability to create initial connections is easily defined , the probability for the secondary contacts between nodes is difficult to derive because of the interactions between the two types of nodes .",
    "as a first approximation , we assume that the initial and secondary contacts form edges with the same probabilities .",
    "to include a more precise contribution of both the initial and the secondary contacts in the rate equations we empirically obtain their functional dependences .",
    "this leads to an improved agreement between analytical and numerical simulation results .    from the functional dependence of the degree of a node as a function of time using the mean - field arguments",
    ", we derive the degree distribution for each of the two types of nodes .",
    "we also derive analytical expressions of the structural , three - point correlations between nodes to study the clustering properties of the networks .",
    "the network models are broadly classified into two categories : the network evolution models in which addition of new edges depends on the local structure of the network , and nodal attribute models in which the existence of edges is determined solely by the attributes of the nodes ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "the network evolution models can be further categorized into growing network evolution models and dynamical network evolution models . in the former",
    "the network growth starts with a small seed network and nodes and links are added according to specific rules until the network reaches a predetermined size .",
    "dynamical network evolution models start with an empty network and edges are added and deleted according to specific rules until statistical properties of the network stabilize .    in this paper , we propose a model that incorporates a growing network evolution process with nodal attributes which could be thought of as a new class of model .",
    "the model has five free parameters , three describing the growing network evolution process and two describing nodal attributes .",
    "the parameters of the growing network evolution process are the number of nodes @xmath9 , the average number of nodes selected at random as initial contacts @xmath10 , and the average number of nodes selected as secondary contacts @xmath11 among the neighbors of each initial contact @xcite .",
    "two parameters quantify the type and amount of nodes , non - violent @xmath1 or potentially violent @xmath0 nodes and the type of interactions between them which are as follows : ( i ) nodes are randomly marked as non - violent @xmath1 with probability @xmath12 and potentially violent @xmath0 with probability @xmath13 ; ( ii ) when establishing initial contacts , nodes connect with probability @xmath14 if the nodes are of the same type , such as @xmath0 with @xmath0 or @xmath1 with @xmath1 , or with probability @xmath15 if the nodes are of different types such as @xmath1 with @xmath0 nodes .",
    "the secondary contacts are established with nodes among the neighbors of the initial contacts .",
    "the model combines the random attachment of initial contacts with the implicit preferential attachment of the secondary contacts . in that",
    ", the model represents a generalization with two types of node attributes of growing models such as @xcite .",
    "the definition of establishing edges can be thought of as creating links between friends ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) or between enemies ( dashed lines ) . by varying the value of @xmath14",
    ", we can generate different strengths of friendliness or animosity .",
    "the possible configurations of triads that arise in social networks in such a context are : ( a ) three friendly interactions ; ( b ) one friendly and two unfriendly connections ; ( c ) two friendly interactions and one unfriendly ; ( d ) three unfriendly interactions @xcite . according to the strong formulation of structural balance theory in social sciences , configurations ( a ) and ( b ) are considered stable while ( c ) and ( d ) are unstable and likely to break apart @xcite . in their empirical large - scale verification of the long - standing structural balance theory",
    ", the authors of @xcite find that the unstable triads , especially formation ( c ) are extremely underrepresented in an online social system in comparison to a null model .",
    "our model produces correctly the stable configurations ( a ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , e ) and ( b ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b - d , f - h ) but can not produce the unstable configurations ( c ) and ( d ) in accordance with the strong formulation of the structural balance theory @xcite .",
    "the model algorithm consists of the following steps : ( 1 ) start with a seed network of @xmath16 connected nodes among which some are @xmath1 and some are @xmath0 , depending on @xmath12 ; ( 2 ) at each time step add a new node , which has probability @xmath12 to be a non - violent and @xmath13 to be a violent node ; ( 3 ) select on average @xmath17 random nodes as initial contacts . the probability to connect the same type of nodes is @xmath14 while @xmath15 is the probability for initial contacts if they are of different types .",
    "( 4 ) select on average @xmath18 nodes among the neighbors of each initial contact as secondary contacts .",
    "connecting the new node with the secondary contacts is done without checking if it is the same type of node or not .",
    "there are two reasons for this choice .",
    "( i ) because the probability to establish inter - population connections ( @xmath14 ) is higher than the probability to connect nodes intra - population ( @xmath19 ) , it is more likely that the first contact and its neighbors ( potential secondary contacts ) are of the same type than of different types .",
    "therefore the secondary contacts will be more likely to be intra - population contacts even without explicitly modifying their probability to connect based on the type .",
    "( ii ) the secondary contacts are meant to mimic the ` friend - of - a - friend ' type of contacts in the real world , and we think that the implicit preferences given by the existing network connections would more accurately describe the nature of such contacts without including an explicit separate probability",
    ". apply steps ( 2 ) to ( 4 ) until the network reaches the necessary size .",
    "we start with constructing the rate equations that describe the change of the degree of a node on average during one time step of the network growth process for each of the non - violent @xmath1 and violent @xmath0 nodes .",
    "the degree of a node grows via two processes .",
    "one is the random attachment of connecting a new node to @xmath10 nodes that are its initial contacts .",
    "the second process is when the new node is further connected to the @xmath11 nodes among the neighbors of the initial contacts . in the following",
    "we assume that the probability of this second process is linear with respect to the degree of the node which leads to implicit preferential attachment .",
    "the rate equations are : @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the degree of node @xmath3 and we assumed that @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "all possible combinations of triads of a new node @xmath25 , the initial contact @xmath2 , and the secondary contact @xmath3 are schematically shown in fig .",

    "( [ v ] ) for an @xmath1 and @xmath0 node , respectively .",
    "for example , the fifth term in eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) describes the rate of change of the degree of vertex @xmath3 ( which is an @xmath1 node ) due to establishing the configuration of contacts shown in fig .",
    "the fifth term contains four factors .",
    "the first factor is the average number of secondary contacts which is @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the probability that the new node created at time step @xmath28 is a @xmath0 node .",
    "@xmath14 is the probability that the newly created node connects to the initial contact which is a node of the same type .",
    "finally , @xmath29 is the probability that the node selected for initial contact ( node @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) shares an edge with the node @xmath3 .",
    "this is a standard expression for preferential attachment except for the complications induced by having two distinct populations .",
    "the nominator @xmath30 is the degree of the @xmath3 node if we count only the links to different types of nodes ( in this case @xmath0 nodes ) .",
    "the denominator is the sum of all possible links which the type of node selected for initial contact ( in this case @xmath0 ) could have . assuming that the initial and secondary contacts are created with the same probabilities the nominator would be equal to @xmath24 and we will approximate it in this way and the denominator would be equal to @xmath31 .",
    "we will use this expression as a first approximation and we will also empirically derive functional dependences of the denominator and compare the results .",
    "note that the number of edges , multiplied by two , that exist between @xmath1 and @xmath1 nodes is equal to @xmath32 and include both edges created as initial contacts and edges created as secondary contacts .",
    "the same is true for the number of edges between @xmath0 and @xmath0 nodes which is @xmath33 , and the number of edges between @xmath1 and @xmath0 nodes which is @xmath34 in eqs .",
