    "the possibility of oscillation in a plasma due to local separation of charges and the consequent restoring forces was discussed by j. d. jackson long time ago .",
    "@xcite the theory is based on a neutral plasma , which has both positively ( ion ) and negatively ( electron ) charged components . for a charged particle beam in an accelerator , although it is not neutral in terms of charges , there is still density fluctuation due to the graininess of the individual particles  in our case , the individual electrons .",
    "such graininess is usually smoothed out in the fluid model and ignored in most computations . in a highly intensive beam , however , it may introduce the `` plasma - like '' oscillation ( for convenience , `` plasma oscillation '' is used hereafter ) . as of today",
    ", people have concluded that the plasma effect is not significant at high energies  @xcite and the physical model has already been implemented into the successful particle tracking codes such as elegant .",
    "@xcite meanwhile , the work of great importance has been done for analyzing the plasma oscillation in a thermal electron beam in 3-d ,  @xcite and the full - dimensional analytical study of the microbunching instability developed in the space without acceleration for a longitudinally quasilaminar beam also reaches a very good agreement with the simulation results .",
    "@xcite in spite of that , a general method is still needed to connect the plasma effect to the gain of the instability no matter whether acceleration exists and independent of lattice components . moreover , at low energies that the quasilaminar approximation does not hold very well , the discussions for the development process of the microbunching instability ( @xmath0bi ) are still not so adequate and need more efforts to reveal more detail . on the other hand , although a particle - in - cell ( pic ) code like impact - t  @xcite is able to emulate the evolution of the beam accurately at low energies , an analytical way comparable to the well - developed method to compute the gain of the microbunching instability  @xcite is also desired to perform a quick estimate for the instability .",
    "the discussion in this article is in a free space without any boundary .",
    "we start our discussion in the 6-d phase space by employing vlasov and poisson ( gauss ) equations which describe the evolution of the distribution function of the electron bunch and the electric field induced by the charge distribution .",
    "we then use a method similar to jackson s  @xcite to linearize the vlasov equation with 1-d approximation and obtain the solution of the initial - value problem .",
    "the solution includes the contributions from both the perturbed and unperturbed parts of the initial distribution , with the contribution from the velocity distribution included . in section",
    "iii , the electric field due to the density perturbation is derived by combining the solution of the initial - value problem and the poisson equation  @xcite together . in section",
    "iv , we carry out the investigation by employing the klimontovich distribution that describes the exact phase space location of each individual particle as the initial perturbation .",
    "we find that the evolution of the perturbed electric field is subject to periodic oscillation and landau damping at low energies . in the last section , the damping factor as a function of modulation wavelength , beam energy and uncorrelated velocity spread for a longitudinally cold beam",
    "is illustrated , and the amplitudes of the energy modulation driven by the lsc impedance with and without the plasma effect included are computed for a typical linac lattice starting from the exit of the electron gun and ending before the compression .",
    "the results show that the difference between the energy modulations calculated by the different methods develops rapidly at low energies and becomes very large before the bunch compressor , and leads to the noticeable change to the gain of the instability .",
    "the energy modulation and the final gain are also computed as the functions of critical variables such as modulation wavelength and charge density .",

    ", our analysis shows that the plasma effect is rather trivial , which is consistent with the regular theory .",
    "however , the overall effect is non - trivial because the influence of the plasma effect developed at low energies exists all the way to the end .",
    "at last , it should be pointed out that there is another way to solve the problem .",
    "it begins with to solve for the growth directly from vlasov equation and poisson equation , because the imaginary part of the eign - frequency will give the growth rate .",

    "<S> starting from the vlasov and poisson equations in the multiple - dimensional phase space , we perform the straightforward analysis of the microbunching instability based on the explicit formula of the longitudinal electric field introduced by the density perturbation in the longitudinal direction , in such a way to be highly comparable to the well - developed method for higher energy beams . </S>",
    "<S> this method generally applies in both the cases with and without acceleration and independent of lattice components . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that for a electron beam with small transverse emittance at low energies , which is always the case in the injector of a free electron laser device , the plasma effect results in the oscillation of the longitudinal electric field in the modified plasma frequency that depends on the transverse size of the beam , and the landau damping effect in the longitudinal electric field due to the uncorrelated longitudinal velocity spread during the beam transportation . </S>",
    "<S> these two effects both play important roles in the development of the instability . as the result , </S>",
    "<S> the energy modulation driven by the lsc impedance differs from the regular value significantly and the discrepancy leads to the noticeable change of the final gain of the instability . </S>"
