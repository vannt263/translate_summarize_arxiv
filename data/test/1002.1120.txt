    "while string theory has had remarkable successes over the last several years , accelerated by the revolutions in understanding its non  perturbative properties , it is still very much the case that we do not yet know what the theory is .",
    "we can not state unambiguously what the basic degrees of freedom are ( it is highly context dependent in a way that depends upon the dynamics themselves ) , and even the backgrounds in which the theory propagates are themselves open to interpretation .",
    "for example , in some descriptions and situations , the theory contains gravity , and in others , it does not . from some perspectives there",
    "are open strings present , and from others , only closed .",
    "ironically , several of these frustrating ( from the point of view of finding simple definitions ) features are also among the theory s most powerful positive traits , allow an ever  widening range of applications of the theory to diverse problems , often of a strongly coupled nature .    while applications continue , it is still important to try to get to grips with what the theory is . at the very least ,",
    "this is important from a pragmatic standpoint , since perhaps a useful definition or characterization of string theory might be put to use as , for example , a diagnostic device in identifying when a physical problem may have some aspect of it that is amenable to solution by string theory methods .",
    "more generally , if string theory ultimately plays some fundamental role in the understanding of physics beyond the standard model , and/or in cosmology and other origins questions about the universe at large , a more profound understanding of the nature , power , and scope of the theory would seem to be highly desirable .    at best , to date , as a result of various dualities , we know that it is probably part of some larger physical framework which itself is only string theoretic in various corners of its parameter space .",
    "this physical setting , called m  theory , remains profoundly mysterious well over a decade after the first clear glimpses of it@xcite .",
    "historically , problems pertaining to such essential matters of understanding in physics are greatly illuminated by having a rich set of examples that are simple , but yet complex enough to contain all the important phenomena in question . for the problems outlined above",
    ", it would be rather excellent to have the simplest possible string theories that still contain some of the marvellous non - perturbative physics we know and love , and be able to follow them as they connect to each other in ways that are entirely invisible in perturbation theory .",
    "further icing on the cake would be to have the physics all captured in terms of relatively familiar structures for which there is an existing technology for its study .",
    "this is the subject of this paper ( and a follow  up to appear later@xcite ) , at least in part .",
    "the simplest known strings with tractable non  perturbative physics that contain a rich set of phenomena ( such as holography and open  closed dualities ) are the minimal strings@xcite , and in particular ( where non  perturbative physics is concerned ) the type  0 strings ( formulated in refs.@xcite and refs.@xcite , and recognized as type  0 strings in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the non  perturbative formulation of the type 0a and type 0b strings can be done rather beautifully in terms of certain integrable systems , as we will review later : type 0a has the korteweg  de vries system while type 0b has zakharov  shabat .",
    "the non  perturbative physics of each is formulated in terms of associated non ",
    "linear ordinary differential equations often called `` string equations '' . while much of the language of the two is similar , these are very different systems , and except for various accidental ( from the perspective of those separate formulations ) perturbative coincidences ( and a non  trivial non  perturbative equivalence for one model  see later ) , the physics of each are quite separate indeed .",
    "this paper builds on all of these results , taking them much further .",
    "we have found that there is a larger framework into which the type 0a and type 0b string theories can be naturally embedded and within which they are connected as parts of a larger theory . we found further that the two string theories are merely special points in a much larger tapestry of possibilities . when perturbation theory is examined , other special points suggest themselves , and they turn out to be just as `` stringy '' as the original type  0 theories , deserving to be thought of as string theories as well .",
    "we begin the program of trying to identify some of these theories , with some success .",
    "we also find that the larger framework provides natural definitions of regimes of the type  0 string theories that are hard to define using perturbation theory , and we will report more fully on non  perturbative aspects in a follow ",
    "up paper@xcite .    in this sense",
    ", we have a precise analogue of m  theory .",
    "we have a larger physical framework that is not itself a string theory , but that can be readily specialized to yield string theories as special limits .",
    "we can move between different theories in a quite natural way , which is nonetheless outside the framework of any of its daughter string theories .",
    "we find this encouraging and exciting .    at the base of our infinite family of string equations , organizing much of this remarkable structure ,",
    "is a non  linear differential equation known as painlev  iv .",
    "this well  known equation from the classical mathematics literature , part of a celebrated family of six equations , has two arbitrary constants , usually denoted @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "( actually , two copies of painlev iv turn up in our story , intertwined in an interesting way . )",
    "it turns out that the type 0a and 0b points in the tapestry of theories occur at the vanishing of one or other of these constants for one of the copies of painlev  iv .",
    "the vanishing of the constants of the second painlev iv hint at interesting new special points .",
    "after reviewing crucial aspects of the type  0a and  0b string theories in section  [ sec : type0 ] , we unpack the dispersive water wave hierarchy and present the infinite family of equations we propose as the string equations in section  [ sec : dww ] .",
    "section  [ sec : painleve ] highlights the role of painlev  iv . in section",
    "[ sec : connectab ] we show how the structures of section  [ sec : type0 ] arise as special points in this larger framework , while section  [ sec : beyond ] is a detailed study of the rich properties of the string equations and the types of solutions available .",
    "we organize and classify a great deal of the physics that appears , and notice in section  [ sec : square ] that much of the physics can be organized in terms of a square .",
    "the square is reminiscent of the main square organizing the moduli space of @xmath9 ( two  dimensional ) string theories , discovered in ref.@xcite , and we contemplate a possible connection , perhaps induced by renormalization group flow@xcite to the @xmath0 context of the work in question .",
    "the possible relation between the squares helps us make a conjecture about the nature of two new special points we find : they might be type  iia and  iib minimal string theories .",
    "( note that these are type  ii theories in the sense of the structure of the gso projection used to formulate them .",
    "there is no spacetime supersymmetry@xcite . ) in section  [ sec : new ] we carry out a comparison of the new structures we found to some continuum computations for one  loop partition functions . from this",
    "we strengthen aspects of our type  ii suggestion .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] with a brief summary and discussion .",
    "we will start with a brief review of the type  0 string theories coupled to the @xmath10 superconformal minimal models and show how these theories can be elegantly described within the framework of an integrable hierarchy of partial differential equations ( pdes ) accompanied by an hierarchy of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .",
    "these models exhibit novel and interesting physics , all of which and more will be seen to be embedded in the dww system that we will describe in the next section .",
    "this review will help establish our notation and the framework upon which we can readily build the more general structure .",
    "we begin with the following ordinary differential equation ( known in the old days as a `` string equation '' ) @xmath11 this equation ( or , really , family of equations ) and its properties have been studied in several papers .",
    "it was first derived and studied as a fully non  perturbative definition of a string theory in refs.@xcite , and evidence that it defines a type  0a string theory was presented first in ref@xcite .",

    "this non  perturbative connection between the 0a and 0b theories ( for @xmath70 ) follows , mathematically , from the fact that the same basic string equation appears at the base of the two separate ( kdv _ vs _ zs ) hierarchies of equations .",

    "as outlined around equation  ( [ kdvflow ] ) , string equations can be thought of as supplying the initial conditions for the partition function , and then the pdes of flows describe how the partition function evolves as a function of the operators that couple to the @xmath159@xcite .",

    "is that this is the first time that a role for this equation has been uncovered in this context of non  perturbative string theory , and it takes its place alongside the painlev  i and  ii equations whose roles ( mentioned earlier ) have been established in this context already .",
    "in fact , part of the motivation that led to the discoveries upon which we report here was the question as to the further role of the painlev equations in such systems .",

    "the string equations for this case were already written in equations  ( [ dwwn=1 ] ) .",
    "solving the first of these for @xmath162 gave equation  ( [ dwwn=1v ] ) , and substituting into the second yields a scalar second order ode in @xmath242 ( equivalent to painlev  iv ) , which can be used to produce the expansions .",
    "asymptotic expansions for @xmath242 can then be used to yield asymptotic expansions for @xmath50 using equation  ( [ dwwn=1v ] ) .",
    "we obtain three classes of expansions for @xmath50 , @xmath243    upon integrating twice ( following what we learned from the type  0 theories in sections  [ sec:0a ] and  [ sec:0b ] ) , one can obtain the free energy for a genus expansion of a string theory which allows us to identify the string coupling to be @xmath244 .",
    "the other expansions within each class can be obtained by the following symmetry operation : @xmath245 since @xmath246 and @xmath247 contain only even powers of @xmath15 , the are invariant under this map ; however , @xmath248 .",
    "thus there are two expansions in the @xmath249 class , and , together with @xmath246 and @xmath247 , these comprise four total @xmath177 expansions .",

    "so in this case both @xmath15 and  @xmath269 should appear with even powers .",
    "+ in applying these observations to our dww expansions , we immediately notice the remarkable fact that the various expansions have powers of the parameters which somehow allow for interpretations as counting branes or fluxes .",

    "we consider the possibility that the theories @xmath379 and @xmath380 are type  iia and type  iib string theories , respectively .",
    "as we will see , this will uniquely fix the normalizations and allow us to identify the resulting @xmath381 as that of case  ( 5 ) above , _",
    "i.e. _ type  ii string theories coupled to the @xmath374 @xmath2 models .      pursuing the apparent similarity with the moduli space of @xmath382 theories@xcite a little further , ( recall our discussion in section  [ sec : square ] , and",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] ) we can study the partition functions of those theories ( compactified on a circle ) to get clues as to the possible relative normalizations .",
    "we list them here@xcite : @xmath383 an important clue is to be found in the @xmath384 behaviour of each theory .",
    "this is the physics of the field theory sector ( kaluza  klein states ) that propagate on the circle , and the relative normalizations are of interest to us .",
    "type  0b has twice as much energy in this sector as type  0a , and type  iia has double that of type  iib .",
    "now , as expected , the type  0 theories exchange under the t ",
    "duality operation @xmath385 , as do the type  ii theories .",
    "duality vertically should take the type  ii theories to the type  0 theories , but this needs to be done on a circle twisted by @xmath386 .",
    "the partition functions for iia / b on such a circle is : @xmath387 notice that the field theory term of type  iia is now actually half that of type  iib .",
    "now we can compare the overall type  ii normalization to the type  0 by doing the vertical t  duality .",
    "under @xmath385 we see that type  iib field theory term matches that of the type  0a theory , while for type  iia , the field theory term is 1/4 that of the type  0b value .    in summary , we see that comparing squares would suggest that @xmath388 and @xmath389 , and the chain of relationships above gives the relative normalization of 0b and 0a as 2 to 1 , while that of ( twisted ) iib and iia is 2 to 1 , so @xmath390 .",
    "finally , t  duality ( with a twist ) between 0a and iib gives them the same relative normalization , implying , @xmath391 in this case we get therefore that for our putative type  ii theories , @xmath392 which is equal to that of the type  0 case , but with an opposite sign .",
    "this is the same as the partition function  ( [ pfnsadminstypeii1 ] ) for the type  ii theories coupled to the @xmath374 @xmath2 super  minimal models .",
    "interestingly , equation  ( [ gammaad ] ) implies that @xmath393 for iib and @xmath278 for iia , which nicely mirrors the values @xmath394 for 0a and @xmath57 for 0b .",
    "further work is required to strengthen our conjecture that we have here the type  iia and  iib theories coupled to the superconformal minimal models . as stated , an explicit definition of @xmath0 type  ii strings ( separately for types  a and  b , and not just our suggestion for @xmath316 given in section  [ sec :",
    "type - ii - z - even ] ) does not yet seem to exist in the literature , and our attempts to directly define them so far are incomplete .",
    "note that we have assumed that the relative normalizations of the partition functions that follow from @xmath382 really descend to the @xmath0 case , and while reasonable , this needs to be proven .",
    "the explicit @xmath25 dependence of the individual partition functions that we get by taking the dww one  loop expressions seriously have a ( so far ) unilluminating form at positive @xmath125 that we have not been able to check against a continuum computation .",
    "on the other hand the negative @xmath125 result neatly mirrors the type  0 case .",
    "we list the results here , and leave this line of investigation for the future and @xmath395 theories are again type  0a and type  0b string theories , respectively , perhaps coupled to an @xmath2 modular invariant .",
    "this would again fix the relative normalization of the partition functions such that @xmath396 and @xmath397 , yielding @xmath398 , which unfortunately differs from the continuum partition function for the @xmath367 @xmath2 super  minimal models by a sign . to match",
    ", we would have to assume that @xmath399 encodes the partition function instead of @xmath326 , which contradicts our earlier establishment of the @xmath1 type  0 points . ] : @xmath400 this should be compared with the type  0 cases displayed in equation  ( [ pfns0a0b ] ) .",
    "our main successes so far have involved theories in which @xmath340 and the values for @xmath15 and @xmath174 have been independent of @xmath84 . while these are the simplest possibilities , there is little reason to suspect that these theories are the only types amenable to description by dww .",
    "we observed in section  [ sec : unknown - tilde ] that there might be new theories , _",
    "e.g. , _ the ones we called @xmath401 and  @xmath402 , whose description will most likely require such @xmath84dependence for @xmath403 .",
    "unfortunately , the availability of continuum calculations to compare to is limited , so obtaining convincing evidence for any particular proposal is difficult .",
    "nevertheless , there is much more evidence to accumulate from the differential equations themselves .",
    "we hope to report upon this issue in later work .",
    "we briefly mention one way that @xmath84dependence might emerge naturally .",
    "the @xmath316 that we have constructed from the torus terms of our perturbation expansions depend on three variables : @xmath84 , @xmath174 , and @xmath15 .",
    "we must however impose sign independence which reduces the total number of independent variables describing @xmath340 to two .",
    "in special cases the algebra conspires and we find that @xmath316 actually depends on no variables at all . this behavior is to be compared to @xmath316 as computed from the continuum partition functions . for generic @xmath356 and @xmath78",
    ", @xmath316 is a function of two variables , but in special cases this dependence completely vanishes .",
    "this motivates us to attempt to express for @xmath84 , @xmath174 , and @xmath15 as functions of @xmath356 and @xmath78 .",
    "equation  ( [ z0a0b ] ) indicates that @xmath404 is inversely proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "the form of equation  ( [ pfnaamins2 ] ) then suggests that we take @xmath405 . since @xmath406 in this case",
    ", we can predict @xmath407 now equating @xmath404 of equation  ( [ z0a0b ] ) with the quantity in equation  ( [ pfnaamins2 ] ) and using the relation @xmath408 , which follows from sign independence , gives @xmath409 note that the models already studied had @xmath350 which gave us @xmath57 .",
    "we can perform the same exercise for @xmath410 which we have argued describes type ii strings coupled to @xmath2 @xmath374 models .",
    "again we have @xmath411 , which holds for @xmath359 and @xmath412 . equating @xmath413 of equation  ( [ relncgammaad ] ) with the quantity in equation  ( [ pfnsadminstypeii1 ] ) and using @xmath414 gives , @xmath415 for the models we ve previously considered , @xmath359 ,",
    "so we correctly reduce to the condition @xmath278 .",
    "note here that we would run into problems if we considered @xmath416 because then @xmath174 would become imaginary .",
    "as discussed at length in the introduction , we find very significant this rich framework into which we can embed so many string theories and discover how they intertwine with each other .",
    "we suspect that there may be many more theories to be found in this framework , and that we have only just begun to learn how to extract and identify the various theories using the limited comparisons we can do to existing continuum computations .",
    "we have been able to gather evidence for a square of connected theories , firmly establishing the top corners as type  0a and  0b theories coupled to the @xmath1 modular invariant @xmath10 minimal models , and finding several strong pieces of evidence that the special points at the bottom are string theories , the ( non  supersymmetric@xcite ) type  iia and  iib theories coupled to the @xmath2 modular invariant @xmath374 minimal models .",
    "see figure  [ square2 ] .",
    "notice that the @xmath249 side of the square is generically understood as defining the theory when the number background branes , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath174 or @xmath15 , is set to zero .",
    "this is the case for type  0b ( already established in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and is inherited by the type  iia theory as well . away from @xmath278 @xmath249 is complex for @xmath25 even , and one of the symmetry breaking @xmath417 may supply the @xmath102 physics instead .",
    "( for @xmath25 odd , @xmath249 is real for @xmath418 and so may well furnish the @xmath102 physics in those cases . )",
    "it is also important to note that for @xmath25 odd , @xmath247 is no longer real ( with the exception of @xmath278 at @xmath70 ) .",
    "this suggests that this regime of perturbation theory at @xmath101 ( containing fluxes for type  iia and branes for type  iib ) is ill  defined at those values of @xmath25 , even while the opposite regime at @xmath102 exists .",
    "this may suggest non  perturbative instabilities for those values of @xmath25 .",
    "an instructive prototype of this possibility is the original bosonic family of string theories defined non  perturbatively in terms of a painlev  i hierarchy of string equations@xcite . at large @xmath125 ,",
    "the leading behaviour for the two point function was @xmath419 for the @xmath25th model , and for positive @xmath125 the physics was the @xmath161 conformal minimal models coupled to liouville theory . for even @xmath25 ,",
    "the the @xmath102 regime gives complex values , signalling the non  perturbative problems .",
    "something analogous may be going on here for odd @xmath25 ( except @xmath70 , @xmath278 ) for the type  ii @xmath2 @xmath374 models .",
    "we will report further non  perturbative aspects in a follow  up paper where we discuss numerical and analytic studies of solutions that connect different perturbative regimes@xcite .",
    "+    there are many more interesting issues to understand . while we compared to our proposal for a continuum definition of the even sector partition function of the type  ii theories , a direct continuum definition of the type  iia and  iib string theories would be valuable to have , in order to provide another check on our conjecture for the new points .",
    "whether or not they are type  ii string theories , it is clear that these new theories are of interest , and may ( as already stated ) be only the first in a very large family of new theories that our string equations define .",
    "they are all nicely interconnected with the known type  0 theories , and have a rich non  perturbative sector .",
    "we will explore much of this non  perturbative physics in a follow ",
    "up paper@xcite .",
    "we have seen several signs that the organizing square is inherited from the organizing square of theories seen at @xmath382 in ref.@xcite .",
    "we suspect this inheritance arises physically by rg flow , and it would be of value to explore this further ( there are bosonic investigations in the literature@xcite ) . in particular , the special points with @xmath420 , where our partition functions vanish ( also suggested by the underlying painlev  iv structures we saw in section  [ sec : painleve ] , which are also worth understanding better ) , may well be related to the supersymmetric points identified in ref.@xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have found a rich laboratory of solvable string theory models with several non  perturbative connections between them by realizing them as special points of a larger physical system , the theory of dispersive water waves . in some respects",
    "it is an analogue of what we would like to see in studies of m  theory .",

    "<S> we explain how these and several string  like special points arise and are connected . in some cases , the framework endows the theories with a non  perturbative definition for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> notably , we discover that the painlev iv equation plays a key role in organizing the string theory physics , joining its siblings , painlev i and ii , whose roles have previously been identified in this minimal string context .    * string theory and water waves *    * ramakrishnan iyer@xmath3 , clifford v. johnson@xmath4 , jeffrey s. pennington@xmath5 *    _ @xmath6department of physics and astronomy _    _ university of southern california _    _ los angeles , ca 90089 - 0484 , u.s.a . _    _ @xmath5slac national accelerator laboratory _    _ stanford university _    _ stanford , ca 94309 , u.s.a . _    @xmath3ramaiyer , @xmath4johnson1 , [ at ] usc.edu ; @xmath5jpennin [ at ] stanford.edu </S>"
