    "anderson localization theory describes many relevant aspects concerning the nature of one - electron states and collective excitations in random media  @xcite . in one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) electronic systems with time - reversal symmetry , this theory predicts the absence of a disorder - driven metal - insulator transition for any degree of uncorrelated disorder .",
    "recently , however , it has been reported that the presence of short  @xcite or long - range correlations  @xcite in disorder acts towards the appearance of truly delocalized states in 1d anderson models .",
    "this theoretical predictions was put forward to account for transport properties of semiconductor superlattices with intentional short - range correlated disorder  @xcite and microwave transmission spectra of single - mode waveguides with inserted long - range correlated scatters  @xcite .    in 2d , the existence of extended states due to correlations in disorder has been also proved .",
    "thus , in ref .  @xcite the authors considered a two - dimensional striped medium in the @xmath0 plane with on - site correlated disorder .",
    "the on - site energies were generated by a superposition of an uncorrelated term in the @xmath1-direction and a long - range correlated contribution along @xmath2-direction .",
    "it was predicted that this model displays a disorder - driven kosterlitz - thouless metal - insulator transition provided strong correlations in disorder .",
    "more recently , the effect of an isotropic scale - free long - range correlated disorder on the one - electron eigenstates of the 2d anderson model has been studied  @xcite . to introduce long - range correlations in _ both _ @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions , the site energies were chosen to have a power - law spectral density @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the magnitude of the typical wave - vector characterizing the energy landscape roughness .",
    "the metal - insulator transition induced by strong correlations ( @xmath5 ) was monitored by measuring the participation number exponent from the long - time behavior of the wave function spatial distribution  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a uniform electric field applied to a periodic lattice causes the dynamic localization of electron wave packets and gives rise to their oscillatory behavior , the so - called bloch oscillations  @xcite . due to the advances in semiconductor technology , it has become possible to monitor the bloch oscillations in uniform superlattices  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this phenomenon is not restricted to electronic systems .",
    "recently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite reported the first experimental observation of photonic bloch oscillations in two - dimensional periodic systems . in spite of the fact that the periodicity of the potential has been admitted to be the key ingredient for bloch oscillations to exist ,",
    "it has been demonstrated recently that a 1d anderson model with diagonal long - range correlated disorder displays bloch oscillations in the strong correlation limit  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the period of oscillations agrees well with the one in an ideal bloch band , while the amplitude of oscillations is proportional to the width of the delocalized phase , which has been predicted to appear in the strong correlation limit  @xcite .",
    "the spectral counterpart of bloch oscillations wannier - stark quantization of the energy spectrum has been found to be also a remarkable feature of the model  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the interplay between the delocalization effect , arising from the long - range correlated disorder , and the dynamic localization , caused by an electric field acting on the system . by solving numerically the 2d time - dependent schrdinger equation for the complete hamiltonian , we compute the behavior of an initial gaussian wave packet in the presence of a uniform electric field .",
    "we found clear signatures of bloch - like oscillations  @xcite of the wave packet between the two mobility edges of the phase of delocalized states .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillatory motion of the centroid allows us to determine the bandwidth of the delocalized phase .",
    "we consider a 2d electron moving in a random long - range correlated potential on a regular @xmath6 lattice of unitary spacing and subjected to a uniform electric field @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding tight - binding hamiltonian reads  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a wannier state localized at site @xmath10 , @xmath11 is its energy , and @xmath12 is the energetic bias , @xmath13 being the electron charge . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the corresponding cartesian unit vectors .",
    "we will assume that the electric field is applied along the diagonal of the square lattice",
    ". then @xmath16 .",
    "transfer integrals are restricted to nearest - neighbor sites and are given by @xmath17 .",
    "hereafter , we fix the energy scale by setting @xmath18 .",
    "the long - range correlated sequence of site energies @xmath11 are generated by making use of a fourier transform method as follows @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are @xmath23 independent random phases uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 is a normalization constant , such that @xmath26 .",
    "we also shift the on - site energies in order to have @xmath27 .",
    "the wannier amplitudes evolve in time according to the time - dependent schrdinger equation which can be written as  @xcite @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",

    "( [ schrodinger ] ) is solved for the initial condition  ( [ gaussian ] ) , we compute the projection of the mean position of the wave packet ( centroid ) along the field direction @xmath33",
    "in the absence of disorder ( @xmath34 ) , all the states are dynamically localized by the uniform electric field and the centroid oscillates in time , revealing bloch oscillations  @xcite . the amplitude and the period of these oscillations",
    "are estimated from semiclassical arguments ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , where @xmath37 is the width of the bloch band in units of the transfer integral @xmath17 ( @xmath38 in our case ) .",
    "the frequency of the bloch oscillations is given by @xmath39 and , therefore , is equal to the bias magnitude @xmath40 in the chosen units .",
    "to study joint effects of the bias and correlated disorder , we performed numerical simulations of eq .",
    "( [ schrodinger ] ) . in all simulations",
    "square lattices of size @xmath41 were used .",
    "the initial wave packet was considered to be located in the center of the lattice , @xmath42 and its standard deviation was set to @xmath43 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( upper panel ) we plotted the centroid time behavior of a biased wave packet ( @xmath44 ) in a weakly correlated random potential ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "recall that in the absence of bias all the states are localized for such a value of the correlation exponent @xmath46  @xcite . as is seen ,",
    "switching on the bias does not lead to coherent oscillations of the wave packet .",
    "a more detailed inspection of these numerical data shows that bloch oscillations in the weak correlation regime ( @xmath47 ) can be observed only for a short initial transient .",
    "they are strongly damped by disorder and rapidly transformed into an incoherent motion of the centroid presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( upper panel ) . to provide a further confirmation of this claim , we calculated the fourier spectrum @xmath48 of the centroid @xmath49 . figure  [ fig1 ] ( lower panel ) shows the result after averaging over @xmath50 realizations of disorder .",

    "we will show below that these states drastically affect the dynamics of the wave packet , that now resembles the oscillatory motion of the electron in a biased disorder - free lattice . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] we plotted the centroid time behavior of a biased wave packet for two values of the correlation exponent @xmath52 ( fig .",

    "two magnitudes of the bias , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , were considered for each value of @xmath46 .",
    "figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] clearly demonstrate the occurrence of sustainable bloch - like oscillations .",
    "their amplitudes @xmath56 are found to be @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is independent of the applied bias @xmath40 . from the data in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we obtain @xmath59 .",
    "this value agrees remarkably well with the width of the band of extended states reported in ref .",

    "one can see a clear signature of sustainable bloch - like oscillations .",
    "the corresponding fourier spectra of the centroid , obtained by averaging over 50 realizations of disorder , are shown in the right panel.,width=321 ]     but for @xmath62 .",
    "the inset shows the fourier spectrum of the centroid for a single realization , clearly illustrating the fact that the oscillations reveal two dominant frequencies around @xmath63.,width=321 ]    the fourier spectra @xmath48 of the centroid , computed after averaging over @xmath50 realization of disorder , show a single broad peak at about @xmath63 .",
    "the peak frequency nicely agrees with the one in an ideal bloch band . looking , however , at the fourier spectrum of a single realization ( as shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , one notices that actually @xmath48 has two narrow peaks .",
    "the frequency of these peaks fluctuates from one realization to the other , which after averaging results in a broad single - peaked spectral density .",
    "this splitting is not found in 1d long - range correlated potentials .    with",
    "the aim to elucidate the anomalies found , we present a simplified model that sheds light on the origin of this doublet structure in the fourier spectrum of the centroid oscillations . to this end , we recall that the random site potential @xmath64 is given by the sum of harmonic terms  ( [ site_energy ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of each term decreases upon increasing the harmonic number . for sufficiently high values of @xmath46 , the first term in the series",
    "will be dominant , while the others are considerably smaller .",
    "consequently , the site potential for a given realization represents a harmonic function , perturbed by a colored noise ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . based on this observation ,",
    "we keep only the first term in  ( [ site_energy ] ) and neglect all others in our further argumentations .",
    "thus , the `` random '' site potential now is @xmath65 , where phases @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be arbitrarily chosen .",
    "for the two sets of phases @xmath68 and @xmath69 indicated in the plots .",
    "right panels show the corresponding centroid fourier spectra.,width=321 ]    the effective local bias is a superposition of the external one and the gradient of the local potential , @xmath70 . at the initial position , @xmath42",
    ", its components will be given by @xmath71 for @xmath72 , the components of the effective bias are identical . as the frequency of the bloch oscillations is proportional to the magnitude of the effective bias , only a single dominant frequency shall be present in this case .",
    "one just observes this in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( left - upper panel ) .",
    "notice that for the particular case plotted ( @xmath73 ) , the local bias at the central position does not acquire any contribution coming from the harmonic potential , which results in a null shift of the oscillation frequency .",
    "however , for the general case of @xmath74 , the local bias components will differ by an amount on the order of @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , bloch oscillations will have two dominant frequencies . this feature is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( left - lower panel ) where we used @xmath76 and @xmath77 . for this case",
    "@xmath78 at @xmath31 is not influenced by the local potential and the corresponding oscillation frequency is not shifted . on the other hand , the typical frequency associated with oscillations along the @xmath2-direction",
    "is shifted from the bare frequency @xmath79 .",
    "the two peak structure depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( left - lower panel ) and in the inset of fig .  [ fig3 ] ( right - upper panel ) has , therefore , their origin in the distinct contributions given by the gradient of the local potential to the effective local bias .",
    "averaging over random phases @xmath66 and @xmath67 results in a broader fourier spectrum @xmath48 around @xmath79 with a mean width on the order of @xmath75 .",
    "we studied the electron motion on a 2d square lattice with on - site long - range correlated disorder in the presence of an external uniform electric field .",
    "long - range correlations were introduced by using a 2d discrete fourier method which generates an appropriate disorder distribution with spectral density @xmath3 .",
    "solving numerically the schrodinger equation , the time evolution of an initial gaussian wave packet was investigated , aiming to find coherent bloch oscillations .",
    "our results suggest that the oscillations are strongly damped in the weak correlation limit @xmath80 , when all the states are localized because of disorder .",
    "the motion of the wave packet on a large time scale is chaotic in this case .",
    "the sustained oscillations arise for @xmath81 , when a phase of the extended states emerges at the center of the band .",
    "the amplitude of oscillations was found to be proportional to the energy difference between the two mobility edges of the delocalized phase  @xcite , in good agreement with semiclassical arguments .",
    "thus , we arrive at one of the principal conclusions of this work : ( i )  there exist clear signatures of the bloch oscillations of a biased gaussian wave packet in the strong correlation regime ( @xmath81 ) , originated from the presence of the two mobility edges , and ( ii )  the oscillations exhibit two dominant frequencies because the local bias has a contribution from the site energy potential .",
    "this is understood using semiclassical arguments .",
    "the richness of the predicted dynamical behavior can lead to new electro - optical devices , based on the coherent motion of confined electrons .",
