    "in spite of great progress , one of the missing links in our understanding of grbs is a knowledge of the luminosity function and the rate of grbs .",
    "the realization that grb are beamed raised the question of what is the angular distribution .",
    "the discovery of energy - angle relation ( frail et al .",
    ", 2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) suggested that the luminosity function and the angular distributions should be also related .",
    "the number of grbs with an observed afterglow is still rather limited .",
    "redshift has been measured only for a fraction of these bursts and the selection effects that arise in this sample are not clear .",
    "therefore , at present we can not derive directly the grb luminosity function . a possible method to derive the luminosity function",
    "makes use of a luminosity indicator .",
    "several such indicators have been suggested ( norris , marani & bonnell 2000 ; fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ) but the robustness of those indicators is not yet clear . in a recent paper schmidt ( 2003 )",
    "shows that a luminosity function obtained using luminosity indicators fits the observations very poorly .",
    "an alternative is to consider the observed peak flux distribution and fit possible luminosity functions and burst rate distributions ( piran 1992 , cohen & piran 1995 , fenimore & bloom 1995 , loredo & wasserman 1995 , horack & hakkila 1997 , loredo & wasserman 1998 , piran 1999 , schmidt 1999 , schmidt 2001 , sethi & bhargavi 2001 ) this can be done by obtaining a best fit for the whole distribution or simply by just fitting the lowest moment , namely , @xmath11 .",
    "evidence of jetted grbs arises from long term radio observations ( waxman , kulkarni & frail 1998 ) and from observations of achromatic breaks in the afterglow light curves ( rhoads 1997 , sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) .",
    "however the structure of these jets is still an open question .",
    "the two leading models are ( 1 ) the uniform jet model , where the energy per solid angle , @xmath12 , is roughly constant within some finite opening angle , @xmath13 , and sharply drops outside of @xmath13 , and ( 2 ) the universal structured jet ( usj ) model ( rossi , lazzati & rees 2002 ) , where all grb jets are intrinsically identical , and @xmath12 drops as the inverse square of angle from the jet axis . within the uniform jet model , the observed break corresponds to the jet opening angle .",
    "frail et al . ( 2001 ) and panaitescu and kumar ( 2001 ) have estimated the opening angles @xmath13 for several grbs with known redshifts .",
    "they find that the total gamma - ray energy release , when corrected for beaming as inferred from the afterglow light curves , is clustered .",
    "a recent analysis ( bloom , frail & kulkarni , 2003 ) on a larger sample confirmed this clustering around @xmath14ergs . within the usj model the jet break corresponds to the viewing angle and",
    "the energy - angle relation given above implies that the luminosity distribution within the jet is proportional to @xmath15 ( rossi , lazzati & rees 2002 ) and therefore the luminosity function has the form @xmath16 ( perna , sari & frail 2003 ) .",
    "frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also derive the observed @xmath13 distribution . taking into account the fact that for every observed burst there are @xmath17 that are not observed they derived the true @xmath13 distribution and used it to estimate the average `` beaming factor '' , @xmath18 .",
    "then they multiply this factor times the local ( isotropic estimated ) grb rate derived by schmidt ( 2001 ) and obtain the true local rate of grb .",
    "we aim here at obtaining the combined l-@xmath13 distribution function , @xmath19 in the uniform jet model .",
    "the present data is not sufficient to accurately constrain @xmath19 .",
    "we therefore must make some assumptions .",
    "first we estimate the _ isotropic _ luminosity function , @xmath20 , by fitting the peak flux distribution using a simple parametrization of this function .",
    "when considering the angular distribution we also examine ( following perna , sari & frail 2003 ) the usj model and show that the implied peak flux distribution is somewhat inconsistent with the observed one , with the problem most severe at the low end of the peak luminosity distribution .",
    "we find that the data support @xmath21 ( see also van putten & regimbau 2003 ) .",
    "there is a clustering of the true peak luminosity around @xmath22 erg / s , but note that the distribution is not a narrow delta - function .",
    "we notice then that once we have such a relationship the luminosity function implies an angular distribution function .",
    "this is true even when some spread in the value of @xmath23 is taken into account , reflecting the spread observed in current data .",
    "the resulting angular and redshift distributions are consistent with the observations .",
    "our analysis is well motivated but approximate . due to width of the luminosity angle distribution and",
    "given the data quality and selection effects , we believe there is no point in rigorous maximal likelihood analysis and the like . we give approximate estimates of the model parameters and approximate uncertainties .",
    "the paper is structured in two main parts . in the first part we rederive ( following schmidt , 1999 ) the grb luminosity function . in the second part we consider the angular distribution that follows from the luminosity function and the peak luminosity - angle relation .",
    "we compare the predicted angular distribution with the observed one . using this distribution we re -",
    "calculate the correction to the rate of grbs due to beaming . unlike frail et al .",
    ", ( 2001 ) we use a weighted average of the angular distribution .",
    "this yields a significantly smaller correction factor .",
    "we also estimate a the correction factor needed for the usj model . note that this revised correction factor does not depend on the relation between the peak luminosity and the angle .",
    "the observed sample we use to explore the peak luminosity - angle relation is small and its selection effects are hard to quantify . therefore it is difficult to give robust conclusions from our analysis at this stage .",
    "however , future missions and in particular swift will allow us , hopefully in the near future , to use this procedure and test our conclusions with larger and less biased samples .",
    "we consider all the long grbs ( @xmath24sec ) ( kouveliotou et al . , 1993 ) , detected while the batse onboard trigger ( paciesas et al . 1999 ) was set for 5.5 @xmath25 over background in at least two detectors , in the energy range 50 - 300 kev . among those we took the bursts for which @xmath26 at the 1024 ms timescale , where @xmath27 is the count rate in the second brightest illuminated detector and @xmath28 is the minimum detectable rate . using this sample of 595 grbs we find @xmath29 .",
    "the method used to derive the luminosity function is essentially the same of schmidt ( 1999 ) .",
    "we consider a broken power law with lower and upper limits , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the local luminosity function of grb peak luminosities @xmath0 , defined as the co - moving space density of grbs in the interval @xmath32 to @xmath33 is : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a normalization constant so that the integral over the luminosity function equals unity .",
    "we stress that this luminosity function is the  isotropic - equivalent \" luminosity function .",
    "i.e. it does not include a correction factor due to the fact that grbs are beamed .",
    "following schmidt ( 2001 ) we employ the parametrization of porciani & madau ( 2001 ) , in particular , their sfr model sf2 .",
    "@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the grb rate at @xmath38 and @xmath39^{1/2}/(1+z)^{3/2}$ ] .",
    "we consider also the rowan - robinson sfr ( rowan - robinson 1999 : rr - sfr ) that can be fitted with the expression @xmath40 for given values of the parameters @xmath41 we determine @xmath42 so that the predicted value @xmath43 equals the observed one and we find the local rate of grb , @xmath37 , from the observed number of grbs .",
    "we then consider the range of parameters for which there is a reasonable fit to the peak flux distribution ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we use the cosmological parameters @xmath44 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the modeling procedure involves the derivation of the peak flux p(l , z ) of a grb of peak luminosity l observed at redshift z : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the bolometric luminosity distance and @xmath49 is the integral of the spectral energy distribution between @xmath50 kev and @xmath51 kev .",
    "schmidt ( 2001 ) finds that the median value of the spectral photon index in the 50 - 300kev band for the long bursts sample is -1.6 and this can be used for a simplified k - correction .",
    "we use this value for our analysis .    objects with luminosity @xmath0 observed by batse with a flux limit @xmath52 are detectable to a maximum redshift @xmath53 that can be derived from eq .",
    "the limiting flux has a distribution @xmath54 ) that can be obtained from the distribution of @xmath28 of the batse catalog . considering four main representative intervals we get that 6% of the sample has @xmath55 ph @xmath56s@xmath5 , 18% has @xmath57 ph @xmath56s@xmath5 , 52% has @xmath58 ph @xmath56s@xmath5 and 24% has @xmath59 ph @xmath56s@xmath5 .",
    "the inclusion of this variation of @xmath60 , and the implied different samples , is the main difference between our analysis of the luminosity function and schmidt s .",
    "the number of bursts with a peak flux @xmath61 is given by : @xmath62 where the factor @xmath63 accounts for the cosmological time dilation and @xmath64 is the comoving volume element .",
    "we determine @xmath42 so that @xmath29 .",
    "if we approximate schmidt s results ( schmidt 2001 ) the luminosity function can be characterized as two power laws of slopes @xmath65 and @xmath66 , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 and with an isotropic - equivalent break peak luminosity of @xmath69 erg / s and a local grb @xmath70 gpc@xmath4yr@xmath5 . using these values we show in figure 1 that the predicted logn - log@xmath71 distribution does nt agree with the observed logn - log@xmath72 . in principle",
    "one should perform a maximum likelihood analysis to obtain the best values of the luminosity parameters ( and even the grb rate parameters ) .",
    "however , we feel that a simpler approach is sufficient for our purpose , especially in view of the small size of the sample used in the later part of the analysis .",
    "we simply vary @xmath73 and @xmath74 , keeping @xmath67 and @xmath68 and inspect the quality of the fit to the observed logn - log@xmath72 distribution . to obtain the local rate of grbs per unit volume , @xmath37 we need to estimate the effective full - sky coverage of our grb sample .",
    "we find 595 events in this sample that were detected over 1386 days in the 50 - 300 kev channel of batse , with a sky exposure of 48% .",
    "we also take into account that this sample is 47% of the long grbs .    in figure 1",
    "we show a comparison of the observed logn - log@xmath75 with several predicted logn - log@xmath76 distributions obtained with the rr - sfr and with a non evolving luminosity function of the form given in eq .",
    "[ lfun ] ( the distributions are similar for the sf2 ) .",

    "@xmath37 varies by a factor of @xmath80 within a given sfr and as expected it is larger by a factor of @xmath80 in the rr model than in sf2 .    since random errors in a cumulative distribution like @xmath81 propagate in an unknown way",
    ", we present in figure 2 our results for the differential distributions @xmath82 .",
    "we find reasonable fits for the range of @xmath73 and @xmath74 given above .",
    "for our analysis we used 595 long grbs detected at a time scale of 1024 ms from the batse catalog .",
    "a much larger sample is now available in the gusbad catalog which lists 2204 grbs at a time scale of 1024 ms + ( http://www.astro.caltech.edu/  mxs / grb / gusbad ) .",

    "our results are slightly different from schmidt s mainly because we consider a different sample of grbs and the quantity @xmath84 ( which correspond to the observed @xmath72 ) instead of the flux @xmath85 used by schmidt ( 2001 ) . in this way we take into account",
    "the fact that different bursts are detected with different flux thresholds .",
    "so far we have used a parametric fit for the luminosity function . within the usj jet model , with @xmath86 as forced by the energy - angle relation , we have a simple luminosity function : @xmath87 ( perna et al .",
    "2003 ) . in figures 1 and 2",
    "we also compare the predicted logn - log@xmath76 distribution that arises from this luminosity function with the rr - sfr with the observed logn - log@xmath72 distribution .",
    "we find that within the usj scenario the distribution is inconsistent with the data .",
    "the problem arises mostly for low peak fluxes .",
    "it is important to note , however , that our method of grb selection does not introduce a bias against the inclusion of such low peak flux bursts .",
    "a  quasi - universal \" jet ( zhang et al . 2003 ) obviously allows more freedom in fitting the data and may be consistent .",
    "we can use now the luminosity function to derive the observed redshift distribution : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the luminosity corresponding to the minimum peak flux @xmath52 for a burst at redshift z and @xmath90 .",
    "this minimal peak flux corresponds to the sensitivity of the gamma - ray burst detector used .",
    "we use , @xmath91 ph @xmath92 , which is roughly the limiting flux for the grbm on bepposax ( guidorzi phd thesis ) .",
    "we compare this distribution with the observed distribution of all the bursts with an available redshift : 32 bursts from http://www.mpe.mpg.de/  jcg / grbgen.html ( excluding grb980425 with @xmath93 ) .",
    "it is hard to quantify the selection effects that arise in the determination of the redshift .",
    "the problem is most severe in the range @xmath94 where visual spectroscopy ( hogg & fruchter , 1999 ) . following hogg & fruchter ( 1999 ) we consider all the grb with optical afterglow but without a measured redshift to be in this redshift range @xmath94 . using all the bursts in http://www.mpe.mpg.de/",
    "jcg / grbgen.html we have a sample of 46 grbs .",
    "a comparison of the predicted cumulative redshift distribution with the observed one , ( see figure 3 ) , reveals that with sf2 we obtain fewer bursts at low redshift than the observed ones .",
    "this happens even after taking into account the selection effects .",
    "in fact a kolmogorov - smirnoff test ( ks ) shows that the two distributions are only marginally compatible ( 5% level ) .",
    "the rr - sfr seems to reproduce better the redshift distribution , as the ks test shows that they are comparable at the level of 20% .",
    "therefore we will focus on this distribution in the rest of the analysis .",
    "we turn now to the peak luminosity - angle relation , which is analogous to the fluence - angle relation ( frail et al . , 2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "we consider a sample of 9 grbs of the batse 4b catalog for which it has been possible to determine the redshift and the jet opening angle , @xmath13 ( bloom et al .",
    "2003 ) . in order to estimate the peak luminosity we need the peak fluxes .",
    "the advantage in taking only the batse grbs is that we have all the peak fluxes estimated in the same way ( averaged over the 1.024 sec batse trigger in the energy range 50 - 300 kev )    for all the bursts of this sample we estimate the peak luminosity along the jet of opening angle @xmath13 as : @xmath95    in our analysis we consider the angles up to the maximum value implied by the observations ( @xmath96 rad ) . within this range of @xmath13",
    "the beaming factor can be approximated as @xmath97 . in the upper panel of figure 4 ( left side ) we show the distribution of @xmath98 obtained from this sample . comparing this distribution with the isotropic one shown in the lower panel of the same figure ( left side ) we note that the peak luminosity , when corrected for beaming , is clustered around a value @xmath99 erg / s .",
    "a similar result , shown in figure 4 ( right side ) , is obtained when we consider a larger sample , of 19 bursts with an angular estimate from 0.05 to 0.7 radians .",
    "here there are larger uncertainties in the determination of the peak luminosity , as the bursts were detected by different detectors with different averaging time and different spectral resolution .",
    "we have extrapolated the grb fluxes to the batse range 50 - 300 kev using the method described in sethi & bhargavi ( 2001 ) reelaborated for our spectrum . the redshifts and fluxes were taken from the table given in van putten & regimbau ( 2003 ) who also find that the grb peak luminosities and the beaming factors are correlated .",
    "we find a correlation coefficient between @xmath0 and @xmath100 of @xmath101 . the probability to obtain such a large value by chance , for uncorrelated @xmath0 and @xmath100 , is smaller than 0.05 .",
    "the regression line slope of log(l ) vs log(1/f@xmath102 ) is @xmath103 .",
    "the correlation is supported by a recent discovery of a relation between the observed peak energy , @xmath104 , in the spectrum and l ( yonetoku et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this together with the correlation between @xmath104 and the isotropic equivalent energy in @xmath105-rays , @xmath106 , ( amati et al .",
    "2002 and lamb , donaghy & graziani 2003 ) and with the energy - angle relation ( frail et al . , 2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) imply @xmath107 .",
    "however , within the present sample there seem to be some spread in the value of @xmath98 as can be seen from figure 4 . to check the validity of our analysis we take this",
    "spread into account .",
    "we first consider the case in which the distribution of @xmath98 is represented by a narrow - delta function and then discuss the effect of including the observed spread in @xmath98    now if the jet angle and the peak luminosity are related we can derive the real distribution of the grb jet opening angles .",
    "let @xmath108 be the distribution of number of bursts with opening angle @xmath13 and isotropic luminosity @xmath0 .",
    "the observed distribution of number of bursts with opening angle @xmath13 in the small angles approximation can be written as : @xmath109 given the correlation between the grb peak luminosity and the beaming factors we can assume that the condition @xmath110 , with @xmath98 roughly constant for all the grbs , holds . hence we have that @xmath111 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath112 we obtain the intrinsic ( corrected for beaming ) angle distribution : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a normalization constant so that the integral over the angular distribution equals unity and @xmath115 is the break angle of the @xmath13 distribution .",
    "@xmath116rad with our canonical parameters .",
    "this equation should be compared with @xmath117 that is predicted by the usj model .",
    "it is clear that the two distributions are inconsistent for large angles .",
    "a partial agreement is possible only for small angles with @xmath118 .",
    "the disagreement at large angles is just another indication of the fact that luminosity function implied by the usj jet model is incompatible with the observed peak flux distribution at the low flux end ( see figure 1 ) .    substituting this relation in eq.([ptheta ] ) and",
    "after some algebra we find the observed @xmath13 distribution : @xmath119    we compare the theoretical distribution with a sample of 24 grbs with measured @xmath13 values ( blooom et al .",
    "we stress , again , that selection effects are hard to quantify especially for large and small opening angles . in figure 5",
    "we show the predicted cumulative @xmath13 distribution derived from our luminosity function with a rr - sfr and the observed one . we have chosen two values of @xmath98 as representative of the distributions given in figure 4 ( upper panel ) .",
    "we see that with these values of @xmath98 the opening angle distribution reproduces quite well the observed one .",
    "we have repeated the analysis with a distribution of @xmath120 with finite width , @xmath121 , reflecting the spread in @xmath98 values seen in current data ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath13 distribution is similar to the one that arises from the combination of the two values of @xmath98 ( black solid line in figure 5 ) .",
    "once we know the angular distribution we can turn to our final goal and estimate the true grb rate . to do",
    "so we multiply the local observed rate , @xmath37 obtained in  2 by the correction factor that now can be estimated directly from the luminosity function given the relation between @xmath122 and @xmath0 : @xmath123 @xmath124 is the beaming factor averaged over the true , intrinsic , distribution of opening angles .",
    "we expect this average to be smaller that the value derived by frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) due to the following reason : in the _ intrinsic _ luminosity distribution there are many bursts with a low luminosity and large opening angles .",
    "these bursts dominate the rate estimate and this should be factored in when calculating the average rate correction ( sari , 2003 ) .",
    "put differently , in the _ observed _ distribution , bursts with large @xmath0 , i.e. large @xmath125 , are over - represented compared to the true distribution since they are observed to larger distances . in order to see this explicitly , we note that the @xmath124 can be derived directly from the observed distribution of grb peak luminosities without deriving @xmath126 , using the following argument",
    ". the total rate of grbs ( per unit @xmath0 ) in the observable universe is @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the effective volume of the observable universe , @xmath129 ( @xmath130 is the maximum redshift from which signals arrive at us by today ) . the observed rate is @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the volume out to @xmath133 , the maximum redshift out to which bursts can be detected , @xmath134 .",

    "since @xmath136 is decreasing with @xmath0 , a smaller weight is given to large @xmath0 , i.e. to large @xmath125 , than in the observed distribution .",

    "this agreement reflects the fact that our derived @xmath126 gives a fair representation of the data .",
    "the range of values obtained reflects the range of uncertainty given current data .",
    "we can also estimate the correction factor for the rate of grb in the case of the usj model in the following way : the total flux of grbs per year ( or per any other unit of time ) is an observed quantity that can be obtained by summing over the observed distribution . in the usj model",
    "the observed energy - angle relation implies : @xmath146 for @xmath147 and @xmath148 for @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the core angle of the jet . the total energy that a burst with a usj emits is :    @xmath151,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath152 is the maximal angle to which the jet extends .",

    "put differently this suggest that the correction factor for the true rate of usj compared to the rate of observed grbs is a factor of @xmath154 .",
    "the realization that gamma - ray bursts are beamed with rather narrow opening angles , while the following afterglow can be observed over a wider angular range , led to the search for orphan afterglows : afterglows that are not associated with observed prompt grb emission . the observations of orphan afterglows would allow to estimate the opening angles and the true rate of grbs ( rhoads 1997 ) .",

    "the smaller opening angle gives of course more orphan afterglows .",
    "this analysis have to be modified now using the new rate and the new correction factor that we have found .",
    "it is clear that the assumption of a fixed opening angle is not good enough and to obtain the rate of optical orphan afterglows one have to perform another weighted average over the observed @xmath13 distribution .",
    "this weight favors narrow jets which produce orphan afterglows over a wide solid angle and for which the rate correction is large .",
    "overall ( nakar , 2003 ) one has to correct downwards by a factor of 1.6 the rates of the  canonical \" model of nakar , piran & granot ( 2002 ) . the orphan afterglow rate obtained in the ",
