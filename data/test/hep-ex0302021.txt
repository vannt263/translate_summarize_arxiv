    "rare event physics at the low energy frontier is playing a significant role in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "examples of such rare phenomena could be the detection of non - baryonic particle dark matter ( axions or wimps ) , supposedly filling a substantial part of the galactic haloes , or neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "these rare signals , if detected , would be important evidences of a new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics , and would have far - reaching consequences in cosmology .",
    "the experimental achievements accomplished during the last decade in the field of ultra - low background detectors have led to sensitivities capable of searching for such rare events .",
    "dark matter detection experiments have largely benefited from the techniques developed for double beta decay searches .",
    "both types of investigation , which have very close relation from an experimental point of view , are the two main scientific objectives of cuoricino and cuore .",
    "due to the low probability of both types of events , the essential requirement of these experiments is to achieve an extremely low radioactive background . for that purpose",
    "the use of radiopure detector components and shieldings , the instrumentation of mechanisms of background identification , the operation in an ultra - low background environment , in summary , the use of the state - of - the - art of low background techniques is mandatory . in some of these phenomena , like the case of the interaction of a particle dark matter with ordinary matter",
    ", a very small amount of energy is deposited , and the sensitivity needed to detect events within such a range of energies , relies on how low the energy threshold of detection is .",
    "in addition , to increase the chances of observing such rare events a large amount of detector mass is in general advisable , and so most of the experiments devoted to this type of searches are planned to have large detector mass , while keeping the other experimental parameters ( background , energy thresholds and resolutions ) optimized . on the other hand , the recent development of cryogenic particle detection",
    "@xcite has led to the extended use of thermal detectors @xcite to take advantage of the low energy threshold and good energy resolution that are theoretically expected for the thermal signals .",
    "this detection technology has also the advantage of enlarging the choice of materials which can be used , either as dm targets or @xmath2 decay emitters .",
    "after a long period of r&d to master the techniques used in cryogenic particle detectors , low temperature devices of various types are now applied to the detection of double beta decay or particle dark matter @xcite .",
    "a major exponent of this development is the midbd ( _ milano double beta _ )",
    "experiment @xcite , which successfully operated a 20 teo@xmath3 crystal array of thermal detectors of a total mass of 6.8 kg , the largest cryogenic mass operated up to now . with the objective of going to larger detector masses and of improving the sensitivity achieved in the smaller arrays ,",
    "the cuore ( _ cryogenic underground observatory for rare events _ ) project @xcite was born some years ago as a substantial extension of midbd .",
    "the objective of cuore is to construct an array of 1000 bolometric detectors with cubic crystal absorbers of tellurite of 5 cm side and of about 760 g of mass each .",
    "the crystals will be arranged in a cubic compact structure and the experiment will be installed in the gran sasso underground laboratory .",
    "the material to be employed first is teo@xmath3 , because one of the main goals of cuore is to investigate the double beta decay of @xmath1te , although other absorbers could also be used to selectively study several types of rare event phenomenology .",
    "apart from the midbd experiment , already completed , a wide r&d program is under way in the framework of cuoricino , a smaller and intermediate stage of cuore , which consists of 44 of the above crystals ( 790  g in this case ) and 18 smaller crystals ( 330  g ) for a total mass of @xmath440  kg .",
    "cuoricino has been recently installed in the gran sasso laboratory ( lngs ) and is , by far , the largest cryogenic detector on the stage .",
    "the preliminary running tests are encouraging @xcite .    in the present work the prospects are presented for the cuore and cuoricino experiments with respect to their double beta decay discovery potential and their detection capability of wimp and axions . in section [ bc ] considerations of the expected background levels in the energy regions of interest",
    "are made taking into account all relevant sources .",
    "the theoretical motivation of neutrinoless double beta decay experiments as well as the experimental prospects of both cuoricino and cuore are shown in section [ dbd ] . in the same way ,",
    "the physics potential of the experiments is discussed for direct detection of wimps in section [ wimps ] and for solar axion searches in section [ axions ] .",
    "from the radioactive background point of view , thermal detectors are very different than , say , conventional ionization detectors ; the former are sensitive over the whole volume , implying that surface impurities may play an important role . in principle , bolometric detectors like those used in midbd , cuoricino and cuore experiments are expected to have radioactive backgrounds larger than those of conventional germanium ionization detectors , also because the more complex technology of cryodetectors had not yet been fully optimized from the point of view of the radiopurity of the components near the detector . on the other hand ,",
    "the production of radiopure absorbers for thermal detectors is less mastered than the production of radiopure ge crystal .",
    "however , after a considerable r&d effort a significant improvement in the radiopurity of bolometers has been accomplished during recent years , and now these devices have achieved very competitive backgrounds @xcite .",
    "the midbd background @xcite at low energy ( @xmath52 c / kev / kg / d at threshold -10 kev- and at 3500 m.w.e . )",
    "is similar to the measured event rate anticoincident with the veto in the cdms experiment @xcite ( @xmath5 2 c / kev / kg / d at 10 kev and at 20 m.w.e . ) and in the edelweiss experiment @xcite(@xmath5 1.8 c / kev / kg / d at 30 kev and 4000 m.w.e . ) , without a veto , ( in both cases , obviously , prior to charge - heat discrimination ) and is roughly equal to that of dama @xcite and anais @xcite ( @xmath5 1.5 c / kev / kg / d , at 2 kev and 3500 m.w.e . and at 4 kev and 2450 m.w.e",
    ". respectively ) but still one order of magnitude worse than that of igex @xcite ( @xmath5 0.2 and 0.05 c / kev / kg / d at 4 kev and 10 kev respectively , and at 2450 m.w.e . ) . in the double beta decay region ( @xmath5 2.5 mev ) the midbd background values ( @xmath5 0.3 and 0.6 c / kev / kg / y in the old and new set - up respectively ) are competitive but still higher than those of the igex and heidelberg - moscow experiments @xcite ( @xmath5 0.05 c / kev / kg / y at 2 mev ) ( which uses pulse shape discrimination ) .",
    "the challenge of cuore is to significantly reduce the midbd background values ( both in the low and high energy regions ) by , say , two orders of magnitude without using background discrimination mechanisms like the simultaneous measurement of charge ( or light ) and heat .",
    "this reduction will be accomplished by working on both the selection of low contamination materials and on the improvement of the detector geometry and the shielding efficiency .",
    "as one of the main ingredients in the prospective physics potential of the cuoricino and cuore experiments is the level of background achievable , an evaluation of the expected background must be done , including the contribution of all the possible background sources .",
    "a preliminary estimation is contained in ref .",
    "@xcite , a more complete estimate is underway . in the following",
    "we will give a briefing of that reference and will add further considerations .",
    "there are several background sources to be considered : the environmental backgrounds of the underground site ( neutrons from the rocks , environmental @xmath6 flux ... ) , the intrinsic radioactivities of the detectors components and shielding ( bulk and surface ) , the cosmic muon induced backgrounds ( neutrons , muon direct interactions  ) , as well as the possible cosmogenic induced activities produced when the detector and components were outside the underground laboratory .",
    "even the small leakage of two neutrino double beta decay counts emitted by the absorber s nuclei in the relevant region of analysis might be a potential source of background .",
    "the depth at which the experiment will be performed , plus the addition of an efficient cosmic veto and a suitable passive shielding ( lead , polyethylene ,  ) will effectively reduce the external background .",
    "so we will refer mainly to the intrinsic background , although we will make some remarks concerning the other sources . on the other hand ,",
    "the experience gained in the midbd experiment , where the measured background is used as a test - bench for checking the mc estimates , has been essential in predicting the expectations for cuoricino and cuore . using the midbd results and the cuoricino tests",
    "a monte carlo study of the expected intrinsic background has been carried out for the cuoricino and cuore set - ups .",
    "radioactive impurities in the bulk of the tellurite crystals , as well as in the dilution refrigerator and surrounding shielding were assumed .",
    "background suppression due to the anticoincidence between crystals ( which will be significant in the cuore set up ) was calculated .",
    "the code is based on the geant-4 @xcite package ; it models in detail the shields , the cryostat , the detector structure and the detector array for the midbd , cuoricino and cuore experiments .",
    "it includes the propagation of photons , electrons , @xmath7 particles and heavy ions ( nuclear recoils from @xmath7 emission ) as well as neutrons and muons . for the simulated radioactive chains ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) or radioactive isotopes ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) alpha , beta and @xmath6 /x ray emmissions are considered according to their branching ratios .",
    "the time structure of the decay chains is taken into account and the transport of nuclear recoils from alpha emissions is included .",
    "the 20 crystal midbd array was operated in two different configurations @xcite , the difference between the two was that in the latter configuration the roman lead shield surrounding the detectors was improved by increasing its thickness , and that the crystals as well as their copper mounting structures underwent a new surface treatment .",
    "the crystals were re - polished with superpure powders while the copper was cleaned with a chemical process .",
    "the result was an improvement in the background measured in the second configuration ( midbd - ii ) with respect to that measured in the previous one ( midbd - i ) either in the gamma region ( below 3 mev ) and in the @xmath7 region ( between 3 and 10 mev ) .",
    "the @xmath7 peaks identified in midbd - i as due to a surface u and th contamination of the crystals were reduced by a factor 2 .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath7 contaminations , together with the reduction of the @xmath12tl line at 2615 kev is probably responsible of the improvement obtained in the 2448 - 2556 kev ( 0@xmath132@xmath14 decay ) region where the counting rate changed from b=0.59@xmath150.06 c / kev / kg / y in midbd - i to b=0.33@xmath150.11 c / kev / kg / y in midbd - ii @xcite . during midbd - ii run ,",
    "a 10 cm thick borated polyethylene shield was mounted outside the external lead shield but no improvement in the counting rate was obtained proving that the backgroud was still dominated by other radioactive sources . with the above background value",
    "the lower limit of the neutrinoless half - life of @xmath16 obtained is @xmath17 y , or equivalently , an upper bound for the majorana neutrino mass @xmath18 of 0.9 - 5.2  ev ( depending on the nuclear matrix element calculation ) , which is the second - best published result @xcite . as far as the low energy region",
    "is concerned , the background of midbd stands around 2.3 c / kev / kg / day between 10 and 50 kev and 0.5 c / kev / kg / day between 50 and 80 kev , region where the dark matter signal is expected @xcite . with these background values ,",
    "the exclusion plot of wimps interacting coherently with te and o is depicted as the ( dashed ) contour of figure [ cuoricino_exclusion ] .",
    "to understand what are the main sources responsible of the midbd background the mc code developed to study cuore background was used to reproduce the results obtained in the two configurations in which the midbd 20 crystal array was operated @xcite .",
    "the radioactive impurities used as inputs were all the contaminants identified in the midbd background spectrum , through an analysis of the @xmath7 and @xmath6 lines : @xmath19u chain in secular equilibrium , @xmath19u chain broken at the level of @xmath20ra , @xmath21bi or @xmath22pb , @xmath23th chain in secular equilibrium , @xmath24k and @xmath25co .",
    "either bulk contaminations ( with a uniform and isotropic distribution ) and surface contaminations ( with an exponential density profile and various depths ) were considered .",
    "the details of this analysis are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the results obtained can be summarized as follows : the mc simulation is able to reproduce the measured background spectrum , allowing the identification and localization of the most probable sources of background .",
    "it proves that a large contribution to the counting rate in both the low energy region and the 0@xmath132@xmath14 region comes from the surface contaminations of the crystals and of the copper structure facing the bare crystals . in the case of the crystals , the origin of this contamination",
    "is known : it is due to the use of contaminated powders during the optical polishing of the crystals produced by the shanghai quinhua material company ( sqm ) in china . indeed",
    "the re - treatment of their surfaces by means of low contamination powders reduced the contamination to one half .",
    "for this reason it was agreed that the cuoricino crystals would undergo only a minor surface treatment in china ( the one indispensable to check crystal quality ) and were subsequently polished in italy using low contamination powders . on the contrary , the origin of the copper surface contamination is still uncertain : it could either have been produced during the machining of the metal or during the surface acid treatment . as the cuoricino copper structure was produced with the same technique of the midbd - ii",
    "a similar contamination may have been produced .",
    "for cuore a dedicated r@xmath26d is foreseen to reduce or cancel this kind of contamination .",
    "finally , other important contributions come from bulk contamination of the structures outside the roman lead shield that surrounds the detector and from outside the cryostat . evaluating each impurity for each simulated element , the maximum contribution to the measured background by bulk contamination of teo@xmath3 ,",
    "copper and roman lead were obtained and have been used in cuore simulation .",
    "cuoricino will be operated in the same set - up as that of the midbd experiment : the same dilution refrigerator , the same cryostat , the same external lead and borated - polyethylene shield , at the same underground location ( a description of the set - up can be found in ref .",
    "the crystals will be different but the measured upper limits of their u and th contamination are again of the order of 10@xmath27  g / g .",
    "therefore bulk contribution to cuoricino background should be not larger than that measured in midbd - ii .",
    "on the other hand , for surface contamination some improvement with respect to midbd - ii result is foreseen thanks to the different surface treatment of the crystals and to a reduced exposure of detectors to dust and rn .",
    "a reasonable guess for cuoricino is therefore a background of @xmath5 0.1 c / kev / kg / y in the @xmath28 region , slightly better than the one measured in midbd - ii ; while in the dark matter region a background of the order of 1 - 0.1 c / kev / kg / d is anticipated .    on the contrary",
    "no extrapolation of the background achievable in cuore is possible from the midbd data , nor from the cuoricino results .",
    "this is true for several reasons : the different structure of the detector ( in the case of cuore an efficient reduction of background events will be provided by operating the detectors of the array in anticoincidence , without loosing efficiency in detecting wimps or 0@xmath132@xmath14 decay events ) , the different cryostat and shielding systems , and finally because a much more severe selection of the constructing materials and a much better control on their mechanical working and chemical cleaning will be applied .",
    "also predictions based on mc simulations are not straightforward since they depend critically on the assumed inputs : contamination levels , detector design , etc . here",
    "we present a very conservative evaluation of the background reachable with cuore , mainly based on the state of the art of detector design and on the knowledge of radioactive contamination .",
    "the cuore construction will require about five years and in the meantime an @xmath29 dedicated to background reduction will be realised .",
    "this approach for intrinsic background evaluation could be rather pessimistic but it is the only one that presently guarantees a reliable but possibly conservative prediction .    in cuore (",
    "a description of the set - up can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the main contribution to background due to bulk contaminations comes from the heavy structures near the detectors ( the copper mounting structure of the array , the roman - lead box and the two lead disks on the top of the array ) and from the detectors themselves ( the @xmath30 crystals ) . in the simulation , the @xmath9 , @xmath8 , @xmath10 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 impurities of @xmath30 , copper and lead as well as the @xmath11 cosmogenic contamination of copper",
    "are conservatively assumed equal to the 90% c.l .",
    "upper limits obtained for the contamination levels of those materials measured in midbd experiment or in low hp@xmath35 spectrometry @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 cosmogenic contamination of @xmath30 is on the other hand evaluated according to the time required to produce @xmath30 powder from the ore , grow the crystals and store them underground @xcite . with these contaminations , assuming a threshold of 10 kev and using the results obtained after the reduction by anti - coincidence between detectors , the background due to bulk contaminations is @xmath36  counts/(kev  kg  y ) in the @xmath37 decay region and @xmath38  counts/(kev  kg  d ) in the low energy region ( 10 - 50  kev ) . on the other hand ,",
    "surface contaminations contribute to background only when they are localized on the crystals or on the copper mounting structure directely facing them . in the simulation , u and",
    "th surface contaminations are assumed to be : for crystals @xmath5  100 times lower and for copper @xmath5  50 times lower than the corresponding contamination in midbd experiment .",
    "the midbd crystals were contaminated during the polishing procedure due to the use of highly contaminated powders .",
    "polishing powders with a radioactive content 1000 times lower are however commercially available and have already been used for cuoricino , an improvement of the surface contamination of a factor 100 is therefore fully justified .",
    "a similar situation holds for copper . in the midbd experiment",
    "the copper surfaces were treated with an etching procedure studied to reduce impurities on surfaces before the sputtering process .",
    "this procedure resulted in an improvement of the surface quality of copper , however it is not optimized from the point of view of background .",
    "the use -for the surface treatment- of low contamination liquids in a low background environment , and special care in the mechanical working and handling will allow an improvement between one and two orders of magnitude in the surface contamination of copper .",
    "with such a contamination the surface contribution is estimated to be 2.8@xmath39  counts/(kev  kg",
    "y ) in the 0@xmath132@xmath14 region and @xmath40  counts/(kev  kg  d ) in the dark matter region .    finally , the unavoidable background produced by the @xmath41 decay region is lower than 10@xmath42  counts/(kev  kg",
    "y ) in the 0@xmath132@xmath14 region and @xmath43  counts/(kev  kg  d ) in the dark matter region ( assuming 3.8@xmath44 y for the @xmath1te @xmath45 half - life @xcite ) .      concerning the cosmogenic activation produced by cosmic rays when the crystals are above ground ( during fabrication and shipping of the crystals from the factory to the underground laboratory ) we used a code based on computed cross sections to estimate the amount and type of radionuclides produced by cosmic rays on teo@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the comparison between our prediction and the midbd - i and ii run data is discussed in ref .",
    "the radionuclei produced by the activation of tellurium are mostly tellurium isotopes ( a=121,123,125,127 ) as well as @xmath46sb , @xmath47sb , @xmath25co and tritium , these last three being of more concern because of their long half - life ( @xmath47sb :  beta decay of 2.7 years , end - point energy of 767 kev , @xmath25co :  beta decay of 5.27 years end - point energy 2823 kev and @xmath48h :  beta decay of 12.3 years , end - point energy of 18 kev ) . in midbd - i",
    "no clear evidence of cosmogenic activation was present ( the crystals were stored underground for several months ) , while in midbd - ii the @xmath6 lines of the tellurium isotopes were clearly seen , with an intensity that is in good agreement with our prediction ( based on the period they were reexposed because of the repolishing process ) .",
    "the history of the cuoricino crystals is rather similar to those of midbd , therefore their cosmogenic activation is already included in the extrapolation of cuoricino background from midbd data . in the case of cuore the control on crystal production will be more severe .",
    "the sqm that produces the crystals , oxidizing the tellurium ore and growing a 760 g crystal in about two months , will require two years to grow the 1000 cuore detectors .",
    "once grown , the crystals will be shipped to italy and stored underground , therefore their total exposition to cosmic rays will be limited to about 4 months .",
    "the total induced activities remaining after 2 years underground have been estimated @xcite and the consequent contribution to the detector counting rate was deduced by a mc simulation .",
    "the radionuclei that contribute to background through their @xmath49 decay are :    * in the 0@xmath132@xmath14 region , the long lived @xmath25co isotope with an activity of @xmath50.2  @xmath50bq / kg , while a minor contribution is due to the isotopes @xmath51ag and @xmath46sb whose activity is 4 times lower and fast decreasing with time ; * in the dark matter region , the long lived nuclei of @xmath48h and @xmath47sb with an activity of @xmath57  @xmath50bq / kg for the former and of @xmath515  @xmath50bq / kg for the latter .",
    "the influence of @xmath25co in the cuore background was already considereded in the evaluation of the contributions due to bulk contaminations of the crystals , while the contribution of @xmath48h and @xmath47sb to the dark matter region is completely negligible ( @xmath52  counts/(kev  kg  d ) ) if compared to the intrinsic background .",
    "as noted before , neither contributions from underground cosmic muons nor neutrons have been taken into account in detail in the estimation of the background .",
    "however , the following simplified arguments will serve to have an approximate idea of their contribution .",
    "the depth of the lngs ( 3500 m.w.e ) reduces the muon flux to @xmath52@xmath53  @xmath54s@xmath55 , but a further effective reduction could be obtained with the use of an efficient ( 99.9% ) active veto to detect muons traversing the detectors and to tag possible events associated with them .",
    "consequently , the muon - induced events contributing to the background are expected to be only a small component of it . on the other hand",
    ", the shielding will substantially reduce the event rate due to particles external to the detector from various sources ( neutrons and photons ) , from radioactivity in the environment ( natural decay chains u / th , @xmath22pb , @xmath24k ,  ) , as well as muon - induced in the surroundings or in the shielding itself . the passive shielding either for midbd , for cuoricino and for cuore consists of a neutron screen ( blocks of -borated- polyethylene of 10 cm thickness ) to moderate and attenuate neutrons and a lead shell to attenuate the incoming external photons ; the innermost part ( 10 cm thick ) is made of special lead with a small content ( @xmath5616 bq / kg ) of @xmath22pb ( half - life 22 years ) while the outer part ( 10 cm thick ) is made of modern lead ( @xmath22pb @xmath56150bq / kg ) both with a low level of th and u.    neutrons may constitute a worrisome background in dark matter experiments because for appropriate neutron energies ( few mev ) they can produce nuclear recoils in the detector target nuclei which would mimic wimp interactions .",
    "simple kinematics tells that in the case of tellurium , neutrons of 1 to 5 mev could elastically scatter off tellurium nuclei producing recoils of energies up to 31 to 154 kev . in general , one considers neutrons of two origins : from radioactivity in the surroundings or muon - induced .",
    "depending on the overburden of the underground site ( i.e. , depending on the muon flux ) , muon - induced neutrons are produced , at lesser or greater rate , both inside and outside the shielding .",
    "they are moderated according to their energies by the polyethylene and lead shield ( when produced outside ) or tagged by the muon veto coincidence ( when produced within the passive shielding ) .",
    "a certain fraction of the neutrons of a few mevs produced outside can pass the veto reaching the detector and producing `` dangerous '' nuclear recoils and @xmath6 background .",
    "however , a significant fraction of the associated events can be vetoed because of their interaction with the veto and also because of the hadronic showers initiated by the muons ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the case of external neutrons ( from the rocks , from fission processes or from ( n,@xmath7 )",
    "reactions , as well as neutrons originated by muons in the walls of the underground site ) , the environmental neutron flux has been measured in lngs .",
    "the resulting flux is of @xmath57 @xmath54s@xmath55 for the thermal component , @xmath58 @xmath54s@xmath55 for the epithermal and @xmath59 @xmath54s@xmath55 for energies over 2.5 mev @xcite .",
    "they are fairly well moderated by the polyethylene and eventually absorbed or captured .",
    "we have carried out a monte carlo simulation of the propagation of neutrons through the 10 cm thick borated polyethylene shield of cuoricino and cuore .",
    "the result is that the neutron induced event rate on the entire energy range ( from threhsold to 10 mev ) is much lower than the contribution due the bulk contamination of crystals .",
    "other neutrons , produced by muon interactions inside the shielding materials , are very scarce and tagged as events coincident with the muon veto .",
    "as it is well - known , muon - induced neutrons are originated in a variety of processes .",
    "the reduction of muon flux in underground sites results in a substantial depletion of the associated neutrons and below @xmath5100 m.w.e .",
    "the dominant sources of neutrons are nuclear fission processes and ( n,@xmath7 ) reactions in rocks and other environmental material with sizeable content of u / th .",
    "the energy spectrum of muon - induced neutrons is approximated by an inverse energy power law ( @xmath60 for 1 - 50 kev and @xmath61 above 50 kev ) but other neutron energy spectra have been proposed .",
    "the neutron yield per muon can be approximately evaluated for an organic compound through the simple expression @xmath62",
    "neutrons/(g  @xmath54 ) per muon @xcite which fits the value of 1.5@xmath63 neutrons/(g  @xmath54 ) of the muon - induced neutron flux measured by the lvd experiment at gran sasso @xcite .    for the lngs muon flux ( 2.5@xmath53 @xmath50/(@xmath64s ) ) , muons would produce in the cuore shielding of polyethylene ( 10 cm ) and lead ( 20 cm ) ) about @xmath50.04 neutrons/(m@xmath65 day ) in the polyethylene shield and @xmath525 neutrons/(m@xmath65 day ) in the lead shell .",
    "so , independently of the mechanism set up to reject or tag the events associated to neutrons , their rather small number is expected to play a secondary role in the total background compared with other , intrinsic , sources of background .",
    "a preliminary evaluation of the influence of the environmental @xmath6 background in gran sasso @xcite resulted in a negligible contribution for the @xmath28 region and a contribution similar to that of bulk contaminations for the dark matter region .",
    "a more complete and detailed study of the external , non intrinsic background rates for cuore is underway .",
    "summarizing , for cuoricino a background similar to the one measured in midbd - ii is the most conservative prediction either in the dark matter region or in the @xmath28 region . for cuore on the other hand ,",
    "the previous sections have shed light on how the background contamination dominating the two regions of interest is mostly the intrinsic background due to bulk and surface contaminations of the contructing materials . with the presently achieved quality of low contamination materials and",
    "considering the worst possible condition for bulk contaminations ( i.e. all the contamination equal to the present 90%/,c.l .",
    "measured upper limits ) we have proved that cuore background will be @xmath66  counts/(kev  kg",
    "y ) at the @xmath28 transition energy and @xmath67  counts/(kev  kg  d ) near threshold . even at these conservative values cuore is , as we will prove in the following , a powerful instrument to search for double beta decay and dark matter .",
    "however , the goal of the cuore technical @xmath68 of the next few years will be the reduction of background to the level of 0.001  counts/(kev  kg",
    "y ) at the @xmath28 transition energy and to 0.01  counts/(kev  kg  d ) at threshold . the potential of the experiment in this background configuration will also be discussed .    regarding the expected threshold and resolution , in the cuoricino test experiment @xcite energy thresholds of @xmath69 kev",
    "have been obtained and a resolution of 1 kev at the 46 kev line of @xmath22pb was achieved in some of the detectors .",
    "details can be found in ref .",
    "we will assume a conservative value of 10 kev for the energy threshold of both cuoricino and cuore , and energy resolutions of 1 kev at threshold .",
    "as far as the energy resolutions obtained in the double beta decay region , values of 3 kev at 2615 kev were achieved in some crystals but they are worse ( by a factor two ) in others .",
    "an energy resolution of 5 kev will be assumed both for cuore and for cuoricino .",
    "taking into account these expectations , we discuss in the following the prospects of cuoricino and cuore for double beta decay searches ( section 3 ) , for wimp detection ( section 4 ) and for solar axion exploration ( section 5 ) .",
    "one of the main scientific objectives of the cuore detector is the search for the neutrinoless double - beta decay of the @xmath1te isotope contained in the ( natural ) teo@xmath3 crystals .",
    "the importance of nuclear double - beta decay as an invaluable tool to explore particle physics beyond the standard model has been repeatedly emphasized and widely reported @xcite . in the standard model of particle physics neutrinos",
    "are strictly massless , although there is no theoretical reason for such a prejudice . on the experimental side ,",
    "moreover , there exist strong evidences from atmospheric neutrino data ( from superkamiokande @xcite ) , from experiments with solar neutrinos ( from homestake , gran sasso and kamioka @xcite ) and from reactor experiments ( from kamland @xcite ) which suggest that neutrinos have indeed masses and oscillate among the three species .",
    "the results of the solar @xmath13 experiment from sno with both cc ( charged current ) and nc ( neutral current ) interactions @xcite , also combined with superk have definitively provided a strong evidence that neutrinos change of flavour and , consequently , the existence of non - zero mass neutrinos .",
    "the recent results of kamland @xcite exclude all oscillation solutions but the large mixing angle solution to the solar neutrino problem using reactor antineutrino sources .",
    "however , neutrino oscillation experiments provide the squared mass difference between the neutrino species but not their absolute value and scale .",
    "the neutrinoless double beta decay would help to solve this question and to disentangle the hierarchy scheme of the neutrino flavours .",
    "most of the models ( see @xcite ) indicate that the majorana neutrino mass parameter could be around ( or slightly below ) @xmath70 ev , value within reach of the future double beta decay experiments , like cuore .",
    "majorana massive neutrinos are common predictions in most theoretical models , and the value of a few tens of millielectronvolts predicted for its effective mass , if reached experimentally -as expected- will test its majorana nature .",
    "double - beta decay experiments with even better sensitivities ( of the order of a few mev ) will be essential to fix the absolute neutrino mass scale and possibly to provide information on cp violation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , galaxy formation requires a small amount of hot non - baryonic dark matter likely in form of neutrinos to match properly the observed spectral power at all scales of the universe .",
    "the question of the neutrino mass is one of the main issues in particle physics .    in the standard model , neutrinos and antineutrinos",
    "are assumed to be different particles , but no experimental proof has been provided so far .",
    "nuclear double - beta decay addresses both questions : whether the neutrinos are self - conjugated and whether they have majorana mass .",
    "in fact , the lepton number violating neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) is the most direct way to determine if neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "another form of neutrinoless decay , @xmath73 may reveal also the existence of the majoron ( @xmath74 ) , the goldstone boson emerging from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the @xmath75 symmetry which is of most relevance in the generation of majorana neutrino mass and has far - reaching implications in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "moreover , the observation of a @xmath72 decay would imply a lower bound for the neutrino mass , i. e. at least one neutrino eigenstate has a non - zero mass .",
    "it is quite straightforward to demonstrate how the determination of the effective majorana mass of the electron neutrino constrains the lightest neutrino mass eigenvalue .",
    "this was done recently by barger , glashow , marfatia and whistnant @xcite .",
    "however it is very convenient to use the approximation that @xmath76 and @xmath77 . with the further assumption @xmath78 in the normal hierarchy case",
    "we obtain : @xmath79 where @xmath80 . similarly in the case of inverted hierarchy : @xmath81 a related quantity , @xmath82 has great importance in cosmology .",
    "it is related to the quantity @xmath83 , the fraction of the critical density , @xmath84 ( that would close the universe ) that is in the form of neutrinos , where : @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the dimensionless hubble constant .",
    "it was shown in reference @xcite that @xmath87 obeys the following inequality with respect to @xmath88 : @xmath89 where the @xmath90 and @xmath91 signes refer to normal and inverted hierarchies respectively , and @xmath92 .",
    "if this relation is written as two equalities , and each side is solved for @xmath93 in terms of @xmath87 , quadratic equations result with the constant terms @xmath94 .",
    "values of @xmath95 of cosmological interest are much larger than @xmath96 ev ( 99.73% c.l . ) .",
    "accordingly the above inequality reduces to the trivial form : @xmath97 this clearly demonstrates the direct connection between neutrinoless double beta decay and neutrino dark matter .",
    "cosmic microwave background and galaxy cluster surveys have set the bound @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the map satellite will produce data that will result in a sensitivity @xmath99 .",
    "one possible interesting scenario results in the case the map satellite , if for example it observes a clear singal well above their limiting sensitivity , and cuore ( as well as other next generation experiments ) have a negative results at sensitivities of @xmath87 far below that of the satellite data .",
    "this would be a clear indication that the phenomenon causing the density fluctuations implied by the cmb data was not caused by majorana neutrino dark matter .",
    "in addition a positive measurement of the mass @xmath100 by katrin @xmath101 beta end - point spectrum measurement would have to yield @xmath102 .",
    "the cuore experiment will have a far greater sensitivity , and if it found a negative result , the mistery of dirac or majorana character of neutrinos will be solved .",
    "these and other issues , make the search for the neutrinoless double beta decay an invaluable tool for the exploration of non - standard model physics , probing energy scales well above those reachable with accelerators .",
    "that is the motivation of why there are dozens of experiments underway looking for the double beta decay of various nuclei @xcite like @xmath103 ( igex @xcite , heidelberg - moscow @xcite ) , @xmath104 and others ( nemo @xcite , elegants @xcite ) and @xmath16 ( midbd , cuoricino ) and a few big experimental projects , like cuore , majorana @xcite ( @xmath103 ) , moon @xcite ( @xmath104 ) and exo @xcite ( @xmath105 ) .",

    "as far as the tellurium oxide is concerned , the @xmath1te isotope is a good candidate for double beta decay searches : its isotopic content in natural tellurium is 33.87% , and its 2@xmath14 q - value ( @xmath109 kev ) is reasonably high to escape from the main radioimpurity lines when looking for a neutrinoless signal .",
    "moreover , this q - value happens to be between the peak and the compton edge of the 2615 kev line of @xmath12tl , which leaves a clean window to look for the signal .",
    "finally , it has a fairly good neutrinoless nuclear factor - of - merit @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is an integrated kinematical factor qualifying the goodness of the @xmath112 value ( large phase space ) and @xmath113 is the neutrinoless double - beta decay nuclear matrix elements characterizing the likeliness of the transition .    in table",
    "[ tab_doblebeta ] we quote the values of @xmath114 in the case of @xmath1te calculated in various nuclear models @xcite , together with those of other emitters used in source / detector calorimeters .",
    "it can be seen that no matter the nuclear model is used to compute the neutrinoless double - beta decay matrix elements , the merits of @xmath1te are a factor 510 more favorable than those of @xmath115ge ( the emitter where the best neutrinoless double beta decay half - life limits have been achieved so far ) , which translates into a factor 2 to 3 better as far as the @xmath116 ( majorana neutrino mass parameter ) bounds are concerned .    the detector factor - of - merit @xmath117 , or detection sensitivity , introduced earlier by fiorini , provides an approximate estimate of the neutrinoless half - life limit achievable with a given detector .",

    "recent cosmological observations @xcite provide compelling evidence for the existence of an important component of non - baryonic cold dark matter in the universe . among the candidates to compose this matter , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) and axions are the front runners .",
    "the lightest stable particles of supersymmetric theories , like the neutralino @xcite , constitute a particular class of wimps .    under the hypothesis that wimps are the main component of the dark matter",
    ", these particles should fill the galactic haloes and explain the flat rotation curves which are observed in many galaxies .",
    "the detection of such particles could be attempted both by means of direct and indirect methods .",
    "the direct detection of wimps relies on the measurement of their elastic scattering off the target nuclei of a suitable detector@xcite .",
    "the non relativistic and heavy ( gev  tev ) wimps could hit a detector nucleus producing a nuclear recoil of a few kev . because of the small wimp - matter interaction cross sections the rate is extremely low . in the case of susy wimps ,",
    "most of the cross section predictions @xcite ( derived using mssm as the basic frame implemented with different unification hypothesis ) encompass a range of values several orders of magnitude ( the so - called scatter plots ) providing rates ranging from 1 c / kg / day down to 10@xmath145",
    "c / kg / day according to the particular susy model .",
    "it is well known that the predicted signal for the wimp elastic scattering has an exponentially decaying energy dependence , hardly distinguishable from the background recorded in the detector .",
    "the simple comparison of the theoretical wimp spectrum with the one experimentally obtained , provides an exclusion curve ( at a given confidence level ) , as dark matter component of the halo , of those wimps with masses ( @xmath146 ) and cross sections on nucleons ( @xmath147 ) which yield spectra above the measured experimental rate . to claim a positive identification of the wimp ,",
    "however , a distinctive signature is needed .",
    "the only identification signals of the wimp explored up to now are provided by the features of the earth s motion with respect to the dark matter halo . in particular , the annual modulation @xcite is originated by the combination of the motion of the solar system in the galactic rest frame and the rotation of the earth around the sun . due to this effect , the incoming wimp s velocities in the detector rest frame change continuously during the year , having a maximum in summer and a minimum in winter . therefore the total wimp rate changes in time with an oscillating frequency which corresponds to an annual period and a maximum around the beginning of june .",
    "the relative annual variation of the signal is small ( a few percent ) so in order to detect it one needs large detector masses to increase statistics and several periods of exposure to minimize systematics .",
    "several experiments have already searched for this effect @xcite and since 1997 one group has reported a positive signal @xcite which has been appearing throughout four yearly periods . the present situation is no doubt exciting : on one hand that result has triggered an intense activity in the field ; on the other , the experimental sensitivities of various types of underground detectors are entering the supersymmetric parameter space @xcite and in particular several of them @xcite are excluding , to a larger or lesser degree , the region of mass and cross - section where the reported wimp is supposed to exist .",
    "new data from one of them @xcite have excluded totally the dama region .",
    "we will discuss in the following the capabilities of cuoricino and cuore to exclude or detect wimps using the total time - integrated experimental rate and comparing it with the predicted nuclear recoil rate . to look for the annual modulation signal in cuoricino / cuore experiments , which in principle have enough mass to be sensitive to it",
    ", one needs to know their stability performances .",
    "the analysis of the cuore / cuoricino potential for annual modulation searches will be performed -following statistical consideration- ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , with the proviso that systematic uncertainties are under control .",
    "data on the stability of cuoricino will be crucial to assess such hypotheses .    to calculate the theoretical wimp rate , standard hypothesis and astrophysical parameters are assumed , i.e. , that the wimps form an isotropic , isothermal , non - rotating halo ( the isothermal sphere model ) of density @xmath148 gev/@xmath126 , which has a maxwellian velocity distribution with @xmath149 km / s ( with an upper cut corresponding to an escape velocity of 650 km / s ) , and a relative earth - halo velocity of @xmath150 km / s ) .",
    "other , more elaborated halo models , which have been considered recently @xcite would lead to different results .",
    "the same applies when other astrophysical parameters are employed or when uncertainties in the halo wimps velocity distribution are included @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predicted rate is expressed in terms of the mass and cross - section of the wimp - matter interaction .",
    "the cross sections are normalized per nucleon assuming a dominant scalar interaction , as is expected , for instance , for one of the most popular dark matter candidates , the neutralino :    @xmath151    where @xmath119 is the target ( oxygen and tellurium ) mass number , @xmath152 , is the wimp - nucleus reduced mass , and @xmath153 the wimp - nucleon reduced mass . the helm parameterization @xcite is used for the scalar nucleon form factor . the @xmath154 exclusion plot is then derived by requiring the theoretically predicted signal for each @xmath146 and @xmath147 in each energy bin to be less than or equal to the ( 90% c.l . ) upper limit of the ( poisson ) recorded counts .",

    "the value 0.1 c / kev / kg / day is a one - order - of - magnitude extrapolation from that currently achieved in midbd ( see discussion on section 2 ) and is close to the one obtained above 50 kev . in the case of cuore ,",
    "background values of 0.05 and 0.01 c / kev / kg / day will be assumed .",
    "notice , moreover , that values of a few 0.01 c / kev / kg / day have been obtained above 10 kev in the raw spectra of germanium experiments ( like igex @xcite ) without using mechanisms of background rejection , and so it does not seem impossible to achieve such equivalent small values in crystal thermal detectors of tellurium ( only phonons , and no discrimination mechanism ) . to draw the two exclusion contours of fig .",
    "[ cuoricino_exclusion ] , a low energy resolution of 1 kev and an energy threshold of 10 kev have been assumed as well as an exposure of 2 years of cuoricino ( 81 kg@xmath155year ) .",

    "as previously noted , cuore and to some extent cuoricino have detector masses large enough to search for the annual modulation signal . as it is well known , an essential requirement to estimate the prospects of any detector to search for annual modulation is to have a superb control of systematic errors and to assure that the stability of the various experimental parameters , which might mimic periodic variations of the signals , are kept within a small fraction of the ( already tiny ) expected signal .",
    "the various changes of the set - up , crystals and shielding of the midbd experiment have not provided a definitive estimation of the long - term stability parameters of midbd .",
    "possible instabilities are that of the electronic gain and the ensuing time fluctuation of the energy scale ( both in energy thresholds and energy resolutions ) , the temperature variations , the possible fluctuation in time of the efficiency with which the triggered noise is rejected and others . they must be kept well below the small expected seasonal modulation of the wimp signal",
    "the fact that we are dealing with a very small signal depending on time , which typically amounts to a fraction between 1% and 7% of the average count rates , reinforces the need for a control of the stability of the experiment well below that range over long periods of time .",
    "when assuming that all these fluctuations are controlled well below the levels needed ( @xmath561% ) , then one can proceed to analyze the sensitivity of cuoricino / cuore to the annual modulation signal on purely statistical grounds .",

    "as was described at length in ref .",
    "@xcite , the crucial parameters for estimating the perspectives on solar axion detectors with crystals rely on the energy threshold and resolution ( appearing in @xmath164 ) , and the level of background achieved ( although the influence of this parameter is damped by a factor 1/8 ) .",
    "in particular , a threshold of 5 - 8 kev would loose most of the axion signal .",
    "other crystal detectors with , say , ge or nai ( genius , majorana , gedeon , dama , libra , anais ,  ) could surpass cuore as axion detectors because the energy thresholds of these projects are supposed to be significantly lower .",

    "there are no realistic chances to challenge the limit inferred from hb stars counting in globular clusters @xcite and a discovery of the axion by cuore would presumably imply either a systematic effect in the stellar - count observations in globular clusters or a substantial change in the theoretical models that describe the late - stage evolution of low - metallicity stars . to obtain lower values of @xmath185",
    "one should go to the magnet helioscopes like that of tokio @xcite and that of cern ( cast experiment @xcite currently being mounted ) .",
    "in particular , the best current experimental bound of @xmath185 published comes from the tokyo helioscope : @xmath189 gev@xmath55 for @xmath190 ev and @xmath191 gev@xmath55 for @xmath192 ev .",
    "the sensitivity of cast is supposed to provide a bound @xmath193 gev@xmath55 or even lower .",
    "a recent , preliminary run of cast , with only @xmath55 hours of `` axion light '' has improved already the tokyo limit .",
    "we have reported the perspectives of cuore , a projected massive 760 kg array of 1000 teo@xmath3 bolometers , and of its first stage cuoricino , with 40 kg of the same crystals , as far as their physics potential to detect various types of rare events is concerned .",
    "the estimated background and resolution , based on monte carlo studies , together with the results obtained in recent improvements in the performances of the midbd experiment and the information obtained from the preliminary tests of cuoricino , have allowed us to assess the potentialities of these experiments for double beta decay searches , solar axion detection and wimp exclusion or identification . in these three types of searches , cuore and to some extent",
    "cuoricino will be powerful tools to explore , with higher sensitivity , such rare phenomena .",
    "this work has been partially supported by the spanish cicyt ( contract aen99 - 1033 ) , italian infn , the us national science foundation and the eu network ( contract erb - fmrx - ct-98 - 0167 ) .",
    "thanks are due to our student f. capozzi for the work done on the mc simulations , and to g. luzon for discussions on the cosmogenic activation of the crystals .",
