    "after the introduction of penicillin and mass vaccination campaigns of the 1950s , it was thought that infectious diseases would soon be a thing of the past .",
    "however , infectious diseases have turned out to be an intractable problem , as new infectious diseases continually emerge while previously existing diseases circumvent existing control measures through evolution .",
    "accordingly , there is a continuing need to develop mathematically rigorously methods that can be applied to infectious disease epidemiology , in order to predict future spread of infections and assess the likely impacts of alternative control measures , including vaccination .",
    "one such area of promise emerging from the field of probability is branching processes .",
    "infectious disease transmission can be thought of as a branching process in which each infected individual in a given generation of infection produces some number of infected individuals in the next generation , as described by a probability density function .",
    "this picture is particularly apt in the early stages of an outbreak , when the proportion of infected individuals is small and the process is highly stochastic .",
    "epidemiologists need to know whether a disease will die out , and how many individuals are likely to be infected before the extinction , given certain fundamental probability distributions such as the distribution of number of secondary infections produced per infected individual .",
    "they also need to know how these parameters will change once control measures such as vaccination are introduced .",
    "some work has started in applying branching process - type arguments successfully to the mathematical modelling of disease transmission @xcite .",
    "however much work remains to be done in developing a mathematically rigorous methodology to understand impact of vaccines .",
    "branching processes have been applied to areas in biology such as the study of offspring distributions and the extinction of family surnames . however , there are issues that are particular to infectious disease epidemiology , such as the impact of vaccination on the branching processes .",
    "these pecularities necessitate an extension of branching process methodologies to the case of infectious disease transmission and vaccination . here , infectious disease transmission and vaccination are treated as a classic galton - watson branching process .",
    "let @xmath0 be the number of infected individuals in the @xmath1 generation of disease transmission , where @xmath2 .",
    "since we consider the early stages of disease transmission and the proportion of susceptibles is almost 1 , infected individuals do not co - infect the same susceptible individuals .",
    "an ` infected ' ( resp .",
    "` susceptible ' ) here means an individual who is infected ( resp .",
    "susceptible ) in the present generation .",
    "every infected individual has the same probability distribution of the number of individuals they infect , and these are distributed independently of one other .",
    "assume each infected in the @xmath1 generation generates @xmath3 new individuals in the @xmath4 generation .",
    "here @xmath5is a measurable function ( a r.v . )",
    "whose infected population distribution is @xmath6 i.e. @xmath7=\\theta_{i},\\ , i\\geq0.$ ]    let @xmath8 represents the number of infected by the @xmath9 individual in @xmath1 generation .",
    "these infected are account for the size of the population in the @xmath4 generation .",
    "then @xmath10 assume that each @xmath11 is _ iid _",
    "r.v.s i.e. @xmath12=\\pr\\left[n = i\\right]=\\theta_{i}.$ ] the size of the @xmath4 generation @xmath13 depends on the number of infected individuals in the @xmath1 generation , therefore @xmath0 satisfies the properties of a markov chain .",
    "we assume that @xmath14 , guaranteeing that there is one infected individual from which the epidemic can start .",
    "after one disease generation ( one discrete time interval ) , this individual has infected a further number of individuals as given by the probability distribution@xmath15 . by this time ,",
    "the original infected individual has also recovered ( or died ) from the infection .",
    "thus the first generation constitutes @xmath16 infecteds , which is the sum of the @xmath17 random variables each with a probability @xmath18 .",
    "the second generation constitutes @xmath19 infected and the process continues .",
    "we call this process an epidemic branching process ( ebp ) .",
    "@xmath20    @xmath20    let @xmath21 be the proportion of the infected individuals who infect @xmath22 individuals .",
    "hence , @xmath23 is the proportion of infected individuals who do not infect anyone before they recover or die .",
    "if @xmath24 , then @xmath25 for all @xmath22 and the process is not interesting , so we assume that @xmath26 . likewise if @xmath27 then @xmath28 , the probability of extinction of the virus after @xmath22 generations , will be clearly equal to 0 for all @xmath22 .",
    "hence , we assume @xmath29 throughout . clearly , @xmath30 for all @xmath22 .",
    "if the infection is extinct in generation @xmath22 , it will remain extinct for @xmath31 and all following generations .",
    "then , @xmath32 is a monotone increasing sequence , so we let @xmath33 . here @xmath34 is the probability that the infection will eventually die out in the population .",

    "@xmath38 is the sum of the probabilities of the @xmath39 distinct ways in which the infection can become extinct .    in the next section",
    "we introduce probability generating function @xmath40 for @xmath41 and prove results similar to the one discussed above on @xmath42 in broader way .",
    "we study uniform convergence properties and related consequences of @xmath40 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 the results on uniform convergence of @xmath40 provided in this work are not new because @xmath40 is a power series ( introduced in the next section ) .",
    "we study extinction probabilities _ with respect to _ the _ _ _ _ mean number of infectious individuals generated by starting @xmath14 .",
    "this mean number is defined as @xmath45 in the mathematical epidemiology literature , @xmath46 would be referred to as the basic reproductive number .",
    "the process @xmath47 is called supercritical if @xmath48 and the process is called sub critical if @xmath49 we have not seen rigorous mathematical treatment of the branching process for the spread of virus in the population ( except elementary branching process applications for understanding measles outbreaks @xcite and for virus hiv spread within the host cell dynamics@xcite ) .",
    "extinction probability results in the pre - vaccination ( i.e. without vaccination ) scenario are derived from branching process studies available on offspring distribution , surnames and other general branching processes analysis ( see for example , @xcite and fundamental results on uniform convergence can be seen in many classical analysis books ) .",
    "hence some results in section 2 do not bring new mathematics , but rather new applications . in section 3 , we bring novelty through theoretical arguments on ebp when vaccination is introduced in the population . by vaccinating the individuals , the resultant probability density functions of infection densities shifts to the left and extinction of virus is quicker .",
