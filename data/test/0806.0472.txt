    "the recent few years have witnessed a great devotion to exploration and understanding of underlying mechanism of complex systems as diverse as the internet @xcite , social networks @xcite and biological networks @xcite . as critical infrastructure , transportation networks",
    "are widely studied .",
    "examples include airline @xcite , ship",
    "@xcite , bus @xcite , subway @xcite and railway @xcite networks .",
    "maritime transportation plays an important role in the world merchandize trade and economics development .",
    "most of the large volume cargo between countries like crude oil , iron ore , grain , and lumber are carried by ocean vessels . according to the statistics from united nations @xcite",
    ", the international seaborne trade continuously increased to 7.4 billion tons in 2006 with a robust annual growth rate of @xmath2 per cent . and",
    "over 70 per cent of the value of world international seaborne trade is being moved in containers .",
    "container liners have become the primary transportation mode in maritime transport since 1950 s .",
    "liner shipping means the container vessels travel along regular routes with fixed rates according to regular schedules . at present",
    "most of the shipping companies adopt hub - and - spoke operating structure which consists of hub ports , lateral ports , main lines and branch lines , forming a complex container transportation network system @xcite .    compared with other transportation networks ,",
    "the maritime container liner networks have some distinct features : ( 1 ) a great number of the routes of container liners are circular .",
    "container ships call at a series of ports and return to the origin port without revisiting each intermediate port .",
    "it s called pendulum service in container transportation . while bus transport networks and railway networks are at the opposite with most of buses or trains running bidirectionally on routes .",
    "( 2 ) the network is directed and asymmetric due to circular routes .",
    "( 3 ) lines are divided into main lines and branch lines .",
    "main lines are long haul lines which involves a set of sequential port calls across the oceans .",
    "sometimes long haul lines call at almost 30 ports .",
    "branch lines are short haul lines connecting several ports in one region to serve for main lines .",
    "we construct the worldwide maritime transportation network ( wmn ) using two different network representations and analyze basic topological properties .",
    "our result shows that the degree distribution follows a truncated power - law distribution in the space @xmath0 and an exponential decay distribution in the space @xmath1 . with small average shortest path length 2.66 and high cluster coefficient 0.7 in the space @xmath1",
    ", we claim that wmn is a small world network .",
    "we also check the weighted network and find the network has hierarchy structure and `` rich - club '' phenomenon .",
    "centrality measures are found to have strong correlations with each other .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ construction ] , we introduce the database and set up the network using two different network representations . in section [ basicproperty ] various topological properties",
    "are studied including degree distribution , degree correlations , shortest path length , weight distribution and strength distribution etc .",
    "section [ structure ] discloses the hierarchy structure by studying the weighted and unweighted clustering and degree correlations .",
    "centrality measures correlations and central nodes geographical distribution are studied in section [ centrality ] .",
    "section [ conclusion ] gives the conclusion .",
    "we get the original data from a maritime transport business database named ci - online @xcite which provides ports and fleet statistics of 434 ship companies in the world .",
    "the data includes 878 sea ports and 1802 lines .",
    "the ports are distributed in different regions and we list the number of ports in each region in table [ listofports ] .",
    ".number of sea ports by major geographic region [ listofports ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         in fig .",
    "[ maritimeworldmap ] we plot the 25 most connected ports on the world map .",
    "they show unbalanced geographical distribution mainly located in asia and europe , including 13 ports in asia and middle east , 1 in africa , 9 in europe , 1 in north america and 1 in latin america .",
    "particularly they are located along the east - west lines .",
    "lines in maritime transportation are usually divided into east - west lines , north - south lines and south - south lines @xcite .",
    "the fact that 25 most connected ports in the world are in east - west trade routes represents rapid growth and large trade volume in europe - america , asia - america and asia - europe trade @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have presented an empirical study of the worldwide maritime transportation network ( wmn ) under different representations of network topology .",
    "we study the statistical properties of wmn and find that wmn is a small world network with power law behavior .",
    "there are strong correlations in degree - degree , strength - degree and betweenness - degree relations .",
    "central nodes are identified based on different centrality measures .",
    "based on the analysis of weighted cluster coefficient and weighted average nearest neighbors degree , we find that wmn has the same hierarchy structure and `` rich - club '' phenomenon with wan .",
    "we conjecture that this structure is related to optimal behavior both existing in air transportation and maritime transportation .",
    "so our future research direction is the evolution modeling of wmn using optimal behavior to reproduce real properties in wmn .",
