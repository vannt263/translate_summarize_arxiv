    "mass is a fundamental quantity of an astronomical object . in the case of a neutron star ( ns )",
    ", mass is important , among other aspects @xcite , as it gives us a clue to study the equation of state of dense matter beyond the nuclear density , which is still uncertain through theoretical studies or experiments on the earth ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "almost all the measurements of ns masses so far are limited for nss in binaries .",
    "an exception is for the nearby isolated ns rx j 185635 - 754 @xcite , where its radiation radius and gravitational redshift have been measured modulo detailed modeling of its atmosphere @xcite ( see also the comments mentioned in the sec . 4 of and fig . 3 there ) .",
    "since an isolated star may have a different evolutionary history from a star in a binary ( namely due to their mutual mass transfer ) , the former may follow a different mass function than the latter and hence it is interesting to measure masses of as many isolated nss as possible .",
    "this paper proposes a new method to measure a mass of an isolated rapidly rotating ns that emits gravitational wave ( gw ) .",
    "we expect direct detection of gws within the next decade @xcite .",
    "the second - generation gravitational wave detectors such as kagra @xcite , advanced laser interferometric gravitationalwave observatory ( aligo ) @xcite , and advanced virgo ( avirgo ) @xcite are under construction .",
    "conceptual studies of third - generation gravitational wave telescopes are also on - going @xcite .",
    "one of the most important family of gw sources for those gw detectors is a compact binary coalescence ( cbc ) .",
    "detection of gw from a cbc event enables us to measure masses of compact stars in the binaries to sub - percent level .",
    "a possibility is actively discussed where we can study internal structure of the compact stars ( if they are regular ones ) through the tidal disruption of the binary stars during the binary merger ( @xcite for a review ) . however , again , the estimates of masses possible from detection of gws from cbc events are only for stars in binaries .",
    "we here focus on another type of gw sources , namely , isolated rapidly rotating non - axisymmetric nss and show that we can estimate masses of isolated nss by detection of those sources with one of proposed third - generation telescopes , namely , einstein telescope ( et ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , our method proposed in this paper utilizes the fact that phase of gw from an isolated rapidly rotating compact star is modulated by the coulomb type gravitational field of the star itself .",
    "this logarithmic phase shift is well - known in quantum mechanics @xcite , and partly incorporated in the gw waveform from cbc @xcite .",
    "this coulomb type phase shift corresponds to the famous gravitational time delay ( or the shapiro time - delay when it is observed in a binary system ) . but this phase shift seems neglected so far in the context of the studies searching for gws from isolated pulsars .",
    "then our idea to extract mass @xmath2 of an isolated pulsar at distance @xmath3 from gw observation is as follows . in the case of gw ,",
    "the coulomb phase shift take a form of @xmath4 for gw with frequency @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "if we detect two gw modes at frequencies @xmath6 and @xmath7 from the same pulsar , we could find the mass by @xmath8 where @xmath9 . before examining the feasibility of this idea , we first mention whether a pulsar could emit continuous gw at ( more than ) two frequencies .",
    "a rotating tri - axial object with its rotational frequency @xmath10 emits gw mainly at frequency @xmath11 when the rotational axis of the object is aligned to the one of the principal axis of its moment of inertia .",
    "if the former axis is not aligned to any one of the latters and this object rotates as a rigid body as a whole , this object will freely precess and emits gw at frequencies close to @xmath10 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "when the former axis is not aligned to any one of the latters and this object has a pinned superfluid layer(s ) , jones proposed a possibility that this object could steadily rotate at a constant frequency and emits gw at frequencies close to @xmath10 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two scenarios @xcite and @xcite is that the latter does not freely precess and hence it shows no electromagnetic signature of free precession .",
    "observational evidences of existence of freely precessing nss are recently reported by makishima _",
    "@xcite where they found phase modulations in pulsations of the magnetar 4u 0142 + 61 and 1e 1547.05408 using the suzaku x - ray observatory .",
    "they interpreted that those phase modulations are due to free precessions of those objects .",
    "there are several other objects that show signatures of free precessions , but it is not clear that current theoretical understandings of ns interior structures allow a free precession sustainable long enough so that we have any practical chance to observe it at all ( see , e.g. , @xcite for discussion and references therein ) .",
    "this in turn means that the findings by makishima _",
    "et al . _ and further detections of freely precessing nss",
    "give us an insight onto the interior structure of nss and drive our theoretical understandings on it .",
    "indeed , majority of pulsars do not show any clear signature of free precession .",
    "however , jones pointed out that a ns may have a pinned superfluid .",
    "jones then advocated a theoretical possibility that a ns could rotate steadily even when the axis of the moment of inertia of its solid outer crust is misaligned to its rotational axis @xcite . as a result ,",
    "such a ns emits gw at two frequencies close to @xmath10 and @xmath11 without showing any electromagnetic signature of free precession .",
    "this proposal by jones motivates bejger and krlak @xcite to study a search method for gws from known pulsars at once and twice their spin frequencies .",
    "motivated by these observations and the theoretical proposal by jones , we here assume a pulsar that emits gw at frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath14 to study feasibility of our idea of estimating the pulsar mass using coulomb phase shifts . the gw radiation at the frequency @xmath15 is sometimes called a `` wobble mode '' or `` wobble radiation '' for a freely precessing ns . here",
    "we would like to include a non - precessing ns that emits gw at that frequency , we here call this mode `` the first harmonic mode '' while the gw at @xmath16 `` the second harmonic mode '' ( or `` the first overtone mode '' )",
    ". applications of our idea to gw modes other than the ones considered here or extensions to the case where multiple gw modes more than two are available should be straightforward .",

    "are presented in sec.[sec : conclusion ] . throughout this paper , we adopt the geometric unit system in which both the light speed @xmath17 and the gravitational constant @xmath18 are unity .",
    "in this section , we derive the explicit form of the gravitational phase shift for gw caused by the gravitational potential of the source itself . the derivation in this section",
    "is basically based on the section 2 in @xcite .",

    "motivated by this observation and to capture the dominant effect of the gravitational field of the source onto the gw phase , we express the full einstein equations including the source under the harmonic gauge condition in the following form , @xmath26 the effective energy - momentum pseudotensor @xmath27 and the differential operator @xmath28 are defined as    @xmath29 , \\\\   & \\tau^{\\mu\\nu } =    \\left(-g\\right ) \\left ( t^{\\mu\\nu } + t_{\\text{ll}}^{\\mu\\nu } + t_{\\text{m}}^{\\mu\\nu } \\right ) , \\\\    & t_{\\text{m}}^{\\mu\\nu }    = -\\dfrac{1}{16\\pi } \\left [ \\bar{h}^{\\mu\\alpha}{}_{,\\beta } \\bar{h}^{\\nu\\beta}{}_{,\\alpha }       + 2\\bar{h}^{0j } \\bar{h}^{\\mu\\nu}{}_{,0j } + \\bar{h}^{jk } \\bar{h}^{\\mu\\nu}{}_{,jk }      + \\left ( \\bar{h}^{00 } - \\dfrac{4m}{r } \\right ) \\bar{h}^{\\mu\\nu}{}_{,00 } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 denotes the landau - lifshitz pseudotensor @xcite and @xmath19 denotes the total mass of the source .",

    "@xcite then adopted slow motion approximation and expanded this green s function in @xmath55 and arrived at the gw waveform including the tail term which was first derived by blanchet and damour @xcite .",
    "they then pointed out that the dominant part of the tail term originates from the deviation of the true light cone from the flat light cone due to the gravitational potential of the gw source itself , which appears as the phase shift @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g+_finalform ] ) .",
    "since we focus on this gravitational phase shift for gws , we drop the @xmath57 term in the amplitude but retain the @xmath58 term in the phase up to the first order in our analysis .",
    "finally we note that this phase shift corresponds to the well - known gravitational time delay ( or the shapiro time delay in the case of a binary ) .",
    "the gw propagates along the true light cone of the curved spacetime , and so takes a slightly longer time to travel to the detector than it does in the absence of the source .",
    "let us now assume an isolated rapidly rotating ns with mass @xmath59 as a gw source .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , an isolated rapidly rotating ns would emit gws at distinct frequencies at the same time .",

    "inclusions of higher order mass multipoles or current multipoles , if necessary , are straightforward .",
    "in this section , we apply the gw waveform including the gravitational phase shift effect to an isolated rapidly rotating ns that emits gws at two frequencies , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "a non - axisymmetric ns rotating around its principal axis produces the quadrupole gw radiation with a frequency @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes the rotational frequency of the ns .",
    "however , the angular momentum axis of the ns does not generally align with its principal axis because of , for example , the strong toroidal magnetic field inside the ns @xcite . when the ns deviates from the spherical symmetry , the misalignment between the angular momentum axis and the principal axis in general leads to a free precession of the ns .",
    "it would also be possible that the ns steadily rotates at @xmath74 at the fixed rotational axis in an inertial frame if it has a pinned superfluid component inside it @xcite .",
    "those two kinds of nss radiate the gw with two frequency modes @xmath70 and @xmath71 which we call the first harmonic mode and the second harmonic mode , respectively @xcite .",
    "the gw waveforms in these two scenarios are generally different from each other for tri - axial nss @xcite . .",
    "interestingly , in the case of bi - axial nss , those two families of the gw waveforms take the same form ( shown e.g. , in @xcite ) , which we adopt in this paper to apply our result to both scenarios .",

    "note that the log - term appears in the gw phase due to the gravitational potential of the ns .      in this paper ,",
    "we take an example of gws from an isolated rapidly rotating non - axisymmetric ns to demonstrate the measurement accuracy of the ns mass .",
    "a ns would emit gws of several modes such as the first and the second harmonic modes mentioned in this paper , wobble mode if the spin axis of the ns precesses , @xmath87-mode and @xmath3-mode if the corresponding stellar oscillations are excited .",
    "if the initial gw phases of two modes at the ns are known , or the ratio of the two gw phases is equal to the ratio of the gw frequencies of the two mode , the ns mass can be estimated by subtracting the gw phase of one mode from the other with the ratio multiplied appropriately . in the case of the first and second harmonic modes considered in this paper ,",
    "this assumption is guaranteed because the both modes are generated by the deformation of the crust of the ns .",
    "multiplying @xmath88 by 2 subtracting eq .",

    "( [ eq : diff_phase ] ) indicates that the difference between the two modes separates the ns mass and the distance to the ns .",
    "therefore , the ns mass alone can be estimated by gw observations . however , the accuracy of the constant phase is typically of the order of @xmath90 for a signal to noise ratio ( snr ) 10 even in targeted searches for known pulsars where @xmath91 is well - known by electromagnetic observations .",

    "those objects are `` known '' in the sense that electromagnetic observations and/or the second generation detectors will have detected them before the search using third generation detectors .",

    "it can be detected with @xmath106 by a single second generation detector because the sensitivity of et is about an order of magnitude better than that of second generation one .",

    "the matrix @xmath144 is called the fisher information matrix and is defined by @xmath145 where @xmath146 denotes the noise - weighted inner product , and @xmath147 denotes the derivative of the gw signal with respect to the waveform parameter @xmath148 .",
    "for instance , the inner product between two time functions @xmath149 and @xmath150 is expressed by @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the one - sided powerspectral density of the detector . in this paper",
    ", we have adopted @xmath152 of et given in the table 1 of @xcite .",
    "when the frequency of the signal is nearly constant , it is convenient to introduce a new inner product @xmath153 where @xmath154 denotes the observation time @xcite . since the time scales of change in modulation amplitudes @xmath132 and @xmath133 are of the order of the time scale of the earth s rotation , the gw phase @xmath155 oscillates much more rapidly than modulation amplitudes .",

    "<S> such a time dilation effect holds also for photons and is often referred to as the gravitational time delay ( or the shapiro time delay ) . correspondingly , the phase of the gw from the ns shifts due to the coulomb type gravitational potential of the ns , and the resulting logarithmic phase shift depends on the mass , the spin frequency of the ns , and the distance to the ns . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ns mass can , in principle , be obtained by making use of the phase shift difference between two modes of the continuous gw such as once and twice spin frequency modes induced by a freely precessing ns or a ns containing a pinned superfluid core . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the measurement accuracy of the ns mass using monte carlo simulations and find that the mass of the ns with its ellipticity @xmath0 at 1 kpc is typically measurable with an accuracy @xmath1 using einstein telescope . </S>"
