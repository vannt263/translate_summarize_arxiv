    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are sources of tremendous energy that provide clues to the accretion history of the universe .",
    "defining a complete and reliable sample of agns is of great importance in our understanding of how black holes grow over cosmic time as well as the physical processes behind these powerful objects .",
    "x - ray emission is an efficient means of detecting energetic activity in distant galactic cores and is often used to find agn samples @xcite . however , this approach is less successful at finding sources hidden by extreme columns of gas and dust , and models of the observed hard x - ray background require larger numbers of agns than are currently observed .",
    "@xcite found that only 50% of the x - ray background is resolved at @xmath1 kev , and the missing component of the background is consistent in spectral shape with a population of obscured agns at redshifts @xmath2 with @xmath3 2 .",
    "these synthesis models predict that at 30 kev , the peak of the hard x - ray spectrum , the x - ray background is dominated by heavily obscured sources and obscured agns outnumber unobscured agns by a ratio of three or four to one @xcite .",
    "thus , the bulk of the accretion in the universe is taking place in obscured environments that are likely to be missed by x - ray selection methods , highlighting the need for a multi - wavelength approach to build an unbiased census of agns .",
    "mid - infrared and radio surveys provide a way of searching for these elusive obscured nuclei , as these wavelengths are much less affected by extinction and can penetrate through the dusty atmospheres surrounding the agn .",
    "x - ray obscured agns are often bright in the mid - ir as the dusty environment surrounding the accretion disk reprocesses incident x - rays from the central engine and re - radiates these photons at infrared wavelengths .",
    "efforts to select agn candidates with infrared data have mainly concentrated on using mid - ir color criteria ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or power - law selection techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite presented evidence of finding compton thick agn candidates ( @xmath4 ) by searching for sources with large mid - ir excess .",
    "successful attempts have also been made to find obscured agns with combined analyses of mid - ir and radio data sets .",
    "@xcite found a minimum 4:1 ratio of obscured ( compton thin and compton thick ) to unobscured agns in the _ chandra _ deep field - north ( cdf - n ) by analyzing sources with radio excess .",
    "@xcite found a 2@xmath53:1 ratio using a combination of mid - ir , near - ir , and radio flux density criteria in the _ spitzer _ first look survey ( fls ) and the subaru xmm - newton deep field ( sxdf ) .",
    "both results are within model predictions of the obscured agn ratio . here , we combine and compare the procedures introduced by these two radio / mid - ir selection techniques to find a sample of 72 agn candidates in the extended groth strip ( egs ) and use multi - wavelength data to cross - identify their active status . in particular , understanding the x - ray properties of the candidate agns is important to control any residual contamination by non - agns as well as to study their obscuration and thus put more constraints on the x - ray background . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt @xmath6 cold dark matter cosmology with @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the extended groth strip ( egs ) is an approximately 2  by 15  region centered on @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the region s high ecliptic and galactic latitudes make it ideal for studying extragalactic sources with little galactic contamination , attracting deep coverage of the field in all wavelengths from radio to x - ray .",
    "it is a unique field in its combination of size and depth : it is shallower but larger than the combined goods fields , and smaller but deeper than the cosmos field at most wavelengths .",
    "thus , the intermediate position of the egs in both depth and area makes it an ideal dataset for combining the agn selection techniques previously tested in different regimes . @xcite",
    "give a detailed description of the region and the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ) data sets .",
    "the radio data were observed at 1.4  ghz using the very large array ( vla ) with @xmath1318 hr of data per sky position and a resulting source sensitivity limit of 50 @xmath14jy @xcite .",
    "the data have a noise level of 10 @xmath14jy beam@xmath8 and a fwhm of @xmath15 .",
    "sources were defined by searching signal - to - noise ratio images using the sad detection algorithm ; the technique is outlined in @xcite .",
    "the infrared properties were found using instruments aboard the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ @xcite , with 1.2 ks observations from the multiband imaging photometer ( mips , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and 9.1 ks exposures from the infrared array camera ( irac , * ? ? ?",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "data were processed with the mips instrument team data analysis tool and the spitzer science center irac pipeline , and sources were identified using daophot .",
    "further details for the mips data are provided by @xcite and for the irac data by barmby et al .",
    "the 5@xmath16 limiting point - source flux densities of the infrared data are 83 @xmath17jy for the 24  mips band and 2 @xmath14jy for the 3.6  irac band .",
    "their fwhms are 5.9and 1.8at 24  and 3.6  , respectively .",
    "the radio and infrared catalogs were matched to each other using a 25 search radius .",
    "the overlapping vla and mips images result in a field of view of @xmath18 deg@xmath19 , with roughly 630 and 9,800 sources at 1.4  ghz and 24  , respectively . in this shared area",
    ", there are 482 sources with both 1.4  ghz and 24  detections ; these sources form the parent sample for our selection .",
    "this paper uses two radio / mid - ir selection techniques , one of which also requires use of the 3.6  data . due to a small offset in angle between the irac and mips images , the irac field does not extend as far north as the mips and radio fields .",
    "thus , only 325 of the sources detected in both 1.4  ghz and 24  are within the irac field of view ; 321 of these have 3.6  counterparts .",
    "( the remaining four sources are visible on the irac image but were not extracted by daophot . )    after selecting our candidates , we analyzed their properties using 200 ks x - ray data from the acis - i instrument on the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. the x - ray image is aligned with the irac field and thus does not completely cover the vla / mips shared area .",
    "data reduction methods are described by nandra et al .",
    "( 2007 in prep ) .",
    "we also utilize _ r _ band photometry covering the entire field to a 5@xmath16 limiting ab magnitude of @xmath1326.5 from the suprime camera on the subaru telescope ( s.  miyazaki 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "supplemental @xmath20 band photometry from the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( limiting ab magnitude = 24.2 at 8@xmath16 ; @xcite ) was used in a few cases where the subaru data lacked coverage . finally , we use redshifts obtained by the deep2 survey , available in two - thirds of the vla / mips shared field from the keck deimos spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the median redshift for the survey is @xmath21 ; redshift measurements for the candidate sources ranged from @xmath22 . because the optical fields are quite crowded , sources with multiple potential counterparts within 25 were checked by eye .",
    "two optical counterparts were thrown out because the match could not be determined unambiguously .",
    "two different samples of radio / mid - ir agn candidates were selected using two separate sets of criteria , as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the first method , which we refer to as `` @xmath23-selection '' , relies on the radio / infrared relation for star - forming galaxies and agns @xcite .",
    "recent findings have suggested that the relation may break down at high redshift @xcite , but @xcite show that the correlation holds to at least @xmath24 . their study compares observed 1.4 ghz with observed 450 and 850  flux densities , which at the redshifts of interest ( @xmath25 ) sample rest wavelengths in the radio near 5 ghz and in the far infrared near 150 and 300 .",
    "@xcite defined @xmath23 = log(s@xmath26/s@xmath27 and showed that @xmath28 for non - k - corrected normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "@xcite suggested that sources with strong radio emission relative to their 24  flux densities are likely to be dominated by agns rather than star formation and analyzed a sample of candidate agns by selecting sources with @xmath29 .",
    "of the 482 sources detected at both 1.4  ghz and 24  in our field , 51 have @xmath29 .",
    "we discarded three sources that had flux errors too large to yield convincing ratios of @xmath29 .",
    "a fourth source was discarded because the radio detection had only a marginal 24  counterpart ( @xmath30 ) and there were too many possible optical counterparts to be confident in the match .",
    "the @xmath23-selection only requires the use of the vla and mips parent sample . unlike the sample of @xcite ,",
    "we require all our candidates to have a detection in the 24  band in order to better compare with the second selection technique of this paper . because of the offset between the mips and irac images , 35% of these sources lie outside the irac field , and 20% are outside the _ chandra _ field",
    ".    the @xmath23-selected sample should include few if any starburst contaminants : adopting @xmath31 at @xmath32 from @xcite , a threshold of @xmath29 selects sources 3.4 standard deviations below the average @xmath23 value expected for starbursts .",
    "this difference may even be a conservative estimate , as @xcite find a higher @xmath33 for starbursts using stacked data in the _ spitzer _ wide field survey ( swire ) . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that at higher redshifts , the difference in @xmath23 should remain constant or increase when comparing liners , seyfert 2s and spiral galaxies to starburst systems .",
    "the @xmath23 values of ulirgs will fall closer to our selection limit with increasing redshift , though their values should remain above our cut of @xmath34 out to @xmath35 . at such high redshifts ,",
    "even our faintest candidates would have radio luminosities too high to be consistent with starburst systems , and we do not expect our sample to be contaminated with such non - agn sources .",
    "the second selection method , hereafter referred to as the `` flux - cut '' method , employs the 3.6  data set in addition to the 24  and 1.4  ghz parent population to identify an agn - rich sample .",
    "the selection is designed to find obscured agns near @xmath36 and is thus a good complement to the lower-@xmath37 @xmath23-selection technique .",
    "the redshift calculation comes from assuming the 3.6  emission will be dominated by the old stellar population and forming a 3.6  -@xmath37 relation @xcite , analogous to the @xmath38-@xmath37 relation for radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "the relation assumes the galaxies have an elliptical host galaxy , which would not be the case for potential starburst contaminants .",
    "however , comparing the relation with local galaxy templates revealed that the correlation ( and thus , the redshift assumption ) remained valid even for reddened ulirg templates .",
    "the flux - cut method is outlined in detail by @xcite .",
    "we adopted their flux limits :    @xmath39jy + @xmath40jy@xmath41mjy + @xmath42jy + the 24  selection was chosen to find a flux density limited sample of active galaxies ; a flux density of 300 @xmath17jy at @xmath43 corresponds to quasars of luminosity @xmath44 at rest - frame 8  . at these wavelengths ,",
    "dust extinction is negligible except in extreme cases . in agn",
    "unification schemes , a dusty torus surrounds the optically and x - ray bright accretion disk .",
    "dust particles absorb and re - emit these photons , and a torus viewed edge - on would therefore be optically / x - ray obscured but _ bright _ in the mid - ir . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that the agn fraction tends to increase as @xmath45 flux density increases . accepting only higher flux density sources",
    "should therefore improve our probability of finding agns .    at @xmath46 ,",
    "the mips criterion alone may select star - forming systems with strong pah features .",
    "the minimum radio flux density cut is designed to eliminate these starburst systems . using the lower limit of 100  @xmath17jy from @xcite rather than",
    "the 350  @xmath17jy limit of @xcite increases our sample size while still being high enough to avoid nearly all starburst contaminants . using the equations for star - forming rates from @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "if we assume that the 24  emission of 300  @xmath17jy arises solely from star - forming systems at @xmath46 , we would expect a radio flux density that is still an order of magnitude lower than 100 @xmath17jy .",
    "the upper limit of the radio criterion removes extreme radio - loud sources whose potential jets may complicate the analysis ; only one potential flux - cut candidate is omitted by this upper limit ( see figure 1 ) . from the parent sample of 482 sources ,",
    "184 fit these mips and radio flux criteria .",
    "the 3.6  criterion weeds out unobscured agns and corresponds to a rest frame wavelength of 1.2  at @xmath43 .",
    "dust extinction makes the near - ir emission of obscured agns much fainter than that of unobscured sources .",
    "requiring high 24  flux densities and low 3.6  flux densities focuses the sample on obscured types . out of the 184 sources that fit the 24  and 1.4  ghz criteria , 115 are within the irac field . of those ,",
    "the 3.6  criterion yields a final sample size of 28 flux - cut sources .",
    "we compared the radio/24  ratios of these sources with the values expected from local ulirg templates and analyzed their seds and multi - wavelength properties .",
    "the results suggested only 2 - 3 potential starburst candidates among the sources ; these few interlopers should not alter our results .",
    "we combined both of these techniques to arrive at our final sample .",
    "because we are likely probing different redshift regimes and obscuration levels between the two techniques , only three sources overlap between the 47 @xmath23-selected sources and the 28 flux - cut sources .",
    "our final sample thus contains 72 radio / mid - ir agn candidates ( see table 1 ) .",
    "thirty - seven of the 47 @xmath23-selected sources are within the _ chandra _ field ; 15 ( 41% ) have x - ray detections with poisson false probability @xmath47 ( corresponding to slightly above 3@xmath16 in gaussian statistics ) in at least one x - ray band . of the 28 flux - cut sources , 26 lie within the x - ray image , and four have x - ray counterparts ( 15% ) .",
    "( the detection rates are only 32% and 12% for the @xmath23-selection and flux - cut methods in the higher significance aegis - x catalogs ( nandra et al .",

    "they found an x - ray counterpart detection rate of 40% at poisson probability @xmath49 ( 5@xmath16 ) , and the rate rises to nearly 80% for probability @xmath50 ( 2@xmath16 ) detections .",

    "they were able to increase the detection fraction to 17% by fitting seds to filter out contaminants , a procedure we do not adopt here .",
    "as expected , deeper surveys are required to detect x - ray counterparts to greater completion .",
    "although the _ chandra _ data in the egs comprise the third deepest _ chandra _ survey to date , 70% of our sources lack counterparts at the 200 ks depth",
    ". this may be due in part to the relative depth of the _ spitzer _ data versus the _ chandra _ field ( see figure 2 ) . in the egs , over 50% of the x - ray sources in the field have mips counterparts , but only 5% of the mips sources have x - ray counterparts .",
    "however , some of the undetected sources have upper limits that are greater than the fluxes of the actual detected sources , and often lie on relatively shallow ( off - axis ) areas of the x - ray map .",
    "these sources would likely have been detected with deeper data or on - axis pointings .",
    "x - ray hardness ratios are often used to study agn type , as harder spectra generally indicate more obscuration .",
    "all four x - ray sources in the flux - cut method were detected only in the soft band , whereas 11 of the 15 sources detected with the @xmath23-selection method had both hard and soft band detections .",
    "two other @xmath23-selected sources were detected only in the soft band , one was detected only in the hard band , and the final source was barely detected in the full band but had neither hard nor soft band detections at our limits . excluding the source with a full band only detection , the @xmath23-selected sources have a mean hardness ratio of @xmath54 ( hr = h@xmath5s / h@xmath55s , where h = @xmath56 kev counts and s = @xmath57 kev counts ) .",
    "as measured by hardness ratios , one - third of the x - ray detected @xmath23-selected sources are obscured according to the division chosen by @xcite , who classify obscured agns as those having hr @xmath58 in the _ chandra _ deep field south .",

    "the general population of sources with both x - ray and radio detections are even harder with a mean hr @xmath64 . however , a lack of hard band detection is not necessarily an indication that the source has a soft spectrum , especially for faint sources at higher redshifts @xcite .",

    "the flux - cut sources are fainter by a factor of 10 in the soft band ( and not detected at all in the hard band ) .",
    "this weaker emission , coupled with the expectation that these flux - cut sources should be near @xmath46 , suggests that the sources might be too faint for hard band detections , and spectral fitting is necessary to determine their true spectral slopes .",

    "the mean hard band flux of the stacked galaxies is @xmath73 2s and the mean soft band flux is @xmath74 2s .",
    "these fluxes are near the detection limit of the 2ms cdf - n , and deeper observations in the egs would likely have detected more of these stacked sources .",

    "only three sources overlap in the two methods , since they are designed to probe different redshifts and obscuration levels .",
    "this selection is independent of typical selection techniques such as x - ray or optical identifications , and thus we can test the completeness of current agn samples by finding agns missed at other wavelengths .    agns are often defined via their mid - ir power - law behavior , optical broad lines , and x - ray detections .",
    "nineteen sources ( 30% ) in our sample have x - ray detections with poisson false probabilities @xmath102 at the _ chandra _ 200 ks depth .",
    "column density estimates of the x - ray detected sources indicate that even assuming @xmath32 , half of our sources would be obscured with @xmath68 2 . the obscuration fraction will increase with redshift .",
    "if we assume our sources are at @xmath69 , which is the mean value determined from the few sources with spectroscopic data , nearly all of the x - ray detected sources are obscured . among the x - ray undetected sample ,",
    "stacking techniques demonstrate low but significant levels of x - ray activity above the background emission .",
    "the stacked source has @xmath103 , which is slightly flatter ( harder ) than the general x - ray background .",
    "the relatively high x - ray detection fraction and the properties of the stacked source indicate that we are finding a population of moderately obscured , though not compton - thick , previously undetected agns .",
    "the rate of x - ray confirmation of agn status is a function of the depth of the observations , and future work in this area will benefit from recently awarded additional _",
    "pointings in the field .",
    "the radio / mid - ir selected sample also finds more sources separately defined as agns via their optical or infrared properties than a random selection from the parent sample .",
    "however , our sample is also distinct from agns found using these other selection techniques : less than 20% exhibit the irac power - law behavior expected of luminous agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and 38% show agn signatures in their optical spectra . table 1 summarizes the numbers of agns identified by each technique separately for the flux - cut and @xmath23-selected samples .",
    "accounting for the overlap in multi - wavelength agn identification for some sources , 60% of our candidates have not been identified as agns via optical spectra , irac power - laws , or x - ray detections .",
    "the selection criteria used here thus contribute to a more complete census of agns , and a variety of selection techniques , requiring study at all wavelengths , are required in order to find the least biased samples of agns .",
    "compared to our x - ray detection rate of 30% , @xcite detected 80% ( 40% ) of the candidates in their @xmath23-selected sample at @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) in the deeper cdf - n , while @xcite detected @xmath106 5% in the shallower sxdf with a flux limit of f@xmath52 2s .",
    "in general , the flux - cut method finds a greater proportion of agns not identified via other wavelengths than the @xmath23-selected sources .",
    "this may be due to a greater fraction of obscured sources in the sample , as indicated by their stacked signal being slightly harder than the @xmath23-selected stacked signal . also , the flux - cut sample is much fainter at x - ray and optical wavelengths and agn activity may be too faint to detect in x - rays ( either intrinsically , or due to larger redshifts ) or hidden by host galaxy light at optical wavelengths . however , it is also possible that the flux - cut sample simply has a higher rate of contamination from starforming systems , and thus a smaller fraction of confirmed agns .",
    "both of the selection techniques we apply find only sources that are either moderately radio - loud or occupy the bright end of the radio - quiet population @xcite .",
    "radio - loud sources are expected to make up only @xmath107% of the total agn population @xcite , so 80 - 90% of agns are undetected with these techniques .",
    "sixty per cent of our candidates remained undetected using other agn identification techniques .",
    "if we assume that under the unified model of agns , the central engine behaves the same for both radio - loud and radio - quiet sources , we can estimate that the same fraction of radio quiet sources are undetected by these other methods .",
    "this implies that half of the overall agn population has yet to be found , and novel techniques must be developed in order to obtain a complete sample of agns .",
