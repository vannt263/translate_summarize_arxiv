    "the realization of rovibrationally stable dense samples of ultracold diatomic molecules remains one of the major goals in the field of atomic and molecular physics . while cooling diatomic alkali molecules was seen as a logical next step following the optical cooling of atoms , many of the possible applications currently under investigation extend beyond atomic and molecular physics . testing fundamental symmetries based on high - precision spectroscopy of ultracold molecules @xcite or the attempts to detect the time variation of fundamental constants @xcite are examples of such applications .",
    "another one is ultracold chemistry , where the interacting species and products are in a coherent quantum superposition state and could be realized by controlling reactive collisional processes @xcite .",
    "important insights about new phases of matter could be gained from strong anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction between ultracold dipolar molecules @xcite .",
    "finally , ultracold polar molecules could also represent an attractive platform for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "many of those applications require dense samples of ultracold polar molecules in the lowest rovibrational state that makes them collisionally stable and long - lived .",
    "translationally ultracold ( 100 nk - 1 mk ) molecules are produced from an ultracold atomic gas by photoassociation ( pa ) @xcite or magnetoassociation ( ma ) @xcite . in a typical pa scheme",
    ", a pair of colliding atoms is photoassociated into a bound electronically excited molecular state that spontaneously decays , forming molecules in the electronic ground state . in magnetoassociation , a magnetic field is adiabatically swept across a feshbach resonance , converting two atoms in a matching scattering state into a molecule .",
    "both techniques produce weakly bound molecules in highly excited vibrational states of the ground electronic potential .",
    "such molecules have to be rapidly transferred to deeply bound vibrational states before they are lost from the trap due to inelastic collisions",
    ".    stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite has recently attracted significant interest as an efficient way to produce deeply bound molecules , starting from feshbach molecules @xcite .",
    "it allows to realize high transfer efficiency and preserve the high phase - space density of an initial atomic gas .",
    "in stirap , the laser pulses , coupling an initial and a final state to an intermediate excited state , are applied in a counter - intuitive sequence where a pump pulse is preceeded by a stokes pulse . during the transfer",
    ", the system stays in a `` dark '' state , _",
    "i.e. _ , a coherent superposition of initial and final states , preventing any losses that would otherwise occur from the excited state . by adiabatically changing amplitudes of the laser pulses",
    ", the `` dark '' state evolves from the initial to the final state , resulting in nearly 100% transfer efficiency @xcite .",
    "efficient adiabatic passage from the continuum requires laser pulses shorter than the coherence time of the continuum @xcite .",
    "the adiabaticity condition of stirap , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the transfer time , therefore implies a large effective rabi frequency @xmath6 for the pulses .",
    "in addition , dipole matrix elements between the continuum and the bound state are usually small , and so the pump pulse that couples the continuum and the excited state would require a very high intensity , which proves impractical .",
    "thus the previous stirap experiments @xcite , being restricted by the very short coherence time of the continuum , used a feshbach molecular state as an initial state .",
    "the small continuum - bound dipole matrix elements can be dramatically increased by photoassociating atoms in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance .",
    "it has been shown , both theoretically and experimentally , that the photoassociation rate increases in the presence of a feshbach resonance by several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this can be explained by considering that delocalized scattering states acquire some bound - state character due to admixture of a bound level associated with a closed channel , resulting in a large increase of the franck - condon factor between the initial scattering state and the final excited state .",
    "the recently proposed feshbach optimized photoassociation ( fopa ) technique @xcite relies on this enhancement to directly reach deeply bound ground state vibrational levels from the scattering continuum .",
    "consequently , photoassociation in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance is expected to increase molecular formation rate up to @xmath7 molecules / s @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we combine the approach used in fopa with stirap for reducing the required pulse intensity .",
    "we predict highly efficient transfer of an entire atomic ensemble into the lowest rovibrational level in the molecular ground state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we derive a theoretical model of a combined atomic and molecular system .",
    "fano theory is used to describe the interaction of a bound molecular state with the scattering continuum , represented as closed and open channel , respectively .",
    "the resulting continuum states are coupled by two laser fields to the vibrational target state in the ground state via the intermediate excited molecular electronic vibrational state . in section iii",

    "it will therefore require @xmath124 pairs of pulses to convert an entire atomic ensemble into deeply bound molecules .",
    "since only a small fraction of atoms can be transferred to @xmath8 by a pair of stirap pulses , a train of pulse pairs can be applied to photoassociate the entire atomic ensemble . to prevent excitation of molecules in @xmath8 by subsequent pulses",
    ", they have to be removed before the next pair of pulses is applied .",
    "this could be realized by applying , after each pair of stokes and pump pulses , a relatively long pulse resonant to a transition from @xmath8 to some other vibrational level in the excited electronic potential which decays spontaneously to a deep vibrational state in the ground electronic potential .",
    "this long pulse would optically pump molecules out of the state @xmath8 to deeper vibrational states in the ground electronic potential .",
    "it therefore has to be longer than the spontaneous decay time of the excited state .",
    "care has to be taken that the excited state does not decay back into the scattering continuum .",
    "this would empty the @xmath8 state and deposit molecules into ground potential vibrational states according to franck - condon factors before the next pair of pulses arrives . finally , after all atoms have been converted into molecules the recently demonstrated optical pumping for molecules method @xcite",
    "can be applied , which would transfer molecules from all populated vibrational states into the ground level @xmath125 .",
    "the optimal strategy is to actually choose an excited state that decays mostly to the @xmath125 level .",
    "this would allow one to avoid storing molecules in unstable vibrational states and using the optical pumping method .",
    "if such a state can not be directly reached from @xmath8 , a four - photon stirap transfer can be applied @xcite , which provides efficient transfer to deeply bound molecular states .",
    "it allows one to choose the final state @xmath8 , from which the excited state decaying predominantly to @xmath125 can be easily reached . in this case",
    "rotational selectivity can also be preserved , since only @xmath126 and @xmath127 states will be populated",
    ".    the total time required to photoassociate the whole atomic ensemble and transfer it to the @xmath125 level can be estimated as follows .",
    "as the numerical results show , adiabatic passage requires @xmath128 @xmath3s , the follow - up pulse emptying state @xmath8 can have a @xmath129 ns duration , if the excited state lifetime is tens of ns , resulting in the whole sequence @xmath130 @xmath3s .",
    "then the train of @xmath131 pulse pairs will take @xmath132 s. the final step , optical pumping to the @xmath125 level , requires @xmath133 hundred @xmath3s , so the overall formation time is @xmath132 s. given an illuminated volume @xmath134 mm@xmath135 and an atomic density @xmath136 @xmath119 the resulting production rate is expected to be @xmath137 molecules / s .",
    "this compares well with the recent experiment on stirap production of ground state krb molecules starting from the feshbach state , where the entire cycle including creation of feshbach molecules takes @xmath138 s @xcite .",
    "combining photoassociation and coherent optical transfer to molecular ground vibrational states can allow one to convert an entire atomic ensemble into deeply bound molecules , and to produce a high phase - space density ultracold molecular gas .",
    "we have analyzed photoassociative adiabatic passage in a thermal ultracold atomic gas near a feshbach resonance .",
    "the presence of a bound state imbedded in and resonant with scattering continuum states strongly enhances the continuum - bound transition dipole matrix element to an excited electronic state , thus requiring less laser intensity for efficient transfer . in the limit of a wide resonance",
    "when compared to the thermal spread of collision energies , the dipole matrix element is enhanced by the fano parameter @xmath67 .",
    "choosing a tightly bound excited vibrational state , @xmath67 can be made much larger than unity , resulting in the intensity of the pump pulse required for efficient adiabatic passage to be @xmath139 times smaller than in the absence of the resonance .",
    "we modeled the adiabatic passage using typical parameters of alkali dimers and found intensities and durations of stirap pulses providing optimal transfer .",
    "intensities of the pump pulse , coupling the continuum to an excited state , were found to be a few kw/@xmath140 , which is @xmath129 times smaller than without resonance .",
    "optimal pulse durations are several @xmath3s , resulting in energies per pulse @xmath138 @xmath3j for a focus area of @xmath141 mm@xmath142 .",
    "if the feshbach resonance is narrow compared to the thermal energy spread of colliding atoms , adiabatic passage is hindered by destructive quantum interference .",
    "the reason is that electromagnetically induced transparency significantly reduces the transition dipole matrix element from the scattering continuum to an excited state in the presence of the bound feshbach state . in the narrow resonance limit ,",
    "photoassociative adiabatic passage is therefore more efficient if the resonance is far - detuned .    due to low atomic collision rates at ultracold temperatures ,",
    "only a small fraction of atoms can be converted into molecules by a pair of photoassociative pulses . to convert an entire atomic ensemble , a train of pulse pairs can be applied .",
    "we estimate that @xmath131 pulse pairs will associate an atomic gas of alkali dimers with a density @xmath143 @xmath119 in an illuminated volume of @xmath141 mm@xmath135 in @xmath144 s , resulting in extremely high production rates of @xmath137 molecules / s .",
    "high transfer efficiencies combined with low intensities of adiabatic photoassociative pulses also make the broad resonance limit attractive for quantum computation .",
    "for example , a scheme proposed in @xcite can be realized , where qubit states are encoded into a scattering and a bound molecular states of polar molecules . to perform one and two - qubit operations",
    ", this scheme requires a high degree of control over the system , which our model readily offers .    finally , marrying fopa and stirap is a very promising avenue to produce large amounts of molecules , for a variety of molecular species .",
    "in fact , although we described here examples based on magnetically induced feshbach resonances , such resonances are extremely common , and can be induced by several interactions , such as external electric fields or optical fields . even in the absence of hyperfine interactions , other interactions can provide the necessary coupling , such as in the case of the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction in @xmath145cr @xcite .",
    "this research was partially founded by the national science foundation , army research office , and the u.s .",
    "department of energy , office of basic energy sciences .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss eqs.([eq : c1-new ] ) and ( [ eq : c2-new ] ) for various relative widths of the feshbach resonance @xmath81 with respect to the thermal energy spread @xmath63 of the colliding atoms .",
    "we first describe the case of a broad resonance , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the width of the feshbach resonance greatly exceeds the thermal energy spread ( @xmath146 ) , and second consider the opposite situation of a narrow resonance ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "finally , we briefly present the case where there is no resonance .      the typical thermal energy spread for colliding atoms in photoassociation experiments with non - degenerate gases",
    "is @xmath149 @xmath3k .",
    "the broad resonance case occurs for resonances having a width of several gauss ( @xmath134 mk ) , for which we have @xmath150 .",
    "a wide variety of systems exhibit broad resonances .",
    "for instance , they can be found in collision of @xmath117li atoms at 834 g for the @xmath151 channel ( @xmath152 g= 40 mk ) and in @xmath153li at 736 g for the @xmath154 channel ( @xmath155 g = 19 mk ) .",
    "we note here that these values of @xmath81 are slightly different than the  magnetic \" width @xmath156 usually given and based on the modelling of the scattering length",
    ".    the source function can be readily calculated from eq.([eq : s ] ) by noticing that the rabi frequency term can be set at @xmath157 corresponding to the maximum of the gaussian function in the integrand .",
    "using the function @xmath73 defined in eq.([eq : g ] ) , the result takes the form @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the source function without a resonance given below in eq.([eq : sorce - nr ] ) . strictly speaking",
    ", this expression is valid for @xmath160 , but since @xmath80 eq.([eq : s - wide ] ) is a good approximation for a wide range of detunings @xmath161 .",
    "the back - stimulation term ( [ eq : back - stimulation ] ) can be further simplified in the limit of a broad resonance . in this case",
    ", both @xmath162 and @xmath163 change on a time scale @xmath164 , _ i.e. _ , slowly compared to the decay time @xmath165 of the exponent .",
    "therefore , we can rewrite ( [ eq : back - stimulation ] ) as : @xmath166c_{2}(t){\\cal e}^{2}_{p}(t).\\ ] ] the system ( [ eq : c1-new])-([eq : c2-new ] ) in the case of a broad resonance becomes : @xmath167c_{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath168 is the continuum - bound rabi frequency in the absence of resonance .",
    "we also added a spontaneous decay term @xmath169 , assuming that the excited molecules dissociate into high energy continuum states and the resulting atoms leave a trap . from eq.([eq : s - wide ] ) , one can see that in a broad resonance case , the source amplitude is enhanced by the factor @xmath170 when compared to the unperturbed continuum case .",
    "this factor has a maximum at @xmath171 , with the corresponding maximum value @xmath172 for @xmath173 .",
    "this situation occurs when the width of the resonance is of the order of a few micro - gauss or less .",
    "examples of narrow resonances include @xmath117li@xmath174na at 746 g for the @xmath175 channel ( @xmath176 mg = 1 @xmath3k ) @xcite , or @xmath117li@xmath177rb at 882 g for the @xmath175 channel ( p - wave , @xmath178 mg = 1.3 @xmath3k ) .",

    "the coefficient @xmath182 , which is the ratio of the feshbach resonance width to the width of the thermal energy spread , gives the ratio of contributions from the bound state and the unperturbed continuum , respectively .",
