    "the infrared structure of massless quantum electrodynamics in three dimensions ( qed3 ) is an old problem  @xcite .",
    "like other three - dimensional theories , qed3 is plagued by infrared divergences .",
    "it is widely believed that these signal a ground state that is far from the perturbative vacuum .",
    "two possibilities have been entertained  @xcite .",
    "one is that the infrared physics of the theory is described by confinement of charge , with a concomitant dynamical mass for the fermions .",
    "the other is that dynamical charges screen the coulomb interaction , so that charges at large distances interact via a power law potential . in the first case",
    "the scale of the theory s physics is presumably set by the coupling @xmath1 , which has dimensions of mass . in the second case",
    ", there is no scale in the infrared physics , but rather an emergent conformal symmetry .",
    "a number of studies have concluded that confinement and mass generation occur if the number of ( four - component ) fermions , @xmath2 , is small .",
    "it is clear , on the other hand , that in the large-@xmath2 domain the theory is screened and conformal .",
    "estimates of @xmath3 , the critical value of @xmath2 that divides the two domains , have varied widely in various analytical approaches @xcite and lattice simulations @xcite ( for interim summaries see  @xcite ) .",
    "we can explore this question via the renormalization group , guided by our knowledge of four - dimensional non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "the running of the coupling @xmath4 is governed by the beta function , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the one - loop coefficient . upon defining a dimensionless coupling @xmath7",
    ", we have @xmath8 a form typical of a super - renormalizable field theory .",
    "depends on the renormalization scheme : it is not invariant under a perturbative change in scheme , @xmath9",
    ". hence we do not specify it further , until we adopt the schrdinger functional scheme below .",
    "since @xmath10 comes from screening by physical particles , it should be positive in any sensible scheme .",
    "] when @xmath2 is small , there is a region around @xmath11 where the running is dominated by the first term , which has the sign associated with asymptotic freedom in four dimensions . as a consequence ,",
    "the infrared running is towards strong coupling . when the coupling becomes large enough , but before the second term becomes important , a condensate @xmath12 forms .",
    "this generates a mass for the fermions , whereupon at sufficiently small energy scales the fermions drop out of the theory , leaving free photons .",
    "the running of @xmath1 stops .",
    "when @xmath2 is large , on the other hand , the one - loop term in has to be considered . with",
    "@xmath13 fixed , the one - loop term in is the exact beta function . ]",
    "the beta function starts out negative at small @xmath14 but the one - loop term then makes it cross zero at @xmath15 .",
    "this is an infrared - attractive fixed point .",
    "once the coupling runs there , a scale invariance sets in .",
    "there are no massive particles and indeed , since green functions behave as powers of distance , there are no particles at all",
    ".    there must be a value of @xmath2 , which we have called @xmath3 , that divides the two domains .",
    "for @xmath2 just below this @xmath3 , the one - loop term is significant : it make the beta function turn towards zero as @xmath14 grows .",
    "this only happens , however , at a strong coupling , and the condensate is triggered before @xmath14 actually reaches the zero of the one - loop beta function .",
    "then the fermions develop a mass and decouple in the infrared , as described for the small-@xmath2 case .",
    "these infrared scenarios are familiar from non - abelian theories in four dimensions . in an asymptotically free theory",
    "the one - loop term in the beta function is negative , while the two - loop term changes sign as the number of fermion flavors is increased  @xcite .",
    "the transition from confinement to conformality has been much studied , most recently by the methods of lattice gauge theory ( for surveys see  @xcite ) .",
    "the schrdinger functional ( sf ) method gives a non - perturbative definition of the beta function that lends itself to lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "originally designed for qcd @xcite , it has also been applied to gauge theories that are on the borderline between confining and conformal @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a study of qed3 with @xmath0 four - component fermions by this method .",
    "we first calculate and plot results for the beta function at fixed lattice spacing .",
    "these indicate that the beta function deviates from the one - loop form ( [ rg2 ] ) at strong coupling and does not cross zero .",
    "this is confirmed when we extrapolate to the continuum by two different methods . unless this trend is reversed at yet stronger couplings , our results imply that the @xmath0 theory is a confining theory with a mass scale .    as mentioned above ,",
    "more straightforward lattice methods have also been applied to qed3 .",
    "we note in particular the extensive studies of refs .",
    "this work has pointed towards @xmath16 .",
    "calculating mass spectra and the chiral condensate is then quite challenging in the @xmath0 theory , because of the strong finite - volume effects inherent in low dimensionality : if @xmath3 is nearby then the condensate ( if any ) could be very small and particle masses ( if any ) likewise . deciding whether these quantities are really nonzero requires simulation on very large lattices  @xcite .",
    "the strength of the sf method , on the other hand , comes from the idea behind the renormalization group .",
    "there is no need to control a large range of length scales in a given calculation , because the method relates nearby scales to derive the beta function .",
    "thus finite size turns from a hindrance to a basis for calculation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the purpose of this smearing is the suppression of lattice artifacts .",
    "it allows us to go to stronger couplings before encountering numerical instabilities  @xcite",
    ".    a further cancellation of lattice artifacts is offered by the clover term ( [ action-3 ] )  @xcite .",
