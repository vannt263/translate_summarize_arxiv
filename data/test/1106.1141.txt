    "there are suggestions that these blue shifts are indicators of the nascent slow solar wind @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the enhancement in the blue wings of line profiles are most prominent in loop footpoint regions , such as ar boundaries @xcite .",
    "the discovery of these asymmetric line profiles suggests the presence of a highly blue - shifted ( much larger than 20  km  s@xmath0 ) emission component besides the primary emission component , and thus provides a significant challenge to previous results and interpretations which are based on a single gaussian fit .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that this secondary emission component is associated with type - ii spicules @xcite or rapid blue - shifted events ( rbes , * ? ? ?",

    "the so - called rb ( red - blue ) asymmetry analysis @xcite is based on a comparison of the two wings at same velocity ranges , and detailed analysis indicates that both the speed ( 50 - 150  km  s@xmath0 ) and the relative intensity ( a few percent of the total emission ) of the secondary component are roughly consistent across a temperature range from 100,000 to several million degrees @xcite . through joint imaging and spectroscopic observations of the corona , @xcite and @xcite have suggested that the secondary emission component is caused by high - speed repetitive upflows in the form of upward propagating disturbances in euv and x - ray imaging observations .",
    "such disturbances were previously interpreted as slow mode magnetoacoustic waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is also a suggestion that they are warps in two - dimensional sheet - like structures @xcite .",
    "besides the rb asymmetry analysis , the double gaussian fit technique has also been used to resolve the second emission component from line profiles @xcite . @xcite and @xcite applied a rb guided double gaussian fit to spectra with a high signal - to - noise ratio and obvious blueward asymmetry .",
    "they used the velocity derived from the rb asymmetry analysis as an initial guess of the velocity of the secondary component .",
    "the algorithm undertakes a global minimization of the difference between the observed spectrum and the fit by allowing both primary and secondary component centroids to move by one spectral pixel ( @xmath130  km  s@xmath0 ) to the blue or red of the initial positions .",
    "the speed of the secondary component was found to be @xmath160  km  s@xmath0 in @xcite and @xmath1100  km  s@xmath0 in @xcite .",
    "they both found that the widths of the two components are similar .",
    "the widths of the two gaussian components were forced to be the same in the double gaussian fit algorithm of @xcite , who mentioned that the velocity of the secondary component is often as high as 200  km  s@xmath0 and that the primary component is also blue - shifted by @xmath110  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "however , they claimed that the double gaussian fit is a good approximation for only the fe  195.12 and fe  202.02 lines and that other lines are fine with a single gaussian fit . by applying a completely free double gaussian fit to spectral profiles of the fe  284 line , @xcite found that the secondary component usually contributes 10% to 20% to the total emission , is usually blue - shifted by @xmath140  km  s@xmath0 and twice as broad as the primary component , especially in loop footpoint regions .",
    "however , different settings of initial values and allowable ranges of the seven free parameters can lead to very different fitting results , and thus reasonable initial values and constraints to some free parameters are highly desirable when performing the double gaussian fit .    here",
    "we slightly modify the initially developed technique of rb asymmetry analysis and apply it to both artificial and observed spectra by the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard _ hinode _ , and demonstrate that the speed of the secondary component usually does not reach 200  km  s@xmath0 and that the widths of the two components are comparable .",
    "we then use parameters determined from the rb asymmetry analysis to guide the double gaussian fit to each spectrum that is observed to have an obvious blueward asymmetry .",
    "both the rb asymmetry analysis and the double gaussian fit yield consistent results .",
    "we also use imaging observations simultaneously performed by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard the solar dynamics observatory ( _ sdo _ ) to demonstrate that the propagating disturbances at ar edges are plasma upflows which are indeed responsible for the blueward asymmetries of line profiles .",
    "the technique of rb asymmetry analysis was first introduced by @xcite . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "we first interpolated the line profile to a spectral resolution ten times greater than the original one , then subtracted the blue wing emission integrated over a narrow spectral range from that at the same position and over the same range in the red wing .",
    "the range of integration was then sequentially stepped outward from the line centroid to build an rb asymmetry profile ( simply rb profile ) .",
    "the rb asymmetry for an offset velocity @xmath2 can be expressed as the following @xcite :    @xmath3    where @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 represent the velocity from the line centroid , the velocity range over which the rb asymmetry is determined , and the spectral intensity , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath4 is usually set as 20  km s@xmath0 . in our previous work",
    ", we used the single gaussian fit to determine the line centroid .",
    "the resulting rb profile can be normalized to the peak intensity derived from the single gaussian fit .    here",
    "we slightly modify this technique by using the spectral position corresponding to the peak intensity as the line centroid .",
    "the resulting rb profile is then normalized to the peak intensity of the observed line profile . in the following",
    "the rb profiles all refer to normalized rb profiles .",
    "the originally defined and modified techniques are designated as rb@xmath6 and rb@xmath7 , respectively . in the following we apply these two techniques to artificial spectra composed of two gaussian components to test the ability of the rb asymmetry analysis to resolve the secondary component .",
    "similar to @xcite , each artificial spectrum consists of a fixed primary component and a much weaker secondary component .",
    "however , to mimic the observed eis spectra , the gaussian parameters we used here are very different from those in @xcite . the spectral pixel size is set as 24 km  s@xmath0 , similar to that of the eis spectra at around 274 .",
    "the relative peak intensity of the secondary component with respect to the primary one can be set as any value below 30% , while in figure  fig.1 we only show the case of 20% . the gaussian width ( 1/e width ) of the primary component",
    "is set to be 56 km  s@xmath0 , a value comparable to the coronal line width ( including instrumental , thermal , and non - thermal width ) observed by eis . for the secondary component , three values of the width are chosen ( 28 , 56 , 112 km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "the spectral position of the secondary component is shifted by -20 , -40 , -60 , ... , -180 km  s@xmath0 with respect to the major component and they are shown as different colors in figure  fig.1 .",
    "after applying the rb@xmath6 and rb@xmath7 techniques to each artificial spectrum , we obtain rb asymmetry profiles of each spectrum .",
    "the same colors are used in the rb asymmetry plots of figure  fig.1 . in the third and fourth rows of figure",
    "fig.1 we plot the peak intensity , velocity and 1/e width derived from the rb analysis as a function of the velocity offset of the secondary component .",
    "as noticed by @xcite , when the width of the secondary component is considerably smaller ( 28 km  s@xmath0 ) than that of the primary one and the secondary component is centered at velocities lower than the gaussian width of the primary component , the rb@xmath6 asymmetry profile is blueward at low velocities and redward at higher velocities . the asymmetry profile reverses when the offset velocity of the secondary component is larger than the width of the primary component .",
    "here we find that the rb@xmath7 asymmetry profile is redward at low velocities and blueward at higher velocities when the secondary component is too close to the primary one . as the offset velocity increases to a value larger than the width of the primary component , the rb@xmath7 asymmetry profile is blueward at all velocities .",
    "we find that when the velocity offset is larger than the width of the primary component , the velocity , width , and relative intensity derived from the rb@xmath7 technique are very close to the true velocity and width of the secondary component .",
    "the rb@xmath6 technique does slightly worse but still can give relatively accurate values of the parameters .",
    "when the widths of two components are the same ( 56 km  s@xmath0 ) , no matter where the secondary component is centered , the rb@xmath6 asymmetry profile is redward at low velocities and blueward at higher velocities , and the rb@xmath7 asymmetry profile is blueward at all velocities . by comparing the velocity , width , and relative intensity derived from the rb techniques with the true parameters of the secondary component",
    ", we can still conclude that the rb techniques can provide relatively accurate estimate of the properties of the secondary component provided the offset velocity is larger than the width of the primary component .",
    "we notice that compared to the rb@xmath6 technique , the rb@xmath7 technique has a better ability to reproduce the parameters of the secondary component , especially when the offset velocity is smaller than twice the width of the primary component .",
    "the improvement is around 10 km  s@xmath0 in the velocity and width , and 4% in the relative intensity .",
    "when the secondary component is considerably broader ( 112 km  s@xmath0 ) than that of the primary one , the rb profiles show morphologies similar to the case of 56 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "however , both the rb@xmath6 and rb@xmath7 techniques can not reproduce an offset velocity smaller than 100 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the velocity derived from rb analysis is always larger than 100 km  s@xmath0 if the secondary component is twice as broad as the primary one .",
    "there is also a large discrepancy between the width derived from rb analysis and the true width of the secondary component if the offset velocity is smaller than twice the width of the primary component ( 112 km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "we notice that in all the three cases , the rb techniques can give an extremely accurate estimate of the velocity when the offset velocity of the secondary component is larger than 112 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we have varied the intensity ratio of the two components in the range of 5 - 30% and obtain basically the same results , except for the different values of the calculated relative intensities .",
    "one thing we have noticed from figure  fig.1 is that the rb technique tends to underestimate the value of the relative intensity of the secondary component at smaller offset velocities ( e.g. , 56 - 112 km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "this is especially the case for the rb@xmath6 technique which we used in our previous work . from the third row of figure",
    "fig.1 we can see that in the velocity range of @xmath156 - 112 km  s@xmath0 the relative intensity of the secondary component recovered from the rb@xmath7 technique is much closer to the real value ( -0.20 in figure  fig.1 ) , as compared to the rb@xmath6 technique .",
    "the underestimation of relative intensity might be improved by using the chi - square method @xcite .",
    "the fact that the calculated rb velocities and relative intensities obviously deviate from the real values when the offset velocities of the secondary component are smaller than the width of the primary component has an important implication for the development of future euv spectrographs .",
    "the eis instrument has a large instrumental width of @xmath135 km  s@xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which contributes almost half of the total line width .",
    "the interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris ) , which is scheduled to be launched at the end of 2012 , will have a much smaller instrumental width ( a gaussian width of @xmath15 km  s@xmath0 at 1400  ) and our rb technique should be able to accurately resolve the secondary component at smaller offset velocities .",
    "the very high spectral resolution ( @xmath13 km  s@xmath0 ) of the iris spectrograph will greatly reduce the error caused by the interpolation of line profiles .    in the following",
    "we pick out two ars and investigate properties of the secondary component from the spectra obtained by eis . since the modified rb technique , rb@xmath7 , has a better ability to accurately resolve the blueshifted secondary component as compared to the originally defined rb@xmath6 technique , here we mainly present results by appling the rb@xmath7 technique instead of the rb@xmath6 technique to the real data . a comparison between the rb@xmath7 and rb@xmath6 results for the 2010 september 16 observation",
    "( see the details of this observation in section 4 ) is presented in appendix a.",
    "the @xmath8 slit of eis was used to scan ar noaa 10938 from 18:12 to 20:27 on 2007 january 18 , with an exposure time of 30  s and a step size of @xmath9 .",
    "this data was previously analyzed by @xcite and @xcite for the purpose of investigating properties of asymmetric line profiles .",
    "@xcite mainly used the fe  274.20 and fe  284.16 lines which are formed around a temperature of 2  mk , while @xcite only focused on the fe  284.16 line . here",
    "we choose both lines for our study , but focus on the fe  274.20 line .",
    "@xcite mentioned that the fe  284.16 line is blended with al  284.03 and that the latter usually contributes no more than 5% to the deviation from a single gaussian profile .",
    "however , as we will discuss later , in some locations the blend can greatly complicate the asymmetries of line profiles .",
    "the fe  274.20 line is also a strong line and it is blended with si  274.18 .",
    "the blend is much weaker than fe  274.20 and can safely be ignored in active region conditions @xcite .",
    "moreover , this blend is very close ( less than 1 spectral pixel ) to the line center of fe  274.20 and thus it should not have an important influence on the results of our rb asymmetry analysis and gaussian fit .",
    "further confidence is given by the highly similar behavior of the line moments and profile asymmetries between fe  274.20 and the weaker fe  264.78 line in most ars we analyzed ( see appendix b ) , although the fe  264.78 line is usually noisier than fe  274.20 .",
    "the ssw routine _ eis_prep.pro _ was applied to correct and calibrate the eis data .",
    "this includes ccd pedestal and dark current subtraction , cosmic ray removing , warm and hot pixels identification , absolute calibration , error estimation , and so on .",
    "the effects of slit tilt and orbital variation ( thermal drift ) were estimated by using the ssw routine _ eis_wave_corr.pro _ and removed from the data .",
    "after that , a running average over 5 pixels along the slit and 3 pixels across the slit was applied to the spectra to improve the signal to noise ratio .    as a common practice ,",
    "a single gaussian fit was applied to each spectrum and figure  fig.2(a)-(c ) show the spatial distributions of the gaussian parameters for fe  274.20 .",
    "figure  fig.2(d ) shows the map of reduced @xmath10 for the fit .",
    "the reduced @xmath10 is defined as the following ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 denote the observed spectral radiance , fitted spectral radiance , and measurement error calculated by using the ssw routine _ eis_prep.pro _ ( mainly poisson error ) , respectively . here",
    "@xmath15 represents the spectral position and the summation is performed over all the @xmath16 spectral positions .",
    "the degree of freedom is given by @xmath17 and equals to 4 or 7 for a single or double gaussian fit .",
    "we assume zero shift of the profile averaged over the entire observation region .",
    "we can see that the loop footpoint regions , or boundaries of the ar , are characterized by a blueshift of @xmath120 km  s@xmath0 and an enhancement of the line width , a well - known phenomenon in the hinode era ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , the goodness of the fit , the @xmath10 is also clearly enhanced mainly in loop footpoint regions , indicating an obvious deviation from a single gaussian profile there ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that the definition of @xmath10 in @xcite is not correct and that it is probably a typographic error .",
    "we applied the modified rb technique rb@xmath7 to each spectrum and calculated the average relative intensity in the velocity interval of 60 - 110  km  s@xmath0 from the rb asymmetry profile .",
    "figure  fig.2(h ) shows the spatial distribution of this average rb asymmetry . here",
    "a negative / positive value indicates an enhancement of the blue / red wing in this velocity interval .",
    "we can see that the blueward asymmetry is most prominent at loop footpoint regions , generally coincident with the blueshift , width enhancement , and @xmath10 enhancement . for further analysis , we only selected those locations where this average rb asymmetry is smaller than -0.05 ( obvious blueward asymmetry ) and the signal to noise ratio of the profile ( defined as the ratio of the peak and background intensities ) is larger than 5 .",
    "we have to mention that such a cutoff excludes the analysis of spectra in the ar core and edges where the magnetic field lines largely incline with respect to the line of sight , since an inclination of the magnetic field line usually leads to a smaller offset velocity of the secondary component in the line of sight direction , which would reduce the value of the relative intensity derived from the rb technique ( see figure  fig.1 ) .",
    "figure  fig.2(e)-(g ) show the peak relative intensity , velocity , and 1/e width derived from rb@xmath7 asymmetry profiles at these locations .",
    "the distributions of these three parameters are presented as the red histograms in figure  fig.6(a)-(c ) .    in figure",
    "fig.3 we show the scatter plots of the relationship between doppler shift / gaussian width derived from the single gaussian fit and the peak relative intensity derived from rb@xmath7 asymmetry profiles for fe  274.20 . here only data points with blue shift at those selected locations are shown .",
    "a clear correlation is found in each of the two panels in figure  fig.3 .",
    "such a correlation strongly suggests that the clear blue shift and enhanced line width in the loop footpoint regions are related to , or caused by the blueward asymmetries .",
    "we can simply imagine a faint high - speed upflow superimposed on a strong and almost stationary ( or slightly shifted ) background in the line of sight .",
    "such a scenario would naturally lead to a blueward asymmetric line profile . and",
    "a single gaussian fit to the total emission line profile would result in a blueshift and enhanced line width , as compared to the line profile of the background emission - a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite .",
    "so it is clear that the blue shift at ar boundaries , which was reported in many previous investigations @xcite , is actually a composite effect of at least two emission components and can not reflect the real physical process @xcite .",
    "some authors claim that the blue shifts derived from the single gaussian fit at ar boundaries are indicators of the nascent slow solar wind @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the wind speed must have been largely underestimated if the source of the mass supply to the solar wind is the secondary component , or overestimated if the primary component dominates the mass supply to the solar wind .",
    "our results also suggest that the enhanced line width can be the result of the superposition of different emission components with different velocities and is not necessarily related to the increase in the alfvn wave amplitude @xcite .",
    "we think that both the inhomogeneities of flow velocities and alfvn waves may contribute to the observed non - thermal width of an emission line , and that caution must be taken when interpreting the non - thermal width as purely cased by alfvn waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from figure",
    "fig.6(a ) we can see that the distribution of the intensity ratio ( relative intensity of the secondary component ) peaks around 0.07 but can reach as high as 0.3 .",
    "this is generally consistent with previous result that the blueward excess emission is often a few percent of the total emission , which is based on the rb@xmath6 technique ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while @xcite found a relative intensity of some 10% to 20% based on his free double gaussian fit",
    ".    as mentioned above , when the width of the secondary component is not considerably larger than that of the primary one , the rb@xmath7 technique can provide an accurate estimate of the gaussian parameters of the secondary component provided the offset velocity is larger than the width ( @xmath156 km  s@xmath0 ) of the primary component .",
    "as seen from figure  fig.6(b ) , the rb@xmath7 velocity seldom reaches 100 km  s@xmath0 and its distribution peaks at @xmath175 km  s@xmath0 . such a result would exclude the possibility of a very broad secondary component , as claimed by @xcite based on a free double gaussian fit",
    "this is because the velocity derived from rb analysis is always larger than 100 km  s@xmath0 when the secondary component is twice as broad as the primary one ( see figure  fig.1 ) . in figure",
    "fig.6(c ) we can see that the rb@xmath7 width is usually smaller than 60 km  s@xmath0 and larger than 35 km  s@xmath0 , and that its distribution peaks around 50 km  s@xmath0 , which is also not consistent with what we expect if the secondary component is twice as broad as the primary one . from the last panel of figure",
    "fig.1 we can see that the rb@xmath7 width is always larger than 60 km  s@xmath0 in such a case . from figure",
    "fig.1 we can also see that when the width of the secondary component is considerably smaller ( 28 km  s@xmath0 ) than that of the primary one , the rb@xmath7 width is always smaller than 35 km  s@xmath0 , which is not consistent with the observed histogram in figure  fig.6(c ) .",
    "these inconsistencies strongly suggest that the secondary component can not be considerably broader or narrower than the primary one .",
    "the widths of the two components should be comparable .",
    "this conclusion implies that the assumption of the same width of the two components in the double gaussian fit algorithm of @xcite is reasonable .",
    "the velocity distribution presented in figure  fig.6(b ) is not consistent with the scenario of a very high - speed ( @xmath1200 km  s@xmath0 ) secondary component , as suggested by @xcite after analyzing another data set .",
    "as seen from figure  fig.1 , the velocity derived from the rb@xmath7 technique is extremely close to ( usually less than 5 km  s@xmath0 ) the true velocity of the secondary component when the latter is larger than 112 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "if very large velocities exist , the rb@xmath7 technique should yield such large numbers of velocities .",
    "however , the observed velocity derived by using the rb@xmath7 technique seldom reaches higher than 150 km  s@xmath0 , indicating that the velocity of the secondary component in our observation can not be as high as 200 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we have to mention that the magnitude of velocity also depends on the viewing angle .",
    "however , in loop footpoint regions usually a large portion of the magnetic field lines are almost vertical so that the line of sight effect should not be very significant at disk center .",
    "we also applied the rb asymmetry analysis to the data analyzed by @xcite and found larger velocities ( @xmath195 km  s@xmath0 ) of the secondary component in that ar ( see appendix c ) .",
    "but still the velocity seldom reaches 200 km  s@xmath0 .      following the initial idea of using the rb@xmath6 analysis result to guide double gaussian fit @xcite",
    ", we designed a similar but modified algorithm .",
    "the peak intensity , velocity , and width derived from a single gaussian fit were used as the initial guess of those parameters of the primary gaussian component .",
    "the single gaussian background was also used as the initial value of the double gaussian background .",
    "meanwhile , we used the peak intensity and velocity obtained through the rb@xmath7 analysis as the initial values of the same parameters of the secondary gaussian component .",
    "the width of the secondary component was initially set as the same as the primary component . during the iterations , we allowed all the three intensities ( peak intensities of the two components and the background intensity ) to vary within the range of 75%-125% of the corresponding initial values .",
    "the velocity was allowed to move to the blue or red of the initial position by one spectral pixel ( @xmath124  km  s@xmath0 at 274 ) for the primary component and two pixels for the secondary component .",
    "we also allowed the width to increase or decrease by one spectral pixel for the primary component and two pixels for the secondary component .",
    "the algorithm undertook a global minimization of the difference between the observed and fitted spectrum .",
    "we present several examples of the observed and fitted profiles of both the fe  274.20 and fe  284.16 lines in figure  fig.4 .",
    "the profiles in figure  fig.4(a ) & and ( b ) are the profiles averaged respectively over region 1 and 2 marked in figure  fig.2 . by comparing the observed profiles with the different fitting profiles , we can clearly see the better performance of the double gaussian fit and the deviations of the observed profiles from the single gaussian fits .",
    "after the double gaussian fit , we took the velocity of the primary component as the line centroid and calculated the rb asymmetry profile ( here rb@xmath18 ) .",
    "the lower panels of figure  fig.4 show the three rb asymmetry profiles ( rb@xmath6 , rb@xmath7 , rb@xmath18 ) .",
    "we can see that rb@xmath7 and rb@xmath18 show similar behaviors and values of the three parameters are also very close .",
    "it is known that the fe  284.16 line is blended with al  284.03 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter is sitting at @xmath1150  km  s@xmath0 away from the spectral position of fe  284.16 so that this blend is potentially contaminating the blue wing of the line and may complicate the rb analysis and gaussian fit .",
    "for example , the line profiles in both figure  fig.4(a ) and ( b ) were obtained around loop footpoint regions ( marked in figure  fig.2 ) .",
    "the magnitude of asymmetry is comparable in both the fe  274.20 and fe  284.16 line profiles shown in figure",
    "fig.4(a ) , indicating that the blend al  284.03 can be ignored .",
    "however , in figure  fig.4(b ) we see a @xmath12% blueward asymmetry in fe  274.20 but a @xmath116% blueward asymmetry in fe  284.16 .",
    "since the two lines have similar formation temperatures , the completely different magnitude of asymmetries in the two lines strongly suggests that the bump at the blue wing of fe  284.16 is dominated by the blend al  284.03 .",
    "therefore , we focus on the fe  274.20 line instead of fe  284.16 which was used by @xcite .",
    "we then applied the rb@xmath7 guided gaussian fit and rb@xmath18 analysis to all spectra of fe  274.20 with obvious blueward asymmetries and large signal to noise ratio .",
    "we present the spatial distributions of the three gaussian parameters of both components in figure  fig.5 .",
    "in addition , the intensity ratio and velocity difference of the two components are also shown in figure  fig.5 .",
    "we found that in most locations the primary component is slightly blue shifted ( @xmath110  km  s@xmath0 ) , a result also found by @xcite , who interpreted it as the nascent slow solar wind from ar boundaries @xcite . while for the secondary component",
    ", the velocity is largely blue shifted ( @xmath180  km  s@xmath0 ) at almost all locations .",
    "the maps of parameters derived from rb@xmath18 asymmetry profiles are very similar to those derived from rb@xmath7 and thus are not shown here .",
    "histograms of the intensity ratio ( relative intensity ) , velocity difference ( velocity ) , and gaussian width of the secondary component as derived from double gaussian fit and rb asymmetry analysis ( rb@xmath7,rb@xmath18 ) are presented in figure  fig.6 .",
    "we can see that they are very similar , especially rb@xmath7 and rb@xmath18 .",
    "the intensity ratio peaks around 0.07 and can also reach as high as 0.3 . for rb@xmath7 and rb@xmath18",
    ", the velocity and width both have a narrow distribution which peaks at @xmath175  km  s@xmath0 and @xmath150  km  s@xmath0 , respectively . while for the double gaussian fit , most of the width values are still much smaller than @xmath1100  km  s@xmath0 and the width distribution peaks slightly higher .",
    "the velocity difference is usually in the range of 50 - 100  km  s@xmath0 , but the double gaussian fit algorithm also produces some relatively small values of velocity difference ( 10 - 50  km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "however , these relatively small blue shifts are found at only a few locations and they are not prevalent .",
    "the @xmath10 value of the double gaussian fit is usually smaller than unity - similar result was also found by @xcite , who attributed it to the overestimation of the measurement error . from figure",
    "fig.6(d ) we can see that the @xmath10 ratio between the double and single gaussian fit is usually less than 0.5 in the regions characteristic of obvious blueward asymmetries .",
    "such a result indicates that the double gaussian fit does at least two times better than the single gaussian fit for these asymmetric line profiles .",
    "it is likely that even more components , e.g. , a component from cooling downflows , might be present in the observed emission .",
    "however , a reliable decomposition of these additional components can not be made due to the relatively large instrumental width and modest spectral resolution of eis . with the upcoming iris data",
    ", we may be able to resolve more coronal emission components .",
    "the other observation was performed by eis on 2010 september 16 , with simultaneous observations by aia .",
    "the eis instrument scanned noaa ar 11106 from 10:38 to 11:57 ut .",
    "the @xmath19 slit was used for the observation , with a 60  s exposure .",
    "after standard correction and calibration of the eis data , a running average over 5 pixels along the slit and 3 pixels across the slit was applied to the spectra to improve the signal to noise ratio .",
    "four relatively strong and clean emission lines in the spectral window were selected for our study : si  275.35 , si  258.37 , fe  202.04 , and fe  274.20 .",
    "their formation temperatures are log(_t_/k)=5.8 , 6.1 , 6.2 , and 6.3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "but we will mainly concentrate on the hottest strong line , fe  274.20 .",
    "a single gaussian fit was first applied to each spectrum to derive the line intensity , centroid and gaussian width . by assuming the average doppler shift of each line is zero over the entire region ,",
    "we calculated the doppler shift from the line centroid for each spectral profile . maps of the gaussian parameters and @xmath10 for fe  274.20 are presented in figure  fig.7(a)-(d ) .",
    "again , we clearly see that the loop footpoint regions , or boundaries of the ar , are characterized by a blueshift of @xmath120 km  s@xmath0 and an enhancement of the line width .",
    "the deviation from a single gaussian profile , which is quantified by the enhancement of @xmath10 , is also clearly seen in the loop footpoint regions . the si  258.37 and fe  202.04 lines reveal basically the same structures in the maps of gaussian parameters .",
    "the cool line si  275.35 shows prominent redshifts in the fan regions ( not shown here ) , a phenomenon found also by @xcite .",
    "such redshifts could be the downflows after cooling of the high - speed upflows and evidence for the mass circulation in coronal loops @xcite .",
    "similarly to before , we applied the rb@xmath7 technique to each spectrum and calculated the average relative intensity in the velocity interval of 60 - 110  km  s@xmath0 from the rb asymmetry profile .",
    "figure  fig.7(h ) shows the spatial distribution of this average rb asymmetry .",
    "it is clear that the blueward asymmetry is most prominent at the two edges of the ar , generally coincident with the enhancement of blueshift , line width , and @xmath10 .",
    "however , the blueward asymmetry is clearly not only present at the ar edges , but also existing in other plage / loop footpoint regions .",
    "for example , the tongue - like patch ( x=@xmath20,y=@xmath21 ) of blueward asymmetries in figure  fig.7(h ) seems to be coincident with moss and it is not a typical outflow region .",
    "the fact is that simple magnetic field structures which are aligned with the line of sight are often not present in ar cores so that the secondary component there is often not revealed as clear blueward asymmetries of line profiles .",
    "an obvious correlation between the doppler shift / gaussian width derived from single gaussian fit and peak relative intensity derived from rb@xmath7 asymmetry profiles is found in figure  fig.8 , suggesting that the blueshift and enhanced line width are caused by the high - speed secondary emission component and that the single gaussian fit can not accurately reflect the real physical process here . in the following , only those pixels with obvious blueward asymmetry ( the average rb asymmetry in 60 - 110  km  s@xmath0 smaller than -0.05 ) and significant signal to noise ratio ( larger than 5 ) were selected .",
    "clearly , such a cutoff excludes the analysis of spectra in the ar core and edges where the magnetic field lines make large angles relative to the line of sight .",
    "the peak relative intensity , velocity , and 1/e width derived from rb@xmath7 asymmetry profiles of fe  274.20 at these pixels are shown in figure  fig.7(e)-(g ) .",
    "the distributions of these three parameters are shown as the red histograms in figure  fig.11(a)-(c ) and they are very similar to those in figure  fig.6 .",
    "the only obvious difference is perhaps the slightly larger peak velocity and gaussian width . in the 2007 january 18 observation , the velocity and width peak at @xmath175  km  s@xmath0 and @xmath150  km  s@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "but in the 2010 september 16 observation , the velocity peaks at @xmath185  km  s@xmath0 and the width peaks at @xmath160  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the major part of the velocity distribution is still on the left side of 100 km  s@xmath0 in the 2010 september 16 observation , which is not consistent with the scenario of a considerably broader secondary component @xcite .",
    "the scenario of a considerably narrow secondary component can also be excluded since the rb@xmath7 width is almost always larger than 35 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "similar to the 2007 january 18 observation , the rb@xmath7 velocity in this recent observation also seldom reaches higher than 150 km  s@xmath0 , indicating that the line of sight velocity of the secondary component is unlikely to be as high as 200 km  s@xmath0 in this observation .",
    "so with the rb asymmetry analysis ( particularly rb@xmath7 ) , we can conclude that the secondary emission component , which is usually less than 20% and often a few percent of the primary one in intensity , has a speed around @xmath180  km  s@xmath0 and a width comparable to the primary component .      the same algorithm of rb@xmath7 guided double gaussian fit was adopted to the asymmetric profiles obtained in the 2010 september 16 observation .",
    "several examples of the observed and fitted line profiles are presented in figure  fig.9 . in figure",
    "fig.9(a ) we show profiles of four emission lines averaged over region 1 which is marked in figure  fig.7 .",
    "blueward asymmetries and deviations from single gaussian profiles are clearly present in all of the four lines .",
    "the double gaussian algorithm yields a reasonably good fit to the observed spectra .",
    "this spatial average is necessary because individual profiles of the si  275.35 and si  258.37 lines are too noisy to allow reliable gaussian fits and rb asymmetry analysis in the ar boundaries .",
    "we find that the relative intensity and velocity of the secondary component stay relatively stable across the temperature range of log(_t_/k)=5.8 - 6.3 , consistent with the scenario of multi - thermal high - speed upflows , as suggested by our previous work @xcite .",
    "the clear presence of blueward asymmetry of the cool si  275.35 line is consistent with the finding of @xcite .",
    "compared to other lines , the si  275.35 line reveals a smaller velocity ( @xmath165  km  s@xmath0 ) of the secondary component .",
    "one possible reason could be that the si  275.35 line reflects emission from much cooler plasmas so that its line profiles are complicated by cooling downflows ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "fe  274.20 line profiles at four single pixels ( without spatial average ) are presented in figure  fig.9(b)-(e ) .",
    "the secondary component resolved by the double gaussian fit has different relative intensity and velocity .",
    "the magnitude of velocity is likely to be related to the viewing angle of the upflows .",
    "if the magnetic field lines associated with the upflows make a smaller angle with respect to the line of sight , the observed velocity should be closer to the real velocity .",
    "the location of the profile presented in figure  fig.9(b ) is in a weak emission region surrounded by hot loops .",
    "this weak emission region might be related to less compact ( larger ) loops or open field lines which are usually more vertical at lower heights compared to compact and smaller loops .",
    "this may explain the large value of velocity ( @xmath1120  km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "the gaussian widths of the two components are generally comparable in all these four cases .",
    "the rb@xmath18 profiles were then calculated by taking the velocity of the primary component as the line centroid . in figure",
    "fig.9 we also show the three rb asymmetry profiles ( rb@xmath6 , rb@xmath7 , rb@xmath18 ) for the corresponding spectra .",
    "the parameters of the secondary component obtained through rb@xmath7 and rb@xmath18 techniques are usually close to those obtained by using the double gaussian fit .",
    "the rb@xmath7 guided double gaussian fit and rb@xmath18 analysis were then applied to all spectra of fe  274.20 with obvious blueward asymmetries .",
    "figure  fig.10 shows the spatial distributions of the three gaussian parameters of both components as well as the intensity ratio and velocity difference of the two components .",
    "again , we found that the primary component is usually slightly blue shifted by @xmath110  km  s@xmath0 in this observation .",
    "the velocity of the secondary component is blue shifted by much larger values .",
    "the maps of parameters derived from rb@xmath18 asymmetry profiles are very similar to those derived from rb@xmath7 , which have been presented in figure  fig.7 and thus are not shown here .",
    "structures on the maps of rb@xmath7 peak relative intensity , velocity , and width shown in figure  fig.7 generally coincide with those on the maps of intensity ratio , velocity difference , and secondary component width as presented in figure  fig.10 , indicating that both the rb@xmath7 technique and rb@xmath7 guided double gaussian fit are able to extract the parameters of the secondary component .    figure",
    "fig.11(a)-(c ) shows the distributions of the intensity ratio ( relative intensity ) , velocity difference ( velocity ) , and gaussian width of the secondary component as derived from double gaussian fit and rb asymmetry analysis ( rb@xmath7,rb@xmath18 ) .",
    "for each of the parameters , the three histograms are very similar .",
    "all these histograms show no big difference from those presented in figure  fig.6 , except the slightly larger peak velocity and width .",
    "the velocity of the secondary component is usually in the range of 50 - 120  km  s@xmath0 in this observation , which is about twice as high as that suggested by @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath10 ratio between the double and single gaussian fit in figure  fig.11(d ) is also very similar to that in figure  fig.6(d ) .",
    "the ratio is usually less than 0.5 , indicating a significant improvement of the fitting by using the double gaussian fit instead of the single gaussian fit .      during the eis scan ,",
    "the aia instrument took full - disk images of the sun in several euv channels at a cadence of 12  s. we selected images in the passbands of 171 , 193 and 211 for our analysis .",
    "the dominant emission of these passbands has a temperature around 0.8 mk , 1.3 mk , and 2 mk , respectively .",
    "there were a few missing frames in each passband so that an linear interpolation was applied to the data .",
    "the pixel size is about 0.6@xmath22 .",
    "we extracted a sub - region enclosing the ar observed by eis and co - aligned different image frames .",
    "a movie of aia 193 images and the running difference images is available online ( aia193.mpeg ) .",
    "fig.12(a ) shows an image of aia 193 at 12:06 .",
    "the rectangle indicates the region scanned by eis .",
    "the cross correlation technique was used to coalign aia 193 and eis fe  274.20 .    upward propagating disturbances ( pds )",
    "are clearly present in the aia movie .",
    "these disturbances are mainly found at the two boundaries of the ar and coincide with obvious blueward asymmetries as seen from figure  fig.7(h ) , suggesting a connection of the two .",
    "the speed of these disturbances can be estimated by placing a virtual slit along the propagation direction of the disturbances and calculating the slope of a bright strip in the space - time ( s - t ) plot ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig.12](b)-(g ) show the s - t plots of the original and detrended intensities for the dotted line shown in figure  fig.12(a ) .",
    "the detrended intensities were used to better reveal the faint outflow signatures and they were obtained by first subtracting a 8-minute running average from the original intensity time series and then normalized to the running average at each location of the slit .",
    "one example of pd is indicated by the inclined dashed line .",
    "the speed of this pd , the slope of the dashed line , is estimated to be 91  km  s@xmath0 .    as the pds",
    "are usually present at different passbands of aia , in principle we should be able to compare the speed of a certain pd at different temperatures using aia data . for a certain virtual slit",
    ", we often find similar patterns of the s - t plots ( both the original and detrended intensities ) in the 193 passband and the other two passbands ( particularly the 211 passband ) . in most cases we did not find an obvious increasing trend in the speed with increasing temperature , which seems to support the interpretation of pds as multi - thermal high - speed upflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "however , a recent investigation suggests that non - dominant cool ions such as o   may contribute significantly to the total emission of the 193 and 211 passbands @xcite . but cool ions such as o v would not be expected to show obvious emission over a large height range .",
    "for example , pds are also seen off - limb in a coronal hole up to heights of 50 - 100 mm with aia @xcite , i.e. , heights where emission from cool lines does not typically occur at sufficient strength .",
    "this renders the impact of non - dominant cool ions less likely .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility of slow waves .",
    "perhaps both slow waves and upflows are existing in our observations .",
    "in fact waves can be exited by high - speed flows .",
    "but our eis result that lines with different formation temperatures basically show similar velocities seems to suggest that upflows dominate the emission .",
    "we note that for some virtual slits the s - t plots show some differences in different aia passbands , especially between the 171  passband and the other two passbands .",
    "the emission in the 171  passband is dominated by fe  171.107 @xcite , which is formed in the upper transition region and thus may have a smaller scale height compared to the hotter emission in the other two passbands . moreover , due to the different sensitivity , signal to noise ratio , and emission contrast in different passbands we may not always be able to clearly identify every outflow event in all the three passbands from the s - t plots . the 211  passband samples plasma with a temperature much closer to the formation temperature of fe  274.20",
    ". however , the 211  images have a lower signal to noise ratio and are thus noisier compared to the 193  images . since the s - t plots in the 211  passband are highly similar to those in the 193  passband , in the following we concentrate on the 193 images .",
    "we identified 39 well - isolated disturbances propagating along the fan - like structure at the left boundary of the ar and calculated their propagating speeds in the 193 passband .",
    "a speed distribution was then obtained . a comparison of this speed distribution with the distribution of the velocities derived from eis fe  202.04 line profiles ( through double gaussian fit , rb@xmath7 , and rb@xmath18 analysis ) is presented in figure  [ fig.13](a ) & ( b ) . here",
    "only line profiles with obvious blueward asymmetries in the fan - like structure at the left boundary of the ar were used . by using the potential field source surface ( pfss ) model @xcite ,",
    "the inclination angles of the magnetic field lines in the fan - like structure at the left boundary of the ar were estimated to be around 55@xmath23 with respect to the line of sight .",
    "disturbances propagating at a speed of @xmath24 along these magnetic field lines should exhibit a plane - of - sky speed of @xmath24@xmath25 and a line - of - sight speed of @xmath24@xmath26 .",
    "the ratio of the two speed components is 1.43 . since the speeds derived from s - t plots of aia images are the real speeds projected onto the plane of sky and the speeds derived from eis line profiles are the line - of - sight component of the real speeds , the ratio of the two should be around 1.43 . from figure  [ fig.13 ] we find that this is indeed the case .",
    "the speeds derived by using aia data are systematically larger than those derived by using eis data .",
    "the ratio of the two average speeds is around 135/85=1.58 , which is close to 1.43 . for comparison ,",
    "the rb@xmath7 velocity histogram is multiplied by 1.58 and overplotted as the dotted line in figure  [ fig.13](b ) . the small difference between 1.58 and 1.43",
    "could easily be caused by the fact that the pfss model is not expected to give a perfect representation of what viewing angles the real sun presents .",
    "we think that in the future 3-d reconstruction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be considered as an alternate method to help relate the velocities derived from imaging and spectroscopic observations . in figure  [ fig.13 ]",
    "we can also compare histograms of the relative intensities derived from eis fe  202.04 line profiles ( in panel ( c ) , through double gaussian fit , rb@xmath7 , and rb@xmath18 analysis ) and those derived from s - t plots ( d ) .",
    "the latter was obtained through the following process : we first smoothed the original time series with a 1-hour kernel .",
    "after that we subtracted the smoothed time series from the original one and obtained a time series of intensity change .",
    "the relative intensity was then obtained by normalising the maximum intensity change to the average intensity at each slit location . from figure  [ fig.13](d )",
    "we can see that the relative intensity is usually a few percent but can also be larger than 10% , which is consistent with magnitude of the relative intensity of the secondary component revealed by rb asymmetry analysis and double gaussian fit . for a better comparison ,",
    "the rb@xmath7 relative intensity histogram is overplotted as the dotted line in figure  [ fig.13](d ) .",
    "note that the lack of small values of the relative intensity derived from eis line profiles are due to the fact that we only selected profiles with significant blueward asymmetries .",
    "these results provide further support to the argument that the blueward asymmetries of coronal line profiles are caused by the upward propagating disturbances at ar boundaries @xcite .    as mentioned by @xcite , although there are striking similarities , it is not clear how the outflows inferred from eis line profiles and the pds seen in euv imaging observations are related .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the blue shifts ( from single gaussian fit ) of eis lines are only of the order of 20 - 50 km s@xmath0 and no periodicity has been reported .",
    "while the pds in imaging observations have a speed of @xmath1100  km  s@xmath0 and they are often quasi - periodic .",
    "now we understand that the eis line profile consists of two components and that the secondary component has a velocity of @xmath1100  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "and we have already demonstrated that the secondary component is also quasi - periodically enhanced or weakened @xcite .",
    "the consistency between properties of the pds observed by aia and those of the secondary component revealed by rb asymmetry analysis and double gaussian fit of eis line profiles suggests a close connection of the two .",
    "it is thus natural to suggest that the pds are responsible for the blueward asymmetries of line profiles .",
    "the non - thermal width of the secondary component is probably caused by both the superposition of multiple unresolved upflows and the alfvenic motions associated with the upflows @xcite .",
    "we have to mention that in figure  [ fig.13 ] we only present the results for the fan - like structure at the northeast boundary of the ar because of the simple magnetic field structure there .",
    "from the online movie ( aia193.mpeg ) we can see that outward propagating disturbances are also clearly present in the fan - like structure to the southwest of the ar .",
    "we produced several s - t plots and found generally similar s - t patterns in different passbands .",
    "however , the footpoints of these fan loops ( around x=@xmath27 , y=@xmath28 ) are mixed together and the higher parts of different loops are not well - separated , making it difficult to identify a well - isolated propagating disturbance in the s - t plots . in other parts of the ar ,",
    "magnetic field structures are either too complex or only slightly inclined with respect to the line of sight so that reliable speeds may not be obtained through s - t plots .",
    "in conclusion , the presence of asymmetric coronal line profiles in loop footpoint regions suggests that at least two emission components are present : an almost stationary primary component and a high - speed secondary component",
    ". the secondary emission component might play an important role in supplying the corona with hot plasma .",
    "we have generated artificial spectra composed of two gaussian components to test the ability of extracting the gaussian parameters ( intensity , velocity , and width ) of the secondary component through the originally defined ( use the single gaussian fit to determine the line centroid ) and a slightly modified ( use the spectral position corresponding to the peak intensity as the line centroid ) technique of the rb asymmetry analysis , and find that this technique , especially the modified one , can provide a relatively accurate estimate of the parameters of the secondary component if the velocity is larger and the width is not considerably larger than the primary component width .",
    "we have applied the modified technique to the spectra obtained by the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ) onboard hinode in two active regions and found that the distributions of the velocity / width determined from the rb asymmetry analysis peak around 80 km s@xmath0/60 km s@xmath0 .",
    "a comparison of such distributions with the values of velocity / width calculated from the artificial spectra suggests that the secondary component can not be very broad or narrow and that the widths of the two components are comparable .",
    "the velocity of the secondary component is usually within the range of 50 - 150  km  s@xmath0 and seldom reaches as high as 200  km  s@xmath0 or as low as 40  km  s@xmath0 in our eis observations .",
    "the relative intensity of the secondary component with respect to the primary one is often a few percent but can sometimes reach 30% .",
    "our conclusions are very different from those of @xcite , who claimed that the secondary component contributes some 10% to 20% to the total emission , is about twice as broad as the primary component and blueshifted by up to 50  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the velocity range of the secondary component we derived here is roughly consistent with , yet slightly smaller than that derived by @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the very high speed of 200  km  s@xmath0 mentioned by @xcite seems to be not very likely .    using the parameters determined from the rb asymmetry analysis and single gaussian fit as initial values for several free parameters , we have performed a double gaussian fit to the spectra that were observed to have obvious blueward asymmetries .",
    "the rb asymmetry analysis has been performed for the third time , but then using the centroid of the secondary component determined from the double gaussian fit as the line centroid .",
    "the double gaussian fit and the rb asymmetry analyses have given basically consistent results .",
    "the properties of the secondary component stay relatively stable across the temperature range of log(_t_/k)=5.8 - 6.3 .",
    "the double gaussian fit also shows that the velocity of the primary component is often blue shifted by @xmath110  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we have also used imaging observation simultaneously performed by the aia instrument onboard _",
    "sdo _ and demonstrated that the propagating disturbances coincide with obvious blueward asymmetries of line profiles , show an intensity change similar to the relative intensity of the secondary component of line profiles and an average velocity consistent with that derived from emission line profiles .",

    "as we mentioned in section 2 , both the rb@xmath7 and rb@xmath6 techniques can provide a relatively accurate estimate of the gaussian parameters of the secondary component when the offset velocity is larger than the gaussian width of the primary component .",

    "the most prominent difference is the smaller values of relative intensity and width , and larger upflow velocity for rb@xmath6 .",

    "thus the line moments and profile asymmetries are noisy there .",
    "the very similar behavior of line moments and profile asymmetries between fe  274.20 and the weaker but clean fe  264.78 line provides further confidence that the blend of si  274.18 line can be safely ignored in our analysis .",
    "we also applied the techniques of rb asymmetry analysis and double gaussian fit to an eis observation of ar noaa 10978 from 11:43 to 17:03 on 2007 december 12 .",
    "@xcite found that the secondary emission component in this ar has velocities around 110  km  s@xmath0 and , as they stated in their paper , often as high as 200  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite used the fe  195.12 line and they mentioned that the blend of this line , fe  195.18 , should not significantly affect the fe  195.12 line in the low - density @xcite outflow region ( ar edges ) . however , to avoid the complexity introduced by this blend we decided to turn to other clean and strong fe   lines .",
    "we found that in the ar edges some other lines at the far blue wing of the fe   192.39 line can be relatively strong and thus affect the results of rb asymmetry analysis and double gaussian fit .",
    "so here we mainly present the results of the fe   193.51 line , which is clean and about 2/3 as strong as fe  195.12 .",
    "since the line is very strong , there is no need to perform a spatial average of the line profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig.s3 ] shows the spatial distributions of the single gaussian parameters and profile asymmetry .",
    "similar to ar 10938 and ar 11106 , the two loop footpoint regions are characterized by an enhancement in the blue shift , line width , and blueward profile asymmetry , and there is an obvious correlation between the doppler shift / gaussian width and profile asymmetry .",
    "note that the white strip in each panel mark locations where the observed data is lost .",
    "two examples of line profiles and the corresponding rb asymmetry profiles of the fe  193.51 and si  275.35 lines are shown in figure  fig.s4 .",
    "the profiles were averaged over 3 pixels centered at the locations marked in figure  fig.s3(a ) in both spatial dimensions . @xcite mentioned that cool lines like si  275.35 do not have any significant asymmetries and that their profiles can be accurately represented by a single gaussian .",
    "we found that this is not always the case .",
    "similar to what we found in ar 11106 , at some locations the si  275.35 line profiles clearly exhibit obvious asymmetries .",
    "as shown in figure  fig.s4 , usually the primary component is redshifted by @xmath115  km  s@xmath0 and the velocity difference between the two components is smaller than that of fe  193.51 , which might be due to the complexity introduced by cooling downflows .",
    "similar to what we did for ar 10938 and ar 11106 , the techniques of rb asymmetry analysis and rb@xmath7 guided double gaussian fit were applied to each spectral profile with an obvious blueward asymmetry ( the average rb asymmetry in 60 - 110  km  s@xmath0 smaller than -0.05 ) .",
    "spatial distributions of the double gaussian parameters are presented in figure  fig.s5 .",
    "spatial distributions of the gaussian parameters derived from the rb@xmath7 and rb@xmath18 analyses are similar to those of the secondary component shown in figure  fig.s5 , and thus are not shown here .",
    "the distributions of the intensity ratio ( relative intensity ) , velocity difference ( velocity ) , and gaussian width of the secondary component as derived from double gaussian fit and rb asymmetry analysis ( rb@xmath7,rb@xmath18 ) , as shown in figure  fig.s6(a)-(c ) , reveal no big difference from those in figure  fig.11 . however , the velocity distributions seem to peak at @xmath195  km  s@xmath0 , a value larger than those in ar 10938 ( @xmath175  km  s@xmath0 ) and ar 11106 ( @xmath185  km  s@xmath0 ) and close to that derived by @xcite ( @xmath1110  km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "the velocity seldom reaches as high as 200  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "in fact from figure 7 of @xcite one can conclude that the velocity of the secondary component is usually in the range of 60 - 170  km  s@xmath0 and that only a very minor portion of the velocities exceeds 200  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "as seen from figure  fig.s6(d ) , the @xmath10 ratio between the double and single gaussian fit is generally smaller than 1 , indicating an improvement of the fitting by using the double gaussian fit instead of the single gaussian fit",

    "<S> recent spectroscopic observations have revealed the ubiquitous presence of blueward asymmetries of emission lines formed in the solar corona and transition region . </S>",

    "<S> such asymmetries suggest at least two emission components : a primary component accounting for the background emission and a secondary component associated with high - speed upflows . the latter has been proposed to play a vital role in the coronal heating process and </S>",
    "<S> there is no agreement on its properties . here </S>",
    "<S> we slightly modify the initially developed technique of red - blue ( rb ) asymmetry analysis and apply it to both artificial spectra and spectra observed by the euv imaging spectrometer onboard hinode , and demonstrate that the secondary component usually contributes a few percent of the total emission , has a velocity ranging from 50 to 150  km  s@xmath0 and a gaussian width comparable to that of the primary one in loop footpoint regions . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the rb asymmetry analysis are then used to guide a double gaussian fit and we find that the obtained properties of the secondary component are generally consistent with those obtained from the rb asymmetry analysis . through a comparison of the location , relative intensity , and velocity distribution of the blueward secondary component with the properties of the upward propagating disturbances revealed in simultaneous images from the atmospheric imaging assembly onboard the solar dynamics observatory , we find a clear association of the secondary component with the propagating disturbances . </S>"
