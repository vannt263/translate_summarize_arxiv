    "the correspondence between the sc theory and simulations is better for @xmath241 than for @xmath238 , which can be again traced back to the fact that the strong and the weak coupling results are very close to one another for charged surfaces of opposite sign in the whole range of rescaled separations , whereas they differ significantly in the case of surfaces of equal sign . for intermediate and large couplings ,",
    "we have not attempted to compare our data with the second - order wc approximation as this approximation breaks down at the range of distances shown in the figures ( section [ sec : wc_crit ] ) .",

    "we now consider the simulated bound - state separation , @xmath101 , as a function of the coupling parameter in fig .",
    "[ fig : bound_xi ] ( symbols ) . for @xmath234 , the pb theory ( @xmath14 ) gives only repulsion and predicts no bound state . while the sc theory predicts a closely packed bound state with @xmath243 given by eq .",

    "as seen , by increasing the coupling parameter the simulation data for @xmath101 ( filled squares ) decrease monotonically and rather slowly converge to the sc prediction ( dotted line ) .",

( [ eq : pb_a * ] ) , solid line ) , that later follows the pb plus second - order corrections line ( dot - dashed line ) and then rapidly approaches the strong - coupling result @xmath249 ( dashed line ) .",
    "as already noted the differences between strong and weak coupling in this case are marginal in the rescaled representation .    the dependence of @xmath105 on @xmath25 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bound_zeta ] complements the above observations .",
    "the bound - state separation diverges for @xmath250 both in simulations as well as in the analytical limits . here",
    "we reproduce the simulation results at @xmath234 and @xmath251 , which again clearly show the convergence to the sc result for @xmath234 and the crossover from the pb result ( solid line ) to the sc result ( dashed line ) for @xmath235 upon increasing the coupling parameter .",
    "the quantitative agreement between the simulations and the analytical results in the two limiting cases of pb and sc is excellent .",
    "note here again that the second - order wc expansion ( dotted line in the inset ) begins to fail at small separations as it deviates from the limiting pb results as well as from the simulation data .",
    "since the pb pressure is zero on the pb phase boundary line , the validity of the second order wc correction can be assessed analytically only by performing a two - loop calculation which goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "to summarize , we have derived theoretical forms for the interaction pressure as well as the counterionic density profiles of asymmetrically charged planar surfaces with neutralizing counterions in between . based on the field - theoretical methods we analyzed two different regimes of weak and strong coupling as defined by the electrostatic coupling parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the crossover between these two regimes is studied _ via _ monte - carlo simulations .    for small values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the system is described very well by the _ weak coupling _ ( wc ) theory , that in the lowest ( zeroth ) order coincides with the mean - field poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) result .",
    "the second order of wc corresponds to a first - order loop expansion and represents the contribution from correlated quadratic fluctuations around the mean - field or saddle - point solution .",
    "this second - order correction , which is proportional to @xmath0 , always lowers the interaction pressure between the surfaces and thus leads to an attractive contribution to the total interaction pressure . since it corresponds to an expansion of the partition function around the mean - field saddle point it has to be smaller , in absolute terms , than the mean - field result .",
    "net attraction given by second - order fluctuations term ( for interacting surfaces of equal sign ) is therefore inconsistent with the nature of the wc approximation .    for large values of the coupling parameter @xmath0 ,",
    "the weak coupling approach breaks down and the virial expansion amounting to the _ strong coupling _ ( sc ) approximation must be used .",
    "the sc approach is effectively a one - particle theory and takes properly into account the strong correlation and interaction of the counterions with external surface fields on the leading order @xcite .",
    "following standard procedures , we derived an analytical expression for interaction pressure in the sc limit .",
    "the interaction pressure in this case is always lower than the pb result and can be negative ( corresponding to a net attractive force ) even for charged surfaces of equal sign .",
    "we compared both our theories , _",
    "i.e. _ wc with second - order corrections and sc , with monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we found very good agreement for both theories in their expected regime of validity . as expected , the wc approach is valid for separations @xmath252 .",
    "the second - order correction improves the small discrepancies between pb and mc results at large separations but it tends to fail for smaller distances when discrepancies get more pronounced . on the other hand , the sc theory describes the behavior perfectly at small separations @xmath253 . for small enough coupling parameter @xmath0 ,",
    "the validity of the pb approximation spreads to smaller separations , @xmath68 , where pb and sc results nearly coincide ( in the rescaled representation ) .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that for sufficiently small @xmath0 , the pb result is valid on the whole interval @xmath68 .",
    "note that the second - order wc correction term consistently diverges ( toward large negative values ) for small inter - surface separations , @xmath254 , irrespective of @xmath25 , which makes it in general inapplicable in this limit .",
    "the reason for this is simple . for small inter - surface separations",
    "the mean - field solution becomes more and more homogeneous , almost a constant , and the interaction free energy approaches its standard zero - frequency van der waals form that diverges for small separations .",
    "in the case of surface charges with equal sign , @xmath67 , the wc theory predicts no attraction and hence no bound state .",
    "the attraction and the corresponding bound state appear only for coupling parameters @xmath0 that are large enough , as predicted by the sc theory . in the case of charged surfaces of opposite sign , @xmath161 , the attraction appears also in wc limit above a threshold value @xmath255 that represents the equilibrium surface - surface separation .",
    "it is notable that for charged surfaces of opposite sign , the wc analysis in general performs much better than for the surfaces of equal sign and that the sc and the wc results are very close to one another for charged surfaces of opposite sign in the whole range of rescaled separations , whereas they differ significantly in the case of surfaces of equal sign .",
    "there is also only a marginal difference between the pb and sc counterion density profiles in the rescaled representation for surfaces of opposite sign . a reasonable explanation for this would be in our opinion that for oppositely charged surfaces the counterions mostly feel the effect of the strong uniform external field provided by the surface charges , which acts similarly in the strong as well as the weak coupling limit .",
    "thus the mean - field and the strong - coupling approaches should converge . in the case of similarly charged surfaces",
    ", the mean - field theory depends more on the local counterion density whereas the strongly coupled counterions still feel mostly the external field .",
    "thus the difference between the wc and the sc frameworks in the @xmath161 and @xmath67 cases .",
    "our results support an emerging new paradigm , according to which the wc and the sc limit bracket the exact results for the interaction pressure between charged surfaces neutralized by mobile counterions .",
    "they indeed provide quantitatively correct results for the interaction pressure in the limit of small and large inter - surface separations , while at intermeditae separations the exact results are always located between the two limits .",
    "it thus seems advisable that in analyzing the electrostatic interactions in colloidal systems one always calculates both analytic limits , the wc as well as the sc , in order to get a good handle on the range of values that the interaction can assume for any value of the electrostatic coupling parameter . in future",
