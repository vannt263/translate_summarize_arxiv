    "the calculation of qcd thermodynamics from first principle is important for various research areas such as heavy ion phenomenology , cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "lattice qcd enables us to carry out such calculations . especially for hic phenomenology",
    "it is mandatory to improve estimates on some basic thermodynamic quantities which have been obtained in previous lattice calculations .",
    "since thermodynamics of lattice qcd requires huge computational resources , it is difficult to perform an ideal simulation .",
    "recent studies tell us that quark masses and the number of flavors strongly affect thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "reliable continuum extrapolations are of tremendous importance as well @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is our goal to study qcd thermodynamics with almost realistic quark masses on the qcdoc machine at brookhaven national laboratory and the apenext machine at bielefeld university . the calculation is performed with @xmath0 , which means 2 degenerate light quarks and one heavier quark on lattices with @xmath1 and 6 .",
    "the lightest quark masses of our simulation yields a pion mass of about 150 mev and kaon mass of about 500 mev .    for such calculations we adopt the p4fat3 quark action , which is an improved staggered quark action @xcite , with a tree - level improved symanzik gauge action . by using the p4fat3 action , the free quark dispersion relation has the continuum form up to @xmath2 , and taste symmetry breaking is suppressed by a 3-link fattening term .",
    "the action also improves bulk thermodynamical quantities in the high temperature limit @xcite .",
    "the improvements are essential to control the continuum extrapolation on rather coarse lattices , i.e. @xmath1 and 6 .",
    "the gauge ensembles are generated by an exact rhmc algorithm @xcite .    as a status report of the project , in this proceeding , we present several thermodynamics quantities , which are susceptibilities of the light and strange quark chiral condensate , the polyakov loop susceptibility , the static quark potential , and the spatial string tension .",
    "the details of the critical temperature calculation are given in our recent paper @xcite .",
    "to investigate the qcd critical temperature and phase diagram , order parameter of the qcd transition are indispensable . in the chiral limit",
    "the chiral condensate @xmath3 is the order parameter for the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of qcd . on the other hand in the heavy quark limit the polyakov loop",
    "@xmath4 is the order parameter of the deconfinement phase transition . for finite quark masses ,",
    "these observables remain good indicators for the ( pseudo ) critical point . especially their susceptibilities are useful to determine the critical coupling @xmath5 in numerical simulations .",
    "figure  1 shows the susceptibilities of the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop .",
    "their peak positions define the point of most drastic change of each order parameters , i.e. the ( pseudo ) critical point of the qcd transition .",
    "the results are interpolated in the coupling @xmath6 by using the multi - histogram re - weighting technique @xcite .",
    "the strength of the transition decreases with increasing quark masses , this is reflected in the decreasing peak height of the chiral susceptibilities .",
    "we calculate these susceptibilities on lattices with aspect ratios of @xmath7 and 4 .",
    "since we see a rather small volume dependence the results suggest that the transition is in fact not a true phase transition in the thermodynamic sense but a rapid crossover .",
    "the peak position of the chiral and polyakov loop susceptibilities are almost identical , i.e. the chiral and deconfinement transition occur at almost the same temperature .",
    "the discrepancy between the peak positions shrinks with increasing volume .",
    "the lattice scale is determined from the heavy quark potential @xmath8 which is extracted from wilson loops .",
    "the wilson loop expectation values are calculated on @xmath9 lattices with ape smearing in spatial direction .",
    "the spatial path in a loop is determined by the bresenham algorithm @xcite .",
    "we calculate the string tension , @xmath10 and sommer scale @xmath11 , which is defined @xcite as the distance where the corresponding force of the static quark potential matches a certain value suggested by phenomenology : @xmath12 . to remove short range lattice artifacts we use the improved distance , @xmath13 , which is defined as @xmath14    in our lattice setup , we find almost no mass and cutoff dependence in the potential scaled by @xmath11 at @xmath15 and 6 ( fig.2(left ) ) .",
    "as discussed in previous studies @xcite , we also find no string breaking effects even at large @xmath16 .",
    "to estimate systematic uncertainties of the potential fit , we performed several types of fits , e.g. different fit - ranges in @xmath16 ( see fig.2(right ) ) and fit - forms ( 3 & 4 params .",
    "fits ) , @xmath17 the differences in the mean values of the fits are evaluated as a systematic uncertainty of the scale setting . from a combined quark mass and",
    "cut off extrapolation of @xmath18 we finally obtain a critical temperature of @xmath19  mev at the physical point @xcite . here",
    "we used @xmath20  fm to set the scale .",
    "the first error summarizes all statistical and systematic errors on @xmath11 and the critical couplings @xmath5 and the second error reflects the remaining uncertainties in the extrapolation .",
    "let us now discuss the calculation of the spatial string tension which is important to verify the theoretical concept of dimensional reduction at high temperatures .",
    "the spatial string tension is extracted from the spatial static quark `` potential '' ( from spatial wilson loops ) .",
    "we use the same analysis technique as for the usual ( temporal ) static quark potential .    at high temperature",
    ", the spatial string tension @xmath21 is expected to behave like @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the temperature dependent coupling constant from the 2-loop rg equation , @xmath24 if dimensional reduction works , the parameter``@xmath25 '' should be equal to the 3-dimensional string tension and should be flavor independent .    our 2 + 1 flavor result yields @xmath26 and @xmath27 , obtained by a fit with eq .",
    "[ 2loop ] . on the other hand ,",
    "we plot in fig.[sigma_s ] also the quenched result @xcite which gives @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we thus find that the parameter `` c '' is  within statistical errors  independent on the number of dynamical flavors and that dimensional reduction works well even for @xmath30 .",
    "this analysis can and will be refined in the future by taking into account higher order corrections to eq .",
