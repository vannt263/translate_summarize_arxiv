    "the problem of interacting cooper pairs and/or bosons , together with the possibility of a quantum control of long range phase coherence in low dimensional systems has received considerable interest since the experiments@xcite on homogeneous lead and bismuth films , which exhibit a transition from a superconducting to an insulating phase as a function of thickness .",
    "it is known , since the work of abrahams et al .",
    "@xcite , that no true metallic behavior can be expected to be observed for 2d non - interacting electrons at t=0 , because all the states will be localized by an arbitrarily small amount of disorder .",
    "when one includes coulomb interaction , the situation is less clear , but the common belief is that a metallic phase should still not appear at t=0 in the presence of disorder - though no rigorous proof is available@xcite . yet , in the presence of attractive interactions , one expects a superconducting state both at t=0 and finite temperature , even in presence of a finite amount of disorder , due to its relative ineffectiveness for a transition of kosterlitz - thouless type ( the degree of relevance being given by the harris criterion@xcite ) .    the existence of a superconducting state at t=0 in 2d systems is then considered to be directly linked to that of an insulating state , with no intermediate metallic phase present .",
    "one hence should be able to observe a direct superconductor - insulator transition ( sit ) at zero temperature in 2d as a function of disorder , interaction strength , magnetic field or any other external parameter which can drive the system away from the superconducting phase .",
    "there are different theoretical scenarios which are commonly discussed in connection with the salient features of such quantum phase transitions : i ) dissipative models , considering a network of josephson coupled superconducting grains shunted by resistors@xcite , where the competition between the josephson intergrain coupling and the charging energy yields an increase of the phase fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter and hence leads to a phase disordered state .",
    "dissipation thereby plays the role of suppressing quantum phase fluctuations and thus competes with the charging mechanism .",
    "ii ) bose - hubbard models , where the superconducting phase is due to the bose - einstein condensation of charge-2e bosons and the insulating phase due to a proliferation of vortices and localization of pairs@xcite .",
    "while the sit was long thought to be a paradigm of the above theories , recent experiments have thrown some doubt about that .",
    "they revealed , what seems to be a low - temperature metallic state which is intertwined in such a sit and thus requires a more appropriate theoretical description . in magnetic field tuned experiments on mo - ge samples@xcite , in granular superconductors ( ga films@xcite and pb films@xcite ) , and in josephson junction arrays@xcite a metallic phase has been observed .",
    "moreover , the recent experiments of kapitulnik et al.@xcite , in which a metallic phase has been observed sandwiched between the superconductor and the insulating phase , suggest that perhaps two phase transitions accompany the loss of phase coherence in 2d superconductors : ( i ) a superconductor to a `` bose metal '' and ( ii ) a `` bose metal '' to an insulator . a `` bose metal '' in this context ,",
    "is thought of just a gapless non - superfluid liquid with metallic like transport@xcite .",
    "these experimental results have led to reconsider the whole issue of the sit .",
    "one recent proposal to handle such a new viewpoint of the sit has been to reexamine the standard on - site charging model . by including nearest neighbor charging terms it was shown that the resulting uniform bose metal state lacks any trace of either phase or charge order@xcite , due to a competition between the order parameters which describe the onset of charge order and that of phase coherence .",
    "a different point of view@xcite is , that in the quantum disordered regime a cancellation happens between the exponentially long quasi - particle scattering time and the exponentially small quasi - particle population , which ultimately leads to a finite dc conductivity .",
    "finally , intrinsic as well as extrinsic sources of dissipation have been suggested as potentially relevant for the occurrence of a non - superfluid metallic phase in proximity to the superconducting phase@xcite . in this context",
    ", the dissipation is a relevant perturbation@xcite , which , depending on the strength of the coupling to the dissipative source , can drive the system from a _ superconductor - to - insulator transition _ to a _ superconductor - to - metal transition_@xcite .",
    "several other ideas supported a scenario where the system could break into superconducting and insulating `` islands '' weakly linked via percolating paths before going into a metallic phase , dominated by vortex dissipation@xcite .",
    "this `` puddle '' scenario matches with the view to describe the 2d superconductor - metal transition via superconducting islands embedded in thin metal films@xcite .",
    "detailed analysis of the puddle - like model considered strongly fluctuating superconducting grains embedded in a metallic matrix@xcite , predicting a _ metal - to - superconductor transition _ with a metallic phase just above the transition dominated by andreev reflections between the superconducting grains . finally , recent investigations directed the attention to new phases with bose metallic features , where the dissipation is dynamically self - generated , as in the quantum phase glass model , where disorder in the distribution of the tunnelling amplitudes and quantum fluctuations destroy phase coherence@xcite .    on similar lines as those dealt with in a great variety of such different approaches discussed in the literature ,",
    "our aim here is to investigate a system where the breakdown of superconductivity situates itself in between the case of a `` bosonic '' and a `` fermionic '' mechanism for superconductivity suppression .",
    "we focus on determining the possible ground states for interacting cooper pairs , in close relation to the classical notions of superfluidity and localization of bosons and , on a more general basis , how the phase coherence can be tuned to a phase disordered state whose transport properties may be unconventional . in particular , we consider within the framework of a boson - fermion model ( bfm ) , a system where localized bound electron pairs ( hard - core bosons ) form an array of `` andreev''-like scattering centers coupled to a fermionic subsystem of itinerant uncorrelated electrons ( quantum pair - exchange ) .",
    "this scenario goes beyond that of pure phase models widely discussed in the literature , since here one is dealing with bosonic degrees of freedom ( localized bound pairs ) as well as fermionic ones ( itinerant electrons ) for which , due to the emergence of pair correlations , one is dealing with both amplitude as well as phase modes . the possibility to tune from short to long - range phase coherence arises from the following competing effects :    \\(i ) on the one hand",
    ", the short range interaction between bosons and fermion pairs ( holes ) induces a local phase locking in a configuration with a quantum superposition between bosons and electron pairs , leaving the common phase undetermined .",
    "\\(ii ) on the other hand , the itinerancy of the electrons tends to lock and rigidly extend these initially arbitrary local phases . as a result",
    ", phase coherence develops over longer distances by suppressing the quantum fluctuations of the local phase , which will involve the dynamics of amplitude fluctuations .    out of this competition",
    "one can recover either a superfluid state in the regime of a small scattering rate or a phase disordered state in the limit where the pair exchange dominates and the local quantum phase fluctuations do not allow for long - range phase coherence . as we shall show , the physics described by this scenario strongly depends on the concentration of fermions and bosons , on the coupling strength , as well as on temperature and magnetic fields .",
    "the purpose of this study is to analyze how a transition from a superconductor to an insulator may occur and discuss the features which can give rise to unconventional dynamics and , eventually , unconventional transport properties in the proximity of such a transition .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we will introduce the bfm and describe its main qualitative features and the phenomena which can be described by it . in sect .",
    "iii , we shall develop a path integral representation of this model and derive an effective coarse grained action , which , after integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom , is able to describe the low energy dynamics of the phase and amplitude modes . in sect .",
    "iv we will discuss the phase diagram based on the simplest approximation of such a coarse grained effective action in terms of a phase - only action and explore the transition from a superconductor to a phase disordered state as a function of the coupling and the density of bosons . in sect .",
    "v , we will study the physical features which arise from the intrinsic berry phase term present in our effective action and which arises from the hard core nature of the bosons , represented by quantum pseudo spin-@xmath0 variables .",
    "in section vi we compare the salient features of this bfm scenario with similar scenarios , such as the negative - u hubbard model , the bose - hubbard model and josephson junction arrays . in the discussion , section vii , we review the main results obtained in this paper and indicate further developments planed for the near future .",
    "the boson - fermion model ( bfm ) in recent years has attracted considerable attention as a model capable of capturing basic physical properties in many body systems with strong interaction , giving rise to the formation of resonant pair states of bosonic nature inside a reservoir of fermions .",
    "such a scenario was initially proposed by one of us ( jr ) as an alternative to the scenario of the hypothetical and yet to be experimentally verified _",
    "bipolaronic superconductivity_. it was meant to describe the intermediary coupling regime between the adiabatic and anti - adiabatic limits in polaronic systems , where an exchange between localized bipolarons and pairs of uncorrelated electrons can be assumed to take place ( for a recent intuitive justification of such a scenario see for instance ref.@xcite ) .    as it has turned out , this boson - fermion scenario has a much wider range of applicability than that for which it was initially proposed and seems to apply to very different physical situation such as : hole pairing in semiconductors@xcite , isospin singlet pairing in nuclear matter@xcite , d - wave hole and antiferromagnetic triplet pairing in the positive - u hubbard model@xcite ( and possibly also in the t - j model ) , entangled atoms in squeezed states in molecular bose einstein condensation in traps@xcite and superfluidity in ultracold fermi gases induced by a feshbach resonance@xcite .",
    "the bfm is reminiscent of an anisotropic kondo lattice model in terms of a pseudospin-@xmath0 , but characterizing localized electron pairs instead of localized impurity spins as in the kondo analogue .",
    "its hamiltonian is given by    @xmath1    the pseudo - spin operators @xmath2 $ ] denote the local bound electron pairs ( bosons ) and @xmath3 $ ] the itinerant pairs of uncorrelated electrons .",
    "@xmath4 $ ] stand for the creation and annihilation operators of the itinerant electrons ( fermions ) and @xmath5 is the strength of the @xmath6 exchange interaction .",
    "the hopping integral for the itinerant electrons , which is assumed to be different from zero only for nearest neighbor sites , is given by @xmath7 with a band half width equal to @xmath8 , @xmath9 denoting the coordination number of the underlying lattice .",
    "the energy level of the bound electron pairs is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the number of the ensemble of bosons and fermions being conserved , @xmath11 , implies a common chemical potential @xmath12 for both subsystems .",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 indicate the occupation number per site of the hard core - bosons and of the electrons with up and down spin states .",
    "the exchange coupling between the bosons and the fermion pairs can be considered as an effective andreev - like scattering leading to local states which are quantum superpositions of the form @xmath15\\times \\nonumber \\\\ & & [ \\cos(\\phi_i ) + \\tau_{i}^{+}\\sin(\\theta_i/2)\\sin(\\phi_i ) ] |0\\rangle .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such states evolve gradually out of the system of localized dephased bosons and essentially uncorrelated free fermions , which characterize the high temperature phase of this model , when the temperature is decreased below a certain @xmath16 where resonant pairing ( not bound pairs ! ) starts to be induced in the fermionic subsystem .",
    "these pair states have already features built in which are reminiscent of those which characterize cooper pairing of fermions as well as superfluidity of bosons .",
    "the phases of the two coherent states , corresponding to the two subsystems , are the same and hence locked together , but are averaged over all angles as a consequence of the conserved particle number on any given site , @xmath17 .",
    "roughly speaking , the ground state of the system is then given by a product state @xmath18 over a finite length and time scale . in this way",
    "the localized bosons and fermion pairs acquire itinerancy@xcite which eventually leads to a superfluid state in both subsystems@xcite , provided that the effect of the local correlations between the bosons and the fermion pairs can be sufficiently diminished , but remaining still sufficiently strong to guarantee the formation of pairing in the fermionic subsystem . achieving or not this situation will depend on the relative importance of the local exchange coupling versus the fermion hopping rate ( given by the ratio @xmath19 ) and as well as on the concentration of the bosons , as shown by exact diagonalization study@xcite on finite clusters of this bfm .    what we shall attempt in the present study is to describe this physics in terms of an effective action for the phase and amplitude fields of the bosonic fields . in order to achieve this",
    "we shall put the discussion on a level which is more familiar , namely that one of josephson junction arrays and bose - hubbard models .",
    "for that purpose let us briefly sketch the analogy which exists ( up to a certain point ) between the bfm and those systems which have been widely discussed in the literature .",
    "a physically possible realization of this bfm scenario can be imagined in form of a network of superconducting grains embedded in a metallic environment and where the only mechanism of interaction between the grains and the fermionic background is that of andreev reflections .",
    "via such a mechanism an electron ( hole ) is reflected on the grain as a hole ( electron ) leaving behind a surplus of two holes ( electrons ) in the fermionic subsystem and of two electrons ( holes ) in the grain . if the grains are such that they have a large charging energy , the fluctuations of the number of pairs on them are energetically unfavorable and hence are largely suppressed .",
    "we then have a situation where the state of the grains switches essentially between zero to double occupancy with respect to the average occupation , any time an electron ( hole ) is reflected at the interface of the grain .",
    "thus , the quantum dynamics of the single grain can be directly represented by a pseudospin@xmath0 , in order to account for the doublets which represent the two possible states of the grains .",
    "for such a possible experimental setup , the effective sites in the bfm have to be considered as defining a regular array of grains and having the same periodicity as the underlying lattice on which the fermions move with a hopping amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "moreover the size of the grains has to be such that it is much smaller than the distance between them .",
    "a pictorial view of such an experimental set up in given in fig .",
    "[ fig2-clustconf ] .",
    "the analogy between the bfm and the array of superconducting grains which scatter pairs of fermions in a metallic matrix via andreev like reflections , may ultimately serve as an experimental device on which to test and analyze the theoretical issues which will be discussed in this paper .",
    "let us now construct an effective action which describes the bfm , with the aim to extract the dynamical properties of the low energy degrees of freedom of the phase and amplitude modes for the bosons and fermion - pairs .",
    "we start by expressing the partition function in terms of a coherent - state path integral representation@xcite , where the fermionic part is formulated by means of the usual grassmann variables and the bosonic part is described by a pseudospin - coherent state representation@xcite : @xmath20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21=\\int d\\tau \\sum_i [ i s ( 1-\\cos\\theta_i)~\\partial_{\\tau } \\phi_i + \\nonumber\\\\ ( \\delta_b -2 \\mu ) \\cos\\theta_i]+ \\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle } \\bar{\\psi}_j(\\tau ) g_{ij}^{-1 } { \\psi}_i(\\tau).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath22 denotes the imaginary matsubara time variable and a nambu spinor representation for the grassmann variables , related to that of the original fermionic operators by @xmath23 the pseudospin is described by a bosonic field which in spherical coordinates is given by @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1-sphere ] ) .",
    "@xmath25 describes the polar angle of the vector @xmath26 with respect to the north pole of the @xmath9 axis , while @xmath27 is the azimuthal angle which defines the angular position of the basal plane projection of this vector .",
    "the first term of the action @xmath28 is the wess - zumino term@xcite , ensuring the correct quantization of the quantum pseudospin variable . for any path , parameterized by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the contribution of this term is equal to @xmath31 times the surface area of the sphere between this path and the north pole . for closed paths",
    "this has exactly the form of the berry phase @xcite .",
    "the second term is linked to the density of the bosons @xmath32 through the @xmath33 dependence of the pseudospin .",
    "finally , the last contribution of the action contains the coupling between the fermionic and bosonic subsystem through the green s function @xmath34 , determined by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 and @xmath39 being the conjugate field of @xmath40 . integrating out the fermionic part ,",
    "one obtains the action in terms of exclusively the bosonic fields : @xmath41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the trace has to be carried out over all internal as well as space - time indices .    up to this point",
    "no approximation has been made in the derivation of the action which describes the coupling between the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "it is important to notice that the variation of the bosonic variable @xmath30 describes both , the density fluctuations of the bosonic subsystem ( via the projection of the pseudospin vector on the @xmath9 axis , i.e. @xmath42 , being the longitudinal component ) and the amplitude fluctuations of the fermionic pair field ( via the transverse part as projection of the pseudospin vector onto the basal plane , i.e. @xmath43 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1-sphere ] ) ) .",
    "the variable @xmath29 determines the rotational degrees of freedom of the pseudospin vector , expressing its phase dynamics .    for extracting the relevant terms which control the low energy dynamics of the coupled phase and amplitude modes and performing an expansion , which is meaningful in terms of the phase variable , it is judicious to make the following steps : i ) gauge away the phase dependence from the term @xmath40 which permits to separate the trace into a part which does not depend on the phase of the bosonic field and another part that contains only spatial and time variations of @xmath44@xcite , ii ) rewrite the term @xmath40 after the gauge transformation , as a sum of two pieces , one not dependent on time ( which is linked to the average density of bosons ) and another term containing the fluctuations with respect to its mean value .",
    "the first operation is performed by applying to the operators under the trace the rotation @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denote the pauli matrices .",
    "hence , @xmath47 where @xmath48 \\sigma_3+g~\\sin\\theta_i(\\tau ) ~\\sigma_1\\right]\\delta_{ij } + \\\\ & & t_{ij } e^{i\\,[\\phi_i(\\tau)-\\phi_j(\\tau ) ] \\sigma_3/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the bosonic density is fixed in average , we now separate the part which depends on the polar angle in a time independent contribution and its time dependent correction . that is , the term @xmath49 is decomposed into its average value @xmath50 ( which is determined by fixing the density of bosons due to the spherical constraint ) plus a time dependent contribution @xmath51 $ ] which contains the fluctuation around its average value ( fig . [ fig2-sphere ] )",
    ". thus this local field , due to the constraint , will describe both : the time dependent variation of the density as well as of the pairing amplitude .",
    "next , let us write the green s function in the usual form as @xmath52 with @xmath53\\delta_{ij}$ ] and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 \\sigma_1\\\\ t_{ij}&=&t_{ij } e^ { -i ( \\phi_i(\\tau)-\\phi_j(\\tau ) ) \\frac{\\sigma_3}{2}}\\\\ \\tilde{g}&=&g \\langle\\sin[\\theta]\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from this point onward we shall assume the average density of bosons to be homogeneously distributed and thus given by @xmath56 .",
    "this implies that the bare coupling @xmath5 is renormalized to @xmath57 as a consequence of the spherical constraint of the pseudospin variable .",
    "moreover , since @xmath58 and the density of bosons is fixed in average via a suitable choice of the chemical potential and of the on - site bosonic energy , one can treat the exchange coupling as an external boson - density tunable parameter .",
    "the variation in the @xmath59 variable is then simply related to the variation of the bosonic density such that if @xmath59 varies in the range @xmath60 $ ] then @xmath13 varies in the interval @xmath61 $ ] .    before expanding the trace ,",
    "let us write down explicitly the expression of the zero order green s function , as it will be frequently used in the following steps : @xmath62\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath63 and where we introduced @xmath64 .",
    "we now evaluate the contribution of the self energy @xmath65 to the effective action .",
    "this is done in the usual way by making a loop expansion in the trace@xcite .",
    "we shall construct that expansion up to second order in the time and space derivatives of the phase variable and in the terms which contain both , the fluctuations of the density and the amplitude .",
    "for that purpose we use the standard identity : @xmath66\\\\ & = & tr \\ln { g_0}^{-1}+tr \\ln \\left [ 1 + { g_0 } \\sigma\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and then expand the second term of this expression up to second order in @xmath67 , such as to keep all the contributions up to quadratic order in the gradient of the phase .",

    "we will see below that this contribution describes an effective _ off - set charge _ ( in terms of the terminology of a similar josephson junction array scenario ) and which arises from the total fermionic and bosonic static density distribution via their dependence on the chemical potential .",

    "now let us consider the dynamics of such objects and under which conditions they can be rendered itinerant in a way which leaves the number of bonding configurations unchanged .",
    "the problem is thus analogous to that of domain wall dynamics in an ising type systems .",
    "it so happens ( a detailed discussion of this is beyond the scope of the present study and will be given at a later stage elsewhere ) , that the local degeneracy of the non - bonding states will be removed by the action of the kinetic term .",
    "in this way it induces a global lowering of their excitation energy due to the dispersion of each domain wall which is of the form @xmath239\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where @xmath240 . only after the condensation of the domain wall like excitations in the presence of the bonding state background one can meet the conditions for setting up long range boson and fermion - pair phase correlations .",
    "this simple sketch of the nature of the excitations in the bfm implies that the onset of phase coherence can not be activated for an arbitrarily small hopping amplitude since one has to overcome the energy gap between the ground state and the manifold of non - bonding states , which is of the order of @xmath241 . as we can see from the expression for the dispersion of the domain walls ,",
    "this is achieved when @xmath242 becomes zero for @xmath243 , i.e. , when @xmath244 . for z=2",
    "this gives @xmath245 , which determines when those defects - like excitations become gapless and thus induce a proliferation within the background of the bonding states .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this value for the critical exchange coupling matches rather well the value obtained from our functional integral approach discussed in this paper ( see fig 3 ) .    the picture which hence emerges for the bfm is very similar to that of a xy model in a transverse field .",
    "there , the hopping term is responsible of the xy dynamics , while the local boson - fermion pair exchange provides the role of the effective transverse field .",
    "this itself is already a strong indication that this model is of different nature to that of the negative - u hubbard scenario , for which we know that it is , on the contrary , akin to an isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "a further essential difference between the bfm and the negative - u hubbard model can be seen from their respective path - integral formulations . when the path integral representation is considered for this model@xcite ,",
    "the first step is to make use of a hubbard - stratonovich transformation to rewrite the quartic interaction term in a bilinear form , where the fermionic operators are now coupled to random auxiliary fields . limiting oneself to purely superconducting order , the usual procedure for manipulating such a bilinear action is to separate the complex auxiliary field into its modulus and a pure phase part before performing an expansion around the saddle point solution for the amplitude of this auxiliary field .",
    "this way of proceeding allows then to extract an effective action for the slow phase dynamics .",
    "this is distinctly different from the functional integral representation for the bfm which we have presented above and where from the very beginning and throughout such a procedure the fermionic pair fields are coupled to physically real bosonic modes which have their own proper dynamics .",
    "as we have seen in section iii , the bosonic part of the action is treated within a coherent pseudo - spin representation where the dynamics of the pseudospin is parameterized by the time dependence of the spherical variables .",
    "the role of the dynamics within the spherical representation of the bosonic field and of the berry phase term ( which is a consequence of the quantum interference in the local pseudospin space ) is a distinct feature of this bfm and presents specific differences with respect to the negative - u model .",
    "such differences imply in particular that in the bfm case one has feedback effects between the amplitude and the phase fluctuations which are totally absent in an equivalent description of the negative - u hubbard model .",
    "such features are important because of intrinsic dissipation effects that eventually can change the nature of the transition and possibly are relevant for the emergence of a `` bosonic metal '' in proximity of the sit , a feature which seems to be outside the framework of the negative - u hubbard model .",
    "let us conclude this comparison of the bfm with similar models with a brief discussion on the bose - hubbard model and josephson junction arrays .",
    "the main aspect which emerges as a common denominator in all those models , at least as far as the phenomenon of the sit is concerned , is that the mechanism which is responsible for the degrading of the phase coherence is analogous and originates from the competition between the phase and charge degrees of freedom . in the bose - hubbard model",
    "this manifests itself as a competition between the boson hopping and their charge repulsion , while in the josephson junction array scenario it appears as an interplay between the josephson tunnelling amplitude and the charging energy .    in spite of this , at first sight , similarity between the bfm and those scenarios , we would like to stress that in a system where the dynamics is described by the bfm scenario , the interplay between the phase and amplitude fluctuations is intrinsically related to the coupling between the fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "this introduces amplitudes of the different processes at work in form of a non - trivial dependence on the microscopic parameters of the starting hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , as we have seen in the above discussion of the effective action of the bfm , this model contains features which go beyond those which characterize the pure josephson - type dynamics and which arise from the peculiar feedback between the fluctuations of the bosonic density ( or amplitude pair field ) and fluctuations of the phase .",
    "last not least , the appearance of an intrinsic berry phase - term in the bfm scenario together with the effect of dissipation due to the fermionic dynamics , can give rise to an unconventional phenomenology when topological phases play a role , and especially in the presence of vortices .",
    "in this paper we examined the nature of a superconductor - insulator transition in a system of localized bosons and itinerant fermions coupled together via a pair exchange term .",
    "an effective action was derived from such a microscopic model , which , after integrating out the fermionic fields , could be phrased in terms of amplitude and phase fluctuations of the bosons . in order to make the presentation more familiar we discussed the action in a terminology frequently employed in connection with the study of josephson junction arrays .",
    "we stress that our system does not necessarily imply any charged fermions and bosons .    considering the phase - only part of the effective action it is fully equivalent to the quantum phase model for the josephson junction arrays , discussed in terms of : ( i ) a _ josephson coupling _ term , ( ii ) a _ charging or capacitance _ term and ( iii ) an _ offset charge _ term .",
    "equivalent to that in our scenario is : ( i ) a boson hopping term , ( ii ) a term which takes into account the reduction in hopping amplitude due to a fluctuating local boson density arising from the intrinsic on - site exchange coupling between the bosons and the fermions and ( iii ) a chemical potential term controlling the bosonic concentration .",
    "new in the present study within already the lowest ( phase - only ) approach to the boson - fermion system is the intricacy of the dependence of the effective josephson coupling , the capacitance term and the off - set charge term on the parameters of the initial hamiltonian , i.e. , the exchange coupling and the density of bosons ( or else the total particle density ) .",
    "it turns out that within the lowest ( phase - only ) contribute a superconductor to insulator transition can not only be triggered by a change in the exchange coupling but also by a variation of the boson density .",
    "the latter presents evidently a certain interest from the experimental point of view and can possibly be tested in such transition occurring in optical lattices for ultracold fermi gases with feshbach resonance pairing .    apart from the phase - only part of the effective action we established the existence of an intrinsic berry phase term , which arises from the hard core nature of the bosons and gives rise to an additional magnus force when the system is such that topological ground state configurations like vortices are stabilized .",
    "this again is of potential interest for experiments since in principle one can change the sign of the magnus force upon changing the density of bosons and thus deviating the motion of a vortex from one direction into the opposite one .",
    "these very preliminary results will be dealt with in greater detail in some future studies .",
    "a further property of the berry phase term is that it gives rise to a bilinear coupling term between the phase and amplitude fluctuations , and is hence much more direct and relevant than similar terms in , for instance , scenarios based on the negative - u hubbard model where they occur only at a much higher order in a corresponding loop expansion of the trace in the effective action .",
    "this again merits to be investigated in some detail with the aim to study the dissipation introduced by such amplitude phase coupling and its effect on the nature of the transition , in view of exploring the possibility of an intermediary bosonic metallic ground state .",
    "finally , we have dealt with a frequently asked question concerning the differences between the negative - u hubbard scenario - mainly studied in connection with the bcs - bec cross - over and the presently studied boson - fermion model .",
    "far from being able to give a complete account for the major differences we found mainly two aspects which distinguish the physics of these models on a qualitative and robust level .",
    "the one is that in the negative - u hubbard model a superconductor - insulator transition can not take place at any finite coupling u , nor can such a transition be triggered by the change in particle concentration .",
    "the second point is that the ground states in the strong coupling limit of the two models are quite different : a highly degenerate ground state for the negative - u hubbard model with excitations being controlled by an isotropic heisenberg model when the hopping term is switched on .",
    "contrary to that , for the boson fermion model the ground state is non - degenerate ( corresponding to a ferro pseudo - magnetic ising type system of singlets formed by bosons and fermion pairs ) , which , after switching on the fermion hopping term , gives rise to propagating domain like structures .",
    "the topological structures appearing in the ground state might have measurable consequences in the transport properties near the superconductor - insulator transition .",
