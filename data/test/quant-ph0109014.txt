    "real quantum systems are always coupled to environments .",
    "research in the last two or three decades has shown that system  environment interactions greatly affect quantal coherences in the system .",
    "open - system dynamics can often be described by a master equation for the reduced density matrix of the system .",
    "the full hamiltonian is written as the sum of system - only , environment - only and system  environment interaction terms .",
    "the master equation for the system then depends on the system - only hamiltonian plus other terms derived from the fundamental system  environment couplings .",
    "these additional pieces induce an effective non - unitary evolution for the system that can , for example , lead to an apparent loss of quantal coherence .    in many studies ,",
    "the system - only hamiltonian is taken to be the sum of one - body terms .",
    "an example of relevance to this paper arises for a system of @xmath0 particles , each in a one - dimensional symmetric double well .",
    "the system hamiltonian @xmath1 describes particle @xmath2 oscillating with frequency @xmath3 between the left and right sides of its well independently of the other particles in the system . when system  environment coupling is added , this behaviour can be drastically modified , with the quantum zeno @xcite or freezing phenomenon being the most extreme example .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to contribute to a study of closed and open quantum system evolution that goes beyond one - body system hamiltonians by including interaction terms between the system particles .",
    "this is a vast and extremely rich field of enquiry , with many possible lines of development . for reasons to be explained below we will focus on two topics .",
    "the first is entanglement creation through adiabatic evolution and its degradation due to environmental influences .",
    "the second is quantum information error protection through adiabatic evolution .",
    "common to both topics is the use of adiabatic avoided level crossing dynamics .",
    "this special case of quantum mechanical time evolution has applications in diverse areas of physics , from the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein effect for neutrino oscillations @xcite to quantum computation @xcite .",
    "we use it here because it allows non - trivial dynamics to occur while retaining both an element of theoretical simplicity plus visualisability with the aid of level crossing diagrams .    whenever one has more than a single particle in one s quantum system , entanglement adds spice to the analysis .",
    "entangled states are a unique feature of quantum mechanics , first studied in connection with the issue of non - locality @xcite .",
    "they are also of critical importance in discussions of decoherence , measurement and the quantum - to - classical transition @xcite .",
    "more recently , entanglement has emerged as a useful resource in the field of quantum information theory , enabling processes such as quantum cryptography @xcite and teleportation @xcite .",
    "the production and manipulation of entangled states is a key element in any realisation of a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "as our first topic , we describe an efficient method for the preparation of entangled states which utilises the level crossing structure of the system s energy eigenstates .",
    "specifically , we discuss the bell states in the case of a bipartite system , @xmath4 states in a tripartite system and generalised @xmath5 states in multi - partite systems .",
    "we then subject the evolving systems to environmental interactions that affect the entanglement production process .",
    "we show that the outcome depends on the form of system - environment coupling : entanglement degradation is the generic effect , but the special case of `` motional narrowing '' noise actually leads to zero degradation .",
    "calculations presented in ref.@xcite simply took initial bell states and computed the evolution of entanglement in the presence of environmental noise .",
    "the present work is a natural extension of this .    as a separate but related topic , we show that a method of error protection using entangled states emerges from a variation of the above procedure .",
    "we devise a scheme to protect the information encoded in a single qubit from bitflip and phaseflip errors .",
    "our goal is to construct a master equation which seamlessly joins the dynamics of qubit encoding , error protection and decoding to the environment - coupling influences responsible for error generation .",
    "while the outcome of the open system evolution can be dissected into these quantum information theoretic subprocesses , the actual dynamics is simply what you get when you solve a certain master equation .",
    "the building block for our multi - partite systems is the two - state system of a particle in a one - dimensional double well , chosen for its generic properties and broad interest ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the well is taken to be partitioned by a barrier of height @xmath6 that is large compared to the ground state energy @xmath7 .",
    "( the two lowest energy levels will be collectively called the `` ground state '' . for a symmetric",
    "well with @xmath8 they are nearly degenerate . ) adopting quantum information theoretic parlance , we denote by `` qubits '' the states occupying the two - dimensional hilbert space spanned by the left and right sides of the well ( in the ground state ) .",
    "the left and right eigenstates , denoted @xmath9 and @xmath10 , correspond to the @xmath11 and @xmath12 eigenvalues of @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "for an isolated well , the hamiltonian has the form @xmath14 where the energy splitting @xmath15 is essentially a tunneling rate between the two sides of the well , and the parameter @xmath16 is the well bias .",
    "we begin with a bipartite two - state system , the simplest system in which one may discuss entanglement .",
    "our aim here is to produce one of the bell states , @xmath17 dynamically from certain initially factorisable states .",
    "let us denote the two - particle ( reduced ) density matrix of qubits 1 and 2 as @xmath18 and consider a hamiltonian of the form presented in eq .",

    "[ 2qubit ] .",
    "hence , an initial state @xmath33 created at @xmath34 will continue to reside in the lowest energy eigenstate provided that @xmath16 varies sufficiently slowly with time , and be adiabatically transformed , across point @xmath31 , to the entangled state @xmath35 where @xmath36 corresponds to any point in the period of time during which @xmath16 lies in the range @xmath37 .",
    "further adiabatic evolution beyond point @xmath32 will turn @xmath38 once more into a factorisable state @xmath39 .",

    "figure [ ent ] illustrates the evolution of the entanglement for @xmath38 , and we remind the reader again that the bell state @xmath21 can not be generated in this manner because of symmetry requirements . in this figure , the degree of entanglement is defined to be the _ entropy of entanglement _",

    "note that if the two qubits had different oscillations frequences , @xmath48 , mixing between the almost degenerate states @xmath49 is not prohibited by permutation symmetry ( or the lack thereof ) . in this case",

    "observe that if we had started instead in the state @xmath27 which is approximately the highest energy eigenstate , we could in principle obtain the entangled state @xmath51 at the point @xmath50 .",
    "however , an inspection of the hamiltonian @xmath52 rewritten in the symmetrised basis @xmath53 , shows that the splitting between the relevant energy eigenstates for the @xmath54 transition at @xmath50 is of order @xmath55 , as opposed to @xmath56 for the @xmath57 transition considered earlier .",
    "it follows that the resonance width at point @xmath58 is necessarily some @xmath59 times narrower than those at points @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "their respective adiabaticity parameters , defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the splitting between the energy eigenstates , `` res '' denotes evaluated at resonance , and @xmath62 indicates an adiabatic process , must also differ correspondingly by some factor of @xmath63 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath64 characterise the three resonances .    hence , in order to manufacture the state @xmath51 , a slowly varying @xmath16 together with control over its accuracy to within @xmath65 are necessary .",
    "navely , the severity of the precision requirement seems easily alleviated by enlarging @xmath15 .",
    "the benefit of a wider resonance width , however , is compensated for by a concomitant increase in the contamination from the @xmath28 state which contributes at order @xmath59 . by comparison ,",
    "the production of @xmath28 from @xmath42 requires only that we stop the evolution somewhere between @xmath66 , and is therefore a much simpler task .      in the presence of environmentally - induced noise",
    ", we must solve a master equation for the reduced density matrix of the system .",
    "the form of the master equation depends on whether or not the environment is hot enough to induce transitions to excited states of the double wells .",
    "we first consider coupling to a cold environment , so that each particle remains in the ground state of its double well .",
    "the evolution of @xmath67 is governed by @xmath68 -\\gamma_{\\text{relax}}[\\zeta , [ \\zeta , \\rho ] ] -\\gamma_{\\text{relax}}[\\zeta ' , [ \\zeta ' , \\rho]],\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are hermitian matrices obtained from the system - environment interaction hamiltonian . for the sake of the example",
    ", we will choose @xmath71 , @xmath72 , which means that the relaxation terms arise from a system  bath interaction that couples to the left states @xmath73 but not to the right states @xmath74 . and",

    "we will return to this point shortly . ] commencing with a pure state @xmath42 and a small relaxation rate @xmath75 , we show in fig .  [ noise ] the evolution of the entanglement with the course of time .",
    "a `` decay '' in @xmath43 in the period @xmath66 is evident . for a sufficiently large @xmath75 ,",
    "the density matrix simply becomes proportional to the unit matrix , and the entanglement goes to zero at all times .",
    "we now consider coupling to an environment hot enough that the system - bath interactions will cause particles in the wells to populate states higher than the ground state . in a previous publication we considered in detail the effects of noise coming from a thermal bath coupled to the full excited state spectrum of a double well @xcite . among the cases considered was the effect of `` side - blind '' noise on a number of properties of the system .",
    "for the side - blind case , the bath couples _ equally _ to the left states @xmath76 and the right states @xmath77 .",
    "if we begin with a single particle on the left in the ground state of the symmetrical well , the thermal excitation of states that have very different r - l oscillation frequencies replaces with a multiperiodic tangle the previous simple oscillation of the probability of finding the particle on the left at a later time .",
    "the effect of a small system - bath interaction rate is to gradually damp these oscillations , leaving a time independent 50% occupancy on either side . as the ratio of the system - bath interaction rate to the oscillation rate",
    "is increased , however , the motion becomes more organized , and in the limiting case where this ratio becomes very large , limit \" arises when the time between successive system - bath interactions is much smaller than the period of the l - r precession .",
    "observe that this condition can actually be fulfilled for _ any _ value of the coupling ( and importantly , for a coupling sufficiently weak that one may treat it perturbatively in the derivation of the master equation ) by making the free precession period sufficiently large . in the context of a double well oscillator",
    "this is achieved very easily , simply by adjusting the central barrier between the wells .",
    "also note that this  large @xmath78 limit \" is identical to the limit where one obtains the familiar quantum zeno effect , if the coupling to the environment is through a @xmath79 operator rather than the identity .",
    "] we retrieve sinusoidal oscillation with a frequency that is given by the thermal average of the frequencies of the individual levels @xcite .",

    "the l - r oscillation properties for a particular well - level are given by eq .",
    "( [ asnoise ] ) , but the oscillation parameters are different for the excited well states",
    ". we shall refer to the variable distinguishing these states as the `` vertical '' variable , as opposed to the @xmath80 degree of freedom which we will term the `` horizontal '' variable .",
    "we will take the coupling among the vertical levels to again be `` side - blind '' , that is , not dependent on the horizontal variables , because that is the most interesting case .",
    "we can capture the essential features of the problem by considering only two vertical levels , with equal transition rates , @xmath78 , each to the other ( the latter as in the case of a high temperature for the thermal bath ) , in which case we make the replacements in eq.([asnoise ] ) , @xmath81 , @xmath82 on the lefthand side and @xmath83\\rightarrow   \\gamma \\bigr ( \\sum_j\\rho(e_j , t)-2\\rho(e_i , t ) \\bigr)\\ ] ] on the righthand side , as well as specifying , within @xmath84 , different oscillation parameters for the two energy states .    using this equation",
    "we now look at the results for the two particle - entanglement for the cases of zero , moderate , and large system - bath interaction rates .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  4 .",
    "we see substantial degradation of entanglement - formation in the case of moderate interaction rate .",
    "but in the case of large interaction rate , we see a pattern of entanglement creation that is similar to that in the case with no noise . in this limit",
    ", the system is made to change vertical state so rapidly that it can only respond to an average hamiltonian , with quantal coherence fully maintained @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , the entanglement - formation dynamics succeeds in this limit .    for completeness",

    "but even a single redundant parallel channel with the same input data would reduce the probability of information loss to the level of order @xmath173 . since the latter is the essential level of error for the case in which measurement of the control bit gives unity , this is the best result obtainable using our kind of mechanism .    in our numerical example",

    "( [ withnoise ] ) for the density matrix evolution in the presence of noise , beginning at time @xmath110 and ending at time @xmath126 , without breaking into the separate factors of the discussion above .",

    "c ) the terms of higher order in @xmath172 , which matter when the probability of more than one error during the time @xmath112 becomes appreciable . for our example , we choose the initial state for the information bit to be simply @xmath76 .",
    "figure [ error ] shows the probability of a bit flip error arising from an error operator @xmath174 plotted as a function of the average number of applications of the error , @xmath172 , and on the same plot the results for the case in which the information is not encoded .",
    "we have also checked numerically to see that in cases in which we begin with a superposition of @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the information bit , and fine tune @xmath175 to an appropriate value , the entire state , including the relative phase angle in the superposition , is preserved to the same degree as the bit - error values plotted in fig .",

    "we have considered two related topics in the study of closed and open quantum system evolution that go beyond one - body system hamiltonians by including interaction terms between the system particles . in the first topic ,",
    "we have shown that entangled states that are symmetric under the permutation of the basis states can be generated via adiabatic transitions from initially factorisable states which have this symmetry . in a two - qubit system ,",
    "the outcome is the symmetrical bell state @xmath176 , while the three - qubit analogue is the set of two @xmath4 states .",
    "noise in moderate quantitites generally reduces entanglement over time , and for such cases the limit of large noise sees entanglement remaining zero at all times .",
    "however , for the special case of `` side - blind '' noise that leads to motional narrowing , the creation of entanglement is preserved despite a large system - environment interaction rate .    in our second topic , we have shown that for small noise levels , we can use an entangling - pause - unentangling cycle to store and recover quantum data in a two qubit system , with error probability quadratic rather than linear in the parameter @xmath177 where @xmath78 is the error rate for unencoded data and @xmath36 is the time elapsed .",
    "calculations of encoding that utilise the entanglement give a concrete demonstration of the compatibility of two requirements on the encoding time : a ) that it be long enough achieve adiabaticity ; b ) that it be short enough to limit the effects of noise during the encoding process .",
