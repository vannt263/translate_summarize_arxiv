    "in the last decade , much attention has been devoted to the quantum engineering of nonclassical light .",
    "different types of nonclassical states can be now prepared , and their quantum properties can be entirely characterized by accessible measurement schemes . among the various quantum states of the optical field , states with a definite number of photons",
    "deserve a special attention .",
    "indeed , besides the interest for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics @xcite , the fock ( number ) states are also relevant for many applications , as for example , to achieve the optimal capacity coding in quantum communication channels @xcite , or the heisenberg sensitivity limit in high - precision quantum interferometry @xcite .",
    "different methods for the generation of fock states have been proposed , both for traveling - wave and cavity fields . for traveling - wave fields ,",
    "these methods are principally based on tailored nonlinear interactions @xcite , conditional measurements @xcite , or state engineering @xcite .",
    "the experimental realizability or effectiveness of these proposals is often challenging . on the other hand ,",
    "fock states have been generated into cavities @xcite",
    ", i.e. using the micromaser trapped states .    in this paper",
    "we address the problem of fock state generation in a traveling mode .",
    "we suggest an optical device based on an avalanche triggering photodetector and a ring cavity coupled to an external traveling wave through a cross - kerr medium . remarkably , the input states of our proposal are just customary coherent states .",
    "our scheme differs from conventional setups involving conditional photon counters @xcite , since we use simple on  off detection of an intense coherent field , allowing very low quantum efficiency at the photodetector . moreover , as we will see , the scheme can also be used to engineer superpositions of few fock states , which are a crucial resource for optical quantum computers @xcite , and quantum tomography of optical hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the main advantages of the present scheme are its tunability in preparing any chosen number state and selected superpositions , along with its robustness against the imperfections of the triggering photodetector .",
    "indeed , low quantum efficiency at the photodetector has no detrimental effect on the filtering process , but only reduces the state - synthesizing rate .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "the scheme is introduced , and its use in preparing fock states is described . in section [",
    "s : sup ] we show how the same scheme can be used to prepare superpositions of few fock states , whereas in section [ s : eta ] the effects of non - unit quantum efficiency at the photodetector are taken into account .",
    "section [ s : outro ] closes the paper by summarizing results , and discussing the feasibility of the scheme .",
    "the schematic setup of the synthesizer is depicted in fig . [",

    "the ring cavity is build by two mirrors and two high reflectivity beam splitters . here , for simplicity",
    ", we suppose that the beam splitters have the same transmissivity @xmath0 .",
    "the cavity is fed by a coherent state in the mode @xmath1 , whereas the mode @xmath2 is left unexcited . through the cross - kerr interaction , the cavity mode @xmath3",
    "is coupled to an external traveling mode @xmath4 , according to the unitary evolution @xcite @xmath5 @xmath6 being the nonlinear susceptibility of the medium and @xmath7 the interaction time .",
    "the signal mode @xmath4 is prepared in a coherent state , and , additionally , a tunable phase shift @xmath8 is introduced in the cavity mode .",
    "the scheme is suitable for applications with both continuous waves and pulses . in a situation involving pulses , however , in order have states with a definite number of photons we need a long enough quantization time . indeed",
    ", the coherence time of the signal mode should be quite long compared to the probe one .",
    "we assume that the coherence time of the input signal is of the order of the photon flight time in the cavity , thus assuring that the cavity mode effectively couples with the signal through the cross - kerr medium .",
    "moreover , the coherence time of the cavity mode should be shorter than the signal one , thus allowing the kerr phase to cumulate in the loop . in summary",
    ", the coherence time of the probe mode should be shorter than the signal one , which , in turn , is determined by the photon flight time in the cavity .    at the output of the cavity the field",
    "is monitored by an avalanche photodetector . for the purpose of our scheme",
    ", we only need to verify the presence or absence of the field , at the output port of the cavity through the triggering photodiode d. let us initially assume unit quantum efficiency at photodetection .",
    "the measurement is described by the two - value probability operator measure ( pom ) @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the vacuum and @xmath12 is the identity for mode @xmath13 . as we will show in the following , due to the very steep dependence of the cavity transmissivity on the total phase shift  including both cross kerr interaction and phase @xmath8the detection of the field at photodetector d guarantees that the free mode @xmath14 at the output of the kerr medium is reduced into a fock state or a superposition of few fock states .",

    "it is worth noting that the coefficients of the superposition in eq .",
    "( [ s4 ] ) are selected by the input state @xmath24 .",

    "in fact , @xmath76 scales the term @xmath82 in the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ strainereta1 ] ) , thus lowering the off - resonance contributions . in fig .",
    "[ f : offeta]a we actually purify the superposition shown in fig . [",
    "f : off]a by lowering the quantum efficiency to the value @xmath83 .",
    "the probability of obtaining the state is correspondingly lowered from the value @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
    "an analogous argument holds for the dependence of the output state @xmath86 on the input coherent amplitude @xmath44 . in fig .",
    "[ f : offeta]b we report the conditional state obtained by choosing @xmath87 , which corresponds to the same detection probability @xmath88 . obviously the above discussion on the effect of non - unit quantum efficiency and on the intensity of the input coherent state @xmath25 holds also for the generation of single fock states .",
    "the present proposal is characterized by two relevant features : its tunability in the preparation of any chosen number state and of selected superpositions , and its robustness against the imperfections of the photodetection process .",
    "therefore , it is a matter of interest to discuss its feasibility in practical applications .",
    "this mostly depends on two parameters : the quality factor of the ring cavity ( governed by the beam splitters transmissivity @xmath0 ) and the value of the nonlinear coupling @xmath35 . for a good cavity ( i.e. a cavity with large quality factor )",
    "@xmath0 should be quite small , usual values achievable in quantum optical labs being of the order of @xmath89@xmath90 .",
    "remarkably , losses due to absorption processes are of the order of @xmath91 , at least one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "the scheme also requires an appreciable value for the nonlinear cross - kerr coupling between the signal and the cavity modes .",
    "the coupling can be realized by optical nonlinear couplers , either codirectional or contradirectional , in the case of an all - optical fiber implementation , or by direct matching of modes on a third - order crystal in the case of a free field .",
    "usually , third - order nonlinearities are small , and may be masked by the concurrent self - modulation and absorption processes .",
    "although the effects of self phase modulation can be avoided using resonant @xmath92 media @xcite , currently available nonlinearities can be used in the present scheme only for the preparation of number states @xcite .",
    "however , recent breakthroughs in nonlinear kerr physics @xcite open new perspectives for applications in quantum optics . in fact , methods based on dark atomic resonance and electromagnetically induced transparency have been suggested to strongly enhance nonlinearity while suppressing absorption .",
    "these results ( especially for atomic gases ) indicate that giant kerr nonlinear shifts of the order of 1 radiant per photon may be obtained by methods not too far from present technology @xcite .",
    "as regards the power of the output signal ( and the probe mode ) , we mention that this should not be too large , since the @xmath93-periodic resonance structure of the cavity transmissivity relies on the linear phase - shift imposed to the cavity mode .",
    "if the power is too large the nonlinear contribution drastically alters this situation , and gives rise to bistability or period - doubling instabilities .",
    "the actual value of the allowed power strongly depends on the specific nonlinear crystal employed in the setup .",
    "we do not discuss here the technical details .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have suggested a novel scheme to generate arbitrary optical photon - number eigenstates in a traveling wave mode .",
    "the scheme uses on  off photodetection of the field mode exiting a high - q cavity , which , in turn , is coupled to the traveling - wave by nonlinear kerr interaction .",
    "the input fields for the setup are just customary coherent states . after a successful photodetection",
    ", the traveling mode is found in a photon - number eigenstate , or , for sufficiently high kerr nonlinearity , in a superposition of fock states .",
    "the photodetector is needed just to test the presence of an intense coherent output field and , in fact , we have shown that non - unit quantum efficiency at photodetection improves the quality of the state synthesis , however at the expenses of the synthesizing rate .",
