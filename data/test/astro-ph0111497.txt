    "disc accreting neutron star systems are amongst some of the brightest x  ray sources in the sky .",
    "they can be split into two broad types namely atolls and z sources ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "observationally these differ in that they show distinct types of spectral variability and timing behaviour , which link more fundamentally to a difference in the accretion rate and probably also in magnetic field ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "the atolls have an accretion rate which is typically below @xmath1% of the eddington limit , and have weak magnetic fields while the z sources accrete at @xmath2 % of eddington , and probably have stronger magnetic fields ( e.g. the review by van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "both types generally show 220 kev spectra which exhibit pronounced curvature , probably due to compton scattering of seed photons by electrons with temperature @xmath3 kev ( e.g. white , stella & parmar 1988 ) , except at low luminosity states which are only seen in the atoll systems , where the spectrum makes a transition to a power law ( e.g. mitsuda et al . , 1989 ; van paradijs & van der klis 1994 ; barret et al . , 2000 ) .    here",
    "we concentrate on the x  ray spectra of the z sources . a full description of the accretion flow for these sources should take into account the interaction of the disc with the stellar surface , including the effects of radiation pressure and magnetic field in a relativistic potential .",
    "this is likely to be extremely complex , as shown by initial hydrodynamic ( popham & sunyaev 2001 ; inogamov & sunyaev 1999 ) and magnetohydrodynamic simulations ( miller & stone 1997 )",
    ". the boundary layer / inner disc emission can then illuminate the rest of the disc giving rise to a compton reflected spectrum and associated iron k@xmath4 line from the heated , ionised , upper layer of the disc ( see e.g. the review by fabian et al .",
    ", 2000 , with specific application to z sources by brandt & matt 1994 ) .",
    "given this complexity it is perhaps unsurprising that the observed spectra from z sources ( and atolls ) have proved difficult to fit ( e.g. mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ; white , stella & parmar 1988 ) .",
    "this led to the widespread use of colour  colour diagrams as opposed to true spectral fitting . here",
    "we show that previous difficulties were mainly caused by using poor approximations for the comptonised and reflected emission components .",
    "we include relativistic smearing ( fabian et al . , 1989 ) of the disc emission as the source of the line broadening ( which is otherwise very difficult to explain ) and",
    "derive excellent fits to the ginga spectra of cyg x2 at all points on its z track .",
    "x  rays can arise from a variety of processes from accretion onto a low magnetic field neutron star . there can be components from the neutron star surface , the boundary layer and the x  ray illuminated disc , and these should be subject to general and special relativistic effects .",
    "the thermal emission from the neutron star surface is probably buried beneath a very optically thick boundary layer at the high mass accretion rates seen in the z sources ( popham & sunyaev 2001 ) , leaving only the disc and boundary layer as the major emission components .",
    "the energy release in the boundary layer heats the material , which then cools predominantly by comptonization of any seed photons .",
    "the seed photons can either be from the disc , or from the neutron star surface , or from self  absorbed cyclo / synchrotron photons from the magnetic field ( lamb 1989 ; psaltis , lamb & miller 1995 but see wardzinski & zdziarski 1999 ) .",
    "the resulting spectrum is then either clearly comptonised , or quasi ",
    "blackbody if the optical depth is large enough to mostly thermalise the emission ( saturated comptonization ) .",
    "further compton scattering , including bulk motion effects , can take place if the accreting material has a substantial scale height , so that the emission from the boundary layer has to travel through this infalling material before it can escape to the observer ( lamb 1989 ; psaltis et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "the boundary layer can directly illuminate some fraction of the disc .",
    "part of the illuminating flux is reflected ( smale et al 1993 ; brandt & matt 1994 ) , while the rest is thermalised , enhancing the disc emission ( e.g. czerny , czerny & grindley 1986 ) .",
    "this heats the upper layers of the disc to the compton temperature of around 12 kev .",
    "this exceeds the virial temperature at distances @xmath5 cm for a @xmath6 neutron star , so the material escapes as a wind forming a corona around the outer accretion disc ( begelman , mckee & shields 1983 ) .",
    "this accretion disc corona ( adc ) is especially important in determining the observational appearance of the highly inclined systems , where the intrinsic , central source is hidden by the disc but can be seen via scattering in this tenuous material above and below the disc ( e.g. white , nagase & parmar 1995 ) . the photo  ionised adc emits line and continuum radiation , and can also scatter some of the boundary layer / inner disc emission back onto the disc , increasing the illumination ( e.g. vrtilek , soker & raymond 1993 ) . even at somewhat smaller radii the x ",
    "ray illumination heats the upper layers of the discs , so it has an appreciably larger scale height than an unilluminated disc , although the stronger gravity means that it can not escape to form a wind . the emission from this photo  ionised ,",
    "heated layer consists of recombination features ( line and continuum radiation ) together with the reflection of some fraction of the incident x ",
    "rays from the disc ( kallman & white 1989 ; vrtilek , soker & raymond 1993 ; ko & kallman 1994 ) .",
    "from the discussion above , the spectrum should consist of components from the disc and boundary layer , together with reflection from the disc and scattering / emission / absorption from the adc .",
    "generally progress is made by estimating which components dominate so as to form a simplified model which nonetheless describes most of the physical processes .",
    "this is where the problems arise as there is no consensus on which effects dominate .",
    "one approach to modelling the spectra ( generally called the ` eastern model ' in the literature ) assumes that an optically thick disc dominates at low energies , while a comptonised boundary layer dominates at higher energies .",
    "this was developed by mitsuda et al . ,",
    "( 1984 ; 1989 ) , and fits the data well with the addition of a _ broad _ iron k@xmath4 line ( white , peacock & taylor 1985 ; hirano et al . , 1987 ; asai et al . , 2000 ) .    however , spectral fitting is inherently non  unique , and another approach is to assume that the majority of the emission at both high and low energies comes from a comptonised disc , while the boundary layer emits as a quasi ",
    "blackbody in the middle of this energy range ( white et al . , 1988 ) .",
    "such models ( generally termed ` western ' models ) can fit the data equally well , but again require the inclusion of a broad iron line component ( white et al .",
    ", 1988 ; mitsuda et al . , 1989 ; hasinger et al . ,",
    "1990 ) .    here , we follow the eastern approach , as it seems most likely that the boundary layer is strongly comptonised ( popham & sunyaev 2001 ) .",
    "we assume that the low energy x  ray continuum is dominated by the disc , but the disc spectrum is not well known especially at accretion rates close to eddington where radiation pressure must be important .",
    "the radial temperature distribution depends on whether the viscosity is proportional to the gas pressure or the total ( gas plus radiation ) pressure ( stella & rosner 1984 ) . electron scattering in the atmosphere is also expected to be important , leading to weak comptonization of the disc emission ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , and the intrinsic disc spectrum should be further broadened by relativistic effects ( ebisawa et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "detailed calculations of these distortions show that with a restricted bandpass , where only the high energy tail of the disc spectrum is seen , then the shape of the spectrum can be well approximated by a simple multi  colour disc model with a colour temperature correction ( ebisawa et al . , 1991",
    "; shimura & takahara 1995 ; merloni et al .",
    "thus we approximate the disc spectrum by the diskbb model in xspec , but also test that this assumption does not strongly bias our results by using other disc spectral models .",
    "we assume that the seed photons for the comptonization in the boundary layer come from the neutron star surface as well as the inner disc , so they can be at higher energies than the observed disc emission .",
    "the typical temperatures expected from close to the neutron star at high mass accretion rates are @xmath0  kev , i.e. within the observed x  ray bandpass .",
    "simple analytic approximations ( e.g. the compst model or a cutoff power law ) for the compton scattered spectrum are only valid where the seed photon energy is very much lower than that of the hot electrons ( e.g. hua & titarchuk 1995 ) .",
    "explicit seed photon comptonization models are required ( such as the comptt model in xspec ) , and these give spectra with significantly different curvature close to the seed photon energies .",
    "such models are starting to be used to fit broad band ( generally sax ) data from z and atoll systems ( guainazzi et al .",
    ", 1998 ; piraino et al 1999 ; int zand et al . , 1999 ; di salvo et al . , 2000 ; 2001 )",
    "the assumption in comptt is that the seed photons have a wien distribution . here instead we assume that the seed photons have a blackbody distribition and use an analytic approximation to the comptonisation based on the solution of kompaneets equation ( zdziarski , johnson & magdziarz 1996 ) , as described in , done & smith ( 1999 ) .",
    "this comptonising cloud around the neutron star can illuminate the accretion disc , ionising it and producing a characteristic reflected component and iron k@xmath4 line .",
    "this was first detected in active galactic nuclei , and extensively studied both in supermassive and in in galactic black holes ( see e.g. fabian et al . , 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "however , its application to spectra from neutron star systems is much less widespread .",
    "the atoll systems at low mass accretion rate have power law spectra in the 220 kev range , and reflection is sometimes included to fit these data ( yoshida et al . , 1993 ; piraino et al 1999 ; barret et al .",
    ", 2000 ) . however , the curving spectra from higher accretion rate atolls and z sources have not been fit with reflection models despite observational ( smale et al . ,",
    "1993 ) and theoretical ( brandt & matt 1994 ) motivation .",
    "another issue of importance in modelling the reflected spectrum is relativistic smearing .",
    "the disc extends down close to the surface of the neutron star , so reflection from the _ inner _ disc with relativistic distortions on both the line and reflected continuum should be important ( fabian et al 1989 ) .",
    "this has been seen in agn ( tanaka et al . , 1995 ) and galactic black hole candidates ( , done & smith 1997 ; 1998 ; 1999 ; done &  1999 ) but again has not been studied in high mass accretion rate neutron star systems . instead the observed strong broad line at 67 kev ( white et al . , 1985 ; hirano et al . , 1987 ; asai et al . 2000 )",
    "is generally interpreted as arising from the adc and illuminated _",
    "outer _ disc ( kallman & white 1989 ; raymond 1993 ) , although it is very difficult to make both the observed line intensity and width from such a corona ( see e.g. the discussion in smale et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "we calculate the reflected emission from the thcomp continuum as described in  et al . , ( 1999 ) .",
    "this calculates the self consistent line emission as well as the angle dependent reflected continuum for any ionization state and iron abundance ( all the other elements are assumed to have solar abundance : morrison & mccammon 1983 ) .",
    "relativistic smearing ( including light bending ) is then applied to this total ( line plus continuum ) spectrum ( fabian et al . , 1989 ) .",
    "the resultant spectrum depends on the inclination , which we fix at @xmath7 ( orosz & kuulkers 1999 ) .",
    "we assume that emission / absorption / scattering from the adc above the outer disc is negligible .",
    "this is probably not the case for the low energy spectrum , as line emission is seen at @xmath8 kev in several lmxb s ( e.g. bautista et al . , 1998 and references therein ) including cyg x2 ( kuulkers et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "however , here we are concerned with the 220 kev spectrum , and the iron k line associated with the adc is probably small as the k / l line ratio is low for the steep spectra characteristic of the z sources ( kallman 1995 ) .",
    "c    .ginga observations of cyg x2 in june 1988 [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the spectrum of cyg x2 has complex curvature which makes spectral fitting highly non  unique . it is generally agreed that the x  ray spectrum must consist of at least two components , the disc and the boundary layer , and that at least one of these ( though more probably both ) is comptonised .",
    "in addition , there are spectral features corresponding to ionised iron k , which are often modelled as a broad gaussian line .",
    "we have shown that the derived spectral parameters are crucially dependent on how the comptonised spectrum is modelled .",
    "the often used compst or cutoff power law models are physically inconsistent since the seed photons for the compton scattering _ must _ be in the observed x  ray range , whether they come from the disc or the boundary layer .",
    "the lack of curvature in compst or cutoff power laws at energies below the electron temperature then forces a blackbody at @xmath8 kev into the fit .",
    "this is purely an artifact of incorrect modelling of the comptonised spectrum and has _ no _ physical relation to the boundary layer or neutron star surface .",
    "when the comptonised spectrum is modelled including this curvature ( using thcomp or comptt ) then the spectrum is adequately fit either by assuming that the boundary layer is comptonised , and the softer emission is from the accretion disc ( diskbb+thcomp+gau @xmath9 ) or that the disc spectrum is comptonised , and the boundary layer is a blackbody ( bb+thcomp+gau @xmath10 ) .",
    "the ginga data can not distinguish between these models statistically .",
    "however , there are some theoretical constraints on the ratio of the disc and boundary layer fluxes . in the ` eastern model ' , where the boundary layer is comptonised , we derive a boundary layer luminosity which is about twice that of the luminosity of the disc .",
    "this is as expected in the general relativistic models of the gravitational potential if the neutron star spin is not close to the keplarian breakup frequency ( sunyaev & shakura 1986 ) .",
    "by contrast , in the ` western model ' where the disc is strongly comptonised , the ratio of the boundary layer blackbody luminosity to that from the disc is @xmath11 , implying that the neutron star is significantly spun up .",
    "detailed calculations indicate that to get a ratio of boundary layer to disc flux this low requires that the spin frequency of the neutron star is @xmath12 khz ( sibgatullin & sunyaev 2000 ) .",
    "this seems excessive : all known millisecond pulsars ( the descendants of the lmxb neutron stars ) have spin frequencies @xmath13 hz ( e.g. kramer et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "thus it seems likely that the ` eastern ' model ( mitsuda et al .",
    ", 1984 ; 1989 ) is correct and that the boundary layer dominates the hard spectrum , while the disc dominates at softer energies .",
    "a standard objection to this approach , that in general the derived disc parameters require an emitting area which is far too small to be a true disc ( e.g. church & balucinska ",
    "church 2001 ) , is again purely an artifact of incorrect modelling of the curvature due to the seed photons in the comptonised continuum ."
