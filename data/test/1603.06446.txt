    "it is an important task to visualize , understand and then extract useful information in complex continuous dynamical systems from many science and engineering fields including flight simulation @xcite , wave propagation @xcite , bio - inspired fluid flow motions @xcite , ocean current model @xcite , and etc .",
    "it is , therefore , natural to see many existing tools to study dynamical systems .",
    "for example , a lot of work in dynamical systems focuses on understanding different types of behaviors in a model , such as elliptical zones , hyperbolic trajectories , chaotic attractors , mixing regions , to name just a few .",
    "one interesting tool is to partition the space - time domain into subregions based on certain quantity measured along with the passive tracer advected according to the associated dynamical system . because of such a lagrangian property in the definition , the corresponding partition is named the lagrangian coherent structure ( lcs ) .",
    "one commonly used quantity is the so - called finite time lyapunov exponent ( ftle ) @xcite which measures the rate of separation of a passive tracer with an infinitesimal perturbation in the initial condition , over a finite period of time .",
    "another popular diagnostic of trajectory separation in dynamical systems is the finite - size lyapunov exponent ( fsle ) @xcite which is especially popular in the applications from the oceanography . instead of introducing an infinitesimal perturbation in the initial condition of the fluid particles",
    ", fsle considers finite perturbation .",
    "it does not measure the rate of separation but computes the time required to separate two adjacent tracers up to certain distance .",
    "since all these quantities are long treated as a lagrangian property of a continuous dynamical system , most , if not all , numerical methods are developed based on the traditional lagrangian ray tracing method by solving the ode system using any well - developed numerical integrator .",
    "these approaches , however , require the velocity field defined at arbitrary locations in the whole space depending on the location of each individual particle .",
    "this implies that one has to in general implement some interpolation routines in the numerical code .",
    "unfortunately , it could be numerically challenging to develop an interpolation approach which is computationally cheap , monotone , and high order accurate .",
    "an eulerian approach to the flow map computation for the ftle has been first proposed in @xcite which has incorporated the level set method @xcite .",
    "based on the phase flow method @xcite , we have developed a backward phase flow method for the eulerian ftle computations in @xcite . based on these partial differential equation ( pde ) based algorithms , more recently , we have developed in @xcite an efficient eulerian numerical approach for extracting invariant sets in a continuous dynamical system in the extended phase space ( the @xmath1 space ) . in @xcite , we have proposed a simple algorithm called vials which determines the average growth in the surface area of a family of level surfaces .",
    "this eulerian tool relates closely to the ftle and provides an alternative for understanding complicated dynamical systems .    in this paper",
    ", we are going to further develop these eulerian tools for continuous dynamical systems .",
    "there are several main contributions of this paper .",
    "we will first improve the numerical algorithm for _ forward _ flow map construction .",
    "the papers @xcite have proposed to construct the _ forward _ flow map defined on a fixed cartesian mesh by solving the level set equations or the liouville equations in the _ backward _ direction . in particular , to compute the forward flow map from the initial time @xmath2 to the final time @xmath3 , one needs to solve the liouville equations _",
    "backward _ in time from @xmath3 to @xmath2 with the initial condition given at @xmath3 .",
    "this implementation is numerically inconvenient , especially when incorporating with some computational fluid dynamic ( cfd ) solvers , since the velocity field is loaded from the current time @xmath3 backward in time to the initial time .",
    "this implies that the whole field at all time steps has to be stored in the desk which might not be practical at all . in this paper",
    ", we first propose an eulerian approach to compute the _ forward _ flow map _ on the fly _ so that the pde is solved _ forward _ in time .",
    "developed using this improved algorithm , we propose a simple eulerian approach to compute the isle .",
    "for each of the separation factor @xmath0 in the definition of the isle , typical lagrangian method requires to shoot an individual set of rays and to monitor the variations in these trajectories .",
    "if the scale @xmath0 is changed , these methods will require to restart the whole computations all over again .",
    "in this work , we are going to develop an efficient algorithm which provides the isle field for any arbitrary separation factor @xmath0 .",
    "for an individual value of @xmath0 , the method requires to extract only an isosurface of a volumetric data .",
    "this can be done easily by any well - developed interpolation algorithm or simply the function isosurface in matlab .",
    "another main contribution of this work is to provide a theoretical link between the ftle and the isle .",
    "even though these two quantities are measuring different properties of the flow , it has been reported widely , such as @xcite , that they give visually very similar solutions in many examples .",
    "we are going to show in particular that their ridges can be identified through the ridge of the largest eigenvalue of the associated cauchy - green deformation tensor of the flow . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this theoretical result is the first one quantitatively revealing the relationship between the ftle ridges and the isle ridges .",
    "indeed , comparisons between ftle and fsle have been made in various studies .",
    "the paper @xcite has pointed out that the ftle might be unable to recognize the boundaries between the chaotic and the large - scale mixing regime .",
    "the article @xcite has argued that the fsle has several limitations in lagrangian coherence detection including aspects from local ill - posedness , spurious ridges and intrinsic jump - discontinuities .",
    "nevertheless , the work @xcite has stated that these two concepts might yield similar results , if properly calibrated , and could be even interchangeable in many flow visualizatons such as oceanography and chemical kinetics . in this paper , however , we would like to emphasize on the computational aspect of using these lyapunov exponents , rather than on comparing the advantages and the disadvantages of these different methods .",
    "the preference for one or the other could be based on the tradition in various fields , or the availability of the computational resources .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : background ] we will give a summary of several important concepts including the ftle , fsle and isle , and also our original eulerian formulations for computing the flow maps and the ftle . then , our proposed eulerian algorithms will be given in section [ sec : proposal ] .",
    "we will then point out some theoretical properties and relationships between the ftle and the isle in section [ sec : relation ] .",
    "finally , some numerical examples will be given in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "in this section , we will summarize several useful concepts and methods , which will be useful for the developments that we are proposing .",
    "we first introduce the definition of various closely related lyapunov exponents including the finite time lyapunov exponent ( ftle ) @xcite , the finite size lyapunov exponent ( fsle ) @xcite and also the infinitesimal size lyapunov exponent ( isle ) @xcite .",
    "then we discuss typical lagrangian approaches and summarize the original eulerian approaches as in @xcite .",
    "the discussions here , however , will definitely not be a complete survey .",
    "we refer any interested readers to the above references and thereafter .      in this paper , we consider a continuous dynamical system governed by the following ordinary differential equation ( ode ) @xmath4 with the initial condition @xmath5 .",
    "the velocity field @xmath6 is a time dependent lipschitz function where @xmath7 is a bounded domain in the @xmath8-dimensional space . to simplify the notation in the later sections",
    ", we collect the solutions to this ode for all initial conditions in @xmath9 at all time @xmath10 and introduce the flow map @xmath11 such that @xmath12 represents the arrival location @xmath13 of the particle trajectory satisfying the ode ( [ eqn : ode ] ) with the initial condition @xmath14 at the initial time @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that the mapping will take a point from @xmath16 at @xmath15 to another point @xmath13 at @xmath17 .    the finite time lyapunov exponent ( ftle ) @xcite measures the rate of separation between adjacent particles over a finite time interval with an infinitesimal perturbation in the initial location .",
    "mathematically , consider the initial time to be 0 and the final time to be @xmath18 , we have the change in the initial infinitesimal perturbation given by @xmath19 the leading order term of the magnitude of this perturbation is given by @xmath20^ * \\nabla \\phi_0^t(\\mathbf{x } ) \\delta",

    "is defined as @xmath25 } = \\frac{1}{|t| } \\ln \\sqrt{\\lambda_0^t({\\mathbf{x } } ) } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : ftle}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 denotes the largest eigenvalue of the cauchy - green tensor .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath18 in the expression reflects the fact that we can trace the particles either _ forward _ or _ backward _ in time . in the case when @xmath27 , we are measuring the maximum stretch _",
    "backward _ in time and this corresponds to the maximum compression _ forward _ in time . to distinguish different measures , we call @xmath24 the _ forward _ ftle if @xmath28 and the _ backward _ ftle if @xmath27 .",
    "a related concept is a widely used concept in oceanography called the finite size lyapunov exponent ( fsle ) which tries to measure the time it takes to separate two adjacent particles up to certain distance @xcite .",
    "there are two length scales in the original definition of the fsle .",
    "one is the initial distance between two particles which is denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "the other one is the so - called separation factor , denoted by @xmath30 . for any trajectory with initial location @xmath31 with @xmath32 ,",
    "we first determine the shortest time @xmath33 so that @xmath34 the fsle at the point @xmath35 is then defined as @xmath36    numerically , on the other hand , the maximization over the constraint @xmath32 might require special considerations and the corresponding optimization problem might not be easily solved by typical optimization algorithms .",
    "one simple approximation is to consider only @xmath37-neighbors of @xmath35 with each point @xmath38 obtained by perturbing one coordinate of @xmath35 with distance @xmath29 .    to avoid introducing two separate length scales ( @xmath29 and @xmath0 ) and the approximation by @xmath37 neighbors in the final optimization step , one theoretically takes the limit as the length scale @xmath29 tends to 0 .",
    "the fsle can then be reduced to the infinitesimal size lyapunov exponent ( isle ) as defined in @xcite given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the shortest time for which @xmath41 .",
    "even with tremendous theoretical development , there are not many discussions on the numerical implementations . because the quantity is defined using lagrangian particle trajectories , most numerical algorithms for computing the ftle or the fsle are developed based on the ray tracing method which tries to solve the flow system ( [ eqn : ode ] ) using a numerical integrator . in the two dimensional case , for example",
    ", the flow map is first determined by solving the ode system with the initial condition imposed on a uniform mesh @xmath42",
    ". then one can apply simple finite difference to determine the deformation tensor and , therefore , its eigenvalues .",
    "the computation of the ftle is a little easier . for a given final time ,",
    "one simply solves the ode system up to that particular time level .",
    "then the ftle at each grid location can be computed directly from these eigenvalues .",
    "the isle , on the other hand , is a little more involved since for a particular separation factor , @xmath0 , one has to continuously monitor the change in these eigenvalues and record the precise moment when it reaches the thresholding value .",
    "computational complexity could be one major concern of these numerical tools .",
    "let @xmath43 and @xmath44 be the number of grid points in each physical direction and in the temporal direction , respectively .",
    "the total number of operations required to compute the flow map @xmath45 is , therefore , @xmath46 .",
    "note however that such complexity is needed for determining the ftle or the isle on one single time level . for all time levels ,",
    "the computational complexity for these usual lagrangian implementation is @xmath47 .",
    "there are several nice ideas to improve the computational time .",
    "one natural idea is to concentrate the computations near the locations where the solutions have large derivatives by implementing an adaptive mesh strategy @xcite .",
    "another interesting approach is to avoid the computation of the overall map @xmath48 but to numerically decompose it into sub - maps @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "then , the extra effort from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , given by @xmath52 are simply some interpolations .",
    "all these proposed improvements are only on the flow map computations , and therefore the ftle . for the fsle or",
    "the isle computations on one single time level and one particular @xmath0 , say @xmath53 , one has to go through all @xmath54 mesh points in the temporal direction . for a different time level or even a different separation factor @xmath0",
