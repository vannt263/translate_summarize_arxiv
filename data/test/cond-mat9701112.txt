    "various approaches have been used to understand ageing experiments @xcite @xcite @xcite : droplet picture @xcite , mean field model @xcite @xcite , and trap models @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "ageing is by definition the property that the two points correlation function @xmath1 depends explicitly on the waiting time @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 is a macroscopic observable , for instance the magnetization in the zero field cooled experiment @xcite or the thermoremanent magnetization experiment @xcite . on the theoretical level",
    ", dynamics can be implemented in several ways .",
    "one possibility is langevin dynamics which was used for instance in @xcite where mean field ageing was first obtained , or in @xcite where ageing in the presence of flat directions was studied .",
    "another possibility is glauber dynamics @xcite . within the framework of glauber dynamics and",
    "given the probability distribution @xmath4 , for the system to be in any microcanonical state @xmath5 at time @xmath6 , the probability distribution at time @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the glauber matrix . by `` microcanonical states '' , we mean a state such as the system is in a given microcanonical configuration with probability one .",
    "this article is devoted to the study of the glauber dynamics of various models , phenomenological or microscopic , in connection with ageing .",
    "more precisely , for a finite size system of size @xmath10 , we calculate from the glauber matrix a time @xmath0 such as the finite size system equilibrates on a time of the order of @xmath0 , starting from out  of  equilibrium initial conditions at time @xmath6 . in terms of ageing , the correlation function ( [ eqcorr ] ) depends explicitely on the waiting time @xmath2 provided the system is out  of  equilibrium at time @xmath2 , namely @xmath2 is smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , ageing for a finite size system is interupted after @xmath0 [ see @xcite where the denomination `` interrupted ageing '' was proposed ] . in order to understand ageing in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath11 )",
    ", the variations of @xmath0 with the system size have to be carefully studied .",
    "if @xmath0 goes to a constant in the thermodynamic limit , ageing is interrupted , whereas if @xmath0 diverges ageing is not interrupted in the thermodynamic limit : in the thermodynamic limit , the system reaches equilibrium on infinite time scales .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of metastability without ageing on experimental time scales , as it is the case for instance in diamond .    in general",
    ", @xmath0 depends on the eigenvalues of the glauber matrix , but also on the overlaps between microcanonical states , and the transformation matrix elements between the eigenstates of the glauber matrix and the microcanonical states .",
    "however , in some simple cases , with only self  overlaping states , the time @xmath0 can be expressed only in terms of the density of eigenvalues of the glauber matrix .",
    "the form of the glauber matrix will be given in each case in the core of the paper .",
    "whatever the system , the eigenvalues of @xmath9 are negative .",
    "the spectrum is bounded above by zero ( zero is always an eigenvalue , corresponding to the equilibrium boltzmann distribution ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the glauber matrix have the dimension of the inverse of a time , so that they can be viewed as the inverse relaxation times of the system . since we are interested in long time behavior , a special attention will be paid to the smallest eigenvalues .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ gm ] , we present a detailed study of the average density of small eigenvalues of the random energy model ( rem ) like trap model proposed and studied in @xcite and inspired by the rem model @xcite .    in the case of the rem",
    " like trap model , two regimes are predicted and checked numerically for the density of small eigenvalues in the glass phase : an arrhenius  like regime and a non arrhenius regime for the smallest eigenvalues . by arrhenius  like regime , we mean a regime in which the density of eigenvalues is the same as the density of eigenvalues calculated from the arrhenius law , assuming a correspondence between the eigenvalues of the glauber matrix and the inverse relaxation times of the system .",
    "the eigenvalue density in the arrhenius regime are given in section [ arrh - def ] .",
    "we also establish a connection between the behavior of the density of small eigenvalues of rem  like trap models and the spectral dimension of the associated diffusion process .    next ,",
    "in section [ general ] , we give a general relation for the existence of ageing from a glauber dynamics point of view .",
    "this section is the main part of the present article . when applied to the rem  like trap model , our criterium is equivalent to the fact noticed in @xcite that the average trapping time diverges below @xmath12 .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to examine the case of other models : brownian motion which was shown in @xcite to be an ageing phenomenon , a model introduced by barrat and mzard @xcite ( bm model ) , the one dimensional ising chain ( in this case , our results are consistent with the existence of interrupted ageing ) , and the sherrington  kirkpatrick model ( sk model ) . in all these cases ,",
    "we find consistent results between the existence of ageing calculated from the behavior of the two times autocorrelation functions and our criterium based on the glauber matrix .",
    "we end  up with some final remarks .",
    "trap models can be defined without a priori reference to a microscopic model",
    ". however , some trap models , such as the rem  like trap model @xcite are related to the parisi solution of spin glasses : even though these models are toy models , some of them retain some feature of the dynamics of microscopic models .",
    "the rem  like trap model consists of a trap model in infinite dimension , that is , the system can `` hop '' from one trap to any other trap , according to the rules of the dynamics .",
    "other toplogies will be analyzed below , in reduced dimension .",
    "the rem  like trap model corresponds to a single replica symmetry breaking step .",
    "generalizations of the rem  like trap model including multi replica symmetry breaking steps were studied in @xcite and their relevance to explain experimental data was shown .",
    "the models of this section consist of @xmath10 traps of depth @xmath13 , with the @xmath14 chosen among the distribution @xmath15 .",
    "the reason why this particular energy trap distribution is chosen is that there exists a finite transition temperature between a high and a low temperature glassy phase @xcite .",
    "the dynamics rules are given by @xmath16 for @xmath17 if the traps @xmath18 and @xmath19 are connected and zero otherwise .",
    "the diagonal terms are defined by @xmath20 which enforces probability conservation .",
    "equation ( [ propcons ] ) is a general constraint for any glauber dynamics .",
    "another constraint is the detailed balance condition @xmath21 it is clear that the aforementioned rules for the dynamics of the rem  like trap model satisfy detailed balance .",
    "however , as we shall see below , other types of dynamics also satisfy detailed balance and probability conservation . as a consequence of detailed balance , the eigenvectors of the glauber matrix are not physical states ( in the sense that they are not probability distributions ) except for the boltzmann distribution ( the stationary eigenvector corresponding to the @xmath22 eigenvalue ) .",
    "notice that if @xmath9 is a glauber matrix @xmath23 , with @xmath24 a positive number , is also a glauber matrix .",
    "multiplying @xmath9 by @xmath24 amounts to changing the unit time .",
    "the proportionality constant is imposed by physical considerations .",
    "for the models considered in this section , this constant is chosen such as the diagonal elements of the glauber matrix do not scale with the number @xmath10 of traps in the large @xmath10 limit .",
    "for instance , in the infinite dimensional case , we choose @xmath25 .",
    "this dynamics will be studied with different phase space topologies : infinite dimension , where all the traps are connected ( section [ infinite ] ) , one dimensional topology , where a given trap is connected only to its two nearest neighbors ( section [ disor ] ) , and also one dimensional topology with `` ordered '' traps , in the sense that the trap energies have been ordered @xmath26 , and the trap at site @xmath18 has an energy @xmath14 .",
    "a useful property that we will use throughout this paper is that glauber matrices can be mapped onto symmetric matrices with the same spectrum .",
    "let us call @xmath27 the diagonal matrix @xmath28 .",
    "then , because of detailed balance , the matrix @xmath29 is symmetric and has the same spectrum as @xmath9 . using a quantum mechanical analogy ,",
    "we denote by @xmath30 the microcanonical state corresponding the system in trap @xmath18 with a probability unity .",
    "the analogy to quantum mechanics is useful , even though there is no hermitian structure .",
    "in particular , any linear combination of microcanonical states is not a probability distribution .",
    "we propose ourselves to carry out a detailed study of the density of eigenvalues of the rem  like trap model and related models in reduced dimension . since the arrhenius law is introduced `` by hand '' in the dynamics , it is interesting to question in which regime the density of eigenvalues is given by the arrhenius law , assuming a correspondence @xmath31 between the eigenvalues of the glauber matrix and relaxation times",
    ". we will naturally call _ arrhenius regime _ such a regime . as we will see below ,",
    "the density of eigenvalues is not always in the arrhenius regime .    in this arrhenius regime , and by definition , the off - diagonal terms are neglectable as far as the density of eigenvalues is concerned .",
    "the diagonal coefficients of the glauber matrix are proportional to @xmath32 , so that the distribution of eigenvalues is @xmath33 this distribution is the same as the one expected from an arrhenius law with life times @xmath34 .",
    "if one assumes an arrhenius picture , the distribution of relaxation times is @xmath35 which is equivalent to ( [ aha ] ) .",
    "as noticed in @xcite , the average trapping time diverges if @xmath36 , leading to ageing . distribution of trapping times with no first moment were already studied in @xcite , and shown to lead to anomalous diffusion , namely to a non trivial spectral dimension , even above the upper critical dimension .",
    "we will compare our results for the rem  like trap model with the results of @xcite derived of the context of anomalous diffusion on site ",
    "disordered hypercubic lattices .",
    "the density of eigenvalues is thus described by the arrhenius law provided the off - diagonal terms of the glauber matrix are a small perturbation , so that the density of eigenvalues of the glauber matrix is given by the diagonal terms only .",
    "we now examine several cases with different phase space topologies and determine in the different cases on which condition the density of eigenvalues is determined by the arrhenius picture .",
    "we also compare our analytical approach to numerical diagonalizations of the symmetrized matrix @xmath37 .      in this section ,",
    "the system can hop from one trap to any other trap ( infinite dimension ) .",
    "the diagonal coefficients are @xmath38 and the off  diagonal coefficients of the symmetrized glauber matrix are @xmath39      we treat the off ",
    "diagonal coefficients @xmath40 ( @xmath17 ) as a perturbation .",
    "this perturbative treatment is consistent since we are looking for a regime in which the off  diagonal coefficients",
    "do not modify the density of eigenvalues with respect to the purely diagonal case .",
    "the second order correction to the eigenvalue @xmath41 is @xmath42 the first order corrections being identically zero since the perturbation consists only of off  diagonal elements .",
    "we assume that the density of trap energies in the vicinity of @xmath14 is large enough for the discrete summation to be replaced by an integral .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied , the second order corrections @xmath43 may have large fluctuations because the divergence for @xmath44 is no more cancelled .",
    "the condition that the unperturbed eigenvalue density is large in the vicinity of @xmath14 simply reads @xmath45 .",
    "we assume in the rest of this section that this condition is fulfilled , and we can safely replace the discrete sum by an integral : @xmath46 the singularities for @xmath47 and @xmath48 cancel each other , and we can approximate @xmath43 as @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "we have used the following approximation : if @xmath51 is small , then @xmath52 and we use @xmath53 as a cut  off .",
    "clearly ( [ app ] ) is only an approximation , but we are only interested in the dominant behavior of @xmath54 as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "now , we want to compare the approximation ( [ app ] ) of @xmath43 to the typical level spacing between @xmath41 and @xmath55 , where we assume that the traps are ordered such as @xmath56 .",
    "to to so , we first calculate the distribution of @xmath57 and we obtain @xmath58 , with @xmath59 notice here that @xmath60 diverges as @xmath61 goes to zero if @xmath36 .",
    "this accumulation of small relaxation times is related to the existence a glass transition for this model for @xmath62 .",
    "let us now calculate the level spacing statistics @xmath63 , which is the density probability that the spacing between the absolute value of the eigenvalue @xmath9 and the absolute value of the next eigenvalue is @xmath64 .",
    "because of the statistical independence of the trap depths , @xmath63 is readily obtained as @xmath65 in this expression , @xmath66 is the number of levels in the interval @xmath67 $ ] ( with @xmath68 ) .",
    "the other terms correspond to the condition that there is no eigenvalue in the interval @xmath69 $ ] . assuming that @xmath61 is small compared to unity , and that @xmath10 is large , we get @xmath70 the off - diagonal terms are irrelevant to the density of eigenvalues provided @xmath71 is much smaller than unity .",
    "this condition reads @xmath72 , with @xmath73 defined in ( [ deltai ] ) . since we are looking for a necessary condition valid",
    "if @xmath36 , we neglect the temperature  dependent prefactor and conclude that the density of states is in the arrhenius regime only for traps such that @xmath74 .",
    "notice that the traps such as @xmath75 are deeper than the typical deepest trap ( of the order of @xmath76 ) .",
    "the arrhenius picture is thus valid for a _ typical _ trap realization , with a lowest trap not deeper than @xmath76 .",
    "however , non typical disorder realizations may be generated .",
    "for these realizations , the lowest eigenvalues are not described by an arrhenius picture .",
    "the existence or absence of the arrhenius regime even for a very large number of traps is thus sample dependent .",
    "this non self averaging behavior is reminiscent on the sample dependence of the quantity @xmath77 with @xmath78 the probability to find the system in trap @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the density of small eigenvalues of the rem  like trap model is pictured on figure [ fig1 ] . for practical purposes , we do not calculate the density @xmath79 since this quantity is too small for small eigenvalues ( see ( [ aha ] ) ) .",
    "we rather calculate @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the boltzmann weight associated to the eigenvalue @xmath82 , which is calculated as the average of the boltzmann weight operator @xmath83 over the eigenstate associated to the eigenvalue @xmath82 . in the arrhenius picture , we have @xmath84 since @xmath36 , @xmath85 increases exponentially as a function of @xmath86 when @xmath87 .",
    "we see on figure [ fig1 ] the existence of the arrhenius regime , in good agreement with the condition @xmath74 .",
    "we can now fit the density of eigenvalues in the arrhenius regime to the form @xmath88 and see if we recover @xmath89 , as predicted from the arrhenius law .",
    "the fit to the arrhenius law is shown on figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the variations of the exponent @xmath90 as a function of the inverse temperature are plotted on figure [ fig3 ] , and we conclude to a good agreement with the arrhenius law .",
    "random walks on a finite @xmath91dimensional lattice with a broad distribution of waiting times have been analyzed in the past ( see @xcite and references therein ) . as we shall see",
    ", we can relate our results concerning the existence of a arrhenius  like regime for the rem  like trap model to the results of @xcite , where the long time behavior of random walk on such lattices was investigated by means of the real space renormalization method introduced in @xcite .",
    "the rem  like trap model falls in the universality class described by machta since the ingredients are the same in the two cases , rather than the universality class of random walks in a random field force @xcite .",
    "in order to make contact with the work of machta , we first calculate the probability @xmath92 of being at the origin : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the probability to find the system in the trap @xmath18 at time @xmath7 , starting from the trap @xmath18 at time @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is the set of eigenvalues of the glauber matrix .",
    "we have shown that , in the infinite dimensional case , the typical small eigenvalue density ( relevant to the long time behavior of @xmath97 ) has the arrhenius form @xmath98 .",
    "a simple scaling analyzis then shows that @xmath99 in the long time limit .",
    "this result was derived for a graph such as any site is connected with any other site , that is we started from the begining from an infinite dimensional situation . in order to extrapolate this result to a finite dimension @xmath91 larger than the upper critical dimension 2 ( as shown in @xcite ) we first notice that , within the framework of the rem  like trap model , the microscopic time @xmath100 scales like @xmath101 , with @xmath102 the lattice spacing , whereas , in the context of random walks , the correct scaling is @xmath103 [ an illustration of the validity of such a scaling will be given in section [ brownian - motion ] ] .",
    "this implies that @xmath104 , which gives the correct prescription to go from the rem  like trap model in infinite dimension to the finite @xmath91 dimensional random walk model : one should replace the time @xmath7 in ( [ p0rem ] ) by @xmath105 .",
    "this leads to @xmath106 for @xmath91 larger than the upper critical dimension @xmath107 .",
    "this is exactly what was found in @xcite using a real space renormalization group approach , with a non trivial spectral dimension @xmath108 .",
    "we aim to calculate the structure of the eigenstates of the rem  like trap model .",
    "to do so , we decompose a given microcanonical state @xmath30 into the eigenvectors @xmath109 , and calculate the absolute value of the coefficients of this decomposition .",
    "the result is plotted on figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "we see that a microcanonical state @xmath30 with an eigenvalue @xmath110 is mainly a linear combination of eigenstates with eigenvalues close to @xmath110 .",
    "this observation can be understood in the framework of perturbation theory as follows .",
    "the first order correction to the eigenvectors are @xmath111 so that , at first order @xmath112 at the first order of perturbation theory , the pure states @xmath30 is thus mainly a linear combination of eigenvectors with an eigenvalue close to the eigenvalue of @xmath113 .    starting from a pure state @xmath30 at time @xmath6 , we can calculate the evolution of the system : @xmath114 \\nonumber , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used ( [ per1 ] ) and ( [ per2 ] ) .",
    "as expected from the arrhenius law , the relaxation time is of the order of @xmath115 , which diverges in the limit @xmath116 .",
    "we will compare below the structure of the eigenvectors of the rem  like trap model to the structure of eigenvectors of another model ( bm model ) .",
    "assuming periodic boundary conditions , the diagonal terms of the glauber matrix are given by @xmath117 the perturbation induced by the off - diagonal terms does not affect significatively the density of eigenvalues provided the perturbation @xmath118 is small compared to the level spacing between @xmath41 and @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath119 is uncorrelated from @xmath14 , the matrix element @xmath120 must be averaged over @xmath119 , so that @xmath40 is of the order of @xmath121 , that is @xmath122 the distribution of eigenvalues of the unperturbed system is @xmath123 from what we deduce the level spacing statistics in the long time ( small @xmath61 ) approximation @xmath124 the off - diagonal terms do not affect the density of eigenvalues provided @xmath125 which leads to the condition @xmath126 .",
    "the average number of traps generated among a sequence of @xmath10 independent traps chosen among the distribution @xmath127 and fulfilling the aforementioned condition is @xmath128 which is vanishing in the large @xmath10 limit . we thus conclude that the arrhenius regime with this topology does not exist , that is off - diagonal terms will always modify significatively the density of eigenvalues with respect to the arrhenius case .",
    "as we will see below , the arrhenius regime is replaced by a renormalized arrhenius regime , where the density of eigenvalues is given by ( [ lawarr ] ) , but with @xmath90 lower than @xmath129 .",
    "again , we generate numerically the density of small eigenvalues @xmath85 .",
    "the fit is shown on figure [ fig2 ] , and the variations of the exponent in the arrhenius regime are plotted on figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we conclude to the existence of a renormalized arrhenius regime , in the sense that the density of eigenvalues is given by ( [ lawarr ] ) but with an exponent @xmath90 smaller than @xmath129 , indicating a slowing down of the dynamics due to the one dimensional topology compared to the infinite dimensional case : in one dimension , to go from one trap to a deeper trap , the system has to jump to intermediate traps .",
    "section [ relation1 ] was devoted to the connection between the spectrum of the glauber matrix in infinite dimension and the long time behavior of random walks on finite @xmath91 dimensional trapped hypercubic lattices above the upper critical dimension .",
    "we now analyze the analogy in one dimension .",
    "we have shown numerically that the density of eigenvalues behaves like @xmath130 for small @xmath82 , where @xmath131 is different from @xmath9 . in terms of random walks , this result becomes , with the notations of section [ relation1 ] @xmath132 namely the spectral dimension is @xmath133 .",
    "we now use the results of @xcite where @xmath134 was calculated : @xmath135 from what we conclude that the coefficient @xmath90 plotted on figure [ fig3 ] is @xmath136 this analytic form is consistent with numerical calculations of the density of eigenvalues .",
    "we now assume that @xmath10 energy traps were generated among the distribution @xmath127 , and that these energies have been ordered in such a way that @xmath56 .",
    "a site @xmath66 with a trap of energy @xmath137 is connected to the sites @xmath138 ( with an energy @xmath139 ) and @xmath140 ( with an energy @xmath141 , except for the sites @xmath142 and @xmath10 which have no neighbor .",
    "intuitively , such a trap ordering should make the dynamics faster with respect to the case analyzed in section [ disor ] since the system can decrease its energy continuously during the relaxation .",
    "we have @xmath143 since the density of level spacings @xmath63 ( [ p(s ) ] ) is large for small values of @xmath61 , we expect that @xmath55 is close to @xmath41 at least if @xmath144 is small , so that we can use the following approximation : @xmath145 .",
    "the off - diagonal terms will not modify the density of eigenvalues with respect to the arrhenius case provided @xmath146 that is @xmath75 .",
    "the number of traps fulfilling this condition in a distribution of @xmath10 traps is on average equal to unity , so that only a small number of eigenvalues contribute to the arrhenius regime .",
    "nevertheless , it is still possible to make a statistics over a large ensemble of @xmath10 traps distribution and to test numerically if the arrhenius regime can be observed .",
    "we generated numerically the density of small eigenvalues @xmath85 .",
    "as shown on figure [ fig2 ] , we still can fit @xmath147 to the form @xmath148 , and the exponent @xmath90 is close to @xmath129 , as in the arrhenius regime .",
    "( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that ordering the traps in one dimension restores the arrhenius regime for the lowest eigenvalues .",
    "again , the existence of the arrhenius regime is sample dependent .",
    "we are now going to give a general relation between ageing and the glauber matrix .",
    "this relation is a generalization of a criterium given in @xcite . in the context of the rem ",
    "like trap model , the average trapping time @xmath149 diverges if @xmath150 . on the other hand , ageing exists below @xmath12 only , in the limit where the microscopic time scale @xmath100 goes to zero .",
    "we are now going to argue that a similar criterium can be found for any statistical mechanical model , provided the master equation is linear .",
    "this is not always the case .",
    "for instance , the master equation of the backgammon model in a mean field dynamics at zero temperature is not linear @xcite .",
    "let us now start our general argument .",
    "the idea is to start with a system in a given microcanonical state @xmath30 and write the glauber dynamics equation for the evolution of this pure state .",
    "first , we call @xmath151 the transformation matrix @xmath152 where @xmath30 is a microcanonical state and @xmath153 are the eigenstates of the glauber matrix . by microcanonical state , we mean that if the system is in the state @xmath30 , the system is with probability one in the microcanonical state @xmath5 . in order to avoid confusion ,",
    "all the labels related to the eigenvectors will be denoted by greek letters whereas the labels for pure states will be denoted by latin letters .",
    "the evolution of the pure state ( [ pure2 ] ) is readily obtained as @xmath154 in other words , the probability to be in microcanonical state @xmath155 at time @xmath7 starting from the microcanonical state @xmath5 is @xmath156 we now consider the time ",
    "dependent correlation function @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the number of microcanonical states .",
    "we use @xmath158 instead of @xmath10 to avoid confusion between the number of microstates @xmath158 and the number of sites @xmath10 in a spin model . in a trap model , @xmath159 , whereas in an ising spin system , @xmath160 . in ( [ correlation ] ) , we have carried out an average over all the initial microcanonical states , that is the system is first quenched from an infinite temperature , and the correlation ( [ correlation ] ) is averaged over the realizations of the infinite temperature states . in ( [ correlation ] ) , @xmath161 is the overlap between the pure states @xmath5 and @xmath155 , which has to be defined within each model . as we will see below in section",
    "[ brownian - motion ] , even within a given dynamics , the choice of the overlap depends on what type of observables are considered in the two times correlation functions .",
    "we now want to calculate from ( [ correlation ] ) a typical time by integrating ( [ correlation ] ) .",
    "however , the boltzmann eigenstate leads to a trivial divergence of this integral .",
    "we thus need a prescription to eliminate the equilibrium distribution in ( [ correlation ] ) .",
    "we first discuss this prescription in the absence of metastability and postpone for later discussion the case of metastability .",
    "we define the typical time @xmath162 by @xmath163 where the summation over the eigenstates excludes the boltzmann distribution .",
    "the overline denotes an average over the disorder realizations , if necessary .",
    "the significance of @xmath0 is clear : for a finite size system with @xmath10 sites , the out  of  equilibrium dynamics occurs before @xmath0 and , for times larger than @xmath0 , the finite size system has equilibriated . in other words",
    ", @xmath0 is the cross  over time before which the finite size system exhibits ageing .",
    "notice that in this argument , the system is a finite size system .",
    "one should thus carefully study finite size effects .",
    "two cases may occur : first , @xmath0 tends to a constant in the thermodynamic limit . in this case , ageing is interrupted @xcite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "as we shall see , this is the case for the ising chain at a finite temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 diverges in the thermodynamic limit , ageing is not interrupted . in this case , the exitence of a divergent relaxation time with respect to times @xmath95 and @xmath7 implies the existence of a divergent relaxation time with respect to any finite waiting time @xmath2 and @xmath164 , and thus the existence of ageing in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the relation between the existence / absence , the nature of ageing in the thermodynamic limit and the behavior of @xmath0 was derived on heuristic basis .",
    "we could not find a rigourous derivation using a general argument .",
    "however , in what follows , we investigate the behavior of several models ( rem  like trap model , random walks , bm model , one dimensional ising chain and sk model ) and we find in all these cases that our criterium based on the behavior of @xmath0 is correct .",
    "as far as non interrupted ageing in the thermodynamic limit is concerned , we will see below that this is the case for the bm and sk models .",
    "this is also the case for the rem  like trap model .",
    "we have shown in section [ infinite ] that for all the typical realizations of the trap configurations ( typical is defined in section [ infinite ] ) , the density of eigenvalues is given by the arrhenius law , which means that , in the case of the rem  like trap model , our criterium for the existence of ageing is equivalent to the criterium of bouchaud @xcite that we have recalled at the beginning of this section , provided the overlap between traps is taken to be @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the edwards  anderson order parameter ( within the one replica symmetry breaking step picture ) .",

    "let us now discuss the behavior of the correlation function ( [ correlation ] ) in the presence of metastability .",
    "we have in mind the case of diamond for instance , which is metastable but in which case there is no ageing .",
    "we do not have a glauber matrix description of diamond , but take this case as a generic situation for metastability and draw qualitative conclusions . in this case",
    "we expect that for a finite size system , ( [ correlation ] ) will first decay to a finite value over a first time scale @xmath175 .",
    "after @xmath175 , the system reaches its metastable configuration ( for instance diamond ) and thermalizes in a portion of its phase space .",
    "we thus expect that , for times larger than @xmath175 , the correlation ( [ correlation ] ) reaches a plateau . on larger time scales , the correlation ( [ correlation ] ) should decay to its equilibrium value with a cross  over time @xmath176 , corresponding for instance to the transition from diamond to graphite .",
    "the time scale @xmath176 should increase with the number of sites , so that , with a macroscopic number of sites , no transition from diamond to graphite is observable on experimental time scales . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath175 may remain small even in the thermodynamic limit , signaling the absence of ageing in the graphite phase .",
    "in such a situation where the cross  over time scale @xmath176 is not observable , the only relevant time scale is @xmath175 . in order to calculate @xmath175 one should not use the prescription ( [ prescription ] ) but rather substract to the correlation ( [ correlation ] ) its plateau value for @xmath177 .",
    "brownian motion was shown in @xcite to be an ageing phenomenon .",
    "this model is simple and thus provides a simple test of the criterium of section [ general ] .",
    "brownian motion in an euclidian space of dimension @xmath91 has the following glauber dynamics : @xmath178 and @xmath179 if @xmath18 and @xmath19 are nearest neighbors on a hypercubic lattice .",

    ", the glauber matrix is symmetric and , because of translational invariance , its eigenstates are plane waves @xmath180 where @xmath181 ( we have assumed cyclic boundary conditions with a lattice spacing @xmath102 ) .",
    "the matrix elements of the glauber matrix on the plane wave basis are @xmath182 where @xmath90 runs over the @xmath91 directions and @xmath183 is the component of the wave vector @xmath184 on the @xmath90 direction . the long time behavior of the random walk is readily obtained by expanding the cosine up to the second order , and the probability to find the brownian particle at time @xmath2 on site @xmath185 is , in the long time limit : @xmath186 where the particle is at the origin at time @xmath6 ( out of equilibrium state ) . as noticed first in @xcite , the two times correlation functions of the position are proportional to the waiting time : @xmath187 in the large @xmath2 limit . in order to make contact with @xcite , one should adopt the scaling @xmath188 in the thermodynamic / long time limits , which allows to recover the langevin dynamics results and thus the existence of ageing in any dimension for the position  position correlation function .    in order to make contact between the correlation ( [ c(1 ) ] ) and the general form of the correlation ( [ correlation ] ) , we should choose the overlap @xmath189 . with this choice of the overlap , ( [ correlation ] ) and ( [ c(1 ) ] )",
    "are both related to the same physical quantity : the mean square displacement . using this specific form for the overlap",
    ", one can calculate @xmath190 , integrate with respect to @xmath7 and show that @xmath191 , in agreement with the existence of ageing in this system for the position correlations .",
    "one could also be interested in the following correlation : @xmath192 in the large @xmath7 , @xmath2 limit , this correlation is found to be @xmath193 in the thernodynamic limit , @xmath194 , @xmath188 , so that @xmath195 is vanishing in the thermodynamic limit , signaling the absence of ageing for the correlation ( [ c(2 ) ] ) .",
    "the overlap associated to the correlation ( [ c(2 ) ] ) is the local one : @xmath196 .",
    "we can thus calculate @xmath197 using the integration ( [ taurem ] ) over the density of eigenvalues . in order to calculate the behavior of @xmath0",

    "the number @xmath10 of sites is @xmath199 . by thermodynamic limit , we mean that @xmath200 is fixed , @xmath194 and @xmath188 . using ( [ taurem ] )",
    ", we have then @xmath201 where the summation is restricted over the wave vectors @xmath184 such as @xmath202 .",
    "clearly , the dominant contribution to ( [ tau(2 ) ] ) comes from the smallest eigenvalues only .",
    "it is thus legitimate to expand the eigenvalues up to the quadratic order in @xmath184 : @xmath203 one then obtains @xmath204 if @xmath205 , @xmath206 since @xmath188 , @xmath207 in the thermodynamic limit in two dimensions .",
    "now if @xmath208 , @xmath209 since @xmath188 , this expression goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit whatever the dimension .",
    "we have thus shown that , in the case of random walks , and in the case of the correlations ( [ c(1 ) ] ) and ( [ c(2 ) ] ) , the existence / absence of ageing in the thermodynamic limit is consistent with the general argument of section [ general ] .",
    "we assume that the traps have been ordered such as @xmath56 . unlike the rem  like trap model",

    ". the spectrum is @xmath216 .",
    "the eigenvector @xmath217 for the eigenvalue @xmath22 is @xmath218 .",
    "it is easy to show that the eigenvector @xmath219 associated to the eigenvalue @xmath220 is @xmath221 we can now express the pure states in terms of eigenvectors @xmath222 this means that , at zero temperature , a pure state @xmath223 [ @xmath66 is the @xmath66-ieth traps , with @xmath26 ] overlaps only with eigenstates associated to eigenvalues @xmath225 , and this overlap does not depend on the eigenstate .",
    "compared to the result of section [ eigi ] , the structure of the decomposition of a pure state into eigenstates of the glauber dynamics is very different from the rem  like trap model .",
    "if one starts from a pure state @xmath226 at time @xmath6 , the state of the system at time @xmath7 is given by @xmath227 we recover the fact that this model can reach its ground state in a time of order @xmath10 at zero temperature , whereas in the limit of zero temperatures , and for the rem  like trap model , the time spent in a trap @xmath18 is proportional to @xmath228 , which goes to infinity if @xmath229 and @xmath10 fixed .",
    "the two times autocorrelation functions were calculated in @xcite by means of a laplace transform formalism .",
    "the result is @xmath230 if @xmath231 .",
    "we rederive this result in the appendix using a treatment different from @xcite , and based only on the diagonalization of the glauber matrix .",
    "the bm dynamics thus exhibits ageing .",
    "provided only self overlaps are non zero ( @xmath232 ) , the correlation function introduced in section [ general ] is @xmath233 , provided @xmath234 .",
    "the typical time @xmath235 below which ageing occurs is thus logarithmically divergent . on the other hand , this can be also shown directly from the spectrum : @xmath236 which diverges logarithmically .",
    "as far as the finite temperature behavior of the two times autocorrelation function is concerned , this model exhibits interrupted ageing @xcite since at any finite temperature the correlation length is finite , of the order of @xmath237 , ageing does not exist after a time independent of the system size .",
    "it is thus interesting to apply to this case the general argument of section [ general ] .",
    "we first begin with the definition of the glauber dynamics .",
    "we use the dynamics introduced in @xcite .",
    "the master equation of this single spin flip dynamics is @xmath238 as a consequence of detailed balance , @xmath239 notice that , unlike the case of the rem  like trap or bm models , there is no need to multiply the matrix elements by @xmath240 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that in the infinite temperature limit , the eigenvalues of the glauber matrix are negative integers between @xmath241 and @xmath95 , with degeneracies given by the binomial coefficients .",
    "the largest relaxation time in the infinite temperature limit is equal to unity whatever the system size , and there is thus no need to rescale the coefficients of the glauber matrix .      in the case of a spin model ,",
    "the overlap @xmath242 is given by @xmath243 since ageing is interrupted , we should observe a saturation of the time @xmath244 as @xmath10 increases .",
    "moreover , @xmath244 should increase as the temperature decreases . in practise",
    ", we work with an open chain and we take advantage of the existence of the global @xmath245 symmetry ( invariance of the glauber dynamics under the @xmath246 transformation in a zero magnetic field ) , and the reflection symmetry of the chain .",
    "the glauber matrix is diagonalized in each of these four symmetry sectors .",
    "the results are plotted on figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the difference @xmath247 decreases as @xmath10 increases , in agreement with the existence of interrupted ageing .",
    "this model was proposed in 1975 as an `` exactly solvable '' model of spin glasses @xcite . for reviews on this model and its developments ,",
    "we refer the reader to the reviews @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the sk model is @xmath248 where the sum is carried out over all the pairs of sites ( infinite dimensional model ) and the quenched random interactions are distributed according to a gaussian distribution @xmath249 this model is a spin glass if @xmath250 and a paramagnet otherwise .",
    "the two times correlation function were shown in @xcite to exhibit ageing in the glassy phase .",
    "we are going to apply our general argument of section [ general ] to the case of the rem  like trap model .",
    "to do so , we calculate numerically @xmath251 for a large number of disorder realizations .",
    "the result is plotted on figure [ fig6 ] , as well as the differences @xmath252 for @xmath253 sites .",
    "we observe that @xmath254 increases at low temperatures and decreases at high temperature .",
    "the crossing point on the insert of figure [ fig6 ] should be identified to the glass temperature .",
    "this temperature is not equal to unity since the system sizes are very small .",
    "notice that even though the sizes are quite small , a large number of disorder configurations is required to have a significant statistics ( of the order of 500000 independent disorder configurations ) .",
    "the computer time required was equivalent to 1000 hours of cpu time on a single processor .",
    "our results are thus consistent with the existence of ageing in the low temperature phase , and no ageing in the high temperature phase .",
    "we have thus carried out a detailed analysis of ageing from a glauber dynamics point of view , with an emphasis on finite size effects .",
    "we have shown how to extract information from the glauber matrix about ageing , and how to analyze finite size effects . in some simple cases with only self overlaps , the behavior of the time after which there is no ageing only involves the knowledge of the average density of eigenvalues @xmath173 when @xmath87 .",
    "this is the case for the rem  like trap model , in which case we have carried out a careful analysis of the density of small eigenvalues .",
    "our analysis was confirmed by numerical diagonalizations of glauber matrices of small clusters . in this case",
    ", we were able to related the typical behavior of the density of eigenvalues to the spectral dimension of the corresponding diffusion process .    :",
