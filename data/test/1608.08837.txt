    "we find at least one source per field and we measure a shift between 0.1@xmath28 and 0.6@xmath28 in random directions between the hst ( or hawk - i ) counterpart and the alma detection . given the depth of the candels images ( @xmath31 at 5@xmath32 ) it is unlikely that the alma detections are associated to other objects undetected in the h - band .",

    "for uds16291 and nttdf6345 the [ cii ] detections are centered at the position of the near - ir sources , and for cosmos13679 the offset ( 0.4@xmath29 ) is within the range of those reported in the literature and measured for the serendipitous sources : for these three galaxies we conclude that the [ cii ] emission comes from the same region as the bulk of the sf observed in the near - ir images . for cosmos24108",
    "the offset is slightly larger than the range reported in the literature , and while the [ cii ] emission is almost certainly associated to the source , it could actually come from an external region of the galaxy , not coincident with the bulk of the star formation .",
    "a similar case was already observed in bdf3299 at z=7.109 ( maiolino et al .",
    "2015 ) : for this galaxy we concluded that the [ cii ] emission arises from an external accreting / satellite clump of neutral gas , in agreement with recent models of galaxy formation ( vallini et al .",
    "while the identification with another transition from a foreground galaxy , which by chance happens to be at 0.8@xmath28 from cosmos24108 , is unlikely , we can not completely discard the possibility of a spurious detection given the low s / n .",

    "the small shifts in our galaxies are particularly significant given that in general objects with low ly@xmath1 emission have larger velocity offsets . a similar tentative evidence for smaller ly@xmath1 velocities at @xmath19 compared to @xmath3 was recently reported by stark et al .",
    "( 2015 ) using the uv nebular ciii]@xmath36 doublet to determine the systemic redshift in two distant lbgs .",
    "the velocity of ly@xmath1 compared to the systemic redshift is very relevant when interpreting the line visibility during the reionization epoch , in the presence of a partly neutral igm @xcite .",
    "smaller velocity offsets imply that ly@xmath1 is closer to resonance and more easily quenched by a neutral igm .",
    "if at redshift 6 and 7 the offsets are as large as those found for lower redshift lbgs , the igm must be very neutral to produce the drop in ly@xmath1 fraction that is observed between these two epochs @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the velocity offsets were much smaller , as our observations indicate , the drop in the ly@xmath1 visibility could be produced by an igm that is still substantially more ionized @xcite .      in figure 3",
    "we show the sfr - l[cii ] relation for our galaxies and previously observed sources .",
    "we plot cosmos24108 with a different symbol because it is not certain whether its [ cii ] emission is from the main galaxy or just from a clump in its outskirt , in which case the point would shift @xmath37 to the left .",
    "we remark that the sfr for our sources as well as previous @xmath12 ones are uv - based , with no correction for dust extinction .",

    "sample we plot sed - derived sfr .",
    "our galaxies are a factor of 2 - 3 less luminous in l[cii ] than @xmath45.5 galaxies with similar sfrs .",
    "they also fall below the sfr - l[cii ] relation of low redshift star forming galaxies and low metallicity galaxies ( black solid and dashed lines @xcite ) . + previous observations of @xmath19 galaxies failed to detect the [ cii ] emission .",
    "some of the galaxies were fainter than ours , but few others were in the same range and in these cases the limits reached were deep enough to detect [ cii ] if the emission was at the same level as in our sources ( maiolino et al .",
    "2015 , schaerer et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "however we note that previously observed sources were either selected as ly@xmath1 emitters or were lbgs but their spectra showed a ly@xmath1 emission with very high ew ( typically @xmath2440  ) .",
    "the only exception z8-gnd-5296 at z=7.5 which has modest ly@xmath1 emission , but in this case the l[cii ] limit is very shallow @xcite .",
    "our four new sources have ly@xmath1 emission with low ew ( table 1 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath1 emission strength is known to depend on the presence on dust and possibly metallicity @xcite : although the derivation of metallicity is not easy , several studies indicate that laes are more metal poor galaxies compared to the rest of the lbg population ( e.g. song et al .",
    "metallicity plays an important role in shaping the sfr - l[cii ] relation : in figure 3 we show different metallicity dependent relations produced by a recent study of vallini et al .",
    "( 2015 ) based on high - resolution , radiative transfer cosmological simulations .",
    "the different lines have z=0.05,0.1 and 0.2 @xmath38 respectively , and for metallicity @xmath39 are consistently below the relation found for local galaxies .",
    "therefore the contradictory results for @xmath40 galaxies might be due to different intrinsic metallicity .    alternatively galaxies could be caught in different evolutionary stages : it has been suggested that molecular clouds in the central parts of primordial galaxies could be rapidly disrupted by stellar feedback hence suppressing the emission of [ cii ] .",
    "clumps of neutral gas ( or small satellites ) in the outer regions of such galaxies , could survive photo - ionization and still show [ cii ] emission , as a consequence of the diffuse far - uv radiation emitted by the primary galaxy .",
    "this could be the case of cosmos24108 , where the [ cii ] emission is offset from the near - ir source , and could come from one such clump .",
    "a similar occurrence was also observed in bdf3299 at z=7.109 where the [ cii ] emission was displaced by the near - ir source by 4 kpc .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an extensive discussion of this scenario .      assuming the sources have ordered motions",
    ", we can estimate the dynamical masses based on the [ cii ] velocity dispersion .",
    "we follow the method described in wang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) who approximate @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the circular velocity in km s@xmath2 , d is the size in kpc , @xmath43/sin(i)$ ] , and @xmath44 , the disk inclination angle .",
    "our sources are only marginally resolved so we assume an upper limit on d from the resolution of 0.9@xmath28 .",
    "we obtain masses between @xmath45 .",
    "we can compare these values to the total stellar masses determined by a classical sed fitting of the multi - wavelength photometry for the 3 candels sources .",
    "we use the photometry from the candels catalogs , including deep irac data essential for sampling the rest - frame optical emission at these redshifts .",
    "we include the contribution from nebular emission lines , which can strongly contaminate the irac bands .",
    "the stellar masses are reported in table 1 and are very similar to the dynamical masses , especially considering the uncertainty due to the unknown inclination angle @xmath44 .",
    "we have presented alma [ cii ] emission line detections in four @xmath19 galaxies .",
    "our observations demonstrate that it is possible to detect [ cii ] during the reionization epoch and that the line luminosity is @xmath46 times lower than expected on the basis of the lower redshift relations .",
    "we find evidence for reduced velocity offsets of the ly@xmath1 emission compared to @xmath47 lbgs : if confirmed this could have important implications for reionization models , since small shifts alleviate the need for a very neutral igm to reproduce the observed decline of ly@xmath1 emission at @xmath18 .",
    "these results can help us tune future alma observations of high - z lbgs where no ly@xmath1 emission is visible but where precise photometric redshifts exist , as in the candels fields .",
    "given that in the reionization epoch most galaxies do not show ly@xmath1 emission , this means that [ cii ] can be an efficient alternative to derive the redshift for the majority of the galaxy population . while larger samples of targets with different luminosities and ly@xmath1 properties are needed to put our conclusions on firmer grounds , additional diagnostic can be used to interpret the physical conditions in these objects .",
    "for example in case of photo - ionization feedback [ nii ] at 205@xmath16 m can be much stronger than [ cii ] ( pavesi et al .",
    "alternatively the [ oii ] line at 88m@xmath16 could be brighter than [ cii ] in chemically unevolved systems ( cormier et al . 2015 ) as recently observed in a dust - poor galaxy at z=7.2 ( inoue et al .",
