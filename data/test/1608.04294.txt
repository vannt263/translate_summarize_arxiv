    "this implementation of dice2013r makes use of the casadi framework for algorithmic differentiation and numeric optimization @xcite in conjunction with matlab .",
    "version 3.0.0 of casadi is used and , hence , matlab 2014a or later is generally required .",
    "appropriate binaries of casadi v.3.0.0 are available at @xcite .",
    "similar to casadi , dice2013r - mc is distributed under the gnu lesser general public license ( lgpl ) , and hence the code can be used royalty - free even in commercial applications .",
    "the dice2013r model operates on five year time steps beginning from 2010 . to formalize this ,",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 be the discrete time index .",
    "then @xmath3 yields @xmath4 as desired .    the dice2013r model has six endogenous state variables : two variables to model the global climate in the form of atmospheric and oceanic temperatures ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , in units of @xmath7c ) , three variables to model the global carbon cycle in the form of carbon concentrations in the atmosphere , upper ocean , and lower ocean ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , respectively , in units of gtc ) , and one state for global capital ( @xmath11 , in units of trillions 2005usd ) .",
    "decision variables or control inputs are the emissions mitigation rate ( @xmath12 ) and the savings rate ( @xmath13 ) where the latter is the ratio of investment to net economic output .",
    "finally , the model is also driven by several exogenous , time - varying terms such as population and total factor productivity .",
