    "a milestone in extrasolar planet research was reached when charbonneau et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and henry et al .",
    "( 2000 ) observed the photometric signal of transits by the low - mass companion of hd  209458 .",
    "the companion was originally discovered by radial velocity measurements ( mazeh et al .",
    "2000 ) , which specified only the orbital period ( 3.5 days ) , orbital eccentricity ( @xmath7 ) , and minimum mass of the companion ( @xmath8  @xmath9 ) .",
    "the transit light curves allowed the measurement of the companion s mass ( by breaking the @xmath10 degeneracy ) and radius ( from the depth of the transit ) , providing an unambiguous case of a planetary - mass companion to a main sequence star , and a demonstration that the companion s density was that of a gas giant planet .    aside from this historic importance ,",
    "the discovery made possible a number of unique and important follow - up studies , based on more subtle changes in the received starlight that should occur during transits . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with changes due to the passage of a small fraction of the starlight through the planetary atmosphere .",
    "selective absorption by atmospheric constituents causes the transit depth to depend upon wavelength , an effect that forms the basis of `` transmission spectroscopy . ''",
    "upper limits on various atmospheric absorption features have been given by bundy and marcy ( 2000 ) , moutou et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , brown , libbrecht , and charbonneau ( 2002 ) , and moutou et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . the first successful detection using this technique was by charbonneau et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who observed a @xmath11% increase in transit depth in the yellow light of the sodium resonance doublet .",
    "a strong sodium signal had been predicted by seager and sasselov ( 2000 ) , and subsequently by brown ( 2001 ) and hubbard et al.(2001 ) .",
    "more recently , vidal - madjar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported a remarkably large transit depth of @xmath12% in the ultraviolet light of the lyman-@xmath0 ( ly@xmath0 ) transition of neutral hydrogen .",
    "to produce such a large absorption , a spherical cloud of neutral hydrogen would need a radius of @xmath13 or greater ( depending on the optical depth ) , as compared to the planetary radius of @xmath14 inferred from broad - band observations , and the roche lobe radius of @xmath15 .",
    "such a signal could be produced by an extended envelope of hydrogen atoms that are evaporating from the planet s upper atmosphere .",
    "vidal - madjar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) noted that the apparent blueshift of the absorbing atoms ( up to @xmath16  km  s@xmath17 ) provided additional evidence for atmospheric escape , and speculated that this evaporation process accounts for the rarity of extrasolar planets with orbital periods smaller than 3 days .",
    "additional data obtained by vidal - madjar et al .",
    "( 2004 ) were consistent with the previous ly@xmath0 result , and provided evidence ( at the 23@xmath18 level ) for exospheric absorption by oxygen ( o  i ) and carbon ( c  ii ) .",
    "further confirmation of the existence of this `` exosphere , '' and characterization of its temperature , density , and composition are clearly important goals .",
    "unfortunately , theoretical predictions for the properties of the exosphere are not robust , making it difficult to design strategies for observing the exosphere .",
    "one approach is to search for additional effects of hydrogen , which has already been implicated by the ly@xmath0 measurement .",
    "if a significant fraction of the hydrogen exists in the first excited state ( @xmath2 ) , it will produce extra absorption in the balmer lines of the stellar spectrum , and in particular h@xmath0 ( 6563   ) .",
    "thus we were motivated to search for h@xmath0 absorption from the exosphere of hd  209458b .",
    "a positive detection would confirm the existence of the hydrogen exosphere and constrain its density and temperature , with implications for the long - term evolution of `` hot jupiter '' extrasolar planets .",
    "it would also represent a new and more practical means of searching for exospheres of other extrasolar planets , given the necessity of observing ly@xmath0 absorption above the earth s atmosphere , and the confusing effects of ly@xmath0 absorption by interstellar hydrogen and emission from the geocorona .",
    "previously , bundy and marcy ( 2000 ) placed upper limits of 34% on h@xmath19 and h@xmath20 absorption in a 0.3    band , although they did not examine h@xmath0 due to contamination of that region of the spectrum by i@xmath21 lines .",
    "moutou et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also searched for exospheric absorption in optical spectra .",
    "they did not remark on h@xmath0 in particular , but set upper limits of @xmath221% for any features of width 0.2   , and noted that the limits could be improved significantly with higher quality spectra taken in better atmospheric conditions .",
    "we have been obtaining optical echelle spectra of hd  209458 with the subaru telescope , over a wide range of planetary orbital phases , in order to search for reflected light from the planet .",
    "data taken on the night of a planetary transit , described in section 2 , are well - suited for the h@xmath0 search .",
    "the procedure by which we compared the spectra taken at different times is given in section 3 , and significantly improved upper limits on exospheric h@xmath0 absorption are derived from the data . in section 4",
    "we discuss the physical interpretation and provide a brief summary .",
    "we observed hd  209458 on ut  2002  october  25 with the subaru 8.2  m telescope of the national astronomical observatory of japan , on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the planet was predicted to transit its parent star in the middle of that night , according to the ephemeris of brown et al.(2001 ) .",
    "we used the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ; noguchi et al.2002 ) mounted at the @xmath23 optical nasmyth focus .",
    "the entrance slit was @xmath24 long and @xmath25 wide , oriented at a constant position angle .",
    "we used the standard yb setup , in which the beam passes through an order - blocking kv370 filter , is collimated by the red - optimized mirror , dispersed by the echelle grating ( 31.6  grooves  mm@xmath17 , blaze angle @xmath26 ) , cross - dispersed by the red - optimized grating ( 250  grooves  mm@xmath17 , blaze angle @xmath27 ) , and detected on two ccds , each having @xmath28 pixels of size 13.5  @xmath29 m .",
    "the wavelength coverage was 4100    @xmath30  6800    with resolution @xmath31 .",
    "we obtained 29 spectra of hd  209458 , each with an exposure time of 500  seconds , through air masses ranging from 1.0 to 1.9 .",
    "additionally , at both the start and end of this series of exposures , we obtained a spectrum with an i@xmath21 cell behind the slit ( and a narrower slit width of @xmath32 ) in order to determine accurate radial velocities for the star and verify the ephemeris . at the end of the night",
    ", we obtained 7 spectra of the b5  vn star hd  42545 in order to estimate the telluric spectrum : any narrow absorption features in the spectrum of this rapidly rotating star ( @xmath33  km  s@xmath17 ; abt et al .",
    "2002 ) are almost certainly telluric .",
    "the weather conditions were excellent , and the seeing was approximately @xmath34 .",
    "we used standard iraf procedures to process the frames and extract one - dimensional spectra .",
    "the frames were debiased , trimmed , and multiplied by the gain .",
    "a median flat field was created from 20 dome - lamp exposures and normalized in two dimensions ( along the dispersion , to take out the lamp spectrum , and perpendicular to the dispersion , to take out the aperture profile ) , and then used to correct for pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations .",
    "a two - dimensional smooth polynomial surface was fitted to the inter - order scattered light in each frame , and subtracted .",
    "the wavelength solution was determined from thorium - argon arc exposures taken at the start and end of each night .",
    "a total of 54 orders were extracted , after fitting the trace of each order of each spectrum separately , and summing the counts across the dispersion with optimal weighting . in the order spanning h@xmath0 , the pixel scale was @xmath35    pixel@xmath17 and the full - width at half - maximum of arc lines was approximately 4 pixels .",
    "the resulting one - dimensional spectra had a typical signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath36 in each pixel .",
    "exposures taken with the i@xmath21 cell were processed separately , using the standard procedures described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we determined the radial velocity based on the blue ccd only .",
    "figure [ fig : rv_hd209458 ] shows our measurements , which are uncertain by @xmath37  m  s@xmath17 , as estimated from the variance in results from 100 separate spectral segments in each exposure . the two points from october  25 , obtained at the start and end of the hd  209458 observations on that night , bracket zero radial velocity ( orbital phase 0.5 ) , confirming our expectation that the transit took place between those times .",
    "during the transit , the planet blocks a portion of the stellar surface , causing the flux received from the star to decrease .",
    "our goal was not to measure the transit light curve , which would have required observations of a comparison star to correct for flux variations due to earth s atmosphere .",
    "rather , our goal was to measure differences between the light curve observed in h@xmath0 and at other wavelengths , effectively using part of the parent star s spectrum as the comparison signal .",
    "for exospheric effects to be detectable , they must not only be large enough to overcome the poisson noise in the starlight , but they must also be distinguished from spectral variations caused by instabilities in the earth s atmosphere and the spectrograph . in this section",
    "we describe the method we used to attempt to make this distinction .",
    "figure  [ fig : differences ] compares two representative spectra that were taken 2.5  hours apart .",
    "the top three panels show three consecutive orders bracketing h@xmath0 , the strong absorption feature at 6563   .",
    "we refer to these spectra as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the @xmath41th wavelength bin within the @xmath42th spectral order .",
    "note that we have not normalized the spectra ; the continua are peaked near the middle of each order due to the blaze function of the spectrograph .",
    "the green points in the bottom three panels of figure  [ fig : differences ] show the ratios @xmath43 .",
    "the mean of the ratio spectrum is not unity , which is expected , because of variations in total flux received in each exposure caused by the earth s atmosphere .",
    "more surprising are the wavelength variations in the ratio spectra : there are @xmath44% variations varying smoothly over @xmath45  scales .",
    "we believe these variations are not an artifact of the extraction procedure , because the same variations were obtained from spectra that were extracted using different aperture sizes , and from spectra that were extracted using custom - built procedures in the interactive data language ( idl ) rather than iraf .",
    "the variations are surely instrumental , because the pattern is very similar in each order : the ratio spectrum is a function of @xmath41 rather than @xmath46 , and depends on @xmath42 to a much lesser degree .",
    "the ratio spectra also exhibit a smooth time dependence .",
    "in particular , the wavelength variations are greatest when one of the spectra involved in the ratio was taken at the beginning of the night .",
    "this was when the target was near zenith and the instrument rotator was moving most quickly .",
    "the ratio spectra are flatter when the two spectra were taken with nearly the same rotation angle .",
    "for these reasons , we hypothesize that these apparent variations in the blaze function are caused by flexure of the spectrograph .",
    "similar variations have been seen by other observers using subaru / hds ( e.g. , nagao et al .",
    "2003 ) and also keck / hires ( e.g. , suzuki et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we corrected for this effect empirically by using the pattern observed in the adjacent orders . to correct the @xmath42th order",
    ", we computed @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and then smoothed each of these functions in @xmath41 with a boxcar size of 100 pixels ( 2   ) , giving @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we then used linear regression to determine the two numbers @xmath51 and @xmath52 that minimized the sum of squared residuals between @xmath53 and @xmath54 s_2(\\lambda_{n , j}).\\ ] ] for a given pair of spectra we typically found @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting `` blaze corrected '' ratio spectrum , @xmath56 , is near unity with a standard deviation within 10% of that expected from the poisson statistics ( see black dots in figure  [ fig : differences ] ) .",
    "next , we corrected for small variations in the wavelength scale by determining the two numbers @xmath57 and @xmath58 that provided the best match between @xmath53 and @xmath59 where the derivative was approximated numerically by 3-point lagrangian interpolation .",
    "the wavelength shifts were always smaller than 0.005    ( 0.25  pixel ) .",
    "we refer to @xmath60 as the `` matched '' spectrum ; it has been matched in blaze function and wavelength scale to @xmath53 .",
    "having established this matching procedure to correct for instrumental variations between any pair of spectra , we created a template spectrum with a high signal - to - noise ratio in the following manner .",
    "a spectrum from the middle of the night was chosen as a reference spectrum .",
    "all the spectra taken through an air mass less than 1.4 were matched to the reference spectrum .",
    "( spectra taken through larger air masses were significantly contaminated by time - variable telluric lines , as will be seen shortly . )",
    "the preliminary template spectrum was defined as the median of all the matched spectra .",
    "then , the entire procedure was repeated , using the preliminary template spectrum as the reference spectrum , resulting in the final template spectrum @xmath61 .",
    "finally , a time series of difference spectra was created , by subtracting each spectrum from the suitably matched template .",
    "some examples of the difference spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : residual_spectra ] , for a 55    region in the vicinity of h@xmath0 .",
    "the difference spectra are plotted in units of poisson deviates , @xmath62 with the space between minor tick marks indicating one poisson deviation .",
    "also plotted are the template spectrum ( bottom ) and the estimated telluric spectrum ( top ) . to produce the telluric spectrum",
    ", we created a template spectrum for hd  42545 in the same way as we did for hd  209458 .",
    "then we removed the rotationally broadened h@xmath0 absorption line ( which had a full - width at half - maximum of @xmath511   ) by fitting a smooth polynomial to the spectrum and dividing by this polynomial .",
    "we note that the telluric spectrum is shown for visual reference only ; we did not use it in any of the calculations described below .",
    "the difference spectra are nearly consistent with poisson noise : they have standard deviations near unity , as expected .",
    "however , a close inspection of figure  [ fig : residual_spectra ] shows the residuals are not truly random .",
    "for spectra taken through large air masses ( late times ) , telluric lines are visible .",
    "in addition , there are excursions of order 12@xmath18 that are evident as `` ripples '' on scales of 25    ( 100250 pixels ) . for example",
    ", the spectrum at @xmath63 shows a sawtooth pattern in the residuals between 6535 and 6545   .",
    "we do not know the cause of these ripples , but we are confident that they are not due to the exosphere of the planet , for two reasons : they are not specific to any particular absorption line in the stellar spectrum ; and they also appear in spectra taken on october  27 , when the planet was not transiting .",
    "there are no obviously significant features in the difference spectra at the position of h@xmath0 , implying that once the spectra have been adjusted to correct for total flux and instrumental effects , there is no significant difference between the h@xmath0 light curve and those of neighboring bands . to plot these light curves",
    ", we computed the fractional difference in flux between the spectrum and the matched template , @xmath64 }          { \\displaystyle \\int_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2 } d\\lambda   \\hspace{0.1 in } t_{\\rm m}(\\lambda ) } \\ ] ] for the 3 different wavelength bands indicated in figure  [ fig : residual_spectra ] : a band centered on h@xmath0 ( green ) , and two comparison bands ( red and blue ) in the adjacent continua . the width of the h@xmath0 band ( 5.13   ) was chosen to match the @xmath65 of the band over which @xcite reported ly@xmath0 absorption . the central wavelength of the h@xmath0 band was shifted to compensate for the time - variable doppler shift of the planetary orbit .",
    "this shift is evident as a tilt in the green lines of figure 3 .",
    "the central wavelengths of the comparison bands were chosen to avoid telluric lines and strong stellar absorption lines , as much as possible .",
    "the widths of the red ( 3.87   ) and blue ( 3.61   ) comparison bands were chosen such that all three bands have the same total flux in the template spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : timeseries ] shows the light curve @xmath66 for each of the three bands .",
    "apart from a few outliers , the variations in the h@xmath0 band are similar in size and character to the variations in the comparison bands .",
    "the red and blue light curves exhibit small ( and opposite ) gradients which are probably effects of increasing air mass .    to place a quantitative limit on excess h@xmath0 absorption , we calculated @xmath67 , the mean value of @xmath66 for spectra taken during transit ( between second and third contacts ) . as an estimate of the uncertainty in @xmath67",
    ", we computed the standard deviation of @xmath66 for the 12 in - transit spectra and divided by @xmath68 .",
    "likewise , we computed @xmath69 and its uncertainty from the spectra taken before first contact or after fourth contact .",
    "d ( robichon and arenou 2000 ) . ]",
    "then we computed @xmath70 , which would be negative if there were extra h@xmath0 absorption during transit .",
    "for the 5.13    band , the result is @xmath71 .",
    "we investigated the dependence of this limit upon bandwidth , by repeating this procedure for bands varying in width from 0.5    to 10   , centered on h@xmath0 .",
    "the results are shown in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : timeseries ] . finally , we tried blueshifting the 5.13    h@xmath0 band by @xmath16  km  s@xmath17 , to match the possible blueshift in ly@xmath0 observed by vidal - madjar et al .",
    "the outcome was also a null result , @xmath72 .",
    "although our spectrum - matching procedure was intended to correct only for instrumental and telluric effects , it also acts to dilute any real signal . to estimate the size of this effect we injected an artificial signal into the data .",
    "we multiplied the extracted spectra by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a gaussian function centered on h@xmath0 with a full - width at half - maximum of 3    ( a fairly arbitrary choice , since the true width of the absorbing feature is unknown ) , representing a total flux decrement of 0.1% in the 5.13  band over which @xmath75 was measured . when the preceding analysis was performed on the adulterated data , the result was @xmath76 .",
    "this is greater by 0.00057 than the measurement with no artificial signal , verifying that the artificial signal ( although diluted ) could be recovered in spite of the noise .",
    "we conclude than an extra 0.1% absorption during transit would have been detected .",
    "figure  [ fig : timeseries_fake ] shows the resulting light curve @xmath66 and the `` measured '' absorption as a function of the width of the h@xmath0 band .",
    "fundamentally , our null result corresponds to a maximum number of neutral hydrogen atoms in the @xmath2 state that are present in the exosphere of hd  209458b .",
    "likewise , the detection of ly@xmath0 absorption by vidal - madjar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) implies a minimum number of neutral hydrogen atoms in the @xmath77 state .",
    "unfortunately it is difficult to use these results to constrain interesting quantities such as the exospheric temperature and density , because the physical conditions in the exosphere are likely to be quite complex .",
    "the column density of neutral hydrogen may vary widely across the surface of the primary star due to evaporation , tidal forces , and radiation pressure ( see , e.g. , lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "gas may be present at a variety of temperatures and densities , and may be far from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "[ even in the denser atmosphere , non - lte effects may be required to explain the unexpectedly weak detection of sodium by charbonneau et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , as proposed by barman et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and fortney et al .",
    "] obviously the limited empirical information available is not sufficient by itself to determine a realistic physical exosphere models .    with these caveats",
    ", we can use a simple order - of - magnitude argument to provide an upper limit on the column density of @xmath2 neutral hydrogen that exosphere models will need to obey . in order to translate our upper limit on additional h@xmath0 absorption into a corresponding upper limit on the h@xmath0 equivalent width , we combined the in - transit spectra to form @xmath78 , and we combined the out - of - transit spectra to form @xmath79 .",
    "then the equivalent width @xmath80 of any transit absorption feature is @xmath81.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] performing the integral over the 5    band described in the previous section , we find @xmath82  m .",
    "if we further assume that the fraction of the stellar surface covered by the exosphere is @xmath83 ( as estimated from the ly@xmath0 result ) , then the null result implies that h@xmath0 absorption is weak , and the corresponding limit on the column density of @xmath2 atoms ( @xmath84 ) is determined via @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the oscillator strength of the @xmath87 transition .",
    "the resulting limit is @xmath88  @xmath4 .    in principle , @xmath89 could be estimated from the ly@xmath0 decrement observed during transits , and the ratio @xmath90 could be related to the h  i excitation temperature . in reality",
    ", @xmath89 is highly uncertain because the absorption is probably saturated , and the line profile is unobservable due to interstellar absorption and geocoronal emission .",
    "however , any exosphere model that specifies @xmath89 is constrained by our results to have a maximum excitation temperature @xmath91 , according to the relation @xmath92 this constraint appears to be important in the context of recently proposed models in which the exosphere is very hot and hydrodynamically escaping , as argued below .",
    "the temperature of the lower atmosphere of hd  209458b is likely to be near the radiative effective temperature , @xmath93  k , at which the @xmath2 population predicted from equation  ( [ eq : n1n2ratio2 ] ) is utterly negligible .",

    "( 2001 ) , lammer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the exosphere is likely to be significantly hotter than @xmath94 , just as the exosphere of jupiter is considerably hotter than its lower atmosphere ( @xmath510@xmath95  k vs.150  k ; see , e.g. , atreya 1986 ) .",
    "lammer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that close - in gas giant planets could have exospheric temperatures up to @xmath96  k due to intense x - ray and extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) irradiation .",
    "depending on the density of neutral hydrogen and other factors , such a hot exosphere could produce detectable h@xmath0 absorption in violation of our constraint .",
    "for example , lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "( 2004 ) presented 3 models for the thermosphere and exosphere of hd  209458b . in each case",
    "they specified the density profile of neutral hydrogen and computed the size and shape of the exosphere as a function of kinetic temperature @xmath97 , taking tidal distortion into account .",
    "for the specific case of model a , the density is @xmath98  @xmath99 at the base of the thermosphere , and decreases with radius according to the barometric law .",
    "we computed the average column density @xmath89 within the annulus reaching from the thermobase to the roche radius , and then used equation  ( [ eq : n1n2ratio2 ] ) to translate our upper limit on @xmath84 into an upper limit on the excitation temperature , finding @xmath100  k. by comparison , lecavelier des etangs et al .",

    "a full non - lte exosphere model will need to accommodate the resulting upper limit on the excitation temperature .    in summary",
