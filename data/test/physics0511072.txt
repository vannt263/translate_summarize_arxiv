    "the transmission of light through optical fibers is ubiquitous in optics .",

    "vibrations and temperature changes thus cause an unwanted modulation of the optical path length @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the index of refraction of the fiber core and @xmath2 the mechanical length ) , thus phase modulating the transmitted signal . even for fibers as short as a few meters under quiet laboratory conditions ,",
    "the phase fluctuations easily exceed @xmath3 on a timescale of seconds .",
    "when using fibers to transmit light between laboratories or different buildings , the corresponding broadening of the spectrum reaches several khz @xcite . at first glance , this may appear negligible against the frequency of optical radiation .",
    "however , the tremendous progress in optical frequency stabilization has lead to lasers with a linewidth of one hz and below @xcite .",
    "such lasers are applied , for example , in optical clocks @xcite and tests of fundamental laws of physics @xcite .",
    "precision atomic physics experiments use phase - locked lasers having @xmath4rad rms relative phase fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it is clear that transmission of such signals through fibers most significantly degrades their frequency and phase stability .",
    "path length fluctuations may also have considerable effects in other fields : for example , quantum cryptography bridges distances exceeding 100 km by fibers and is now beginning to be a commercial technology .",
    "fiber length fluctuations are important in this context , since some concepts use interferometry to detect the quantum state of photons @xcite . for global frequency comparisons at the targeted precision of next generation optical atomic clocks ( @xmath5 )",
    ", doppler - shifts caused by the continental drift ( at a velocity of @xmath6 cm per year ) will have to be controlled .",
    "moreover , fiber length fluctuations have been identified as a limit on the frequency noise of optical comb generators @xcite .",
    "they also may play a role in space experiments like the lisa und lisa pathfinder missions , which use mach - zehnder interferometers that have fibers in the interferometer arms .",
    "there is thus a strong and increasing need for a simple and reliable method to remove fiber path length fluctuations .",
    "removal of the unwanted effects of the path length fluctuations traces back to the ` ultra - stable fiber optics link ' over 29 km used by krisher _",
    "et al . _ in a test of special relativity @xcite .",
    "this is based on simultaneously sending two counterpropagating signals through the same fiber . by measuring the ratio of the sent and received frequencies at each side , the path length fluctuations are determined and",
    "can be corrected numerically .",
    "( based on the same principle , frequencies can be accurately transferred to , from , and between spacecraft , with cancellation of the doppler effect due to the relative motion .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    ") however , active cancellation of the noise generated by fibers has first been achieved by l .- s .",
    "they use an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) to pre - modulate the phase of the light incident to the fiber with the negative image of the fiber noise , so that the noise is cancelled when the light passes the fiber . to gain the necessary information about the fiber induced noise , a  probe \" part of the signal is picked up at the fiber output and shifted by a constant frequency using a second aom located at the output side of the fiber .",
    "it is then sent back through the fiber . thus passing the fiber twice ,",
    "the probe has picked up twice the phase shifts induced by the fiber .",
    "the beat note with the original light thus contains twice the fiber phase noise .",
    "the beat note frequency is electronically divided by two and used for driving the first aom at the input side , which thus pre - modulates the light with the precise negative of the fiber phase noise . restricting the bandwidth of the beat signal to about 10khz ( using a tracking vco )",
    "avoids the introduction of additional wide - band noise into the signal path .",
    "a fiber with 25 m length is used and phase noise is suppressed by 30db to a level of -60dbc / hz between 0.1 and 2khz , corresponding to residual length fluctuations below @xmath7nm/@xmath8 .",
    "based on this method , a 3.5 km fiber optics link has been established between the jila and national institute of standards and technology laboratories in boulder , colorado @xcite .",
    "the stabilization reduced the fiber - induced frequency noise at 1s integration time from about @xmath9 to @xmath10 ( corresponding to @xmath7rad rms phase noise , or about 200 nm rms length fluctuations ) ; a 100 m link between laboratories in the same building ( the max - planck institute for quantum optics in garching , germany ) achieved a stability of 23mhz @xcite .",
    "a 43 km link reached @xmath11 stability at 1s integration time @xcite . besides , this technique has applications in tests of fundamental physics @xcite ( where a 180 m long link is used ) , and may even be useful in quantum optics and atomic physics experiments , including quantum computing and cryptography @xcite .      in the approach described above , rather than stabilizing the path length , the resulting frequency fluctuations are corrected for by an aom . while this is all that is needed in many cases , it has a couple of disadvantages : ( i ) the aom has a finite deflection efficiency and thus reduces the transmitted power .",
    "( ii ) when transmitting two laser frequencies @xmath12 and @xmath13 , path length changes at a velocity @xmath14 produce two different frequency shifts of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "thus , the correction by the aom works for one frequency only .",
    "this significantly reduces the degree of cancellation of noise if the frequencies @xmath12 and @xmath13 differ by more than a few per - cent .",
    "this may practically occur , for example when simultaneously transmitting a laser frequency and its second harmonic or even components of a femtosecond optical frequency comb .    in this paper , we describe the use of controlled heating of ( a part of ) the fiber for stabilizing or modulating the optical path length . it achieves a performance similar to that of the method reported by ma _",
    "et al._. we directly stabilize the path length itself rather than compensating for the phase modulation caused by the fluctuations and thus avoid the above disadvantages .",

    "thermal time constants can easily be of the order of minutes or longer .",
    "thus , if heating is to be used as an actuator in a fast servo loop that achieves sub - wavelength stability , the dynamic response of the path length to heating has to be considered carefully .",
    "previous studies of the static @xcite and the dynamic response @xcite assume that the fiber surface is heated to a fixed temperature by an external thermal source .",
    "however , for fast temperature changes , this assumption becomes unrealistic , since the finite thermal conductivity of any material precludes the instantaneous application of a fixed temperature .",
    "rather , the dynamic characteristics of the thermal source itself have to be taken into account .",
    "we discuss the magnitude and the phase of the response , the latter being of prime interest for the design of a servo loop .    in our model , the response of the path length @xmath0 is given by changes in the index of refraction @xmath1 and the physical length @xmath2 of the fiber core : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the thermooptic coefficient and @xmath19 denotes the temperature change of the fiber core .",

    "the amplitudes have been multiplied by the frequency @xmath67 .",
    "for frequencies below about 1hz , the amplitudes of the core temperature and the strain term are proportional to @xmath68 ; their phases equal @xmath69 .",
    "this is because we neglect heat dissipation to the environment , which means that the actual thermal energy within the fiber is the integral of the heating rate over time .",
    "in practice , this is a good approximation for frequencies above about @xmath70hz . at lower frequencies ,",
    "the temperature of the fiber will be given by an equilibrium between heating and dissipation .",
    "thus , the frequency response of the strain and core temperature terms will become constant below about 0.1hz .",
    "the phase will then be 0@xmath71 .",
    "it is , of course , possible to incorporate dissipation into the above model .",
    "however , the heat dissipation is hard to quantify because of air currents , moreover , it is irrelevant for the design of the fiber length feedback loop as it has significant effects only for frequencies much below the loop bandwidth .    for frequencies above about 0.5hz ,",
    "the magnitude of both terms begins to drop , and the phase lags increase correspondingly . for the core temperature term",
    ", this is because fast temperature changes are attenuated on their way to the core due to the finite thermal conductivity .",
    "the core temperature term drops rapidly with increasing frequency and gains a large phase shift , which exceeds 180@xmath71 for frequencies as low as 1hz .",
    "this bandwidth is much too low for an effective removal of the path length fluctuations by a servo loop .",
    "study of the strain term @xmath72 , however , reveals a much more favorable behavior . like the core temperature term",
    ", it starts to drop for frequencies above about 0.5hz , but only very mildly , proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "this because the strain term does not depend on the slow heat diffusion to the core alone .",
    "rather , strain generated in the outer layers of the fiber , which are closer to the heater , is transmitted to the core at the velocity of sound .",
    "the @xmath74 rolloff ( in addition to the overall @xmath68 one ) arises because the depth to which the temperature changes penetrate the fiber becomes thinner with increasing frequency .",
    "this mild frequency response is crucial for the performance of the servo : the @xmath73 rolloff at @xmath75 total phase shift enables a fast and stable servo loop .",
    "the actual frequency dependence of the strain term shown in fig .",
    "[ allresponse ] ( left ) is a consequence of the very low elastic modulus of the heater coating .",
    "a heater out of a more rigid material will cause a different , and even more interesting , response .",

    "[ [ aluminum - coated - fiber ] ] aluminum - coated fiber + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    aluminum coated fiber , where the al coating is used as the heater , has a frequency response which is even more suitable for the present application , see fig .",

    "apart from a general @xmath68 response , the core temperature term begins to roll - off at a frequency of @xmath76hz , much larger than for plastic jacket .",
    "this is because of the much larger thermal conductivity of the al coating as compared to acryl , and because the al coating as a heater attaches dirctly to the core .",

    "as the al layer is much thicker than the core , the stiffness of the fiber is almost completely due to the al heater layer .",
    "heat is generated throughout the volume of the al coating , and there it causes strain instantaneously .",
    "this strain is propagated to the core at the high velocity of sound .    [",

    "the gold coating is used as the heater .",
    "the strain term is not dominant at low frequencies ( because the stiffness of the fiber is dominated by the quartz glass core , with its low thermal expansion coefficient ) , but overtakes for larger frequencies .",
    "the magnitude of the strain term depicts a roll - off of slightly less than @xmath68 for frequencies between 100 and 10000hz .",
    "the reason can be explained as follows : the thermal expansion coefficient of quartz glass is much lower than that of gold .",
    "most stress is thus generated in the thin gold coating , and the resulting strain is reduced by the core due to its low thermal expansion coefficient . at low frequencies , the core also takes away a significant fraction of the thermal energy , thus reducing the amplitude of the temperature in the heater volume , thereby reducing the generated stress . at high frequencies ,",
    "however , the finite thermal conductivity reduces the heat transfer to the core , so that the temperature variation is no longer reduced by heat transfer .",
    "[ [ discussion ] ] discussion + + + + + + + + + +    the phase modulation depth that can be achieved by heating is limited by the permissible temperature and hence the power dissipation of the heater . assuming a very moderate heater power of 1w per meter of fiber length",

    "the higher values are obtained for the aluminum- and gold - coated fibers , where this figure drops like @xmath68 ( for the plastic - jacketed fiber , it drops with @xmath73 ) .",
    "the validity of the above model is limited at higher frequencies , since we assumed instantaneous sound propagation .",
    "sound , however , propagates at a velocity of several 1000 m/s . for a fiber radius of 400@xmath77 m",
    ", this means that fiber will deviate from the above model on a time scale of the order of 0.1@xmath78s , or frequencies of a few mhz . since the additional delay due to the finite velocity will increase the phase lag at high frequencies , this represents a theoretical limit on the speed of any feedback loop based on heating of a fiber . in view of the very limited modulation amplitude that can be reached at such high frequencies , however , heating of the fiber can not take out a disturbance of any appreciable amplitude at such frequencies , even if the linearized feedback loop would theoretically be stable",
    "the basic setup is shown in figure [ etalon ] . for reading out the instantaneous length of the fiber ,",
    "we use the method developed by pound , drever , and hall @xcite for reading out the resonance frequency of a resonant cavity .",
    "indeed , the fiber with its about 4% parasitic reflection at each end resembles a fabry - perot etalon , although one with a quite low finesse .",

    "the modulation at a frequency of @xmath79khz with a modulation index of about 1 ( however , these parameters are not critical for the performance of the active length control ) is generated by modulating the strain of the nd : yag monolithic ring cavity with a piezo . from the output of the fiber , we split off a sample and detect its intensity .",
    "alternatively , the detector can be placed at the input of the fiber .",
    "this makes the setup extremely simple , as no additional components are required at the remote end of the fiber .    due to the frequency modulation ( fm ) , the laser radiation acquires additional fourier components at frequencies @xmath80 (  sidebands \" ) , where @xmath81 is the laser frequency . for pure fm ,",
    "the phase relationship between these components is such that the amplitude of the signal is unaffected .",
    "the resonant and dispersive properties of the fiber alter these phase relationships",
    ". in general , this converts the pure frequency modulation into amplitude modulation ( am ) components at multiples of @xmath82 . when the laser and the resonance frequency coincide , the detected component of the am vanishes ; if they are detuned , however , a nonzero am is found ,",
    "whose amplitude indicates the magnitude and whose phase relative to the fm indicates the direction of the detuning .",
    "the detector signal is multiplied with a local oscillator ( lo ) signal at @xmath82 in a double - balanced mixer ( dbm ) , and the output of the dbm is low - pass filtered to suppress the modulation frequency . with the correct lo phase @xmath83 , a error signal is thus generated that indicates the deviation of the optical path length of the fiber relative to a multiple of half the laser wavelength .",
    "this signal serves as input to a proportional - integral servo , which controls the fiber length by heating a part of the fiber . for determining the gain and time constants of the servo",
    ", we use the results of our above study of the the dynamic response of the fiber ( fig .",

    "since a servo loop is stable for a @xmath73 rolloff with a corresponding phase shift of 135 degrees , it can operate throughout the frequency range discussed in the above model",
    ".    the most suitable fiber would be the aluminum - jacketed or gold - coated ones ( tab .",
    "[ fibers ] ) .",
    "the most undesirable one , from the point of view of high servo speed , is plastic - jacketed fiber , because the plastic jacket is thick and has poor thermal conductivity .",
    "the results of the previous section , however , show that even in this case loop bandwidths of several 100hz can be achieved .    to demonstrate that even in this case a satisfactory performance can be obtained , we used a 5 m long polarization maintaining fiber with plastic jacket ( thor labs type fs - pm-4511 ) .",
    "we tried two different methods to attach a heater layer to it : a manganine wire wrapped around the fiber did not work because of the bad thermal contact between the wire and the fiber .",

    "occasionally , it breaks at its weakest point , which makes further length controlling impossible .",
    "although the defect can easily be repaired and the fiber itself does not suffer any damage , a reliable long - term performance requires a more stable solution , like using of aluminum - jacketed fiber ( tab .",

    "additionally , since the fiber with parasitic reflections at its ends acts like a fabry - perot etalon , it adds parasitic signal components into the pound - drever - hall error signal used for feeding back to the laser frequency .",
    "these change from maximum to minimum for a @xmath93 length change of the fiber and cause an unwanted fluctuation of the baseline of the error signal ( fig .",

    "thus , the fiber is always operated with maximum transmission , where the front and the back reflex cancel . a straight baseline free of etalon fringes seen in fig . [ etalonsig ] ( above ) and a constant signal amplitude at maximum value",

    "a theoretical study of the response of the optical path length to heat dissipated in the bulk of a heater layer indicates that servo bandwidths in the khz range , or indeed even the low mhz range , can be obtained .",
    "this high speed is possible because strain is instantaneously generated at the heated surface .",
    "it then propagates to the fiber core at the speed of sound , which is a much faster process than heat diffusion .",

    "it uses a conductive coating made of silver varnish on a plastic - jacketed fiber .",
    "we used this method in the context of an optical frequency standard based on a cryogenic optical resonator .",
    "compared to previous work , our method has the advantage of directly removing the path length fluctuations , rather than compensating for them via an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) .",
    "thus , it can reduce the phase noise induced by such fluctuations for any signals , even those for which aoms are not suitable .",
    "an example for such a signal are broadband optical signals like those generated by optical frequency comb generators .",
    "it also avoids the loss due to the finite deflection efficiency of an aom .",
    "a modulator may be necessary to provide the phase modulation used for measuring the actual fiber length .",
    "however , as in the example above , such a modulation may already be present in a particular setup .",
    "else , it can be generated by an electro - optical modulator , which has much lower insertion loss than an aom , and whose operation does not depend on the laser wavelength as the one of an aom . in principle",
    ", the modulation only needs to be applied for one reference beam that provides for the fiber length measurement .",
    "thus , this modulation is no obstacle in applications with a large wavelength range .    the simple realization of the active stabilization leaves plenty of space for further developments .",
    "use of aluminum - jacketed fiber can enhance the reliability and also increase significantly the useful lock bandwidth .",
    "this leads to better stability of the path length .",
    "another approach is bare fiber coated with a gold layer , which leads to even higher speed .",
    "also , one can study the influence of ( and optimize ) the environment the fiber is in .",
    "presumably , by thermal and acoustical shielding , a substantial improvement of the noise can be reached , at least for certain noise frequencies . in analogy to the method of ma _ et al .",
    "_ , however , we expect that our method surpasses the stability of such passive stabilization ( see , for example , @xcite ) by 20 - 30db @xcite .",
    "we expect that the method can soon be routinely applied in many applications mentioned in the introduction , that require the transmission of an optical signal through fiber with exceptional stability .",
    "to give an example , consider the 3.5 km long fiber in ref .",
    "the feedback bandwidth used in this work was about 10khz , which can be attained , for example , with the al- or au - coated fibers as described above .",
    "thus , we have a sufficiently fast actuator to obtain a similar degree of suppression of perturbations . a similar level of accuracy should thus be obtained . to achieve sufficient dynamic range",
    ", it would be necassary to equip no more than about 1/10 of the total fiber length with the heater ( assuming that the dynamic range of the heater is more than 10 times larger than the variation of the external temperature ) .",
    "however , the easiest way would probably be to obtain a commercial al - jacketed fiber and to control the whole path .",
    "the question is , which method is easier to implement ? obviously , the old method allows to use any kind of fiber .",
    "ours , on the other hand , has advantages if the loss associated with the aom is critical or if a broad range of laser frequencies is to be transmitted at the same time ( like the simultaneous transmission of a laser frequency along with its first harmonic or even a femtosecond frequency comb ) .",
    "the phase shift of those signals could not be compensated for using a single aom .",
