    "in an earlier paper @xcite we studied the problem of hadron production in the transfragmentation region ( tfr ) in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it was stimulated by the data of phobos @xcite that show the detection of charged particles at @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "we broadly refer to the @xmath7 region as tfr .",
    "however , since the transverse momenta @xmath3 of the particles were not measured , it has not been possible to determine the corresponding values of feynman @xmath9 , in terms of which tfr can more precisely be defined as the region with @xmath10 .",
    "more recently , brahams has analyzed their forward production data at @xmath11 gev with both @xmath12 and @xmath3 determined @xcite .",
    "it is then possible to interpret brahms data by applying the formalism developed in @xcite , which is done entirely in the framework of using momentum fractions instead of @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we calculate the proton and pion distributions in @xmath9 and @xmath3 and conclude not only that the @xmath13 ratio is large , but also that there should be no jet structure associated with the particles detected at any @xmath3 in the forward region .    in @xcite the @xmath9 distributions of @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "have been calculated for @xmath16 in the recombination model @xcite , taking into account momentum degradation of particle constituents traversing nuclear matter @xcite and the recombination of partons arising from different beam nucleons .",
    "however , we have not considered the regeneration of soft partons as a consequence of momentum degradation in the nuclear medium . since",
    "such soft partons significantly increase the antiquark distribution in the mid-@xmath9 region , it is important to include them in the determination of the pion distribution .",
    "furthermore , no consideration has been given in @xcite to transverse momentum , which is the other major concern in this paper .    in the following",
    "we use forward production to refer specifically to hadrons produced at @xmath17 , with the fragmentation region ( fr ) being @xmath18 , and tfr being @xmath19 .",
    "any hadron produced in the tfr can not be due to the fragmentation of any parton because of momentum conservation , since no parton can have momentum fraction @xmath20 , if we ignore the minor effect of fermi motion of the nucleons in a nucleus . in the fr hadrons with any @xmath3 that are kinematically",
    "allowed can , in principle , arise from the fragmentation of hard partons ; however , the momenta of those hard partons must be even higher than the detected hadrons in the fr , and the probability of hard scattering into the region near the kinematical boundary is severely suppressed @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is the additional suppression due to the fragmentation function from parton to hadron .",
    "thus the fragmentation of partons at any @xmath3 in the fr ( despite the nomenclature that has its roots in reference to the fragmentation of the incident hadron ) is highly unlikely , though not impossible .",
    "the issue to focus on is then to examine whether there can be any hadrons produced in the fr with any significant @xmath3 .",
    "if so , then such hadrons at any @xmath3 would not be due to fragmentation and would therefore not have any associated jet structure .",
    "in contrast to the double suppression discussed above in connection with fragmentation , recombination benefits from double support from two factors .",
    "one is the additivity of the parton momenta in hadronization , thus allowing the contributing partons to be at lower @xmath9 where the density of partons is higher .",
    "the other is that those partons can arise from different forward - going nucleons , thus making possible the sum of their momentum fractions to vary smoothly across @xmath21 , thereby amalgamating fr with tfr .",
    "these are the two attributes of the recombination process that makes it particularly relevant for forward production .",
    "its implementation , however , relies on two extensions of what has been considered in @xcite , namely , the regeneration of soft partons and the transverse - momentum aspect of the problem , before we can compare our results with brahms data @xcite .",
    "it is useful to outline the logical connections among the different parts of this work .",
    "first of all , the degree of degradation of forward momenta through the nuclear medium is unknown .",
    "the degradation parameter @xmath22 can be determined phenomenologically if the @xmath9 s of the forward proton and pion are known , but they are not .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath9 s for @xmath23 and 0.8 as typical values serving as benchmarks .",
    "since the normalization of the  , which is known from brahms data @xcite , depends on the @xmath9 , @xmath22 can be determined by fitting the   .",
    "however , what is known about the  is only for all charged particles , not @xmath14 or @xmath15 separately .",
    "if there were experimental data on the @xmath13 ratio ( which is not yet available for the 62.4 gev data that have the  ) , one could disentangle the species dependence .",
    "fortunately , there exist preliminary data on @xmath0 and @xmath24 ratios at 62.4 gev .",
    "we shall therefore calculate the @xmath14 and @xmath25 s and adjust @xmath22 to render the ratio @xmath26 to be in the vicinity of the observed ratio .",
    "we shall then show that the  of all charged particles can be well reproduced in our calculation .",
    "we shall assume factorizability in @xmath27 and  dependences .",
    "the two are treated in sec .",
    "ii and iii , respectively .",
    "the main difference between sec .",
    "ii and the earlier work in @xcite is the inclusion of the regeneration of soft partons , a subject we now address .",
    "let us first recall some basic equations from ref .",
    "@xcite , which we shall refer to as i. equations i-(16 ) and i-(32 ) give the proton and pion s in @xmath9 ( with the  variables integrated out ) for @xmath28 collisions in the recombination model @xmath29 where the hadronic @xmath9 is @xmath30 and the partonic @xmath31 are momentum fractions .",
    "the recombination functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are given in @xcite .",
    "the partons are assumed to arise from different nucleons in the projectile nucleus @xmath34 and thus contribute in factorizable form of @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the average number of wounded nucleons that a nucleon encounters in traversing the nucleus @xmath38 at a particular impact parameter , given in eq .",
    "the effect of momentum degradation on the parton s is contained in the expressions @xmath39 where @xmath22 is the average momentum fraction of a valon after each collision and @xmath40 is the valon  in momentum fraction @xmath41 before collision @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 are the quark s in a valon , with @xmath44 @xmath45 being the valence - quark  and @xmath43 the saturated sea - quark  after gluon conversion .",
    "this briefly summarizes the essence of determining the @xmath9 s of protons and pions produced in @xmath28 collisions .    to describe how the above",
    "should be modified in order to take into account the regeneration of soft partons , we need to fill in the steps on how sea - quark  @xmath43 is derived .",
    "in addition to the valence quark in a valon , there are also sea quarks ( @xmath46 ) , strange quark ( @xmath47 ) and gluons ( @xmath48 ) , whose s are denoted by @xmath49 .",
    "their second moments satisfy the sum rule for momentum conservation @xcite @xmath50 + \\tilde{l}_g(2 ) = 1 \\ . \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] gluon conversion to @xmath51 changes the sea - quark  to @xmath52 whose second moment satisfies the modified version of eq .",

    "the @xmath70-quark , @xmath71 , and @xmath72-antiquark , @xmath73 , s before and after regeneration for @xmath64 mb and @xmath23 .",
    "note that with or without regeneration all s are highly peaked at @xmath74 because momentum degradation pushes all valons to lower momenta by a factor of @xmath75 ( which for @xmath76 is @xmath77 ) .",
    "regeneration increases @xmath73 significantly for @xmath78 , as shown by the dashed - dotted line above the dotted line . for @xmath71 , because of the dominance of the valence quark  @xmath45 , the increase is minimal , as the dashed line is nearly all covered by the solid line .",
    "similar changes occur for the @xmath79 and @xmath80 distributions .    in the same way as we have done in @xcite",
    "we calculate the proton and pion s in @xmath9 for @xmath23 and 0.8 and for @xmath64 and 8 fm .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "since the regenerated soft partons do not affect the hadron s for @xmath81 ( remembering that the hadron @xmath9 is the sum of the parton @xmath31 ) , we have plotted these figures for the range @xmath82 .",
    "we emphasize here that the large @xmath9 behavior in the tfr is not the central issue in this paper any more , as it was in @xcite .    in figs .  2 - 5 ,",
    "in addition to our present result with regeneration ( solid and dashed lines ) we show also our previous result obtained in @xcite without regeneration for the case @xmath23 for the purpose of seeing the effect of regeneration .",
    "note that the proton s in figs .",
    "2 and 3 are not affected very much by the regeneration effect , but the pion s in figs .",
    "4 and 5 are increased . at @xmath83",
    "the increase is roughly around a factor of 3 .    in @xcite",
    "there was no data to compare with the calculated result on the @xmath9 s. in particular , the degree of momentum degradation was unknown .",
    "now , brahms data show the  dependence at @xmath2 @xcite . in order to fit the  s of the hadrons produced",
    ", we must have the correct normalizations , which in turn depend on the @xmath9 s that we have studied .",
    "having determined the longitudinal part of the hadronic s above , modulo the value of @xmath22 , we now proceed to the transverse part .",
    "we have treated the degradation and regeneration problems on rather general grounds without restricting the @xmath9 values and with  integrated so that  never appears in our consideration of the @xmath9 .",
    "it is then natural to make use of that result in a factorizable form for the inclusive @xmath84 which is , of course , an assumed form that is sensible when there is negligible contribution from hard scattering .",
    "for the transverse part , @xmath85 , we follow the same type of consideration as developed in @xcite , where particle production at intermediate @xmath3 is shown to be dominated by the recombination process .",
    "similar work in that respect has also been done in @xcite . in the absence of hard scattering",
    "there are no shower partons . without shower partons",
    "there are only thermal partons to recombine .",
    "thus for pion production we have @xmath86 recombination , while for proton we have @xmath87 recombination , where @xmath88 represents the thermal parton distribution @xcite @xmath89 in the above equation @xmath90 is the transverse momentum of @xmath91th parton ; @xmath92 and @xmath93 are two parameters as yet undetermined for the forward region in au+au collisions . in view of the factorization in eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) we use the term thermal in the sense of local thermal equilibrium of the partons in the co - moving frame of a fluid cell whose velocity in the cm system corresponds to the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath9 . however , the value of @xmath93 can include radial flow effect .    limiting ourselves to only the transverse component , the invariant distributions of produced pion and proton due to thermal - parton recombination are @xmath94 @xmath95 where the proportionality factors that depend on the recombination functions are given in @xcite . at midrapidity ,",
    "thermal and chemical equilibrium led us to assume @xmath96 , and we have been able to obtain @xmath13 ratio in good agreement with the data .",
    "now , in fr ( and in tfr ) we must abandon chemical equilibrium , since @xmath97 can not have the same density as @xmath46 , when @xmath9 is large .",
    "but we do retain thermal equilibrium within each species of partons to justify eqs .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) for the @xmath3 dependence .",
    "we join the longitudinal and transverse parts of the problem by requiring @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the quark and antiquark distributions in their respective momentum fractions already studied in sec .",
    "the proportionality factors in the two expressions above are the same .",
    "equation ( [ 21 ] ) connects the parton density from the study of the longitudinal motion to the thermal distribution in the transverse motion . substituting those relations into eqs .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) , and letting @xmath101 and other multiplicative factors be absorbed in the formulas for @xmath102 developed in @xcite , we obtain for the transverse part of eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are two proportionality constants to be determined by the normalization condition @xmath107 i.e. , @xmath108 it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) that we recover the invariant @xmath9-distribution @xmath109 without undetermined proportionality factors .",
    "the exponential factors in eqs .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) give the characteristic behavior of hadrons produced by the recombination of thermal partons @xcite .",
    "such exponential behavior is overwhelmed by power - law behavior at intermediate @xmath3 due to thermal - shower recombination when @xmath9 is small and when light quarks contribute to the hadrons produced .",
    "however , when @xmath9 is large , the shower partons are absent due to the suppression of hard scattering , so the exponential @xmath3 dependence becomes the prevalent behavior in the forward region .",
    "since the data of brahms @xcite exhibit the @xmath3 distribution for a narrow range of @xmath12 around 3.2 , we can readily check whether eqs .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) , ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) are in accord with the data .",
    "we consider only the most central collisions for which @xmath110 and @xmath111 have been calculated in the previous section for @xmath64 fm .",
    "the data of the @xmath3 distribution in @xcite are , however , given for average charged particle @xmath112 . to be able to make comparison with that , we need information on the magnitudes of contributions from @xmath113 and @xmath25 .",
    "preliminary data on the @xmath24 ratio is @xmath114 @xcite , and that on the @xmath0 ratio is @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "we shall use the former ratio and calculate the latter .",
    "the enhanced @xmath116  enables us to compute @xmath117 exactly as in eq .",

    "the @xmath0 ratio is constant in , since both @xmath14 and @xmath25 have the same  dependence given in eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "the value of the ratio , however , depends on @xmath117 and @xmath120 .",
    "the value of @xmath9 for both @xmath14 and @xmath25 is chosen to be 0.55 for reasons to be explained below when we discuss the  .",
    "since the data on @xmath0 are preliminary and imprecise at this point , we consider two values of @xmath22 and obtain @xmath121 these results bracket the observed value of @xmath0 at @xmath115 for @xmath1 gev and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "note that with a 5% decrease in @xmath22 there is over 80% increase in @xmath0 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of soft - parton regeneration , where enhanced @xmath116  significantly increases the @xmath25 production . to learn about the effect of regeneration , we have calculated @xmath117 with the soft - parton regeneration turned off , and found that for @xmath122 and @xmath123 the ratio of the corresponding @xmath117 values with regeneration to that without is about 2000 . in other words without regeneration",
    "@xmath26 would be at the level of @xmath124 , which is hardly measurable .",
    "the increase of @xmath25 production due to regeneration is much more than the corresponding increase of @xmath15 ( shown in fig .",
    "4 ) for a good reason .",
    "it is not just a matter of @xmath25 consisting of three @xmath116 , while @xmath15 having only one @xmath116 .",
    "the pion recombination function is broad in the momentum fractions @xmath125 and @xmath126 , so with @xmath125 high it is possible for @xmath126 to be low to reach the region with higher density of @xmath116 .",
    "the proton recombination function is much narrower , since the proton mass is nearly at the threshold of the three constituent quark masses .",
    "the @xmath126 values are roughly 1/3 of @xmath127 , so none of the antiquarks can have very low @xmath126 for @xmath128 , say . the effect of soft - parton regeneration can therefore drastically increase the @xmath25 production .",
    "it is of interest to point out that the observed @xmath0 ratio changes significantly with energy . at @xmath129 gev and @xmath2",
    ", @xmath26 has been found to be 0.22 , which is four times larger than at @xmath1 gev @xcite .",
    "it implies that the degradation effect depends sensitively on @xmath130 .",
    "it also means that what other ratios have been measured at @xmath129 gev can not be used reliably as a guide for our present study at 62.4 gev .",
    "we are now able to relate the average charged multiplicity @xmath112 in the data to @xmath131/2 $ ] that we can calculate .",
    "since the data on the  are taken within the narrow band bounded by @xmath132 , we can determine the @xmath9 value in the range of @xmath3 of interest by first identifying @xmath12 with @xmath41 and use @xmath133 if we take @xmath134 gev / c , the corresponding values of @xmath9 for pion is @xmath135 and for proton , @xmath136 , which are well inside the fr .",
    "the slope of the  in the semilog plot is essentially determined by the value of @xmath93 , as prescribed by eqs .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "we find it to be @xmath137 mev . in our treatment here and before , the value of @xmath93 incorporates the effect of radial flow and is therefore larger than the value appropriate for local thermal temperature that is considered in other approaches to recombination @xcite . for the values of @xmath22 that can reproduce the @xmath0 ratio we can calculate @xmath131/2 $ ] , adjusting @xmath138 in fine - tuning , and",
    "obtain the two lines in fig .",
    "the solid line is for @xmath123 and @xmath139 gev / c , while the dashed line is for @xmath140 and @xmath141 gev / c .",
    "they both fit the data @xcite very well .",
    "the spectrum being dominated by proton does not depend on @xmath22 sensitively ; its normalization does depend on the @xmath9 values , which in turn depend on @xmath138 for fixed rapidity .",
    "for @xmath142 gev / c the corresponding @xmath143 is @xmath144 , which is the value we used to calculate @xmath0 .",
    "since the contributions from resonance decays have not been considered , our results for @xmath145 gev / c are not reliable , and should not be taken seriously .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the @xmath13 ratio for the two cases considered above .",
    "again , there is sensitive dependence on @xmath22 , although not as much as in @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath22 decreases , more soft partons are generated .",
    "the increase of @xmath116 enhances @xmath15 production , and thus suppresses the @xmath13 ratio .",
    "the dominance of proton production makes the charged hadron spectrum insensitive to the change in the pion sector .",
    "but the ratio manifests the pion yield directly .",
    "currently , the data on the @xmath13 ratio is still unavailable for @xmath1 gev .",
    "since @xmath22 depends sensitively on @xmath130 , the ratio may be quite different from that determined at 200 gev @xcite . to have the ratio exceeding 1 is a definitive signature of recombination at work .",
    "the verification of our results will give support to our approach of accounting for hadrons produced up to @xmath146 gev / c at @xmath147 in the absence of hard scattering .",
    "we note that the two lines in fig .",
    "7 are nearly straight , since both @xmath14 and @xmath15 distributions are mainly exponential , as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) , except for the prefactor involving @xmath3 for the proton .",
    "we therefore expect the measured ratio to be essentially linearly rising in fig .",
    "but more importantly in the first place is whether the ratio exceeds 1 for @xmath148 gev / c .",
    "our concern should first be whether the regeneration of soft partons and the suppression of hard partons are the major aspects of physics that we have captured in this treatment . the precise  dependence of @xmath149 , i.e. , whether it is linear or not , is of secondary importance at this point .",
    "similarly , we expect the data to show constancy of @xmath26 for the range of  studied .",
    "we have extended the study of particle production in the fr and tfr to include the regeneration of soft partons due to momentum degradation and to consider also the determination of the @xmath3 distributions .",
    "we have shown that the data of brahms for forward production can be reproduced for all @xmath3 , when suitable values for the degradation parameter are obtained by fitting the @xmath0 ratio .",
    "the consequence is that large @xmath13 ratio must follow .",
    "the hadronization process is recombination and the @xmath3 dependence is exponential , reflecting the thermal origin of the partons .",
    "we predict that the exponential behavior will continue to higher @xmath3 even beyond the boundary separating fr and tfr .",
    "the production of protons is far more efficient than the production of pions .",
    "that is not surprising since it is consistent with the result already obtained in @xcite due to the scarcity of antiquarks in the fr and tfr . here",
    ", the @xmath3 dependence of the proton - to - pion ratio , @xmath149 , is shown to be linearly rising above @xmath150 gev / c and can become greater than 2 above @xmath146 gev / c .",
    "any model based on fragmentation , whether the transverse momentum is acquired through initial - state interaction or hard scattering , would necessarily lead to the ratio @xmath151 , by virtue of the nature of the fragmentation functions .",
    "in contrast , @xmath26 would be around 1 if gluon fragmentation dominates , and be @xmath152 if the fragmentation of valence quarks dominates , so @xmath26 is not the best discriminator between recombination and fragmentation .",
    "no shower partons are involved in the recombination process because hard partons are suppressed in the forward region .",
    "that is supported by the absence of power - law behavior in the @xmath3 dependence of the data . without hard partons",
    "there are no jets , yet there are high-@xmath3 particles , which are produced by the recombination of thermal partons only .",
    "thus there can be no jet structure associated with any hadron at any @xmath3 .",
    "that is , for a particle ( most likely proton ) detected at , say , @xmath146 gev / c , and treated as a trigger particle , there should be no associated particles distinguishable from the background .",
