    "the last seven years have been a very exciting time for string theory . a new understanding of nonperturbative features of string theory , such as d - branes ,",
    "has led to exciting new developments relating string theory to physically interesting systems such as black holes and supersymmetric gauge field theories , as well as to a new understanding of the relationship between yang - mills theories and quantum theories of gravity .    despite remarkable progress in these directions , however , a consistent nonperturbative background - independent formulation of string theory is still lacking .",
    "this situation makes it impossible at this point , even in principle , to directly address cosmological questions using string theory .",
    "string field theory is a nonperturbative approach to string theory which holds some promise towards providing a background - independent definition of the theory .",
    "these lecture notes give an introduction to string field theory and review some recent work which incorporates d - branes into the framework of string field theory .",
    "this work shows that string field theory is a sufficiently robust framework that distinct string backgrounds can arise as disconnected solutions of the theory , at least for open strings .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this success can be replicated in the closed string sector .    in this section",
    "we review briefly the situation in string theory as a whole , and summarize the goals of this set of lectures . in section 2",
    "we review some basic aspects of d - branes . in section 3",
    ", we describe a particular d - brane configuration which exhibits a tachyonic instability .",
    "this tachyon can be seen in the low - energy super yang - mills description of the d - brane geometry .",
    "this field theory tachyon provides a simple model which embodies much of the physics of the more complicated string field theory tachyon discussed in the later lectures . in section 4",
    "we give an introduction to witten s cubic bosonic open string field theory and summarize the conjectures made by sen in 1999 , which suggested that the tachyonic instability of the open bosonic string can be interpreted in terms of an unstable space - filling d - brane , and that this system can be analytically described through open string field theory .",
    "section 5 gives a more detailed analytic description of witten s cubic string field theory . in section 6",
    "we summarize evidence from string field theory for sen s conjectures .",
    "section 7 contains a brief review of some more recent developments .",
    "section 8 contains concluding remarks and lists some open problems .",
    "much new work has been done in this area since these lectures were presented at valdivia in january 2002 . except for a few references to more recent developments in footnotes and in the last two sections , these lecture notes primarily cover work done before january 2002 .",
    "previous articles reviewing related work include those of ohmori @xcite , de smet @xcite , and arefeva _ et al .",
    "an expanded set of lecture notes , based on lectures given by the author and barton zwiebach at tasi 01 , will appear in @xcite ; the larger set of notes will include further details on a number of topics .      to understand the significance of developments over the last seven years , it is useful to recall the situation of string theory as it was in early 1995 . at that time",
    "it was clearly understood that there were 5 distinct ways in which a supersymmetric closed string could be quantized to give a microscopic definition of a theory of quantum gravity in ten dimensions .",
    "each of these approaches to quantizing the string gives a set of rules for calculating scattering amplitudes between on - shell string states which describe gravitational quanta as well as an infinite family of massive particles in a ten - dimensional spacetime .",
    "these five string theories are known as the type iia , iib , i , heterotic @xmath0 , and heterotic @xmath1 superstring theories .",
    "while these string theories give perturbative descriptions of quantum gravity , in 1995 there was little understanding of nonperturbative aspects of these theories .    in the years between 1995 and 2000",
    ", several new ideas dramatically transformed our understanding of string theory .",
    "we now briefly summarize these ideas and mention some aspects of these developments relevant to the main topic of these lectures .",
    "* dualities : * the five different perturbative formulations of superstring theory are all related to one another through duality symmetries @xcite , whereby the degrees of freedom in one theory can be described through a duality transformation in terms of the degrees of freedom of another theory .",
    "some of these duality symmetries are nonperturbative , in the sense that the string coupling @xmath2 in one theory is related to the inverse string coupling @xmath3 in a dual theory .",
    "the web of dualities relating the different theories gives a picture in which , rather than describing five distinct possibilities for a fundamental theory , each of the perturbative superstring theories appears to be a particular perturbative limit of some other , as yet unknown , underlying theoretical structure .",
    "* m - theory : * in addition to the five perturbative string theories , the web of dualities also seems to include a limit which describes a quantum theory of gravity in eleven dimensions .",
    "this new theory has been dubbed `` m - theory '' .",
    "although no covariant definition for m - theory has been given , this theory can be related to type iia and heterotic @xmath1 string theories through compactification on a circle @xmath4 and the space @xmath5 respectively @xcite . for example , in relating to the type iia theory , the compactification radius @xmath6 of m - theory becomes the product @xmath7 of the string coupling and string length in the 10d iia theory .",
    "thus , m - theory in flat space , which arises in the limit @xmath8 , can be thought of as the strong coupling limit of type iia string theory .",
    "it is also suspected that m - theory may be describable as a quantum theory of membranes in 11 dimensions @xcite , although a covariant formulation of such a theory is still lacking .    * branes : * in addition to strings , all five superstring theories , as well as m - theory , contain extended objects of higher dimensionality known as `` branes '' .",
    "m - theory has m2-branes and m5-branes , which have two and five dimensions of spatial extent ( whereas a string has one ) .",
    "the different superstring theories each have different complements of d - branes as well as the fundamental string and neveu - schwarz 5-brane ; in particular , the iia / iib superstring theories contain d - branes of all even / odd dimensions .",
    "the branes of one theory can be related to the branes of another through the duality transformations mentioned above . through an appropriate sequence of dualities",
    ", any brane can be mapped to any other brane , including the string itself .",
    "this suggests that none of these objects are really any more fundamental than any others ; this idea is known as `` brane democracy '' .    *",
    "m(atrix ) theory and ads / cft : * one of the most remarkable results of the developments just mentioned is the realization that in certain space - time backgrounds , m - theory and string theory can be completely described through simple supersymmetric quantum mechanics and field theory models related to the low - energy description of systems of branes .",
    "the m(atrix ) model of m - theory is a simple supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics which is believed to capture all of the physics of m - theory in asymptotically flat spacetime ( in light - cone coordinates ) .",
    "a closely related set of higher - dimensional supersymmetric yang - mills theories are related to string theory in backgrounds described by the product of anti - de sitter space and a sphere through the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "it is believed that these models of m - theory and string theory give true nonperturbative descriptions of quantum gravity in space - time backgrounds which have the asymptotic geometry relevant to each model . for reviews of m(atrix )",
    "theory and ads / cft , see @xcite .",
    "the set of ideas just summarized have greatly increased our understanding of nonperturbative aspects of string theory . in particular , through m(atrix ) theory and the ads / cft correspondences we now have nonperturbative definitions of m - theory and string theory in certain asymptotic space - time backgrounds which could , in principle , be used to calculate any local result in quantum gravity .",
    "while these new insights are very powerful , however , we are still lacking a truly background - independent formulation of string theory .",
    "the goal of these lectures is to describe progress towards a nonperturbative background - independent formulation of string theory .",
    "such a formulation is needed to address fundamental questions such as : what is string theory / m - theory ?",
    "how is the vacuum of string theory selected ?",
    "i.e. _ , why can the observable low - energy universe be accurately described by the standard model of particle physics in four space - time dimensions with an apparently small but nonzero positive cosmological constant ? ) , and other questions of a cosmological nature . obviously , aspiring to address these questions is an ambitious undertaking , but we believe that attaining a better understanding of string field theory is a useful step in this direction .",
    "more concretely , in these lectures we will describe recent progress on open string field theory",
    ". it may be useful here to recall some basic aspects of open and closed strings and the relationship between them .",
    "closed strings , which are topologically equivalent to a circle @xmath4 , give rise upon quantization to a massless set of spacetime fields associated with the graviton @xmath9 , the dilaton @xmath10 , and the antisymmetric two - form @xmath11 , as well as an infinite family of massive fields . for",
    "the supersymmetric closed string , further massless fields associated with the graviton supermultiplet appear  these are the ramond - ramond @xmath12-form fields @xmath13 and the gravitini @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the quantum theory of closed strings is naturally associated with a theory of gravity in space - time . on the other hand , open strings , which are topologically equivalent to an interval @xmath15 $ ] , give rise under quantization to a massless gauge field @xmath16 in space - time .",
    "the supersymmetric open string also has a massless gaugino field @xmath17 .",
    "it is now understood that generally open strings should be thought of as ending on a dirichlet @xmath12-brane ( d@xmath12-brane ) , and that the massless open string fields describe the fluctuations of the d - brane and the gauge field living on the world - volume of the d - brane .",
    "it may seem , therefore , that open and closed strings are quite distinct , and describe disjoint aspects of the physics in a fixed background space - time containing some family of d - branes . at tree level ,",
    "the closed strings indeed describe gravitational physics in the bulk space - time , while the open strings describe the d - brane dynamics . at the quantum level ,",
    "however , the physics of open and closed strings are deeply connected .",
    "indeed , historically open strings were discovered first through the form of their scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "looking at one - loop processes for open strings led to the first discovery of closed strings , which appeared as _",
    "poles _ in nonplanar one - loop open string diagrams @xcite .",
    "the fact that open string diagrams naturally contain closed string intermediate states indicates that in some sense all closed string interactions are implicitly defined through the complete set of open string diagrams .",
    "this connection underlies many of the important recent developments in string theory .",
    "in particular , the m(atrix ) theory and ads / cft correspondences between gauge theories and quantum gravity are essentially limits in which closed string physics in a fixed space - time background is captured by a simple limiting yang - mills description of an open string theory on a family of branes ( d0-branes for m(atrix ) theory , d3-branes for the cft describing ads@xmath18 , etc . )    the fact that , in certain fixed space - time backgrounds , quantum gravity theories can be encoded in terms of open string degrees of freedom through the m(atrix ) and ads / cft correspondences leads to the question of how a global change of the space - time background would appear in the quantum field theory describing the appropriate limit of the open string model in question .",
    "if such a change of background could be described in the context of m(atrix ) theory or ads / cft , it would indicate that these models could be generalized to a background - independent framework .",
    "unfortunately , however , such a change in the background involves adding nonrenormalizable interactions to the field theories in question . at this point in time",
    "we do not have the technology to understand generically how a sensible quantum field theory can be described when an infinite number of nonrenormalizable interaction terms are added to the lagrangian .",
    "one example of a special case where this can be done is the addition of a constant background @xmath19 field in space - time . in the associated yang - mills theory , such as that on a system of @xmath20 d3-branes in the case of the simplest ads / cft correspondence ,",
    "this change in the background field corresponds to replacing products of open string fields with a noncommutative star - product .",
    "the resulting theory is a noncommutative yang - mills theory .",
    "such noncommutative theories are the only well - understood example of a situation where adding an infinite number of apparently nonrenormalizable terms to a field theory action leads to a sensible modification of quantum field theory ( for a review of noncommutative field theory and its connection to string theory , see @xcite ) .",
    "string field theory is a nonperturbative formulation in target space of an interacting string theory , in which the infinite family of fields associated with string excitations are described by a space - time field theory action . for open strings ,",
    "this field theory is a natural extension of the low - energy yang - mills action describing a system of d - branes , where the entire hierarchy of massive string fields is included in addition to the massless gauge field on the d - brane .",
    "integrating out all the massive fields from the string field theory action gives rise to a nonabelian born - infeld action for the d - branes , including an infinite set of higher - order terms arising from string theory corrections to the simple yang - mills action .",
    "like the case of noncommutative field theory discussed above , the new terms appearing in this action are apparently nonrenormalizable , but the combination of terms must work together to form a sensible theory .    in the 1980 s , a great deal of work was done on formulating string field theory for open and closed , bosonic and supersymmetric string theories .",
    "most of these string field theories are quite complicated . for the open bosonic string",
    ", however , witten @xcite constructed an extremely elegant string field theory based on the chern - simons action .",
    "this cubic bosonic open string field theory ( osft ) is the primary focus of the work described in these lectures .",
    "although witten s osft can be described in a simple abstract language , practical computations with this theory rapidly become extremely complicated . despite a substantial amount of work on this theory ,",
    "little insight was gained in the 1980 s regarding how this theory could be used to go beyond standard perturbative string methods .",
    "work on this subject stalled out in the late 80 s , and little further attention was paid to osft until several years ago .",
    "one simple feature of the 26-dimensional bosonic string has been problematic since the early days of string theory : both the open and closed bosonic strings have tachyons in their spectra , indicating that the usual perturbative vacua used for these theories are unstable . in 1999 , ashoke sen had a remarkable insight into the nature of the open bosonic string tachyon @xcite .",
    "he observed that the open bosonic string should be thought of as ending on a space - filling d25-brane .",
    "he pointed out that this d - brane is unstable in the bosonic theory , as it does not carry any conserved charge , and he suggested that the open bosonic string tachyon should be interpreted as the instability mode of the d25-brane .",
    "this led him to conjecture that witten s open string field theory could be used to precisely determine a new vacuum for the open string , namely one in which the d25-brane is annihilated through condensation of the tachyonic unstable mode .",
    "sen made several precise conjectures regarding the details of the string field theory description of this new open string vacuum .",
    "as we describe in these lectures , there is now overwhelming evidence that sen s picture is correct , demonstrating that string field theory accurately describes the nonperturbative physics of d - branes .",
    "this new nonperturbative application of string field theory has sparked a new wave of work on witten s cubic open string field theory , revealing many remarkable new structures .",
    "in particular , string field theory now provides a concrete framework in which disconnected string backgrounds can emerge from the equations of motion of a single underlying theory .",
    "although so far this can only be shown explicitly in the open string context , this work paves the way for a deeper understanding of background - independence in quantum theories of gravity .",
    "in this section we briefly review some basic features of d - branes .",
    "the concepts developed here will be useful in describing tachyonic d - brane configurations in the following section . for more detailed reviews of d - branes , see @xcite .",
    "d - branes can be understood in two ways : _ a _ ) as extended extremal black brane solutions of supergravity carrying conserved charges , and _",
    "b _ ) as hypersurfaces on which strings have dirichlet boundary conditions .    _ a _ ) the ten - dimensional type iia and iib supergravity theories each have a set of @xmath21-form fields @xmath22 in the supergraviton multiplet , with @xmath12 even / odd for type iia / iib supergravity .",
    "these are the ramond - ramond fields in the massless superstring spectrum . for each of these @xmath21-form fields ,",
    "there is a solution of the supergravity field equations which has @xmath21-dimensional lorentz invariance , and which has the form of an extremal black hole solution in the orthogonal @xmath23 space directions plus time ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "these `` black @xmath12-brane '' solutions carry charge under the r - r fields @xmath24 , and are bps states in the supergravity theory , preserving half the supersymmetries of the theory .    _ b _ ) in type iia and iib string theory , it is possible to consider open strings with dirichlet boundary conditions on some number @xmath23 of the spatial coordinates @xmath25 .",
    "the locus of points defined by such dirichlet boundary conditions defines a @xmath21-dimensional hypersurface @xmath26 in the ten - dimensional spacetime .",
    "when @xmath12 is even / odd in type iia / iib string theory , the spectrum of the resulting quantum open string theory contains a massless set of fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "these fields can be associated with a gauge field living on the hypersurface @xmath26 , and a set of degrees of freedom describing the transverse fluctuations of this hypersurface in spacetime .",
    "thus , the quantum fluctuations of the open string describe a fluctuating @xmath21-dimensional hypersurface in spacetime  a dirichlet - brane , or `` d - brane '' .    the remarkable insight of polchinski in 1995 @xcite was the observation that dirichlet - branes carry ramond - ramond charges , and therefore should be described in the low - energy supergravity limit of string theory by precisely the black @xmath12-branes discussed in _ a _ ) .",
    "this connection between the string and supergravity descriptions of these nonperturbative objects paved the way to a dramatic series of new developments in string theory , including connections between string theory and supersymmetric gauge theories , string constructions of black holes , and new approaches to string phenomenology .      in this subsection",
    "we briefly review the low - energy super yang - mills description of the dynamics of one or more d - branes .",
    "as discussed in the previous subsection , the massless open string modes on a d@xmath12-brane in type iia or iib superstring theory describe a @xmath29-component gauge field @xmath30 , @xmath23 transverse scalar fields @xmath31 , and a set of massless fermionic gaugino fields .",
    "the scalar fields @xmath31 describe small fluctuations of the d - brane around a flat hypersurface .",
    "if the d - brane geometry is sufficiently far from flat , it is useful to describe the d - brane configuration by a general embedding @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are @xmath34 coordinates on the d@xmath12-brane world - volume @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are ten functions giving a map from @xmath35 into the space - time manifold @xmath37 . just as the einstein equations governing the geometry of spacetime arise from the condition that the one - loop contribution to the closed string beta function vanish , a set of equations of motion for a general d@xmath12-brane geometry and associated world - volume gauge field can be derived from a calculation of the one - loop open string beta function @xcite .",
    "these equations of motion arise from the classical born - infeld action @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath19 and @xmath10 are the pullbacks of the 10d metric , antisymmetric tensor and dilaton to the d - brane world - volume , while @xmath40 is the field strength of the world - volume @xmath41 gauge field @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 represents a set of chern - simons terms which will be discussed in the following subsection .",
    "this action can be verified by a perturbative string calculation @xcite , which also gives a precise expression for the brane tension @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the string coupling , equal to the exponential of the dilaton expectation value .",
    "a particular limit of the born - infeld action ( [ eq : dbi ] ) is useful for describing many low - energy aspects of d - brane dynamics .",
    "take the background space - time @xmath46 to be flat , and all other supergravity fields ( @xmath47 ) to vanish .",
    "we then assume that the d - brane is approximately flat , and is close to the hypersurface @xmath48 , so that we may make the static gauge choice @xmath49 .",
    "we furthermore assume that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are small and of the same order . in this limit",
    ", the action ( [ eq : dbi ] ) can be expanded as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the @xmath12-brane world - volume and the coupling @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 including fermionic terms , the second term in ( [ eq : action - expansion ] ) is simply the dimensional reduction to @xmath21 dimensions of the 10d @xmath56 super yang - mills action @xmath57 where for @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the world - volume u(1 ) field strength , and for @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( setting @xmath62 ) .    when multiple d@xmath12-branes are present , the d - brane action is modified in a fairly simple fashion @xcite .",
    "consider a system of @xmath20 coincident d - branes .",
    "for every pair of branes @xmath63 there is a set of massless fields @xmath64 associated with strings stretching from the @xmath65th brane to the @xmath66th brane ; the indices @xmath67 are known as chan - paton indices .",
    "treating the fields ( [ eq : nonabelian - fields ] ) as matrices , the analogue for multiple branes of the born - infeld action ( [ eq : dbi ] ) takes the form @xmath68 this action is known as the nonabelian born - infeld action ( nbi ) . in order to give a rigorous definition to the nonabelian born - infeld action , it is necessary to resolve ordering ambiguities in the expression ( [ eq : nbi ] ) .",
    "since the spacetime coordinates @xmath31 associated with the d - brane positions in space - time become themselves matrix - valued , even evaluating the pullbacks @xmath69 involves resolving ordering issues .",
    "much work has been done recently to resolve these ordering ambiguities ( see @xcite for some recent papers in this direction which contain further references to the literature ) , but there is still no consistent definition of the nonabelian born - infeld theory ( [ eq : nbi ] ) which is valid to all orders .",
    "the nonabelian born - infeld action ( [ eq : nbi ] ) becomes much simpler in the low - energy limit when the background space - time is flat . in the same limit discussed above for the single d - brane , where we find a low - energy limit giving the u(1 ) super yang - mills theory in @xmath34 dimensions",
    ", the inclusion of multiple d - branes simply leads in the low - energy limit to the nonabelian u(n ) super yang - mills action in @xmath70 dimensions .",
    "this action is the dimensional reduction of the 10d u(n ) super yang - mills action ( analogous to ( [ eq : sym1 ] ) , but with an overall trace ) to @xmath34 dimensions . in this reduction , as before , for @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the world - volume u(1 ) field strength , and for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , where now @xmath71 and @xmath59 are @xmath72 matrices . we furthermore have , for @xmath73 , @xmath74 $ ] in the dimensional reduction .    the low - energy description of a system of @xmath20 coincident flat d - branes is thus given by @xmath75 super yang - mills theory in the appropriate dimension .",
    "this connection between d - brane actions in string theory and super yang - mills theory has led to many new developments , including new insights into supersymmetric field theories , the m(atrix ) theory and ads / cft correspondences , and brane world scenarios .      in this subsection",
    "we describe a remarkable feature of d - brane systems , namely a mechanism by which one or more d - branes of a fixed dimension can be used to construct additional d - branes of higher or lower dimension .    in our discussion of the d - brane action ( [ eq : dbi ] ) above",
    ", we mentioned a group of terms @xmath43 which we did not describe explicitly . for a single d@xmath12-brane",

    "for example , on a d@xmath12-brane , there is a coupling of the form @xmath81 this coupling implies that the u(1 ) field strength on the d@xmath12-brane couples to the r - r field associated with @xmath82-branes .",

    "the fact that the trace of ( [ eq : up - charge ] ) vanishes for finite sized matrices corresponds to the fact that the net d@xmath12-brane charge of a finite - size brane configuration in flat spacetime vanishes .",

    "the restriction of the brane to the desired locus of points can be seen from the relation @xmath92 .",
    "we conclude our discussion of d - branes with a brief description of t - duality .",
    "t - duality is a perturbative symmetry which relates the type iia and type iib string theories .",
    "this duality symmetry was in fact crucial in the original discovery of d - branes @xcite .",
    "a more detailed discussion of t - duality can be found in the textbook by polchinski @xcite . using t - duality , we construct an explicit example of a brane within a brane encoded in super yang - mills theory , illustrating the ideas of the previous subsection .",

    "t - duality is the statement that this theory is precisely equivalent , at the perturbative level , to type iib string theory on the spacetime @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is a circle of radius @xmath98 .",
    "t - duality is most easily understood in terms of closed strings , where it amounts to an exchange of winding and momentum modes of the string .",

    "we can summarize the relevant mappings under t - duality in the following table    [ cols=\">,^ , > \" , ]     these numerical calculations indicate that level truncation of string field theory leads to a good systematic approximation scheme for computing the nonperturbative tachyon vacuum . up to level 12 , at level ( 14 , 42 ) the energy becomes @xmath103 , and that the energy continues to decrease , reaching @xmath104 at level ( 18 , 54 ) . in @xcite",

    "this was done numerically up to level @xmath112 in @xcite@xmath113 . at each level , the tachyon effective potential smoothly interpolates between the perturbative vacuum and the nonperturbative vacuum near @xmath114 .",
    "for example , the tachyon effective potential at level ( 2 , 6 ) is graphed in figure  [ f : potential ] . in all level truncations other than ( 0 , 0 ) and ( 2 , 4 ) , the tachyon effective potential has two branch point singularities at which the continuous solution for the other fields breaks down",
    "; for the level ( 2 , 6 ) truncation , these branch points occur at @xmath115 and @xmath116 ; the lower branch point is denoted by a solid circle in figure  [ f : potential ] . as a result of these branch points ,",

    "it was demonstrated numerically that the branch points in the tachyon effective potential arise because the trajectory in field space associated with this potential encounters the boundary of the region of feynman - siegel gauge validity . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "feynman - siegel gauge is only valid in a finite - size region around the perturbative vacuum .",
    "it seems almost to be a fortunate accident that the nonperturbative vacuum lies within the region of validity of this gauge choice .",
    "it is also worth mentioning here that in the `` background - independent '' formulation of sft , the tachyon potential can be computed exactly @xcite . in this formulation",
    ", there is no branch point in the effective potential , which is unbounded below for negative values of the tachyon . on the other hand ,",
    "the nontrivial vacuum in the background - independent approach arises only as the tachyon field goes to infinity , so it is harder to study the physics of the stable vacuum from this point of view .",
    "another interesting perspective on the tachyon effective potential is found by performing a perturbative computation of the coefficients in this effective potential in the level - truncated theory .",

    "unfortunately , we can not precisely determine whether the poles we find in level truncation are due to exact states , as the level - truncation procedure breaks the condition @xmath142 .",

    "generalizing this analysis to higher levels , they found at levels 5 , 7 , and 9 , a deviation from exactness of @xmath173 and @xmath174 respectively . at level 9 , for example",
    ", the identity field has 118 components , and there are only 43 gauge parameters , so this is a highly nontrivial check on the exactness of the identity . like the results of @xcite , these results strongly support the conclusion that the cohomology of the theory is trivial in the stable vacuum . in this case",
    ", the result applies to fields of all spins and all ghost numbers .",
    "given that the witten string field theory seems to have a classical solution with no perturbative open string excitations , in accordance with sen s conjectures , it is quite interesting to ask what the physics of the vacuum string field theory ( [ eq : vsft - action ] ) should describe .",
    "one natural assumption might be that this theory should include closed string states in its quantum spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , addressing this question requires performing calculations in the quantum theory around the stable vacuum .",
    "such calculations are quite difficult ( although progress in this direction has been made in the @xmath12-adic version of the theory @xcite ) . even in the perturbative vacuum , it is difficult to systematically study closed strings in the quantum string from theory .",
    "we discuss the question again briefly in the final section .",
    "in this section we review briefly some further developments which we do not have time to explore in great detail in these lectures . in subsection 7.1",
    "we discuss the pure ghost brst operator ansatz of rsz ( rastelli , sen , and zwiebach ) for vacuum string field theory . in subsection 7.2",
    "we discuss `` sliver '' states and related states ; these states are projectors in the sft star algebra , and are closely related to d - branes in the rsz vsft model .",
    "these topics will be discussed in further detail in @xcite      in @xcite , rastelli , sen , and zwiebach made an intriguing proposal regarding the form of witten s string field theory around the stable tachyon vacuum .",
    "since the exact form of the brst operator @xmath128 given by ( [ eq : vsft - q ] ) is not known analytically , and is difficult to work with numerically , these authors suggested that it might be possible to `` guess '' an appropriate form for this operator ( after suitable field redefinition ) , using the properties expected of the brst operator in any vacuum .",
    "they suggested a simple class of brst operators @xmath175 which satisfy the properties ( a - c ) described in section 4.2 ( actually , they impose the slightly weaker but still sufficient condition @xmath176 instead of condition ( b ) ) .",
    "in particular , they propose that after a field redefinition , the brst operator of the string field theory in the classically stable vacuum should be an operator @xmath175 expressable purely in terms of ghost operators .",
    "for example , the simplest operator in the class they suggest is @xmath177 , which clearly satisfies @xmath178 , and which also satisfies condition ( c ) and the weaker form of condition ( b ) mentioned above .",
    "the rsz model of vacuum string field theory has a number of attractive features .",
    "* this model satisfies all the axioms of string field theory , and has a brst operator with vanishing cohomology . * in the rsz model , the equation of motion factorizes into the usual equation of motion @xmath179 for the ghost part of the field , and a projection equation @xmath180 for the matter part of the field , where the full string field is given by @xmath181 thus , finding a solution of the equation of motion reduces to the problem of solving the equation of motion in the ghost sector and identifying projection operators in the string field star algebra .",
    "it was also recently shown @xcite that by taking the brst operator @xmath175 to be given by a ghost insertion localized at the string midpoint , the ghost equation also has essentially the form of the projection equation .",
    "thus , this seems to be a very natural choice for the brst operator of the rsz model . * a number of projection operators have been identified in the string field star algebra .",
    "these projection operators have many of the properties desired of d - branes .",
    "we will briefly review some aspects of these projection operators in the next subsection . * given the projection operators just mentioned , the ratio of tensions between d - branes of different dimensionality can be computed and has the correct value @xcite .    despite the successes of the rsz model , there are some difficult technical aspects of this picture .",
    "first , it seems very difficult to actually prove that this model is related to the vsft around the stable vacuum in the witten model , not least because we lack any analytic control over the witten theory .",
    "second , the rsz model seems to have a somewhat singular structure in several respects .",
    "formally , the action on any well - behaved fock space state satisfying the equation of motion will vanish @xcite .",
    "further , the natural solutions of the projection equation corresponding to the matter sector of the equation of motion have rather singular properties @xcite .",
    "some of these singular properties are related to the fact that some of the physics in the rsz model seems to have been `` pushed '' into the midpoint of the string . in the witten model ,",
    "the condition that , for example , @xmath182 involves a fairly subtle anomaly cancellation between the matter and ghost sectors at the midpoint . in the rsz model ,",
    "the matter and ghost sectors are essentially decoupled , so that the theory seems to have separate singularities in each sector , which cancel when the sectors are combined .",
    "these are all indications of a theory with problematic singularities .",
    "while the witten theory seems to be free of singularities of this type , it remains to be seen whether resolving the singularities of the rsz model or finding an analytic approach to the witten theory will be a more difficult problem to solve .      from the point of view of the rsz model of vsft",
    "just discussed , projection operators in the matter sector of the star algebra play a crucial role in constructing solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "such projection operators may also be useful in understanding solutions in the original witten theory .",
    "quite a bit of work has been done on constructing and analyzing projectors in the star algebra since the rsz model was originally proposed . without going into the technical details ,",
    "we now briefly review some of the important features of matter projectors .",
    "the first matter projector which was explicitly constructed is the `` sliver '' state .",
    "this state was identified in conformal field theory in @xcite , and then constructed explicitly using matter oscillators in @xcite .",
    "the sliver state takes the form of a squeezed state @xmath183| 0 \\rangle \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : sliver - squeezed}\\ ] ] by requiring that such a state satisfy the projection equation @xmath184 , and by making some further assumptions about the nature of the state , an explicit formula for the matrix @xmath185 was found in @xcite .",
    "projectors like the sliver have many properties which are reminiscent of d - branes .",
    "this relationship between projection operators and d - branes is familiar from noncommutative field theory , where projectors also play the role of d - brane solitons @xcite ( for a review of noncommutative field theory , see @xcite ) . in the rsz model , by tensoring an arbitrary matter projector with a fixed ghost state satisfying the ghost equation of motion ( [ eq : eom - ghosts ] ) , states corresponding to an arbitrary configuration of d - branes can be constructed .",
    "particular projectors like the sliver can be constructed which are localized in any number of space - time dimensions , corresponding to the codimension of a d - brane . under gauge transformations",
    ", a rank 1 projector can be rotated into an orthogonal rank 1 projector , so that configurations containing multiple branes can be constructed as higher rank projectors formed from the sum of orthogonal rank one projectors @xcite .",
    "this gives a very suggestive picture of how arbitrary d - brane configurations can be constructed in string field theory . while this picture is quite compelling , however , there are a number of technical obstacles which make this still a somewhat incomplete story . as mentioned above , in the rsz model ,",
    "many singularities appear due to the separation of the matter and ghost sectors . in the context of the matter projectors , these singularities manifest as singular properties of the projectors .",
    "for example , the sliver state described above has a matrix @xmath185 which has eigenvalues of @xmath186 for any dimension of d - brane @xcite .",
    "such eigenvalues cause the state to be nonnormalizable elements of the matter fock space . in the dirichlet directions ,",
    "this lack of normalizability occurs because the state is essentially localized to a point and is analogous to a delta function . in the neumann directions , the singularity manifests as a `` breaking '' of the strings composing the d - brane , so that the functional describing the projector state is a product of a function of the string configurations on the left and right halves of the string , with no connection mediated through the midpoint .",
    "these geometric singularities seem to be generic features of matter projectors , not just of the sliver state @xcite .",
    "these singular geometric features are one of the things which makes direct calculation in the rsz model somewhat complicated , as all these singularities must be sensibly regulated",
    ". these singularities do not seem to appear in the witten theory , where the brst operator and numerically calculated solutions seem to behave smoothly at the string midpoint . on the other hand",
    ", it may be that further study of the matter projection operators and their cousins in the ghost sector which satisfy ( [ eq : eom - ghosts ] ) will lead to analytic progress on the witten theory .",
    "the work described in these lectures has brought our understanding of string field theory to a new level .",
    "we now have fairly conclusive evidence that open string field theory can successfully describe distinct vacua with very different geometrical properties , which are not related to one another through a marginal deformation . the resulting picture , in which a complicated set of degrees of freedom defined primarily through an algebraic structure , can produce different geometrical backgrounds at different solutions of the equations of motion , represents an important step beyond perturbative string theory .",
    "such an approach , where different backgrounds with different low - energy degrees of freedom arise from a single underlying formalism , is clearly necessary to discuss questions of a cosmological nature in string theory .",
    "it is clearly essential , however , to generalize from the work described here in which the theory describes distinct _ open _ string backgrounds , to a formalism where different _ closed _ string backgrounds appear as solutions to an equation of motion for a single set of degrees of freedom .",
    "clearly , it is an important goal to have a formulation of string / m - theory in which all the currently understood vacua can arise in terms of a single well - defined set of degrees of freedom .",
    "it is not yet clear , however , how far it is possible go towards this goal using the current formulations of string field theory",
    ". it may be that the correct lesson to take from the work described here is simply that there _ are _ nonperturbative formulations in which distinct vacua can be brought together as solutions of a single classical theory , and that one should search for some deeper fundamental algebraic formulation where geometry , and even the dimension of space - time emerge from the fundamental degrees of freedom in the same way that d - brane geometry emerges from the degrees of freedom of witten s open string field theory . a more conservative scenario",
    ", however , might be that we could perhaps use the current framework of string field theory , or some limited refinement thereof , to achieve this goal of providing a universal nonperturbative definition of string theory and m - theory .",
    "following this latter scenario , we propose here a series of questions aimed at continuing the recent developments in open string field theory as far as possible towards this ultimate goal .",
    "it is not certain that this research program can be carried to its conclusion , but it will be very interesting to see how far open string field theory can go in reproducing important nonperturbative aspects of string theory .    some open problems :    1 .",
    "the first important unsolved problem in this area is to find an analytic description of the tachyonic vacuum .",
    "despite several years of work on this problem , great success with numerical approximations , and some insight from the rsz vacuum string field theory model , we still have no good analytic understanding of the difference between the d - brane vacuum and the empty vacuum in witten s open cubic string field theory .",
    "it seems almost unbelievable that there is not some elegant analytic solution to this problem .",
    "finding such an analytic solution would almost certainly greatly enhance our understanding of this theory , and would probably lead to other significant advances .",
    "2 .   another interesting and important unsolved problem is to find , either analytically or numerically , a solution of the witten theory describing _ two _ d25-branes . if open string field theory is truly a background - independent theory , at least in the open string sense , it should be just as feasible to go from a vacuum with one d - brane to a vacuum with two d - branes as it is to go from a vacuum with one d - brane to the empty vacuum ( or from the vacuum with two d - branes to the vacuum with one d - brane , which is essentially the same problem as going from one to none ) . despite some work on this problem @xcite ,",
    "there is as yet no evidence that a double d - brane solution exists for the witten theory on a single d - brane .",
    "several approaches which have been tried ( and will be described in more detail in @xcite ) include : _ i _ ) following a positive mass field upward , looking for a stable point ; this method seems to fail because of gauge - fixing problems  the effective potential often develops a singularity before reaching the energy @xmath187 , _ ii _ ) following the intuition of the rsz model and constructing a gauge transform of the original d - brane solution which is @xmath188orthogonal to the original d - brane vacuum .",
    "it can be shown formally that such a state , when added to the original d - brane vacuum gives a new solution with the correct energy for a double d - brane ; unfortunately , however , we have been unable to identify such a state numerically in level truncation .",
    "+ there are several other problems closely related to the double d - brane problem .",
    "one related problem is the problem of studying a d0-brane lump solution from the tachyon field on a d1-brane wrapped on a small circle .",
    "when the circle is sufficiently small , the mass of the d0-brane is larger than that of the wrapped d1-brane . in this case",
    ", it seems much more difficult to construct the d0-brane lump solution than it is when the d0-brane has mass smaller than the d1-brane @xcite .",
    "another possibly related problem is the problem of translating a single d - brane of less than maximal dimension in a transverse direction .",
    "it was shown by sen and zwiebach @xcite ( in a t - dual picture ) that after moving a d - brane a finite distance of order of the string length in a transverse direction , the level - truncated string field theory equations develop a singularity .",
    "thus , in level truncation it does not seem possible to move a d - brane a macroscopic distance in a transverse direction . in this case , a toy model @xcite suggests that the problem is that the infinitesimal marginal parameter for the brane translation ceases to parameterize the marginal trajectory in field space after a finite distance , just as the coordinate @xmath189 ceases to parameterize the circle @xmath190 near @xmath191 .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the breakdown of feynman - siegel gauge along the tachyon potential discussed in section 6.1 .",
    "+ to show that open string field theory is sufficiently general to address arbitrary questions involving different vacua , it is clearly necessary to show that the formalism is powerful enough to describe multiple brane vacua , the d0-brane lump on an arbitrary radius circle , and translated brane vacua .",
    "it is currently unclear whether the obstacles to finding these vacua are conceptual or technical .",
    "it may be that the level - truncation approach is not well - suited to finding these vacua .",
    "if this is true , however , we may need a clearer mathematical formalism for describing the theory .",
    "there is currently some ambiguity in the definition of the theory , in terms of precisely which states are allowed in the string field .",
    "level - truncation in some sense gives a regularization of , and a concrete definition to , the theory . without level truncation , we would need some more definitive mathematical tools for analyzing various features of the theory , such as the other vacua mentioned here .",
    "another open question involves the role that closed strings play in open string field theory . as has been known since the earliest days of the subject , closed strings appear as poles in perturbative open string scattering amplitudes .",
    "this was shown explicitly for witten s sft in @xcite , where it was shown that closed string poles arise in the one - loop 2-point function .",
    "if witten s theory is well - defined as a quantum theory , it would follow from unitarity that the closed string states should also arise in some natural sense as asymptotic states of the quantum open string field theory .",
    "it is currently rather unclear , however , whether , and if so how , this might be realized .",
    "there are subtleties in the quantum formulation of the theory which have never completely been resolved @xcite .",
    "both older sft literature @xcite and recent work @xcite have suggested ways in which closed strings might be incorporated into the open string field theory formalism , but a definitive resolution of this question is still not available .",
    "if it is indeed possible to encode closed string degrees of freedom in some way in the quantum open string field theory , it suggests that one could use the witten formalism in principle to not only compute general closed string scattering amplitudes , but perhaps even to address questions of closed string vacua .",
    "this is clearly an optimistic scenario , but one can imagine that the open string theory might really contain all of closed string physics as well as open string physics .",
    "this scenario is perhaps not so farfetched , as it really represents simply a lifting to the level of string field theory of the ads / cft story , where the massive as well as the massless modes are included .",
    "furthermore , the fact that , as discussed in section 5.5 , the open string diagrams precisely cover the moduli space of riemann surfaces with an arbitrary number of handles ( and at least one boundary ) , suggests that by shrinking the boundaries to closed strings , one might neatly describe all perturbative closed string amplitudes in the open string language . on the other hand",
    ", it seems quite possible that the closed string sector of the theory is encoded in a singular fashion ( like the encoding of the d - brane in the rsz vsft model ) , so that extracting the closed string physics from the open string field theory may involve such complicated manipulations that one is better off directly working with a closed string formalism .",
    "it would certainly be nice to have a clearer picture of how far one can go in this direction purely from the open string point of view .",
    "another obvious , but crucial , question is how this whole story can be generalized to superstrings .",
    "the naive witten cubic superstring field theory has technical problems arising from contact terms between picture - changing operators @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that these problems can be resolved directly in the cubic theory @xcite .",
    "berkovits has also suggested a new non - polynomial string field theory framework which seems to deal successfully with the contact term problem , at least in the ns - ns sector @xcite .",
    "some preliminary work indicates that numerical calculations on the tachyon condensation problem for the open superstring can be carried out in the berkovits model with analogous results to those described here for the bosonic open string , although the results to date for the superstring are much more limited @xcite .",
    "it would be nice to have a more complete picture for the superstring , and some sense of how issues like the closed string question would work in the supersymmetric framework .",
    "perhaps the most important lesson we have learned from the body of work discussed in these lectures is that open string field theory is a consistent framework in which geometrically distinct open string backgrounds can arise as classical solutions of a single theory .",
    "a fundamental outstanding problem in string theory is to find a framework in which different closed string backgrounds arise in a similar fashion from some fixed set of degrees of freedom within a single well - defined theory . in principle , we would hope that all the different closed string backgrounds would arise as solutions of the equations of motion for the fundamental underlying degrees of freedom of string field theory , either by incorporating closed strings into the open string field theory framework as described above , or by working directly in some formulation of closed string field theory .",
    "it is quite challenging to imagine a single set of degrees of freedom which would encode , in different phases , all the possible string backgrounds we are familiar with .",
    "a particularly pressing case is that of m - theory . in principle , a nonperturbative background - independent formulation of type ii string theory should allow one to take the string coupling to infinity in such a way that the fundamental degrees of freedom of the theory are still actually at some finite point in their configuration space in the limit .",
    "this would lead to the vacuum associated with m - theory in flat space - time",
    ". it would be quite remarkable if this can be achieved in the framework of string field theory . given the nontrivial relationship between string fields and low - energy effective degrees of freedom , however , such a result can not be ruled out .",
    "if this picture could be successfully implemented , it would give a very satisfying understanding of how the complicated network of dualities of string and m - theory could be represented in terms of a single underlying set of degrees of freedom .",
    "i would like to thank cecs and the organizers of the school on quantum gravity for their support and hospitality , and for an extremely enjoyable summer school experience .",
