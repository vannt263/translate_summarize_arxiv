    "there is large observational evidence of the presence of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) in the centres of most nearby galaxies  @xcite . the dynamical evidence related to the orbital motion of stars in the cluster surrounding sgr",
    "@xmath7 indicates the presence of a smbh with mass @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the observed correlation between the central black hole masses and the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge of the host galaxies suggests a direct connection between the formation and evolution of galaxies and smbh  @xcite .",
    "the observation of luminous quasars detected at redshifts higher than 6 in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) implies that smbh with masses @xmath9 , which are believed to be the engines of such powerful quasars , were formed within the first billion years after the big bang ( e.g. fan 2006 for a recent review ) .",
    "however , it is still an open question how smbh seeds form and grow to reach such high masses in such a short amount of time  @xcite .",
    "a number of different routes based on stellar dynamical processes , hydrodynamical processes or a combination of both have been suggested ( e.g. volonteri 2010 for a recent review ) .",
    "one of the theoretical scenarios for smbh seed formation is the gravitational collapse of the first generation of stars ( population iii stars ) with masses @xmath10 that are expected to form in halos with virial temperature @xmath11 at @xmath12 where cooling by molecular hydrogen is effective . as a result of the gravitational collapse of such pop iii stars ,",
    "very massive bhs would form and then grow via merger and accretion  @xcite .",
    "another possible scenario proposes that if sufficient primordial gas in massive halos , with mass @xmath13 , is unable to cool below @xmath14 , it may lead to the formation of a supermassive object @xcite , which would eventually collapse to form a smbh .",
    "this route assumes that fragmentation , which depends on efficient cooling , is suppressed , possibly by the presence of sufficiently strong uv radiation , that prevents the formation of molecular hydrogen in an environment with metallicity smaller than a given critical value  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fragmentation may depend on the turbulence present within the inflow of gas , and on the mechanism redistributing its angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "the `` bars - within - bars '' mechanism  @xcite is a self - regulating route to redistribute angular momentum and sustain turbulence such that the inflow of gas can proceed without fragmenting as it collapses even in a metal - enriched environment .",
    "depending on the rate and efficiency of the inflowing mass , there may be different outcomes .",
    "a low rate of mass accumulation would favor the formation of isentropic supermassive stars ( sms ) , with mass @xmath15 , which then would evolve as equilibrium configurations dominated by radiation pressure  @xcite .",
    "a different outcome could result if the accumulation of gas is fast enough so that the outer layers of sms are not thermally relaxed during much of their lifetime , thus having an entropy stratification  @xcite .",
    "a more exotic mechanism that could eventually lead to a sms collapsing into a smbh is the formation and evolution of supermassive dark matter stars ( sdms ) ( spolyar et al 2008 ) .",
    "such stars would be composed primarily of hydrogen and helium with only about @xmath16 of their mass in the form of dark matter , however they would shine due to dark matter annihilation .",
    "it has recently been pointed out that sdmss could reach masses @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "once sdmss run out of their dark matter supply , they experience a contraction phase that increases their baryon density and temperature , leading to an environment where nuclear burning may become important for the subsequent stellar evolution .",
    "if isentropic sms form , their quasi - stationary evolution of cooling and contraction will drive the stars to the onset of a general relativistic gravitational instability leading to their gravitational collapse  @xcite , and possibly also to the formation of a smbh .",
    "the first numerical simulations , within the post - newtonian approximation , of @xcite concluded that for spherical stars with masses greater than @xmath18 thermonuclear reactions have no major effect on the collapse , while less massive stars exploded due to hydrogen burning .",
    "later @xcite performed the first relativistic simulations of the collapse of a sms in spherical symmetry .",
    "they were able to follow the evolution until the formation of a bh , although their investigations did not include any microphysics . @xcite revisited the work of @xcite and performed simulations of non - rotating sms in the range of @xmath19-@xmath18 with post - newtonian corrections and detailed microphysics that took into account an equation of state ( eos ) including electron - positron pairs , and a reaction network describing hydrogen burning by the cno cycle and its break - out via the rapid proton capture ( rp)-process .",
    "they found that sms with zero initial metallicity do not explode , while sms with masses larger than @xmath20 and with metallicity @xmath21 do explode .",
    "more recently @xcite carried out general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of sms adopting a spacetime foliation with outgoing null hypersurfaces to solve the system of einstein and fluid equations .",
    "they performed simulations of spherical sms with masses in the range of @xmath22 using an eos that accounts for contributions from baryonic gases , and in a tabulated form , radiation and electron - positron pairs .",
    "they were able to follow the collapse from the onset of the instability until the point of bh formation , and showed that an apparent horizon ( ah ) enclosing about 25% of the stellar material was formed in all cases when simulations stopped .",
    "@xcite carried out general relativistic numerical simulations in axisymmetry of the collapse of uniformly rotating sms to bhs .",
    "they did not take into account thermonuclear burning , and adopted a @xmath23-law eos , @xmath24 with adiabatic index @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the pressure , @xmath27 the rest - mass density , and @xmath28 the specific internal energy .",
    "although their simulations stopped before the final equilibrium was reached , the bh growth was followed until about 60@xmath29 of the mass had been swallowed by the smbh .",
    "they estimated that about 90@xmath29 of the total mass would end up in the final smbh with a spin parameter of @xmath30 .",
    "the gravitational collapse of differentially rotating sms in three dimensions was investigated by @xcite , who focused on the post - bh evolution , and also on the gravitational wave ( gw ) signal resulting from the newly formed smbh and the surrounding disk .",
    "the gw signal is expected to be emitted in the low frequency lisa band ( @xmath31 hz ) .    despite the progress made ,",
    "the final fate rotating isentropic sms is still unclear . in particular",
    ", it is still an open question for which initial metallicities hydrogen burning by the @xmath32-limited hot cno cycle and its break - out via the @xmath33o@xmath34ne reaction ( rp - process ) can halt the gravitational collapse of rotating sms and generate enough thermal energy to lead to an explosion . to address this issue",
    ", we perform a series of general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with a microphysical eos accounting for contributions from radiation , electron - positron pairs , and baryonic matter , and taking into account the net thermonuclear energy released by the nuclear reactions involved in hydrogen burning through the pp - chain , cold and hot cno cycles and their break - out by the rp - process , and helium burning through the 3-@xmath35 reaction .",
    "the numerical simulations were carried out with the nada code  @xcite , which solves the einstein equations coupled to the general relativistic hydrodynamics equations .",
    "greek indices run from 0 to 3 , latin indices from 1 to 3 , and we adopt the standard convention for the summation over repeated indices . unless otherwise stated we use units in which @xmath36 .",

    "we refer to  @xcite for a more detailed description of the main equations and thorough testing of the code ( namely single bh evolutions , shock tubes , evolutions of both spherical and rotating relativistic stars , gravitational collapse to a bh of a marginally stable spherical star , and simulations of a system formed by a bh surrounded by a self - gravitating torus in equilibrium ) .",
    "we follow the 3 + 1 formulation in which the spacetime is foliated into a set of non - intersecting spacelike hypersurfaces . in this approach",
    ", the line element is written in the following form @xmath37 where @xmath35 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the lapse function , the shift three - vector , and the three - metric , respectively .",
    "the latter is defined by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a timelike unit - normal vector orthogonal to a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "we make use of the bssn formulation  @xcite to solve the einstein equations .",

    "we use the cartoon method @xcite to impose axisymmetry while using cartesian coordinates .",
    "in addition to the bssn spacetime variables ( @xmath56 ) , there are two more quantities left undetermined , the lapse , @xmath35 and the shift vector @xmath57 .",

    ", @xmath64 is the fluid four - velocity and @xmath65 is the covariant derivative with respect to the spacetime metric .",
    "following @xcite , the general relativistic hydrodynamics equations are written in a conservative form in cylindrical coordinates . since the einstein equations are solved only in the @xmath66 plane with cartesian coordinates ( 2d ) , the hydrodynamic equations are rewritten in cartesian coordinates for @xmath66 .",
    "the following definitions for the hydrodynamical variables are used @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the lorentz factor and the specific fluid enthalpy respectively , and @xmath26 is the pressure .",
    "the conserved variables are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further details .",
    "isentropic sms are self - gravitating equilibrium configurations of masses in the range of @xmath77 , which are mainly supported by radiation pressure , while the pressure of electron - positron pairs and of the baryon gas are only minor contributions to the eos .",
    "such configurations are well described by newtonian polytropes with polytropic index @xmath78 ( adiabatic index @xmath25 ) .",
    "the ratio of gas pressure to the total pressure ( @xmath32 ) for spherical sms can be written as  @xcite    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "thus @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "since nuclear burning timescales are too long for @xmath83 , evolution of sms proceeds on the kelvin - helmholtz timescale and is driven by the loss of energy and entropy by radiation as well as loss of angular momentum via mass shedding in the case of rotating configurations .",
    "although corrections due to the nonrelativistic gas of baryons and electrons and general relativistic effects are small , they can not be neglected for the evolution .",
    "firstly , gas corrections raise the adiabatic index slightly above @xmath84    @xmath85    secondly , general relativistic corrections lead to the existence of a maximum for the equilibrium mass as a function of the central density . for spherical sms",
    "this means that for a given mass the star evolves to a critical density beyond which it is dynamically unstable against radial perturbations @xcite :    @xmath86    the onset of the instability also corresponds to a critical value of the adiabatic index @xmath87 , i.e. configurations become unstable when the adiabatic index drops below the critical value    @xmath88    this happens when the stabilizing gas contribution to the eos does not raise the adiabatic index above @xmath84 to compensate for the destabilizing effect of general relativity expressed by the second term on the righ - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ gcri ] ) .",
    "rotation can stabilize configurations against the radial instability .",
    "the stability of rotating sms with uniform rotation was analyzed by @xcite .",
    "they found that stars at the onset of the instability have an equatorial radius @xmath89 , a spin parameter @xmath90 , and a ratio of rotational kinetic energy to the gravitational binding energy of @xmath91 .      to close the system of hydrodynamic equations ( eq .",
    "[ hydro eqs ] ) we need to define the eos .",
    "we follow a treatment which includes separately the baryon contribution on the one hand , and photons and electron - positron pairs contributions , in a tabulated form , on the other hand .",
    "the baryon contribution is given by the analytic expressions for the pressure and specific internal energy    @xmath92    @xmath93    where @xmath94 the universal gas constant , @xmath95 the temperature , @xmath96 the baryon specific internal energy , and @xmath97 is the mean molecular weight due to ions , which can be expressed as a function of the mass fractions of hydrogen ( @xmath98 ) , helium ( @xmath99 ) and heavier elements ( metals ) ( @xmath100 ) as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the average atomic mass of the heavy elements .",
    "we assume that the composition of sms ( approximately that of primordial gas ) has a mass fraction of hydrogen @xmath103 and helium @xmath104 , where the metallity @xmath105 is an initial parameter , typically of the order of @xmath106 ( see table 1 details ) .",
    "thus , for the initial compositions that we consider the mean molecular weight of baryons is @xmath107 ( i.e. corresponding to a molecular weight for both ions and electrons of @xmath108 ) .",
    "effects associated with photons and the creation of electron - positron pairs are taken into account employing a tabulated eos . at temperatures above @xmath109 ,",
    "not all the energy is used to increase the temperature and pressure , but part of the photon energy is used to create the rest - mass of the electron - positron pairs . as a result of pair creation , the adiabatic index of the star decreases , which means that the stability of the star is reduced .",
    "given the specific internal energy , @xmath28 and rest - mass density , @xmath27 , as evolved by the hydrodynamic equations , it is possible to compute the temperature @xmath95 by a newton - raphson algorithm that solves the equation @xmath110 for @xmath95 ,    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is the iteration counter .      in order to avoid the small time steps , and cpu - time demands connected with the solution of a nuclear reaction network coupled to the hydrodynamic evolution , we apply an approximate method to take into account the basic effects of nuclear burning on the dynamics of the collapsing sms .",
    "we compute the nuclear energy release rates by hydrogen burning ( through the pp - chain , cold and hot cno cycles , and their break - out by the rp - process ) and helium burning ( through the 3-@xmath35 reaction ) as a function of rest - mass density , temperature and mass fractions of hydrogen @xmath98 , helium @xmath99 and cno metallicity @xmath100 .",
    "these nuclear energy generation rates are added as a source term on the right - hand - side of the evolution equation for the conserved quantity @xmath113 .",

    "( [ hydro eqs ] ) ( i.e. we do not solve additional advection equations for the abundances of hydrogen , helium and metals ) , the elemental abundances during the time evolution are fixed",
    ". nevertheless , this assumption most possibly does not affect significantly the estimate of the threshold metallicity needed to produce a thermal bounce in collapsing sms .",
    "the average energy release through the 3-@xmath35 reaction is about 7.275 mev for each @xmath126c nucleus formed . since the total energy due to helium burning for exploding models is @xmath127 ergs ( e.g. @xmath128 ergs for model s1.c ) ; and even considering that this energy is released mostly in a central region of the sms containing @xmath129 of its rest - mass  @xcite , it is easy to show that the change in the metallicity is of the order of @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , the increase of the metallicity in models experiencing a thermal bounce is much smaller than the critical metallicities needed to trigger the explosions .",
    "similarly , the average change in the mass fraction of hydrogen due to the cold and hot cno cycles is expected to be @xmath131 for exploding models .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      after each time iteration the conserved variables ( i.e.  @xmath132 ) are updated and the _ primitive _ hydrodynamical variables ( i.e.  @xmath133 ) have to be recovered .",
    "the recovery is done in such a way that it allows for the use of a general eos of the form @xmath134 .",

    "the new pressure is computed then iteratively by a newton - raphson method until the desired convergence is achieved .",
    "the eos allows us to compute the neutrino losses due to the following processes , which become most relevant just before bh formation :    pair annihilation ( @xmath139    ): most important process above @xmath109 . due to the large mean free path of neutrinos in the stellar medium at the densities of sms",
    "the energy loss by neutrinos can be significant . for a @xmath140 sms most of the energy release in the form of neutrinos originates from this process .",
    "the rates are computed using the fitting formula given by @xcite .    photo - neutrino emission ( @xmath141    ): dominates at low temperatures @xmath142 and densities @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "plasmon decay ( @xmath144    ): this is the least relevant process for the conditions encountered by the models we have considered because its importance increases at higher densities than those present in sms .",
    "the rates are computed using the fitting formula given by @xcite .",
    "the evolution equations are integrated by the method of lines , for which we use an optimal strongly stability - preserving ( ssp ) runge - kutta algorithm of fourth - order with 5 stages  @xcite .",
    "we use a second - order slope limiter reconstruction scheme ( mc limiter ) to obtain the left and right states of the primitive variables at each cell interface , and a hlle approximate riemann solver  @xcite to compute the numerical fluxes in the @xmath145 and @xmath146 directions .",
    "derivative terms in the spacetime evolution equations are represented by a fourth - order centered finite - difference approximation on a uniform cartesian grid except for the advection terms ( terms formally like @xmath147 ) , for which an upwind scheme is used .",
    "the computational domain is defined as @xmath148 and @xmath149 , where @xmath150 refers to the location of the outer boundaries .",
    "we used a cell - centered cartesian grid to avoid that the location of the bh singularity coincides with a grid point .",
    "since it is not possible to follow the gravitational collapse of a sms from the early stages to the phase of black hole formation with a uniform cartesian grid ( the necessary fine zoning would be computationally too demanding ) , we adopt a regridding procedure @xcite . during the initial phase of the collapse we rezone the computational domain by moving the outer boundary inward , decreasing the grid spacing while keeping the initial number of grid points fixed .",
    "initially we use @xmath151 grid points , and place the outer boundary at @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the equatorial radius of the star .",
    "rezoning onto the new grid is done using a polynomial interpolation .",
    "we repeat this procedure 3 - 4 times until the collapse timescale in the central region is much shorter than in the outer parts . at this point , we both decrease the grid spacing and also increase the number of grid points @xmath154 in dependence of the lapse function typically as follows : @xmath155 if @xmath156 , @xmath157 if @xmath158 , and @xmath159 if @xmath160 .",
    "this procedure ensures the error in the conservation of the total rest - mass to be less than @xmath161 on the finest computational domain .      to deal with the spacetime singularity from the newly formed bh we use the method of excising the matter content in a region within the horizon as proposed by @xcite once",

    "1986 solved the relevant nuclear network without the approximations adopted in our work , see section 3.3 for further details ) . despite these differences ,",
    "the results agree fairly well . as discussed in detail in section 7.1",
    "the initial metallicities required to produce an explosion are similar , and a thermal bounce can be produced only if sufficient energy is liberated during the phase when the hcno cycle is active .",
    "the main difference with respect to the work of  @xcite resides in the formulation of einstein s field equations ; in particular , in the foliation of the spacetime ( foliation into a set spacelike hypersurfaces versus a foliation with outgoing null hypersurfaces ) . in order to compare with the results of @xcite , we computed the redshifted total energy output for a model having the same rest - mass , doing the time integration until approximately the same evolutionary stage as in @xcite .",
    "we find that the total energies released in neutrinos differ by less than @xmath181 ( for mode details see section 7.3 ) .",
    "cm      previous simulations of sms collapse to bh in general relativity have been performed with a @xmath23-law eos with @xmath182 ( with the only exception being the work of linke et al .",
    "2001 ) . in order to elucidate the influence of the eos on the dynamics of collapsing sms",

    "we show with a dotted line the time evolution of the central density of model r1.0 with eos-0 , and with a dashed ( solid ) line the time evolution of the central density with eos-2 ( eos-1 ) .",
    "the first thing to note is that the collapse timescale obtained with the @xmath23-law eos is shorter than that obtained with the microphysical eos ( both eos-1 and eos-2 ) , because the ion pressure contribution to the eos raises the adiabatic index above @xmath84 ( see eq .",
    "[ ion_gamma ] ) .",
    "this increase in the adiabatic index helps to stabilize the star against the gravitational instability , and therefore delays the collapse .    on the other hand",

    "this explains the differences between the solid and dashed lines in figure  [ fig1 ] at central densities @xmath188 g/@xmath189 , which correspond to central temperatures @xmath190k .",
    "once the collapse enters this regime , pair creation becomes relevant enough to reduce the adiabatic index below @xmath84 , which destabilizes the collapsing star .",
    "compared to previous works ( shibata & shapiro 2002 ) the use of a microphysical eos instead of a @xmath23-law eos delays the collapse ( mostly due to the baryons while e@xmath183 destabilize ) of an initially gravitationally unstable configuration .",

    "first , we investigated the influence of the eos on _ gravitationally unstable stars _ using model d1 as a reference .",
    "this model corresponds , within the accuracy to which the initial conditions can be reproduced , to a differentially rotating unstable sms discussed by  @xcite ( i.e. their model i ) .",
    "results are displayed in figure  [ fig2 ] . in the upper panel of this figure",
    ", we show the time evolution of the central density for model d1 with eos-0 ( dashed line ) , and with the microphysical eos-1 ( solid line ) .",
    "opposite to the behavior in the case of the uniformly rotating sms r1.0 , the collapse timescale is longer with the @xmath23-law than with the microphysical eos .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the initial central temperature ( @xmath191k ) of model d1 is an order of magnitude higher than the initial central temperature in r1.0 .",
    "therefore , electron - positron pair creation reduces the stability of the star ( by reducing @xmath23 ) already during the initial stages of the collapse .",
    "this behavior is expected to be present also in 3d , and since the collapse timescale is reduced when using the microphysical eos , nonaxisymmetric instablilities would have even less time to grow before the formation of a bh .",
    "it reinforces the conclusions of  @xcite , who showed that the three dimensional collapse of rotating stars proceeds in an approximately axisymmetric manner .",
    "the lower two panels of figure  [ fig2 ] display the growth of the ah mass and the disk mass ( defined as the rest - mass outside the ah of the newly formed bh ) as a function of time ( in units of the gravitational mass for comparison with figures 9 and 10 of saijo & hawke 2009 ) , respectively .",
    "the values of both quantities at the end of the simulation agree , within a @xmath192 difference , with those obtained in 3d by  @xcite .",
    "we note that there is also good agreement ( less than @xmath192 difference ) regarding the time at which an ah is first detected .",
    "these observed small differences are likely due to differences in the initial models and numerical techniques rather than to the influence of nonaxisymmtric effects .",
    "this suggests that our collapse simulation with the same treatment of physics yields good agreement with the 3d simulations of  @xcite    we also investigated the influence of electron - positron pair creation on the evolution of _ gravitationally stable differentially rotating _ sms using model d2 which is similar to the stable differentially rotating model iii of @xcite .",
    "we performed three simulations of model d2 varying the eos . in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the central rest - mass density as a function of time for a @xmath23-law ( dashed line ) , and for the microphysical eos-1 ( solid line ) and eos-2 ( dotted line ) . in agreement with the results obtained by @xcite we find that model d2 represents a stable differentially rotating sms when a @xmath23-law is used .",
    "a persistent series of oscillations is triggered by the initial perturbation in the pressure .",
    "this is also the case with the microphysical eos-2 without the inclusion of electrons and the e@xmath193 pairs .",
    "however , the time evolution of d2 is completely different when e@xmath193 pairs are taken into account .",
    "the influence of pairs is large enough to destabilize model d2 against gravitational collapse .",
    "we note that unlike all other sms considered in this paper , which are @xmath25 models initially unstable to gravitational collapse , model d2 is an initially stable @xmath25 model which becomes gravitationally unstable only by the creation of electron - positron pairs at high temperatures .",
    "hence , using a microphysical eos with electron - positron pairs is crucial to determine the stability of differentially rotating sms .",
    "we note that the central temperature of the initial models d1 and d2 is of the order of @xmath194k . at this temperature , the main source of thermonuclear energy is hydrogen burning via the rp - process .",
    "it is however expected that such sms would previously experience a phase of hydrogen burning via the cold and hot cno cycles which would significantly affect the evolution of the models such that configurations with high @xmath195 as in models d1 and d2 might never be reached .",
    "therefore , models d1 and d2 are not particularly well suited to investigate the existence of a thermal bounce during collapse ( see section 7 ) . exploring in detail the parameter space for the stability of differentially rotating sms with the microphysical eos , and",
    "the existence of a thermal bounce during the collapse phase depending on the initial stellar metallicity , is a major task on its own , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "for these reasons we do not consider differentially rotating sms in this work .",
    "first we consider a gravitationally unstable spherically symmetric sms with a gravitational mass of @xmath178 ( s1.a , s1.b and s1.c ) , which corresponds to a model extensively discussed in  @xcite , and therefore allows for a comparison with the results presented here .",
    "@xcite found that unstable spherical sms with @xmath178 and an initial metallicity @xmath196 collapse to a bh while models with an initial metallicity @xmath197 explode due to the nuclear energy released by the hot cno burning .",
    "they also found that the central density and temperature at thermal bounce ( where the collapse is reversed to an explosion ) are @xmath198 g/@xmath189 and @xmath199 k , respectively .",
    "the left panels in figure  [ fig4 ] show the time evolution of the central rest - mass density ( upper panel ) and central temperature ( lower panel ) for models s1.a , s1.c , r1.a and r1.d , i.e. , non - rotating and rotating models with a mass of @xmath200 .",
    "in particular , the solid lines represent the time evolution of the central density and temperature for model s1.c ( @xmath201 ) and r1.d ( @xmath202 ) . as the collapse proceeds ,",
    "the central density and temperature rise rapidly , which increases the nuclear energy generation rate by hydrogen burning .",
    "since the metallicity is sufficiently high , enough energy can be liberated to increase the pressure and to produce a thermal bounce .",
    "this is the case for model s1.c . in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "we show that a thermal bounce occurs ( at approximately @xmath203 s ) entirely due to the hot cno cycle , which is the main source of thermonuclear energy at temperatures in the range @xmath204 .",
    "the rest - mass density at bounce is @xmath205 g/@xmath189 and the temperature @xmath206 .",
    "these values , as well as the threshold metallicity needed to trigger a thermonuclear explosion ( @xmath201 ) , are higher than those found by  @xcite ( who found that a spherical nonrotating model with the same rest - mass would explode , if the initial metallicity was @xmath197 ) .",
    "on the other hand , dashed lines show the time evolution of the central density and temperature for model s1.a ( @xmath197 ) . in this case , as well as for model s1.b , the collapse is not halted by the energy release and continues until an ah is found , indicating the formation of a bh .",
    "we note that the radial velocity profiles change continuously near the time where the collapse is reversed to an explosion due to the nuclear energy released by the hot cno burning , and an expanding shock forms only near the surface of the star at a radius @xmath207 ( i.e. @xmath208 ) where the rest - mass density is @xmath209 .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig5 ] the profiles of the @xmath145-component of the three - velocity @xmath210 along the @xmath145-axis ( in the equatorial plane ) for the nonrotating spherical stars s1.a ( dashed lines ) and s1.c ( solid lines ) at three different time slices near the time at which model s1.c experiences a thermal bounce .",
    "velocity profiles of model s1.c are displayed up to the radius where a shock forms at @xmath211 and begins to expand into the low density outer layers of the sms .",
    "the evolutionary tracks for the central density and temperature of the rotating models r1.a and r1.d are also shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "a dashed line corresponds to model r1.a , with an initial metallicity @xmath202 , which collapses to a bh .",
    "a solid line denotes model r1.d with @xmath196 , which explodes due to the energy released by the hot cno cycle .",
    "we find that model r1.c with a lower metallicity of @xmath212 also explodes when the central temperature is the range dominated by the hot cno cycle .    as a result of the kinetic energy stored in the rotation of models r1.c and r1.d , the critical metallicity needed to trigger an explosion decreases significantly relative to the non - rotating case .",
    "we observe that rotating models with initial metallicities up to @xmath213 do not explode even via the rp - process , which is dominant at temperatures above @xmath214 k and increases the hydrogen burning rate by @xmath215 times relative to the hot cno cycle .",
    "we also note that the evolution time scales of the collapse and bounce phases are reduced because rotating models are more compact and have a higher initial central density and temperature than the spherical ones at the onset of the gravitational instability .",
    "the right panels in figure  [ fig4 ] show the time evolution of the central rest - mass density ( upper panel ) and the central temperature ( lower panel ) for models s2.a , s2.b , r2.a and r2.d , i.e. , of models with a mass of @xmath216 . we find that the critical metallicity for an explosion in the spherical case is @xmath217 ( model s2.b ) , while model s2.a with @xmath218 collapses to a bh .",
    "we note that the critical metallicity leading to a thermonuclear explosion is higher than the critical value found by  @xcite ( i.e. , @xmath219 ) for a spherical sms with the same mass .",
    "the initial metallicity leading to an explosion in the rotating case ( model r2.d ) is more than an order of magnitude smaller than in the spherical case . as for the models with a smaller gravitational mass",
    ", the thermal bounce takes place when the physical conditions in the central region of the star allow for the release of energy by hydrogen burning through the hot cno cycle .",
    "overall , the dynamics of the more massive models indicates that the critical initial metallicity required to produce an explosion increases with the rest - mass of the star .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the total nuclear energy generation rate in erg@xmath220s for the exploding models as a function of time during the late stages of the collapse just before and after bounce .",

    "due to the lack of resolution at the surface of the star , it becomes difficult to compute accurately the photosphere and its effective temperature from the criterion that the optical depth is @xmath228 .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate the photon luminosity produced in association with the thermonuclear explosion , we make use of the fact that within the diffusion approximation the radiation flux is given by      where @xmath230 is the energy density of the radiation , and @xmath231 is the opacity due to electron thompson scattering , which is the main source of opacity in sms .",
    "the photon luminosity in terms of the temperature gradient and for the spherically symmetric case can be written as @xmath232 where @xmath186 is the radiation constant , and @xmath233 the speed of light .",

    "the photon luminosity before the thermal bounce is computed at radii inside the star unaffected by the local dynamics of the low density outer layers which is caused by the initial pressure perturbation and by the interaction between the surface of the sms and the artificial atmosphere .",
    "once the expanding shock forms near the surface , the photon luminosity is computed near the surface of the star .",
    "the lightcurve shows that , during the initial phase , the luminosity is roughly equal to the eddington luminosity @xmath237 until the thermal bounce .",

    "this value of the photon luminosity after the bounce is within a few percent difference with respect to the photon luminosity @xcite found for a nonrotating sms of same rest - mass .",
    "the photon luminosity remains super - eddington during the phase of rapid expansion that follows the thermal bounce .",
    "we compute the photon luminosity until the surface of the star reaches the outer boundary of the computational domain @xmath239 after the bounce . beyond that point",

    "the central density typically increases up to @xmath241 and the central temperature up to @xmath242 just before the formation of an ah .",
    "three isodensity contours for the rotating model r1.a collapsing to a bh are shown in figure  [ fig9 ] , which display the flattening of the star as the collapse proceeds .",

    "the most efficient process for hydrogen burning is the breakout from the hot cno cycle via the @xmath33o@xmath34ne reaction .",
    "nevertheless , we find that models which do not release enough nuclear energy by the hot cno cycle to halt their collapse to a bh , are not able to produce a thermal explosion due to the energy liberated by the @xmath33o@xmath34ne reaction .",

    "the maximum luminosity decreases slightly as the rest - mass of the initial model increases , which was already observed by  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find that the peak of the redshifted neutrino luminosity does not seem to be very sensitive to the initial rotation rate of the star .",

    ", we computed the redshifted total energy output for model s1.a , having the same rest - mass , until approximately the same evolution stage as @xcite did ( i.e. when the differential neutrino luminosity @xmath255 ) .",
    "we find that the total energy released in neutrinos is @xmath256 .",
    "the neutrino luminosities for models experiencing a thermonuclear explosion ( dashed lines in fig .  [ fig10 ] ) peak at much lower values @xmath258 , and decrease due to the expansion and disruption of the star after the bounce .      the axisymmetric gravitational collapse of rotating sms with uniform rotation is expected to emit a burst of gravitational waves  @xcite with a frequency within the lisa low frequency band ( @xmath259 ) .",
    "although through the simulations presented here we could not investigate the development of nonaxisymmetric features in our axisymmetric models that could also lead to the emission of gws ,  @xcite have shown that the three dimensional collapse of rotating stars proceeds in an approximately axisymmetric manner .        where @xmath264 refers to the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment .",
    "the gravitational wave quadrupole amplitude is @xmath265 .",
    "following @xcite we compute the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment by finite differencing the numerical results for the first time derivative of @xmath266 obtained by          where d is the distance of the source , and @xmath269 the spectral energy density of the gravitational radiation given by @xmath270 with @xmath271 we have calculated the quadrupole gravitational wave emission for the rotating model r1.a collapsing to a bh .",

    "we find that , in agreement with @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the burst of gravitational waves due to the collapse of a rotating sms could be detected at a distance of 50 gpc and at a frequency which approximately takes the form @xcite          furthermore , @xcite have recently investigated , by means of three - dimensional general relativistic numerical simulations of equilibrium tori orbiting bhs , the development of the nonaxisymmetric papaloizou - pringle instability ( ppi ) in such systems  @xcite , and have found that a nonaxisymmetric instability associated with the @xmath277 mode grows for a wide range of self - gravitating tori orbiting bhs , leading to the emission of quasiperiodic gws .",
    "in particular ,  @xcite have pointed out that the emission of quasiperiodic gws from the torus resulting after the formation of a smbh via the collapse of a sms could be well above the noise sensitivity curve of lisa for sources located at a distance of 10gpc .",
    "such instability appears for tori whose angular velocity in the equatorial plane expressed as @xmath278 has @xmath279 where @xmath280 corresponds to the keplerian limit , i.e. @xmath281 in newtonian gravity .",
    "we find that the torus ( defined as the rest - mass outside the ah ) that forms after the collapse to a bh of the uniformly rotating model r1.a ( when the mass of the ah exceeds @xmath245 of the adm mass ) does not fulfill the above condition for the development of the ppi .",

    "we have presented a comparison with previous studies , and investigated the influence of the eos on the collapse .",
    "we emphasize that axisymmetric calculations without rotation ( i.e. models s1 and s2 ) retain the spherical symmetry of the initial configurations as there are no physical phenomena to produce asphericity and numerical artifacts associated with the use of cartesian coordinates are negligibly small .",
