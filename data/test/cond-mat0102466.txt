    "when dissolved in aqueous solvent , lipids self - assemble into an amazing variety of different structures as a function of concentration and temperature @xcite .",
    "most prominent is the lamellar phase , which consists of a stack of lipid bilayers separated by layers of water .",
    "in fact , the lipid bilayer constitutes the basic building block of biological membranes ; in eucaryotic cells , it not only envelopes the cell itself , but also separates its nucleus and its organelles from the cytosol , and builds up the endoplasmic reticulum , the golgi apparatus and the uni - lamellar vesicles which serve as reaction chambers and transport vehicles .",
    "the predominance of the lamellar phase at ambient temperatures derives from the fact that in contrast to surfactants , which usually have large headgroups and form micelles , lipids have rather bulky hydrocarbon chains .",
    "a so - called _ bilayer lipid _ has a chain region cross section which is of similar size as the area per head group ; thus the spontaneous curvature is small and the lipid forms a lamellar phase .",
    "if temperature is increased , the size of the head groups hydration shell decreases , spontaneous curvature increases and the lipid monolayers tend to curve towards the water regions . since the tendency of lipid monolayers to curve",
    "is frustrated in the lamellar phase , it is often found to transform into a inverse hexagonal phase which consists of a two - dimensional array of inverse cylindrical micelles .",
    "spontaneous curvature can also be increased by changing molecular architecture , by adding lipids with bulkier chains or by increasing salt concentration ( since salt screens electrostatic repulsion between charged headgroups ) @xcite .",
    "lipids with spontaneous curvature are often called _ non - bilayer lipids_. for large spontaneous curvature , a cubic phase of inverse spherical micelles is sometimes observed @xcite .",
    "the inverse phases have been denoted _ type ii ( water - in - oil ) phases _ in contrast to _ type i ( oil - in - water ) phases _ which dominate surfactant phase behavior @xcite . although there are some lipids which also form type i phases , we focus here on type ii phases since these are the ones formed by the majority of biologically relevant lipids .",
    "one of the intriguing aspects of the polymorphism of lipid - water mixtures is the existence of yet another structural type , which often occurs between the lamellar and the inverse hexagonal phase . like the lamellar phase , these _ inverse bicontinuous cubic phases _ ( ibcps ) consist of lipid bilayers .",
    "however , now a _",
    "lipid bilayer extends throughout the whole of space , and divides it into two disconnected but interpenetrating labyrinths of cubic symmetry , which both are filled with water .",
    "thus the structure can also be considered to be built from water channels ( that is inverse cylindrical micelles ) as is the inverse hexagonal phase , only that now the channels meet in vertices with a coordination number related to the topology of the cubic phase .",
    "although the ibcps unite the structural elements of the lamellar and the inverse hexagonal phases , in contrast to them they are optically isotropic and highly viscous . like the inverse hexagonal phase ,",
    "the ibcps are stabilized by spontaneous curvature .",
    "therefore they are formed by non - bilayer lipids and their stability can be controlled by changing the lipids spontaneous curvature .",
    "the generic occurrence of ibcps in lipid - water mixtures and their property of dividing space into two interwoven aqueous compartments lends itself readily to speculations on their biological relevance , e.g.  on their possible occurrence in the endoplasmic reticulum or the golgi apparatus @xcite .",
    "a recent survey of a vast number of tem pictures suggests that ibcps are indeed ubiquitous in biological systems @xcite .",
    "the abundance of non - bilayer lipids in biological systems is a longstanding puzzle , and several studies have explored the possible relationship between lipid polymorphism and biological membrane function ( for reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", it was shown that certain cells like _ e. coli _ regulate the relative amount of bilayer and non - bilayer lipid in order to control membrane morphology and function of membrane proteins .",
    "_ e. coli _ mutants lacking the non - bilayer lipid phosphatidylethanolamine were found to be severely impaired in regard to protein transport across the plasma membrane @xcite .",
    "luzzati and coworkers have pointed out that if any ibcp had a biological function , it should be stable at physiological temperatures and in excess water @xcite .",
    "ibcps are also relevant for biotechnological applications , e.g.  they have been used recently as artificial matrix which enables membrane proteins to crystallize in a three - dimensional array @xcite .    since ibcps consist of a lipid bilayer separating two labyrinths of water , is it reasonable to assume that the two monolayers are arranged in a way which is _ locally _ symmetrical about their mid - surface . in differential geometry ,",
    "a surface which curves to both sides in the same way is known as a _ minimal surface _ ,",
    "i.e.  a surface for which the mean curvature vanishes at each of its points",
    ". therefore the mid - surfaces of the ibcp s lipid bilayers are often modeled as _ triply periodic minimal surfaces _",
    "( tpms , sometimes also denoted ipms for _ infinite periodic minimal surfaces _ ) of cubic symmetry @xcite .",
    "indeed it has been confirmed by a thorough analysis of electron density maps derived from x - ray data that the mid - surfaces of these structures can be very close to minimal surfaces @xcite .",
    "note that the stronger requirement of the monolayers _ global _ symmetry about the mid - surface leads to a certain subclass of cubic tpms which is called _ balanced _ since then the two water labyrinths have to be congruent to each other .",
    "since the seminal work of schoen @xcite , it is known that there exists a large variety of different cubic tpms . before schoen s",
    "work , only p , d and c(p ) were known from the 19th century work of schwarz and his students ; then schoen described g , f - rd , i - wp , o , c - to and c(d ) .",
    "more cubic tpms have been found later by karcher and polthier @xcite , fischer and koch @xcite and others , but most of them seem to be too complicated as to be of physical relevance . in figs .",
    "[ figureparallelsurfaces1 ] and [ figureparallelsurfaces2 ] we depict surfaces corresponding to the seven different tpms treated in this work . until now",
    ", only g , d and p have been established to be realized as ibcp in lipid - water mixtures @xcite .",
    "one system for which all three of these phases is stable is 2:1 lauric acid ( la)/dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine ( dlpc ) and water ( with p coexisting with excess water ) @xcite .",
    "the only other system for which g , d and p are known to be stable is didodecylphosphatidylethanolamine and water @xcite ; however , here g exists with hardly no hydration at all , and the regions for d and p are very difficult to access experimentally , thus this system should not be compared with the theoretical results for fully hydrated phases presented here . in all other systems with ibcps ,",
    "only one or two of them are stable ( for example , for monoolein and water , g and d are stable , with d coexisting with excess water @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we present a model which can explain why only g , d and p are observed in lipid - water mixtures and why their actual occurrence seems to depend on the specific system under investigation .",
    "the phase diagram predicted by our model agrees well with the experimental phase diagram for 2:1 la / dlpc and water .",
    "exact ( _ weierstrass _ ) representations are only known for g , d , p and i - wp @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown in recent studies @xcite that these and other cubic tpms can be generated as isosurfaces of a density field , which minimizes the free - energy functional of a simple ginzburg - landau model for amphiphilic systems @xcite .",
    "using the fourier representations of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is now possible to investigate also the physical properties of the ibcps , for whose minimal mid - surfaces no exact representations are known . in particular , the question of whether these structures might correspond to stable ibcps in lipid - water mixtures can now be addressed quantitatively . in this work",
    "we study g , d , p , i - wp , s , c(p ) and f - rd , of which g , d , p , s and c(p ) are balanced .    the most important contribution to the free energy of amphiphilic interfaces is the curvature energy , which dominates all other contributions if the radii of curvature are large compared with molecular length scales @xcite . for the inverse phases in lipid - water mixtures , it is generally assumed that another important contribution to the free energy is the stretching energy of the hydrocarbon chains @xcite . in order to attain optimal free energy ,",
    "the neutral surfaces of the two monolayers should realize at the same time constant mean curvature @xmath0 and constant distance @xmath1 to the minimal mid - surface . since this is not possible geometrically , the free energy will always be frustrated @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of interface ( bending ) and bulk ( stretching ) contributions in self - assembled interfaces is a long - debated issue .",
    "for amphiphilic systems , for which the free energy contributions come mainly from the interfaces , the main problem is of a mathematical nature : the overall solution can be investigated only in a model which allows the interfacial positions to adjust themselves freely . in contrast , in diblock copolymer systems bulk contributions are much more important and models based on random polymer coils and interacting monomer densities are more adequate .",
    "self - consistent mean - field theory for diblock - copolymer systems suggests that in this case , interfacial tension and stretching are equally important @xcite .",
    "recently , this framework has been adapted to treat lipid - water mixtures @xcite .",
    "this approach is complementary to the membrane approach ; it is most useful for the investigation of systems , in which the internal structure of the bilayer is not uniform .",
    "however , self - consistent field theory for large molecules is not expected to describe amphiphilic systems well at large lattice constants , when the membranes internal structure is essentially preserved and the main contributions to the free energy depends on their shape . in particular , only in the membrane approach does it becomes possible to address the role of thermally activated membrane undulations .    in order to study interface - dominated systems",
    ", it has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite to consider the two classes of surfaces , which can completely relax one of the two relevant contributions .",
    "_ parallel surfaces _ to the minimal midsurface realize the optimal chain length @xmath1 and are frustrated only in their bending energy , while _ constant - mean - curvature surfaces _ ( cmc - surfaces ) realize the given spontaneous curvature , but are frustrated in their stretching energy .",
    "the mathematical properties of parallel surfaces are well known in terms of the properties of the underlying minimal surface ; the parallel - surface model has therefore been the main tool for the investigation of ibcps @xcite . up to now",
    ", the main difficulty of this approach has been to take into account the variation of gaussian curvature over the minimal mid - surface . in earlier work",
    ", the curvature energy was therefore expanded in moments of the distribution of the gaussian curvature . in ref .",
    "@xcite this was done up to eighth order for d , and in ref .",
    "@xcite up to second order for p , d and g. cmc - surfaces @xcite have the advantage that they offer an unified picture for all relevant phases  lamellar , inverse bicontinuous cubic , inverse hexagonal and inverse micellar cubic phases are modelled by planes , cubic cmc - surfaces , cylinders and spheres , respectively .",
    "however , since no exact representations are known , the stretching frustration for ibcps has so far been evaluated numerically for d only @xcite .",
    "we will show below that in the case of short chains ( or large lattice constants ) , stretching energy is prohibitively large , and the two monolayers of a ibcp in lipid - water systems can be modeled by parallel surfaces . in the case of long chains ( or small lattice constants ) , we expect stretching and bending to be equally important ; this agrees with the results for diblock copolymers , which are in the long chain limit .",
    "our reasoning implies that cmc - surfaces are not a good representation of ibcps in lipid - water systems for physical reasons .",
    "however , for small distances to the minimal mid - surface , their mathematical properties are very similar to the ones of parallel surfaces @xcite , thus many results from the parallel surface model will carry over to the cmc - model .",
    "in general , however , the parallel surface model is more appropriate both for physical and mathematical reasons . moreover , there is strong experimental evidence for it , both from a detailed reconstruction of electron densities @xcite and from analysis of swelling data @xcite .",
    "in contrast to earlier work , we evaluate the curvature energy in the parallel surface model without any expansion and to high numerical accuracy by first calculating the distribution of gaussian curvature over the minimal mid - surface . for g ,",
    "d , p and i - wp this can be done from their weierstrass - representations .",
    "we also consider the structures s , c(p ) and f - rd by calculating the distribution from the representations which we obtained from ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "our main result is that the free - energy densities of the structures g , d and p are considerably lower than those of the other investigated structures due to their narrow distribution of gaussian curvature over the minimal midsurface .",
    "we show that this result persists when thermal membrane undulations and higher order terms in the bending energy are considered , and argue that potential additional contributions to the free energy are unlikely to change it .",
    "this explains why only g , d and p have been observed in lipid - water mixtures .",
    "in fact , the calculated phase diagram agrees nicely with the experimental one for 2:1 la / dlpc and water , for which these three phases coexist .",
    "we show that due to the existence of a bonnet transformation between g , d and p , these phases coexist along a triple line in our model .",
    "simultaneously , p coexists with an excess excess water due to a mechanism called _",
    "emulsification failure_. the bonnet transformation also implies that the free - energy densities of g , d and p scale as a function of concentration with a universal geometrical quantity , which we term _ topology index_. since the topology index decreases from g to d to p , the gyroid g is most prominent , followed by smaller regions of stability for d and p at higher water concentrations .",
    "any additional contribution to the free energy , which introduces a new length scale , is expected to change the delicate balance between these three phases ; this includes stretching contributions , van der waals and electrostatic interactions .",
    "since such additional effects are specific to a given experimental system , this result explains qualitatively why usually only one or two of these phases are observed in lipid - water mixtures .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows . in sec .",

    "the bending energy of one lipid monolayer is described by the _ canham - helfrich hamiltonian _",
    "@xcite @xmath2 where the integration extends over the monolayer s neutral surface , which is at a distance @xmath1 from the minimal midsurface of the bilayer . in the framework of the curvature model ,",
    "bending and stretching contributions decouple at the neutral surface @xcite ; this allows to disregard area - stretching contributions .",
    "the neutral surface has been shown experimentally to be located close to the polar - apolar interface @xcite . in the curvature model ( [ helfrichhamiltonian ] ) , the neutral surface is characterized by mean curvature @xmath3 , gaussian curvature @xmath4 and differential area element @xmath5 ; the superscript @xmath1 indicates that the neutral surface is a parallel surface .",
    "the model parameters are the spontaneous curvature @xmath0 , the bending rigidity @xmath6 and the saddle - splay modulus @xmath7 of the monolayers . for lipids ,",
    "the bending rigidity @xmath6 for a monolayer is of the order @xmath8 .",
    "usually the saddle - splay modulus @xmath7 is assumed to have a small negative value ; in fact the curvature model without any additional constraints is well - defined only for @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous curvature @xmath0 can be considered to result from the mismatch between optimal head group area , volume incompressibility of the chains and optimal chain length . for",
    "non - ionic lipids , it depends mainly on temperature , which changes the head group hydration and therefore optimal head group area .",
    "since lipids typically form lamellar and inverse phases , where the monolayers prefer to bend towards their polar sides , we define positive curvature to be towards the water regions .",
    "we assume that spontaneous curvature scales with temperature as @xmath10 , since such a linear relationship seems to hold very well for ternary surfactant systems @xcite .    the stretching energy can be assumed to be harmonic about the average chain length @xmath1 , so that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the local chain length .",
    "the stretching modulus @xmath13 is itself a function of the average chain length @xmath1 .",
    "the relevant scaling law has to be obtained from a microscopic model ; here , we model the lipid monolayer as a gaussian polymer brush grafted to the polar - apolar interface , but more realistic models give similar results @xcite .",
    "the stretching energy per chain reads @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the ( microscopic ) kuhn length and @xmath16 the number of kuhn segments . enforcing the volume constraint @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the grafting density ) , and transforming from energy per chain to energy per area , results in a potential of the form with @xmath19 .",
    "thus the stretching modulus @xmath13 scales inversely with average chain length @xmath1  stretching becomes very difficult for short chains @xcite .",
    "although the bending energy is well known not to depend on microscopic details , for our purpose it is important to note that the bending rigidity @xmath6 also depends on the average chain length @xmath1 .",
    "starting from the stretching energy of and taking into account how the chain volume varies with curvature , results in the bending energy of with @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the result that the bending rigidity @xmath6 scales with the third power of film thickness @xmath1 is well known also from the elasticity of thin solid sheets .",
    "we now can estimate the relative importance of bending and stretching contributions .",
    "it is known that for both cmc - surfaces and parallel surfaces , the normalized standard deviations of @xmath12 and @xmath3 , respectively , are almost independent of hydrocarbon volume fraction @xcite , so that @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the lattice constant",
    ". therefore @xmath24 .",
    "thus , for small chain length @xmath1 ( large lattice constant @xmath23 ) , the stretching term is much larger and the chains can be assumed to be of constant length .",
    "this corresponds to the well - known result that the curvature energy is the relevant contribution to the free energy as long as the curvature radii ( that is the lattice constants ) are much larger than any molecular length @xcite . only for large chain length @xmath1 ( small lattice constant @xmath23 ) ,",
    "the bending energy becomes comparable and both terms have to be considered .",
    "experimentally , this corresponds to the fact that for small water content ( i.e. chain length @xmath1 of comparable size as lattice constant @xmath23 ) , the bicontinuous cubic phases become unstable with respect to the hexagonal phase , whose geometrical properties require larger chain stretching . note that the relative importance of stretching and bending is asymmetric : since the chain length @xmath1 can not be larger than the lattice constant @xmath23 , there is no regime in which bending can be neglected .",
    "thus cmc - surface will never be a good approximation for monolayers in lipid - water systems .",
    "however , the stretching frustration can be relaxed by swelling the bilayer with oil ; therefore cmc - surfaces are good approximations for amphiphilic monolayers in ternary systems with oil , water and amphiphile @xcite .",
    "similar considerations of the relative importance of stretching and bending can be found also in the context of large membrane inclusions ( like transmembrane proteins ) where chains have to stretch in order to decrease the hydrophobic mismatch at the inclusion boundary @xcite .",
    "for the rest of this paper , we proceed within the framework of the parallel surface model .",
    "we assume that the interfaces between the tail and head group regions of the two lipid monolayers in a icbp are located at distances @xmath25 away from a given cubic tpms ; typically @xmath1 has values between one and two nanometers .",
    "note that for a tpms the mean curvature satisfies @xmath26 everywhere ( where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the two principal curvatures ) , while the gaussian curvature @xmath29 varies as function of the position and is only restricted to satisfy @xmath30 .",
    "the differential area element @xmath31 , the mean curvature @xmath32 and the gaussian curvature @xmath33 on the parallel surfaces then follow as functions of @xmath1 and the quantities @xmath5 and @xmath4 on the minimal mid - surface @xcite , with @xmath34 note that these formulae are special cases of steiner s theorem of integral geometry ; they are therefore no approximations for small @xmath1 , but exact .",
    "since minimal surfaces have @xmath30 , positive mean curvature is defined here to correspond to positive @xmath1 .",
    "the effective bending energy of the lipid bilayer is only a function of the gaussian curvature @xmath4 of the minimal midsurface since its mean curvature @xmath3 vanishes . in an expansion for small chain length @xmath1 ,",
    "it can be expressed as an infinite series in powers of @xmath4 .",
    "using and yields up to order @xmath35 @xmath36 therefore the effective saddle - splay modulus for the lipid bilayer , @xmath37 , is not just the sum of the monolayer s moduli , but is corrected to higher positive values due to the presence of the spontaneous curvature @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that as long as @xmath38 , the ibcps are favored over the lamellar phase , since the preferred curvature of the monolayers translates into a topological advantage of saddle - type bilayer structures .",
    "the third term in favors saddle - type structures in any case , and also removes the degeneracy which minimal surfaces might experience under deformations which preserve the minimal surface property .",
    "this has been noted in a seminal work by bruinsma @xcite ; in his notation , we have @xmath39 for the elastic modulus of the @xmath40-term .",
    "the volume fraction occupied by the hydrocarbon can be calculated as @xmath41 where we have used the gauss - bonnet theorem @xmath42 . @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote surface area and euler characteristic of the given cubic tpms in the conventional unit cell with unit lattice constant . for the following ,",
    "it is useful to introduce the _ topology index _ @xmath45 .",
    "this quantity is independent of scaling and choice of unit cell and characterizes a given tpms s topology in an universal way ; the higher its value , the smaller is the porosity and the larger the specific surface area of a tpms .",
    "it is the only quantity which characterizes a two - dimensional minimal surface in three - dimensional space independently of lattice constant and choice of unit cell , and its relevance for the description of bicontinuous cubic phases in amphiphilic systems has been discussed before @xcite .",
    "the topology index of the various tpms is of order @xmath46 and is given in tab .",
    "[ tableindex ] .",
    "the gyroid g is expected to have the highest value since it divides space into labyrinths with threefold coordinated vertices .",
    "s has a similar value for @xmath47 , since it features a mixture of three- and fourfold coordinated vertices . then comes the double diamond structure with fourfold coordinated vertices , while all other structures have higher values . in tab .",
    "[ tableindex ] we collect the values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath47 for the cubic tpms investigated in this work as obtained from our numerical representations in the framework of a simple ginzburg - landau theory ( see below ) .",

    "[ tablenumbers ] . comparing numerical and exact values shows that for most structures , our numerical results are quite accurate . due to numerical limitations for the more complicated structures , the values for s and f - rd are less precise .",
    "in particular , we expect s to have a smaller value for @xmath47 than g.    equation ( [ hydrocarbonvolume ] ) can be inverted numerically to give the dimensionless function @xmath48 , the lattice constant @xmath23 in units of the chain length @xmath1 , as a function of hydrocarbon volume @xmath49 . for small @xmath49",

    "a typical value for @xmath1 is @xmath53 , so that for @xmath54 we have @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "note that at a given @xmath49 , the ratio of the lattice constants of two coexisting ibcps is simply the ratio between their scaled surface areas @xmath43 .",
    "in figs .  [ figureparallelsurfaces1 ] and [ figureparallelsurfaces2 ] we depict for each of the structures considered one of the two monolayers for the hydrocarbon volume fraction @xmath54 .",
    "then the volume fraction of each of the two labyrinths is @xmath62 .",
    "we are now in a situation to rewrite the curvature energy from for our purpose .",
    "we consider a typical experimental situation , in which temperature is controlled at constant volume . as explained above , changing temperature @xmath63 amounts to changing spontaneous curvature @xmath0 . under the assumption of incompressibility of both components",

    ", we arrive at the free energy per _ unit volume _ as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "however , @xmath49 is not a controlled quantity , since at two phase coexistence , it is not clear how it will distribute into the two phases . the controlled quantity can be considered to be the chemical potential coupled to @xmath49 ( that is the derivative of free energy  or free energy volume density  for hydrocarbon volume fraction  or interfacial area ) , and therefore phase transitions have to be calculated by using the maxwell construction for the free energy density as a function of @xmath49 ( which amounts to requiring the same chemical potential for both phases ) .",
    "we want to remark parenthetically that the free energy per _ unit area _ can not be used to calculate phase coexistences , since an exchange of area , controlled by the chemical potential of the lipid , has to be allowed between coexisting phases .",

    "previously , similar expressions have been expanded in small @xmath49 ( which is equivalent to small @xmath1 ) @xcite , similarly as discussed in .",

    "higher - order terms in would result in a free - energy density which has a similar structure as . as we will see below",
    ", this means that our results will remain valid in the case that higher - order terms are included in the curvature energy of the monolayers .",
    "it is well known that thermal fluctuations can contribute significantly to the free - energy of amphiphilic systems . since we consider the regime where the stretching energy dominates , undulations are the favored fluctuation modes . for the lamellar phase , they give rise to steric repulsion @xcite , which in our case can be written as @xmath83 where @xmath84 from monte carlo simulations @xcite and field - theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "for an ibcp , steric repulsion is hardly relevant since the lateral correlation length @xmath85 is of the order of the lattice constant @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the perpendicular correlation length @xmath86 , and few membrane collisions should occur .",
    "however , fluctuations of the lipid bilayer lead to a renormalization of @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite for all phases .",
    "since @xmath6 multiplies the average mean curvature squared , which vanishes for the mid - plane , only the renormalization of @xmath87 at length scale @xmath88 has to be taken into account .",
    "we identify the typical length scale of a cubic structure with @xmath89 .",

    "note also that the thermal fluctuations also give a contribution to the free energy , which is linear in the membrane area .",
