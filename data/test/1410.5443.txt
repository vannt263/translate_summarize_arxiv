    "one of the major recent advances in the understanding of strongly correlated quantum many body systems has been the investigation of quantum entanglement in terms of area laws @xcite , the entanglement spectrum @xcite and the associated entanglement hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the structure of entanglement in gapped quantum systems has resulted in the powerful parameterization of quantum ground states in terms of so - called tensor network states , such as matrix product states ( mps ) @xcite or their higher dimensional analogues , projected entangled pair states ( peps ) @xcite . in a translation invariant tensor network state",
    ", the entanglement features can be extracted from the leading eigenvector of the so - called ( quantum ) transfer matrix , which naturally appears whenever the quantum state is mapped to a classical partition function ( using _ e.g. _ a trotter decomposition ) and then sliced along the virtual direction , _",
    "i.e. _ the trotter direction or direction of imaginary time @xcite . in a very recent publication @xcite",
    ", we have observed that the other eigenvalues of the transfer matrix also contain useful information , _",
    "i.e. _  they contain crucial information about the elementary excitations and the corresponding dispersion relations of the system .",
    "this is in many ways surprising as this information is completely encoded in the ground state description of the system , a priori without any information about the original hamiltonian for which it was the exact or approximate ground state .",
    "this relation is extremely useful for the case of two - dimensional systems , where systematic methods to extract the dispersion relation of elementary excitations are virtually non - existent .",
    "this was illustrated in ref .   by studying the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki model @xcite .",
    "however , for the case of two - dimensional quantum spin systems exhibiting topological quantum order , the excitation spectrum can be much richer .",
    "in contrast to trivial phases , where the elementary excitations can provably be created as bloch waves of localized perturbations @xcite , elementary excitations in topological phases are typically anyons that come with `` strings attached . ''    the peps representation of topologically ordered ground states , either as variational approximation @xcite or as exact description of the levin - wen model wave functions @xcite , has been well established . here",
    "we study the full spectrum of the transfer matrix of topologically ordered peps @xcite on the infinite plane or cylinder .",
    "much like the prisoners in plato s cave , we observe one - dimensional domain walls in the spectrum of the transfer matrix as shadows of the true anyons in the two - dimensional world . by clarifying how the different anyon sectors are manifested at the virtual level , we can probe the dispersion relation of single anyon states .",
    "we discuss how the presence of anyons , and thus of topological order , requires a particular type of symmetry breaking in the fixed point subspace of the transfer matrix and how anyon condensation or confinement @xcite is reflected in these virtual description .",
    "we illustrate our results by studying the peps description of the toric code model with string tension and the resonating valence bond state .",
    "our results also confirm that we can construct approximate eigenvectors of peps transfer matrices using the matrix product ansatz developed for one - dimensional quantum hamiltonians in @xcite .",
    "the convience of the tensor network description of quantum states is that the global , topological properties of the state are reflected in the symmetries of the local tensors .",
    "since topological phases are not characterized by local order parameters , these symmetries act purely on the virtual levels of the tensors .",
    "in particular , it was recently established that topological order in peps can be characterized by the existence of matrix product operators ( mpo ) which can be pulled through the lattice at the virtual level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pulling ] ) @xcite . closed mpo loops around a topologically trivial region define the invariant subspace on which the peps tensors are supported and in this way characterizes the topological properties of the state , such as the topological corrections to the entanglement entropy .",
    "they act as virtual operators @xmath0 and satisfy a fusion algebra @xmath1 . indeed , as shown in ref .",
    ", for the case of the levin - wen string net models , the different mpos @xmath0 can be associated to and labeled by the different string types @xmath2 of the input category that defines the string net model .",
    "a peps in a trivial phase is characterized by a single mpo @xmath3 that acts as the identity in the relevant subspace .",
    "another interesting case is that of the quantum double models , which can be described using @xmath4-injective peps @xcite .",
    "this is a special case of the formalism of ref .   where the mpos are labeled by the group elements @xmath5 and correspond to representations @xmath6 of the group action at the virtual level .",
    "the pulling through condition is satisfied since the tensors are only supported on the invariant subspace defined by the projector @xmath7 .    while the pulling - through conditions ensure that the presence of an mpo string can not be detected locally , noncontractible mpo loops can have global effects , such as adding a nontrivial flux in the system , and can therefore be used to map one ground state to another one .",
    "the relevance of these virtual mpos is that also away from the the renormalization group ( rg ) fixed point where the physical string operators are spread out and not exactly known @xcite the mpos at the virtual level remain strictly local and the ` pulling - through ' symmetry of the peps tensor is exactly preserved .     the pulling through equation between the peps tensor ( red ) and mpo tensor ( blue ) is characteristic for topological order in peps . ]      having a translation invariant peps description of the ground state of a topological phase , one can easily argue that a suitable ansatz to model single anyon excitations is obtained by modifying the ground state tensors in a local region ( e.g. a single site ) and attaching a half infinite string to it , which is exactly given by this mpo at the virtual level",
    ". the mpo will give rise to the non - trivial braiding statistics of these excitations , while the  pulling - through  assures that the bulk of the string is locally unobservable , so that the energy density is left at its ground state value sufficiently far away from the end point .",
    "away from the rg fixed point , these excitations will disperse and a proper eigenstate can be obtained by building a momentum superposition with momentum @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 direction .",
    "note that the topological quantum numbers of the anyon excitations are not completely specified by the string type @xmath12 , but are determined by structure of the excitation tensor in the ansatz of fig .",
    "[ fig : peps ] . for the case of the quantum doubles",
    ", it has been shown that the string type corresponds to the magnetic flux , whereas the charge quantum number is determined by the representation space on which the local tensor is supported @xcite .",
    "a complete characterization of the different anyon sectors in the peps formalism would take us to far and is presented elsewhere .",
    "a peps ansatz for a topologically non - trivial excitation is constructed from the tensors of the peps ground state ( red ) and a local perturbation ( green ) with an mpo ( blue string ) attached . by building momentum superpositions ,",
    "the variational excitation energy will depend on the overlap with any difference @xmath13 and @xmath14 between the string end points in ket and bra , as shown here . ]      as in ref .",
    ", one can now argue that the dominant contribution to the variational dispersion relation is coming from the normalization of these states , which is given by the sum of overlaps of ket and bra with string end points at different positions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : peps ] .",
    "if we orient the strings along the @xmath10 direction and first contract the tensor network along the @xmath11 direction , the central object will be the transfer matrix @xmath17 in the @xmath10 direction , as defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : tm ] . the pulling through condition of fig .",
    "[ fig : pulling ] ensures that @xmath17 commutes with infinite mpo strings along the @xmath10 axis in the ket and bra level separately .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath18=[\\openone\\otimes \\overline{o}_{i},\\mathbb{e}]=0 $ ] , @xmath19 where @xmath0 now denotes an infinite mpo of type @xmath12 along the @xmath10 axis .",
    "normalization of the peps ground state requires that the largest eigenvalue of @xmath17 is @xmath20 , and the infinite power of the transfer matrix @xmath17 in the overlap of fig .",
    "[ fig : peps ] in the regions @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be replaced by its left and right fixed point @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which we represent as an infinite mps with matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tm ] ) .",
    "the ( normal ) transfer matrix @xmath17 and one if its fixed points @xmath24 , which we represent as an infinite matrix product state .",
    "excited states @xmath27 of the transfer matrix can be constructed by attaching a half infinite mpo to a local excitation tensor ( green ) , which is equivalent to interpolating between the mps tensors @xmath28 and @xmath29 of two different fixed points . ]",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath17 can have a degenerate fixed point structure , since for a given right fixed point @xmath24 , one can build other fixed points @xmath30 for all @xmath31 .",
    "one could expect that this generally gives rise to an @xmath32-dimensional fixed point subspace .",
    "however , at the rg fixed point of the topological phase , we can easily check that the fixed point subspace of @xmath17 is exactly spanned by @xmath33 for @xmath34 , and is thus only @xmath35-dimensional .",
    "the degeneracy and labeling of the fixed point subspace remains intact throughout the topological phase , even though @xmath36 will no longer exactly equal @xmath37 .",
    "this implies , in particular , that @xmath38 can be expanded into a linear combination of @xmath39 with @xmath40 , compatible with the fact that fusing @xmath41 will have a fusion channel @xmath42 .",
    "we now argue why this property is required in order to support anyonic excitations with a half - infinite virtual string of type @xmath12 .    contracting the tensor network in fig .",
    "[ fig : peps ] from right to left up to position @xmath43 gives rise to some boundary state @xmath24 in the fixed point subspace , whose precise choice is set by the boundary conditions at @xmath44 .",
    "the topological invariance ensures that this choice has no effect on local expectation values .",
    "as we now further contract from right to left , we pass the position @xmath43 containing the excitation in the bra level . here",
    ", the boundary state is perturbed locally at @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , it will be acted upon by a half infinite mpo string of type @xmath12 , which has the effect of changing the mps tensors from @xmath26 to @xmath29 with @xmath46 in the region @xmath47 . at the level of the transfer matrix",
    ", the boundary state now takes the form of a domain wall interpolating between the two different fixed points .",
    "because of translation invariance , all overlaps corresponding to the momentum superposition in the @xmath10 direction can be summed and the resulting state takes the form of a topologically non - trivial state with momentum @xmath8 , similar to the domain wall excitation ansatz used for one - dimensional hamiltonians in ref .  .",
    "we thus have to consider the spectrum of topologically non - trivial eigenstates @xmath48 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tm ] ) of @xmath17 with momentum @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , further contracting up to @xmath49 yields the @xmath8-dependent eigenvalues @xmath50 of @xmath51 to some power @xmath14 , which dictates the @xmath9 dependence of the dispersion relation of the corresponding physical excitation .    at point @xmath49",
    ", the boundary state is acted upon with a second half - infinite string ( also with momentum @xmath8 in the @xmath10 direction ) , now in the ket level .",
    "after that , the state is collapsed onto the topologically trivial left fixed point @xmath23 . in order to have a non - vanishing overlap , the corresponding boundary state with half - infinite strings in both the ket and bra level should have a contribution in the trivial sector .",
    "this will be true if the property stated above is satisfied , i.e. @xmath52 for all @xmath24 .",
    "as we perturb the state out of the topological phase , there are two ways in which the existence of topologically non - trivial excitations can break down . if the transfer matrix @xmath17 has a unique ( maximally ` symmetric ' ) fixed point which is invariant under the action of any string @xmath0 , then the states @xmath27 interpolate between the same fixed point left and right and are thus indistinguishable from topologically trivial local perturbations ( without string ) .",
    "this scenario is realized when the corresponding anyon has condensed into the ground state @xcite .",
    "a second possibility is that the fixed point structure of @xmath17 has an even larger ` symmetry breaking ' , in such a way that the state with half - infinite strings in ket and bra level is still completely topologically non - trivial and has zero overlap with the left fixed point @xmath23 .",
    "more specifically , the fidelity per site , defined as the largest eigenvalue @xmath53 of @xmath54 with @xmath55 , satisfies @xmath56 and the normalization of the state goes down as @xmath57 with @xmath58 the length of the strings .",
    "hence , the nonzero value of @xmath59 acts as string tension and only bound states of two excitations connected by a finite string can exist , corresponding to the mechanism of confinement .",
    "in the generic case , there can of course be several transitions corresponding to e.g. the condensation of only some anyonic sectors and the induced confinement of other anyon sectors .",
    "note that , since topological phase transitions correspond to symmetry breaking phase transitions at the virtual level of the peps description , we can also find virtual order parameters , as illustrated in the toric code example .",
    "a more in - depth study of these aspects of anyon condensation within the framework of peps will be provided elsewhere .      in the above discussion , we have explained how information about anyon excitations in topological phases can be obtained from the topologically non - trivial excitations of the translation invariant transfer matrix , which has a degenerate fixed point subspace in the case of topological order .",
    "[ fig : alternative ] motivates an alternative approach . by using the pulling through property of the mpo",
    ", we can rewrite the eigenvalue equation for a topologically non - trivial excitation of @xmath17 as a normal ( topologically trivial ) eigenvalue problem for a so - called mixed transfer matrix .",
    "the latter is threaded by an mpo string and is thus defined on a larger vector space corresponding to the presence of additional mpo indices .",
    "physically , we are effectively rotating the mpo strings attached to the anyon excitation to lie along the @xmath11 direction .    by doing so",
    ", we can make the @xmath10-direction finite and periodic , which allows to work on a cylinder with finite circumference .",
    "the fixed points of these mixed transfer matrices were first studied in ref .  .",
    "in this case , physical translations in the @xmath10 direction have a representation as modified translation operators at the virtual level of the transfer matrix with a non - trivial action on the extra mpo indices [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : virtualtranslation ] ] .",
    "this results in a momentum label which can have a fractional discretization in the circumference of the cylinder , similar to what is observed in the case of momentum polarization @xcite .",
    "we elaborate on this aspect in the supplementary material .     rewriting the eigenvalue equation for topologically non - trivial excitations of the normal transfer matrix as a normal eigenvalue equation for a so - called ` mixed ' transfer matrix having additional mpo indices . ]",
    "let us now illustrate this approach using the toric code ground state , to which we apply a local filtering @xmath60 with @xmath61 the fully polarized spin state @xmath62 .",

    "in this supplementary material we reconsider the transfer matrix spectrum for the resonating valence bond state on the kagome lattice .",
    "we elaborate on the construction of the mixed transfer matrix on the cylinder and present the corresponding spectra obtained using exact diagonalization .",
    "then , we revisit the question regarding the validity of the excitation ansatz used in the main text , by comparing the data on the infinite plane obtained using the ansatz with the cylinder data obtained using exact diagonalization , and by providing another measure to test the accuracy of the eigenvector approximation .    first , however , we will discuss explicitly how to construct the mixed transfer operator in the case of 1d systems . a matrix product state @xmath105 $ ] with topologically non - trivial excitations , this is , symmetry breaking , is described by block - diagonal tensors @xmath106 .",
    "the symmetry broken ground states @xmath107 are then described by the individual @xmath108 , and domain wall excitations are obtained by switching between different @xmath12 in the matrix product ( alternatively , this can be achieved by attaching a string operator which transforms a product of @xmath108 to one of @xmath109 ) . in the overlap of the momentum superpositions of these domain walls , the mixed transfer operator @xmath110 appears between the ket and bra position of a domain wall between sectors @xmath12 and @xmath111 .",
    "its leading eigenvalue @xmath53 thus characterizes the correlation function of a pair of such excitations and can be used to infer the momentum @xmath112 and the quasi - energy @xmath113 of the minima of the dispersion .",
    "one can additionally assign quantum numbers of non - broken symmetries to these excitations . to this end , consider a symmetry @xmath114 ( for simplicity , we restrict to finite groups @xmath115 ) .",
    "then , it holds that @xmath116  @xcite , where @xmath117 inherits the algebraic structure of @xmath118 ( more precisely , it is an induced projective representation  @xcite ) . the quantum number of an excitation is then given by the quantum number of the corresponding left eigenvector of the ( mixed ) transfer operator with respect to  @xmath119 .",
    "let us now turn towards 2d cylindrical systems . both the ( perturbed ) toric code and the resonating valence bond states discussed in the main text have a @xmath120-injective peps representation .",
    "the tensors then have a @xmath121 symmetry on the auxiliary indices , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : z2-tensors](a ) .",
    "we consider states on an infinite cylinder with circumference @xmath75 ; the overall state is then obtained by arranging the tensors on the cylinder and contracting the auxiliary indices as in fig .",
    "[ fig : z2-tensors](b ) .",
    "we denote the tensor obtained by blocking all tensors in one column ( which yields an mps ) by @xmath122 .",
    "the four minimally entangled topological sectors , corresponding to the four different quasi - particles , are obtained by__(i ) _ _ placing a string of @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) along the cylinder axis and _ ( ii ) _ choosing boundary conditions supported in the irreducible representations @xmath125 of @xmath126 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : z2-tensors](c ) . by interpreting this system as a one - dimensional chain",
    ", we can then use the symmetry of the peps tensor to construct four independent blocks of the mps tensor @xmath127 by blocking a column as in fig .",
    "[ fig : z2-tensors](d ) .",
    "the corresponding mixed transfer operator is given by @xmath128 as explained in the main text ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : alternative ] ) , the value of @xmath129 and @xmath130 determines the presence of a string in ket and or bra of the corresponding domain wall excitations of the normal transfer matrix .",
    "however , in the thermodynamic limit of the topological phase , the symmetry of the fixed point under @xmath84 ensures that the results for @xmath131 are exactly degenerate , so that the results only depend on @xmath132 .",
    "in addition , because the fixed point subspace of the transfer matrix breaks the @xmath133 symmetry , only the difference @xmath134 can be measured . while it is possible to build fixed points with well defined quantum numbers for @xmath135 and @xmath136 individually ,",
    "the pairs @xmath137 and @xmath138 will also be exactly degenerate , and only depend on the difference @xmath134 .",
    "note that on a cylinder with finite circumference @xmath75 , the degeneracy will only manifest itself up to exponentially small corrections in @xmath75 .      by blocking the cylindrical peps into an mps ,",
    "the translation invariance in the @xmath10 direction ( transversal direction ) becomes an on - site symmetry , and we can still label the eigenvectors of the transfer matrix with the corresponding quantum numbers . to this end , we need to determine the virtual action @xmath68 of the physical translation operator @xmath67 ; the momenta are then given by the eigenvalues of @xmath139 evaluated on the corresponding eigenvector of @xmath140 .",
    "this can be done by considering fig .",
    "[ fig : virtualtranslation ] for this particular case .",
    "as one can see , the action of @xmath68 corresponds to a translation of the virtual indices .",
    "however , if a string of @xmath72 s is present ( i.e. @xmath141 ) , this string is moved as well , and restoring it at its original position requires an additional multiplication to be performed by @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the regular translation operator and @xmath144 acts on the spin next to the location of the string .",
    "this leads to an important consequence for the labeling of momenta .",
    "we have that @xmath145 , which implies that @xmath146 has eigenvalue @xmath147 when both @xmath141 and @xmath148 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath149 , with eigenvalue @xmath147 corresponding to the sectors @xmath150 , @xmath151 or @xmath152 . in those sector , the eigenvalues @xmath153 of @xmath139 are shifted by half a spacing , i.e. , @xmath154 , with @xmath155 .",
    "this can be checked for the data presented in fig .",
