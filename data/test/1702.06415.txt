    "the advent of a new generation of high energy collider experiments , such as relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) , has launched a new era in the study of the hadron production .",
    "plenty of pp , pa and aa collisions data have been accumulated , which allow us to study the nature of the final particle production .",
    "the transverse momentum spectra carry important information about the dynamics of particle production and evolution process of interacting system formed in high energy nuclear collisions . in the past decade , the attempt to understand the particle production mechanism by different theoretical and phenomenological approaches has been a great success  @xcite .",
    "generally , the theoretical investigation of hadron production in heavy - ion collisions is operated into different camps , characterized by the regions of transverse momenta @xmath0 of the produced hadrons . at low @xmath0 statistical hadronization and hydrodynamical models",
    "are generally adopted @xcite , whereas at high @xmath0 jet production and parton fragmentation with suitable consideration of medium effects in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) are the central themes @xcite .",
    "the approaches have been studied essentially independent of each other with credible success in interpreting the experimental data for different @xmath0 regions , since their dynamics are decoupled .    at intermediate and lower",
    "@xmath0 recombination or coalescence subprocess ( reco ) in heavy - ion collisions has been found to be more relevant , which has successfully explained various experimental data @xcite . beside the reco model , there are also other phenomenological models proposed to describe the hadron production . in refs .",
    "@xcite , a two - component model , the particle spectra could be treated as a summation of an exponential ( boltzmann - like ) and a power - law distributions , was suggested . but this model could not describe the charged particle production at very high @xmath0 in central pb+pb collisions at 2.76 tev .",
    "so an additional power - law term was added , which was explained by the peculiar shape of the nuclear modification factor @xmath2 . on the other hand , due to the effect of the collective motion in large colliding system , the relativistic hydrodynamics is usually adopted to consider the particle production , instead of thermodynamic methods .",
    "therefore , the charged particle spectra could be consisted of a hydrodynamic term and two power - law terms suggested as well in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the transverse flow rapidity and the radial flow velocity is parametrized as @xmath5 with @xmath6 for the surface velocity .",
    "@xmath7 is a parameter related to the transverse size of the particle distribution in space and @xmath8 is the distance of the particle from the origin of the coordinate system in the transverse plane .",
    "@xmath9 is the transverse mass and @xmath10 is the rest mass of particle . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the modified bessel functions .",
    "hence , there are eight free parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , which add the difficulty to fit , even it can describe the charged particle spectra very well in central pb+pb collsions .",
    "other forms of multicomponent models , which were derived from multisource thermal model @xcite , were also applied to the particle transverse momentum spectra produced from low energy to high energy heavy - ion collisions .    besides , the tsallis distribution , which was proposed about three decades ago @xcite , has been widely applied to describe final particle production with great success by the theorists and experimentalists @xcite .",
    "it was derived in the framework of non - extensive thermodynamics , @xmath21^{-\\frac{1}{q-1 } } , \\label{tsallis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the entropic factor , which measures the nonadditivity of the entropy and @xmath16 is the temperature .",
    "the two parameters carry important information of the observed colliding system .",
    "@xmath23 is the chemical potential which could be assumed to be 0 , when the colliding energy is high enough and the chemical potential is much smaller than the temperature .",
    "if the self - consistent thermodynamical description is taken into account , the effective distribution @xmath24^q$ ] is needed @xcite .",
    "one should bear in mind , even though different versions of tsallis distribution were adopted by different groups in the literature , it has established the excellent ability to describe the hadron spectra in a large @xmath0 region in pp , pa and aa collisions . here we will try to pursue this approach to the identified particles in the non - central pb+pb collisions at @xmath1 tev . furthermore , for comparison , we will also discuss the particle spectra in the frame of fokker - planck equation and try to get some information about the hadron production during the evolution of the colliding system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections",
    "[ tsallis ] and [ fokker ] , we show our results of particle spectra from pb+pb collisions by a double - tsallis distribution as well as the generalized fokker - plank solution , respectively .",
    "a new two - component distribution which is consisted of the hydrodynamic term and generalized fokker - plank solution is proposed in section  [ hydro ] . in section  [ results ] , a detailed comparison among the three distributions is shown . finally , a summary is given in section [ summary ] .",
    "in our earlier work @xcite , it has been demonstrated that a single tsallis distribution could not fully reproduce the whole structure of the observed particle spectra in central pb+pb collisions at @xmath1 tev .",
    "therefore , a double - tsallis distribution could be proposed , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the transverse energy . when the rest mass of particle @xmath27 , ( [ formula1 ] ) becomes the same as the double - tsallis distribution proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for charged particles , which are dominated by pions .",
    "but when @xmath10 is large , such as kaons , protons and antiprotons , etc . , the mass effect should be taken into account .",
    "compared with the single tsallis distribution , three more parameters are increased , which allowed one to fit the charged particle spectra with @xmath0 up to 100 gev / c in the most central pb+pb collisions @xcite .",
    "recently , the transverse momentum spectra of charged pions , kaons and protons up to @xmath28 gev / c have been measured in pb+pb collisions at @xmath1 tev using the alice detector for six different centrality classes @xcite .",
    "hence , it is right time for us to investigate whether the double - tsallis distribution can describe the identified particle production both at central and non - central collisions .",
    "as shown in figure  [ tsallis ] , ( [ formula1 ] ) reproduces the data for pions and kaons very well , while for protons the situation is different .",
    "firstly , it is remarkable that the spectrum of protons at the centrality 60 - 80% could be described by ( [ formula1 ] ) very well .",
    "this is reasonable and agrees with our previous work .",
    "the peripheral collisions in aa are more similar to the p+p collisions and the single tsallis distribution can fit all the particle spectra produced in p+p collisions @xcite .",
    "secondly , we also have to notice that in figure  [ tsallis](c ) when @xmath29 gev / c , the magenta solid lines are much larger than the data for the central and less central collisions .",
    "the existence of difference is not surprising . compared with pions and kaons ,",
    "the spectra of protons demonstrate different behaviors at low @xmath0",
    ". the particle production dynamics may be different for different particles .",
    "on the one hand , a cascade particle production mechanism was proposed in p+p collisions .",
    "the heavier particles are more likely to be produced at the beginning while the light particles can be produced at all times @xcite . on the other hand , in the quark recombination models @xcite , mesons are formed by combining a quark and an antiquark while baryons by three quarks . because different numbers of ( anti)quarks participate in forming the particles , the structures of their spectra must be different . in this sense ,",
    "our investigation results urge more studies on particle production mechanisms .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "generally speaking , the results shown in the previous sections indicate that the three different methods , which are the double - tsallis distribution , the generalized fokker - plank solution and the new two - component distribution , can describe the experimental data .",
    "but we want to understand which distribution is the optimal choice . to have a clearer picture , we evaluate the degree of agreement of the fitted results with the experimental data .",
    "one can calculate the ratio between the experimental data and the fitted results , which is defined as @xmath30    figure [ ratio1 ] shows the ratio @xmath7 , calculated by ( [ formula1 ] ) , ( [ formula2 ] ) and ( [ formula4 ] ) respectively , as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath0 in linear scale for the centrality 0 - 5% . in figure [ ratio1](a ) , one can see that all points for pions produced in most central collisions from ( [ formula4 ] ) are in the range from -0.1 to 0.1 , while the relative discrepancies from and ( [ formula2 ] ) are large at low @xmath0 region . for kaons ,",
    "( [ formula1 ] ) and ( [ formula2 ] ) have the similar fitting power as shown in figure [ ratio1](b ) , the deviation of the fitting results from data is less than 10% . while , for protons , figure [ ratio1](c ) establishes that ( [ formula1 ] ) is not good for low @xmath0 region , which can be easily seen from figure [ tsallis](c ) .    for the sake of the comprehensive comparison",
    ", we should also check the relative discrepancies of the three equations at other centralities . here",
    ", we only plot the results for the centrality 60 - 80% .",
    "except a few points , the relative discrepancies of the three equations for pions , kaons and protons are in good agreement with the data with deviation from the data less than 10% . remarkably , the fluctuations for pions , kaons , and protons are much smaller than those for the centrality 0 - 5% . in other words ,",
    "the three distributions agree with each other to describe better the particle spectra produced in peripheral collisions , which are similar to p+p collisions .",
    "based on these analyses , we can conclude that ( [ formula4 ] ) is the best one among the three distributions , which is composed of a hydrodynamic term and the generalized fokker - plank solution .",
    "it could well describe the spectra from central to peripheral collisions for pions , kaons and protons .",
    "the proposed hydrodynamic extension ( [ formula4 ] ) of slightly modifies the description of the experimental data for pions at low @xmath0 region , which also gives insight to the particle production mechanism .",
    "in this paper , we have made a detailed study of the double - tsallis distribution , the generalized fokker - plank solution and the new two - component distribution , by fitting the transverse momentum spectra of pions , kaons and protons in pb+pb collisions at @xmath31 tev .",
    "the double - tsallis distribution can fit the particle spectra except the big deviation observed for proton at @xmath32 gev / c for central and less central collisions , while the generalized fokker - plank solution is not able to describe the spectra of pions at very low @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we propose a new two - component distribution as a hydrodynamic extension of the generalized fokker - plank solution accounting for the collective motion effect in order to fit all the particle spectra in pb+pb collisions , especially for extremely low @xmath0 region . according to these results",
    ", we can conclude that the new two - component distribution is the optimal method . from these analyses ,",
    "we get more information about the particle production mechanism in pb+pb collision .",
    "we also wish more exciting results could be found in pb+pb collisions at @xmath33 tev .",
