    "z  canis  majoris ( z  cma ) is a luminous and irregularly variable young stellar object ( yso ) originally classified as a herbig  ae / be star ( haebe , intermediate to high mass pre - main sequence stars ) on the basis of its emission line spectrum and association with reflection nebulosity @xcite .",
    "it underwent an outburst lasting a few months in 1987 , during which its spectral characteristics drastically changed and its visual brightness increased by a modest @xmath1 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "high resolution optical and near - infrared ( ir ) spectra in the post - outburst state showed features typical of the fu  orionis ( fuori ) class , believed to be disk objects undergoing a period of very active accretion @xcite .",
    "under this interpretation , z  cma is unique in that it is the yso with the highest known accretion rate ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the ranges of visual and near - ir magnitudes of the unresolved system found in the literature are : v=@xmath3 , j=@xmath4 , h=@xmath5 and k=@xmath6 .",
    "a companion was discovered in ir speckle observations by @xcite .",
    "the binary system had an angular separation of @xmath7 and position angle pa=@xmath8 ( measured east from north ) , where the primary is defined to be the north - west ( nw ) component , which dominates the flux beyond @xmath9 .",
    "individual spectral energy distributions reconstructed from the spatially resolved photometry , combined with unresolved photometry at optical and far - ir wavelengths , revealed that the emission in both components is dominated by circumstellar material , i.e. there are no signs of stellar photospheres .",
    "the south - east ( se ) component has been identified as the fu  ori object inferred by @xcite , while the nw component is most - likely a haebe star surrounded by an asymmetric dust envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the last few years",
    ", haebe and fu  ori objects have also been resolved using the techniques of long baseline interferometry and aperture masking at near - ir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "however , the interpretation of the interferometer data depends on important model assumptions , namely the extent to which the measured visibilities are systematically reduced ( which results in an overestimate of the size measured ) by flux arising in a widely - separated companion or scattered by distant dust .",
    "the discovery reported here took place in the larger context of a program of adaptive optics ( ao ) observations of haebe systems , aimed at providing these constraints by exploring the level of extended emission present at spatial scales intermediate between the very narrow interferometric beams and the large scale nebulosity known to surround these systems .",
    "we observed z  cma on 2001  january  11 , using the ao system at the keck - ii telescope @xcite .",
    "these observations were carried out using the slit viewing camera ( scam ) of the nirspec instrument @xcite as the imaging science detector . in these observations , z  cma itself ",
    "unresolved by the shack - hartmann sensor sub - apertures  was used as the source of visible photons for the ao wavefront sensor . in order to achieve highest sensitivity to scattered emission from circumstellar material , we limited our observations to the shorter wavelength near - ir bands : j ( n3 filter , @xmath10 ) and h ( n5 filter , @xmath11 ) .    our observing procedure consisted of establishing the maximum integration time per frame which did not saturate the bright stellar core , and co - adding 30 such frames . for all frames the correlated double sampling ( cds )",
    "readout mode was used . in order to search for circumstellar emission beyond the normal field of view of the scam array in ao mode ( @xmath12 ) and to improve the image quality  by removing the effect of the nirspec slit",
    " we recorded 4 such frames nodding the telescope around a square by offsets of @xmath13 , which resulted in a total field of view in the combined image of @xmath14 .",
    "we also recorded j ",
    "band frames in which the central core was allowed to saturate the detector , in order to further augment our sensitivity to faint extended emission .    the results presented here have been obtained from the ao - corrected images , after straightforward processing ( i.e. no deconvolution has been applied ) consisting of : bad pixel removal , flat field correction ( using images of near - sunrise sky ) and sky background subtraction ( using images obtained with a telescope offset of @xmath15 from the target source ) .    as an indication of the seeing quality and performance of the ao system at the time of our z  cma observations , the images of an unresolved calibrator star ",
    "hd  54335 , chosen to also have similar visual and near - ir magnitude as z  cma  were fitted with the sum of two gaussians of different widths , representing the narrow core and wide halo into which partially corrected point spread functions ( psf ) can be approximately decomposed . using the full - width at half - maximum of the core component as a measure of",
    "effective seeing , we find on average 45  mas and 46  mas at j and h bands respectively , both close to the diffration limit of the 10  m telescope ( 31 and 42 mas respectively ) .",
    "for this analysis , as well as in the rest of the paper , stellar images are fitted with sub - pixel resolution using 2-dimensional pixelized gaussians .",
    "we first derive the basic parameters of the z  cma binary from our images .",
    "a model consisting of two scaled and displaced gaussians gives us the binary separation , pa , and flux ratio .",
    "these parameters are derived for each of the n frames in our dithering procedure , and the final value adopted is the mean of these independent measurements , with a statistical error given by their standard deviation .",
    "the plate scale and orientation of the ao images were calibrated using observations of the quadruple system @xmath16 ursae majoris ( hd  98230 ) and its published orbital elements @xcite . given that the published orbit applies to the `` aa '' center of mass and `` b '' component ( the `` a '' component was unresolved until recent , unpublished , keck aperture masking observations in june 2000 by one of the authors  j. d. monnier ) , we estimated the location of the former in our images using the published masses @xcite . assigning 10% and 30% mass uncertainties to the `` a '' and `` a '' components respectively ,",
    "we obtain a plate scale of @xmath17  mas / pixel ( 1.9% different than nominal value of 17 mas / pixel ) and a pa offset ( calculated @xmath18 nominal ) of @xmath19 .",
    "these results are summarized in table  [ bintable ] .",
    "in addition , our 1.25@xmath0 m and 1.65@xmath0 m measurements are consistent with both binary components being unresolved ; that is , we find no evidence for the extended component reported by @xcite at somewhat longer wavelengths ( @xmath20 m ) .",
    "figure  [ binfig2 ] shows the history of measurements of the z  cma orbital elements up to this work @xcite spanning a total of 11.2 years , and linear fits to the data .",
    "while only a marginal change in the angular separation is detected ( @xmath21 for the linear fit , compared to 0.8 for the weighted mean ) , the pa has clearly increased over this period of time ( @xmath22 for the linear fit , compared to 5.8 for the weighted mean ) , making this the first detection of orbital motion in this system .",
    "the linear fit to the pa data gives a total change of @xmath23 . for a distance to z  cma of about 1150  pc @xcite",
    ", the @xmath24 angular separation corresponds to a projected linear separation of 115  au .",
    "assuming masses for the components of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , typical of t  tauri and haebe stars respectively , the period of a face - on circular orbit would be @xmath27 years , and the expected rate of position angle change @xmath28 degrees / year .",
    "therefore , our detection of a @xmath29 change in about a decade is indeed plausible .",
    "previous workers have found the near - ir flux ratios to be highly variable : @xmath30_j=0.09 - 0.3 $ ] , @xmath30_h=0.25 - 0.5 $ ] and @xmath30_k=1.6 - 3.3 $ ] @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in table  [ bintable ] , we find the unexpected result that the nw ( haebe ) component becomes brighter than the se ( fu  ori ) component at h - band , in contrast to previous reports that the nw component became the brightest in the system at k - band and longer wavelengths .",
    "this flux reversal could be naturally explained if the fu  ori object has been continuously fading following its recent outburst .",
    "approximate absolute photometry may be derived from our observations as follows .",
    "the total flux of the z  cma system at our epoch is estimated using the calibrator ( hd  54335 ) as a flux standard .",
    "its 2mass fluxes are : @xmath31  jy and @xmath32  jy . from our images we derive a ratio of fluxes between z  cma and hd  54335 of @xmath33 and @xmath34 at j and h bands respectively .",
    "the resulting combined fluxes of z  cma as well as those of its components , derived using our estimates of the sum and ratio of fluxes , are also given in table  [ bintable ] .",
    "indeed , these estimates clearly show that the fu  ori object has been dimming between 1986 and 2001 . in particular , comparing with the epoch of the @xcite observations ,",
    "the se fluxes have decreased by @xmath35 mag and @xmath36 mag at j and h bands respectively . in contrast , the haebe photometry is consistent with no flux change at j band ( @xmath37 ) and a marginally significant increase at h band ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we have detected a new jet - like feature in deep images at j  band in which the stellar cores were saturated . unfortunately , there are many imaging artifacts in such high - dynamic range images , and we will briefly mention the dominant ones before discussing the `` jet - like '' feature discovered around z  cma . in figure  [ ao1 ]",
    "we show the mosaiced images of z  cma and the unresolved reference star ( hd  54335 ) , in which an azimuthally - averaged psf core has been subtracted to artifically enhance the dynamic range in the image . we have marked the dominant artifacts common to the both z  cma and the reference star , but",
    "note the interesting new feature _ not _ associated with the psf .",
    "prior to this detection , no extended structure was known for z  cma at these wavelengths and scales ( @xmath39 arcsec ) beyond that of a pure binary ( nebulosity on larger scales has been reported by * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ jetfig ] shows a close - up of the region near the new narrow feature , rotated so that north is up and east is left . in order to remove the wings of the psf ,",
    "we have subtracted a two - component model of the binary star using the psf measured with the reference star .",
    "clearly this subtraction is imperfect , as evidenced by the speckled residuals within 0.5@xmath40 of the binary . despite these obvious flaws ,",
    "the dynamic range ( dr ) in the image ( unsaturated peak to noise ratio ) is @xmath41 200000 beyond @xmath42 from the central binary , and the signal - to - noise in the jet - like feature is greater than 10 .",
    "the jet - like feature extends to @xmath43 ( 1135  au ) from the central binary in the s - sw direction , and has a width of @xmath44 ( 115  au ) .",
    "it is likely that the extended emission we have detected is stellar light or disk emission scattered off of dust grains , since at the observed distance from the central stars this dust would be too cold to emit thermally in the near - ir . alternatively , the emission could arise from a faint emission line within j  band bandpass , a possibility which needs to be eliminated in follow - up observations .",
    "we note that the jet - like feature is not detected in our h  band images , likely a consequence of the lower dr in those images ( with non - saturated peaks ) and/or the lower efficiency of scattering by dust at longer wavelengths .",
    "assuming scattering by dust , an intriguing interpretation is that this scattering takes place off the inner walls of an evacuated cavity carved by the well - known large - scale outflow .",
    "a bipolar outflow was discovered by @xcite , traced by several herbig - haro objects ( blue and red - shifted sides ) and a jet ( blueshifted side , also sw direction ) .",
    "the total extent of the outflow was 3.6 pc , oriented at pa=@xmath45 .",
    "@xcite reported an optical jet in [ oi ] extending approximately 1@xmath40 from z  cma at pa @xmath46 .",
    "the radio counterpart of the outflow was also detected in co lines @xcite and in the thermal jet @xcite , both oriented coincident with the optical jet . in the latter case , the high angular resolution of the vla observations allowed for the first time to clearly identify the origin of the outflow with the se ( fu  ori ) binary component .",
    "understanding the shape of the jet - blown cavity and the amount of swept - up dust could constrain the momentum profile of the bipolar winds , testing current theories for such winds and the generation of jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ jetfig ] also indicates the direction of the previously known optical jet and bipolar outflow at pa=@xmath46 .",
    "if the near - infrared feature arises from light scattering off dust swept - up into a thin shell surrounding a jet - blown cavity , we would expect features on either side of the jet direction ( as is also indicated in figure  [ jetfig ] ) and both should be ( more - or - less ) static .",
    "however , we do not see any evidence for symmetrical emission on the other side of the optical jet , casting doubt on this hypothesis . on the other hand",
    ", the high level of spurious emission may be masking this feature , and even higher dynamic - range observations are needed before this interpretation can be ruled out .",
    "alternatively , the emission may be directly associated with a different or new jet , given its morphology and association with known accretion objects . if the feature is moving with typical jet velocities ( e.g. , 500 km / s , poetzel  et  al .",
    "1989 ) , then proper motions of the jet feature of up to 100  au per year ( @xmath47 mas per year ) are expected and should be readily detectable within a short time - span , in contrast to the previous hypothesis .",
    "unfortunately , due to the psf artifacts in these first images , the new feature can not be followed close enough to the central binary to establish whether or not it is associated with one of the components , and higher signal - to - noise at close separations plus optimum placement of the feature with respect to the psf artifacts may be able resolve this issue .",
    "we have detected a new jet - like feature in the close environment of the young stellar binary z  cma .",
    "the feature extends about 1035  au from the central binary , in the s - sw direction , and has a width of about 115  au . a symmetric feature to the other side of the known optical jet and bipolar outflow",
    "is expected but not detected , and therefore further targeted observations are required to establish whether this new feature is indeed associated with the bipolar outflow ( e.g. scattering off dust in its inner walls ) or constitutes an independent jet .",
    "our high resolution observations have also revealed for the first time orbital motion in the zcma system , as well as further established the high degree of flux variability of its individual components .",
