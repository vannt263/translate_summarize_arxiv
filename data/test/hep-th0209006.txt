    "a neutrino propagating in matter do not longer respect the vacuum energy momentum relation .",
    "the modification of the neutrino dispersion relation is caused by their coherent interaction with the particles in the background and can be accounted in terms of an index of refraction @xcite or an effective potential @xcite .",
    "the topic of neutrino propagation in matter became of prime relevance after wolfenstein @xcite study of the neutrino refractive index in matter , and later when mikheyev - smirnov @xcite recognized the resonant neutrino flavor oscillations triggered by matter effects .",
    "the mikheyev - smirnov effect has become the most popular explanation of the solar neutrino deficit @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the neutrino dispersion relation is a complex function @xmath0 . according to the thermal field theory ( tft )",
    "matter contributions to the real and imaginary parts of @xmath1 arise from the temperature and density - dependent part of the neutrino self - energy . to leading order in @xmath2",
    "the real part of the dispersion relation is proportional to the particle - antiparticle asymmetry in the background .",
    "if the asymmetry is small or zero the imaginary part of @xmath3 and corrections of order @xmath4 to the real part may be important because they do not depend on the differences between the number of particles and antiparticles",
    ". this may be the case in the early universe , when the medium was probably nearly cp - symmetric .",
    "special attention has been given to the calculations of the @xmath5 corrections to the real part of the neutrino dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "within the framework of the tft these corrections arise from the momentum - dependent terms of the boson propagator in the self - energy diagrams .    the imaginary part of the index of refraction for neutrinos propagating in a cp - symmetric plasma composed of electrons , neutrinos and their anti - particles has been considered in references @xcite .",
    "these calculations have been based upon the computation of the neutrino reaction rates , assuming massless background fermions . in our opinion",
    "the relation of the neutrino damping rate to the self - energy discontinuties deserves further consideration .",
    "additionally this work addresses the effects of the nucleons background contributions and the fermion mass correction .",
    "a systematic method to compute the damping rate from the imaginary part of the self energy can be formulated in terms of the cuttosky thermal rules .",
    "weldon @xcite and kobes @xcite proved that the imaginary part of the self energy can be organized in a form that includes square of amplitudes of the various processes obtained from the cuts of the self energy and weighted with the appropriated statistical factors .",
    "the examples discussed in those papers are always at the one loop level .",
    "as it shall be discussed , the calculation of the neutrino damping rate require to consider the self energy at the two loop level , the interpretation in terms of square of amplitudes of the allowed processes will be proved to remain valid .",
    "the approximations required to recover the results obtained from the optical theorem will be clearly stated .    in this work",
    "we use the method of real - time thermal field theory to carry out a carefully calculation of the imaginary part of the neutrino dispersion relation in a medium composed of electrons , protons , neutrons , neutrinos and their anti - particles . as already mentioned the contributions to the imaginary part of the neutrino self - energy vanishes at the one loop level ,",
    "so we have to consider the contributions at the two loops level .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review those ingredients of the ftf formalism that are required to accomplish our calculations .",
    "in section [ real part ] we re - derive the real part of the dispersion relation of a massless neutrino that propagate in a thermal background .",
    "we prove that utilizing the methods of finite -temperature field theory ( at the @xmath6 order ) , the neutrino effective potential reduces to the thermal average of neutrino forward scattering amplitude .",
    "the calculation of the imaginary part of the dispersion relation is presented in section [ imaginary part ] .",
    "the neutrino damping rate is extracted from the discontinuity of self - energy at the two loop level , it is expressed in terms of integrals over space phase of amplitudes squared , weighted with statistical factors that account for the possibility of particle absorption or emission from the medium . specific results for a background composed of neutrinos , leptons , protons and neutrons are given .",
    "the last section contains a summary of our main results .",
    "the relevant quantity is the self - energy @xmath7 , which embodies the effects of the background on a neutrino that propagates through it . according to the real - time formalism of the tft @xcite , the real and imaginary part of @xmath7",
    "are given by the formulas @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( a , b = 1,2 ) are the complex elements of the @xmath11 self - energy matrix to be computed utilizing the feynman rules of the theory .",

    "are @xmath22 .    in the presence of a medium the chiral nature of the neutrino interactions",
    "implies that the self - energy of a massless ( left - handed ) neutrino is of the form @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 are complex functions of the scalars    @xmath27    in this case , the dirac equation for the spinor @xmath28 of the neutrino mode in the medium is @xmath29 which has non - trivial solutions only for those values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 such that @xmath32 , with @xmath33 .",
    "then , the dispersion relations @xmath34 of the neutrino and antineutrino modes are obtained as the solutions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37    in general , the solutions @xmath34 are complex , as usual we write @xmath38 where both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are real functions of @xmath31 .",
    "a consistent interpretation in terms of the dispersion relation for a mode propagating through a medium is possible only if the imaginary part of @xmath41 is small compared to its real part . in this case",
    "the mode can be visualized as a particle ( or antiparticle ) with an energy @xmath42 and a damping @xmath43 . under such assumptions , each one of eqs .",
    "( [ ein8 ] ) and ( [ ein9 ] ) yields two distinct solutions , one with positive energy and the other with negative energy , whose physical interpretation has been discussed in detail in ref @xcite . here",

    "it is convenient to make the decompositions @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "( [ ein12 ] ) are known @xcite . at the one - loop level",
    "both @xmath51 and @xmath52 are of order @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , to this order the energy of a massless neutrino is @xmath54 on the other hand , as we will show , the imaginary part of @xmath7 vanish to @xmath55 and to this order there are not contributions to @xmath56 . for the perturbative solution of eq .",
    "( [ ein13 ] ) around @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 with @xmath59 of @xmath60 .",
    "the matter effects on the neutrino oscillations are conveniently incorporated by means of the effective potential @xmath61 .",
    "this can be introduced by subtracting the ( vacuum ) kinetic energy from the real part of the neutrino dispersion relation@xcite : @xmath62 in the literature it is also customary to use a refraction index , which is defined by @xmath63 in the approximation we are working on , and utilizing eqs .",
    "( [ ein11]-[ein17 ] ) , it follows that its real and imaginary parts are related to the effective potential and the damping rate by @xmath64 with @xmath61 and @xmath43 given by equations ( [ ein17 ] ) and ( [ ein16 ] ) , respectively .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ ein17 ] ) , for a perturbative solutions of the dispersion relation around the vacuum value @xmath57 , the effective potential is given by the real part of the coefficient of @xmath65 in the neutrino self - energy .",
    "this is only true in the lowest order , in general , @xmath61 will also receive contributions from @xmath66 . from eq .",
    "( [ ein5 ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath67 with @xmath68 in ref .",
    "@xcite the real part of the neutrino self - energy was calculated in a general gauge up to terms of order @xmath69 .",
    "it was shown , that although the self - energy depends on the gauge parameter , the dispersion relation is independent of it . taking this result into account ,",
    "for simplicity we will work in the unitary gauge .",
    "furthermore , for physical situations where the temperature is much lower than the masses of the gauge bosons , the propagators for the @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be taken the same as in the vacuum , namely , @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "we shall assume that neutrinos are massless , so at the one - loop level the only contributions to @xmath7 arise from the diagrams depicted in fig",
    ". 1 .    for a neutrino @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) that propagates through a medium with a momentum @xmath76 ,",
    "we split the different contributions to @xmath77 according to the processes in fig . 1 as follows :    @xmath78    corresponding to the tadpole , z - exchange , and w - exchange contributions .",
    "in this case , the background dependent parts of each term in the right hand side of the previous equation can be worked out as @xmath79 in @xmath80 the charged lepton in the internal line has the same flavor that @xmath74 , while in the tadpole contribution @xmath81 the summation is over all the fermion species present in the thermal background . in the previous expressions the vertices are given by @xmath82 with the vector @xmath83 and axial couplings @xmath84 given for the charged leptons by @xmath85 for the neutrinos by @xmath86 and for the nucleons by @xmath87    according to eq .",
    "( [ ein17 ] ) @xmath88 has to be evaluated at @xmath89 , in this case the quantity @xmath90 in ( [ ep2 ] ) reduces to the energy projector for a massless particle in the vacuum @xmath91 , and may be replaced by its usual expression in terms of the free spinors . in general for the external lines the spinors to be used are the solutions of the dirac equation in the medium @xcite .",
    "however , within the approximation we are using , they can be approximated by the vacuum solutions . for the internal fermionic lines we substitute @xmath92 by its corresponding energy projector .",
