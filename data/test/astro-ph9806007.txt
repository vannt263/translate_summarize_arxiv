    "the dearth of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) between @xmath0 and @xmath1  hr is well known as the cv period gap .",
    "the conventional explanation of this ( see e.g. king , 1988 ; kolb , 1996 ; ritter , 1996 for reviews ) invokes the idea that mass transfer on a timescale shorter than the secondary s thermal time will cause this star to be larger than its thermal  equilibrium radius .",
    "if there is a sudden drop in the orbital braking once the secondary becomes fully convective , it is plausible that a gap of the observed width results .",
    "the lack of a cogent predictive theory of the braking mechanism for cvs above the gap means that no explanation of this kind can be totally compelling .",
    "however , the interrupted  braking picture does naturally explain several features such as the sharpness of the gap sides , and ( to some extent ) the distributions of various cv subtypes across it .",
    "it has shown remarkable resilience in withstanding various alternative suggestions ( e.g. livio & pringle , 1994  see king & kolb , 1995 ) .",
    "in a recent paper , clemens et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter c98 ) suggest another alternative theory for the formation of the gap .",
    "this is based on a proposed revision of the mass  radius relation for the lower main sequence , as derived from colour  magnitude diagrams of nearby stars ( reid & gizis , 1997 ) . c98",
    "derive radii and masses using bolometric corrections and the temperature scale from leggett et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and an empirical mass  magnitude relation ( henry & mccarthy , 1993 ) .",
    "c98 then assume that cv secondaries do not significantly deviate from this equilibrium mass  radius relation .",
    "thus the effective mass  radius index = [ zeta ] ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 are the donor mass and radius ) along the evolution above and through the period gap region must always equal the local equilibrium index of the main sequence . in c98",
    "s interpretation , @xmath4 takes values close to 1/3 in two different sections of the main sequence . any range of secondary masses @xmath3 with @xmath5 maps on to a single binary period",
    "( see eqs .",
    "( [ p ] ) , ( [ pdot ] ) below ) , in this case to about 3.4  hr and 2.0  hr . c98 show that this gives a rather slow evolution in period at these two points , and claim that this reproduces the cv period gap .",
    "we shall not comment on c98 s interpretation of these data , except to say that it is certainly not the only possible one .",
    "our main point is to take issue with c98 s conclusion that their revision allows an alternative explanation for the period gap .",
    "we shall show that , far from producing a period gap , this revision in fact produces a pair of period ` spikes ' at 3.4  hr and 2.0  hr .",
    "the cv discovery probability between these two spikes is no lower than outside them .",
    "we derive the condition for a mass  radius relation to produce a gap , and point out that this is very unlikely to be satisfied by any thermal  equilibrium mass  radius relation .",
    "finally we briefly consider the argument by verbunt ( 1997 ) questioning the reality of the period gap .",
    "roche geometry allows one to express the orbital period change in terms of @xmath4 .",
    "the secondary s roche lobe radius can be approximated as r_l = c(m_2m)^1/3a [ rl ] ( paczyski , 1971 ) , where @xmath6 is the total binary mass , @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the binary separation . combining this with kepler s",
    "3rd law shows that the binary period is given by p ( r_l^3 m_2)^1/2 .",
    "[ p ] from ( [ zeta ] ) we have = , [ r2dot ] hence with ( [ p ] ) for the rate of change of period = 3 - 1 2m_2m_2 . [ pdot ]",
    "we thus see that @xmath9 vanishes where @xmath5 .",
    "the binary evolves in response to the loss of orbital angular momentum @xmath10 .",
    "this may occur through gravitational radiation or other processes , e.g. magnetic braking . with primary mass @xmath11",
    "we can write j = m_1m_2(gam)^1/2 .",
    "[ j ] in the following we shall assume that all the mass lost by the secondary is accreted by the primary , so that the total binary mass remains fixed , i.e. @xmath12 . then logarithmically differentiating ( [ rl ] , [ j ] ) gives = 2jj - 2m_2m_2(56 - m_2m_1 ) .",
    "[ rldot ] for stationary mass transfer ( i.e. @xmath13 ) the roche lobe and stellar radius must move in step , i.e. @xmath14 . with ( [ r2dot ] ) and ( [ rldot ] ) this gives the mass transfer rate as = j / j5/6 + /2 - m_2/m_1 .",
    "[ mdot ] the denominator of this equation is automatically positive if we require mass transfer stability , i.e. that in the absence of angular momentum losses the roche lobe would expand away from the star ( @xmath15 ) in response to mass transfer .",
    "this follows from setting @xmath16 in ( [ rldot ] ) and comparing with ( [ r2dot ] ) , and in general requires that the mass ratio @xmath17 should be @xmath18 .",
    "thus , specifying @xmath19 in some way , the binary evolution is fixed .",
    "in particular we can express the mass transfer rate @xmath20 and period derivative @xmath9 as functions of the secondary mass @xmath3 .",
    "the probability @xmath21 of discovering the system in a given range of @xmath22 will vary as p(p ) [ p ] , where @xmath23 is some positive power . for a bolometrically flux ",
    "limited sample drawn from an isotropically distributed population we have @xmath24 .",
    "law fits to the bolometric correction show that @xmath25 is appropriate for a visual magnitude  limited ( @xmath26limited ) sample ( see below ) , and indeed this value gives a better fit to the observed distribution in the conventional picture ( kolb 1996 ) .    from ( [ pdot ] , [ mdot ] )",
    "we get p(p ) m_2^|jj|^- 1(3- 1)^-1(56 + 2 - m_2m_1)^1 - .",
    "[ p(m ) ] for the particular choices @xmath24 and @xmath27 we have p(p ) m_2 ^ 3/2|jj|^1/2(3- 1)^-1(56 + 2 - m_2m_1)^-1/2 [ 3/2 ] and p(p ) . [ 1 ]",
    "the last three equations show us the effect of any choice @xmath28 on the discovery probability , which is the quantity predicting the cv period histogram . since in general @xmath3 and @xmath29 are smooth functions through the evolution , the character of the predicted histogram is controlled by @xmath4 .",
    "the choice of @xmath28 given by c98 has @xmath30 for secondary mass ranges which translate to periods 3.4 and 2.0  hr . but from ( [ p(m ) ] ) we see that this actually makes @xmath31 at these two points rather than reducing @xmath32 towards zero between them , as required for a period gap .",
    "[ pdista ] shows @xmath21 for the case @xmath33 , evaluated directly from ( [ p ] ) with @xmath20 and @xmath34 from c98 . as can be seen",
    ", this does not give a period gap at all , but two spikes .",
    "the small period derivative at @xmath35  hr raises the discovery probability dramatically there , as the systems spend a long time near this period without being particularly faint there .",
    "a similar but weaker effect is seen at @xmath36  hr . note that the discovery probability between the two spikes is _ not _ lower than that outside them .",
    "the case @xmath24 ( eq . [ 3/2 ] ) gives similar results , but with even larger spikes .",
    "neither of these distributions looks at all like the observed one ( see fig .",
    "[ obs ] below ) , which has roughly equal numbers above and below the gap , with approximately uniform distributions in @xmath22 in each case .",
    "the disagreement with observation is even worse for @xmath37 .",
    "the discovery probability ( [ p ] ) refers to a particular cv system at period @xmath38 with current mass transfer rate @xmath39 and corresponding period derivative @xmath9 .",
    "the observed period histogram however represents a sample of systems selected from the present  day galactic cv population according to certain selection effects .",
    "thus the sample comprises systems with different ages at different evolutionary stages . in the next section",
    "we make use of the population synthesis technique developed by kolb ( 1993 ) and de  kool ( 1992 ) to synthesize a theoretical observable period distribution in the framework of a given evolutionary model for cvs .",
    "the key element in this procedure is to enforce the mass  radius relation as claimed by c98 on the lower main sequence . as we will see",
    "the resulting period distribution does indeed show similar spikes as the discovery probability in fig .",
    "[ pdista ] , and no gap .",
    "cvs are believed to form from a subset of zero  age binaries with a low  mass companion which undergo a common envelope ( ce ) phase ( see e.g.  de  kool 1992 , politano 1996 ) .",
    "the ce evolution tightens the orbit and exposes the white dwarf core of the giant primary .",
    "orbital angular momentum losses @xmath19 further shrink the orbit of the post  ce binary until the secondary fills its roche lobe . the subsequent semi ",
    "detached evolution is governed by @xmath19 and the secondary s response @xmath4 to mass loss , as outlined in sect .  2 .",
    "the method for obtaining a full theoretical period histogram has been described extensively by kolb ( 1993 ) .",
    "chiefly , there are three main steps involved : first , to calculate the time  dependent formation rate of nascent cvs , e.g.  as a function of initial white dwarf and donor mass , for given formation rate and distributions of primary mass , mass ratio and orbital separation of zero  age binaries .",
    "second , to evolve this nascent population into its present  day configuration .",
    "the resulting multi - dimensional distribution function defines the intrinsic present  day galactic cv population .",
    "third , selection effects have to be defined which determine how the observable sample is drawn from the intrinsic population .    in c98 s attempt to explain the cv period gap the nature of the angular momentum loss @xmath19 is irrelevant as long as it is continuous and smooth along the evolution .",
    "obviously , for a population synthesis we have to specify @xmath19 .",
    "we adopt the simplest choice for a continuous @xmath19 and assume that it is given by the emission of gravitational waves only . for this case the time ",
    "dependent cv fomation rate has already been calculated by kolb & de  kool ( 1993 ) , using a monte carlo technique ( see also de  kool 1992 ) . in their simulations the primary and secondary of zero  age binaries form independently from a miller & scalo type imf ( miller & scalo 1979 ) , the distribution of initial orbital separations @xmath8 is flat in @xmath40 , and the common envelope efficiency is 1 .    to calculate the secular evolution of cvs we use a simplified stellar structure code that describes the donor s radiative core ( if present ) as a polytrope with index @xmath41 , the donor s convective envelope as a polytrope with index @xmath42 .",
    "the bipolytrope model has two free parameters , the core index @xmath41 and a discontinuity @xmath43 of the specific entropy at the stellar surface ( see kolb & ritter 1992 ) .",
    "we calibrate these parameters as a function of donor mass ( fig .",
    "[ cal ] ) in such a way that the corresponding ( bi)polytrope models in thermal equilibrium reproduce the c98 mass  radius relation to better than @xmath44 in the range @xmath45 . for larger masses",
    "we used the same calibration as in kolb & ritter ( 1992 ) , for smaller masses a calibration which reproduces the cv minimum period at @xmath46  mins . to mimic the effect of nova outbursts we invoke an isotropic wind from the white dwarf , which removes the transferred material with the primary s specific orbital angular momentum from the system .",
    "we note that this stellar evolution code self  consistently takes into account the donor s deviation from thermal equilibrium as a result of mass transfer , i.e.  does not force @xmath4 to be _ equal _ to the equilibrium index along an evolutionary sequence . as @xmath19 is rather weak",
    "the actual deviations are of course small .      in fig .",
    "[ popsyn ] we plot the period histogram @xmath47 of a @xmath26limited sample taken from the resulting intrisic model population . to do",
    "so we neglected the drop of the cv space density perpendicular to the galactic plane and assumed that the visual light comes from an optically thick , steady - state accretion disc . in this case the integration of the intrinsic space density distribution over the observable volume can be approximated by a multiplication with the differential selection factor @xmath48 ( cf .",
    "kolb 1993 , kolb 1996 ) .    as expected , the period distribution in fig .",
    "[ popsyn ] shows two pronounced peaks at @xmath49  hr and @xmath50  hr .",
    "the population density @xmath51 between these spikes is not lower than outside of them , i.e.there is no gap .",
    "the drop of @xmath51 for @xmath52  hr is from a drop in the formation rate at larger donor mass , and is also seen in the period distribution obtained by kolb & de  kool ( 1993 ) with the more conventional underlying main  sequence mass  radius exponent @xmath53  constant .",
    "the third spike at the minimum period @xmath54  hr occurs for the same reason as the other two spikes , i.e.  because @xmath55 .",
    "it indicates the transition from the lower main sequence to the brown dwarf regime where @xmath56 .",
    "it is well  known that the observed period histogram ( fig  [ obs ] ) has no such spike at the lower period cut  off .",
    "this suggests that additional selection effects prevent us from detecting these extremely low  mass donor cvs .",
    "changing the exponents of @xmath11 and @xmath39 in @xmath57 , as would be appropriate for samples that are not purely @xmath26 limited , does not alter the qualitatitive features of the resulting period histogram .",
    "hence the detailed population synthesis fully confirms the expectations from the functional of the discovery probability ( [ p(m ) ] ) : the mass  radius relation claimed by c98 does generate a gap in the period distribution of cvs .    from ( [ p(m ) ] ) it is easy to see that a real period gap  a region where @xmath21 is low or zero  requires a very large effective @xmath4 .",
    "this in turn means that we require the secondary s radius to change significantly for a very small change of its mass .",
    "this is indeed precisely what happens in the conventional explanation of the gap : @xmath2 shrinks from a non  equilibrium value towards the main  sequence radius appropriate to the secondary s current mass @xmath3 , with _ no _ change in the latter . since @xmath58 this radius change implies that the period must change if the star is to fill its roche lobe , and thus transfer mass .",
    "it is hard to see how any revision of the _ equilibrium _ mass  radius relation , as proposed by c98 , could have the required property of producing a very large @xmath4 for systems in the period gap .",
    "the fact that features of the function @xmath28 describing the lower main sequence should reappear as a moderate anomaly in the observed period histogram was already noted by kolb ( 1993 ) .",
    "the theoretical main sequence has a well  established hump in @xmath28 in the mass range @xmath59 , caused by the dissociation of @xmath60 molecules in the outermost stellar layers .",
    "this should produce a characteristic plateau and shoulder in @xmath21 at @xmath61  hr .",
    "this period range is not shown in fig .",
    "[ obs ] ; the data are still too sparse at these periods to confirm the reality of this feature .",
    "we have so far assumed that the period gap is genuine . verbunt ( 1997 )",
    "argues that that this may not be the case , essentially because not all cv subtypes show a significant gap .",
    "in particular , almost all ( non - magnetic ) novalike systems have periods above the gap , while dwarf novae populate both sides of it .",
    "verbunt concedes that the period gap is statistically significant for the dwarf novae , but he argues that the gap might not be significant if one broke up the dwarf novae into subtypes such as the su uma and u gem systems .",
    "almost all of the su uma systems are below the gap , the u gem systems above ( for the period distribution of all cv subtypes see the catalogue of ritter & kolb , 1998 ) .    a critical re  evaluation of verbunt s arguments has already been given by hellier & naylor ( 1998 ) .",
    "they convincingly dismissed his classification of vy scl stars with dwarf novae and pointed out the importance of treating magnetic systems separately for a comparison of dwarf novae and novalike systems . here",
    "we add to this by emphasizing that verbunt s argument actually works positively in favour of the conventional theoretical framework of the explanation of the period gap . for the most basic feature of this explanation",
    "is that average mass transfer rates above the gap should be significantly higher than those below .",
    "thus below the gap we expect that these rates will be too low to ensure the stability of the accretion discs in non  magnetic systems , since the disc edge will be too cool to keep hydrogen ionized ( cf kolb , 1996 ) .",
    "the prevalence of dwarf novae below the period gap is thus a natural consequence of the interrupted  braking picture and disc instability models ( see e.g.  meyer  hofmeister & ritter , 1993 , for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "the coexistence of dwarf novae and novalike ( steady ) systems at similar periods above the gap shows that there is evidently a range of mass transfer rates at a given period .",
    "the origin of this range is unclear , but it may result from long  term cycles of the mass transfer rate about the secular mean , possibly caused by the weak irradiation of the secondary star by the primary ( cf king et al . , 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "the mean mass transfer rates below the gap are so far below the critical rate for disc instability that such fluctuations evidently have amplitudes too small to produce many steady systems below the gap . however above the gap the mean transfer rate and the critical rate are quite close ( cf kolb , 1996 ) , so the fluctuations can carry systems across the latter .",
    "thus both outbursting ( dwarf nova ) and persistent ( novalike ) cvs are found above the gap .",
    "more generally , since the mass transfer rate @xmath20 and the mass ratio @xmath17 are the two most important parameters characterizing the immediate appearance of a given cv system , it would be surprising if the explanations for various types of cv behaviour did _ not _ involve them .",
    "since both quantities are systematically smaller below the gap than above , one would thus expect a preference for one side of the gap or the other for various subtypes , as is actually seen in dwarf novae .    in any case",
    ", verbunt s argument can not be regarded as compelling , since it signally fails to provide a reason other than unspecified `` selection effects '' for the very strongly significant presence of a period gap when one takes the full set of systems in which a white dwarf accretes from a low  mass companion , i.e. the full cv sample : compare fig .",
    "we conclude that the conventional explanation of the cv period gap in terms of interrupted orbital braking is still the most plausible . in conjunction with other ideas , such as the disc instability picture ,",
    "it offers a simple framework for understanding the period distributions of the various cv subtypes .",
    "this can not be said of any proposed alternative ."
