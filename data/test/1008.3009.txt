    "rhythmic elements are basic building blocks of nature at human scales .",
    "they play particularly important roles in the functioning of biological systems , such as cardiac muscle cells , pacemaker neurons , and animals or plants following circadian or circannual rhythms .",
    "recently , synchronization among non - interacting rhythmic elements induced by common fluctuating external force has attracted much attention in diverse fields .",
    "it has been demonstrated for a wide class of rhythmic elements ranging from lasers and electronic circuits to biological systems  @xcite .",
    "for example , reliable synchronous response of neurons due to common or shared input signals has been actively discussed in neuroscience  @xcite . in ecology , it is known that , due to common climate fluctuations , populations of plants exhibit large - scale synchronized flowering and production of seed crops also fluctuate synchronously from year to year  @xcite , and such phenomena are generally termed the `` moran effect ''  @xcite .    we often characterize a rhythmic element as a limit - cycle oscillator .",
    "populations of coupled limit - cycle oscillators show a variety of interesting collective behavior , including mutual synchronization , wave propagation , and chaos  @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that uncoupled limit - cycle oscillators can mutually synchronize when they are driven by common impulses  @xcite .",
    "the simplest classical situation is , of course , synchronization due to phase locking of an oscillator to common periodic impulses  @xcite .",
    "another interesting situation is noise - induced synchronization as mentioned above , caused e.g. by common random poisson impulses  @xcite .",

    "this prompts the question , what is the difference between the synchronization due to phase locking and noise - induced synchronization ? though drive - response configuration of the impulse source and the oscillators is the same for both cases ,",
    "it is expected that there should be some difference in their synchronization dynamics , reflecting different characteristics of the driving impulses . in this paper",
    ", we address this issue by considering uncoupled limit - cycle oscillators driven by gamma impulses , which can be smoothly interpolated between regular periodic and random poisson impulses .",
    "we examine the transition from phase locking to noise - induced synchronization as the statistics of the gamma impulses is varied , and quantify their difference using phase distributions , lyapunov exponents , and information - theoretic measures .",

    "section  vii summarizes the results .",
    "in this section , we introduce phase oscillators driven by common gamma impulses and demonstrate their synchronization dynamics .      based on the standard phase reduction theory of limit cycles  @xcite",
    ", we can describe a limit - cycle oscillator using only its phase variable , @xmath0 , defined along its stable limit cycle provided that the intervals between the impulses are sufficiently longer than the amplitude relaxation time of the oscillator state to the limit - cycle orbit .",
    "the key quantity for this description is the phase response curve ( prc ) @xmath1 of the oscillator  @xcite , which encapsulates its dynamical properties .",
    "@xmath1 is a periodic function on @xmath2 that gives asymptotic response of the oscillator phase to an impulsive perturbation given at phase @xmath3 .",
    "it has been measured experimentally , e.g. , for repetitively firing neurons  @xcite .",
    "when the limit - cycle oscillator is kicked by an impulse at phase @xmath3 , the phase is mapped to a new value @xmath4 .",
    "this function @xmath5 is sometimes called the `` phase transition curve '' in the literature .",
    "the dynamics of the oscillator between two successive impulses consists of a jump caused by the first impulse and subsequent free rotation until the arrival of the second impulse  @xcite .",
    "the oscillator is also subject to small temporal fluctuations of various origins .",
    "we assume that each oscillator receives common driving impulses at times @xmath6 , and denote the phase of the oscillator just before the @xmath7th impulse by @xmath8 .",
    "the effect of the @xmath7th impulse is to map the oscillator phase @xmath9 to @xmath10 . to incorporate the effect of small fluctuations",
    ", we also apply a weak additive independent noise @xmath11 before the mapping . the phase @xmath12 just after the @xmath7th impulse is thus given by @xmath13 . after receiving the @xmath7th impulse",
    ", the oscillator rotates with a constant frequency until @xmath14 at which the @xmath15th impulse arrives .",
    "therefore , the phase @xmath16 just before the @xmath15th impulse is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the inter - impulse interval , @xmath19 is the frequency of the oscillator , and we have taken modulo @xmath20 of the phase to confine it in @xmath2 . since @xmath21 and @xmath11 are random variables , this equation gives a random map , which we will call a `` random phase map '' hereafter .",
    "when we consider multiple oscillators , @xmath22 is common to all oscillators , whereas @xmath23 is different from oscillator to oscillator .",
    "note that @xmath11 represents small temporal fluctuations of the dynamics of oscillators , but not static heterogeneities in their natural frequencies .",
    "mean frequency of the driven oscillator exhibits qualitatively different dependence on the driving impulse between phase locking and noise - induced synchronization , as we show in sec .",
    "iv .    as the simplest and typical example",
    ", we assume that the prc is given by a sinusoidal function @xmath24 in the following numerical analysis , so that the phase map is given by @xmath25 the parameter @xmath26 controls the magnitude of the nonlinearity , which may also be regarded as the intensity of the impulse . such a prc with both positive and negative lobes",
    "are called type - ii  @xcite , which generally arises near the hopf bifurcation of limit - cycle oscillators  @xcite .",
    "another typical example is the type - i prc with a single positive lobe , e.g. @xmath27 , which generally arises near the snic ( saddle - node on invariant circle ) bifurcation of oscillators  @xcite .",
    "however , difference between these two prcs can roughly be eliminated by simply shifting the frequency @xmath19 and the origin of the phase @xmath3 in the present setup , and qualitatively similar results are expected for both prcs .",
    "actually , the two types of prcs yielded almost the same results in our numerical analysis .",
    "thus , the type - ii prc , eq .",

    "the mean value is fixed at @xmath31 . ]",
    "we consider driving impulses that have `` intermediate '' statistics between regular periodic impulses and random poisson impulses . as such impulses ,",
    "we adopt the gamma impulses  @xcite , whose inter - impulse interval @xmath32 obeys the gamma distribution  @xcite , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are real positive parameters .",
    "the mean interval is given by @xmath36 .",
    "the gamma distribution has the following properties .",
    "firstly , when @xmath37 , @xmath38 gives an exponential distribution , @xmath39 which means that the impulses obey the standard poisson random process .",
    "secondly , by taking the limit @xmath40 and @xmath41 with @xmath42 fixed , the gamma distribution approaches the delta function , @xmath43 in this limit , the inter - impulse interval is always @xmath44 , so that the impulses become periodic .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath34 , which we call a shape parameter , determines the property of the gamma impulses as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] . by varying the value of @xmath34 between @xmath20 and @xmath45 with",
    "@xmath46 fixed , the gamma impulses can exhibit intermediate properties between random poisson and regular periodic impulses while keeping the same mean inter - impulse interval .",
    "we examine uncoupled oscillators driven by gamma impulses and see how synchronization dynamics of the oscillators depends on the shape parameter @xmath34 in the following .",
    "the gamma distribution has several nice mathematical properties and naturally arises under a few simple assumptions when the mean and the irregularity of impulse sequences , which respectively correspond to the mean interval @xmath47 and the shape parameter @xmath34  @xcite , are given .",
    "we thus use the gamma impulses in the present paper , though alternative approaches for varying the regularity of the driving signal should also be possible , e.g. , by using chaotic dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "we here demonstrate synchronization of uncoupled oscillators induced by common impulses for the periodic , poisson , and intermediate cases by direct numerical simulations .",

    "( [ pm ] ) at @xmath48 throughout our numerical simulations , which is sufficiently small and therefore the map is not chaotic even for strictly periodic impulses .",
    "this is because we are focusing on the synchronization dynamics of limit cycles ( note that the sinusoidal type ii phase map with periodic impulses is nothing but the well - known circle map  @xcite ) .",
    "strong poisson impulses may also yield positive lyapunov exponents and lead to desynchronization of oscillators as shown in ref .",
