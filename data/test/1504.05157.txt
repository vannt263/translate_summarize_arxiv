    "the precise shape of the quark - gluon vertex plays an essential role in the understanding of many important properties of the infrared behavior of qcd @xcite .",
    "this vertex is in particular fundamental in the analysis of the origin of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the context of truncated dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equations .",
    "indeed , the ds equation for the quark self - energy requires the knowledge of this vertex , together with the gluon two - point vertex function .",
    "even if this kind of object depends on the gauge - fixing , one expects that the gauge - invariant physical content of the theory is encoded on its behavior .",
    "for example , the meson spectrum can be studied by injecting such vertices and two - point functions in appropriate bethe - salpeter equations , see for example @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "the determination of the quark - gluon vertex has been a topic of intensive work in the past .",
    "it has been first studied in the perturbative domain .",
    "a general parametrization based on its symmetries and a one - loop calculation of the abelian part in feynman gauge was performed in @xcite .",
    "some years later , the complete one loop calculation in an arbitrary linear covariant gauge and in arbitrary dimension was performed in @xcite ( where previous partial results are reviewed also ) .",
    "more recently the complete 2-loop off - shell calculation has been performed in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these perturbative studies lead to a satisfactory description of this vertex at high momenta . however , the infrared sector , which is of direct interest for the understanding of chiral symmetry breaking , is not accessible to perturbation theory . to cope with problem ,",
    "mainly two methods have been used : lattice simulations and ds equations .    in both of these approaches ,",
    "the most convenient gauge is the landau gauge . from the lattice simulation side ,",
    "it is well - adapted because the gauge - fixing operation can be expressed in terms of an extremization , which can be implemented efficiently on the lattice . from the analytic side , this gauge has several advantages .",
    "first , it is a linear gauge condition that manifestly preserves lorentz invariance .",
    "second , among all linear covariant gauges , it is the only one that includes the symmetries of the curci - ferrari gauge @xcite .",
    "this implies , in particular , the existence of some non - renormalization theorems , that simplify considerably the algebraic work @xcite .",
    "third , in this gauge , the gluon propagator is transverse .",
    "consequently , only the vertices where the gluon lines are multiplied by transverse projectors contribute to the correlation functions .",
    "accordingly , all consideration below will be done in this gauge fixing .",
    "there have been many analysis of the infrared behavior of the quark - gluon vertex based in the study of truncated ds equations ( for a review , see @xcite ; for more recent work on the subject , see @xcite ) . in parallel the intermediate and infrared regime of the vertex has been studied by lattice simulations .",
    "many tensorial components have been analyzed @xcite for some particular configuration of momenta .",
    "moreover , for the tensorial component that is already present at bare level , which is expected to be `` dominant '' , more general configurations of momenta have been considered @xcite .    in continuum analytical approaches , the gauge fixing is generally implemented through the faddeev - popov construction , which is a perfectly valid procedure in the ultraviolet regime , where standard perturbation theory works well and where the faddeev - popov construction is well justified . however , for momenta smaller or of the order of 1 gev ( which is the typical energy scale of the strong interaction ) this procedure is not fully justified .",
    "the standard lore is that it becomes inappropriate because the coupling grows and perturbation theory eventually becomes a very bad approximation scheme .",
    "this argument must be tempered because the real expansion parameter of qcd is of the order of @xmath1 and because lattice simulations , at least in some renormalization schemes , indicate that this parameter remains moderate ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly it is reasonable to believe that some sort of perturbation theory should give results that are in qualitative agreement with experiments or lattice simulations in that regime .",
    "there is , however , another reason why standard perturbation theory should become inappropriate in the infrared regime : the faddeev - popov procedure itself becomes questionable .",
    "this originates in the existence of gribov copies @xcite in covariant gauge - fixings of non - abelian gauge theories that are ignored in the faddeev - popov construction .",
    "these copies play no significant role in the ultraviolet regime but a systematic treatment of the associated ambiguity remains an open problem in the infrared .",
    "the most developed procedure which aims at taking into account the effects of gribov copies is probably the gribov - zwanziger ( gz ) construction @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this approach is to restrict the functional integral to the first gribov region where the faddeev - popov operator is positive definite .",
    "gribov showed that in this region there are no copies that are an infinitesimal transformation of one another .",
    "unfortunately it was shown later that there are _ finite _ gauge transformations that preserve the landau condition @xcite .",
    "consequently the gz procedure does not remove all copies .",
    "moreover , the implementation of the restriction of the functional integral to the first gribov region is not completely justified from first principles .    despite these difficulties , first studies of",
    "the gz predicted that the gluon propagator would vanish at zero momentum , instead of diverging as in the bare theory .",
    "a similar behavior was found also as solutions of truncated ds equations @xcite and in non - perturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) calculations @xcite ( for a general review on this formalism , see @xcite ) .",
    "this kind of solution is called `` scaling solution '' .",
    "the suppression of the gluon propagator was rapidly confirmed by lattice simulations . however , when lattice simulations became more precise they showed that the gluon propagator in landau gauge did not behave precisely as the `` scaling solution '' that ds had suggested , neither in quenched lattice simulations @xcite nor in the presence of dynamical quarks @xcite .",
    "in fact , lattice simulations favored a gluon propagator which tends to a finite value at low momentum in @xmath0 . this massive behavior ( sometimes called `` decoupling '' solution )",
    "gives a propagator which is suppressed with respect to the bare one but not as strongly as in the `` scaling solution '' of ds equations . in parallel such decoupling solutions",
    "were also obtained from ds and nprg equations @xcite , as well as in a `` refined '' version of the gz construction @xcite .",
    "nowadays , all approaches finally converge toward a massive - like gluon propagator in yang - mills theory .",
    "moreover , in what concerns the ghost sector , there is also a consensus in favor of a massless behavior , with a slight enhancement at low energy but with the tree level power - law .",
    "finally , we note that ds and nprg equations favor a coupling constant bounded in the infrared at not too large values , see for instance @xcite .",
    "all these observations led two of us to test wether a simple perturbative analysis where a massive gluon propagator was introduced at the bare level @xcite could reproduce quantitatively the lattice data for several correlation functions .",
    "this lagrangian is invariant under a modified becchi - rouet - stora - tuytin ( brst ) symmetry that ensures the renormalizability of the model @xcite .",
    "however , because of the gluon mass , the associated transformation is not nilpotent . as a consequence",
    ", the textbook construction of a physical space based on the co - homology of the brst charge does not apply .",
    "it must be stressed that this difficulty is common to all methods that go beyond the standard perturbative fp method . in particular",
    ", the standard definition of the physical space does not apply to the gz model but even stronger , does not apply to the procedure implemented on landau - gauge lattice simulations .",
    "in fact the standard perturbative definition based on the cohomology of the brst operator includes in the physical space the transverse gluons .",
    "but this is not satisfactory for two reasons .",
    "first , on physical grounds , we know that gluons are confined and are not part of the physical spectrum .",
    "second , if trasverse gluons were in the physical space , the spectral density associated with their two - point function should be positive and lattice simulations cleary show positivity violations @xcite .",
    "all these considerations show that a proper definition of a physical space is an open and important problem . in this sense",
    ", the lack of a nilpotent brst charge in the curci - ferrari should not prevent us from studying it in relation with the lattice simulations of correlation functions .",
    "it is an open question to know if one can define a physical space for the curcci - ferrari model where all states would have a positive norm .    in the present article",
    "we exploit this massive extension of the faddeev - popov lagrangian in order to study the quark - gluon vertex in landau gauge .",
    "our aim is twofold .",
    "first , we want to compare our findings with lattice simulation in order to have a further test of the ability of the curci - ferrari model to reproduce lattice simulations .",
    "as we show below , we are able to compute the _ full _ vertex at one loop in any dimension , for all tensorial structures and for any configuration of momenta .",
    "the comparison of this one loop result is in reasonable agreement with all available lattice data ( in many cases the agreement is very good ) . in particular , we discuss in detail the results of a certain scalar function ( @xmath2 in the terminology of @xcite ) where a significant discrepancy has been observed between lattice and ds results @xcite .",
    "we discuss this discrepancy in detail giving a very simple explanation of its origin .",
    "second ( and more importantly ) as explained before , this vertex is very important in various physical applications of ds and bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "we expect that the present result will be useful in future physical applications in these equations .",
    "we want to stress here that , as it stands , the simple one - loop calculation presented in this article does not encode a spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "however , the renormalization - group flow leads to a strong enhancement of the quark mass in the infrared , which mimicks , for all practical purposes , the behavior induced by this symmetry breaking .",
    "this is a key ingredient for reproducing the infrared behavior of the quark - gluon vertex .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_model ] we describe in more details our model and shortly review the systematic comparison of one - loop computations with lattice data .",
    "we give some details on the one - loop calculations in sec .",
    "[ sec_one_loop ] and finally present our results in sec .",
    "[ sec_results ] .",
    "in this article , we pursue our systematic analysis of the correlation functions of qcd in the landau gauge , in a scheme where perturbative calculations can be performed in a controlled way for all energies . as explained in the introduction we consider the ( euclidean ) curci - ferrari lagrangian @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gauge field , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are ghost and antighost fields",
    ", @xmath7 is a lagrange multiplier that enforces the landau gauge condition @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the coupling constant and @xmath10 it is important to recall that mass is introduced at the level of the gauge - fixed action . as a consequence , the bare propagators decrease at large momenta as @xmath11 and",
    "the mass induces a soft breaking of the brst symmetry . as a consequence ,",
    "all the ultraviolet properties of the standard faddeev - popov action are preserved to all orders in perturbation theory , in particular renormalizability and the behavior of correlation functions .",
    "one of the main consequences of the mass term is that the low energy properties of the system are more regular than within the usual faddeev - popov approach . in particular",
    ", it is possible to find renormalization schemes in which the coupling constant remains finite down to the deep infrared @xcite , at odds with the findings of standard perturbation theory which presents a divergence of the coupling constant at some energy of the order of 1  gev .",
    "the absence of such a landau pole opens the way to a consistent treatment of the low energy regime of the theory within perturbation theory .",
    "the general idea was tested in @xcite where the quenched gluon and ghost propagators were computed at one - loop order .",
    "the comparison with lattice data is very satisfactory , with a discrepancy of at most 10% in the whole range of energy .",
    "the analysis of the 3-point correlation functions ( three gluons and ghost - gluon ) was performed under the same line of investigation in @xcite .",
    "the comparison with lattice data is also very good although the lattice data are more noisy in this case .    more recently ,",
    "we have considered the influence of dynamical quarks on the theory , which are governed by the lagrangian : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are euclidean dirac matrices satisfying @xmath14 , the flavor index @xmath15 runs over the @xmath16 quark flavors . ] and the covariant derivative of the quark field reads @xmath17 in @xcite we have included the one - loop contribution of the quarks to the previously computed gluon propagator and have computed the quark propagator to the same order .",
    "again , the gluon propagator compares very well with the lattice results .",
    "functions , which gives an indirect effect on the ghost propagator .",
    "again , the comparison of the ghost propagator with lattice data is very satisfactory . ]",
    "the quark propagator can be decomposed in two independent structures in spinor indices , often called the mass ( proportional to the identity in spinor indices ) and field renormalization ( proportional to a dirac matrix ) .",
    "the one - loop results for the quark mass is in good agreement with the lattice data . in particular",
    ", it reproduces the strong enhancement at energies smaller than roughly 2 gev , which is reminiscent of the chiral symmetry breaking . below .",
    "] however , we do not expect that the present simple one - loop calculation can break spontaneously the chiral symmetry . on the other hand , the field renormalization of the quark",
    "is not reproduced correctly , even at a qualitative level .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the one - loop contribution to this quantity is unusually small @xcite .",
    "indeed , when the gluon mass is set to zero , the field renormalization has no contribution at one loop but it does have contributions at two - loops , that , in consequence , become dominant .",
    "this model has also been used in another line of research in a recent series of articles : the extension of yang - mills theory at finite temperature was considered within the same framework with the goal of studying the deconfinement transition @xcite . it was found that a simple one - loop calculation can reproduce the known phenomenology [ second order transition for the su(2 ) group and first order transition for su(3 ) ] .",
    "a next - to leading calculation in the su(2 ) case leads to a quantitative agreement for the critical temperature .",
    "the determination of the quark - gluon vertex at one loop requires to compute the two diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_diags ] .",
    "the result can be decomposed in twelve independent tensorial structures .",
    "we follow here the convention of @xcite and express the quark - gluon vertex as @xmath18 with @xmath19 we give in table [ tab_struc ] the tensorial structures @xmath20 and @xmath21 , together with some informations concerning the scalar functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    [ cols=\"^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the calculations are performed by following the same procedure as described in @xcite .",
    "the feynman rules are implemented in a mathematica procedure and the integrals over momentum written in terms of the passarino - veltman integrals @xcite : @xmath24[(p+q)^2+m_2 ^ 2]}\\\\    & c_0(p_1,p_2,m_1,m_2,m_3)=\\\\ & \\nonumber\\int \\frac { d^dq}{(2\\pi)^d}\\frac 1{[q^2+m_1 ^ 2][(p_1+q)^2+m_2 ^ 2][(p_1+p_2+q)^2+m_3 ^ 2]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our expressions for the different scalar functions expressed in terms of these integrals are available in the supplemental material @xcite .",
    "in actual calculations , it is convenient to use the feynman trick to perform the integrals . in order to reduce the number of feynman parameters",
    ", we use the identity : @xmath25 as many times as possible to reduce the number of propagators appearing in the diagrams . the price to pay is that there appears differences of masses in the denominator . for general momentum configurations , after performing the integrals over the internal momentum , we are left with a double integral over feynman parameters .",
    "however , for integer space dimension and for some momentum configurations that are considered in next section , all integrals can be realized analytically .",
    "we thus obtain analytic expressions for the one - loop vertex for those configurations .",
    "we have made several checks of our one - loop expressions .",
    "we have compared our results with those of @xcite which were obtained in the limit of vanishing gluon mass .",
    "our check consists in comparing numerically our results for vanishing gluon mass with those of @xcite .",
    "this was done for several momentum configurations and we find a perfect agreement .",
    "therefore , in the regime where the external momenta are large compared with the gluon mass , our results reproduce those of standard perturbation theory ( including anomalous dimensions and all angular dependences ) . as a consequence , we do not study this regime further below .",
    "another check comes from the behavior of the coupling constants in the chiral limit ( limit of vanishing quark mass ) . in this limit",
    ", we easily derive the ward identity associated with the chiral symmetry : @xmath26 where @xmath27 . by using the anticommutation relations of dirac matrices ,",
    "it is easy to check that , in the chiral limit , the structures @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are not compatible with this ward identity .",
    "we therefore conclude that the associated coupling constants must vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "we have explicitly verified that our one - loop expressions are compatible with this result .",
    "we regularize the theory by using the infrared - safe ( is ) scheme @xcite . as usual , we introduce renormalized quantities , which are related to the bare ones by renormalization factors : @xmath34 the different renormalization factors are defined by imposing : @xmath35 the last two conditions are consequences of non - renormalization theorems which relate the divergent parts of the different renormalization factors @xcite . here , these relations are imposed also for the finite parts .",
    "the last renormalization condition corresponds to the taylor scheme and is obtained by defining the coupling constant through the ghost - gluon vertex function with vanishing momentum for the external ghost .",
    "the condition ( [ nonrenmcond ] ) can not be expressed directly in terms of vertex ( or correlation ) functions . in particular , the mass parameter thus defined is not directly related to the value of the gluon propagator at vanishing momentum .",
    "expressions for the renormalization factors can be found in @xcite .    in the following , we use the renormalization - group improvement for the quark - gluon vertex .",
    "it is obtained by integrating the rg equation for the quark - gluon vertex function @xmath36\\gamma_\\mu=0 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq_rg_eq ] ) we relate the quark - gluon vertex at different scales through the equation : @xmath38 here @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are obtained by integrating the beta functions with initial conditions given at some scale @xmath42 and : @xmath43 observe that the running quark mass appears explicitely in the previous expressions .",
    "this leads to a back - reaction of this running mass on the vertex functions . as a consequence",
    ", the mass takes very different values at @xmath44 and @xmath45  gev . even at a perturbative level , this is a large effect and , as discussed in the next section , is at the origin of the enhancement of some scalar components of the vertex .    in",
    "the is scheme , for the initial conditions of interest for comparing with the lattice data , the coupling constant does not present a landau pole . in order to avoid large logarithms",
    ", we evaluate the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq_int_rg ] ) with @xmath46 of the order of the external momenta when they are larger than the mass . in practice",
    ", we used @xmath47 .",
    "it is important to stress that contrarily to what happens in the pure glue sector , there is an significative dependence on the scheme in the present calculation .",
    "in fact , it is important to chose the renormalization point at a scale that remain fixed when all momenta go to zero as done in @xcite .     in the following ,",
    "we compare our results with lattice data which were obtained in the quenched approximation .",
    "consequently , the beta functions for @xmath9 and @xmath48 as well as the anomalous dimensions for @xmath49 and @xmath50 are evaluated at @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , the quark mass does not back - react on these quantities , but it does back - react on the vertex .",
    "the results presented in the previous section were obtained for an arbitrary momentum configuration and for all tensor structures .",
    "there have been lattice studies of the quark gluon vertex for general kinematics @xcite for a particular tensorial structure in the quenched approximation .",
    "our results are in general qualitative agreement with those of @xcite at the level of precision of the data .    for some particular momentum configurations ,",
    "lattice data were obtained with larger statistics and therefore smaller error bars . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on these configurations which give more stringent tests of the quality of our results .",
    "we perform a comparison with lattice data in three momentum configurations .",
    "the first one corresponds to configurations where the gluon has zero momentum with arbitrary momentum of the quark . in this configuration",
    "many tensorial structures were obtained in the quenched approximation @xcite and we compare below our results for all available functions .",
    "the second configuration corresponds to equal momenta for the quark and antiquark ( and , accordingly , gluon momentum equal to minus the double of them ) .",
    "again , many tensorial structures were obtained in the quenched approximation for this configuration @xcite and we study all of them below . on top of these two families of configurations ,",
    "we consider a more general configuration with equal momentum in modulus of quarks and anti - quarks but for various possible angles between them ( or , equivalently , different values of the modulus of the gluon momentum ) .",
    "this configuration includes as particular cases the previous ones but for general angles only a single tensorial structure has been simulated @xcite ( also in the quenched approximation ) . for the comparison with the simulations ,",
    "we focus on two values of modulus of the gluon momenta and also for the completely symmetric configuration where the incoming momentum of the gluon is equal in modulus to the quark and antiquark momenta .",
    "it must be pointed out that the employed data are more that ten years old .",
    "more recent data with improved lattice parameter could allow to perform a more precise test of our curves but they do not exist for the moment .    in the end of this section",
    "we finally discuss the effect of including dynamical quarks for the present vertex .",
    "even if there are no simulations of this vertex in the unquenched case , there are some simulations of 2-point functions @xcite that allows to fix the parameters and , in consequence , we are able to make a prediction of the behaviour of the quark - gluon vertex for the conditions that are present in those simulations .",
    "these could be compared to future unquenched simulations of the quark - gluon vertex .",

    "a similar behavior is observed in the study of propagators @xcite .",
    "we give now two possible ( probably complementary ) explanations for this .",
    "first , one of the reasons of the success of a perturbative analysis in the gluon and ghost sector is that the relevant couplings ( the value of the 3-gluon and ghost - gluon couplings ) are moderate except , for the 3-gluon vertex for very small values of the coupling where the presence of the gluon mass , has already suppressed fluctuations .",
    "however , in the quark sector , even if the coupling does not presents a landau pole , it reaches significantly larger values than in the pure - glue sector .",
    "one measure of this is the value of the coupling @xmath137 or @xmath136 .",
    "one can define a natural running coupling function for this functions as @xmath138 .",
    "it is important to stress that even if for @xmath139 , all the definitions of the running coupling give a universal beta function , this is not the case for momenta @xmath140 . in consequence",
    ", the moderate values of the coupling in a certain scheme does not exclude that it may be large in some other scheme .",
    "in particular , one observes that for small values of @xmath141 the quark - gluon coupling is larger by a factor of 2.4 with respect to the ghost - gluon coupling ( giving a larger expansion parameter by a factor @xmath142 . in a sense , this is to be expected because it is well established ( see , for example , @xcite ) that the quark - gluon coupling that is required for generating dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dscb ) is larger that the one that is extracted from the ghost - gluon vertex .",
    "now , the expansion parameter of the perturbative expansion in the present model in the ghost - gluon sector ( precisely discussed in @xcite ) may reach values of the order of 0.2 . in consequence ,",
    "the expansion parameter in the quark - gluon sector seem to put the perturbative expansion in trouble at very low momenta .",
    "this may indicate that even in the present model where the ghost - gluon sector seem to be treatable perturbatively , some sort of partial resummation is needed in the quark sector ( or , at least , in part of it ) .",
    "these facts also reflects on a certain tension when the parameters have to be chosen in order to fit all the data at the same time . even if the overall agreement is good with a single set of parameters , a precise renormalization scheme had to be chosen because at very low momenta an important sensitivity is observed .",
    "this last point is related to a second possible origin of discrepancies . in the quark - gluon vertex ,",
    "the quantities that are not sensitive to the dcsb are much better es- timated that those that are sensitive to it .",
    "the function @xmath137 , gives better agreement than the @xmath143 or the @xmath135 ( which are sensitive to the dsbc ) .",
    "this manifests also in the fact that those quantities seem to have a larger sensitivity on the renormalization conditions .",
    "now , it is not clear in what measure we have properly taken into account the role of the dsbc . even if rg effect gives an important enhancement of the quark mass in the infrared that quantitatively reasonably reproduces the mass function measured in the lattice , it is unclear at the moment if a proper treatment dsbc will require to use more sophisticated techniques as the introduction of composite fields for the chiral condensate .",
    "this may be at the origin of the lower quality of quantities that are sensitive to the dsbc .",
    "in this article , we have presented the calculation of the quark - gluon vertex at one loop in the massive ( curci - ferrari ) extension of the landau gauge .",
    "the results were decomposed on the twelve independent tensorial structures .",
    "we implement the renormalization - group improvement so as to avoid large logarithms .",
    "we find that these analytic results compare qualitatively well with the quenched lattice data . in one case ( @xmath2 for a vanishing gluon mass )",
    ", the difference between lattice data ( that predicts a divergence at low momentum ) and our ( which are finite at small momenta ) may be attributed to a difference of large numbers when extracting this function from lattice data .    at the quantitative level , we observe that the quantities that are not forbidden by chiral symmetry are reproduced at the level of 10% except for momenta of the order of 100 - 200 mev where larger errors are found , as detailed in the results section .",
    "the others are much more difficult to reproduce and show strong dependence on the renormalization - group scheme .",
    "this is probably to be attributed to the rather crude treatment of chiral symmetry breaking in our calculation .",
    "moreover , in order to fit simultaneously both the mass function coming from the quark propagator and the vertex function , a certain tension in the choose of parameters is observed and in order for this to be fulfilled it is necessary to choose a precise renormalization scheme .",
    "it is interesting to point out that even if , at the end , the agreement of the present one - loop calculation is reasonably good , the precision is not as good as in the ghost - gluon sector .",
    "this may be related to a larger value of the associated coupling and some sort of resummation in this sector could be useful .",

    "<S> we investigate the quark - gluon three - point correlation function within a one - loop computation performed in the curci - ferrari massive extension of the faddeev - popov gauge - fixed action . </S>",

    "<S> are compared with lattice data . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the comparison is in general very satisfactory for the functions which are compatible with chiral symmetry , except for one . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this may be due to large systematic errors when extracting this function from lattice simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities which break chiral symmetry are more sensitive to the details of the renormalization scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we however manage to reproduce some of them with good precision . </S>",
    "<S> the chosen parameters allow to simultaneously fit the quark mass function coming from the quark propagator with a reasonably agreement . </S>"
