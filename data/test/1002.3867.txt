    "recently , the discovery of the acceleration of cosmological expansion at present epoch has been the most principal achievement of observational cosmology .",
    "numerous cosmological observations , such as type ia supernovae ( snia )  @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite and large scale structure  @xcite , strongly suggest that the universe is spatially flat with about @xmath6 ordinary baryonic matter , @xmath7 dark matter and @xmath8 dark energy .",
    "the accelerated expansion of the present universe is attributed to the dominant component of the universe , dark energy , which not only has a large negative pressure , but also does not cluster as ordinary matter does .",
    "in fact , it has not been detected directly and there is no justification for assuming that dark energy resembles known forms of matter or energy .",
    "a large body of recent work has focussed on understanding the nature of dark energy .",
    "however , the physical origin of dark energy as well as its nature remain enigmatic at present .",
    "the simplest model of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath9  @xcite , whose energy density remains constant with time @xmath10 ( natural units @xmath11 is used throughout the paper ) and whose equation of state ( defined as the ratio of pressure to energy density ) remains @xmath12 as the universe evolves .",
    "unfortunately , the model is burdened with the well known cosmological constant problems , namely the fine - tuning problem : why is the energy of the vacuum so much smaller than we estimate it should be ? and the cosmic coincidence problem : why is the dark energy density approximately equal to the matter density today ?",
    "these problems has led many researchers to try a different approach to the dark energy issue .",
    "furthermore , the recent analysis of the snia data indicates that the time dependent dark energy gives better fit than the cosmological constant . instead of assuming",
    "the equation of state @xmath13 is a constant , some authors investigate the dynamical scenario of dark energy which is usually described by the dynamics of a scalar field . the most popular model among them is dubbed quintessence  @xcite , which invoke an evolving scalar field @xmath14 with a self - interaction potential @xmath15 minimally coupled to gravity . besides , other scalar - field dark energy models have been studied , including phantom  @xcite , tachyon  @xcite , quintom  @xcite , ghost condensates  @xcite , etc . also , there are other candidates , for example , chaplygin gas which attempt to unify dark energy and dark matter  @xcite , braneworld model which explain the acceleration through the fact that the general relativity is formulated in five dimensions instead of the usual four  @xcite .    on the other hand , recently , more and more researchers have made a great deal of effort to consider modifying einstein s general relativity ( gr ) in order to interpret an accelerated expansion of the universe avoiding the existence of dark energy . as is well known ,",
    "there are numerous ways to generalize einstein s theory , in which the most famous alternative to gr is scalar - tensor theory  @xcite .",
    "there are still various proposals , for example , dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) gravity  @xcite , @xmath0 gravity  @xcite , and so forth .",
    "the so - called @xmath0 gravity is a straightforward generalization of the einstein - hilbert action by including nonlinear terms in the scalar curvature .",
    "it has been shown that some of these additional terms can give accelerating expansion without dark energy  @xcite .",
    "generally , in deriving the einstein field equations there are actually two different variational principles that one can apply to the einstein - hilbert action , namely , the metric and the palatini approach . the choice of the variational principle is usually referred to as a formalism , so one can use the metric formalism and the palatini formalism . in the metric formalism",
    ", the connection is assumed to be the christoffel symbol defined in terms of the metric and the action is only varied with respect to the metric . while in the latter the metric and the connection are treated as independent variables and",
    "one varies the action with respect to both of them .",
    "in fact , for an action which is linear in @xmath16 , both approaches are equivalent , and the theory reduces to gr .",
    "however when the action includes nonlinear functions of of the ricci scalar @xmath16 , the two methods give different field equations .",
    "it was pointed out by dolgov and kawasaki that the fourth order equations in the metric formalism suffer serious instability problem  @xcite , however , the palatini formalism provides second order field equations , which are free from the instability problem mentioned above  @xcite .",
    "additionally , for the metric approach , the models of the type @xmath17 are incompatible with the solar system experiments  @xcite and have the correct newtonian limit seemed to be a controversial issue  @xcite .",
    "another important point is that these models can not produce a standard matter - dominated era followed by an accelerating expansion  @xcite . while , for the palatini approach the models satisfy the solar system tests but also have the correct newtonian limit  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the above type can produce the sequence of radiation - dominated , matter - dominated and late accelerating phases .",
    "thus , as already mentioned , the palatini approach seems appealing though some issues are still of debate , for example , the instability problems  @xcite . here , we will concentrate on the palatini formalism .",
    "in addition , since more and more cosmological models have been proposed , the problem of discriminating different dark energy models is now emergent . in order to solve this problem ,",
    "a sensitive and robust diagnosis for dark energy models is necessary . as we all know",
    ", the equation of state @xmath13 could probably discriminate some basic dark energy models , i.e. , the cosmological constant @xmath9 with @xmath12 , the quintessence with @xmath18 , the phantom with @xmath19 , and so on .",
    "however , for some geometrical models arising from modifications to the gravitational sector of einstein s theory , the equation of state @xmath13 no longer plays the role of a fundamental physical quantity and the ambit of it is not so clear , thus it would be very useful to propose a new diagnosis to give all classes of cosmological models an unambiguous discrimination . in order to achieve this aim , sahni et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the statefinder pair @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is generated from the scalar factor @xmath22 and its higher derivatives with respect to the cosmic time @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is expressed by @xmath21 and the deceleration parameter @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the statefinder is a `` geometrical '' diagnostic in the sense that it depends upon the scalar factor and hence upon the metric describing space time . according to different cosmological models ,",
    "clear differences for the evolutionary trajectories in the @xmath3 plane can be found , so the statefinder diagnostic may possibly be used to discriminate different cosmological models . in recent works  @xcite , the statefinder diagnostic",
    "have been successfully demonstrated that it can differentiate a series of cosmological models , including the cosmological constant , the quintessence , the phantom , the chaplygin gas , the holographic dark energy models , the interacting dark energy models , etc .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the @xmath0 theory in palatini formalism and consider a number of varieties of @xmath0 theories recently proposed in the literature .",
    "moreover , we apply the statefinder diagnosis to such @xmath0 theories .",
    "we find that the models in the palatini @xmath0 gravity can be distinguished from dark energy models .",
    "in addition , we use the observational @xmath5 data derived from ages of the passively evolving galaxies to make a combinational constraint .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.2 , we briefly review the @xmath0 gravity in palatini formalism and study the cosmological dynamical behavior of palatini @xmath0 theories . in sec.3 , we apply the statefinder diagnosis to various @xmath0 gravity . in sec.4",
    ", we obtain the parameters from the observational constraints .",
    "finally , the conclusions and the discussions are presented .",
    "we firstly review the palatini formalism from the generalized einstein - hilbert action @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the gravitational constant , @xmath29 is the determinant of the metric @xmath30 , @xmath0 is the general function of the generalized ricci scalar @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the matter action which depends only on the metric @xmath30 and the matter fields @xmath33 and not on the independent connection @xmath34 differentiated from the levi - civita connection @xmath35 . in our paper ,",
    "nature unit @xmath36 is used .",
    "it should be noted that gr will come about when @xmath37 .",

    "note that @xmath47 .    according to eq .",

    "( 2 ) and ( 9 ) , the modified friedmann equation can be derived as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the hubble parameter and the dot denotes the differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , taking the trace of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , gives @xmath60 if we consider the universe only containing dust - like matter , then @xmath61 , where , @xmath62 denotes the energy density of matter .",
    "furthermore , combining eq .",

    "( 15 ) and ( 17 ) , choosing units so that @xmath80  @xcite , we can solve for @xmath77 given that the rest ones except one parameter are fixed .    on the other hand , in order to understand the cosmological evolution behavior , it is useful to define the effective equation of state @xmath81 thus , we can show the effective equation of state as a function of redshift @xmath75 for any @xmath0 from eqs .",
    "( 16)-(18 ) .    in our paper , we adopt two types of @xmath0 theories , recently considered in the literature .",
    "we consider the following general form for @xmath0 @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are real constants with the same sign .",
    "such theories have been considered with the hope of explaining the early and the late accelerated expansion of our universe  @xcite .",
    "note that not all combinations of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are agreement with a flat universe with the early matter dominated era followed by an accelerated expansion at late times . at the early times of matter dominated , the universe is better described by gr in order to avoid confliction with early - time physics such as big bang nucleonsynthesis ( ssn ) and cmb .",
