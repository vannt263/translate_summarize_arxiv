    "the elasto - viscoplastic deformation of solids is a complex process that couples widely separate time and length scales . in polycrystalline solids , plastic deformation",
    "is mainly mediated by dislocations , which form complex and strongly interacting networks that give rise to a rich macroscopic phenomenology . in disordered solids",
    "( e.g. noncrystalline / amorphous solids below their glass temperature and granular materials ) , which lack long - range structural order , plastic deformation is mediated by localized shear - driven rearrangements involving a small number of basic elements ( molecules / atoms / grains ) .",
    "these rearrangements produce inhomogeneous mesoscopic deformation fields that affect their surroundings . in both cases ,",
    "the small scale dynamics are highly heterogenous , intermittent and seemingly non - deterministic , yet the emergent macroscopic phenomena are quite robust . developing predictive continuum models that effectively bridge over the widely separate scales remains a major challenge of prime scientific and technological importance .",
    "the most successful methodology for bridging over widely separated scales is equilibrium statistical thermodynamics .",
    "however , the viscoplastic deformation of solids is an intrinsically out - of - equilibrium phenomenon , hence standard equilibrium thermodynamics is not directly applicable in this case .",
    "nevertheless , statistical concepts and the most general form of the laws of thermodynamics might still be applicable .",
    "our goal in this paper is to incorporate recently developed out - of - equilibrium statistical concepts into a continuum thermomechanical framework for the large elasto - viscoplastic deformation of amorphous solids .",
    "models for the elasto - viscoplastic deformation of amorphous solids have been quite extensively discussed in recent literature , see for example @xcite .",
    "the basic idea that has emerged in the statistical physics community in the last 15 years or so , is that the degrees of freedom of an amorphous / glassy material ( i.e. the various contributions to the internal energy and entropy ) can be approximately decomposed into two qualitatively different groups @xcite .",
    "one group includes the vibrational motions of particles around a mechanically stable configuration ( sometimes termed an inherent structure ) .",
    "these motions equilibrate with the thermal reservoir on a microscopic timescale ; i.e. the temperature apparent in the vibrational fluctuations quickly evolves to match that of the reservoir .",
    "the other group includes the mechanically stable configurations themselves and the slow configurational rearrangements that allow transitions between them .",
    "these are mainly driven by external mechanical forces , possibly assisted by thermal fluctuations .",
    "it is the configurational degrees of freedom that fall out of internal equilibrium with the vibrational degrees when a glass is formed ; and it is these degrees of freedom that undergo structural relaxation when a glass ages and evolve when a glass deforms plastically .",
    "numerous recent theoretical , numerical and experimental studies have provided quantitative evidence that the configurational degrees of freedom of either an aging or a deforming amorphous / glassy material attain a temperature of their own , which is markedly different from the temperature corresponding to the vibrational fluctuations of the microconstituents .",
    "the early works demonstrating the existence of a configurational temperature , usually termed an `` effective temperature '' in the statistical physics community , were rather exclusively based on deviations from the equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation ( for a very recent and comprehensive review see @xcite ) .",
    "that is , it was shown ( mainly using simple models and molecular dynamics simulations ) that the long time dynamics of an aging glassy material satisfy a generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation with a temperature that is different from the temperature associated with the vibrational motion of the microconstituents @xcite .",
    "of special importance for our present purposes are the colloidal glass experiments of @xcite , which explicitly demonstrate that the effective temperature of a sample slowly evolves toward the thermal ( i.e. vibrational ) temperature over very long times , and eventually approaches it .",
    "this suggests that the two temperatures interact thermodynamically through an equilibration process akin to fourier s relation to reach a common value .",
    "generalized fluctuation - dissipation relations were also tested for steadily deforming simulated glasses , again demonstrating the existence of a well - defined effective temperature @xcite .",
    "another line of investigation focused on `` athermal systems '' , i.e. systems where no ordinary thermal ( vibrational ) fluctuations take place either due to coupling to a zero temperature bath ( e.g. in computer simulations ) or when the basic elements are too big to experience thermal vibrations .",
    "realistic examples include foams ( made of bubbles ) and granular materials ( made of grains ) where the large size of the basic elements induces dissipation that rapidly quenches vibrations . in @xcite , durian s foam model @xcite",
    "was studied under slow , steady shear deformation conditions .",
    "five different definitions commonly used to define the ordinary thermal ( vibrational ) temperature  pressure and energy fluctuation relations , the green - kubo relation for the shear viscosity , the stokes - einstein relation , and the thermodynamic definition from the rate of change of configurational energy with entropy  were tested and it was discovered that all definitions yielded a similar effective temperature , though the system itself was strictly athermal .",
    "similar ideas were developed and tested for granular materials @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite showed by explicit calculation that the effective temperature is equivalently given by the derivative of the configurational energy with respect to the entropy of configurational states .",
    "this implies that the configurational subsystem behaves as a distinct thermodynamic entity , featuring a configurational temperature defined as the derivative of the configurational energy with respect to the configurational entropy , precisely as we formulate in detail below .",
    "experimental verification of the effective temperature concept is currently limited to systems in which the basic elements are sufficiently large to be directly tracked , such as grains in granular materials and colloidal particles in colloidal glasses @xcite .",
    "we finally note that the literature on the effective ( configurational ) temperature is immense and can not be exhaustively reviewed here .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for additional information and relevant references .",
    "two - temperature thermodynamic frameworks for spatially homogeneous , non - plastically deforming , glassy materials have been investigated by several authors @xcite , and extended models coupling the evolution of internal state variables to the new thermodynamic variables have begun to emerge .",
    "applications to amorphous plasticity  recent shear - transformation - zone ( stz ) models @xcite  , to soft glassy rheology @xcite , to dislocation - mediated crystal plasticity @xcite , to glassy memory effects @xcite and to hard - sphere materials @xcite have been proposed .",
    "very recently , this framework has been used to explain a ductile - to - brittle transition in bulk metallic glasses @xcite .    with this background ,",
    "we present the three major goals of this paper :    * to determine the general features of a rational thermomechanical framework which permits , at the outset , the existence of a second primitive temperature .",
    "we view this as a question of basic , fundamental interest . +",
    "* to show that the essential two - temperature principles developed in the statistical physics community can be fit within a consistent thermomechanical framework . +",
    "* to highlight certain non - trivial phenomena captured by the resulting constitutive framework , when choosing forms for various constitutive functions .",
    "we proceed through several steps . in the first step",
    ", we describe the decomposition of the standard continuum laws of energy balance and entropy imbalance ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) into sub - balances for the two subsystems . at this point",
    ", we demonstrate basic thermomechanical consequences of these hypotheses ( including items 1 , 2 and 3 on the list below ) by presenting a simple example of a two - temperature plasticity model . to develop a micro - statistically motivated model we next revert back to our basic hypotheses and , borrowing certain notions from @xcite , introduce a minimal set of internal state variables , and permit the energy and entropy of the configuration to depend on them .",
    "we assume defect - like functional forms for the entropy and energy of the internal variables , and assume constitutive dependences for the other variables consistent with the subsystems decomposition .",
    "restrictions based on the second - law of thermodynamics then lead to a set of `` fourier - type relations '' for heat transfer between the subsystems and through space , which give rise to a pair of heat equations , one for each temperature .",
    "finally , we develop a specific plastic flow rule based on an stz - micromechanism @xcite .",
    "the resulting model is then shown to capture a number of non - trivial phenomena observed in glassy deformation , including    1 .",
    "structural rejuvenation ( i.e. increase in structural disorder ) under shearing .",
    "2 .   a finite configurational temperature in slow , steady shearing .",
    "slow aging of the structural degrees of freedom near the glass transition .",
    "newtonian flow near the glass transition .",
    "emergence of a flow stress for steady flows at low temperatures .",
    "our goal in this section is to mathematically express the basic hypotheses discussed in the introduction and to systematically explore the implications of them for thermodynamics .",
    "this will set the stage for the thermomechanical analysis to be presented later .      by `` nonequilibrium '' processes we refer to thermodynamic processes that do not immediately maximize the entropy . as a motivational example , consider a closed system containing two identical blocks of a highly heat - conductive material , which make contact on either side of a thermally conducting layer .",
    "the layer conducts heat between the blocks ( labeled a and b ) at a rate @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the blocks temperatures . if @xmath3 , the system equilibrates on a microscopic timescale , i.e. a temperature difference can not exist for a finite time .",
    "if @xmath4 , we have a completely decoupled nonequilibrium system , for which the system is composed of two separate equilibrium subsystems that never approach a mutual equilibrium temperature ( if @xmath5 initially ) . for finite @xmath6",
    ", we obtain a non - trivial , nonequilibrium system : any temperature difference between the blocks gradually approaches an equilibrium temperature and the joint system gradually approaches a maximum entropy state .    as discussed above",
    ", this latter case is analogous to observations made in amorphous materials . instead of two blocks separated in space",
    ", the material is viewed as having two weakly coupled subsystems appearing within the internal energy and entropy functions .",
    "consider an idealized amorphous system containing randomly and densely packed interacting particles .",
    "focus first on the _ kinetic / vibrational _ ( k / v ) degrees of freedom , which describe random thermal vibrations around a mechanically stable microscopic configuration . in the amorphous setting , these degrees of freedom manifest as the part of the internal energy that arises due to the particles rattling about some mean positions within their cages of nearest neighbors .",
    "this subsystem rapidly equilibrates with an external bath . in the vicinity of the glass transition temperature and below it ,",
    "the timescale of these vibrations is much faster than the slow timescale characterizing structural relaxation and typical rates of deformation .",
    "indeed , the subsystems separation is essentially a timescales separation . by averaging over the short vibrational timescale ,",
    "the energy stored within the microscopic structure itself can be measured , which is classified as energy in the _ configurational _ subsystem . moreover , as the structure is deformed into new configurations , we should also account in this subsystem for the energy due to non - affine motion of the particles ( averaged over the vibrational timescale ) , resulting from the intermittent collective particle - level rearrangements .",
    "under most circumstances , the kinetic energy of this movement comprises a very small contribution to the configurational energy .",
    "the _ internally nonequilibrium _ nature of the material is characterized by the fact that for a given total internal energy , the distribution of energy into configurational and k / v subsystems does not generally maximize the total entropy .",
    "rather , a finite energy exchange rate @xmath7 can exist between the two subsystems , passing energy from the higher to the lower temperature subsystem , which plays the role of @xmath8 in the previous illustrative example . indeed , the internal heat flow @xmath7 accounts for entropy production in the material , together with more conventional sources of entropy production , such as spatial heat fluxes .",
    "the finiteness of @xmath7 in the amorphous setting can be distinguished from the example cases of weakly sheared newtonian fluids or elastically deformed crystals . in a",
    "weakly sheared fluid , thermal vibrations and stress - relaxing hopping motions occur on timescales that are not many orders of magnitude separated , and all of the degrees of freedom can be characterized by a single temperature . hence , equipartition is satisfied , i.e. the total configurational energy remains in equilibrium with the kinetic degrees of freedom , analogous to @xmath9 . in an elastically deformed crystal , both thermal vibrations and the external driving forces",
    "are , by the definition of the elastic regime , too weak to induce structural changes ( e.g. dislocations motion ) , and hence the configurational degrees of freedom are essentially decoupled from the vibrational ones , analogous to @xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless , the microscopic kinetic and potential energies due to the crystal vibrations do maintain equilibrium following the equipartition theorem , which is completely analogous to our caricature of the k / v subsystem as single `` block '' in the thermodynamic analysis .",
    "in the case of shearing an amorphous solid , as was discussed in detail above ( see , for example , @xcite ) , there exists ample evidence that the configurational degrees of freedom also form a single equilibrated `` block '' , which is distinguished from the k / v `` block '' , and hence two distinct temperatures may be sufficient to approximately describe the internal thermodynamics of the system . this physical picture",
    "is schematically sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "let us denote by @xmath11 the temperature of the configurational subsystem and by @xmath12 the temperature of the kinetic / vibrational subsystem , which will both be formalized in detail in the following sections .",
    "the configurational temperature @xmath11 is a generalization of the relatively old notion of a fictive temperature @xcite .",
    "it is typically _ higher _ than the thermal temperature @xmath12 , because the structure typically retains memory of configurations characteristic of the higher temperature prior to a rapid quench and is also constantly being rejuvenated by the external driving forces .",
    "following our two - block analogy , one would expect a fourier - type relation of the form @xmath13 .",
    "we note in passing that thermo - elastic effects ( e.g. thermal expansion , temperature - sensitive elastic moduli ) provide another form of interaction between the two subsystems , which is not mediated by the heat flux @xmath7 .",
    "_ we neglect these phenomena in the present work _ to focus more heavily on the deviatoric ( non - volumetric ) plastic response",
    ".    an important subtlety of the ensuing analysis pertains to the functional dependence of the conductivity @xmath14 . in the absence of plastic deformation",
    ", only ordinary thermal fluctuations can pull the system out of a local configuration and induce flow from the configurational subsystem to the kinetic / vibrational one .",
    "as the glass transition is approached , thermal fluctuations become increasingly ineffective in spontaneously inducing structural relaxation , and consequently @xmath14 becomes extremely small in the absence of imposed shearing ( it strictly vanishes if there exists an ideal glass transition ) . in the presence of plastic deformation",
    ", rearrangements are activated and energy can again flow between the two subsystems , i.e. @xmath15 , at a rate that is affected by the rate of plastic deformation itself . moreover , the rearrangements themselves can mediate diffusion of @xmath11 , when the latter is spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "this occurs microscopically through the long range eshelby - like fields that are generated by the localized shear rearrangements ( that can be viewed as eshelby - like inhomogeneities @xcite ) .",
    "the direct dependence of the inter - subsystem conductivity and intra - configurational subsystem diffusivity on the rate of plastic deformation is a unique feature of these systems and hence of the corresponding material models .",
    "we now turn to formulate these ideas mathematically .",
    "consider a deformation process for which @xmath16 is the reference coordinate , @xmath17 is the deformed coordinate and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the motion function . the spatial velocity field is then defined by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the lagrangian time derivative .",
    "the local first law of thermodynamics reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass density , @xmath24 is the internal energy per unit mass , @xmath25 is the cauchy stress tensor , @xmath26 is the spatial velocity gradient ( i.e @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 is the spatial heat flux and @xmath29 is the spatial divergence operator .",
    "in the above we have assumed no internal heat sources or sinks , which would otherwise add a scalar heating term to the right hand side .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the internal entropy per unit mass and @xmath32 the entropy flux .    in the spirit of the previous discussion",
    ", we now apply the assumption that the thermodynamical quantities can be approximately decomposed into their kinetic / vibrational and configurational contributions , denoted hereafter by the subscripts @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "first , we separate the internal energy and entropy into configurational and kinetic / vibrational contributions @xmath35 next , the heat flux is assumed to approximately decompose as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the fluxes of configurational energy ( @xmath39 ) and k / v energy ( @xmath40 , respectively . to gain physical insight into this decomposition , note that the heat flux @xmath28 into ( out of ) a part of a body represents the flux of energy due to the flow of randomized movement of the microscopic constituents  movements that collectively have zero mean velocity relative to the continuum - scale motion . in our context",
    ", we can envision two different manifestations of the passage of randomized movement .",
    "the kinetic heat flux @xmath38 may be seen as the `` standard '' flux describing the passage of random vibrational motion into ( out of ) a part .",
    "the configurational contribution @xmath37 can be understood as the energy flux due to rearrangements of the structure , which pass energy across space by disturbing the neighboring structural assembly in a random fashion , and which does not count any k / v vibrational mechanisms in so doing .",
    "the entropy flux is similarly decomposed into two additive contributions @xmath41 in the classical clausius - duhem inequality , the temperature @xmath42 is positted as a scalar , non - negative field , which relates the heat and entropy fluxes by @xmath43 .",
    "we introduce the notion of a second primitive temperature  the most noteworthy departure from common thermomechanics in this paper  by assuming analogously that each subsystem contribution to the entropy flux is proportional to its corresponding heat flux via an as - yet - undefined temperature field , giving @xmath44 and @xmath45 . as a result @xmath46",
    "the case of @xmath47 corresponds to internal nonequilibrium , whereas @xmath48 in internal equilibrium and we recover the standard entropy flux @xmath43 .",
    "we also assume each temperature is necessarily non - negative .",
    "we should also mention that our choice of @xmath44 and @xmath45 is somewhat analogous to multi - temperature thermomechanical models for immiscible mixtures @xcite ; instead of @xmath34 and @xmath33 subsystems , each phase of the mixture is permitted its own temperature and the relation between heat and entropy fluxes within each phase , and their additive appearance in the second law , appears in direct analogy to ours .    adopting the conventional krner - lee decomposition of the total deformation gradient tensor @xmath49 @xcite , @xmath50 we can write the stress - power as @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite . we note that @xmath58 maps the reference ( undeformed ) space into the so - called intermediate space and that @xmath59 maps the intermediate space into the deformed space .",
    "also note that @xmath60 and hence @xmath61 .    in what follows",
    "we assume that plastic shear deformation involves no volumetric changes , i.e. we set @xmath62 . in doing so",
    "we neither imply that there exists no coupling between plastic shear deformation and dilation / contraction nor that this coupling is of no importance .",
    "such coupling is well documented for amorphous solids and might have consequences for their mechanics @xcite .",
    "we have developed a theory that includes pressure - sensitivity and shear dilation ; however , the added complexities that arise suit reporting in a subsequent publication .",
    "to proceed , we need separate energy balance equations for the two subsystems , which sum together to give the first law of thermodynamics in eq .",
    "( [ 1st ] ) .",
    "we propose that these take the following form @xmath63    let us discuss in detail the physical meaning of the different terms on the right - hand - sides of these equations .",
    "the spatial contributions to the heat flow _ within _ each subsystem are @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the kinetic and configurational subsystems respectively .",
    "@xmath7 is the scalar internal heat flow that transfers energy _ between _ the configurational subsystem and the kinetic one .",
    "the rest of the terms represent the way the total stress - power @xmath66 is distributed among the subsystems .",
    "first , we note that elasticity resides in the configurational subsystem and hence reversible elastic energy appears in the @xmath34 subsystem energy balance ; recall that we neglect thermo - elastic and volumetric effects , which could conceivably admit an elastic term in the @xmath33 subsystem .",
    "the remaining terms give the plastic stress - power @xmath67 .",
    "to remain general , we permit the plastic stress - power to affect both subsystems , by splitting @xmath68 into the sum of two contributions @xmath69 .",
    "the _ stored plastic power _ describes the rate of stored energy of cold work , and thus contributes in the @xmath34 energy balance .",
    "plastic dissipation _ is the rate of energy dissipated as ordinary heat , which is in the form of vibrations and thereby affects the @xmath33 subsystem balance .",
    "applying the chain rule to eq .",
    "( [ 2nd ] ) and substituting eqs .",

    "as was stated in the abstract , internal variables that carry information about the structural state of the deforming solid , and determine its subsequent response , play a central role in a theory of elasto - plasticity .",
    "yet , we present here first a simple two - temperature model for rate - dependent elasto - plasticity , which does not include internal variables .",

    ". these constitutive dependences are not unique .",
    "rather , they are informed by past experience with constitutive theories of thermal plasticity , and are properly extended for consistency with the two - subsystem decomposition .",
    "in addition , the @xmath93 and @xmath94 dependences are also motivated by the statistical - thermodynamics - based model to be described in the upcoming sections .",
    "the above dependences are frame - indifferent ( see appendix [ frame_indifference ] ) , and unlike standard heat transfer theories , we allow all heat flow variables associated with the configurational subsystem to explicitly depend on the plastic rate of deformation . the latter is a key point , as plastic deformation directly influences the time - scale for configurational energy transfer .",
    "finally , in the spirit of the subsystems separation , the above constitutive dependences aim at coupling configurational / kinetic dependent variables with configurational / kinetic independent variables .    substituting the free - energies into the inequality in ( [ int_space_2 ] ) and the expanding time - derivatives , we obtain @xmath95",

    "we then plan to consider spatially inhomogeneous deformation situations in 2d and to specifically focus on shear band widening dynamics , which involve a lengthscale associated with the diffusion of the configurational temperature .",

    "our goal in this section is to augment our thermomechanical model with ideas from recent shear - transformation - zone ( stz ) theories @xcite . by doing this ,",
    "we provide additional information to fill - in remaining details of the constitutive relations , culminating in a shear flow constitutive law . to motivate the connection",
    ", we first discuss the stz micromechanism and its ability to replicate the @xmath278 and @xmath205 functional forms deduced in the previous sections .",
    "we start by postulating the existence of a population of oriented stz s  sparsely distributed localized zones that are more susceptible to shear - driven transformations in a given direction than their surrounding material ( see fig . [ fig2]b ) .",
    "we view stz s not as permanent flow defects , but rather as configurational fluctuations that can appear and disappear due to thermal and mechanically - generated noise ( i.e. the mesoscale stress fields that are generated by structural rearrangements ) .",
    "therefore , the density of stz s essentially describes the probability to find such a configurational fluctuation .",
    "the existence of stz s has been demonstrated in numerous computer simulations and experimental systems , see for example @xcite .",
    "below we will adopt the main physical ingredients of the stz theory , which has been built on the flow - defect theories of turnbull , cohen , argon , spaepen and others @xcite , and incorporate them into the presently developed framework .    in two dimensions , each stz  during its lifetime  is described by its orientation @xmath279 with respect to a fixed reference direction . by definition , an stz oriented along @xmath279 is predisposed to undergo a shear ( volume - conserving ) transformation in the direction of the purely deviatoric , symmetric , unit - magnitude tensor @xmath280 whose major principal vector @xmath281 is oriented along the @xmath279 direction .",
    "the components of the tensor take the form @xmath282 .",
    "the population density of stz s at position @xmath17 at time @xmath283 oriented along @xmath279 is defined as @xmath284 , but we will generally write this without the @xmath17 and @xmath283 for notational simplicity . note that azimuthal periodicity implies @xmath285 .",
    "we define @xmath130 to be the ( intermediate ) volume density of stz s , expressed as an integral over all orientations @xmath286 similarly , we define @xmath131 to be a normalized tensorial moment of the stz distribution in the sense that @xmath287 where the minus sign is used for consistency with previous analyses @xcite .",
    "note also that by construction @xmath288 and that @xmath131 bears some resemblance to orientational order parameters in magnetic and liquid crystalline systems .",
    "the stz s are assumed to be two - state systems that can be driven to `` flip '' from their original orientation @xmath279 to a perpendicular orientation @xmath289 during their lifetime .",
    "while this is definitely an oversimplification as the stz s are multi - atom objects that can feature nontrivial internal structures , this assumption was shown to be sufficient to capture a range of glassy deformation phenomena @xcite .",
    "one might characterize an stz oriented along @xmath279 as an elliptical region whose semi - major axis aligns with @xmath281 .",
    "a `` flip '' is a pure shear transition , that deforms the stz inward along the @xmath281 direction and outward along @xmath290 , leaving the stz , post - transition , oriented in the @xmath290 direction",
    ". the rate at which stz s oriented along @xmath279 undergo a shear transformation into a state oriented along @xmath291 depends on the resolved stress , @xmath292 , and thermal fluctuations , as specified by a rate - factor @xmath293 . for simplicity",
    "we omit the arguments @xmath12 and @xmath11 in writing the rate - factor hereafter .",
    "note that we assume that stz transitions are driven by the dissipative stress @xmath157 .",
    "the evolution law for @xmath294 must account for the change in the stz s orientation when it undergoes shear transformations , as well as for the creation and annihilation of stz s due thermal and mechanically - generated structural fluctuations .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the evolution of @xmath294 satisfies the following master equation @xmath295 term by term , this equation represents the rate - of - change of @xmath294 in terms of the rate of stz s transitions _ into _ a state @xmath279 , minus those transitions _ out of _ a state @xmath279 , plus a production / annihiation term that tends to equilibrate the stz s population with @xmath11 in an isotropic manner .",
    "@xmath203 is a thermodynamic coupling coefficient that plays the role of a noise source that drives the creation and annihilation of stz s .",
    "we must emphasize that this form is consistent with the previous thermomechanical analysis ; it agrees exactly with our second - law constraint , eq .",
    "( [ kcd ] ) , i.e. @xmath296 the integral simplifies as above because the transition terms do not affect the total number of stz s    macroscopic plastic deformation arises in this model from the accumulated effect of all stz s transitions occurring at a given time .",
    "hence , we express the plastic shear ( deviatoric ) flow rate @xmath180 as @xmath297 where @xmath207 is ( half ) the shear strain magnitude of an stz transition .    taking the time derivative of @xmath131 defined in eq .",
    "( [ mdef ] ) and using eqs .",
    "( [ lambdadef])-([int_flow ] ) , we obtain the following closed - form equation for @xmath205 @xmath298 it takes the form assumed in eq .",
    "( [ assumed_dotm ] ) , allowing us to identify @xmath299    equation ( [ int_flow ] ) becomes an explicit flow rule when the function @xmath300 is specified . in the most general case",
    "this would lead to an integral representation of the shear flow rate , that is not necessarily reducible to a simple closed form relation in terms of @xmath130 and @xmath131 alone . in order to explore the properties of the emerging constitutive law , we proceed by choosing a prototypical form for the @xmath294 distribution compatible with some given @xmath130 and @xmath131 values :",
    "@xmath301    it is important at this point to reflect on the status of our analysis so far .",
    "we have at hand a flow rule ( eq . ( [ int_flow ] ) , together with eqs .",
    "( [ levolve ] ) , ( [ mevolve ] ) and ( [ n_approx ] ) ) , which is not fully determined until the rate factor @xmath300 is specified .",
    "in addition , we still have to satisfy the second law inequality in ( [ plast_dissip ] ) , where @xmath302 is not yet specified ( note that @xmath303 is known , once @xmath302 is specified , through the relation @xmath304 ) . there are ( at least ) two possible routes to proceed ; either we model @xmath302 based on physical , but not purely thermodynamical , considerations and use the second law inequality in ( [ plast_dissip ] ) to constrain the rate factor @xmath300 or we model the rate factor @xmath300 based on physical considerations and use the second law inequality in ( [ plast_dissip ] ) to constrain @xmath302 .",
    "the two routes are expected to have different consequences and it is not a priori clear which one is more physically faithful .",
    "below we follow the second route by adopting a simple rate - factor @xmath300 and exploring the consequences through several approximations .",
    "we consider a simple thermally activated process for stz transitions , similar to the form for atomic jumps in @xcite , for which @xmath305 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath208 is a molecular attempt rate and @xmath206 is an stz transition barrier .",
    "using this simple rate factor in the flow rule in eq .",
    "( [ int_flow ] ) , one can perform the integration analytically to obtain the following closed - form expression @xmath306,\\ ] ] where @xmath307 and @xmath308 are the first- and second- order modified bessel functions of the first kind and @xmath309 and @xmath310 .",
    "expanding eq .",
    "( [ simple_flow ] ) to first - order in @xmath311 , we obtain @xmath312    this simplified flow rule has been used in the body of the manuscript for illustrative purposes without insisting on satisfying the condition @xmath313 .",
    "next , we need to make sure that the flow rule in eq .",
    "( [ d_1st ] ) does not violate the second law constraint in ( [ plast_dissip ] ) , which as explained previously , amounts to constraining @xmath302 .",
    "we then assume the following constitutive structure @xmath314 , i.e. that @xmath156 is linear in the orientation tensor @xmath131 , which is then substituted together with @xmath180 of eq .",
    "( [ d_1st ] ) in the inequality in ( [ plast_dissip ] ) .",
    "the resulting inequality is satisfied if we set @xmath315    the expression for @xmath156 in eq .",
    "( [ tp_store_result ] ) is interesting and deserves some discussion .",
    "the prefactor relating @xmath156 and @xmath131 is proportional to @xmath316 , which implies that @xmath156 in this analysis is of _ entropic _ nature .",
    "more specifically , it suggests that configurational fluctuations  whose magnitude is determined by @xmath317  generate an entropic stress proportional to the orientation tensor @xmath131 . recalling the meaning of @xmath318 ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ m_entropy ] ) ) , a lower bound value for @xmath318 is @xmath319 , obtainable by analyzing the minimal case where flow defects have two possible internal orientations .",
    "hence , @xmath320 , which gives positivity of the prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ tp_store_result ] ) .",
    "here we show the constitutive dependences discussed in section [ constit_sys ] are objective or frame - indifferent .",
    "we suppose a rigid - body change in frame of the observer , @xmath321 where @xmath322 is an arbitrary time - varying rotation about some origin @xmath323 and @xmath324 is an arbitrary translation vector .",
    "hence , @xmath325 is the motion as observed by the new observer ; we will continue to use @xmath326 to describe quantities as seen in the new frame .",
    "frame - indifference is upheld if satisfaction of the constitutive functions in the original frame implies satisfaction in the new frame . to show this , we first need to transform the field variables into their corresponding forms in the @xmath326 frame and then check that the same constitutive functions correctly relate the transformed variables .",
    "we start with the fundamental transformations : @xmath327 under the krner - lee kinematic decomposition , the @xmath49 transformation above is satisfied by letting @xmath328 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . consequently",
    ", @xmath329 and @xmath330 combining the latter expression with the transformation for @xmath25 , the elastic and plastic stresses obey @xmath331 the rate of stored plastic power @xmath332 must , as a material scalar , be frame - invariant ( i.e. @xmath333 ) . since @xmath179 has just been shown to be frame - invariant as well , we deduce @xmath334 , and thus @xmath335 .",
    "all scalar constitutive quantities ( e.g. @xmath100 , @xmath338 , @xmath39 , @xmath339 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath130 , @xmath7 ) are inherently frame - invariant . combining this fact with the transformation rules above , we have now shown that the dependent and independent variables related under the constitutive functions @xmath340 , @xmath341 , @xmath342 , @xmath343 , @xmath344 , @xmath345 , @xmath346 proposed in sections [ sec : conventional ] and [ constit_sys ] , are all frame - invariant . likewise , the functional dependences as proposed necessarily satisfy frame - indifference .",
    "lastly , we check that the heat - flux constitutive functions are also objective .",
    "let us temporarily bring back the sub- and superscript @xmath347 to denote intermediate space variables ( recall they were introduced and then dropped in section [ math ] ) .",
    "the heat flux vector in the current configuration @xmath38 transforms under the rotating new frame as @xmath348 .",
    "pulled back to the intermediate space , we have @xmath349 similarly the temperature gradient @xmath350 transforms as @xmath351 .",
    "likewise @xmath352 we thus have that @xmath353 and @xmath354 are both frame - invariant . the same argument",
    "gives that @xmath355 and @xmath356 are also frame - invariant .",
    "consequently , all dependent and independent variables of the functions @xmath357 and @xmath358 in section [ constit_sys ] are frame - invariant , implying that the functional dependences are themselves indifferent to frame .",
