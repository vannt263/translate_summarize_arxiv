    "the vlt nir discovery of an infalling object onto sgr  a * , named g2 , offers an especially exciting possibility for probing the nature of that accretion flow via potential interactions as the object goes through periastron @xcite .",

    "the origin , structure , and fate of the object remain uncertain . while the vlt observations of the br-@xmath6 transition indicate that g2 is being disrupted , through tidal processes and possibly through gas dynamical processes , keck nir observations have shown a persistently compact @xmath7 continuum source @xcite .",
    "these observational results have led to a range of models , from diffuse clouds to dense , dusty stellar winds surrounding stars @xcite . both the nature of the accretion process and the timescale on which it takes place depend sensitively on the density profile of the accretion region and the initial density structure of the object , among other factors @xcite .",
    "proposed models anticipate a steep increase in the accretion rate , potentially by several orders of magnitude , and heightened variability on timescales of months to decades @xcite .",

    "the processing of g2 s material through the accretion flow around sgr  a *  presents a unique opportunity to study the radial density and temperature structure of the flow , filling in crucial gaps in our understanding of ultra - low - eddington - luminosity accretion .    the long - term monitoring at radio and millimeter wavelengths for sgr  a *  demonstrates short - term variability and long - term stability , consistent with damped random walk evolution @xcite . since the detection of sgr a * at shorter wavelengths , x - ray and nir light curves",
    "have also not shown any secular evolution @xcite .",
    "intensive campaigns to monitor sgr  a *  over a wide range of wavelengths have been launched since the discovery of g2 was announced , none of which have detected significant changes in the flux density or activity of sgr  a*@xcite , although those searches did lead to the discovery of the galactic center pulsar psr j1745 - 2900  @xcite .    among the predictions for g2",

    "the ratio of q to l band beam sizes does not exactly follow the expected frequency scaling ratio , which is indicative of the poorly shaped beams from these snapshot observations and frequency - dependent weighting in the imaging stage .",
    "we averaged the data in time into 30s intervals and in frequency for each spectral window .",
    "we then exported the data for further analysis with our code .",
    "we performed two kinds of analyses .",
    "for the first , we extracted flux densities for sgr  a *  by averaging visibility amplitudes on baselines longer than 50 @xmath9 .",

    "* ) . for each epoch , we gridded the visibilities for each spectral window and then found individual grid cells for which there was an overlap between the individual epoch and the remaining ensemble .",
    "we differenced each epoch s visibility grid against the grid derived from the ensemble of visibilities ( minus the particular epoch ) .",
    "the differential flux density was determined as a weighted sum of the residual visibilities .",
    "we applied a weighting scheme that scales as the inverse of the @xmath10 distance .",

    "the large number of data sets gives good overlap between extended and compact structures .",

    "the pipeline software applied system temperatures obtained for j1733 - 130 ( nrao 530 ) to sgr  a * , which introduces an error because of the different atmospheric optical depth toward these two sources . to correct for this effect , we fitted system temperatures for all sources in each epoch to determine the atmospheric optical depth and then applied the correct system temperature to sgr  a*. typical changes to the amplitude gain were a few percent , with a maximum value of 7% .",

    "[ fig : almasmaj1733 ] ]      observations of the flux density of sgr  a *  were obtained using the sma , an interferometric array of eight 6-m diameter radio dishes located near the summit of mauna kea , hawaii @xcite . in most cases",
    "the sma was operating in a single receiver mode , providing 4 ghz continuum bandwidth in a single polarization , in two sidebands , with the array tuned to one of the three main sma bands ( 1.3 mm , 1.1 mm and 870 micron ) .",
    "data were obtained during short ( @xmath1320 min ) , self - contained observation sets , in which observations of sgr  a *  alternated with those of the relatively nearby blazar j1733 - 130 , and were bookended with observations of a flux standard ( typically neptune ) .",
    "these observations were `` piggy backed '' on full - track scheduled observations - of - the - day for the sma .",
    "this explains the apparent randomness in sky frequencies .",
    "in addition , the flux densities were estimated from a measurements with a single linear polarization .",
    "the fractional linear polarization in sgr a * is typically in the range of 5 - 10 percent and changes rapidly .",
    "the single polarization estimate of the flux density for a polarization of 10 percent has an rms error of 7 percent .",
    "this error is comparable to the level of the statistical errors . to this data set",
    "were added more extensive observations over several hours in dual polarization mode on 5 july and 15 aug 2013 , which allowed short - term monitoring .",
    "data from each observing period were calibrated with the millimeter interferometer reduction ( mir ) suite of reduction routines developed by the sma , involving removal of visibility phase scatter due to atmospheric instability and scaling visibility amplitude via comparison with the flux standard .",
    "neptune was the primary flux standard used ( 85% of observations ) , with uranus ( 13% ) and titan ( 2% ) as the other standards . for uranus and neptune",
    ", we used the broadband spectral model from @xcite .",
    "however , due to the presence of broad co absorption in the spectrum of neptune which is not included in the griffin and orton spectral fit , we opted to use data that were at least 8 ghz separated from either the co(1 - 2 ) or co(3 - 2 ) rotational transitions . for titan",
    ", we used the spectral model developed by author gurwell , which is now included in the casa data reduction package as well ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in all cases the expected error on the flux density scale based upon using these models is  5% . on the other hand , since we are most interested in tracking changes in flux with time , the intrinsic bias in the flux density model is less important .",
    "the presence of gas along the line of sight toward sgr  a *  leads to deep absorption of the sgr  a *  continuum at the co transitions , as well as their isotopologues .",
    "for this reason , we masked spectral regions around these transitions in the sgr  a *  data .",
    "likewise , the structure of the visibility data from sgr  a *  indicated we were sensitive to broad scale continuum emission from dust in the vicinity of sgr  a*. in order to limit our data to emission from sgr  a *  itself , we used only visibility data from baselines that exceeded 35 k@xmath14 , or roughly scales of 6or finer , which was sufficient to isolate sgr  a *  from the broader diffuse emission .",
    "flux densities from the sma for sgr  a *  and j1733 - 130 are tabulated in table  [ tab : smaresults ] .",

    "the ratio of the rms variability to the total flux density , known as the modulation index , is 8% at 40 ghz and below , while it is @xmath15 at millimeter wavelengths .",

    "a mean spectral index of 0.5 between 40 and 218 ghz is required to connect the vla and alma spectra , comparable to what has been seen previously @xcite .",
    "we also fit the alma data with a power - law spectrum ( figure  [ fig : alphaalma ] ) .",

    "assuming stationary statistics for sgr  a *  between the early observations and these new observations , we conclude that there is no evidence for spectral curvature or greater steepening in the spectrum between 230 and 690 ghz .     ]",
    "the millimeter and submillimeter spectrum of sgr  a *  indicates that the optical depth is @xmath12 at frequencies as high as 690 ghz .",
    "the result suggests that the source must be composed of stratified regions near the optically thick - to - thin transition in order to produce a near - flat synchrotron spectrum over this broad frequency range .",
    "a single optically thin synchrotron component can not reproduce the spectrum .",
    "this spectrum can be explained in the context of the classical @xcite jet model , but also by inflowing accretion flow models with radially evolving density and magnetic fields together with some non - thermal particles @xcite .    despite this degeneracy in the emission geometry ,",
    "it is clear that above 350 ghz , sgr a * has to become optically thin .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the transition to higher linear polarization at higher frequencies @xcite , and the increased variability and power - law spectrum seen in the infrared band .",
    "our simultaneous radio through submillimeter data can provide some interesting constraints on the underlying particle distribution , when put into context with the infrared measurements . in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanspec ] we include the average ir flux based on vlt and keck measurements @xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with a mean flux density of @xmath24 mjy in the @xmath25 band and a stable spectral index @xmath26 between @xmath25 and @xmath27 band .",
    "previous estimates of the nir spectral index appear to show steeper spectral indices but may have suffered from non - simultaneous observations of the variable flux density . to illustrate the new limits on the radiating particle distributions , we plot for reference a series of synchrotron spectra from mildly relativistic thermal electrons in equipartition with the magnetic field , ranging from @xmath28 k , assuming an emission region of size @xmath29 .",
    "the observed brightness temperature of sgr a * at 230 ghz is @xmath30 k @xcite .",
    "these are fiducial values spanning the range from the literature ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , to illustrate how stratified , self - absorbed regions can add to a near - flat spectrum , but also to place some limits on the fraction and distribution of non - thermal particles present .",
    "the peak of a given temperature component can shift by a factor of a few in frequency for different emission size regions or energy partition between radiating particles and the magnetic energy density .",
    "however , it is clear that a peak temperature ( in the plasma closest to the black hole ) below a few @xmath31 k can not account for the extension of the self - absorbed spectrum through the alma range shown , and that a peak temperature much higher than a few @xmath32 k would violate the ir limits .",
    "it is also clear from these spectra that a purely thermal distribution can not account for the ir flux .",
    "the intersection of the ir power - law with the intermediate ranges indicates that a non - thermal `` tail '' of particles is present , with normalization on the order of @xmath33% of the thermal peak .",
    "this fraction is consistent with the results of fits to sgr a * in quiescence , using a self - consistent calculation of the particle distribution given a mechanism for injecting a power - law of nonthermal particles @xcite .",
    "recent work exploring second - order acceleration processes in turbulent , magnetized plasmas by @xcite shows the self - consistent production of a such a nonthermal tail ; however , its slope and relation to the thermal peak may be difficult to match to these newest constraints .",
    "therefore the combination of simultaneous alma ( eventually using even higher frequency bands ) and ir data offers the best constraints yet on the shape of the radiating particle distributions and nonthermal fraction .",
    "the results presented here can already be used to guide implementation of the inclusion of particle acceleration in semi - analytical models and in the so - called `` painting '' of grmhd simulations to produce images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "simultaneous observations between alma , ir , and x - ray , particularly during flaring , would provide strong constraints on the upper extreme of the nonthermal population and accelerating mechanisms .      bow shock emission from the interaction of g2 with the accretion flow was anticipated to appear and peak months before the center of mass reached periastron @xcite .",
    "the bow shock would excite nonthermal electrons that then produce synchrotron radiation in the magnetic field of the accretion flow .",
    "the synchrotron radiation is expected to peak at frequencies near 1 ghz and decline with an optically thin power - law index @xmath34 .",
    "the predicted peak flux density of the radio light curve scales with a number of factors , including the relative velocity of the cloud , the accretion flow density profile , the efficiency of nonthermal electron energy production , and the timescale for electrons to cool .",

    "this result is intuitively obvious from the light curve , i.e. the variations over a period of a few day are uncorrelated and have the same range as the variations over the entire data span .",
    "the spectral variations from historical data at millimeter / submillimeter wavelengths are known to approximate white noise at frequencies less than 3 cycles / day , with a steepening power law above that frequency @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that an enhancement of emission caused by g2 might have produced long term variations indicative of red noise .",
    "however , there is no evidence for this effect .",
    "the spectrum of sgr  a *  from radio to submillimeter wavelengths has remained remarkably stable over the past 30 years .",
    "our new vla , alma , and sma results demonstrate that this stability has continued throughout the apparent periastron passage of g2 . in the case of low - frequency emission ,",
    "the absence of significant change permits us to constrain the size of the ensuing bow shock to be a factor of 30 smaller than the apparent g2 size observed with nir wavelengths at larger distances from the black hole .",
    "these observations do not resolve the nature of g2 .",
    "the smaller bow shock size is consistent with both cloud and stellar - wind models .",
    "@xcite propose a model that may reconcile the apparently discrepant nir continuum and spectroscopic observations and may also be consistent with our results .",
    "@xmath7 continuum observations reveal a compact source while br-@xmath6 observations reveal an extended source that appears to be tidally disrupted .",
    "@xcite argue that the continuum emission is the photosphere of a binary stellar merger , while the ionized emission represents a smaller tidally disrupted tail .",
    "the @xmath7 source has a cross - sectional area of @xmath61 @xmath62 , much less than our upper limit of @xmath0 @xmath62 .",
    "however , the size of the extended br-@xmath6 emission , which is consistent between vlt and keck observations , primarily determines the creation of a bow shock .",
    "some form of confinement for the diffuse gas appears to be important for attenuating the shock amplitude .",
    "the lack of any enhanced short wavelength radio and millimeter emission from the black hole is also consistent with a compact size for g2 .",
    "simulations have shown that more extended objects are more readily disrupted and would therefore be more likely to have some gas initiate enhanced accretion onto the black hole .    at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "the mean flux density has not increased by more than @xmath15 relative to historical averages .",
    "this is within the range of variations seen in the past and in other llagn .",
    "thus , we can not attribute any increase in the flux density to a g2-induced enhancement of the accretion rate .",
    "the amplitude and timescale for a change in the accretion rate , should g2 be fully disrupted , are uncertain . in order for the disrupted material to enhance the flux density , the gas must reach a radius of a few schwarzschild radii to contribute to the accretion flow and/or enhance jet power . the free - fall time from @xmath63 is @xmath64 yr . if a fraction @xmath65 of the material were on a plunging orbit due to tidal disruption or a spread in orbital characteristics , we would have expected an enhancement of the overall flux density during these observations .",
    "the flux density should scale as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a model - dependent constant for jet and accretion disk models . for a g2 mass of @xmath68 appropriate for the gas - cloud model and a steady - state accretion rate onto sgr  a *  of @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , we find @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "that is , very little of g2 s mass has yet accreted directly onto the black hole .",
    "longer term monitoring ( 10 yr ) will be sensitive to @xmath73 reaching the black hole through an increase of the average flux density .",
    "the bulk of the material is more likely to accrete on the viscous time scale , @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 , where @xmath76  1 is the viscous parameter and @xmath27 is the height at radius @xmath77 . for reasonable parameters , @xmath78  100 yr",
    ". continued monitoring of the radio through millimeter flux densities can constrain further the properties and origin of g2 as well as the properties of the accretion flow at large radii .    the long - term stability of the radio / millimeter spectrum",
    "indicates that episodic events such as a fully disrupted cloud falling onto the black hole are rare .",
    "such cloud disruptions may take place but they must have timescales that are long compared to the free - fall time .    we confirm a flat spectrum for sgr  a *  emission in the millimeter / submillimeter regime . the emission is likely to originate from a stratified region with optical depth in transition between optically thick and thin .",
    "optically thick emission at frequencies of @xmath79 ghz may influence images obtained with the event horizon telescope @xcite .",
    "accretion disk models with tilted disks and/or high ratios of ion to electron temperature produce larger regions with optical depth greater than 1 @xcite .",
    "higher optical depths may obscure or complicate the interpretation of gravitational lensing effects such as the black hole shadow .",
    "on the other hand , higher optical depth in regions that are offset from the black hole as expected from doppler boosting may enhance the contrast associated with geometric features .",
    "new alma measurements of the spectrum at frequencies from 100 to 950 ghz can resolve the uncertainty in the spectrum between the submillimeter and the nir regime and assist in optimization of eht observations .",
