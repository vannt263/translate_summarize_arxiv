    "since last few decades one can observe a common pursuit towards miniaturization of electronic systems . according to the empirical moore s law",
    ", the number of transistors per microchip is doubled every two years .",
    "it is however obvious that the possibility of further miniaturization will be stopped in the near future due to the loss of chips stability when the device components achieve critical dimensions in the nanometer range .",
    "thus , the most challenging task facing contemporary science and technology is to implement structures , alternative to the silicon - based devices , whose size could be reduced further .    the same tendency can also be observed in the development of hard discs , whose memory cells become smaller and smaller every year .",
    "this generates new challenges related to information reading / writing .",
    "an important step towards further miniaturization was the discovery of the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) effect .",
    "the gmr was discovered in 1988 in artificially layered metallic structures consisting of ferromagnetic 3d films separated by nonmagnetic metallic layers @xcite .",
    "it turned out that electrical resistance of magnetic metallic multilayers depends on their magnetic state , and usually drops when magnetic configuration varies from antiparallel alignment to the parallel one @xcite .",
    "the gmr effect occurs for current flowing in the film plane as well as perpendicularly to it .",
    "this phenomenon turned out to be very useful for applications in highly sensitive read heads , and allowed reading information from smaller memory cells using their weak magnetic field .",
    "the discovery of gmr initiated broad interest in spin polarized electronic transport in nanoscopic systems .",
    "it turned out that electron spin provides an additional degree of freedom , which considerably broadens the range of applications of mesoscopic systems in novel electronic devices . the spin - based nanoelectronics ",
    "called now spin electronics or shortly spintronics  is a relatively new area of mesoscopic physics dealing with the interplay of charge and spin degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "although a lot of theoretical and experimental works on the spintronic properties of mesoscopic systems have been carried out , this field is still in an early stage of development .",
    "an effect similar to the aforementioned gmr also occurs when nonmagnetic metallic layer in a trilayer structure is replaced with a nonmagnetic insulating barrier , and the current flows owing to the phenomenon of quantum - mechanical tunnelling through the barrier .",
    "this effect was discovered in 1975 in ferromagnetic planar junctions by jullire @xcite , and is of current interest due to applications in magnetic storage technology ( magnetic random access memories ) and in spin - electronics devices @xcite . as in the case of gmr ,",
    "the tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) consists in a decrease ( increase is also possible ) in the junction resistance when magnetic configuration of the junction changes from the antiparallel to parallel one .",
    "tunneling in complex junctions , particularly in mesoscopic ones , where charging effects become important , is still not fully explored . a specific kind of such systems are double - barrier junctions with a small central electrode ( called an island ) .",
    "such systems are known as single - electron transistors ( sets ) , mainly because electrons in a biased device flow one by one through the system and the transfer of single electrons can be controlled by a gate voltage .",
    "electronic transport in such devices was extensively studied in the past decade , but mainly in the nonmagnetic limit @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on magnetic nano - structured materials revealed new phenomena associated with the interplay of ferromagnetism and discrete charging effects .",
    "a typical example is a ferromagnetic single - electron transistor , i.e. , a small metallic nanoparticle ( semiconducting quantum dots or molecules are also possible ) coupled by tunnel barriers to ferromagnetic electrodes @xcite .",
    "first ferromagnetic single - electron transistors were fabricated by ono et al .",
    "@xcite and later by brckl et al .",
    "transport in ferromagnetic single - electron transistors with nonmagnetic metallic islands ",
    "both normal and superconducting  was also measured @xcite .",
    "one should bear in mind , that the interplay of spin and charge effects was already studied long time ago in granular systems , in which magnetic nanoparticles were randomly dispersed in a nonmagnetic matrix @xcite .",
    "recently granular films were investigated again by several groups @xcite , but both the size of the grains and also their location were strictly controlled .    in the case of sufficiently large metallic islands ( but still in the nanometer range ) , discrete structure of the electronic states in the grain is not resolved and is irrelevant . to observe the discrete electronic states in transport characteristics one should either diminish size of the metallic nanoparticles @xcite , or use semiconducting quantum dots based on two - dimensional electron gas @xcite .",
    "an alternative strategy is to use ferromagnetic semiconducting materials instead of metallic ones as the electrodes @xcite .",
    "magnetic impurities in the middle of the tunnel barrier of a ferromagnetic tunnel junction @xcite also can be considered as quantum dots with a very strong coulomb interaction .",
    "another group of single - electron devices are molecular ferromagnetic transistors @xcite and , especially , ferromagnetically contacted carbon nanotubes @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will review basic transport characteristics of ferromagnetic single - electron transistors in the sequential tunnelling , cotunneling , and strong coupling ( kondo ) regimes .",
    "in particular , we will consider such properties of the device like charge and spin currents , tunnel magnetoresistance , spin accumulation , shot noise , kondo effect , and others . in section 2",
    "we review basic principles of single - electron transport in the case of a large metallic island attached to ferromagnetic leads .",
    "the size of the island is however small enough so that the charging energy is the dominant energy scale in the system .",
    "the limits of fast and slow spin relaxation in the island are also discussed .",
    "then we consider shot noise and the role of discrete electronic structure in such devices . in section 3",
    "we consider devices based on double metallic islands . in turn , in section 4 we deal with electronic transport through single - level quantum dots ( qds ) in the sequential tunnelling and cotunneling regimes .",
    "transport through multi - level qds , including transport through two - level quantum dots and carbon nanotubes attached to ferromagnetic leads is discussed in section 5 .",
    "transport through quantum dots in the kondo regime is briefly addressed in section 6 .",
    "final conclusions are in section 7 .      the systems considered in this review consist of a mesoscopic central part ( island ) coupled by tunnel barriers to external ferromagnetic leads .",
    "the central part is characterized by an addition energy , which corresponds to the energy needed for adding a single electron , and includes contributions from the electrostatic charging energy and the discrete single - particle level separation . if the charging energy is the most relevant energy scale , the systems exhibit the single - electron charging effects @xcite .",
    "an electron can tunnel to the central part only when the energy provided by the transport voltage surpasses the corresponding charging energy ; otherwise , the current is exponentially suppressed and the system is in the coulomb blockade regime @xcite .",
    "once the bias voltage is larger than the threshold voltage , the electrons can tunnel one by one through the system leading to the step - like current - voltage characteristics ",
    "so - called coulomb staircase .",
    "the blockade can also be overcome by applying a gate voltage @xmath0 that leads to sawtooth - like variation of electric current with @xmath0  so - called coulomb oscillations @xcite .",
    "when the electrodes are made of a ferromagnetic material , the system exhibits further interesting phenomena resulting from the interplay of charge and spin degrees of freedom @xcite . in particular , the tunnelling current flowing through the system depends on the relative alignment of the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic electrodes , giving rise to the tmr effect @xcite , which is described quantitatively by the ratio @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the total system resistance in the parallel and antiparallel magnetic configurations , respectively , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the corresponding currents .",
    "a simple theoretical model of tmr was introduced by jullire @xcite , who considered a single planar ferromagnetic tunnel junction and showed that tmr in such a device is given by @xmath6 , where the spin polarization @xmath7 of the lead @xmath8 ( @xmath9 for the left / right lead ) is defined as @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the spin - dependent density of states of lead @xmath8 for the spin - majority @xmath12 and spin - minority @xmath13 electrons .     a sketch illustrating ( a ) a single first - order ( sequential tunnelling ) process , and ( b ) a second - order ( cotunneling ) transport process . ]      in the following considerations we will distinguish between the three different transport regimes :    _ sequential tunnelling _  in the regime of weak coupling between the island and leads , and out of the coulomb blockade , electron transport is dominated by processes of the first order in the coupling parameter .",
    "electrons flow then consecutively one by one due to the tunnelling events , and the transition rate from an initial state @xmath14 to a final state @xmath15 can be determined from the fermi golden - rule , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the relevant tunnelling hamiltonian , and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the energy of the initial ( final ) state .",
    "this transport regime is known as the sequential tunnelling regime @xcite .",
    "an example of a single first - order process is sketched in fig .",
    "[ sec1:fig1]a .",
    "_ cotunneling _  although the sequential tunnelling in the coulomb blockade regime is exponentially suppressed , the current still flows due to higher - order tunnelling processes involving tunnelling of a single , two or more electrons _ via _ intermediate virtual states @xcite .",
    "these processes are known as cotunneling .",
    "an exemplary cotunneling process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sec1:fig1]b .",
    "the second order perturbation theory gives the cotunneling rate from an initial state @xmath14 to a final state @xmath15 @xcite @xmath20 where the summation is over all virtual states @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the energy od the state @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "in the coulomb blockade regime this tunnelling rate is only algebraically suppressed , contrary to the sequential transport processes which are then suppressed exponentially .",
    "because of that even at low temperatures and in the strong coulomb blockade regime the rates of cotunneling processes do not vanish .",
    "the second - order corrections become also important on resonance for intermediate coupling strengths .    _",
    "strong coupling _  for strong coupling of the metallic island to electrodes , the tunnelling processes lead to logarithmic corrections to conductance , and the perturbation theory fails at the degeneracy points of two consecutive charge states . in the case of quantum dots additionally the kondo effect appears at low temperatures ( below the kondo temperature @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) leading to an enhanced conductance in the linear response regime @xcite .",
    "in this section we review spin - polarized transport in a metallic ferromagnetic single - electron transistor ( fm set ) .",
    "the device consists of a metallic nanoparticle as the central electrode ( island ) , which is coupled through tunnel barriers to external reservoirs of spin polarized electrons .",
    "a gate voltage is attached capacitively to the island , which allows to control position of the corresponding fermi level .",
    "electronic transport in nonmagnetic sets was already extensively studied in the past two decades @xcite .",
    "recently , the attention was also drawn to electron tunnelling in magnetic systems @xcite , which was stimulated by recent progress in nanotechnology .",
    "it has been shown theoretically that some qualitatively new effects may arise from the interplay of charging effects and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "these include , for example , oscillations of tmr with increasing bias voltage , spin accumulation , enhancement of tmr in the coulomb blockade regime , etc . @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of tmr in the cotunneling regime and the oscillations of tmr as a function of the transport voltage have also been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the capacitance @xmath27 of few - nanometer - size particles is of the order of @xmath28 f @xcite .",
    "consequently , the corresponding charging energy , @xmath29 , establishes a new relevant energy scale .",
    "if the charging energy is larger than the thermal energy , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes temperature and @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant , the effects due to discreteness of charge become observable in transport characteristics @xcite .",
    "the single - electron transistors considered in this section are illustrated schematically in fig .",

    "however , we focuss on systems whose moments form either parallel ( p ) or antiparallel ( ap ) magnetic configuration , as shown in fig .  [ sec2:fig1 ] . in the system shown in part ( a ) the magnetic moments of external electrodes point in the same direction , while magnetic moment of the island is either parallel or antiparallel to them . in the system shown in part ( b ) ,",
    "magnetic moments of external electrodes in the parallel configuration are aligned , while in the antiparallel configuration they are anti - aligned .",
    "the two magnetic alignments can be easily achieved by sweeping magnetic field through the hysteresis loop , provided the respective ferromagnetic components have different coercive fields .",
    "one may also make use of exchange anisotropy to fix magnetic moment of a particular layer and rotate magnetic moment of the second layer with a weak magnetic field .",
    "generally , there is a chance that electron tunnelling through a barrier will change its spin orientation .",
    "however , we consider only spin - conserving tunnelling processes through the two barriers .",
    "first , we assume that the islands are relatively large , so the effects due to quantization of the corresponding energy levels can be neglected . for smaller islands , however , the discrete energy spectrum may modify transport characteristics @xcite , and this will be considered later ( see section [ discreteset ] ) .",

    "[ sec2:fig3]a , behavior of the fermi level splitting with increasing transport voltage can be decomposed into two components .",

    "it is interesting to note , that tmr can change sign in the vicinity of the coulomb steps in current - voltage curves , which is a consequence of different spin accumulations in the two magnetic configurations .    generally , it is more difficult to obey the slow spin relaxation limit in ferromagnetic islands than in nonmagnetic ones .",
    "anyway , some experimental data show that this is achievable . in such a case",
    ", the spin accumulation builds up in the magnetic island and has significant influence on transport characteristics . in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that spin accumulation modifies the staircase-like variation of the electric current with the bias voltage .",
    "since the spin accumulation depends on the magnetic configuration of the junction , this can also lead to an enhanced tmr effect .",
    "moreover , in some voltage regions tmr can change sign . in addition , the coulomb steps for the two magnetic configurations become slightly shifted , as was also observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the difference between current - voltage curves in the fast and slow spin relaxation limits varies continuously with spin relaxation rates .",
    "this difference was used very recently to evaluate spin relaxation time in co nanoparticles @xcite .      the electric current and spin accumulation in the limit of sequential tunnelling ( see the preceding subsection ) are exponentially small in the coulomb blockade regime . however , charge transport may occur not only due to spin - dependent sequential tunnelling , but also due to spin - dependent cotunneling processes @xcite , which give dominant contribution in the coulomb blockade regime and also lead to spin accumulation @xcite .",
    "close to resonance ( in the vicinity of the threshold voltage ) both sequential and cotunneling currents may be comparable .",

    "the fano factor depends on the polarization factor @xmath196 ( differently in the two configurations , in general ) . if @xmath521 , the fano factor becomes divergent due to the thermal noise , which dominates in this transport regime ; in the case of @xmath343 , the noise is given by @xmath522 , with @xmath523 being the linear conductance , leading to a divergency of the fano factor @xcite .",

    "the blockade region ( 2 ) , @xmath532 , is associated with the occupation of the states @xmath531 and @xmath533 .",
    "the current is then prohibited due to the full occupation of the single - particle spin - down states .",
    "when increasing the bias voltage further , @xmath534 , the blockade of the current becomes suppressed [ see the plateau between regions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in fig .  [ sec7fig:5](a ) ] , which is due to a finite occupation of state @xmath535 .",
    "although tunnelling of spin - down electrons is then blocked , the current is still carried by spin - up electrons . in turn , the blockade region ( 3 ) occurs for @xmath536 , where the dot is in the triplet state @xmath537 and tunnelling is also suppressed .",
    "thus , the current is blocked when the total dot spin @xmath538 is either @xmath539 or @xmath540 , i.e. , the spin of electrons on the dot is opposite to that of electrons in the half - metallic lead .",
    "there is no suppression of current for negative voltage .",
    "this is because the electrons residing in the dot can always tunnel to the nonmagnetic drain electrode .",
    "it is also interesting to note that a pure triplet state is formed in the region ( 3 ) @xcite .    the current blockade in the regions ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) in fig .",
    "[ sec7fig:5](a ) for positive bias is not due to the charging effects as in the coulomb blockade regime , but due to a particular occupation of the dot spin state .",
    "such blockade is frequently referred to as the pauli spin blockade , and has already been found in single - dot and double - dot systems @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the current blockade in fig .",
    "[ sec7fig:5](a ) is not complete  there is a small leakage current in each blockade region , which results from the fact that the assumed spin polarization of the half - metallic lead is not exactly equal to unity .",
    "when spin polarization is increased , the current in the blockade regions decreases ( compare the curves for @xmath541 and @xmath542 ) .",
    "the spin blockade of charge current leads to the super - poissonian shot noise , i.e. , the corresponding fano factor is larger than unity . on the other hand ,",

    "[ sec7fig:5](b ) .",
    "the enhancement of the shot noise in the pauli blockade regions is a consequence of large spin asymmetry in the tunnelling processes .",
    "the occurrence of a spin - down electron on the dot prevents further tunnelling processes for a longer time , while spin - up electrons on the dot can escape much faster , allowing further tunnelling processes .",
    "this bunching of fast tunnelling processes gives rise to large current fluctuations , and consequently also to fano factors much larger than unity .",
    "recently an interacting three - terminal quantum dot with ferromagnetic leads was considered in ref .",
    "the dot operated as a beam splitter - one contact was a source and the other two acted as drains .",
    "the authors found a dynamical spin blockade ( spin - dependent bunching of tunnelling events ) and positive zero - frequency cross - correlations of the current in the drain electrodes .      in all transport characteristics discussed above only sequential tunnelling processes",
    "were taken into account , while higher order processes , in particular the cotunneling ones , have been neglected . from our discussion on single - level dots we already know that higher order contributions are particularly pronounced in the blockade regions , where they have a significant influence on tmr and fano factor .",
    "the role of cotunneling processes in two - level dots was studied in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "it has been shown there that the cotunneling processes lead to a significant enhancement ( or reduction ) of tmr in the blockade regime . outside the blockade regions ,",
    "however , tmr is determined mainly by sequential transport , so the contribution from cotunneling processes is rather minor .",
    "similarly , the cotunneling processes significantly modify the fano factor in the blockade regions , while outside these regions the fano factor is only weakly sensitive to the cotunneling .",
    "more specifically , the fano factor in the blockade regions is reduced in comparison to that obtained in the sequential transport limit . however , it is still larger than one , indicating super - poissonian shot noise in the blockade regime due to bunching of the fastest cotunneling processes .",
    "there is also another interesting phenomenon in the blockade regime , which resembles the zero bias anomaly observed in single - level dots in the antiparallel magnetic configuration .",

    "this effect bears a resemblance to that found in the case of singly occupied one - level quantum dots discussed in previous sections @xcite . here",

    "consequently , the current flows due to both spin - flip and non - spin - flip cotunneling processes .",
    "to understand the mechanism leading to the zero - bias peak , one should bear in mind that in the antiparallel configuration the spin - majority electrons of one lead tunnel to the spin - minority electron band of the other lead .",
    "for example , for positive bias voltage ( electrons tunnel then from the right to left lead ) , the spin-@xmath578 electrons can easily tunnel to the left lead ( the spin-@xmath578 electrons are the majority ones ) , while this is more difficult for the spin-@xmath579 electrons ( they tunnel to the minority electron band ) .",

    "it is clear that the fastest cotunneling processes are the ones involving only the majority spins , i.e. @xmath584 .",

    "similar behavior has also been observed in electronic transport through carbon nanotubes coupled to ferromagnetic leads @xcite .",
    "in this review we addressed certain aspects of electronic transport in mesoscopic tunnel junctions consisting of magnetic metallic nanoparticles , semiconducting quantum dots , or molecules attached to ferromagnetic electrodes .",
    "we are aware that the review does not cover all the problems considered in such systems and many references have not been included .",
    "there are some other aspects of electronic and spin transport which have been omitted .",
    "one of such aspects is spin torque acting on the island and/or electrodes in ferromagnetic single electron transistors based on magnetic metallic nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "another topic omitted in this review is the role of electron coupling to a phonon bath .",
    "such a coupling leads to new interesting phenomena in transport characteristics @xcite .",
    "for instance , the electron - phonon coupling leads to phonon satellite peaks in the differential conductance .",
    "however , the most important spin effects generated by spin - dependent tunnelling through the barriers separating the central part from the ferromagnetic electrodes have been addressed .",
    "we note that spin polarized transport through nanostructures , where the coulomb effects become important , is rapidly developing in recent years .",
    "this applies not only to theoretical part of the subject , but also to the experimental side , where recent progress in nanotechnology allows to attach external leads to individual nanoparticles , quantum dots , and single molecules .",
    "an interesting and new field within this topic is the spintronics based on molecular magnets .",
    "such molecules are good candidates for magnetic memory cells and also are considered as potential candidates for information processing devices .",
    "there is no doubt , that the rapid progress is the physics and technology of spin polarized electronic transport through nanostructures is stimulated by application possibilities in magnetoelectronics , spintronics , and information technology .",
