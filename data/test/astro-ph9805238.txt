    "bias is introduced to reconcile the amplitude of fluctuations inferred from clustering of galaxies with that derived from mass distributions .",
    "bright galaxies seem to have a stronger clustering than that of the underlying mass .",
    "therefore , it is generally believed that galaxies are biased tracers of the mass density field , i.e. it follows the clustering of ( dark ) matter but with an enhanced amplitude .",
    "generally , bias is phenomenologically modeled by a linear relation as @xmath10 where @xmath11/\\bar{n}$ ] , @xmath12/\\bar{\\rho}$ ] , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , the galaxy number density distribution and density field of dark matter , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the average of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the phenomenological bias parameter @xmath1 is assumed to be constant , but may be different for different galaxy types , say , @xmath17 , @xmath18 for early and late types of galaxies .",
    "eq.(1 ) and its variants are widely used in the determination of cosmological parameters from samples of redshift surveys of galaxies . however , we have really very little idea about which the bias parameter @xmath1 should be .",
    "in fact , both bias ( @xmath19 ) and anti - bias ( @xmath20 ) are employed in current data analysis ( e.g. mo , jing & white 1996 . )",
    "this prevents unambiguous measures of cosmological parameters , giving only bias - contaminated results .",
    "theoretically , the physical mechanism responsible for relation ( 1 ) is far from clear .",
    "the first analytic model of bias , in which objects are identified with high peaks or collapsed halos of the density field , offers a plausible explanation of the bias of galaxy clusters  the correlation amplitudes of clusters are strong functions of cluster richness ( kaiser 1984 ) . in this case ,",
    "bias is mainly caused by the mass of collapsed halos .",
    "the larger the mass of the halo , the higher the richness of the cluster .    yet",
    ", the formation of galaxies does nt depend only on the mass , or local mass density , of collapsed halos , but is substantially modulated by various environmental effects , such as the suppression of star formation in neighboring protogalaxies ( rees 1985 ) , stimulating the formation of nearby galaxies ( dekel & rees 1987 ) , dynamical friction effects ( couchman & carlberg 1992 ) , etc .",
    "all these environmental effects are beyond local density , and lead to a non - local relation between the number density of galaxies and the background mass field ( bower et al . 1993 ) .",
    "moreover , the rate of star formation is most likely non - linearly dependent on local mass density .",
    "a common result of the non - local and/or non - linear relation between @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the scale - dependence of parameter @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , to have a deep understanding of the mechanism of galaxy bias , searching for the scale - dependence of parameter @xmath1 is necessary ( coles 1993 , catelan et al . 1994",
    ")    so far , the results of detecting @xmath1 scale - dependence are quite scattered .",
    "for instance , the values of the bias - contaminated density parameter @xmath23 are found to be in the range of 0.4 - 1 , and equal to about @xmath24 at gaussian smoothing scales of 3 - 6 h@xmath25mpc , and @xmath26 on scales of @xmath27 h@xmath25mpc ( e.g. dekel , burstein & white 1996 ) .",
    "this is , @xmath1 is probably scale - dependent from 6 to 12 h@xmath25 mpc . on the other hand ,",
    "some studies conclude that for galaxies of all types and luminosities the scale dependence of the bias parameter is weak ( e.g. kauffmann , nusser & steinmetz 1997 ) .",
    "why different detections gave different conclusions ?",
    "this question motivated us to study the physics included in eq.(1 ) .",
    "in the first part of this paper , we show that even in linear bias model , the behavior of scale - dependence can not be described by one parameter @xmath1 , but by a series of @xmath4-spectra of wavelet - coefficient - represented bias parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 being positive integers .",
    "the @xmath4-spectra of @xmath5 are all statistically _ independent_. _ different _ detections may actually measure _ different _ parameters @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , it should not be surprised that some detections are positive , and some negative . the different behavior of bias scale - dependence given by different detection does not cause confusion , but may greatly be helpful to reveal the physics behind the bias model ( 1 ) . therefore , to have a complete picture of bias scale - dependence a systematic analysis of the @xmath4-spectra of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is necessary .    in the second part",
    ", we performed a systematic detection of the bias scale - dependence with the samples of galaxies listed in the apm bright galaxies catalog ( apm - bgc ) .",
    "this analysis shows that for the apm - bgc sample , the scale - independence approximately holds if only the two - point correlation function and power spectrum are involved , while the scale - dependence becomes substantial when higher order or phase - sensitive statistics involved .",
    "this result is worth to constrain models of hierarchical clustering of galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly introduce a method of the space - scale decomposition based on discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) analysis . with this method , various statistics of measuring the bias scale dependence are developed and presented .",
    " 3 describes the sample to be analyzed . in ",
    "4 we apply the dwt method to analyze the galaxy sample of the apm bright galaxies",
    ". the implications of these results are discussed in  5 .",
    "let us briefly introduce the dwt analysis of large scale structures , for the details referring to ( fang & pando 1997 , pando & fang 1996 , 1998 . )",
    "we consider here a 1-d mass density distribution @xmath29 or contrast @xmath30/\\bar{\\rho}$ ] , which are mathematically random fields over a spatial range @xmath31 .",
    "it is not difficult to extend all results developed in this section into 2-d and 3-d because the dwt bases for higher dimension can be constructed by a direct product of 1-d bases .",
    "like the fourier expansion of the field @xmath32 , the dwt expansion of the field @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the bases of the dwt . because these bases are orthogonal and complete , the wavelet function coefficient ( wfc ) , @xmath37 , is computed by @xmath38    the wavelet transform bases @xmath34 are generated from the basic wavelet @xmath39 by a dilation @xmath40 , and a translation @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 the basic wavelet @xmath43 is designed to be continuous , admissible and localized .",
    "unlike the fourier bases @xmath44 , which are non - local in physical space , the wavelet bases @xmath34 are localized in both physical space and fourier ( scale ) space . in physical space , @xmath34 is centered at position @xmath45 , and in fourier space , it is centered at wavenumber @xmath46 . therefore , the dwt decomposes the density fluctuating field @xmath32 into domains @xmath47 in phase space , and for each basis the corresponding area in the phase space is as small as that allowed by the uncertainty principle .",
    "wfc @xmath37 and its intensity @xmath48 describe , respectively , the fluctuation of density and its power on scale @xmath49 at position @xmath45 .    in order to have reasonable statistics , the cosmic density field is usually assumed to be ergodic : the average over an ensemble is equal to the spatial average taken over one realization .",
    "this is the so - called ",
    "fair sample hypothesis \" ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "a homogeneous gaussian field with continuous spectrum is certainly ergodic ( adler 1981 ) . in some non - gaussian cases , such as homogeneous and isotropic turbulence ( vanmarke , 1983 ) , ergodicity also approximately holds .",
    "roughly , the ergodic hypothesis is reasonable if spatial correlations are decreasing sufficiently rapidly with increasing separation .",
    "the volumes separated with distances larger than the correlation length are approximately statistically independent . in this case ,",
    "wfcs , @xmath37 , at different @xmath41 from one realization of @xmath32 can be employed as statistically independent measurement .",
    "thus , the wfcs of @xmath32 at different @xmath41 on a given @xmath4 , @xmath37 , form an ensemble of the wfcs on the scale @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , when the  fair sample hypothesis \" holds , an average over ensemble can be fairly estimated by average over @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes ensemble average .      using the completeness of the dwt basis , one can reconstruct the original density field from the coefficient @xmath37 . to achieve this",
    ", dwt analysis employs another set of functions consisting of the so - called scaling functions , @xmath52 , which are generated from the basic scaling @xmath53 by a dilation @xmath40 , and a translation @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath54 the basic scaling @xmath55 is essentially a window function with width @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the scaling functions @xmath57 are also windows , but with width @xmath58 , and centered at @xmath45 .",
    "the scaling functions @xmath57 are orthogonal with respect to the index @xmath41 , but not for @xmath4 .",
    "this is a common property of window functions , which can be orthogonal in physical space , but not in fourier space .    for daubechies wavelets , the basic wavelet and the basic scaling",
    "are related by recursive equations as ( daubechies 1992 ) @xmath59 where coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath61 are different for different wavelet . in this paper",
    ", we use the daubechies 4 wavelet ( d4 ) , for which @xmath62 .    from eq.(6 )",
    ", one can show that the scaling functions @xmath57 are always orthogonal to the wavelet bases @xmath63 if @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 therefore , @xmath57 can be expressed by @xmath63 as @xmath66 the coefficients @xmath67 can be determined from @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    using @xmath57",
    ", we construct a density field on scale @xmath4 as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is called the scaling function coefficient ( sfc ) given by @xmath70 since the scaling function @xmath57 is window - like , the coefficient @xmath69 is actually a ",
    "count - in - cell \" in a window on scale @xmath4 at position @xmath41 .    using eqs.(2 ) , ( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , one can find @xmath71 namely , @xmath72 contains all terms of density fluctuations @xmath73 of @xmath74 , but not terms of @xmath75 . from eqs.(2 ) and ( 11 ) , we have @xmath76 one can also define the smoothed density contrasts on scale @xmath4 to be @xmath77 eqs.(12 ) and ( 13 ) show that @xmath72 and @xmath78 are the density field smoothed on scale @xmath4 . using eqs.(12 ) and ( 13 ) , one can construct the density field @xmath72 or @xmath79 on finer and finer scales by wfcs @xmath37 till to the precision of the original field . since the sets of bases @xmath80 and @xmath52 are complete , the original field can be reconstructed without lost information .",
    "we subject the dwt decomposition on eq.(1 ) which gives @xmath81 statistically , eq.(14 ) means that the one - point distributions of the wfcs for galaxies should be proportional to the matter , and the proportional coefficient @xmath1 is @xmath4-independent .",
    "thus , linear bias models eq.(1 ) requires that various statistics based on the wfc one - point distributions for galaxies and matter should satisfy the linear relations given by eq.(14 ) .    if we define the cumulant moment of the one - point distribution of @xmath37 as @xmath82 the model ( 1 ) is actually to require that the ratios @xmath83 should be @xmath4(scale)-independent for all order @xmath7 .",
    "namely , @xmath84 should be @xmath4-independent . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath4-spectra of @xmath5 are flat . for non - gaussian fields , the parameters @xmath5 for different @xmath7 generally are statistically independent .",
    "therefore , the behavior of bias scale - dependence can not be described by one parameter @xmath1 , but the @xmath4-spectra of @xmath5 for all @xmath7 .    from eqs.(13 ) and ( 14 ) , one has @xmath85 eq.(17 ) can be rewritten as @xmath86\\ ] ] where constant @xmath87 . considering that @xmath88 is independent of index @xmath41 , the dwt decomposition of eq.(18 ) gives @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the mean of the sfcs on scale @xmath4 .",
    "similar to eq.(16 ) , one can design statistics @xmath91 as follows @xmath92 if bias is scale - independent , the @xmath4-spectra of @xmath91 should also be flat .    in a word ,",
    "the scale - dependence of bias is described by the @xmath4 spectra of parameters @xmath5 and @xmath91 .",
    "it is possible that some @xmath4-spectra are flat , but others non - flat .",
    "therefore , to study bias scale - dependence , it is necessary to take a systematic detection of the @xmath4-spectra of @xmath5 and @xmath91 .",
    "a physical reason of choosing @xmath5 and @xmath91 to detect scale - dependence of bias is from non - gaussianity of mass density fields .",
    "the structure formation due to gravitational clustering can roughly be divided into three stages : linear , quasilinear and fully developed nonlinear .",
    "it is obvious from eq.(1 ) that the linear evolution of @xmath93 and @xmath94 do not cause bias scale - dependence .",
    "it is generally believed that the evolution of cosmic clustering on very large scales is probably still remaining in linear stage at present .",
    "therefore , the bias parameter should be scale - independent on very large scales if the initial @xmath1 is scale - independent .    on scales from about 5 - 10",
    "h@xmath25 mpc , the cosmic gravitational clustering may also be not fully developed yet , but partially in the quasilinear regime . in this case",
    ", the power spectrum of density perturbations is not significantly different from linear power spectrum , but is characterized by power transfer via mode coupling .",
    "the power transfer among perturbations on different scales will give rise to a scale dependence of bias .",
    "on the other hand , power transfer also leads to non - gaussianity of the density fields .",
    "therefore , the bias scale - dependence in the range of 5 - 10 h@xmath25 mpc may not easily be detected by methods insensitive to non - gaussianity , such as power spectrum or two - point correlation function , but by statistics sensitive to non - gaussianity .",
    "the statistics @xmath5 and @xmath91 are non - gaussian sensitive , and therefore , suitable to detect the bias scale - dependence caused by non - gaussian process .    it has been shown that the @xmath95 statistics of @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath97 , essentially is the fourier power spectrum .",
    "therefore a gaussian random field can be completely described by its dwt power spectrum @xmath97 ( pando & fang , 1998 . )",
    "higher order ( @xmath9 ) statistics of @xmath98 are sensitive to non - gaussianity of the density fields .",
    "for instance , the @xmath99 3 , 4 , statistics of @xmath98 can be rewritten as @xmath100 therefore , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are essentially the same as the statistics of skewness and kurtosis .",
    "this point can directly be seen from the definition of the skewness and kurtosis of density contrast distribution @xmath32 .",
    "they are @xmath103 where @xmath104 , and @xmath105",
    ". therefore , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the @xmath4-spectra of @xmath106 and @xmath107 .    for gaussian fields @xmath32 , all the cumulant moments @xmath108 or @xmath109 are equal to zero , only except second order @xmath110 or @xmath111 ( fang & pando 1997 .",
    ") thus , all statistics @xmath5 of @xmath9 are good for detecting the scale - dependence of bias related to non - gaussian processes .",
    "the statistics of the sfcs @xmath69 are different from the wfcs @xmath37 . as mentioned in  2.3 , the scaling functions @xmath57",
    "are window - like functions .",
    "sfcs are similar to the statistics of count in cell ( cic ) .",
    "the dwt scaling functions @xmath57 correspond to the cic window functions , and the sfcs of the dwt correspond to the counts of cic . because @xmath57 and the window functions of cic are not orthogonal with respect to @xmath4 ( or scale . ) , the sfcs , @xmath69 , are given by a superposition of wfcs , @xmath112 and @xmath113 [ see , eqs.(8 ) , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) ] .",
    "namely , for any order of @xmath7 , statistics based on sfcs are always sensitive to the location , or the phases of perturbations on different scales , i.e. sensitive to non - gaussianity .",
    "thus , regardless whether @xmath7 is larger than 2 , @xmath91 are always useful to detect the scale - dependence of bias related to non - gaussian processes .",
    "neither @xmath5 nor @xmath91 are directly testable because we do nt know the distribution of dark matter @xmath114 .",
    "but , bias scale - dependence can be revealed from the difference between the scale behaviors of the galaxies with different internal properties .",
    "it has been very well known that the relative abundances of galaxies with different morphology are environment dependent ( dressler 1980 ) , the clustering strength of galaxies is luminosity dependent ( xia , deng & zhou 1987 ) , and the correlation amplitudes of optically selected galaxies are different from that of infrared selected ( saunders , rowan - robinson & lawrence 1992 , strauss et al .",
    "therefore , it is most likely that galaxies with different morphology possess different scale - dependence of bias .",
    "thus , the bias scale - dependence might be detected by comparing the @xmath4-spectra of @xmath115 and @xmath116 for galaxies with different morphology .",
    "let us consider two types of galaxies , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , both of which obey linear model ( 1 ) with different parameter @xmath1 .",
    "all statistics of eqs.(15 ) and ( 20 ) are available by replacing @xmath119 by @xmath120 .",
    "namely , the scale dependence of bias can be revealed by @xmath4-spectrum of @xmath5 and @xmath121 defined as @xmath122 @xmath123 any non - flatness of these @xmath4-spectra indicates that the bias is scale - dependent for at least one type of the considered galaxies .",
    "we analyzed the samples of galaxies listed in the apm bright galaxies catalog ( loveday , 1996 ) , which gives positions , magnitudes and morphological types of 14,681 galaxies brighter than 16@xmath124.44 over a 4,180 deg@xmath125 area in 180 schmidt survey fields of south sky .",
    "the completeness is about 96.3 per cent with a standard deviation 1.9 per cent inferred from carefully checked 12 fields .",
    "therefore , it is large and uniform enough for a 2-d dwt analysis .",
    "we choose the early type or elliptical and lenticular ( el ) galaxies as @xmath117 , and late type or spiral ( sp ) galaxies as @xmath118 .",
    "all the elliptical and lenticular galaxies are compiled into one sample containing 4,439 els .",
    "the sp sample contains 8,217 sp galaxies .    in order to do a 2-d dwt analysis",
    ", we chose three fields s1 , s2 and s3 from the entire survey area .",
    "the three fields are selected to be square on a equal area projection of the sky .",
    "the equal area projection keeps the surface number density of the galaxies in the plane to be the same as on the sky .",
    "the sizes of s1 , s2 and s3 are taken to be as large as possible covering the whole area of the survey . the whole survey and the three fields s1 , s2 and s3",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "each field has angular size of about 37@xmath126 .",
    "s1 , s2 and s3 contain 1,095 , 1,039 , and 1,055 els , and 2,186 , 2,188 , and 2,092 sps , respectively .",
    "the galaxies in the regions s1 and s3 are completely independent .",
    "s2 has some overlaps with s1 and s3 .",
    "we divide each square region into 2@xmath127 @xmath128 2@xmath127 ( 1024@xmath129 ) cells labelled by @xmath130 , and @xmath131 , @xmath132 being an integer from @xmath133 to 1023 . using the estimation of the mean depth of the sample given by the luminosity function from the stromlo - apm redshift survey ( loveday et al .",
    "1992 ) , one find that the cell size is about 65 h@xmath25kpc , which is fine enough to detect statistical features on scales larger than 1 h@xmath25mpc .",
    "the distribution of the galaxies in the sample can be described by a 2-d density field @xmath13 or contrast @xmath134 , where @xmath135 . in doing 2-d dwt analysis of @xmath13 or @xmath134 ,",
    "the wavelet functions and the scaling functions are constructed from direct product of the 1-d bases , i.e. @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 . for scale",
    "@xmath4 , the angular scale is @xmath140 in unit of a cell . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in scales of @xmath141 and 3 , corresponding to spatial scales of about 0.26 , 0.52 , 1.04 , 2.08 , 4.16 and 8.32 h@xmath25 mpc , respectively .    in doing statistical analysis of the apm - bgc",
    ", the effect of the 1,456 holes drilled around big bright objects should be taken into account .",
    "for instance , random samples are generated in the area with the same drilled holes as that in the original survey .",
    "we also removed a few galaxies placed in the holes drilled .",
    "a common problem of statistics for discrete sample is sampling error , which is , in particular , serious for statistics of non - gaussianity .",
    "even if the original matter field is gaussian , the sampled data must be non - gaussian on scales for which the mean number in one cell is small .",
    "this is the non - gaussianity of shot noise .",
    "any non - gaussian behavior of the density fields will be contaminated by the shot noise .",
    "because of bias might be related to non - gaussian process , the detected result is inevitably contaminated by sampling .",
    "fortunately , the dwt spectrum method is found to be effective for suppressing the contamination of shot noise .",
    "it has been shown that the non - gaussianity of shot noise is significant only on scales comparable with the mean distance of nearest neighbors of objects . because the wavelet bases are localized , the central limit theorem guarantees the non - gaussianity of shot noise rapidly and monotonously approaching zero on larger scales ( greiner , lipa & carruthers 1995 , fang & pando 1997 ) . therefore , besides small scales , the behavior of dwt @xmath4-spectrum will not be affected by the shot noise of sampling .",
    "before calculating @xmath28 , we consider the two - point angular correlation functions of the els and sps of the apm - bgc . because the two - point angular correlation function analysis of stromlo - apm redshift survey has been done by loveday et al .",
    "one can show the reliability of the dwt method by comparing our result with the earlier one .",
    "2 shows the angular correlation functions , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , which are obtained from whole sample of the els and sps .",
    "the dotted lines give the 1 @xmath8 error calculated from 20 random samples which are produced by randomizing the positions of the galaxies in the same field with the same drilled holes as the samples .    as usual , these correlation functions show a power law , and the amplitude of the correlation for the els is higher than that of the sps .",
    "this is the well - known segregation of morphology : the clustering of el galaxies is stronger than that of sp ( davis & geller 1976 . )",
    "actually , this is an evidence of bias .",
    "however , fig .",
    "2 shows that the ratio @xmath144 is approximately constant in the angular range of @xmath145 .",
    "namely , the segregation can be explained by linear bias if @xmath146 and @xmath147 are taken to be different constant . in other words , in terms of two - point correlation functions , no scale - dependent bias is needed , or at most a very weak scale - dependence . with the dwt analysis , we are able to measure this scale - dependence more quantitatively .",
    "this result of fig .",
    "2 will not be changed if the error is estimated by bootstrap samples .",
    "this is expected , because the number of galaxy pairs is large , the bootstrap - resampling error is only larger than poissonian error by a factor of 1.7 ( mo , jing & brner 1992 . )",
    "power spectrum is the fourier counterpart of two - point correlation function . as mentioned in  2.4 ,",
    "the second order statistic @xmath150 is equivalent to the measure of fourier power spectrum ( pando & fang 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , one can expected that the second order statistics @xmath151 should show the same results as that given by two - point correlation function .    the 2-d extension of the @xmath95 statistic @xmath151 of eq.(23 ) is @xmath152_{i } } { [ \\sum_{l_1=0}^{2^{j_1}-1}\\sum_{l_2=0}^{2^{j_2}-1 }                            \\tilde{w}_{{\\bf j},{\\bf l}}^2]_{ii}},\\ ] ] in order to estimate the error of @xmath153 , and to avoid the effect of the drilled holes and boundary , we generated 500 randomized samples of the el and sp , and calculated the average @xmath154 and variance from these random samples . fig .",
    "3 plots @xmath148 defined as @xmath155 the variance from the random samples is also plotted in fig .",
    "the @xmath4-spectrum of @xmath148 , indeed , shows flat within 1-@xmath8 , only field s2 has a little higher @xmath148 on large scale @xmath156 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the detection of two - point correlation functions ( loveday et al . 1995 . )",
    "this shows that the dwt power spectrum estimator is reliable ( pando & fang 1998 . )",
    "it has been emphasized in  2.4 that the flatness of the @xmath4-spectrum of the second order statistics @xmath148 does nt imply that other @xmath4-spectra will also be flat , especially in the case that the bias scale - dependence is caused by non - gaussian process . therefore , non - gaussian sensitive statistics are necessary .",
    "fig.4 shows the result of statistics @xmath149 which is defined by @xmath157 where @xmath158_{i } } { [ \\sum_{l_1=0}^{2^{j_1}-1}\\sum_{l_2=0}^{2^{j_2}-1 }                            |\\tilde{w}_{{\\bf j},{\\bf l}}|^3]_{ii}}.\\ ] ] comparing fig.4 with fig.3 , it is clear that the @xmath4-spectra of @xmath149 show more deviation from a flat spectrum .",
    "therefore , the bias scale - dependence might really originate from non - gaussian processes .",
    "a simplest phase - sensitive statistic is the reconstructed distribution @xmath72 [ eq.(9 ) ] , which is given by sfcs .",
    "the 2-d extension of eq.(9 ) is @xmath160 @xmath138 means a reconstruction of the density field on scale @xmath161 in the dimension @xmath162 , and @xmath163 in @xmath164 .",

    "actually , for all @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 are always proportional to the mean number density of galaxies el and sp , respectively , and therefore , the ratio @xmath177 does nt depend on @xmath174 .",

    "fig.5 also shows the underdense regions by light contours corresponding to @xmath180 successivefully from out to inside .",
    "a simplified representation of these fields is shown in fig.6 , in which the dark area represents the overdense regions , @xmath181 , and blank the underdense regions , @xmath182 .",
    "the ratio between the clustering strengths of the el and sp on scale @xmath4 can be measured from fig.6 by @xmath183 similar to the statistic @xmath184 , to estimate the error of @xmath185 , we generated 500 randomized samples of the els and sps , and calculated the average @xmath186 of these random samples .",
    "7 plots the result of statistics @xmath159 defined as @xmath187 the one @xmath8 lines of both randomized and bootstrap re - sampling are also shown in fig.7 .",
    "the two error estimates gave about the same confidence level .",
    "the @xmath4-spectrum of @xmath159 is found to be significantly non - flat .",
    "since @xmath159 is based on statistic @xmath169 , one can expected that the statistic of @xmath189 of eq.(21 ) will give the same conclusion .",
    "the 2-d extension of eq.(21 ) is @xmath190 because for odd @xmath7 , @xmath191 has larger relative errors .",
    "we calculated @xmath192 defined as @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the average of @xmath195 over 500 randomized samples of the els and sps .",
    "the results of @xmath196 for the three fields are given in fig .",
    "the three fields s1 , s2 and s3 show the same feature of the @xmath4 dependence . the mean sfcs and their variance from the randomized samples",
    "are also plotted in fig.8 .",
    "like the statistics @xmath159 , the spectrum of @xmath196 is non - flat with significance larger than 2 @xmath8 .",
    "since 2-d sample of galaxies is a @xmath197 ( redshift ) projection of their 3-d distribution . to study the influence of sample depth on our statistics , we calculated @xmath196 for samples of els and sps with different limit magnitude @xmath198 .",
    "fig.9 plots the result of @xmath199 which is the same as @xmath196 but for sample with limit magnitude @xmath200 . in the case , the numbers of el and sp galaxies are about 20 - 25% less than that of @xmath201 .",
    "the @xmath4-spectra in fig.9 have completely the same features as fig.8 .",
    "therefore , conclusions drawn from fig .",
    "8 are insensitive to the depth of the samples .    in figs.8 and 9",
    ", the @xmath4-dependence of bias is prominent on scales larger than 1 h@xmath25 mpc , i.e. larger than the mean distance of nearest neighbors of galaxies , and therefore , the effect of shot noise is negligible .",
    "we showed that , instead of one parameter @xmath1 , eq.(1 ) introduces a series of parameters @xmath91 and @xmath5 to describe the bias scale - dependence .",
    "the statistics of @xmath5 with different @xmath7 are independent from each others .",
    "the dwt analysis provides a simple and effective tool of systematically detecting the scale - dependence of bias parameters on various orders .",
    "this method is effective to be employed for analyzing galaxy samples which show morphology- and/or luminosity - segregation .    with this method we detected the @xmath4-spectra of @xmath28 and @xmath6 for the distributions of el and sp galaxies of the apm - bgc samples .",
    "the general results indicate that for second order statistics , i.e. two - point correlation function and power spectrum , the bias is approximately scale - independent , but not so for higher order or phase - sensitive ( non - gaussian ) statistics .",
    "the result is consistent with the following fact : most evidences for weak scale dependence of bias are from statistics of the two - point correlation functions and power spectrum ( kauffmann , nusser & steinmetz 1997 ) , while the evidence for scale - dependence is from phase - sensitive statistics ( sigad et al .",
    "1998 ) . therefore",
    ", the scale - dependence of galaxy bias may have the same origin as the non - gaussianity of galaxy distribution .",
    "linear evolution can not cause non - gaussianity of mass distributions if the initial perturbations are gaussian .",
    "the scale - dependence of bias of galaxy distribution is most unlikely due to the non - linear evolution of gravitational clustering , and the non - local relationship between galaxy formation and their environment .    with this in mind",
    ", the information of bias scale - dependence is worth for developing models of galaxy formation . indeed , despite the current detection of bias scale dependence is still very preliminary , the result is already able to set useful constraint on models of hierarchical clustering . in these models ,",
    "galaxy correlations are generally assumed to be described by the hierarchical relation @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the @xmath7-th order correlation function , and @xmath204 are constants ( white 1979 ) . if these hierarchical relations hold exactly , the second order ( two - point ) correlation function plus all constants @xmath204 ( which may be different for different types of galaxies ) completely characterize the clustering of galaxies , including their higher order correlations .",
    "this is , all @xmath205 and @xmath206 can be represented by second order correlation function plus all ( scale - independent ) constants @xmath204 .",
    "hence , if bias is scale - independent on second order , it will be scale - independent on all orders .",
    "therefore , the non - flatness of @xmath4-spectra of @xmath205 and @xmath206 for sample apm - bgc implies that the hierarchical relations may not hold exactly , or the coefficients , @xmath204 , are scale - dependent .",
    "similar conclusion has also been drawn from the detection of the scale - scale correlations of the ly@xmath207 forests of qso absorption spectrum ( pando et al . 1998 . )",
    "thus , the detection of @xmath205 and @xmath206 , joining with other higher order statistics , is effective to reveal the details of the hierarchical clustering scenario .",
