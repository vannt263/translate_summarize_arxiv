    "colloidal semiconductor nanoclusters ( ncs ) have undergone an enormous development in the fields of optoelectronics , spintronics , and bio - labeling over the past two decades .",
    "the good control of the nc size makes it possible to tailor their electronic and optical properties .",
    "many successful applications in these fields were already reported  @xcite .",
    "the experiments are usually performed at room temperature , making the treatment of vibrational properties , especial the anharmonic effects , crucial  @xcite .",
    "a solid understanding of the anharmonic effects of vibrations , is therefore a decisive step for the real world application of nanostructures , where the physical properties such as thermal conductivity in nanowires  @xcite , non - radiative transition via phonon in ncs  @xcite , and raman spectra broadening in nanostructures  @xcite are dominated by the phonon lifetime .",
    "there are basically two approaches to address this problem theoretically .",
    "the first one is to calculate the electron - phonon coupling  @xcite and phonon - phonon coupling  @xcite terms via perturbative approaches .",
    "the temperature effects are subsequently included using the bose - einstein distribution of the lattice vibrations ( phonons ) .",
    "the physical properties , such as spectral broadening , spin - flip , loss of quantum coherence , relaxation of charge carriers , and thermal conductivity have been studied theoretically  @xcite , mostly considering harmonic or quasi - harmonic ( harmonic approximation performed at different volumes ) approximations .",
    "some have considered the third - order and fourth - order derivatives of the total energy  @xcite , but the large computational demand for these higher - order derivatives limit the study to very small nanostructures  @xcite or bulk materials  @xcite . the @xmath2 theorem , on the other hand limits the studies based on density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) to third order process  @xcite .",
    "the second one is to use molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite , where the temperature effects including all anharmonic effects are intrinsically contained in the atomic trajectories of the simulations .",
    "the temperature - dependent vibrational density of states ( dos ) and the thermal conductivity of nanostructures have already been studied using classical molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite .",
    "the required empirical force field potentials are limited by the lack of transferability to different systems and by the inability to correctly predict chemical bonding processes .",
    "these difficulties are overcome in the case of _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) simulations  @xcite , which does not build upon the harmonic approximation but allows for a self - consistent rearrangement of the changes , including all anharmonic effects .",
    "based on the accurately calculated forces from the electronic structure calculations , aimd enables us to monitor the changes in the electronic and vibrational properties on - the - fly , with thermal effects included directly .",
    "although aimd simulations have been successfully applied to study a variety of problems  @xcite , and the phonon lifetime in bulk has been studied using classical molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite , a vibron - vibron interaction extracted from aimd simulation is still lacking .    in this work ,",

    "the former can be linked to the negative ( blue - shift ) and positive ( red - shift ) grneisen parameters along with the extended bond lengths .",
    "the latter is attributed to the low symmetry ( proximity to the surface ) enhancing anharmonic effects at high temperatures .",
    "we further present a computational approach that enables the extraction of inter - vibron coupling strength , taking all the anharmonic effects into account .",

    "<S> we study the temperature dependent dynamical processes of a si@xmath0h@xmath1 cluster and obtain a blue shift of the si - si vibrational modes with transverse acoustic character and a red shift of the other vibrational modes with increasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we link this behavior to the bond length expansion and the varying sign of the grneisen parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we further present a computational approach able to extract the vibron - vibron coupling strength in clusters or molecules . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on _ ab initio _ born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics and a projection formalism able to deliver the individual vibron occupation numbers . from the fourier </S>",
    "<S> transform of the vibron energy autocorrelation function we obtain the coupling strength of each vibron to the most strongly coupled vibronic states . </S>",
    "<S> we find vibron - vibron coupling strength up to 2.5 thz with a moderate increase of about 5% when increasing the temperature from 50 to 150 k. </S>"
