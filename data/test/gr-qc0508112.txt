    "one of the few predictions of the einstein s general theory of relativity ( gtr ) which is still awaiting for a direct and reliable observational check is the so called lense - thirring ( lt ) effect@xcite .",
    "it is a consequence of the off - diagonal components @xmath0 of the space - time metric generated by a weakly gravitating and slowly rotating massive body of mass @xmath1 and proper angular momentum @xmath2 in the linearized weak - field and slow - motion approximation of gtr@xcite .",
    "the mass - energy currents induce , among other things , a lorentz - like , velocity - dependent force which acts on the orbital motion of a test particle freely moving in the gravitational field of the central body .",
    "such force is = -2m()_g , where @xmath3 is the particle s velocity and _ g=.@xmath4 is the newtonian gravitational constant and @xmath5 is the speed of light in vacuum . due to the formal resemblance of @xmath6 with the dipolar magnetic field of the maxwellian electromagnetism , the ensemble of gravitational phenomena induced by the mass currents is named gravitomagnetism@xcite .",
    "it turns out that the non - central gravitomagnetic force of makes the longitude of the ascending node @xmath7 and the argument of pericentre @xmath8 to undergo tiny secular precessions@xcite@xcite = , = -,where @xmath9 are the semimajor axis , the eccentricity and the inclination yto the equator of the orbit of the moving particle , respectively .",
    "the gravitomagnetic phenomena may have strong consequences in many astrophysical and astronomical scenarios involving , e.g. , accreting disks around black holes@xcite , gravitational lensing and time delay@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in these contexts the knowledge of the various competing effects is rather poor and makes very difficult to reliably extract the genuine gravitomagnetic signal from the noisy background .",
    "e.g. , attempts to measure the lt effect around black holes are often confounded by the complexities of the dynamics of the hot gas in their accretion disks .",
    "conversely , if one believes in gtr , the lt effect could be used , in principle , for measuring the proper angular momentum of the central mass which acts as sources of the gravitomagnetic field .",
    "it must be noted that , according to k. nordtvedt , gravitomagnetism would have already been indirectly tested from the radial motion of the earth s geodetic satellite lageos@xcite and from the high - precision reconstruction of the lunar orbit with the lunar laser ranging ( llr ) technique@xcite .",
    "an attempt to directly measure the lt effect in the gravitational field of the earth has been performed by ciufolini and pavlis with the lageos and lageos ii satellites@xcite by using an observable proposed by one of us in ref .  .",
    "the claimed total accuracy is 5 - 10@xmath10 at 1 - 3 sigma , but such estimates have been criticized by one of us in ref .   who proposes a 19 - 24@xmath10 total error at 1-sigma .",
    "the main limiting factors are the systematic errors of gravitational origin due to the static and secularly varying parts of the even zonal coefficients @xmath11 of the multipolar expansion of the terrestrial gravitational potential .",
    "the first , very preliminary , evidence of the gravitomagnetic field of the sun through the lt precessions of the longitudes of the perihelia @xmath12 of the inner planets of the solar system has recently been reported by one if us in ref .  .    in april 2004",
    "the gp - b spacecraft@xcite has been launched .",
    "its aim is the measurement of another gravitomagnetic effect , i.e. the precession of the spins@xcite of four superconducting gyroscopes carried onboard with an expected accuracy of @xmath13 or better .      in this paper",
    "we want to investigate the possibility of measuring the lt effect on the orbits of the galilean satellites io ( 1 ) , europa ( 2 ) , ganymede ( 3 ) and callisto ( 4 ) evolving in the gravitational field of jupiter in view of recent improvements in their ephemerides@xcite .",
    "the orbital parameters of the galilean satellites of jupiter are presented in table [ galpar ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that the idea of using the jovian system was put forth for the first time by lense and thirring themselves in their original paper@xcite .",
    "since the galilean satellites of jupiter move along nearly circular and equatorial orbits and to make easier the comparison with the current ephemerides we will consider the radial , transverse and normal components of their orbits .",
    "their perturbations can be expressed in terms of the integrated shifts of the keplerian orbital elements @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mean anomaly , as@xcite r=,t = a , n = a .",
    "> from it turns out that the gravitomagnetic force only affects , in general , both the transverse and the normal components : @xmath16 . for polar orbital configurations , i.e. @xmath17 deg , @xmath18 , while for equatorial orbits , i.e. @xmath19 deg , @xmath20 . for nearly circular and equatorial orbits",
    "it turns out that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mean longitude .",
    "the four galilean satellitesgravity.html ] of jupiter are currently the best candidates ( among satellites evolving around giant planets ) in regard to their orbital motion s accuracy .",
    "indeed , ephemerides of the galilean satellites reach an accuracy of only few tens of kilometers for the modern period@xcite , and benefit of observations dispatched over more than a century ( from 1891 to 2003 in the case of l1 ephemerides ) .",
    "these observations have various origin . while most of them are photographic ones , the observation of mutual events ( the eclipse or occultation of one satellite by another ) delivers the most accurate earth - based observations of the galilean system . indeed ,",
    "such observations are photometric instead of astrometric , and so are less sensitive to atmosphere turbulence . hence , the accuracy of these latter can reach few tens of kilometers .",
    "more , jpl ephemerides accuracy amount to 5 km for the present period by the use of unpublished spacecraft observations ( see ref .   and http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sat@xmath23eph.html ) .      in regard to the lt effect ,",
    "for the jupiter s angular momentum we assume @xmath24 kg m@xmath25 s@xmath26 since the ratio for a hollow spherical shell and to @xmath27 for a homogenous sphere . ]",
    "@xmath28 of the moment of inertia @xmath29 to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mean equatorial radius , amounts to@xcite @xmath32 ( see also http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/jupiterfact.html ) .",
    "such estimates are based on theoretical models : at present , there are no direct , independent measurements of @xmath33 for jupiter .",
    "it should also be noted that lense and thirring in ref .   and",
    "soffel in ref .   overestimated the gravitomagnetic precessions of the galilean satellites because they modeled jupiter as a uniform sphere by assuming @xmath34 .    in order to compute the secular lt shifts @xmath35 on the jovian galilean moons it is important to consider that such a system is very complex because of the strong mutual perturbations of one satellite on another .",
    "in particular , the laplacian resonance@xcite n_1 - 3n_2 + 2n_3 = 0establishes a relation among the keplerian mean mean motions @xmath36 of io , europa and ganymede .",
    "this has consequences also on the lt effect .",
    "indeed , the gravitomagnetic force of is a small correction with respect to the newtonian monopole and , as usual in perturbation theory , it must be evaluated onto the unperturbed keplerian path for which the velocity entering is approximately @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the gravitomagnetic components of the equations of motion for io , europa and ganymede are not independent but they are coupled due to .",
    "more , secular variations of nodes and pericentres will affect the mean mean motions . to preserve the laplacian relation , variations on mean anomalies are also expected .",
    "hence , longitude evolutions of io , europa and ganymede have to be studied .",
    "this means that differences with respect to the case of independent motions , illustrated in table [ nores ] , are expected .",
    "this feature has been investigated numerically in the following way .      in order to numerically investigate the effect of the jovian gravitomagnetic field on the orbital motion of the four galilean satellites , we have performed several numerical integrations .",
    "the adopted software is called noe ( numerical orbital elaboration ) and is inspired from a former work presented in ref .  .",
    "it was developed at the royal observatory of belgium mainly for natural satellites ephemerides purpose .",
    "it is a n - body code which incorporates highly sensitive modeling and can generate partial derivatives .",
    "the latter ones are needed to fit the initial positions , velocities and other parameters to the observation data .",
    "we used the exact modeling , initial conditions and parameter values that were used during l1 ephemerides elaboration .",
    "let us recall that this model introduces the jovian gravity field by mean of @xmath38 coefficients , the satellites mutual perturbations ( including their respective oblateness coefficients @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) and the solar perturbation using de406 ephemerides . the selection ot these perturbations was done after a careful study of the magnitude expected from a large set of usually neglected perturbations ( planetary and satellites precessions , jovian @xmath41 coefficient ... ) , but did not considered lt effect at that time .",
    "a perturbation was added in the model only when found significant from the observations accuracy . in particular , secular variations inducing less than hundreds of kilometers after one century on the satellite longitudes",
    "have generally been considered negligible .",
    "indeed , these latter can be easilly absorbed by tiny changes on initial satellite positions and velocities . on the other hand ,",
    "small perturbations may be retained if damping enough known frequencies in the system or adding new ones .",
    "lt effect has been introduced by means of and . for an explicit formulation of all the equations used",
    ", we refer to ref .  .",
    "initial conditions and parameter values are available in ref .  .",
    "in particular , l1 ephemerides result from the fit of a high sensitive model to observations covering a time span from 1891 to 2003 .",
    "the integrator subroutine is the one of everhart@xcite , called ra15 .",
    "it was chosen for its speed and accuracy . during the integration a constant step size of @xmath42 day",
    "was used . to increase the numerical accuracy during the fit procedure ( see subsection [ sec : mes ] ) we performed integration over @xmath43 years instead of @xmath44 years .",
    "the numerical accuracy of our simulations is at the level of several meters .    in fig .",
    "( [ distnores ] ) we plot the differences on satellite distances between a numerical simulation including lt effect and a second simulation ( using the same set of initial conditions ) but neglecting lt effect .",
    "the adopted time span is 125 years and covers roughly the modern observation period . in a first step we followed our former analytical formulation and",
    "so neglected the mutual perturbations ( by nullifying the satellite masses ) . in particular , the laplacian resonance was not present in the system at this step .",
    "results are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "( [ distnores ] ) .",
    "as expected , the obtained secular shifts agree with the analytical calculations of table [ nores ] .    in a second step ,",
    "we reintroduced the satellite masses values ( and , thus , the laplacian resonance ) .",
    "results are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "( [ distnores ] ) .",
    "as it can be seen , the shifts remain unchanged for callisto at the level of 1.4 km .",
    "rather small change appear for ganymede with a slight decrease from 4.4 km to 4.2 km ; io and europa experience the most important changes passing from 28.6 km to 27 km and from 11.3 km to 16.3 km , respectively .",
    "these differences with our numerical estimations are induced by the laplacian resonance as explained in section [ sec : tpred ] .",
    "galilean satellite observations are rather different from those for the artificial satellites , in the sense that only the right ascension and declination for each natural satellite are available .",
    "neither estimation of the jupiter - satellite distances nor of satellite velocities are possible .",
    "hence , reconstruction of observed keplerian elements is not possible .",
    "moreover , the observations have a quite smaller coverage by satellite revolutions and are not dispatched equally over the years .",
    "this is why the method used to detect lt effects with lageos satellites can not be applied here . however , and to estimate the possible detection of lt effect among galilean system in a realistic way , we decided to apply a fit procedure of our numerical simulation neglecting lt effect on the simulation including lt effect ( acting like some real observations ) .",
    "the induced residuals can then be anticipated as part of the real observed residuals . if these former are found signicant ( at least one order of magnitude less ) , then one can deduce that the effect is detectable .",
    "this method was already applied successfully to estimate tidal effects among the galilean system in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we performed the fit procedure following ephemerides elaboration .",
    "as for l1 ephemerides , we fitted only the initial positions and velocities of each satellite .",
    "a sample of 628 daytimes with a 72.8 days time step was used .",
    "differences on cartesian positions for all satellites have been fitted , with no weights assigned .    in fig .",
    "( [ distres ] ) we show the residuals induced by lt effect after fit and which account in ephemerides residuals .",
    "it can be noted that a large part of the secular lt signature has been removed from the differential time series over 125 years to a level of several meters ( the level of accuracy of our simulations ) , while an interesting , long period pattern appears for europa with an amplitude of 20 meters .",
    "most of this variation appear on the inclination and the mean longitude ( graphs not shown here ) .    in table",
    "[ ipos ] the corrections delivered by our fit procedure and applied to the initial positions and velocities are given .",
    "table [ ikep ] presents the same corrections converted into keplerian elements . in the case of callisto",
    ", significant changes appear only on @xmath7 and @xmath8 with opposite numerical values .",
    "that is consistent with our analytical approach .",
    "for the three other satellites , significant variations appear both on @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath15 , which is a consequence of the laplacian resonance .",
