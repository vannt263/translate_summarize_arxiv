    "after the experimental discovery of graphene @xcite whose quasiparticles are described by a relativistic - like ( 2 + 1)-dimensional dirac equation with the velocity of light @xmath0 replaced by the fermi velocity @xmath1 , it was soon realized that this material is very promising for the experimental observation of the atomic collapse @xcite in the coulomb field of a point charge @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , the large value of the coupling constant @xmath3 leads to a dramatically smaller value of the critical charge @xmath4 [ ] compared to that in quantum electrodynamics where @xmath5 [ ] .",
    "since nuclei with such large charges do not exist in nature , this phenomenon was never observed in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the supercritical coulomb center instability is also closely related to the excitonic instability in graphene in the strong - coupling regime @xmath6 ( see refs .",
    "[ ] ) and the gap opening , which may transform graphene into an insulator @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the charged impurities are the dominant source of scatterers in graphene affecting its major electron transport features ( see , for example , ref . [ ] and references therein ) .",
    "recently , by creating artificial nuclei in a certain region of graphene fabricated through the deposition of charged calcium dimers on graphene with the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope , the supercritical regime was reached and the resonances corresponding to the atomic collapse states were observed @xcite . the supercritical instability for @xmath7 dimers on graphene was theoretically studied in ref . [ ] by making use of the density functional theory and an improved huckel model . in a recent publication , mao _",
    "et al_. proposed a more effective way to deposit a charge in graphene : they showed that a single - atom vacancy can host a local charge that can be gradually changed by applying the voltage pulses with the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope @xcite . similarly to the case of charged adatoms on graphene , a transition into a supercritical regime was observed with the formation of quasibound states at the vacancy site .",
    "in the continuum model , three of us extended @xcite the study of the supercritical instability of a single coulomb center in gapped graphene to the case of the simplest cluster of two equally charged impurities when the charges of impurities are subcritical , whereas their total charge exceeds a critical one .",
    "we determined the critical distance between the impurities separating the supercritical and subcritical regimes as a function of charges of impurities and a gap .",
    "an interesting problem of two oppositely charged impurities was considered in refs .  [ ] . obviously , this dipole problem is particle - hole symmetric and electron states are symmetric with respect to the change of the sign of energy , @xmath8 .",
    "naively , one would think that the supercritical regime in this problem sets in when the lowest - energy electron bound level intersects the highest energy hole bound state at @xmath9 .",
    "however , it was found @xcite that the levels first approach each other as the dipole moment increases , and then diverge .",
    "in fact , this behavior is typical for an avoided crossing @xcite of the states with the same symmetry .",
    "the issue of supercriticality was revisited by three of us in ref .",
    "we showed that a new type of supercritical behavior is realized in the dipole problem , which is connected with the change of localization of the highest - energy occupied state from the negatively charged impurity to the positively charged one .",
    "such a migration of the wave function corresponds to an electron and a hole spontaneously created from the vacuum in bound states and screening the positively and negatively charged impurities of the supercritical electric dipole , respectively .",
    "magnetic fields and their effects are ubiquitous in physics .",
    "electron states in a magnetic field are described by the infinitely degenerate landau levels . since all electron states of a given landau level have the same energy , magnetic field completely quenches the kinetic energy of these electrons making such systems ideally suitable for the realization of interaction - driven phases of matter .",
    "it is worth recalling here just two notable examples such as the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite and magnetic catalysis @xcite . in view of the above ,",
    "it is interesting how magnetic field affects the atomic collapse in graphene @xcite .",
    "the crucial ingredient is the existence of an infinitely degenerate zero - energy landau level for gapless dirac fermions in a magnetic field . in this case ,",
    "any small attractive potential leads to the appearance of negative - energy bound states , in contrast to the case without magnetic field when the impurity charge must exceed a certain critical value for the appearance of quasibound states .",
    "let us mention also that this result presents a quantum - mechanical single - particle counterpart of the magnetic catalysis in graphene .",
    "recently , electron states in the field of several charged impurities in graphene in a magnetic field were considered in ref .",
    "[ ] .    experimentally , electron states in the field of a coulomb impurity in a magnetic field were studied in refs .  [ ] , where it was shown that the strength of a charged impurity can be tuned by controlling the occupation of landau - level states with a gate voltage . at low landau level occupation ,",
    "the screening is so effective that the impurity becomes practically invisible , whereas at full occupancy the screening is weak and the impurity attains its maximum strength . in this regime ,",
    "the first experimental observation of landau - level splitting into discrete states due to lifting the orbital degeneracy was reported .",
    "this experiment provides a motivation for the present study where , in contrast to the earlier theoretical treatments @xcite , the main accent is made on the role of polarization effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section - model ] , we consider the electron levels in the coulomb field of a charged impurity in graphene in a magnetic field . how the screening of a charged impurity can be tuned by chemical potential is studied in sec .",

    "[ section - conclusion ] .",
    "let us consider the electron states in graphene with a single charged impurity in a magnetic field .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian in @xmath10 dimensions which describes the quasiparticle states in the vicinity of the @xmath11 points of graphene in the field of charged impurity in a magnetic field reads ( although , in view of the magnetic catalysis @xcite , a nonzero gap is always generated in graphene in a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite , this gap is rather small for realistic magnetic fields ; therefore , for simplicity , we neglect it in our analysis below ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the electron charge , the vector potential @xmath15 in the symmetric gauge describes magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of graphene , and @xmath16 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ general - hamiltonian ] ) acts on a two - component spinor @xmath17 which carries the valley ( @xmath18 and spin ( @xmath19 ) indices and we use the standard convention : @xmath20 , whereas @xmath21 , and @xmath22 refer to two sublattices of the hexagonal graphene lattice .",
    "we regularize the coulomb potential of an impurity by introducing a parameter @xmath23 of the order of the graphene lattice spacing .",
    "then the regularized interaction potential of the impurity with charge @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the dielectric constant .",
    "since the interaction potential ( [ impurity - potential ] ) does not depend on valley and spin , we will omit the valley and spin indices @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the wave functions below .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the magnetic length @xmath29 and the dimensionless quantity @xmath30 which characterizes the strength of the bare impurity .",
    "since the total angular momentum is conserved , we use the polar coordinates @xmath31 to write @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the orbital quantum number .",
    "then the dirac equation takes the form @xmath34 we solve numerically the above equations by using the shooting method . in order to utilize this method",
    ", one should determine the appropriate asymptote of the solution at @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "this asymptote is different for orbital numbers @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "for @xmath39 , by using @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and expressing one component in terms of the other , we find the following approximate equation : @xmath42 whose regular at the origin solution is @xmath43 .",
    "the other component @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the radial functions should satisfy the boundary conditions at the origin @xmath46 for @xmath47 , by using @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and proceeding in a similar way we find that the radial functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 satisfy the boundary conditions at the origin which are swapped with respect to those in the case @xmath37 , @xmath52    the numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ system - eq ] ) proceeds as follows .",
    "we take a `` shot '' from @xmath53 at a fixed value of energy solving the differential equations with the initial conditions ( [ initial - condition ] ) or  ( [ initial - condition2 ] ) and check the behavior of the wave functions at @xmath54 .",
    "the latter may tend to @xmath55 for some values of energy or to @xmath56 for other values .",
    "a physical solution is the solution for which the exponentially growing behavior of the absolute value is absent .",
    "we find the corresponding value of the energy of this solution by using the method of bisections . in our numerical calculations ,",
    "we use @xmath57 .",
    "the magnetic field modifies the energy spectrum of electrons in the coulomb field of the charged impurity making all continuum states discrete and provides an effective scale given by the magnetic length . on the other hand",
    ", the charged impurity removes the orbital degeneracy of landau levels transforming the latter into bandlike structures . in fig .",
    "[ compare ] we plot in solid lines the dimensionless energies @xmath58 of landau levels with @xmath59 and different @xmath60 as functions of impurity charge in the magnetic field @xmath61 .",
    "the blue solid curve describes the @xmath59 state of the @xmath62 landau level , and the red and green solid curves describe the @xmath59 level of the lower and upper `` quasicontinua '' , respectively , evolving with the charge of impurity . as the charge of impurity increases , the blue curve comes close to the red curve . in the absence of magnetic field , with further increase of the charge of impurity",
    "the corresponding bound state would dive into the lower continuum producing a resonance .     of electron levels in gapless graphene in the magnetic field @xmath63 t as functions of the impurity charge for different orbital numbers @xmath33 .",

    "according to fig .",
    "[ compare ] , the situation is _ qualitatively _ different in the presence of a magnetic field as the blue curve never crosses the red curve . instead ,",
    "typical level repulsions are realized ( the well - known avoided crossing theorem @xcite forbids a level crossing for two states with the same symmetry ) .",
    "it is seen that level repulsion occurs only between the sublevels with the same value of orbital momentum @xmath33 .",
    "for example , we clearly see the repulsion between the levels @xmath69 and @xmath70 , as well as the levels @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "states with different quantum numbers @xmath33 simply cross each other without repulsion .",

    "the electron density is weakly affected by the impurity and the radial distribution functions of the above mentioned states have one , two , and three maxima , respectively .",
    "as the impurity charge increases , all leftmost maxima in @xmath78 move to the impurity position @xmath53 and attain their maximal values at @xmath79 ( middle panel ) .",
    "in addition , a new maximum appears on the blue solid curve ( as well as additional maxima on the other two curves ) , and the radial distribution function of the @xmath62 level begins to look qualitatively like the radial distribution function of the @xmath65 level with two maxima .",

    "obviously , this is an analog of the phenomenon of the diving into continuum for a supercritical charge in the absence of a magnetic field . in the latter case , the lowest bound state dives into the lower continuum producing a resonance",
    "whose wave function can be considered as redistributed over the lower continuum states with energies of the order of the resonance width @xmath84 .",
    "all wave functions from this region have an additional sharp peak near the origin . as we see , when magnetic field is present , there is a similar redistribution of the profiles of radial distribution functions near the impurity ( note that as the impurity charge increases , the `` redistribution '' region shifts down to the lower landau levels ) . according to the right panel in fig .",
    "[ wf_mag ] , the blue curve representing the electron density is now similar to the red dashed curve in the left panel and the red dashed curve is similar to the green dot - dashed curve in the left panel .",
    "so far we did not take into account the screening of a charged impurity due the polarization effects in graphene to which we turn in the next section .",
    "the strength of the impurity , and consequently the splitting of landau levels , in the field of charged impurities can be effectively controlled by the gate voltage as was demonstrated in experiment in ref .",
    "luican - mayer _",
    "et al_. attribute the variation in the strength of the impurity potential to the screening properties of the 2d electron system . to describe this effect",
    "theoretically , we first consider the polarization function without the impact of the coulomb impurity . with the effects of screening taken into account , the poisson equation reads @xmath85 where the polarization function @xmath86 is calculated by using the wave functions in the absence of impurity .",
    "notice the presence of the pseudodifferential operator @xmath87 in the equation above , which is necessary to correctly describe the coulomb interaction in a dimensionally reduced electrodynamic system @xcite .    in order to show that the effective equation for planar charge density distribution has form ( [ poisson_eq ] ) , let us start with the coulomb potential in momentum space in three dimensions @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the planar momentum and @xmath90 the third component of momentum . to find the effective potential for a planar distribution of charges we should integrate over @xmath91 .",

    "in addition , a nonmonotonic momentum dependence of the static polarization function with a peak at @xmath114 leads to oscillations of the screened potential with the sign change as a function of distance . on the other hand ,",
    "if the chemical potential lies between landau levels , then the screening is minimal and the impurity can significantly affect the electron spectrum .",
    "these features of a charged impurity in graphene in the magnetic field are clearly observed in recent experiments @xcite .",
