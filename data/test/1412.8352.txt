    "the origin of flavor mixing is one of longstanding open questions in particle physics .",
    "firstly motivated by the well - known tri - bimaximal mixing  @xcite , a considerable effort has been devoted to understanding lepton mixing from a discrete flavor symmetry which is spontaneously broken down to two different residual subgroups in the neutrino and the charged lepton sectors",
    ". please see refs .",
    "@xcite for review of discrete flavor symmetries and their application in model building aspects .",
    "so far a complete classification of all possible lepton mixing which could be derived from a finite flavor symmetry group under the hypothesis of majorana neutrino has been accomplished  @xcite . among the complete list of mixing patterns",
    "achievable , only the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix with the second column being @xmath0 can be compatible with experimental data , and the dirac cp - violating phase is fixed to trivial .",
    "moreover , the majorana phases are indeterminate as the neutrino masses are unconstrained by flavor symmetry .    on the experimental side , the precise measurements of the reactor mixing angle @xmath1 by t2k  @xcite , minos  @xcite , double - chooz  @xcite ,",
    "reno  @xcite and daya - bay  @xcite reactor neutrino experiments is one of the most significant discoveries in recent years .",
    "the sizable @xmath2 opens the gateway to access two remaining unknown parameters in the neutrino sector : the neutrino mass hierarchy and the leptonic dirac cp phase @xmath3 . if neutrinos are majorana particles , there are two additional majorana cp phases which can play a critical role in the neutrinoless double beta decay , and we know nothing about their values so far .",
    "the t2k collaboration reported a weak evidence for nonzero @xmath4  @xcite , and some indications of nontrivial @xmath3 are starting to appear in global analysis of neutrino oscillation data  @xcite .",
    "needless to say , probing cp violation in the lepton sector would help deepen our understanding of the universe .",
    "some long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments such as lbne  @xcite , lbno  @xcite and hyper - kamiokande  @xcite have been proposed to precisely measure the lepton mixing parameters in particular the dirac cp phase @xmath3 .",
    "if the signal of cp violation is observed in future neutrino oscillation apparatuses , the paradigm of the flavor symmetry would be disfavored .",
    "moreover , in light of the hints for maximal dirac cp violation @xmath4 , it is imperative and significative to be able to understand the observed lepton mixing angles and meanwhile predict the values of cp phases from certain underlying principles .",
    "it is notable that cp symmetry was found to impose strong constraints on the fermion mass matrices nearly thirty years ago  @xcite .",
    "a typical simple cp transformation is the so - called @xmath5 reflection under which @xmath6 and @xmath7 transform into the cp - conjugate of each other  @xcite .",
    "a neutrino mass matrix fulfilling the @xmath5 reflection symmetry immediately gives rise to both maximal atmospheric mixing angle @xmath8 and maximal cp violation @xmath9 . in recent years",
    ", it is found that the @xmath5 reflection can naturally appear when cp symmetry is imposed together with the widely studied @xmath10 flavor symmetry  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , phenomenological models in which the desired breaking patterns of the flavor and cp symmetries are achieved dynamically have been constructed  @xcite .",
    "the interplay between cp symmetry with the flavor symmetries @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath12  @xcite has been investigated as well . when cp symmetry is combined with @xmath13  @xcite or @xmath14  @xcite flavor symmetry , cp transformations distinct from @xmath5 reflection",
    "can be produced such that @xmath3 can be non - maximal .",
    "it turns out that both mixing angles and cp phases depend on only one common free parameter in that case .",
    "recently the possible lepton mixing patterns derived from cp symmetry and the @xmath15 or @xmath16 flavor symmetry group series have been analyzed  @xcite , the experimentally preferred values of the mixing angles can be accommodated very well , and the corresponding phenomenological implications in neutrinoless double decay are discussed  @xcite . note that it is highly nontrivial to consistently define the cp symmetry in the context of a finite flavor symmetry  @xcite .",
    "there are more than one theoretical approachs dealing with flavor symmetry and cp violation  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we shall only concentrate on cp symmetry , and show that the lepton mixing matrix can be reconstructed from the remnant cp symmetry .",
    "we will derive the explicit form of the pmns matrix when one or two residual cp transformations are preserved .",
    "phenomenological implications for the lepton flavor mixing parameters are discussed in detail . compared with flavor symmetry paradigm , both mixing angles and cp phases",
    "can be predicted by remnant cp , and the observed value of the reactor mixing angles can be easily accommodated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : remnant_symmetry ] , remnant flavor symmetry and remnant cp transformations of the neutrino mass matrix are analyzed in the charged lepton diagonal basis . in section  [ sec : reconstruction_pmns ] , we show that the lepton mixing matrix can be reconstructed from the presumed remnant cp transformations . if two ( or one ) remnant cp transformations are preserved , the explicit form of the pmns matrix is derived , and it depends on one ( or three ) free real parameters in addition to the parameters of the remnant cp . in section  [ sec : phenomenology ] , the phenomenological predictions for the lepton mixing parameters are discussed , and we search for conditions of zero or maximal dirac cp violation . finally we summarize our results in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we shall clarify the remnant flavor symmetry and remnant cp symmetry of the lepton mass matrices .",
    "we shall assume throughout this paper that the neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "the lepton mass terms obtained after symmetry breaking are of the following form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the charge - conjugation matrix , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the three generation left and right - handed charged lepton fields respectively , and @xmath21 is the three left - handed neutrino fields .",
    "the majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath22 is symmetric .",
    "since the mixing matrix only relates to left - handed fermions in standard model , as usual we construct the hermitian mass matrix @xmath23 which connects left - handed charged leptons on both sides .",
    "we denote the unitary diagonalization matrix of @xmath24 and @xmath22 by @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , i.e. , @xmath27 where the light neutrino masses @xmath28 are real and non - negative .",
    "the lepton mixing matrix is the mismatch between neutrino and charged lepton diagonalization matrices , @xmath29 without loss of generality we shall choose to work in the basis where @xmath24 is diagonal",
    ". then @xmath25 would reduce to a unit matrix and the lepton mixing completely comes from the neutrino sector with @xmath30",
    ". the general form of @xmath22 is @xmath31 firstly let s determine the remnant flavor symmetries @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the neutrino and charged lepton mass terms .",
    "a unitary transformation @xmath34 of the left - handed majorana neutrino leads to the transformation of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is a flavor symmetry if and only if @xmath22 is invariant , i.e. , @xmath37 substituting the expression of @xmath22 in eq .   into this invariant condition and",
    "considering that the three light neutrino masses @xmath38 are non - degenerate  '' could be replaced with an arbitrary phase factor in eq .  .",
    "] , we obtain @xmath39 as an overall @xmath40 factor of @xmath36 is irrelevant , there are essentially four solutions for @xmath36 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 it is easy to see that @xmath43 is exactly a trivial identity matrix , and we can further check that @xmath44 hence the residual flavor symmetry of the neutrino mass matrix is @xmath45 klein group . on the other hand ,",
    "given the remnant klein symmetry in the neutrino sector and the associated 3-dimensional unitary representation matrices , one can straightforwardly construct the diagonalization matrix @xmath26 .",
    "similarly , the remnant flavor symmetry @xmath46 of the charged lepton mass matrix satisfies @xmath47 since @xmath24 is diagonal in the chosen basis and the three charged lepton masses are unequal , @xmath46 can only be a unitary diagonal matrix , i.e. , @xmath48 where @xmath49 are arbitrary real parameters .",
    "hence the charged lepton mass term generically admits a @xmath50 remnant flavor symmetry .",
    "conversely , if @xmath46 is diagonal with non - degenerate eigenvalues , @xmath24 would be forced to be real .",
    "the idea of residual symmetries @xmath36 and @xmath46 arising from some underlying discrete flavor symmetry group @xmath51 has been extensively explored , and many flavor models have been constructed  @xcite .    in the following , we shall investigate the remnant cp symmetry of the lepton mass terms .",
    "they do nt receive enough attention they deserve in the past .",
    "the cp transformation of the left - handed neutrino fields is defined via @xmath52 where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is a @xmath55 unitary matrices acting on generation space .",
    "@xmath54 is usually called generalized cp transformation in the literature  @xcite , since it is an identity matrix in conventional cp transformation .",
    "the lagrangian of the neutrino mass term in eq",
    ".   would be invariant if the neutrino mass matrix @xmath22 fulfills @xmath56 with the general form of @xmath22 in eq .",
    ", we obtain @xmath57 which yields @xmath58 therefore there are eight possibilities for @xmath54 . however , only four of them are relevant , and they can chosen to be @xmath59 the remaining four can be obtained from the above chosen ones by multiplying an over @xmath40 factor .",
    "note that we can not distinguish @xmath54 from @xmath60 since the minus sign can be absorbed by redefining the neutrino fields .",
    "moreover , we see that the remnant cp transformations @xmath61 are symmetric unitary matrices : @xmath62 otherwise the light neutrino masses would be degenerate . the same constraint that the remnant cp transformations in the neutrino sector should be symmetric is also obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in another way .",
    "it is remarkable that the remnant flavor symmetry can be induced by the remnant cp symmetry . from eq .",
    ", it is easy to obtain , @xmath63 this means that successively performing two cp transformations @xmath64 is equivalent to a flavor symmetry transformations .",
    "concretely we have the following relations : @xmath65 as a consequence , once we impose a set of generalized cp transformations onto the theory , there is always an accompanied flavor symmetry generated .",
    "furthermore , eq .   implies that any residual cp transformation can be expressed in terms of the remaining ones as follows , @xmath66 in other words , only three of the four remnant cp transformations are independent . in the same fashion ,",
    "the cp transformation of the charged lepton fields is @xmath67 for the symmetry to hold , the mass matrices @xmath68 has to satisfy @xmath69 in the chosen basis where @xmath68 is diagonal , @xmath70 can only be a diagonal phase matrix , i.e. , @xmath71 where @xmath72 are real .",
    "in short , the remnant cp symmetry can be constructed from the mixing matrix , and its explicit form can be determined more precisely with the improving measurement accuracy of the mixing angles and cp phases . before closing this section , we present the above discussed residual cp symmetry in an arbitrary basis : @xmath73 which can be derived in exactly the same way . in the end , we conclude that the remnant symmetries can be constructed from the mixing matrix which can be measured experimentally . in the following section , we shall demonstrate that the lepton mixing matrix can be constructed from the postulated remnant cp transformations .",
    "as has been shown in section  [ sec : remnant_symmetry ] , residual cp symmetries can be derived from mixing matrix , and vice versa lepton mixing matrix can be constructed from the remnant cp symmetries in the neutrino and the charged lepton sectors . in concrete models , we can start from a set of cp transformations @xmath74 which the lagrange respects at high energy scale .",
    "subsequently @xmath74 is spontaneously broken by some scalar fields into different remnant symmetries in the neutrino and the charged lepton sectors .",
    "the misalignment between the two remnant symmetries is responsible for the mismatch of the rotations which diagonalize the neutrino and charged lepton matrices , and accordingly the pmns matrix is generated .",
    "the remnant cp symmetries would be assumed hereinafter and we shall not consider how the required vacuum compatible with the remnant symmetries is dynamically achieved , since the resulting lepton mixing pattern is independent of vacuum alignment mechanism and there are generally more than one methods realizing the desired symmetry breaking in practical model building .    as before we still stick to the charged lepton diagonal basis in the following .",
    "if four cp transformations @xmath75 out of @xmath76 are conserved by the neutrino mass matrix , where the subscript `` @xmath77 '' denotes remnant . in order to be well - defined ,",
    "@xmath78 should be unitary matrices and satisfy : @xmath79 for @xmath80 . as shown in eq .",
    ", a @xmath81 remnant flavor symmetry is generated with element of the form @xmath82 .",
    "it is well - known that the lepton mixing matrix ( except the majorana phases ) is fixed by the residual klein group up to independent permutations of rows and columns .",
    "if the residual flavor symmetry originates from a finite flavor symmetry group at high energy , a complete classification of all possible pmns matrix has been worked out  @xcite .",
    "an added bonus here is that the majorana cp phases can also be determined from the postulated remnant cp transformations although they are not constrained by the remnant flavor symmetry at all .",
    "if three cp transformations are preserved by the neutrino mass terms , the fourth one can be generated in the way shown in eq .  .",
    "hence there are still four residual cp transformations . given the explicit forms of remnant cp",
    ", the lepton mixing matrix can be straightforwardly calculated .    in the following",
    ", we shall investigate the most interesting case in which the neutrino mass matrix is invariant under the action of two residual cp transformations @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "in concrete models , this situation can be realized in two different ways : only @xmath83 and @xmath84 belong to the beginning cp transformations @xmath74 or @xmath74 contains all the four remnant cp transformations , but two of them are broken at low energy .",
    "to avoid degenerate light neutrino masses , both @xmath83 and @xmath84 should be symmetric unitary matrices .",
    "furthermore , a residual @xmath85 flavor symmetry is induced with the generator @xmath86 .",
    "it is easy to check that the following consistency equations are fulfilled , @xmath87 as we have @xmath88 , the neutrino mass matrix would be invariant under @xmath84 if it is invariant under both cp transformation @xmath83 and flavor transformation @xmath89 . as a consequence , from now on we shall focus on the residual symmetry @xmath83 and @xmath89 for convenience .",
    "firstly we note that only one column of the diagonalization matrix @xmath26 , which coincides with @xmath90 in the working basis , is fixed by the single @xmath85 residual flavor symmetry @xmath89 .",
    "this column is exactly the unique eigenvector of @xmath89 with eigenvalue @xmath91 if @xmath92  @xcite . using the freedom of redefining the charged lepton fields ( or changing the basis further but keeping @xmath24 still diagonal ) , each element of this column can always set to be real and non - negative .",
    "hence the column dictated by @xmath89 can be parameterized as @xmath93 where both @xmath94 and @xmath95 are real parameters in the interval of @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "consequently @xmath89 is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 denote a three dimensional unit matrix . given ( postulated ) the column vector @xmath99 , the remaining two columns of the pmns matrix can be obtained from any orthonormal pair of basis vectors @xmath100 and @xmath101 in the plane orthogonal to @xmath99 by a unitary rotation . here",
    "we choose @xmath102 moreover , since the remnant symmetry can not predict the ordering of the light neutrino mass eigenvalues , the three column vectors of @xmath90 can be permuted in any way you want before comparison with experimental data .",
    "therefore the pmns matrix is of the form : @xmath103 where @xmath104 represents any @xmath55 permutation matrix , and @xmath105 is the unitary rotation matrix @xmath106 where the rotation angle @xmath107 and phases @xmath108 are free real parameters .",
    "the values of @xmath108 would be further constrained by the remnant cp transformation @xmath83 .    from eq .  , we see that the residual flavor transformation @xmath109 could be chosen to be real @xmath110 without loss of generality .",
    "then the consistency equation of eq .",
    "implies that @xmath111 .",
    "hence @xmath112 is a simultaneous eigenvector of @xmath89 and @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , given an eigenvector @xmath113 of a symmetric unitary matrix , it is easy to shown that the complex conjugate @xmath114 is also an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue . as a result",
    ", one can always take the eigenvectors of a symmetric unitary matrix to be real .",
    "therefore the remaining two eigenvectors of @xmath83 denoted by @xmath115 and @xmath116 could be real .",
    "they are mutually orthogonal and both orthogonal to @xmath112 .",
    "accordingly @xmath117 can be written as follows , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a real parameter .",
    "the remnant cp transformation @xmath83 can be constructed from its eigenvectors @xmath120 via @xmath121 where @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the eigenvalues of @xmath83 .",
    "note that the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix must be complex numbers with modulus one .",
    "then another cp transformation @xmath84 is @xmath125 we see that @xmath99 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are also the eigenvectors of @xmath84 while the corresponding eigenvalues become @xmath122 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively .",
    "now we turn to explore the constraint of the remnant cp transformation @xmath83 .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix @xmath22 invariant under the action of @xmath83 should fulfill @xmath128 which leads to @xmath129 as shown in eq .  , where @xmath130 . inserting the expressions of @xmath83 in eq .   and",
    "@xmath90 in eq .",
    ", we obtain @xmath131 where we have defined @xmath132 further premultiplying @xmath133 and post - multiplying @xmath134 on both sides of eq .",
    ", we have @xmath135 we can see that the left side of this equation is equal to the complex conjugate of the right side .",
    "notice that @xmath136 is a block diagonal matrix and @xmath137 is diagonal matrix .",
    "this equation is satisfied if and only if the combination @xmath138 is a block diagonal real orthogonal matrix , i.e. , @xmath139 where each entry of @xmath140 is determined up to a possible minus sign which can always be absorbed into the free parameter @xmath107 and @xmath141 . then we have @xmath142 therefore if the neutrino mass term has two remnant cp transformations @xmath83 and @xmath84 given by eqs.([eq : xr1],[eq : xr2 ] ) in the charged lepton diagonal basis , then lepton mixing matrix would be constrained to be of the form @xmath143 note that the remnant cp transformations @xmath144 depend on six real parameters @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath119 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , as show in eqs.([eq : xr1],[eq : xr2 ] ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath148 are the arguments of the eigenvalues of @xmath144 up to @xmath149 while the eigenvectors are expressed in terms of @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath119 . in this approach , @xmath144 can take any values you want , and accordingly @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath119 and @xmath148 are free input parameters .",
    "it is remarkable that the resulting pmns matrix is independent of how the remnant cp @xmath144 is dynamically realized . once the values of @xmath144 ( the values of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath119 and @xmath148 ) are known ( postulated ) ,",
    "the pmns matrix compatible with @xmath144 would follow immediately from eq .  , and it only depends on one free parameter @xmath107 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath150 is a diagonal matrix with entries @xmath151 or @xmath152 .",
    "its effect is only shifting the majorana phases by @xmath149 .",
    "the permutation matrix @xmath104 can take six different values .",
    "however , exchanging the second and the third columns is equivalent to the redefinitions @xmath153 and @xmath154",
    ". hence there are only three inequivalent permutations of the columns . in other words",
    ", the fixed vector @xmath155 can be the first column , second column of the third column of the pmns matrix .",
    "the phenomenological predictions of the three cases will be discussed in section  [ sec : phenomenology ] .",
    "now we consider the last case in which only one remnant cp transformation @xmath156 is preserved by the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "similar to previous cases discussed , @xmath156 should be a symmetric unitary matrix . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath156 can be parameterized as @xmath157 where @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the eigenvalues of @xmath156 , @xmath99 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 given by eqs.([eq : v1],[eq : v23 ] ) represent its eigenvectors , and they form a set of most general three - dimensional real orthogonal vectors .",
    "the invariance of the neutrino mass matrix under @xmath156 leads to the constraint : @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath26 denotes the diagonalization matrix of @xmath22 with @xmath160 .",
    "this condition can be further simplified into @xmath161 where @xmath162 .",
    "premultiplying @xmath133 and post - multiplying @xmath163 on both sides of eq .",
    ", we obtain @xmath164 therefore the combination @xmath165 is a generic real orthogonal matrix , and it can be expressed as , @xmath166 with @xmath167 where @xmath168 are real parameters , and a possible overall minus sign of @xmath169 is dropped since it is insignificant .",
    "hence we conclude that the pmns matrix , which coincides with @xmath26 in our working basis , is of the form @xmath170 comparing with scenario with two residual cp transformations , we still need six input parameters @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath119 and @xmath148 to specify the explicit form of the assumed cp transformation , and the resulting lepton mixing matrix @xmath90 depends on three free parameters @xmath168 instead of one .",
