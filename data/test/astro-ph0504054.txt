    "the standard model for nova outbursts is a thermonuclear runaway in an accreted hydrogen envelope on the surface of a white dwarf . on time scales of days prior to the runaway , the flow in the partially degenerate hydrogen rich envelope is convectively unstable .",
    "the convective instability is driven by nuclear burning that is highly sensitive both to the temperature and to the chemical abundances .",
    "the details of the abundance mixing within and at the edge of the convective zone and the fate of temperature fluctuations are therefore crucial elements of the runaway mechanism . in order to capture these effects , several multidimensional simulations of nova outbursts",
    "have been performed ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) .    in this study",
    "we attempt to validate multi dimensional schemes by discriminating numerical effects from physical ones in the explosion phase .",
    "one problem is to identify proper initial conditions for the simulations .",
    "since the pre - runaway quasi - hydrostatic accretion time is orders of magnitude longer than the runaway time , all of the published multi dimensional nova calculations start from a spherically symmetric 1d model , mapped to 2d ( or 3d ) .",
    "the computed measurable variables are sensitive to the adaptation of the 1d initial model to the multidimensional model , a problem that was discussed by ( @xcite ) .",
    "another problem is the implementation of a correct outer boundary condition . @xcite",
    "discuss the sensitivity of 1d lagrangian models to the outer boundary conditions during the expansion phase .",
    "they claim that fine zones are needed in order to resolve the details of the expansion of the nova atmosphere from white dwarf dimensions to red giant dimensions .    two independent studies - those of ( @xcite , @xcite ) and ( @xcite ; @xcite ) - used the same 1d initial models but were led to different conclusions about the strength of the runaway and its ability to reproduce a fast nova .",
    "in order to identify the reasons for these differences , we carefully analyzed the sensitivities mentioned above .",
    "we argue here that the early stages of the flash phase , for which the evolution is still almost quasi - static , are highly sensitive to the outer boundary conditions .",
    "the sensitivity addressed in this study takes place during the explosion ( flash ) phase and the main issue is the difference between multi - dimensional numerical schemes ( lagrangian vs. eulerian ) , which has no 1d counterpart .",
    "the sensitivity is certainly not a problem of resolution ( see next section ) . in the explosion ( flash ) ,",
    "phase the issue of resolution is important mainly in the mixing layers , but not outside at the atmosphere . in this phase ,",
    "as the flash develops , the radial dimension of the envelope can increase by a factor of three ( fig.3 ) , affecting the pressure at the bottom of the accreted envelope where burning takes place .",
    "the question of proper boundary conditions for multi dimensional simulations during this phase is therefore , the main topic addressed in this work .",
    "we show that different , commonly used , mass outflow conditions at the outer boundary can make the difference between a successful runaway model and a model for which the runaway is artificially quenched .",
    "we analyze the cause for this failure and conclude with a recommendation for boundary conditions that are consistent with the physics of the problem .",
    "our initial 1d model is a 1.14 co wd that has accreted a @xmath1 envelope ( solar abundance ) up to the stage at which a tnr develops .",
    "the model is composed of 130 co core zones and 50 accreted hydrogen zones . in 1d ,",
    "the main features of the runaway , such as the accreted mass up to the runaway , the peak temperature and the peak energy generation rate , are converged at that spatial resolution . increasing the number of zones in the accreted hydrogen layer to 250 change those values by a fraction of a percent .    when the temperature at the base of the envelope has reached @xmath2 k ( just before the 1d runaway starts ) , the outer @xmath3 of the star is mapped , without any change in the zoning , as a multidimensional model ( 2d or 3d ) onto the multidimensional hydro solver .",
    "the evolution in 2d is followed without any initial perturbation .",
    "the 1d code and the 2d code use the same difference scheme for the momentum equation , the same radial zoning and the same eos .",
    "therefore , after the initial mapping the envelope is almost everywhere in full hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium at local points are less then one part in ten thousand . for models at earlier stages in the runaway where the envelope is still stable against convection , the 2d mapped model stays in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium for a hundred seconds ( the typical time step , dictated by the sound crossing time is about @xmath4 seconds ) . in this way we avoid the problems of mapping the 1d models to multi dimensional models , a problem that is thoroughly discussed by ( @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical scheme of the 1d model is a lagrangian scheme for which mass at the outer boundary is conserved and there is no overshoot mixing between the core matter and the accreted envelope .",
    "the multidimensional models try to analyze closely the details of the convective flow and are therefore basically eulerian . because of the extreme effect that overshoot mixing at the inner interface has on the nuclear burning in 2d it is impossible to judge the accuracy of the 2d model by the 1d results .",
    "the models presented here are all 2d models .",
    "the 2d hydro vulcan solver ( @xcite consists of two computational stages within one time step . as a first stage a purely lagrangian hydro time step is performed ( explicit in our case ) . in the second stage , a high - order explicit remapping is performed . in this remapping stage",
    "one can remap the new flow field onto any desired grid ; the original eulerian grid , or any other adaptive grid .",
    "the scheme as a whole is therefore called hereafter arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ( ale ) .",
    "the lateral boundary conditions at the sides of the multidimensional slice can be either fixed or periodic with only a slight effect on the solution .",
    "the computational slice includes a significant part of the static , inert , white dwarf core .",
    "the deep cold part of the core justifies a fixed inner boundary condition .",
    "we assumed initially that , since the computational slice covers a few pressure scale heights , there will not be any sensitivity to the exact outer boundary condition .",
    "subsequently , we determined that this assumption is quite unjustified .",
    "it is well known that the runaway is a threshold phenomena , the pressure at the base of the envelope must be in excess of a certain value of a few time @xmath5 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "spurious mass loss from the computational grid at the outer boundary slightly decreases the pressure at the bottom of the burning zone . in the worst case",
    ", this mass loss totally quenches the runaway while in other cases it leads to a very fast non - physical turnoff of the runaway .",
    "since the physical mechanism for the turnoff is the decrease in pressure due to expansion , it is clear that a correct boundary condition is essential . in order to demonstrate the problem and its solution , we present here the results",
    "we have obtained for four different schemes for the outer boundary condition that were tested :    * eulerian scheme with free outflow at the outer boundary ( eulerian - open in fig .",
    "1 ) : for this scheme , matter with positive radial velocity in the outer zone is lost from the computational grid at each step . * eulerian scheme with modified mass flux outer boundary condition ( eulerian inflow+outflow in fig .",
    "1 ) : this scheme derives from the observation that during the development of the runaway the outer boundary is convective .",
    "it follows that at any time some of the outer grid points have velocities directed outward and some have incoming velocities .",
    "therefore , as long as the evolution is quasi - static , the amount of mass that leaves the last original zone should flow back onto the grid once the convective turnover of this convection cell is completed .",
    "based on this assumption , we added a modified mass flux outer boundary condition .",
    "for this scheme , whenever the velocities in the outer zones point outward , the mass flux is calculated and mass is lost .",
    "when the velocities point inward , however , we impose an incoming mass flux with the assumption that the outer zone is also the donor .",
    "this method is in a way equivalent to models working with `` ghost cells '' for extrapolation of the mass fluxes in the case of `` open boundaries '' . * eulerian scheme with no mass flux ( fixed ) outer boundary condition ( eulerian fix - closed in fig .",
    "1 ) : for this option , matter is forced to stay within the grid ( no mass flux is allowed to pass into or out of the outer edge of the grid ) .",
    "mass that is artificially accumulated near the outer boundary produces extra outer pressure .",
    "this extra pressure is only an artifact of the numerical model . *",
    "an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ( ale ) scheme for which the radius of the outer zone is defined in a way that conserves mass ( lagrangian in fig .",
    "this scheme enables us to overcome three major obstacles that the nova models face : a ) the lagrangian hydro step takes care of the dimensional expansion of the computed regime .",
    "b ) the remap stage enables us to keep a radial grid all the time .",
    "the radial grid has @xmath6 zones .",
    "the number of radial zones is fixed and they are numbered by the index @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the transversal zones are numbered by the index j , @xmath9 .",
    "all the transversal zones ( @xmath9 ) for each k are defined to be the k - th shell .",
    "c ) the arbitrariness of the eulerian grid enables us to model the burning zones at the bottom of the hydrogen rich envelope with very delicate zones in spite of the dimensional expansion due to the runaway . + in order to realize these goals at each time step , a `` radial '' mass conserving grid is defined ( after the lagrangian part of the step ) in the following way . for each k shell of grid cells that started the step with the same radius a new radius",
    "is defined so that the mass of that shell is conserved . in the new grid , defined for the next step ,",
    "the lateral boundaries of each grid cell are kept fixed ( @xmath10 lateral equal zones ) .",
    "the radial coordinate of the whole k - th shell of grid cells is defined by interpolation between the initial eulerian radial grid and the new mass conserving grid .",
    "the only restriction is that , at the outer parts of the grid , the @xmath6 shell will follow the new mass conserving grid so that the total mass is conserved .",
    "since we usually want to keep the fine zoning in the inner parts of the grid where intense burning and mixing takes place ( item ( c ) above ) , the new grid smoothly interpolates between the initial eulerian grid in the inner zones and the `` lagrangian '' grid at the outer zones . in this way the outer boundary is expanding with time .",
    "the interpolation we use is of the following form : + @xmath11 + where : * * @xmath7 is the index of the radial k - th shell . *",
    "* @xmath12 is the radius of the k - th shell in the mass conserving lagrangian grid . *",
    "* @xmath13 is the original radius of the k - th shell in the initial eulerian grid * * @xmath14 is a power low .",
    "the default value we use is @xmath15 .    in order to avoid small differences that might appear during the initial stages , ( just after the mapping of the 1d model into 2d ) , all four models started from a single 2d profile of the ale scheme 20 seconds after it was mapped into 2d .",
    "the convective cells are already fully developed at this stage .    with the present resolution",
    ", it is difficult to obtain any significant information on the light curve .",
    "the results concerning the strength of the outburst are therefore judged only by comparison with 1d spherically symmetric models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this respect",
    ", we define a successful nova to be a tnr for which the amount of thermonuclear energy pumped into the envelope on a dynamic time scale is comparable to the binding energy of the envelope . for the case",
    "we have considered of a 1.14 wd with an accreted envelope mass of @xmath16 , the binding energy of the envelope is approximately @xmath17 erg .",
    "the criterion we therefore adopt for a successful nova is an overall reaction rate greater then @xmath18 erg / sec for more then 50 seconds ( typical dynamical time of the accreted envelope ) .",
    "we examine the sensitivity of the 2d evolution of the models by comparing the following measurable quantities ;    * the time history of the overall energy production rate ( fig .",
    "1 ) . * the time history of the pressure at the base of the computational slice ( fig .",
    "the ale scheme is expected to be the most accurate .",
    "indeed , for this scheme the energy production rate increases continuously and a runaway is taking place .",
    "the characteristics of this model throughout its evolution is compatible with the 1d evolution of co enriched models .",
    "we have therefore chosen to compare all other models to this model .",
    "the free eulerian - open scheme gives a significantly different result : essentially no runaway .",
    "although the initial pressure at the outer zone is two orders of magnitude less than the pressure at the bottom zone , the small decrease in pressure on a few dynamic times ( the flow is extremely sub - sonic ) quenches the runaway .",
    "the differences in the pressure profiles are evident in fig.2 . in fig.3",
    "we demonstrate the major difference between the two schemes .",
    "the figure shows a color map of the logarithm of the energy production rate within the envelope close to the maximum of energy production ( time=100 sec , see fig .",
    "1 ) in both models . for the ale",
    "lagrangian mass conserving scheme we see the high energy production rates at the bottom , reaching values of @xmath19 erg / gr / sec . for the pure eulerian scheme the rates are below @xmath20 erg / gr / sec .",
    "the differences in the geometric dimensions of the envelope in both models is clear , once observed it confirms the necessity of the lagrangian approach .",
    "the modified eulerian scheme conserves mass for a while , as long as the matter is convecting in the absence of overall expansion . once the runaway starts to take place ( at about @xmath21 seconds ) , however , the net expansion velocities in the outer regions are higher than any component of the convective flow at this zone .",
    "subsequently , mass loss quenches the runaway ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    the eulerian - closed scheme agrees quite well with the ale scheme until the point at which pressure starts to drop in the lagrangian scheme ( @xmath22 seconds in fig .",
    "2 ) . the agreement is both from the point of view of energy production rates ( fig . 1 ) and of the topology of the convective cells .",
    "once we prevent the expansion of matter at the outer boundary , however , it flows back and artificially enhances the convective velocities and the mixing ( fig .",
    "this scheme thus extends the runaway artificially so that in the absence of expansion there will be no turnoff of the tnr .",
    "the onset of the thermonuclear runaway in nova outbursts occurs once the accreted envelope reaches a critical pressure .",
    "a detailed knowledge of the evolution of the pressure at the base of the envelope is therefore essential to our understanding of the development of the runaway .",
    "the numerical simulations presented in this paper show the major role which the outer boundary conditions play in the evolution of the outburst . of the four schemes we examine in this paper , only the ale scheme provides a correct physical solution to the problem . the free outflow ( open )",
    "boundary condition used in eulerian schemes artificially quenches the runaway .",
    "use of such a boundary condition in eulerian simulations can explain the main differences between the models presented by @xcite and those of @xcite .",
    "the fact that in the latter simulation virtually all of the hydrogen disappears from the grid at late times ( fig.8 in @xcite ) supports this assumption ( fig.3 ) .",
    "for the same reason , the modified boundary condition we have described fails to reproduce the physical features of nova outbursts during the expansion phase .",
    "it can serve properly to represent the boundary conditions only in the case of a quasi static convective envelope .",
    "a possible remedy to this problem could be an addition of empty grid cells at the outer part of the computed region ( `` ghost cells '' ) .",
    "the amount of expansion demonstrated in fig.3 shows that this solution is not appropriate for the problem presented here .    to conclude",
    ", we state that proper multi dimensional simulations of novae - like explosions should maintain the lagrangian nature of the expanding envelope .",
    "the sensitivity we encountered is expected whenever the onset of a runaway is critically dependent upon the evolution of the pressure in a subsonic regime .",
