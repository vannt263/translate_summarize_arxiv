    "towards observing gravitational waves , several gravitational wave interferometers on earth are steadily developing today , such as the laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) @xcite , tama300 @xcite , geo600",
    "@xcite , and virgo @xcite . thus it will be possible for us to detect gravitational waves directly in the near future .",
    "it is believed that mergers of binary neutron - star - neutron - star ( ns - ns ) , neutron - star - black - hole ( ns - bh ) , and bh - bh , or supernovae , and so on , can become strong sources of gravitational waves .",
    "after these violent events occur , compact objects may be left and may be turbulent .",
    "then gravitational waves are emitted from them . at this time , these gravitational waves convey information on the source object . if these gravitational waves are directly detected on earth , it is possible to obtain some information about the sources .",
    "this research field is called `` gravitational wave astronomy . '' in this field , there is an attempt to obtain information about properties of the equation of state ( eos ) of high density matter .",
    "this is one of the most important purposes of gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "gravitational waves are emitted by the nonspherical oscillation of compact objects .",
    "the oscillations are damped out as gravitational waves carry away the oscillational energy .",
    "such oscillations are called quasinormal modes ( qnms ) .",
    "the qnms have complex frequencies whose real and imaginary parts correspond to the oscillational frequency and damping rate , respectively .",
    "the qnms fall into two types from their nature .",
    "one involves fluid modes which are connected with the stellar matter .",
    "the other involves spacetime modes which are the oscillations of spacetime metric .",
    "moreover , the fluid modes are classified into various types .",
    "the well - known modes are the @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 modes @xcite .",
    "the fluid modes have a characteristic that the damping rate im(@xmath6 ) is much smaller than the oscillational frequency re(@xmath6 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 mode is the fundamental mode .",
    "there exists only one @xmath0 mode for each index @xmath7 of spherical harmonics @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath4 mode is the pressure or acoustic mode , whose restoring force is caused by the pressure gradient inside the star .",
    "the @xmath5 mode is the gravity mode , which arises from buoyancy in a gravity field .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 modes are spacetime modes @xcite . unlike the fluid modes , the damping rate of the @xmath9 and @xmath1 modes is comparable to or larger than the oscillational frequency .    for the qnms of neutron stars , so far many authors have argued the possibilities for determining the eos in the high density region and/or for restricting the properties of neutron stars , such as the radius @xmath11 or mass @xmath12 , by employing the observed gravitational wave of several nonradial modes @xcite . as a candidate for a star which is smaller than neutron stars , the possibility of a quark star or a compact star , which is supported by degenerate pressure of quark matter , has been pointed out",
    ". such a quark star has been investigated by many authors ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) . in their view , it is commonly assumed that such quark stars contain quark matter in the core region and are surrounded by hadronic matter , although they are in the branch of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "witten @xcite suggested another type of quark star .",
    "if the true ground state of hadrons is bulk quark matter , which consists of approximately equal numbers of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath3 quarks ( `` strange matter '' ) , there exist self - bound quark stars .",
    "they are called `` strange stars . '' in this case , their mass and radius are smaller than those of typical neutron stars , which are @xmath15 10 km and @xmath16 , respectively . because we do not have reliable information about the equilibrium properties of hadronic and quark matters at high densities ,",
    "it is not clear what kinds of quark stars are realized .",
    "recently , drake @xmath17 @xmath18 . reported that the deep chandra letg+hrc - s observations of the soft x - ray source rx j1856.53754 reveal an x - ray spectrum quite close to that of a blackbody of temperature @xmath19 ev @xcite .",
    "the data contain evidence for the lack of spectral features or pulsation @xcite .",
    "drake @xmath17 @xmath18 . also reported that the interstellar medium neutral hydrogen column density is @xmath20@xmath21 @xmath22 . with the results of recent hst parallax analyses , that yields an estimate of 111170 pc for distance @xmath23 to rx j1856.5 - 3754 .",
    "combining this range of @xmath23 with the blackbody fit leads to a radiation radius of @xmath248.2 km . that is smaller than typical neutron star radii @xcite .",
    "thus they suggested that the x - ray source may be a quark star .    in the meanwhile , in ref .",
    "@xcite , walter and lattimer claimed that the blackbody model adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite could not explain the observed uv - optical spectrum .",
    "they undertook to fit the two - temperature blackbody and heavy - element atmosphere models which were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in x - ray and uv - optical wavelengths . from their analyses they found that the radiation radius was 1226 km and was consistent with that of a neutron star .",
    "however , this model can not explain the lack of spectral features .",
    "in addition , recently braje and romani also suggested a two - temperature blackbody model , which can reproduce both the x - ray and optical - uv spectral @xcite . although their model is inconsistent with the fact that pulsation is not detected , this might be explained by the object being a young normal pulsar and its nonthermal radio beam missing the earth s line of sight .",
    "however , they can not also answer why there are no features in the observed x - ray spectrum . in ref .",
    "@xcite , burwitz @xmath17 @xmath18 . discussed the possibility of a condensate surface which is made of unknown material to explain both the uv - optical and x - ray spectra in a neutron star .",
    "more recently , some groups discussed the possibility that the effects of a strong magnetic field ( @xmath25 ) @xcite or rapid rotation ( @xmath26 ) @xcite may smear out any spectral features . in these situations , however , it seems that there are no reliable models that account for all the observational facts .",
    "it is still controversial whether rxj1856.5 - 3754 is a normal neutron star or some other compact star like a quark star .",
    "here we adopt the simplest picture , which is used by drake @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite : the uniform temperature blackbody model .    as for gravitational waves emitted from quark stars , yip , chu , and",
    "leung studied nonradial stellar oscillation for stars whose radius is around 10 km  @xcite .",
    "kojima and sakata demonstrated the possibility of distinguishing quark stars from neutron stars by using both the oscillational frequency and the damping rate of the @xmath0 mode  @xcite .",
    "sotani and harada showed that the @xmath0 and lowest @xmath1 modes depend strongly on the eos of quark matter and the properties of quark stars , where the lowest @xmath1 mode is the one which has the largest frequency among all @xmath1 modes  @xcite .",
    "then they pointed out the possibility of determining the eos and/or the stellar properties .",
    "furthermore , they also studied @xmath9 modes in detail .",
    "however , they clearly showed that @xmath9 modes do not depend much on the eos of quark matter and are not important for constraining the model parameters from observations . in their work , however , they assumed that the star is a pure quark star and that the eos is described by a simple bag model which has only one parameter : i.e. , the bag constant @xmath2 . in general , there are a variety of parameters even within bag models : e.g. , the bag constant @xmath2 , the strange quark mass @xmath27 , the fine structure constant in qcd @xmath28 , and so on . in particular ,",
    "if the effects of nonvanishing strange quark mass @xmath29 are taken into account , the structure of quark stars can be affected considerably ( for recent analyses , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in this situation , we compute the qnms in the bag model used in ref .",
    "citekohri:2002hf and investigate the possibility of restricting the model parameters by the observations of qnms . in this study , we deal with only @xmath0 and the lowest @xmath1 modes in response to the results in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "effective theories of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , such as bag models , perturbation theories , or finite - temperature lattice data , are difficult to test by experiments , especially in a low temperature and high density regime . to further study them and fit their model parameters , we should compare the theoretical predictions in such models with experimental data  e.g .",
    ", data in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments and so on .",
    "thus , in this situation information about compact objects obtained by astrophysical observations is indispensably valuable , being independent of the above - mentioned ground - based experiments in nuclear physics or particle physics . among the astrophysical observations ,",
    "the observation of gravitational waves emitted from oscillating compact objects is quite unique because gravitational waves directly convey information on the internal structure of compact objects , where the density would reach the nuclear density .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quarkstar ] we introduce the basic equation including the eos to construct quark stars as the source of gravitational waves and to give the properties of quark star structure . we present a method of determining the qnms for the case of spherically symmetric stars in sec .",

    "[ sec : result ] we show the numerical results for the qnms for the quark star constructed in sec . [ sec : quarkstar ] . in this section",
    "we present the dependence of the qnms on the parameters of the eos and stellar properties , and discuss the possibility of determining the eos of quark matter .",
    "we conclude this paper in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we adopt units of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 denote the speed of light , reduced planck s constant , and gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature of @xmath34 throughout this paper .",
    "we assume that the quark star is static and spherically symmetric . in this case",
    "the metric is described by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are metric functions of @xmath38 and @xmath37 is related to the mass function @xmath39 as @xmath40 the mass function @xmath39 is the gravitational mass inside a surface of radius @xmath38 and satisfies @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the energy density .",
    "the equilibrium stellar model is constructed by solving the equations @xmath43 equation ( [ dpdr ] ) is the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above equations we need an eos to compute the star configuration . the stellar surface @xmath44 is the position where the pressure vanishes , and the stellar mass @xmath12 is defined as @xmath45 . because the metric in the exterior of the star is the schwarzschild one , the metric ( [ metric_star ] ) must be connected smoothly with the schwarzschild one at the stellar surface .",
    "next we describe the eos in bag models . to construct stars composed of zero - temperature @xmath46 quark matter , we start with the thermodynamic potentials @xmath47 for a homogeneous gas of @xmath48 quarks ( @xmath49 ) of rest mass @xmath50 up to first order in the qcd coupling constant @xmath28 .",

    "the conditions for equilibrium with respect to the weak interaction and for overall charge neutrality are required .",

    "these boundary conditions are given as follows : ( i ) the eigenfunctions are regular at the stellar center , ( ii ) the lagrangian perturbation of pressure vanishes at the stellar surface , and ( iii ) the gravitational wave is only an outgoing one at infinity .",
    "the qnms of quark stars are determined by solving this eigenvalue problem , and @xmath6 is the eigenvalue of the above perturbation equations . for the treatment of the boundary condition at infinity ,",

    "therefore , such data will be subsidiarily used in statistical analyses .",
    "it should be also noted that there is a degeneracy in the dependence of @xmath0 and the lowest @xmath1 mode qnm complex frequencies on the bag model parameters @xmath27 and @xmath2 . as for high frequency gravitational waves , a dual - type detector has been proposed , which would reach very good spectral strain sensitivities ( @xmath110 ) in a considerable broadband ( between @xmath111 and @xmath112 )  @xcite and then open a new interesting window to the qnms of compact objects .",
    "as long as we have data with tolerable accuracy in future , we will be able to perform statistical analyses to fit them and get constraints on both the bag constant and the @xmath3 quark mass .",
    "if we have further information about the bag constant or the @xmath3 quark mass by utilizing the eos models based on future developments in an effective theory of qcd , such as perturbation theories or finite - temperature lattice data , we can constrain them more strictly . including independent observations of the radiation radius  e.g .",
