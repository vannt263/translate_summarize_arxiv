    "large number of pions with energies below or of the order of a few hundred mev are commonly produced in high energy hadronic or nuclear collisions experiments .",
    "very soon , it has been proposed to interpret this phenomenon as resulting from classical radiation , in analogy with the classical nature of electromagnetic waves corresponding to a large number of photons .",
    "this idea has received only a marginal attention until the early @xmath0 s where it has been rediscovered and further developed , on solid theoretical grounds  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , blaizot and krzywicki studied the dynamics of a classical pion field configuration described by the non - linear sigma model , in the context of a simple idealized model of a high energy collision .",
    "they found a solution where the classical pion field oscillates coherently in a given direction in isospin space . in parallel",
    ", bjorken proposed that , in such collisions , the chiral quark condensate could be momentarily misaligned from its vacuum orientation in isospin space , resulting in a non - trivial long wavelength configuration of the pion field  @xcite .",
    "this intuitive picture corresponds to blaizot and krzywicki s solution .",
    "the `` disoriented chiral condensate '' ( dcc ) subsequently decays toward ordinary vacuum by coherent ( classical ) radiation of soft pions .",
    "the emitted pions can be though of as being in a coherent state  @xcite , schematically : r @xmath1 where  @xmath2 is the creation operator of a free pion with isospin  @xmath3 and momentum  @xmath4 and where @xmath5 is the classical source emitting pions ( summation over repeated indices is implied ) .",
    "the latter has the following form : @xmath6 that is , its orientation in isospin space is _",
    "momentum independent_. this reflects the fact that the disorientation of the pion field in isospin space is assumed to be constant in space ( in the volume occupied by the dcc ) .",
    "the classical pion field configuration corresponding to this state is therefore a superposition of waves , which oscillate in the very same direction in isospin space .",
    "one can speak of a ( linearly ) polarized field configuration  @xcite .",
    "this property is at the origin of the most striking signature of the dcc , namely the anomalously large event - by - event fluctuations of the neutral fraction of the _ total _ number of radiated pions @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of pions of type @xmath9 . indeed , exploiting isospin symmetry of strong interactions , it is an easy exercise to show that the probability distribution of the above ratio is given by the inverse square root law ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath10 this is a direct manifestation of the coherence of the dcc state and is to be contrasted with the sharply peaked binomial distribution one obtains in the case of incoherent pion production . in particular , the probability that less than @xmath11 of the total number of radiated pions be neutral",
    "is expected to be as large as @xmath12 .",
    "this striking property is at the basis of all present strategies for experimental searches ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although it had been understood that the dcc field configuration is a solution of the low energy dynamics of strong interactions , a microscopic understanding of its possible formation was still lacking .",
    "an important progress has been made in this respect in 1993 , when k.  rajagopal and f.  wilczek realized that a classical long wavelength pion field configuration could indeed be formed during the out of equilibrium chiral phase transition in heavy ion collisions : the rapid expansion of the system results in a sudden suppression of initial fluctuations ( quenching ) which in turn triggers a dramatic amplification of soft pion modes  @xcite .      to model the dynamics of the",
    "far from equilibrium chiral phase transition , rajagopal and wilczek considered the classical @xmath13 linear sigma model , with action @xmath14 the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are related to physical quantities via : @xmath18 m_^2 = m_^2 - 2 f_^2 = ( f_^2 - v^2 ) , h = f_m_^2 .",
    "@xmath18and are chosen so that @xmath19  mev , @xmath20  mev and @xmath21  mev .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion are evolved numerically on a lattice for a given initial field configuration . the dramatic effect of expansion",
    "is modeled by assuming an instantaneous quench from above to below the critical temperature at initial time . in practice ,",
    "the values of the field @xmath22 and its first time derivative @xmath23 are chosen as independent random variables at each site of a lattice .",
    "they are sampled from gaussian distributions centered at @xmath24 , corresponding to a high temperature symmetric phase , and with variances ( in lattice units ) @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which are _ smaller _ than what they would be in the high temperature phase , thereby describing quenched fluctuations .",
    "= 7.cm    the main result of ref .",
    "@xcite is reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : rajwil ] , which shows the squared amplitude of different field modes as a function of time : due to the far from equilibrium initial condition , one observes a dramatic amplification of low momentum modes of the pion field at intermediate times .",
    "this phenomenon is analogous to that of domain formation after quenching a ferromagnet , or to the growth of quantum fluctuation during the preheating of the early universe after a period of inflation .",
    "it can be qualitatively understood in a mean - field approximation  @xcite : at early times , the local curvature of the effective potential ( effective mass squared ) is negative and soft modes , for which the associated effective frequency is imaginary , experience amplification .",
    "this is the so - called spinodal instability , well known in condensed matter or nuclear physics . at intermediate times",
    ", the periodic oscillations of field averaged value around the minimum of its effective potential trigger a further amplification via the mechanism of parametric resonance  @xcite .    in terms of the underlying quantum dynamics ,",
    "the amplification of fourier modes amplitudes is to be interpreted as the formation of a classical configuration of the pion field . because of expansion , which eventually causes interactions to freeze out",
    ", the system may be left in such a configuration and subsequently decay through coherent pion emission .",
    "this proposal has attracted much attention and the quench scenario has been extensively studied and further developed . in particular , quantum effects in the mean field approximation",
    "have been included ( see e.g.   @xcite ) and the drastic quench approximation has been abandoned in favor of a description taking explicitely expansion into account  @xcite . in this context , the importance of initial conditions has been pointed out  @xcite .",
    "it has been realized that , in most cases , initial fluctuations are not suppressed efficiently enough and expansion hardly drive the system into a region of instability .",
    "this observation led to the conclusion that the formation of a strong pion field is a rare phenomenon . exploiting the assumption of local equilibrium at initial time , it has been possible to estimate the probability that a potentially observable signal is produced in this scenario  @xcite",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for central pb - pb collisions at cern sps energies ,",
    "this analysis yields the upper bound @xmath27 where `` observable '' means that the number of produced dcc pions is required to be greater than a typical multiplicity fluctuation  @xcite .",
    "note that this estimate is obtained within the quench scenario and , therefore , corresponds to a conditional probability , which assumes that the conditions leading to a quench are met .",
    "thus the dcc is expected to be a fairly rare phenomenon , a fact which has important implications .",
    "for instance , it is very unlikely that more than one `` observable '' dcc domain be formed in a single collision .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the phenomenon should be looked for on an event - by - event basis ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the quench scenario has been widely accepted as a microscopic description of dcc formation in heavy ion collisions and , as such , has been extensively used for dcc phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "paradoxically , the expected large event - by - event fluctuations of the neutral ratio ( cf . eq .",
    "( [ neutralfluct ] ) ) have never been observed in actual simulations of the out - of - equilibrium phase transition  @xcite .",
    "of course , deviations from the perfect law ( [ neutralfluct ] ) were expected on the basis of a microscopic model underlying the original picture of a perfectly polarized dcc , cf .",
    "( [ dccstate ] ) and ( [ polarized ] ) .",
    "however , the complete absence of large fluctuations in the quench scenario suggests that this idealized picture is far from being realized in the context of the far - from - equilibrium chiral phase transition  @xcite .",
    "whether the original picture is realized or not in a realistic model is a question of great phenomenological importance and requires a careful investigation .",
    "if the rapid suppression of initial fluctuations provides a robust mechanism leading to the formation of a strong coherent pion field , it is not clear whether it can explain the hypothetical polarization ( [ polarized ] ) originally proposed .",
    "the key point is to realize that the usual assumption of a ( locally ) thermalized initial state implies that the field modes are completely uncorrelated at initial time : they are independent ( gaussian ) random numbers .",
    "therefore , in order to generate a dcc configuration , the microscopic mechanism at work needs not only to be efficient in amplifying the modes amplitudes , but it should also build correlations between amplified modes .    to study this question , we have performed a detailed statistical analysis of generic pion field configurations produced after a quench , with particular emphasis on their isospin structure  @xcite . for this purpose , it is sufficient to consider the original model of rajagopal and wilczek  @xcite , which exhibits all the relevant physical features . in particular , the classical field approximation allows one to take into account the full nonlinearities , which are crucial for the study of correlations .",
    "we sample initial field configurations in the gaussian statistical ensemble described in sec .",
    "[ sec : quench ] , and we follow the exact time evolution of each configuration by solving numerically the equations of motion corresponding to the classical action ( [ action ] ) . in this way , we can study the produced configurations on an event - by - event basis . to analyze the isospin orientations of distinct field modes , a sensitive observable",
    "is the neutral fraction of pions in each mode * k * , defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the averaged occupation numbers corresponding to the classical field configuration at the time @xmath30 of measurement : @xmath31 here @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the fourier component of the field and its time derivative respectively and @xmath34 is the free pion dispersion relation .    in the quench approximation , where the initial fluctuations are suppressed by hand , the system is initially unstable and all initial configurations undergo a dramatic amplification , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : rajwil ] .",
    "this procedure therefore selects the interesting events . to distinguish between different mechanisms responsible for amplification",
    ", we analyze the properties of the statistical ensemble at various final times @xmath30 .",
    "the plots presented here are obtained for @xmath35  fm , corresponding to the end of the spinodal instability , but the results to be discussed below are found to be insensitive to this choice .",
    "= 6.5 cm    let us concentrate on the amplified long wavelength modes , which are the one we are interested in .",
    "the event - by - event distribution of the neutral fraction ( [ ratio ] ) for the zero mode ( the most amplified ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mode ] . at a given time , all the amplified modes exhibit a similar distribution . in particular , we observe that nothing significant happens concerning their isospin structure : the neutral fraction distribution is essentially the same as the corresponding one in the initial ensemble .",
    "the latter can be computed exactly  @xcite and is represented by the dashed line in fig .",

    ", it reads @xmath36 \\ , ,   \\label{indist}\\ ] ] where @xmath37    \\left ( \\frac{\\omega + 1}{\\omega - ( 1 - 2f ) } \\right)^{3/2 } \\ , , \\ ] ] and , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the variances of the fourier components of the field and its time derivative respectively . ]",
    "@xmath40 although not exactly  @xmath41 , the distribution is very broad , exhibiting large fluctuations around the mean value @xmath42 , which is the relevant point for phenomenology .",
    "as emphasized above , these fluctuations are a direct manifestation of the classical nature of the field modes .",
    "the small deviations from the perfect law ( [ polarized ] ) come from the fact that the latter are not strictly linearly polarized  @xcite .    however , we find that the that distinct modes have completely independent polarizations in isospin space , as can be seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : correl ] , which shows the correlation between the neutral fractions in different ( amplified ) modes .",
    "these modes oscillate coherently , but their directions of oscillation in isospin space are completely random . in other words ,",
    "different modes act as independent dccs .",
    "= 6.5 cm    this has the important phenomenological consequence that the large event - by - event fluctuations of the neutral fraction are rapidly washed out when the contributions of several modes are added in a momentum bin  as commonly done in experimental analysis  even when one limits one s attention to soft modes only .",
    "this is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : bin ] , where we show the neutral fraction distribution in a bin containing @xmath43 modes .",
    "the expected signal is considerably reduced , already for such a small bin .",
    "this explains the absence of large fluctuations reported in previous works  @xcite , where the authors typically considered the contribution of a large number of modes .",
    "in conclusion , contrarily to what is usually assumed , the non - linear dynamics does not build the required correlation between modes : the state produced in the simplest form of the quench scenario , where no correlations are present initially , is not the originally proposed dcc .",
    "our detailed analysis reveals that a more realistic picture is that of a superposition of waves having independent orientations in isospin space : an `` unpolarized '' dcc configuration , as depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : dccs ] .",
    "= 6.5 cm    of course , one can not exclude the possibility that the required correlations between modes be indeed ( partially ) formed in actual nuclear or hadronic collisions by means of some other mechanism .",
    "the resulting configuration would lie between the two extreme pictures represented on fig .",
    "[ fig : dccs ] .",
    "our point here is that there exits , at present , no microscopic justification for the polarized dcc state which has been looked for so far in experiments  @xcite .",
    "instead , within our present theoretical understanding of dcc formation in heavy ion collisions , one expects an unpolarized state to be produced .",
    "it is , therefore , important to take this information into account in further theoretical as well as experimental investigations .",
    "since it has been proposed in the early 1990 s , the idea that a dcc might be formed in high energy collisions experiments has triggered an intense activity , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "attempts to detect this phenomenon include the t-864 minimax experiment , a dedicated search in proton - antiproton collisions at the fermilab tevatron  @xcite , or event - by - event analysis of pb - pb collisions by the wa98 and na49 collaborations at cern sps  @xcite . no clear experimental evidence for dcc formation has been reported so far .",
    "this is a bit disappointing in view of the fact that the phenomenon seems so natural , at least in the context of heavy ion collisions .",
    "indeed , the growth of long wavelength fluctuations after a quench is a generic phenomenon , observed in many actual situations , for example in condensed matter experiments , and which is likely to happen in heavy ion collisions as well .",
    "in particular , it has been shown to occur in various different models  @xcite .",
    "the absence of experimental evidence may indicate that the appropriate conditions for dcc formation have not been met yet ( see the interesting discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is argued that semi - peripheral heavy ion collisions at rhic energies might provide more favorable conditions for efficient quenching ) .    however , we would like to point out that the present experimental situation can actually be simply understood within our present theoretical understanding .",
    "indeed , the upper bound ( [ dccproba ] ) for the probability of dcc formation at sps energies is at the edge of the current experimental limit probed by the wa98 and na49 collaborations  @xcite .",
    "moreover , our results concerning the ( iso-)polarization of the dcc indicates that the phenomenon we are seeking may actually be more difficult to observe than originally thought .",
    "in particular , it would be of first interest to analyze existing data in the light of the present results and to design new strategies for future dcc searches at rhic and lhc  @xcite , taking into account its unpolarized nature .    besides providing a useful tool for the experimental study of the qcd chiral phase transition  @xcite , the detection of a dcc is of fundamental interest on its own .",
    "indeed , the possible formation of a coherent classical pion field is to be expected on very general grounds as a direct consequence of the bosonic nature of pions .",
    "this phenomenon is analogous to that of bose - einstein condensation , currently observed in condensed matter experiments .",
    "the fact that such a macroscopic wave of qcd matter may be produced is a very exciting possibility .",
    "i think it is worth the effort .",
