    "last years demonstrate a continuous increase of research activity in the field of hydrogen conductors . this can be explained by great technological perspectives of hydrogen conducting materials for applications in solid - state hydrogen fuel cells , hydrogen storage and electrochemical devices @xcite .",
    "a central problem in fuel - cell and hydrogen batteries technology is the development of cheap and efficient materials for electrochemical elements which can be used for the chemical storage and transformation of chemical to electrical energy . in the functional properties of hydrogen devices , the transport of hydrogen through the conducting part to cathode plays a key role which makes the proton transport mechanisms one of the central problems of current experimental and theoretical studies @xcite .    in the wide range of proton conducting materials , the crystals with superionic phases m@xmath0h(xo@xmath1)@xmath2 ( m = rb , cs , nh@xmath1 ;",
    "x = s , se ) are of especial interest due to their high proton conductivity coefficients which in the high temperature disordered state can reach values of the order @xmath3  @xmath4 . in these phases ,",
    "the quasi - two - dimensional proton transport is characterized by a dynamically disordered network of virtual hydrogen bonds dynamically establishing between the oxygens o(2 ) of nearest groups xo@xmath1 .",
    "although on the first sight the transport of protons in hexagonal ( 001 ) planes seems to be quite a strainforward process explained in terms of the two - stage grotthuss mechanism @xcite , the real mechanism of proton migration is still not sufficiently well examined and understood .",
    "the reason for this difficulty is a complex cooperative character of proton migration which should strongly interact with the dynamics of the ionic environment , the fact supported by numerous experimental raman , infrared , x - ray and nmr spectroscopy studies @xcite .    in the theoretical works @xcite , the two - stage grotthuss mechanism is frequently considered within phenomenological free - particle approches which typically contain two stages : ( 1 ) translation of proton within a hydrogen bond between the nearest ionic groups xo@xmath1 ; ( 2 ) inter - bond proton transfer related to reorientations of the ionic groups xo@xmath1 .",
    "howerer , the experimental studies demonstrate that the transport of protons is a highly complex process which can be characterized as a transfer of hydrogen ion in the course of the reactions of creation and breaking of hxo@xmath1 bonds . as a consequence of such reacting environment with dynamically redistributing electronic density , the protons in conducting materials",
    "can not be described as almost free particles .    despite the existing theoretical studies of the low - temperature proton ordered phases and proton conduction in m@xmath0h(xo@xmath1)@xmath2 by phenomenological models @xcite , up to date",
    "there is no first - principle - investigations of these systems .",
    "the recent first - principle molecular dynamics studies of superprotonic phase transition in a related superionic system cshso@xmath1 @xcite were focused on the structural transformations and reorientational motion ofhso@xmath5 groups , without the studies of the proton migration mechanism .",
    "another _ ab - initio _ study of the proton conduction in cshso@xmath1 has beed devoted to the estimation of diffusion barriers , without a detailed consideration of the role of oxygen network in the proton transport mechanism @xcite .",
    "the lack of the first - principle investigations of the transport mechanism in m@xmath0h(xo@xmath1)@xmath2 can be explained by highly complicated crystal structure of these systems involving several structural transformations which makes _ ab - initio _ calculations extremely time - consuming and challenging .",
    "our present studies of the hydrogen transport are based on the density functional theory ( dft ) with the use of the linearized augmented plane wave method ( lapw ) implemented in the wien2k package @xcite .",
    "the lda ( local density with nonlinear core corrections ) and gga ( generalized gradient ) approximations of the dft developed by perdew , burke and ernzerhof @xcite , and perdew and zunger @xcite have been employed in our calculations . in the gga",
    ", the additional gradient terms of the electron density are added to the exchange - correlation energy and its corresponding potential , which is beyond the local density approximation ( lda ) of the dft . in our studies of the proton migration paths ,",
    "we also employ a nudged - elastic - band method within the pseudopotential approach implemented in the quantum espresso package @xcite which allows to perform the dynamical relaxation of the atomic surrounding along the steps of the proton conduction processes .    as an attempt to account for the coupling of mobile protons with the dynamical distortions of the groups xo@xmath1 ,",
    "the existing microscopic description of the proton transport considers the interaction of protons with the displacements of the vertex oxygens o(2 ) of xo@xmath1 involved in the hydrogen bonding@xcite .",
    "such a coupling is presented in terms of the interaction of proton charge with the optical phonon modes corresponding to the anti - phase stretching vibrations of the o(2)-ions and is classified in terms of `` protonic polaron '' concept .",
    "the calculated in this approach coefficients of the proton conductivity are consistent with the experimental measurements performed in the superionic phases @xcite .",
    "however , the polaronic concept introduced in ref .   involves a number of phenomenological parameters like polaron binding energy which have been estimated by the fitting of the calculated conductivity to the experimetally measured values . to verify the role of the dynamical distortions in the proton migration mechanism , in this work we present a detailed dft study of the mechanism of hydrogen migration in the system rb@xmath0h(seo@xmath1)@xmath2 , which belongs to the m@xmath0h(xo@xmath1)@xmath2-class .    to investigate the role of the proton environment",
    ", two aspects of the hydrogen transport have been analyzed .",
    "the first aspect is related to the structure and positioning of hydrogen - bonded oxygen ions o(2 ) in the dynamical network .",
    "the present dft calculations demonstrate the strong displacements of o(2 ) from the high - symmetry positions on the three - fild axis in the equilibrium state , which allows to verify the concepts of the o(2)-structural positioning discussed in the previous x - ray and nmr studies @xcite . as the second aspect",

    "the present dft results demonstrate a central role of oxygen displacements for the migration of hydrogen and emphasize in this way a key role of the proton environment for the establishing the proton transport .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in three sections . in section",
    "[ methods ] , the theoretical methods employed in our studies are discussed .",
    "section  [ results ] presents the results of the electronic structure calculations and of the calculations of the proton migration paths and oxygen positioning . in section  [ conclusions ] , we summarize the main results and conclusions of our work .",
    "in the high - temperature disordered phase of rb@xmath0h(seo@xmath1)@xmath2 schematically shown in fig .  [ fig1](a ) , hydrogen transport occurs in a network of `` virtual '' ( equally probable ) hydrogen bonds which are occupied by a proton with equal probability @xmath6 .",
    "this network ( see fig .  [ fig1](b ) for details ) is established between the vertex oxygens o(2 ) of the tetrahedra seo@xmath1 which can be chemically bonded to the three nearest tetrahedra by hydrogen bonds .",
    "= 9.5 cm    = 6.5 cm    the experimentally deduced structure of the network of hydrogen - bonded tetrahedra at @xmath7  k projected on ( 001 ) plane is represented by the electronic difference density map in fig .",
    "this map has been calculated from the x - ray diffraction data using shelxl-93 programs .",
    "the central feature detected in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is a disorder of the hydrogen - bonded vertex oxygens o(2 ) ( shown by red dots ) between three structurally equivalent positions .",
    "the hydrogen bonds are schematically presented by the solid lines where the double black dots denote the positions for proton in a double - well potential .",
    "= 8.5 cm    in the earlier work by baranov et al .",
    "@xcite , a different concept of the structure of hydrogen - bonded network is proposed for the analysis of the x - ray diffraction data . in this concept , the oxygens o(2 )",
    "are statically located in high - symmetry positions on three - fold axis . which also implies a static character of the of seo@xmath1 tetrahedra and leads to a possibility of the movement of free protons in the disordered superionic phase .",
    "therefore , the arrangement of the vertex oxygens o(2 ) is still an open question which has a prime importance for the understanding the nature of proton transfer mechanism in these systems .    in the first concept of the structural arrangement of o(2 ) in the superionic phase of rb@xmath0h(seo@xmath1)@xmath2 signified in ref .",
    ", the oxygens o(2 ) are located in the high - symmetry positions on the three - fold axis and form weak hydrogen bonds with the length of the covalent bond o(2)-h approaching @xmath8   . in distinction from the high - symmetry case , the second type of oxygen arrangement discussed in ref .",
    "assumes the distortions of o(2 ) from the three - fold axis towards the hydrogen at the formation of the o(2)-h - o(2) bond . to prevent a break of high symmetry in the disordered superionic phase caused by such distortions , a dynamical disorder of each o(2 ) between three equally probable positions is assumed .",
    "these positions are related to each other by a rotation by @xmath9 around the three - fold axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where the three equivalent positions of distorted o(2 ) are marked by red dots ) ) .    to analyze the equilibrium positions of the oxygens",
    "o(2 ) , we performed the gga calculations of the total energy of the system for the different values of the displacements @xmath10 of the oxygen o(2 ) from the positions of the three - fold axis towards a migrating proton , a process which is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . in the calculations of the electronic structure of rb@xmath0h(seo@xmath1)@xmath2 ,",
    "the lattice constants of the unit cell of the trigonal r@xmath11 m symmetry in hexagonal coordinates were fixed to the values obtained from the structural analysis @xcite : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "technical details include a gga method developed by perdew , burke and ernzerhof @xcite on a @xmath14 @xmath15-point grid representing a mesh of 40  @xmath15-points in the first brillouin zone .",
    "the comparison of the total energy calculated for the mesh of 80  @xmath15-points gives the difference between the total energies @xmath16  ev which allows us to use the 40  @xmath15-point mesh for the gga - calculations .    the full - potential method @xcite employs an expansion of the electronic potential inside the atomic spheres via a full number of the electronically occupied local orbitals ( rb , se , o and h atoms in our case ) , whereas the potential outside the spheres is constructed as a plane - wave expansion with a plane - wave cutoff given by 667  ev .",
    "such a method allows to achieve high accuracy in the description of the electronic structure , total energy and electronic density of states .",
    "the dynamical disorder in the superionic state can not be directly described in the static density functional calculations . as a consequence , in a generated model unit cell , only a single hydrogen bond is selected from the three virtual hydrogen bonds near each seo@xmath1 group which leads to a lowering of the symmetry of the system from the rhombohedral to monoclinic . in this case , the generated structure can be considered as a static snapshot of the dynamically disordered superionic state . in the studies of the hydrogen transport mechanism we also considered a doubled unit cell , where the initial orientations of the two hydrogen bonds in the cell are chosen randomly , each bond can be dynamically broked and created in a chain of intermediate configurations generated by the nudged elastic band ( neb ) method @xcite .    in the studies of the transport mechanism",
    ", each atomic configuration has been structurally relaxed .",
    "the relaxation involves the optimization of the atomic positions by the minimization of the total energy and forces acting on the atoms in the generated unit cell . for the structural optimization ,",
    "we use a newton scheme described in ref .  .",
    "a comparison of different relaxed static configurations allows to calculate the energy barriers for the proton migration . with the obtained zero - temperature results",
    ", we also analyze the influence of temperature on the activation energies of the proton transport .",
    "to analyse in details the paths for the hydrogen migration in the relaxed surrounding , we employed the nudged - elastic - band ( neb ) method implemented in the quantum - espresso ( qe ) package of the dft calculations with the use of plane - wave basis sets and pseudopotentials @xcite . in these calculations , for the atomic cores of rb , h , se and o we employ the perdew - zunger ( pz ) norm - conserving pseudopotentials with nonlinear core corrections @xcite .",
    "our choice of pseudopotentials is justified by the facts that all characteristic features of the electronic structure calculated with the use of the full potential wien2k gga code ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) and obtained with the pz - pseudopotentials ( fig .  [ fig3](b ) ) are consistent in the energy window ( @xmath17ev ; @xmath18ev ) , where @xmath19 is the fermi energy .",
    "specifically , both approaches allow to describe the characteristic dos - peaks related to the o(2)-2p orbitals ( the energy range between @xmath19 and @xmath20  ev in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) and the dos - peak related to the 1s - orbital of h at the energy value about @xmath21  ev ( fig .  [ fig3](a ) ) which corresponds to the peak at about @xmath22  ev in fig .  [ fig3](b ) . in the gga - approach ,",
    "the energy gap between the highest filled and lowest empty electronic states is about 3.5  ev ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) which is close to experimentally discussed gap about 4  ev  @xcite in related compounds .",
    "the gga gap is larger then the gap about 1.3  ev obtained by the lda - method ( fig .  [ fig3](b ) ) due to the usual underestimation of the gap in the lda calculations , which does not influence the results of the neb studies based on the calculations of the total energy . also , we would like to note that a detailed comparison of the electronic and optical properties of several compounds like rb@xmath2o and li@xmath2o related to the constituents of rb@xmath0h(seo@xmath1)@xmath2 calculated in the lda and gga approaches shows a good consistency with the available experimental results @xcite .",
    "as the low - temperature electronic properties calculated by these two approaches are consistent , we conclude that the pz - pseudopotential approach implemented in the qe - code is sufficient to capture the physical features of the hydrogen migration in our system .",
    "= 8.5 cm    in contrast to the almost free motion of the hydrogen implemented in a wide range of the models of hydrogen transport , in the present work we consider the migration of hydrogen as a _ cooperative process _ ,",
    "the feature which can be described by the neb - approach @xcite .",
    "specifically , for each stage of the hydrogen transport , this process involves a relaxation of the atomic positions and of the distances between the different atoms . in our analysis , to better relax the positions of the atoms neighbouring to h , we perform a doubling of the unit cell which now includes four seo@xmath1 groups and two protons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) for details ) . for each position of the hydrogen in the unit cell",
    ", the coordinates of all neighbouring atoms were relaxed until the forces acting on the atoms reached their minima . in these calculations",
    ", we use the plane - wave cutoff 1020  ev and the energy cutoff for charge and potential given by 2040  ev .    in the neb - approach",
    ", the relaxation of the atomic positions along the hydrogen migration path is performed by the minimization of the total energy of each intermediate configuration ( image ) .",
    "these images correspond to different positions of h on the migration path and produced by the optimization of a specially generated object functional ( action ) with the consequent minimization of the spring forces perpendicular to the path . in our calculations ,",
    "the convergence criteria for the norm of the force orthogonal to the path is achieved at the values below 0.05ev /  .",
    "the experiments ( see ref .  ) show that in m@xmath0h(xo@xmath1)@xmath0-crastals the temperature of the superionic phase transition @xmath23 does not depend on the deuterization .",
    "moreover , the neutron diffraction results @xcite do not distinguish two distinct hydrogen positions on the bonds and justify a representation oh hydrogen atom in flat single - minimum potentials .",
    "consequently , in the present studies of the positioning of o(2 ) , the initial proton positions are fixed to the centers of hydrogen bonds . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , such a single - well approximation is identified by the centering of proton between the oxygens o(2 ) .    to study the modification of the total energy caused by the relaxation of the vertex oxygens , the positions of o(2 ) on a selected hydrogen bond",
    "were shifted by a distance @xmath10 , while the coordinates of other atoms were kept in the undistorted high - symmetry state .",
    "[ fig4 ] demonstrates the variation of the total energy of the system @xmath24 with the increase of the o(2 ) displacement parameter @xmath10 .",
    "one can see that the lowest value of @xmath25 corresponds to @xmath26   which implies a stabilization of a short hydrogen bond o(2)-h - o(2) of a length 2.54   where the length of the covalent bond o(2)-h equals 1.27   .",
    "it is remarkable that despite the central - point approximation for the proton within the hydrogen bonds , the obtained length of the h - bond is typical for double - well h - bonds and is consistent with the results of x - ray and neutron scattering studies@xcite , which becomes clear from the comparison of different data with the present results presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "consequently , our findings clearly support the second concept of the oxygen - distorted network structure which is characterized by the two types of dynamical disorder in the superionic phase : ( i ) the statistical disorder of the hydrogens between the virtual hydrogen bonds in hexagonal planes and ( ii ) the disorder of the vertex oxygens between three symmetry - related positions around the three - fold axis indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    to demonstrate the influence of the displacements of o(2 ) on the electronic properties , we have analyzed the projected atomic densities of electronic states for @xmath27 and @xmath26   which are presented in fig .  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the considered two types of the structural positioning of o(2 ) can be characterized by a substantial electronic hybridization of h 1s orbitals and 2p orbitals of o(2 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the s - p hybridization can be identified by the density peaks at the energies about @xmath28  ev and in the range @xmath29@xmath30  ev below the fermi energy ( for @xmath26   , these peaks are marked by a dashed line ) .",
    "the dos peaks at about @xmath31  ev imply also a strong hybridization between h 1s and o(2 ) 2s orbitals .",
    "the displacements of o(2 ) from the high - symmetry positions lead to a shortening of the o(2)-h distances and consequently to a significant increase of the s - p hybridization peaks at @xmath32  ev .",
    "moreover , the o(2)-distortions result in the emergence of new strongly hybridized state at @xmath33  ev .",
    "in addition , the displacements of o(2 ) induce the distortions of the seo@xmath1 tetrahedra which results in the lowering of the local symmetry and in the split of high hybridized peaks around @xmath31  ev ( fig .  [ fig5 ] , case @xmath26   ) . in the considered model unit cell , instead of the virtual h - bonds we consider a number of selected configurations with the fixed h - bonds near each seo@xmath1 group . in a real statistically disordered system",
