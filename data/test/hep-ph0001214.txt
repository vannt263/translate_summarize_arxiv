    "my talk concerns recent progress in the possibility of transverse quark polarization measurement .",
    "this is interesting in many aspects , and one of the most important of them is quarks transversity distribution in proton @xmath5 measurement .",
    "let me recall that there are three most important ( twist-2 ) parton distribution functions ( pdf ) in a nucleon : a non - polarized distribution function @xmath6 , longitudinal spin distribution @xmath7 and transversal spin distribution @xmath5 .",
    "the first two have been more or less successfully measured experimentally in classical deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments , but the measurement of the last one is especially difficult since it belongs to the class of the so - called helicity odd structure functions and can not be seen there . to do this",
    ", one needs to know the transversal polarization of a quark scattered from a transversally polarized target .",
    "there are several ways to do this :    1 .   to measure the polarization of a self - analyzing hadron into which the quark fragmentizes in a semi - inclusive dis , e.g. @xmath8-hyperon@xcite .",
    "the drawback of this method , however , is a rather low rate of quark fragmentation into @xmath8-particle ( @xmath9 ) and especially that it is mostly sensitive to @xmath10-quark polarization .",
    "2 .   to measure a spin - dependent t - odd parton fragmentation function ( pff ) @xcite responsible for the left - right asymmetry in fragmentation of a transversally polarized quark with respect to quark momentum ",
    "spin plane .",
    "( the so - called `` collins asymmetry '' @xcite . ) 3 .   to measure the transversal handedness in multiparticle parton fragmentation @xcite , i.e. the correlation of quark spin 4-vector @xmath11 and particle momenta @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the last two methods are comparatively new , and only the last years some experimental indications the the t - odd pff and the transversal handedness have appeared @xcite .",
    "last praha - spin conference i have presented details of these experiments @xcite .",
    "now i shortly repeat the result of t - odd pff measurements ( sect .",
    "2 ) and concentrates on its application for estimation of the proton transversity distribution ( sect .",
    "3 ) , using the recently measured azimuthal asymmetry in semi - inclusive dis . sect .",
    "4 is reserved for conclusions .",
    "the transfer of nucleon polarization to quarks is investigated in deep - inelastic polarized lepton  polarized nucleon scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "the corresponding nucleon spin structure functions for the longitudinal spin distribution @xmath15 and transversal spin distribution @xmath16 for a proton are well known .",
    "the _ inverse _ process , the spin transfer from partons to a final hadron , is also of fundamental interest .",
    "analogies of @xmath17 and @xmath16 are functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which describe the fragmentation of a non - polarized quark into a non - polarized hadron and a longitudinally or transversely polarized quark into a longitudinally or transversely polarized hadron , respectively .",
    "these fragmentation functions are integrated over the transverse momentum @xmath20 of a quark with respect to a hadron . with @xmath20 taken into account ,",
    "new possibilities arise . using the lorentz- and p - invariance",
    "one can write , in the leading twist approximation , 8 independent spin structures @xcite .",
    "most spectacularly it is seen in the helicity basis where one can build 8 twist-2 combinations , linear in spin matrices of the quark and hadron @xmath21 , @xmath22 with momenta @xmath23 , @xmath24 . especially interesting is a new t - odd and helicity even structure that describes a left ",
    "right asymmetry in the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark : @xmath25 where the coefficient @xmath26 is a function of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath27 , quark transversal momentum @xmath28 and @xmath29 is an average transverse momentum .    in the case of fragmentation to a non - polarized or a zero spin hadron , not only @xmath30 but also the @xmath26 term will survive . together with its analogies in distribution functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , this opens a unique chance of doing spin physics with non - polarized or zero spin hadrons ! in particular , since the @xmath26 term is helicity - odd , it makes possible to measure the proton transversity distribution @xmath16 in semi - inclusive dis from a transversely polarized target by measuring the left - right asymmetry of forward produced pions ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the problem is that , first , this function is completely unknown both theoretically and experimentally and should be measured independently .",
    "second , the function @xmath26 is the so - called t - odd fragmentation function : under the naive time reversal @xmath33 and @xmath21 change sign , which demands a purely imaginary ( or zero ) @xmath26 in the contradiction with hermiticity .",
    "this , however , does not mean the break of t - invariance but rather the presence of an interference term of different channels in forming the final state with different phase shifts , like in the case of single spin asymmetry phenomena  @xcite .",
    "a simple model for this function could be found in  @xcite .",
    "it was also conjectured  @xcite that the final state phase shift can be averaged to zero for a single hadron fragmentation upon summing over unobserved states @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the situation here is far from being clear .",
    "meanwhile , the data collected by delphi ( and other lep experiments ) give a unique possibility to measure the function @xmath26 .",
    "the point is that despite the fact that the transverse polarization of a quark ( an antiquark ) in z@xmath35 decay is very small ( @xmath36 ) , there is a nontrivial correlation between transverse polarizations of a quark and an antiquark in the standard model : @xmath37 , which reaches rather high values at @xmath38 peak : @xmath39 and @xmath40 . with the production cross section ratio @xmath41",
    "this gives the value @xmath42 for the average over flavors .",
    "the spin correlation results in a peculiar azimuthal angle dependence of produced hadrons ( the so - called `` one - particle collins asymmetry '' ) , if the t - odd fragmentation function @xmath26 does exist  @xcite . the first probe of it was done three years ago  @xcite by using a limited delphi statistics with the result @xmath43 , as averaged over quark flavors .",
    "a simpler method has been proposed recently by an amsterdam group @xcite .",
    "they predict a specific azimuthal asymmetry of a hadron in a jet around the axis in direction of the second hadron in the opposite jet : dependence for @xmath44 and @xmath45 integrated over @xmath46 . ] @xmath47 ^ 2 c_{tt}^{q\\bar",
    "q}{\\sin^2\\theta_2\\over    1+\\cos^2\\theta_2}\\cos(2\\phi_1)\\right ) \\label{mulders}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the polar angle of the electron and the second hadron momenta @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the azimuthal angle counted off the @xmath51-plane .",
    "this looks simpler since there is no need to determine the @xmath52 direction .",
    "this analysis @xcite covered the delphi data collected from 1991 through 1995 . only the leading particles in each jet of two - jet events",
    "was selected both positive and negative .",
    "the corrected for acceptance histograms in @xmath50 for each bin of @xmath48 were fitted by the expression   is due to the twist-3 contribution of usual one - particle fragmentation , proportional to the @xmath53 . ]",
    "the @xmath48-dependence of @xmath55 in the whole interval of @xmath48 was fitted according to expr .",
    "( [ mulders ] ) with the result @xmath56    the corresponding analyzing power , summed over @xmath27 and averaged over quark flavors with @xmath42 ( assuming @xmath57 is flavor - independent ) according to exp .",
    "( [ mulders ] ) is @xmath58 the systematic errors , however , are by all means larger than the statistical ones and need further investigation .",
    "recently azimuthal asymmetries in semi - inclusive hadron production on longitudinally ( hermes @xcite ) and transversally ( smc @xcite ) polarized targets where reported which together with delphi result ( [ apower ] ) allows to an estimation for transversity distribution .",
    "the t - odd azimuthal asymmetry in semi inclusive dis @xmath59 which hermes try to measure consist of two sorts of terms ( see @xcite eq .",
    "( 115 ) ) : a twist-2 asymmetry @xmath60 and a twist-3 asymmetry @xmath61 .",
    "the angle @xmath62 here is the azimuthal angle around @xmath27-axis in the direction of virtual @xmath63 momentum in the parton breit frame counted from the electron scattering plane .",
    "the first asymmetry is proportional to the @xmath64-dependent transversal quark spin distribution in a longitudinally polarized proton , @xmath65 , while the second contains two parts : one term is again proportional to @xmath65 ; and the second , to the twist-3 distribution function @xmath66 .",
    "the experimentally observed @xmath67 dependence in hermes data shows no noticeable trace of @xmath68 term .",
    "thus , as a crude approximation one can assume a smallness of @xmath69 .",
    "for the same reason @xmath70 ( see @xcite eq .",
    "( c15,c19 ) ) .",
    "this open a possibility to measure the proton transversity using the _ longitudinally _ polarized target .",
    "the asymmetry measured by hermes @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the nucleon longitudinal polarization ( @xmath73 sign means different spin directions ) averaged over transversal momenta ( assuming a gaussian distribution ) should reads as ( @xcite eq .",
    "( 115 ) ) @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are mean square of a transversal momenta of quark in the distribution and fragmentation functions .",
    "averaging separately numerator and denominator over @xmath77 and @xmath27 , and taking into account only the u - quark distribution in the proton ( @xmath78 ) which gives a dominant contribution for the @xmath79 production and assuming @xmath80 , one can obtain for asymmetry ( [ asym ] ) @xmath81\\cdot \\left[\\frac{\\langle h^{\\perp u/\\pi^+}_1(z)\\rangle } { \\langle d^{u/\\pi^+}_1(z)\\rangle } \\right ] \\cdot x\\ ] ]    experimentally @xcite , @xmath82 for @xmath79 up to @xmath83 looks like a linear function @xmath84 with @xmath85 and delphi result ( [ apower ] ) this gives an estimation for the ratio @xmath86    assuming the validity of ( [ ratio ] ) for valence parts in the whole interval of @xmath87 one could obtain an estimation for the @xmath88-quark contribution to the proton tensor charge @xmath89 that is close to the result of the chiral quark - soliton model @xcite @xmath90 and to the limit followed from the density matrix positivity constraint at @xmath91 @xcite @xmath92 .",
    "concerning the asymmetry observed by smc @xcite on transversely polarized target one can state that it agrees with the result of hermes .",
    "really , smc has observed the azimuthal asymmetry @xmath93 , where @xmath94 ( @xmath95 is the azimuthal angle of the polarization vector ) is the so - called collins angle .",
    "the raw asymmetry @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 $ ] are the target polarization value , the dilution factor and the spin transfer coefficient .",
    "the physical asymmetry @xmath99 averaged over transverse momenta ( assuming again a gaussian form ) is given by the expression ( see @xcite eq .",
    "( 116 ) ) @xmath100    integration over @xmath87 and @xmath27 , and using again the approximation of the @xmath88-quark dominance and @xmath80 gives from the experimental value @xmath101 , @xmath102 and delphi result ( [ apower ] ) @xmath103 what in agreement with the hermes ratio ( [ ratio ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , i would like to stress that there are several ways allowing one to measure the transverse quark polarization among which the use of the t - odd pff looks like the most perspective for future experiments in measuring of transversity , like compass at cern .",
    "i present the first experimental estimation for the absolute value of analyzing power of the method .",
    "of course , a more accurate measurements of it is necessary .",
    "however , even now it allows the first crude estimation of the proton transversity from observed azimuthal asymmetry in semi - inclusive dis .",
    "the most interesting discovery here is a good agreement of transversities obtained from transversally and longitudinally polarized targets due to small contribution of @xmath104 .",
    "this allows measuring the transversity in the same experiments as for @xmath105",
