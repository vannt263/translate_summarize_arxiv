    "in the past two decades , cosmology has acquired a new standing due to a wide range of observations of high precision data @xcite .",
    "these observations seem to reveal that the two dominant components of the universe are a non - baryonic form of matter , the so - called dark matter @xcite , and an exotic form of energy , dark energy @xcite .",
    "the former leads to structure formation while the latter is responsible for the present accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the search for an explanation for the existence and properties of these dark components of the universe has prompted a strong debate about their origin and nature .",
    "the behaviour of the galaxy rotation curves and the dynamical mass in clusters of galaxies suggest the existence of an exotic form of matter , dark matter , at galactic and extra galactic scales , respectively , where the presence of this sort of matter is revealed through its gravitational effects .",
    "notwithstanding , recent results demonstrated that dark matter may interact with ordinary matter , with the production of patterns of annihilations or decays of dark matter particles in the fluxes of cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "evidence for the existence of dark matter lies in the velocity dispersion of clusters that , combined with its morphological features , leads one to conclude that the overall mass should be far greater than the visible mass .",
    "in fact , the dark matter component of these clusters is well described by dark matter models , where the interaction of dark matter with baryonic matter determines the density profile of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the above mentioned problems is to consider modified theories of gravity . amongst modified gravity theories , those that introduce higher order curvature terms in the einstein ",
    "hilbert action  and , in particular , the @xmath0 theories of gravity @xcite  offer alternative explanations for these problems , along with other cosmological , astrophysical , and high - energy physics motivations @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that , in the context of power - law theories , @xmath1 , the rotation curves can be explained as a curvature effect @xcite ; a similar result @xcite can be obtained in another extension of gravity that relies not only on a non - trivial curvature term , but also on a non - minimal coupling between matter and geometry @xcite .",
    "clusters are the largest astronomical structures whose masses can be measured in a reliable form , since they constitute the largest configuration of objects that passed through gravitational relaxation and entered into virial equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the measuring methods , x - rays and gravitational lensing for visible and dark matter respectively , reveal that the masses of clusters are approximately seven to ten times larger than the total combined mass of stars and hot gas in the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "this missing mass is predominant in the inner regions of clusters , but it is also extended beyond the core radius , as defined by the gas density distribution .    in the context of modified newtonian dynamics @xcite ,",
    "another popular ( albeit incomplete @xcite ) alternative to general relativity ( gr ) , it is difficult to explain cluster observations without the assumption of `` real '' dark matter , because the mass of the dark component is otherwise significantly reduced but not completely removed @xcite .    the problem of clusters has recently been discussed in @xmath0 theories , by considering a generalized version of the virial theorem .",
    "previously discussed in the context of a possible unification and interaction of dark matter and dark energy @xcite . assuming a steady state , the virial theorem can be used to deduce the mean density of astrophysical objects , and therefore the corresponding total mass , such as galaxies and clusters , by observing the velocities of test particles moving around them .",
    "the overall mass of a sample of clusters can also be estimated through corrections in the gravitational potential that emerge in the weak field limit of these theories @xcite .",
    "along with these works , there were also conducted the first cluster abundance constraints on a modified gravity model , specifically the modified action @xmath0 model , which predict deviations in the abundance of massive dark matter halos @xcite .    in the context of the non - minimal coupling between the ricci scalar curvature and matter @xcite , it has been shown in several works that both dark energy and dark matter can be effectively described within this framework , along with other cosmological and astrophysical implications : these include the perturbed hydrostatic equilibrium of the sun @xcite , the acceleration of the universe @xcite , the galaxy rotation curves @xcite , the reheating scenario after inflation @xcite , the mimicking of a cosmological constant @xcite , and the change in the gravitational potential @xcite .    in order to extend this non - minimally coupled model one tries to obtain the large mass difference of clusters through a dark matter mimicking , an extra matter component that emerges due to the presence of the non - minimal coupling , and a subsequent modification of gravity .",
    "one first explores here the scenario of the abell cluster a586 , which is a nearby massive strong - lensing cluster , with a high x - ray luminosity , related with the mass of the intracluster gas .",
    "its morphology is well suited to the assumption of spherical symmetry , making it an ideal test bed for modifications of gravity at extra - galactic scales .",
    "one then extends this analysis to a larger set of galaxy clusters with the same features .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "first , one shortly reviews the formalism leading to the total cluster mass and the field equations that result in the presence of the non - minimal coupling and stablishes the strategy to address the problem of mimicking the dark matter component of a cluster .",
    "one then studies the particular case of the abell cluster a586 , discusses the coupling function that leads to the dark matter mimicking , and extends the model to a larger sample of galaxy clusters .",
    "finally , the numerical results are presented and discussed .",
    "galaxy clusters are usually considered as closed gravitational systems with spherical symmetry and in hydrostatic equilibrium when virial equilibrium is attained  despite the fact that recent observations reveal that clusters have more evolved structures with strong interactions and dynamical activity , particularly in their inner regions @xcite .    under these assumptions ,",
    "the structure equation can be derived from the collisionless boltzmann equation for an isotropic system @xcite ,    ( _ g _ r^2)=-_g ddr  , [ boltzmann_equation ]    where @xmath2 is the newtonian gravitational potential of the cluster , @xmath3 the mass - weighted velocity dispersion in the radial direction , and @xmath4 the gas - mass density .",

    "one tries to reproduce the total mass profiles of a sample of galaxy clusters , where the additional density component emerges not from an exotic form of `` dark '' matter but from a change in geometry due to the presence of the non - minimal coupling in the action .",
    "clusters of galaxies present a velocity dispersion with a relative constant value along the radius , which reveals an implicit matter density profile of the form @xmath13 .",
    "the singular isothermal sphere is the simplest model whose density profile , @xmath14 , leads to a constant and isotropic velocity dispersion @xmath15 along the clusters profile .",
    "however , numerical fits to the observational data show that the density profile of clusters are flatter than the isothermal one at small radii and steeper at larger radii . a general form replicating this behaviour",
    "is given by the cusped density profile ,    _ m&=_0 & ( r r_s ) ^-p(1+r r_s)^p - q  , [ cusped_profile ]    where the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 determine the respective slopes of the power - law density profile in the inner and outer regions , and @xmath18 is the so - called core radius , signaling the steepening of the profile .",

    "in fact , one of the important results of hierarchical cdm models is that the density profile of cold dark matter halos is described by the nfw model @xcite .",

    "this drives the ensuing distinction between the fits for the a586 cluster obtained in this study : indeed , as fig .",
    "[ densities ] shows , the best fit @xmath127 obtained by considering only this cluster yielded an initial plateau for the mimicked dark matter density .",

    "[ mimic2 ] ) does not have an approximately flat density for the inner region , but compensates by more closely following the observed slope of the outer regime  hence the proximity between the obtained best fit parameter @xmath176 and the value obtained from the scaling law @xmath76 , @xmath181 .",
    "this occurs because the minimization procedure of the global fit is mostly driven by the remaining thirteen chandra clusters : as it turns out , the best fit for this set ( excluding the a586 cluster ) is @xmath182 ( not shown in this study ) ; a balanced fitting solution with all fourteen clusters is thus obtained by relaxing the constraint of a flattened inner density region for the mimicked dark matter profile of the a586 cluster .",
    "the non - minimal coupling considered here may be regarded as an approximation to a more evolved form for @xmath42 , which would encompass couplings considered in previous studies , which perhaps hints at a laurent series , f_2(r ) = _ n = - ^ ( r r_n)^n  .",
    "[ laurent ]    each term would be valid in a particular regime : early _ vs. _ late time , central _",
    "vs. _ long range , galactic _ vs. _ cluster size , _",
    "etc_. in particular , this series should also include the aforementioned @xmath183 and @xmath184 terms , relevant to mimic dark matter at the galactic level , as well as a linear coupling @xmath185 considered in the context of preheating and inflationary dynamics ; the corresponding parameters are    r_-1 & & ( r_-1)^-1/2 = 21.5  gpc  , + r_-1/3 & & ( r_-1/3)^-1/2 = 1.69 10 ^ 6  gpc  , + r_1 & & r_1 ^ -1/2 = 4.8 10 ^ -29  m  ,    with @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "since the relevant coupling terms at galactic scales have negative exponents , it is trivial to conclude that their effect is negligible during inflation , when the curvature is much higher .",
    "conversely , the effect of the terms involved in preheating and inflation are irrelevant at astrophysical or cosmological scales at present .    similarly , the cosmological effect of the best fit coupling for the considered sample of clusters ( with @xmath176 ) may be disregarded , as it is of order    ( r_cosmor_n)^n ~(r_nr_h)^2n ( 10 ^ -13  kpc4.2  gpc)^0.2 ~10 ^ -4  .    where @xmath187 is the hubble radius .",
    "thus , one is left with the possible conflict between astrophysical relevant terms .",
    "if one considers three power - law couplings with @xmath183 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 , the resulting dark matter profile will not be a sum of the individual contributions , due to the non - linearity of . even if one disregards the resulting interaction between terms ( a reasonable approximation , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the exponents simply yield the slope for each derived dark matter contribution , not for their relative values .",
    "indeed , when numerically integrating , one imposes boundary conditions on the overall dark matter density ( _ i.e. _ the dimensionless function @xmath169 )  the relative contributions of each dark matter component are then determined dynamically .",
    "given the scaling relation , a larger @xmath190 implies a steeper dark matter component @xmath191 .",
    "resorting to the @xmath192 behaviour of the visible mass density eq .",
    "( [ generalized_beta ] ) and using the average value @xmath193 , this translates into    n=-1 :  _ dm ~r^-0.98  & , &  n=-1 3 :  _ dm ~r^-1.5  , + n=0.2 & : &  _ dm ~r^-2.2  .",
    "thus , the @xmath168 merely gives rise to a quickly decaying component : the @xmath183 and @xmath184 contributions eventually dominate at large distances , even if the former dominates at short ones .    in order for the contributions from the @xmath194 and @xmath188 to be neglected , it suffices that they are subdominant at cluster scales , but dominant at the long range of galactic scales .",
    "one does not pursue an explicit computation of the effect of these three power - law terms here , given that the main scope was to describe clusters .",
    "nevertheless , it is not difficult to see that the difference between the galactic and cluster typical densities do allow for a consistent disentangling of the effects of these two sets of terms .",
    "in this work , the possibility of mimicking the dark matter component of a galaxy cluster in the context of a model , , where the scalar curvature is non - minimally coupled with matter is discussed .",
    "for that , one first assesses the viability of the model using the relaxed abell a586 cluster , given the availability of quality data for most of its relevant dynamical parameters .    using a power - law non - minimal coupling @xmath195 ,",
    "one obtains the best fit for @xmath127 , with a strong constraint on the typical length scale @xmath196 arising from the requirement that the induced extra - force is smaller than the newtonian one .",
    "a weaker constraint @xmath197 arises from the requirement that the coupling is perturbative , @xmath173 .",
    "the obtained fit does not correspond to the analytical value for @xmath82 computed from the scaling relation between dark and visible matter , as the latter would give rise to a mimicked dark matter density that does not follow the observational curve ( although its outer behaviour exhibits the same slope ) .",
    "instead , a shift from this analytical value is enforced , whereas the mimicked density is slightly steeper than the observed profile , but with a negligible difference in total mass .",
    "furthermore , the exponent @xmath82 is large enough to keep the non - minimal coupling perturbative , with @xmath198 .",
    "this suppresses the destabilizing effect of the outward extra - force arising from the non - conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , as previously found in the context of galaxy rotation curves ( where two negative exponents @xmath183 and @xmath184 were shown to correspond to the best fit for the rotation curves ) @xcite .",
    "subsequently , this dark matter mimicking mechanism was successfully extended to a large sample of galaxy clusters using the available profiles for the visible matter density and temperature obtained from modifications of the usual @xmath25-model , eq .",
    "( [ visible_profile ] ) , and the polytropic temperature profile , eq .",
    "( [ temperature_profile ] ) @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "one has used the same power - law coupling function , obtaining an exponent @xmath176 from a simultaneous fit to all considered clusters . as in the detailed case of the abell a586 cluster ,",
    "the fitting procedure is also independent of the length scale @xmath143 , as long as the coupling is perturbative , @xmath173 . by the same token",
    ", a more stringent upper bound of @xmath199 is obtained from the requirement that the extra force due to non - geodesic motion is much smaller than the newtonian force .",
    "the fitting procedure depends on the underlying model , but also on several other assumptions  namely , sphericity , virialization , and thermal equilibrium .",
    "clearly , deviations from any of these hypotheses will introduce an undetermined bias into the best fit scenario : the choice of the abell 586 cluster as a initial test case was motivated by the wish to minimize these sources of error , as this cluster is very well characterized and has a good spherical morphology @xcite .    in galaxy clusters with more evolved structures",
    ", one may observe deviations due to the presence of non - sphericity and non - thermal pressure support , and the density profile may be much rougher than in well - behaved clusters .",
    "however , an adequate description of the mimicked dark matter content was obtained for clusters with more evolved internal structures , namely rxj1159 + 5531 , mkw 4 and usgc s152 , thus supporting the universality and robustness of the proposed mimicking mechanism .",
    "studies addressing different scenarios have resorted to power - law couplings with different exponents than the best fit value @xmath168 here reported  which may be regarded as another term in a putative series expansion of a more general non - minimal coupling .",
    "the specific form of the coupling function can only be obtained from its consideration in different scenarios , in order to reconstitute its full functional dependence on the ricci scalar curvature .",
    "thus , the relevance of each term in the several scenarios considered in previous works was also discussed . by the same reasoning , yet unprobed terms of this series may be charted through the study of other phenomena and environments ( ranging from astrophysical to cosmological scales ) , where distinct curvatures and densities are at play .      d.  n.  spergel _ et al . _ [ wmap collaboration ] , , 377 ( 2007 ) [ http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0603449[arxiv:astro-ph/0603449 ] ] ; g.  hinshaw _ et al .",
