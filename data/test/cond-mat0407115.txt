    "self - organized criticality may be the underlying cause of power laws in a wide range of natural and man - made phenomena  @xcite .",
    "systems exhibiting self - organized criticality naturally approach a critical state , without any intrinsic time or distance scales .",
    "the critical point is reached without any fine - tuning of parameters .",
    "this is unlike most critical points seen in physics  for example , the ising model is only critical at a single , very specific , temperature .",
    "this lack of fine - tuning is essential if we are to understand power laws in nature , where no fine - tuning is possible .",
    "since the concept of self - organized criticality was first introduced by bak , tang , and wiesenfeld in 1987 , a number of models have been developed to investigate this phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "however , the original model , the two - dimensional , isotropic , abelian sandpile model ( asm ) , is still one of the simplest and most interesting of the models . the asm is simple and robust , which are necessary features for any model of self - organized criticality . while natural phenomena are quite complex , any model that seeks to explain the ubiquity of power laws in nature must , paradoxically , be very simple ; if we are to have a robust model for the generation of power laws , we must neither have finely - tuned parameters , nor finely - tuned rules .",
    "the asm is defined on a lattice of sites , and is described by a toppling matrix @xmath1 , whose dimension is equal to the number of sites in the sandpile .",
    "the sandpile evolves stochastically .",
    "in each time step , a grain of sand is added to a random site .",
    "then , sites are checked for stability .",
    "if the number of grains at a site @xmath2 is greater than @xmath3 , then the site @xmath2 is unstable , and topples , losing @xmath4 grains , while every other site @xmath5 gains -@xmath6 grains .",
    "( generally , @xmath7 is zero except when @xmath5 neighbors @xmath2 . ) typically , models are conservative , which means that each toppling in the bulk conserves the total number of grains ( @xmath8 ) . only for topplings along the boundary , where grains can fall off the edge , can the total number of grains change .",
    "we continue toppling unstable sites until no sites are unstable .",
    "then , we begin a new time step , and again add a grain to a random site .",
    "the asm is surprisingly tractable  @xcite .",
    "we only briefly cover some of the essential points here  for comprehensive reviews , see  @xcite .",
    "after a large number of time steps , the asm reaches a well - defined distribution of states . of the stable height configurations , some are transient , and occur with probability zero after a long amount of time .",
    "all other states are recurrent , and occur with equal probability .",
    "dhar showed that the total number of recurrent states is just @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "this is also equal to the number of spanning trees that can be drawn on the lattice , showing a connection between the sandpile and spanning tree problems  @xcite .",
    "these statements hold for all asms , which define a large class of models .",
    "now , we specialize to the two - dimensional , conservative , isotropic asm , which is defined on a two - dimensional square lattice , where each site has a maximum height of four , and where upon toppling at any site , one grain is sent to each of the site s four neighbors .",
    "furthermore , we work in the limit where the lattice is infinite .",
    "the two - dimensional , isotropic , spanning tree problem is equivalent to the central charge -2 logarithmic conformal field theory ( @xmath10 lcft )  @xcite , which has the simple gaussian action @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are complex grassman variables .",
    "the @xmath10 lcft is described in  @xcite .",
    "while the two - dimensional , conservative , isotropic asm is just one of many possible asms , it is the original , standard , model  @xcite , and it is reasonable to simply refer to it as `` the asm , '' which we do for the remainder of this paper .",
    "calculations of correlation functions , using methods to be described in the next section , have confirmed that there is a relationship between the asm and @xmath10 lcft .",
    "two - point correlation functions of unit height variables decay as @xmath14 in the bulk  @xcite , as do all two - point height correlations along open and closed boundaries  @xcite ; these correlations can be understood as equivalent to correlations of lcft operators .",
    "furthermore , calculations of certain three - point correlation functions of heights along closed boundaries , and all multipoint correlations of heights along open boundaries , have allowed lcft field identifications for heights along boundaries  @xcite .",
    "the asm is not robust to all perturbations . if we relax the constraint that the model be conservative , and instead allow grains to be lost in any bulk toppling ( i.e. allow dissipation ) , correlations decay exponentially , and we are taken off the critical point  @xcite .",
    "the condition of conservation can be considered a `` natural '' one , rather than one requiring `` fine - tuning . ''",
    "deeper probes of the the conformal structure can be obtained by looking at correlations both on and off the critical point .",
    "mahieu and ruelle calculated a number of off - critical correlation functions of certain height configurations , known as weakly allowed clusters ( wacs ) , and used their correlation functions to propose field identifications for the 14 simplest wacs  @xcite .",
    "they found that their correlation functions could be explained by assuming that all 14 wacs took the form    @xmath15    the coefficients @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 vary from wac to wac .",
    "@xmath20 is the probability for the cluster at the critical point , and @xmath21 is the mass , a measure of how far the model is from the critical point .",
    "the correlation functions that they used were mostly two - point functions along horizontal or diagonal axes , as well as some three - point and four - point functions for the two simplest wacs .    while these calculations provide strong evidence for the identification of the asm with the @xmath10 lcft , and the field identification in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lcft.rep ] ) , the fact that only specific correlations were considered limits the range of the identification . it would be surprising if new orientations of correlation functions , or new wacs , were found to be inconsistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : lcft.rep ] ) ; but the calculations in  @xcite do not rule this possibility out . more importantly , since each correlation function in  @xcite required a new and separate calculation , it is hard to understand , mathematically , why these results occured . while their end results showed that certain correlations of wacs in the asm are equal to correlations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lcft.rep ] ) in the lcft , it was not mathematically transparent as to why this should be . nor was it clear why , or if , the same coefficients would appear in other properties , such as off - boundary correlations , or correlations with defects .    here , we calculate all correlation functions of all local bond modifications ( lbms ) , for arbitrary numbers and types of lbms at arbitrary positions ( far from one another ) ; our calculations confirm that all lbms should receive the field identification in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lcft.rep ] ) . by lbms , we mean any set of local changes in the sandpile toppling rules . for the asm at the critical point",
    ", we will assume that the lbms are conservative ( do not create or destroy grains ) .",
    "since all wacs can be calculated by lbms , our results automatically include all correlations of wacs .",
    "while the wacs are the most important types of lbms , and the easiest to find probabilities of , in numerical simulations , we generally discuss our results in terms of lbms , to emphasize the generality of our results .",
    "we give closed form expressions for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath22 and describe methods that allow rapid calculation of these coefficients . while a computer is needed for the calculation of specific @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 coefficients , the general calculations can be done by hand .    by showing how calculation for all lbms can be done at once",
    ", we make the mathematical structure clearer .",
    "for example , we can quickly see why the coefficients @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 appear in other properties .",
    "we illustrate this by looking at off - boundary lbm probabilities , and correlations with bond defects ( either in the bulk , or along a boundary ) .",
    "interestingly , we find that some bond defects are represented by a lcft operator with a scaling dimension of four ; this is , to the best of our knowledge , the first dimension four operator found in the asm .    while our calculations have been done in both the normal asm , and the asm with dissipation , we focus our discussion on the simpler analysis at the critical point , and only discuss the more complicated massive correlations in the last section , and in the appendices .",
    "the methods used in this paper are not powerful enough to calculate probabilities and correlations for any height configurations .",
    "even the calculation of the probability for a site to have height two requires much more complicated methods  @xcite , and the correlation function of two height two variables remains unknown .",
    "this is because the condition for a site to have height two involves a nonlocal condition .",
    "as already stated , the most important lbms are those used to calculate properties of wacs  @xcite .",
    "wacs are related to forbidden subconfigurations ( fscs ) .",
    "an fsc is a height configuration over a subset of sites @xmath23 , such that for every site @xmath24 , the number of neighbors of @xmath2 in @xmath23 is greater than or equal to the height at @xmath2 .",
    "fscs are important because asm height configurations are recurrent if and only if they have no fscs  @xcite .",
    "a wac is a height configuration that contains no fscs , but becomes a fsc if any height in the wac is decreased by one .",
    "three wacs are shown in the left side of figure  [ fig : wacs ] .",
    "wacs are analytically tractable because it turns out that the number of sandpiles with a particular wac is equal to the number of recurrent states in a sandpile with modified toppling rules  @xcite .",
    "there are actually several different ways to modify the toppling rules to obtain the wac probability .",
    "the simplest is to , for each connected piece of the wac , remove all but one of the bonds connecting it to the rest of the lattice ",
    "the modified lattices corresponding to the wacs are shown in the right side of figure  [ fig : wacs ] .",
    "( see  @xcite for a discussion of other ways in which the sandpile can be modified to obtain the wac probabilities . ) in these modified sandpiles , grains of sand can not flow along the removed bonds ; to continue to conserve the number of grains during each toppling , the condition for instability must be decreased at the sites at the end of the removed bond .",
    "these changes result in a new toppling matrix @xmath25 .",
    "as already stated , the number of recurrent states in the asm is @xmath9 .",
    "the number of recurrent states that have the wac is given by @xmath26 .",
    "( we discuss this equivalence further in section  [ sec : wac.lbm.issues ] . )",
    "so the bulk probability for the wac is given by    @xmath27    where we have defined @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the well - studied lattice green function ( at the critical point ) ; exact expressions are known for the green function between nearby sites , and asymptotic expressions for the green function between distant sites  @xcite .",
    "while @xmath1 , @xmath31 , and @xmath30 all have large dimensions ( equal to the number of sites ) , @xmath32 is zero outside of a finite collection of sites .",
    "when the bond between @xmath2 and @xmath5 is removed , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are both increased by 1 , while @xmath35 and @xmath36 are both decreased by 1 . for example , for the unit height probability , we have    @xmath37    here @xmath2 is the site fixed at height one , while @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the three sites that @xmath2 has been disconnected from .    for any wac , the fact that @xmath32 is finite - dimensional means that the height probability can be found by calculating a simple , finite - dimensional , matrix determinant . all wacs thus correspond to lbms . however , many lbms do not correspond to wacs .",
    "lbms are simply any sandpile modifications that can be modeled with a @xmath32 matrix that is conservative ( every row and column sums to zero ) and symmetric .",
    "our analysis gives all correlations of lbms , which thus automatically gives all correlations of wacs .",
    "for an @xmath41-point correlation function of lbms , we can still use this method .",
    "the only difference is that the removed bonds are located in @xmath41 distant clusters ; this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : wac.correlation ] .",
    "removal of bonds in this fashion will give @xmath42 and @xmath43 block matrix structures .",
    "for example , for a 3-point function , we will have    @xmath44    @xmath45 is the modification to the toppling matrix for the set of bonds removed about the @xmath46 lbm .",
    "@xmath47 is the green function matrix between sites of the @xmath46 lbm , and its elements are @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 is the green function matrix between the sites of the @xmath46 and @xmath51 lbms , and its elements are given by the bulk green function ,    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the euler - mascheroni constant  @xcite .",
    "we work in the limit where the lbms are all very far from each other  we assume that any two of the @xmath41 lbms are the same order - of - magnitude , @xmath54 , apart .",
    "since the green function diverges as @xmath55 with increasing @xmath56 , calculation of @xmath57 initially looks very difficult .",
    "however , every row of every @xmath45 sums to zero  this follows from the manner in which we constructed @xmath45 , and reflects the fact that grains of sand are still conserved in each toppling in the bulk of the modified sandpile .",
    "this implies that parts of @xmath49 that depend only on the column index make no contribution to @xmath58 , and thus no contribution to the correlation function , @xmath57 .",
    "so we only care about differences ( discrete derivatives ) of green functions between columns of @xmath49 , and the elements of @xmath49 are effectively @xmath59 , rather than @xmath60 .    for lbms , every @xmath45 is symmetric , so every column of every @xmath45 sums to zero . using the matrix identity @xmath61",
    ", this in turn means that the parts of @xmath49 that depend only on the row index make no contribution to the probability .",
    "this is , in effect , like taking another discrete derivative of the green function , so that the elements of @xmath49 are effectively @xmath62 .    to make this concrete ,",
    "suppose that the local origin of the @xmath46 lbm is located at @xmath63 , and the local origin of the @xmath51 lbm is located at @xmath64 .",
