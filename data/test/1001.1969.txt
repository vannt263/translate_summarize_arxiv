    "positronium ( ps ) , the bound state of electron and positron , was extensively investigated since its discovery @xcite contributing to the development of bound state qed ( see e.g. @xcite for a review on the current status of this field ) .",
    "furthermore , this system provided stringent limits on possible deviation from the standard model that could indicate new physics @xcite ( see also @xcite for a comprehensive review of former experiments ) . moreover , in the field of materials science ps found various applications due to its unique properties ( see e.g. @xcite for modern reviews on this subject ) .",
    "one recent example is the characterization via positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy ( pals ) of low - k dielectrics that are potential candidates for the next generation of integrated circuits @xcite .",
    "the motivation of the work presented in this paper is to understand if mesoporous silica with an interconnected pore network could be used for producing a high fraction of positronium at low temperatures .",
    "this would open the door for a new generation of experiments in fundamental research .",
    "cold positronium could be used to improve the precision of spectroscopic studies of ps @xcite or to perform the first spectroscopy of the ps@xmath2 molecule @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it could provide an alternative to the methods that are used for anti - hydrogen formation @xcite-@xcite . as it was suggested sometime ago @xcite-@xcite , anti - hydrogen",
    "could be formed using charge - exchange of ps with anti - protons .",
    "this was demonstrated for the charge conjugate reaction @xcite and in the atrap collaboration resonant charge exchange collisions of positrons with rydberg cs atoms were used to form rydberg ps that via charge exchange with the anti - protons produced anti - hydrogen in rydberg states @xcite .",
    "recently , two experiments @xcite were proposed to perform an anti - gravity test using this process . in both experiments ,",
    "one of the main issues is that a high fraction of ps at low temperatures should be available",
    ". another interesting application would be the possibility to perform an experiment in order to confirm the interpretation of the recent dama / libra annual modulation signal @xcite as generated by mirror type dark matter @xcite .",
    "a step further would be to achieve bose - einstein condensation of ps @xcite .",
    "this would allow the exploration for the first time of the effects of the collective properties of a matter - antimatter system .    in mesoporous silica , ps",
    "is produced by injecting positrons into the film and the distribution of the implantation depth follows a makhovian profile @xcite . in the following we solely consider the long lived triplet spin state ( called ortho - positronium with 142 ns lifetime , o - ps ) because the singlet spin state ( called para - positronium , p - ps ) has a very short lifetime of 125 ps and can be considered as annihilating in the target .",
    "the o - ps ( for simplicity we will refer to it as ps ) that diffuses into the pores loses its kinetic energy via scattering .",
    "if the pores are interconnected , the ps has a probability to tunnel from one pore to another .",
    "a fraction of the ps reaches the film surface and exits into vacuum .",
    "a classical model of thermalization process was developed by nagashima et al .",
    "their calculations reproduce very well the behavior for sio@xmath2 aerogel with pore sizes of about 100 nm . however , a classical approach is not expected to give reliable predictions for ps confined in few nm pores because quantum mechanical effects become relevant . as a matter of fact , in this regime",
    "the de broglie thermal wavelength of ps is comparable with the size of the pores .",
    "recently , mariazzi et al .",
    "@xcite considered phonon scattering to reproduce the thermalization process of ps in a box ( closed porosity ) showing that the minimal energy is not that of the lowest accessible level because the momentum phonons can exchange is fixed . in the same paper , they pointed out that this is not the case in rectangular channels because in one direction the side of the potential well tends to infinity ( z - axis ) . therefore , the magnitudes of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 momentum are quantized but the @xmath5 tends to be a continuum and the minimal energy that ps can reach is given by the ground state in the x - y components .",
    "thus measuring the ps emission energy provides a method to distinguish between the two different pores architectures ( see section [ sec : discussion ] ) .    in previous studies of ps emission in vacuum using time of flight ( tof )",
    ", many interesting effects , such as the emission from the surface of different materials @xcite-@xcite were investigated .",
    "recently , this technique was applied to study mesoporous and hybrid silica films @xcite-@xcite , to evaluate the continuity barrier @xcite and the effect of thermalization for pore surfaces decorated with different groups @xcite .",
    "however , the influence of the temperature on ps emission in vacuum from mesoporous thin films was never studied in detail .",
    "to our knowledge , only a work of mills et al .",
    "@xcite with fumed silica revealed a dependence with the temperature of the ps emission in vacuum .",
    "the fraction of ps in the low energy tail was estimated but no quantitative estimate on the value of the minimal emission energy was obtained .",
    "very recently cassidy et al .",
    "@xcite measured the emission energy of ps from mesoporous films using doppler spectroscopy .",
    "this is a different technique from that used in the present study .",
    "results consistent with the one presented in this paper ( though not sample temperature dependencies ) have been obtained .",
    "in this paper , we study the ps yield and emission energy in vacuum as a function of the target temperature for two different kinds of mesoporous thin films with the same tetraethoxysilane ( teos ) mineral source for the silica network skeleton precursor : ctacl - teos and f127-teos .",
    "the density of the c sample is approximately 1.2 g/@xmath6 and of the f sample is 1.5 g/@xmath6 .",
    "both samples were spin - coated on glass similar to the ones we measured in @xcite .",
    "the c samples are prepared via a sol - gel process using cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride ( ctacl ) cationic surfactants as the organic pore generator ( porogen ) agent @xcite .",
    "a pure aqueous method is used .",
    "the ctacl / teos molar ratio for the films prepared is 0.22 . after deposition ,",
    "the ctacl - teos / glass samples are treated at 130 @xmath7c and stored in air .",
    "the f samples use non - ionic pluronic f-127 triblock copolymer ( eo@xmath8po@xmath9eo@xmath8 ) as surfactant and were prepared in the same way as described in @xcite .",
    "both samples were calcinated for 15 minutes at 450 @xmath7c in air immediately before the e@xmath10 measurements .",
    "the recorded x - ray diffraction patterns indicate no symmetry in the pore organization .",
    "the ethz slow positron beam used for these measurements is described in greater detail in @xcite .",
    "the positrons flux is 25000 e@xmath10/s .",
    "the slow positron beam is stopped in the sio@xmath2 target .",
    "the positrons can either form positronium , i.e. o - ps or p - ps , or annihilate into @xmath11 s .",
    "the detection with an mcp ( micro - channel plate ) of the secondary electrons ( se ) emitted when the positrons hit the target serves for tagging the positronium formation .",
    "the se leave the target accelerated to 1 - 11 kev by the same voltage applied to the target relative to the grounded transport tube that is used to implant the positrons in the positronium converter .",
    "the se are then transported by a magnetic field in the backward direction , as shown in figure [ traj ] .",
    "the electrons move along the magnetic field line in spirals and are deflected to the mcp region by the @xmath12 filter .",
    "the tagging efficiency varies from 70% to 30% in the energy range 1 - 10 kev .",
    "the samples are mounted on a cryocooler head to allow the possibility of varying their temperature in the range of 50 - 400 k.      the start time t@xmath13 for the detectors is triggered by the mcp detecting the se emitted when the positrons hit the target . in both pals and tof detectors",
    "the stop is given by one ( or more ) annihilation photons depositing some energy in the calorimeter ( ecal ) .",
    "both ecal are composed of bgo crystals with hexagonal shape , 61 mm external diameter and 200 mm length .",
    "the time resolution of the system mcp - ecal was measured to be around 5 ns ( fwhm ) .",
    "the typical energy resolution of the crystals is about 25 - 30@xmath14 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the ecal for the tof is placed behind a lead slit at a distance z from the target that can be varied ( as sketched in figure [ traj ] ) .",
    "the detector is screened by four half cylinders of lead surrounding the beam pipe .",
    "the thickness of the shielding is 70 mm , the width of the slit is set to 5 mm and its position with respect to the target can be adjusted . for this measurement in order to maximize the signal to background ratio the center of the slit was placed at a distance of 18 mm from the target .",
    "the main contribution to the background is given by photons coming from direct positrons and p - ps annihilations in the target ( so called prompt peak ) .",
    "some of those photons can be detected in the crystals after compton scattering in the lead shield .",
    "the determination of the slit position with respect to the target was done by scanning the slit position in 0.1 mm steps and recording the maximum of the 511 kev annihilation peak .",
    "the scans were performed 30 min after the temperature was set on the sample .",
    "this technique was very important in order to correct the slit position as a function of the temperature .",
    "in fact , at 50 k the contraction of the cryocooler head was measured to be @xmath15 mm in agreement with the prediction of finite elements calculations performed with the comsol package @xcite .",
    "the pals detector was designed to have a large acceptance to provide a uniform efficiency for detecting the ps emitted in vacuum @xcite .",
    "in order to design the detectors and interpret the data , simulations served as a powerful tool . in the monte carlo",
    "( mc ) simulations of our setup , the 3d eb - fields were calculated with the comsol multi - physics program and the positron / electron trajectories in the beam were simulated with geant4 .",
    "the simulation of the photon detection in the apparatus was based on the same package @xcite .",
    "new classes were written in order to simulate the o - ps production , propagation in the beam pipe , reflection on pipe walls that were assumed to be knudsen - like ( ps is reflected isotropically ) , pick - off effect or decay ( ps is not a standard particle in geant4 ) .",
    "the events for the o - ps@xmath16 process were generated taking into account the decay matrix element @xcite .",
    "the geometries of the beam transport pipe , photon detector , positron tagging system and its material were coded into simulations .",
    "the results were cross - checked with our experimental measurements for both photon detection @xcite and particle transport in the eb - fields @xcite .",
    "the measurements were taken in a clean vacuum of @xmath17 mbar . to avoid water contamination of the film during the cooling down ,",
    "the target was kept at room temperature for an hour using a heater before lowering its temperature .",
    "the cooling cycles were repeated and the data confirmed the reproducibility of the results . the signals from the bgo s photomultipliers are split to record both energy and timing with a charge - to - digital converter ( qdc caen v792 ) and a time - to - digital converter ( tdc caen v775 ) .",
    "a cut on the energy deposited in the bgo between @xmath18 kev was applied to optimize the signal to background ratio suppressing compton scattering events in the collimator from direct and p - ps annihilations in the target .      in this section",
    "we present the results we obtained from the pals measurements .",
    "the spectra are analyzed using the lt9 @xcite program .",
    "the lifetimes of the decay components and its fractions are resolved by fitting the pals spectra .",
    "the program finds 3 exponentials convoluted with a 5 ns fwhm resolution function of the spectrometer .",
    "the shortest exponential ( less than 4 ns ) is originated by direct positron and p - ps annihilations .",
    "it is disregarded because we are interested only in contribution of o - ps .",
    "we define as ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , and ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) the intensities and the lifetimes of the two longer exponentials . to determine the yield @xmath23 of ps emitted in vacuum and the lifetime @xmath24 in the pores of the film we used a model of ps escaping in vacuum @xcite . according to this model the lifetime @xmath24 in the pores of the film",
    "is defined as : @xmath25 the yield @xmath23 of ps emitted in vacuum was calculated according to : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the escape rate of free ps into vacuum .",
    "we extracted the films thicknesses for the two samples by fitting the total ps yield as a function of the positron implantation energy to the makhovian profile .",
    "these thicknesses are reported in table [ tbl1 ] in which we also present the values of @xmath24 and @xmath28 calculated with the expressions above .",
    "we use the results of the fits of the pals spectra at 6 kev for the c sample and 10 kev for the f sample at 50 k and 300 k. these implantation energies will serve as a reference for the rest of the paper . we choose those values in order to maximize the amount of thermalized ps . at these energies the majority of the positrons are still implanted within the films ( no significant drop of the total ps yield @xmath29 is observed , see fig .",
    "[ palsdata ] ) and the emission energy is in the constant region ( see next section ) . with @xmath24 one can calculate the effective pore size @xmath30 in the films applying the gidley et al .",
    "@xcite extension of the tau - eldrup model @xcite-@xcite ( we will call it hereafter rte model ) . as one can see , at lower temperature the lifetime in the film increases as predicted by the rte model .",
    "this can be understood in the following way : the overlap of the ps wave function with the volume contained within a distance @xmath31 nm @xcite from the walls for which the annihilation rate is assumed to increase is less for ps confined in the pores occupying the ground state than for ps in excited states .",
    "since at lower temperatures the population of the ground state is higher the pick - off rate decreases . however , the measured lifetimes are lower than what is expected by the calculations using the rte model . for the c sample the discrepancy is less than 10% but for the f sample the measured value is 30% lower suggesting that the pick - off rate increases .",
    "deviations from the rte model were already observed in previous measurements using the 2 to 3@xmath32 ratio technique @xcite and in a measurement using pals @xcite .",
    "different factors could be responsible for that as pointed out in those papers and deserves further studies .",
    "since the parameter @xmath33 of the rte model was calibrated at room temperature we use the lifetimes at 300 k to determine the effective pore size that ps experiences .",
    "we report the results at the end of the paper in table [ tbl3 ] for both rectangular channels and cubic boxes .",
    "interestingly , we found that the yield of ps emitted in vacuum can be considered as independent of the temperature of the target ( see fig .",

    "however , our measurements indicate that the escape rate in vacuum is smaller at lower temperature ( see table [ tbl1 ] ) , explaining the observation that the yield is constant .",
    "a possible explanation of this effect can be found considering that ps tunnels from one pore to the other . in this case , the tunneling probability will decrease with temperature explaining our measurements .",

[ components ] ) . to estimate these non - thermalized contributions , we suppose that the shape of their distribution , nt(t ) , is represented by the tof spectrum obtained at a low implantation energy . to select the implantation energy ( from the ones we had measured ) and the scaling factor of nt(t ) for the subtraction , we relied on the mc .",
    "we used the values for which the best fit between the mc and the spectra obtained after the subtraction of nt(t ) was achieved ( for more details see @xcite ) .",

    "[ mc ] , a satisfactory agreement between the data and the mc ( adding the spectra at 2 kev that takes into account the non - thermalized ps ) is achieved .",
    "we attribute the difference between 40 and 100 ns to the approximation used in the subtraction method where the contribution of the non - thermalized ps is underestimated since only a spectrum of a defined energy is used for this correction .",

    "our results are in fair agreement with a model of ps confined in rectangular channels in thermal equilibrium with the sample .",
    "the measured minimal energy for the c sample was found to be 73@xmath415 mev while for the f sample it is 48@xmath415 mev .",
    "these experimental results provide a solid ground to understand how to produce ps at lower temperature and could serve to develop a more realistic model to interpret the data .",
