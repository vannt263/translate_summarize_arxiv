    "in particle physics there is a number of well - established principles ( four - dimensional lorentz invariance , renormalizability , gauge symmetries , etc . ) , which are believed to underlie a consistent quantum field theory .",
    "all these principles are built into the standard model ( sm ) and its great experimental success is a major justification for their validity .",
    "however , in continuing search for the consistent description of an emerging physics beyond the standard model , one often tries to ease some of these criteria .",
    "it is then important to make sure that such modifications do not contradict to the observable data , as well as to find observable signatures of a new model .    since 1950s  @xcite , one uses the gauge symmetry as a main principle for constructing interactions between elementary particles .",
    "it is known , however , that in theories with chiral couplings ( i.e. when left and right - handed fermions have different charges with respect to a gauge group ) , one may encounter a situation when the classically conserved gauge current acquires an anomalous divergence at one loop .",
    "it is known that such anomalies destroy consistency of the theory , making it non - unitary  @xcite .",
    "meson into two @xmath0-quanta ( famous abj - anomaly  @xcite ) , the baryon and lepton number non - conservation in electroweak theory  @xcite , and proton decay in the presence of magnetic monopole  @xcite . ] in the standard model , where the couplings of fermions are chiral , charges of all particles can be chosen to ensure the absence of all gauge anomalies  @xcite .",
    "it may happen , however , that anomaly - free theory looks like an anomalous one below certain energy scale .",
    "an example of such a theory would be an electroweak theory at the energy scale below the mass of top - quark . then anomaly is canceled by means of wess - zumino like terms  @xcite .    among many possible extensions of the standard model",
    "there are theories with extra dimensions .",
    "their main idea is that our 4-dimensional physics is embedded into a theory in a higher - dimensional space .",
    "the standard model fields are then realized as zero modes of a higher - dimensional ones .",
    "( an example is given by an approach , often dubbed _",
    "brane - world _ models , where zero modes of both matter and gauge fields are localized on the 4-dimensional defect , called _ brane _  @xcite ) .",
    "once our 4-dimensional world is just a low - energy sector of a bigger theory , the anomaly analysis changes drastically .",
    "for example , if a full theory is anomaly free ( say , it is formulated in an odd number of space - time dimensions , where all interactions are vector - like ) , then one has no reason to expect separate anomaly cancellation for the brane fields ( for an explicit example of a brane - world theory with an anomaly on the brane , see  @xcite ) .",
    "if the theory on the brane is anomalous , then there is a specific type of _ brane - bulk interaction_. it is described by chern - simons - like terms in the low - energy effective action in the bulk .",
    "these terms are not gauge invariant in the presence of a brane .",
    "therefore , they generate currents , flowing to the brane and thus ensuring the gauge invariance of the full theory . such mechanism is known for a long time and is often called _ anomaly inflow _",
    "it is quite general and appears in many ( physically very distinct ) problems : in quantum hall effect  @xcite , dimensional `` brane '' , embedded into @xmath1 dimensional bulk .",
    "effective theory in the bulk is described by the @xmath2 chern - simons theory , while on the boundary chiral excitations are localized .",
    "conformal field theory describing these excitations was first derived from anomaly consideration  @xcite . ] in various field theories with solitonic objects in them ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , in string and m - theory  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the brane - world models a number of questions arises :    1 .",
    "[ item:1 ] can one distinguish between a purely 4-dimensional anomaly - free theory , and a theory ( also anomaly - free ! ) in which anomaly is canceled by a small inflow from extra dimensions ? what new observable effects appear in the latter situation ? 2 .",
    "[ item:4 ] is it possible to discriminate at low - energies between two different completions of anomalous 4-dimensional effective theory : the one , where anomaly is canceled by inflow from higher dimensions and purely 4-dimensional one , where at higher energies there exist additional particles , which ensure anomaly cancellation ( c.f .",
    "[ item:2 ] for generic values of hypercharges the minimal standard model is anomalous .",
    "however , for any hypercharges , electrodynamics is still vector - like .",
    "can this anomaly nevertheless be observed if this anomalous theory is embedded into a consistent higher - dimensional one ?",
    "[ item:3 ] what are experimental constraints for the parameters describing anomaly mismatch ?",
    "can the above observations serve as tests in the search for extra dimensions ?    in this paper we will attempt to answer the questions  [ item:1][item:2 ]",
    ". the question  [ item:3 ] will be addressed in our next paper  @xcite .",
    "we would like to note also that in this paper ( as well as in the subsequent paper  @xcite ) we study only gauge anomalies .",
    "the global chiral anomalies in brane - worlds and corresponding complicated vacuum structure of gauge fields has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we consider a theory on a brane , which is anomalous , while the bulk effective action possesses a chern - simons - like term , responsible for an inflow current . a naive answer to the question  ( [ item:1 ] ) then would seem to be the following : as anomaly means gauge current non - conservation , one could expect that particles escape from the brane to extra dimensions .",
    "this would look like a loss of unitarity from a purely 4-dimensional point of view , however higher - dimensional unitarity would still be preserved .",
    "anomalous current then is simply a flow of such zero - mode particles into the bulk .",
    "however , this answer is incorrect .",
    "indeed , phenomenologically acceptable brane - world scenario must have a mass gap between zero modes and those in the bulk for both fermions and non - abelian gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the rate of escape of the matter from a brane must be suppressed in some way ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "the low - energy processes on the brane simply can not create an excitation , propagating in the bulk . if no matter can escape the brane ( or flow onto it )",
    " what is then an inflow current , which should be non - zero even for weak fields causing anomaly in four - dimensional theory ?",
    "one seems to be presented with a paradox .",
    "we show that in reality the inflow current by its nature is a _ vacuum _ or _ non - dissipative _ current .",
    "what we mean by that is the following . usually in electrodynamics one needs to create particles from a vacuum to generate an electric current .",
    "such a process is only possible if the available energy is larger than the mass of the particles in the bulk .",
    "therefore , weak electric fields on the brane can not induce a current , carried by the bulk modes .",
    "however , anomaly inflow current is different .",
    "first , it is perpendicular to the field , does not perform a work and thus is not suppressed by the mass of a particle in the bulk .",
    "second , such a current is not carried by any real particles excited from the vacuum , being rather a collective effect , resulting from a rearrangement of the dirac sea .",
    "this simple observation is in fact very important .",
    "essentially , it means that anomaly inflow is a very special type of brane - bulk interaction .",
    "namely , we show that in the presence of parallel magnetic and electric fields the latter changes as if photon had acquired mass . as a result",
    "the spatial distribution of an electric field changes , in particular it appears outside the plates of the capacitor .",
    "similarly , an electric field of an point - like electric charge changes from coulomb to yukawa , when the charge is placed in a magnetic field .",
    "the dynamics of the screening of electric charge happens to be quite peculiar and can be shown to lead to the temporary appearance of _ dipole moment _ of elementary particles .    at first",
    ", we conduct our analysis in @xmath2 gauge theory with the chiral couplings to a matter .",
    "one example of such a theory would be an electrodynamics , where left and right - handed particles have different electric charges .",
    "the masses of such particles can then be generated only via the higgs mechanism with a charged higgs field , which means that a photon in such a theory becomes massive .",
    "a different example is a theory , where axial current comes from a neutrino with a small electric charge .",
    "in such theory photon would remain massless .",
    "then we analyze the version of the standard model where electric charges of electron and proton differ .",
    "we show that although low - energy electrodynamics in this theory is vector - like , there exist effects , similar to those , described above .",
    "we would like to stress again that in the theories with extra dimensions there is no immediate reason to expect that four - dimensional anomaly is so small as it follows already from present experimental constraints on the corresponding parameters .",
    "the effects which would follow from the existence of an anomaly inflow are observable , but quite peculiar .",
    "they do not change drastically physical content of the theory and can be ruled out or constrained only experimentally .",
    "thus in those brane - world scenarios , in which _ higher - dimensional _ theory is automatically anomaly free , we are facing yet another fine - tuning puzzle .    for distinctness we will often refer to a simple brane - world : the fermions in the background of a kink , realizing a 4-dimensional brane , embedded into a 5-dimensional space as in  @xcite ( although main effects are believed to be model - independent ) .",
    "we localize gauge fields in a spirit of  @xcite , introducing an exponential warp - factor .",
    "such warp - factor can arise dynamically because of the fermionic zero modes  @xcite .",
    "zero modes of both types of fields are separated by mass gaps from the corresponding bulk modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin section  [ sec : qed ] with describing a model of chiral electrodynamics , embedded into a 5-dimensional @xmath2 theory and analyze the microscopic structure of the inflow and details of anomaly cancellation .",
    "next , we turn in section  [ sec : anom - sm ] to the question of possible extensions of the standard model , such that it would admit an anomaly .",
    "we consider one - parameter family of such modifications , with the free parameter being the difference of ( absolute values of ) electric charges of proton and electron . in such model particles",
    "also acquire an anomalous dipole moment .",
    "we discuss it in the section  [ sec : proton ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of future extensions of this work and some speculations .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that in this paper we conducted analysis on the level of classical equations of motion .",
    "we discuss some aspects of quantum theory and the validity of our approach in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we start our analysis considering in this section the simplest model which nevertheless catches main effects we are interested in .",
    "namely , we will discuss a four - dimensional @xmath2 theory with anomalous chiral couplings to the fermions .",
    "such a theory suffers from a gauge anomaly , meaning that on the quantum level its unitarity is lost  @xcite .",
    "thus it can not describe physics of a 4-dimensional world .",
    "however , if one thinks about such an anomalous theory as living on a brane , embedded in a 5-dimensional theory , situation changes .",
    "five - dimensional theory is anomaly - free ( all couplings there are vector - like ) and therefore there should exist a special type of interaction ( _ anomaly inflow _",
    "@xcite ) between the theories on the brane and in the bulk , which ensures the unitarity and consistency of the total system . below",
    "we demonstrate this mechanism in details .",
    "for definiteness we will illustrate our steps by using a concrete model of localization of both fermions and gauge fields .",
    "consider the following theory : , greek @xmath3 .",
    "we are using _ mostly negative _ metric .",
    "our brane is stretched in @xmath4 directions and is located at @xmath5 .",
    "we will often use notations @xmath6 instead of @xmath7 and choose polar coordinates @xmath8 in the plane @xmath9.[fn:1 ] ] @xmath10 here @xmath11 is a five - dimensional charge , with the dimensionality of @xmath12 .",
    "there are two fermions @xmath13 , interacting with the gauge fields with the different charges : @xmath14 .",
    "the fermionic mass terms @xmath15 have a `` kink - like '' structure in the direction @xmath16 , realizing the brane : @xmath17 . as it is well - known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ,",
    "in this model one has chiral fermion zero modes localized on the brane and a continuous spectrum in the bulk , separated from the zero mode by the mass gap @xmath18 .",
    "localization of the zero mode of gauge field is achieved by introduction of a warp - factor @xmath19 .",
    "whenever @xmath20 is convergent the system has a zero mode with the constant profile in the 5th direction .",
    "warp - factor @xmath19 looks like an @xmath16 dependent coupling constant in the action  ( [ eq:1 ] ) , getting infinite as @xmath21 .",
    "the lattice study of  @xcite has confirmed that the perturbative and non - perturbative analysis of ( [ eq:1 ] ) give the same result for the zero mode up to the energies of the order of the mass gap , at least for @xmath22 reduction .",
    "we will assume that this is the case for @xmath23 .",
    "depending on the warp - factor , the spectrum of gauge field may be discrete or continuous with or without the mass gap between the zero and bulk modes  @xcite .",
    "we will often use @xmath24 in which case the zero mode is separated from the bulk continuum by the mass gap @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the nature of the warp - factor @xmath19 is not essential here , it can originate from that of the metric or can arise dynamically , coming from fermionic zero modes  @xcite .",
    "a low - energy effective action for the gauge fields of the theory  ( [ eq:1 ] ) will contain terms , describing interaction between the brane and the bulk : @xmath26 the origin of two last terms is the following .",
    "the computation of the fermionic path integral of our theory is separated into the determinant of the 5-dimensional bulk modes of the fermions and that of the 4-dimensional chiral fermionic zero modes . in the former case",
    "one can show ( essentially repeating the computations of  @xcite ) , that after integrating out the non - zero modes of the fermions , the 5-dimensional effective action of the model  ( [ eq:1 ] ) acquires an additional contribution of chern - simons type @xmath27 compared to the usual case  @xcite , chern - simons term in models like  ( [ eq:1 ] ) acquires additional factor @xmath28 .",
    "it is proportional to the difference of the charges of the five - dimensional fermions and depends on the profile of the domain wall . in the limit of an infinitely thin wall and the large fermionic mass gap @xmath29 .",
    "below we sketch the derivation of this function .    terms like   generically appear in the theories with anomaly inflow  @xcite . in situations with more than one extra dimension",
    "an effective action will have similar structure , with the fifth coordinate being suitably chosen radial coordinate .",
    "such terms can also appear for non - abelian fields .",
    "evaluating of the determinant of the 4-dimensional dirac operator in the background of the gauge field ( and , possibly , higgs field , see below ) , we get @xmath30 .",
    "let us denote the _",
    "4-dimensional _ charges of the left and right - handed fermionic zero modes as @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "they are proportional to their 5-dimensional counterparts @xmath33 and @xmath34 and thus @xmath35 .",
    "as a result @xmath30 is _ not gauge invariant_. the manifestation of this fact is the anomalous divergence of the gauge current at one - loop level : @xmath36 the action  ( [ eq:3 ] ) is also non - gauge invariant , and the variations of these two terms cancel each other ( as we will demonstrate below ) .",
    "divergence of the current  ( [ eq:5 ] ) is proportional to the transversal profile of the fermion zero modes . in this paper",
    "we will be interested in the characteristic energy scales much less than the mass gap of the gauge fields @xmath25 , which is in turn much less than the fermionic mass gap : @xmath37 .",
    "therefore the profile of the fermion zero mode can be approximated by the delta - function @xmath38 , which appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "equations of motion coming from the action  ( [ eq:2 ] ) are : @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the right hand side of eq .  ( [ eq:6 ] )",
    "there is a current of the zero modes @xmath41 ( we will omit brackets @xmath42 from now on ) .",
    "the variation of the effective action @xmath30 with respect to the @xmath43 is equal to zero .. zero modes of @xmath44 and @xmath45 have definite 4-dimensional chirality . therefore @xmath46 and analogously for @xmath45 . ]    the current @xmath47 in the right hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:6])([eq:7 ] ) is defined via @xmath48 note that in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) there is a term , proportional to the derivative of @xmath28 .",
    "this term is non - zero only in the vicinity of the brane ( as @xmath49 is proportional to the delta - function of @xmath16 ) .",
    "thus , essentially it corresponds to the modification of definition of the brane current @xmath50  ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "this additional term is responsible for making anomaly of the zero modes _ gauge invariant _",
    "@xcite , as the inflow current  ( [ eq:5 ] ) is always gauge invariant in the @xmath2 case .",
    "thus , terms proportional to @xmath49 correspond to the local counterterms , shifting between the _ covariant _ and _ consistent _ anomalies  @xcite . in what follows we will always consider covariant anomaly of the brane modes and ignore terms in the bulk , proportional to the @xmath49 .",
    "the chern - simons current @xmath51 is a non - dissipative one as it does not perform a work due to its antisymmetric structure .",
    "in addition to that it does not depend on the mass of the fermions in the bulk and hence is not suppressed by the mass gap .",
    "if a gauge field has four - dimensional components with @xmath52 , there exists a current @xmath53 , flowing onto the brane from the extra dimension  @xcite .",
    "trivial consequence of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:6])([eq:7 ] ) is @xmath54 it means that if coefficients in front of the @xmath55 and @xmath30 were not correlated , by virtue of  ( [ eq:5 ] ) the solutions of eq .",
    "would be field configurations with @xmath56 .",
    "however , to preserve the gauge - invariance in the action   the divergences of currents in the left hand side of   should be equal . from the definition  ( [ eq:8 ] )",
    "one can see that @xmath57 comparing  ( [ eq:10 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) we can choose the coefficient of @xmath58 of the function @xmath28 so that the current @xmath47 cancels the anomalous divergence of the current @xmath41 and make the theory  ( [ eq:2 ] ) consistent and gauge - invariant .",
    "namely @xmath59 microscopical calculations of @xmath28 confirm that this is indeed the case .    the relation between 5-dimensional fields @xmath60 , entering eqs .",
    "( [ eq:6])([eq:7 ] ) and the 4-dimensional ones is given by : @xmath61 here @xmath62 is a _ four - dimensional @xmath2 coupling constant _ , related to the 5-dimensional one via @xmath63 ( to see that , one should substitute @xmath60 , independent on the 5th coordinate , into the kinetic term in  ( [ eq:2 ] ) and integrate over @xmath16 ) .",
    "field @xmath64 satisfies the 4-dimensional maxwell equations @xmath65 with the current in the right hand side given by : @xmath66 this current is conserved : @xmath67 as a consequence of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) and  ( [ eq:9 ] ) .        in the theory  ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "fermionic zero modes on the brane are massless . to make this model more realistic",
    ", we should add mass to these zero modes as well .",
    "the only way to make the electro - dynamics anomalous is to take left and right moving fermions with different electric charges .",
    "thus one can only introduce a mass term via the higgs mechanism with an electrically charged higgs field , i.e. to add the following term to the bulk lagrangian  ( [ eq:1 ] ) : @xmath68\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and the higgs mass @xmath70 is negative at @xmath71 and tends to the positive constant in the bulk , as @xmath72 ( figure  [ fig : higgs ] ) .",
    "thus higgs field has a non - trivial profile @xmath73 , with @xmath74 and @xmath75 at @xmath76 .",
    "so the symmetry is restored far from the domain wall .",
    "the higgs mass far from the brane is taken to be large , so that the scalar is localized on a brane .",
    "the higgs field has an expectation value , which on the brane is @xmath77 ( we take the scalar s self - coupling @xmath78 to be large , so that higgs mass @xmath79 is much bigger than @xmath80  yukawa mass of the fermions on the brane ) .",
    "as the higgs field is charged , the photon should acquire mass for @xmath81 ) . to determine it exactly one needs to find the spectrum of the theory with action given by the sum of  ( [ eq:1 ] ) and  ( [ eq:16 ] ) ,",
    "but for us it is only important that @xmath82 , where parameter @xmath58 was defined in  ( [ eq:11 ] ) . in section  [ sec : anom - sm ] we will analyze the consequences of anomaly inflow in the standard model , where yukawa mass of the fermions does not necessarily lead to the massive photon .",
    "dynamics of the higgs field @xmath83 simplifies in the limit of the large ( compared to the energy scale of the processes on the brane ) vev @xmath84 . in this limit",
    "it is convenient to work in the _ unitary gauge _ , in which the phase of the higgs field is fixed ( e.g. via @xmath85 ) . in the regions of space where the gauge field has non - trivial @xmath60",
    ", it is impossible to have @xmath86  @xcite .",
    "however , variations of the @xmath87 are suppressed by the higgs s vev , we can neglect them and take @xmath88 on the brane .",
    "now the vector field is massive and longitudinal component becomes a physical degree of freedom . from equations of motion one can obtain the following condition on the field @xmath89 : @xmath90 eq .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) is just an expression of the gauge invariance of the total action .",
    "divergences of @xmath91 and @xmath47 precisely cancel each other  ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) implies that @xmath92 once we have added the mass to the zero mode fermions , we can integrate them out and obtain effective action @xmath30  ( [ eq:2 ] ) , written in unitary gauge .",
    "the variation of this action with respect to @xmath93 gives gauge invariant current  @xcite : @xmath94 we will often call this current _ the dhoker - farhi current _ denote it @xmath95 . in the unitary gauge eq .",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) becomes @xmath96 this current has a divergence , equal to that of the chern - simons current ( @xmath97 ) : @xmath98    a purpose of this work is to explore in details this anomaly cancellation mechanism .",
    "namely , _ what constitutes the inflow _",
    "? zero modes of fermions are confined to the brane and can not propagate in the bulk , while bulk modes are massive and can not be excited at low energies .",
    "another question is _ whether 4-dimensional observer can distinguish _ between an anomaly - free , intrinsically 4-dimensional theory and 5-dimensional ( anomaly - free ! ) brane - world theory , in which a very small anomaly of the 4-dimensional fermions on the brane is canceled by an inflow from the bulk .",
    "as we have seen , on the microscopic level anomaly inflow is a collective effect of reorganization of the dirac see of the massive fermions in the bulk in the presence of a field configuration with non - zero @xmath99 .",
    "the simplest way to obtain non - zero @xmath100 is to choose both @xmath101 and @xmath102 to be parallel to each other and constant ( in @xmath103 ) in some region on the brane .",
    "we realize such fields by two parallel infinite plates in the vacuum , separated in the direction @xmath104 by the distance @xmath105  a capacitor with initial charge densities @xmath106 on plates , placed in the magnetic field .",
    "magnetic field is created by an ( infinite in the @xmath107-direction ) solenoid with the radius @xmath108 .",
    "before these fields are turned on , the vacuum structure on the classical level is unchanged and there is no difference with non - anomalous theory . also , the effects of anomaly are controlled by the parameter @xmath58 , which is naturally assumed to be very small .",
    "that is why the most natural setup to study the anomaly inflow is qualitatively the following .",
    "we assume that the vacuum current is zero and an electric field is equal to its value for non - anomalous theory .",
    "then we turn on a parallel magnetic field and expect that small ( perturbative in @xmath58 ) inflow currents start to change the charge distribution on the brane trying to compensate the anomalous field configuration . according to this picture , in section  [ sec : perturb ] we will choose initial condition describing the absence of anomalous vacuum structure and will consider an initial stage of inflow ( linear in time ) perturbatively , in the first order in @xmath58 .",
    "we will see , however , that this naive approach does not work and perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "therefore , we will have to study the full non - linear equations non - perturbatively in @xmath58 . then , as we will show in section  [ sec : final - state ] , a non - analytic in @xmath58 static solution exists .",
    "the properties of this solution will define the main observable effect of the anomaly inflow , studied in the present paper .",
    "it is , nevertheless , instructive to study the dynamical problem to understand qualitatively how this state is formed . as we will see in section  [ sec : old - part ] , from the 4-dimensional point of view the picture of the inflow given by perturbation theory is qualitatively correct and knowing the non - perturbative static solution one can define it properly .      as in general",
    "we expect the parameter @xmath58 to be extremely small , we will try to solve the maxwell equations  ( [ eq:6])([eq:7 ] ) by perturbation theory in @xmath58 . to find linear in time corrections to the fields at @xmath109 , we should specify the initial values of all fields .",

    "( [ eq:8 ] ) and  ( [ eq:20 ] ) correspondingly ) . because we have added a charged higgs field  ( [ eq:16 ] ) and",
    "the electrodynamics became massive , specifying initial values of @xmath115 is not enough and one should also set values of the gauge potential at @xmath109 .",
    "we choose all but @xmath116 components @xmath117 initially equal to zero ( see appendix  [ app : linear ] for details ) .",
    "the time derivatives of @xmath117 can then be extracted knowing electric fields at @xmath109 and using condition  ( [ eq:18 ] ) . in this paper",
    "we restrict our analysis only to such initial conditions . in general initial conditions on the vector field @xmath117",
    "will depend on how one turns on electric and magnetic fields .",
    "corresponding analysis ( similar to that of  @xcite ) will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in addition to these initial condition we will choose as a zeroth approximation such configuration of electromagnetic fields @xmath115 that @xmath118 .",
    "the reason for that is as follows : from  ( [ eq:8 ] ) one has @xmath119 . in the absence of anomaly @xmath120 would be equal to zero for our configuration of charges .",
    "therefore , it is natural to assume that initially @xmath120 is equal to zero in the full theory as well .",

    "the same is true for a point - like charge , placed in magnetic field  ( [ eq:58 ] ) . in particular , the electric field , created by an infinite capacitor ,",
    "appears outside its plates ( eq .  ( [ eq:57 ] ) ) .",
    "as we will argue in our next paper  @xcite , this effect can be used as a signature of extra dimensions .",
    "although we have already obtained a non - perturbative final state , we would still like to see how this solution is formed .",
    "therefore let us come back to the dynamical problem .",
    "although the naive perturbation theory did not work , the parameter @xmath58 is very small , and it is natural to assume that if we will choose a more appropriate zeroth approximation , we can describe time - dependent effects of initial stage of anomaly inflow perturbatively .",
    "part of the wave - function @xmath209 plus perturbative series in @xmath210 in a pre - exponential term . ] the results of the previous section explain why the naive perturbation theory of section  [ sec : perturb ] did not work .",
    "essentially , this is due to the fact that the solution in the bulk is non - perturbative in @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , we will try to find a dynamic solution ( linear in time ) , based on the non - perturbative zeroth approximation , derived from the static solution  ( [ eq:51 ] ) .    at first sight solution  ( [ eq:51 ] )",
    "differs drastically from electric fields of section  [ sec : perturb ] .",
    "for example , the component @xmath211 and a charge density distribution are symmetric with respect to an inversion @xmath212 , while the correction @xmath136 to an electric field is anti - symmetric .",
    "this is due to the fact that the full ( time - dependent ) maxwell equations do not possess such symmetry ( unlike the equations for the static case ) .",
    "thus , for example , the point particle can have a ( time - dependent ) dipole moment at initial stage of anomaly inflow ( see below , section  [ sec : dipole - moment ] ) , while such a dipole moment will be absent in the static solution  ( [ eq:58 ] ) .",
    "additionally , static solution behaves as @xmath213 for @xmath214 outside the region  ( [ eq:53 ] ) around the brane , which is very different from the @xmath133 dependence of the fields @xmath138 and @xmath215 in section  [ sec : perturb ] , which had a power law decay ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we can still develop a perturbative ( in time ) expansions for electric fields . as a zeroth approximation we will take functions @xmath138 and @xmath215 , whose profiles in @xmath133 direction is @xmath178 and @xmath216 correspondingly ( that is they go to zero exponentially fast for @xmath217 ) , unlike functions @xmath138 and @xmath215 in the section  [ sec : perturb ] ) .",

    "we stress that @xmath218 is just an auxiliary function , which is not related to the component @xmath222 of the gauge field . the initial field @xmath223 is created by an infinite capacitor in @xmath224 dimensions .",
    "the reason for such a choice is the following .",
    "the relaxation time in the bulk is determined by the mass of the fermions there ( fermionic mass gap ) .",
    "this mass is much larger than any other scale in our theory , therefore one can think that the bulk fermions form an incompressible fluid and have a relaxation time @xmath225 much faster than any time scale in the theory .",
    "therefore the profile in @xmath133 direction settles over the time of turning on of a magnetic fields .",
    "as the magnetic field @xmath132 is already taken at its stationary value in our problem , we also take static profile in @xmath133-direction for the electric fields . on the contrary ,",
    "the relaxation in @xmath107-direction is of the order @xmath226 , which is incomparably smaller than the afore - mentioned scale .",
    "the difference of these two scales justifies an ansatz  ( [ eq:59 ] ) .",
    "we will find corrections to the electric field  ( [ eq:59 ] ) for the times @xmath227 .",
    "the resulting expression has @xmath133 dependence of the form @xmath228 ( see appendix  [ app : correct ] for details ) .",
    "thus , it will decay in the same region , as a full solution and a problems of the perturbation theory of the section  [ sec : perturb ] are removed .    in the linear stage the result of the anomaly inflow",
    "is the following .",
    "the anomalous electric density appears between the plates of the capacitor : @xmath229 where @xmath171 is the value of magnetic field @xmath230 in the center of the solenoid .",
    "this means that the _ capacitor acquires anomalous electric charge , linearly changing with time_. this implies an existence of the stationary 4-dimensional current @xmath231 , given by @xmath232 ( where @xmath222 is given by  ( [ eq:59 ] ) ) .",
    "this picture has an apparent contradiction with causality , as a non - zero current @xmath233 instantaneously appears at spatial infinity at @xmath109 .",
    "this is due to our choice of initial conditions : the magnetic field @xmath234 was turned on instantaneously in the whole space . in reality",
    "there is a transitional period , depending on the speed with which we are turning on magnetic field , and the current will appear at infinity only when magnetic field will reach it .",
    "we see that in accord with our qualitative expectations , electric charge is initially accumulating in the region of space where initial @xmath235 .",
    "such a charge of course creates an electric field outside the plates of the capacitor . for @xmath236 and @xmath237 the electric field outside of",
    "the capacitor behaves as @xmath238 comparing correction @xmath239 with @xmath202 , we see that the linear stage of anomaly inflow is valid for the time @xmath240 where @xmath241      we discussed in section  [ sec : observ - inflow ] the simplest possible way to create configuration of electro - magnetic field with parallel @xmath101 and @xmath102 and therefore observe effects of anomaly inflow .",
    "actually , the electro - magnetic field created by any charged particles with spin has non - zero @xmath242 .",
    "as we will presently see , anomaly inflow in this case leads to an appearance of an anomalous dipole moment of the particle . to estimate this effect , we start from the quasi - classical expressions for electric and magnetic fields , created by a particle with an electric charge @xmath62 and magnetic moment @xmath243 @xmath244 thus , in the region of the space where expression  ( [ eq:77 ] ) is non - zero , inflow current ( analogous to that of section  [ sec : observ - inflow ] ) creates non - zero anomalous charge density @xmath245",
    ". such density will be positive in one half of the ball , surrounding a particle , and negative in another one . as a result ,",
    "the total charge of the particle does not change .",
    "however due to the inflow any particle acquires an anomalous _ electric dipole moment _ : @xmath246 ( here @xmath247 is a compton radius of the particle , given by @xmath248 in our system of units ) .",

    "substituting all these values into eq .",
    "( [ eq:78 ] ) we get : @xmath251 i.e. as a consequence of anomaly inflow a particle acquires a dipole moment , which has the absolute value growing with time .",

    "it is valid for @xmath252 where @xmath170 is given by an analog of formula  ( [ eq:49 ] ) for @xmath253 : @xmath254 for times , much bigger that this characteristic time , field configuration around the particle approaches static solution . as it has already been discussed ( see the beginning of the section  [ sec : old - part ] ) , static equations are symmetric with respect to inversion @xmath255 , therefore , there can not be any dipole moment for @xmath256 .",
    "electric field configuration will be significantly modified from the usual coulomb to yukawa form ( similar to  ( [ eq:58 ] ) ) at the distances larger than @xmath188 , with @xmath170 given by  ( [ eq:98 ] ) .",
    "this means that the electric charge of the particle _ gets completely screened _ and the total amount of an anomalous charge which appeared on the brane is equal to the charge of the particle .",
    "in this section we apply the logic of section  [ sec : qed ] to the standard model . indeed ,",
    "if the standard model fields are localized on a brane in a 5-dimensional world , there is no apparent reason to expect a separate anomaly cancellation for them .",
