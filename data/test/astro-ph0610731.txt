    "it is now firmly established that the majority of matter in the universe is non - baryonic .",
    "evidence for this standard cosmology includes the microwave background anisotropies @xcite and the power spectrum of density fluctuations on galactic scales @xcite .",
    "the `` dark matter '' is of unknown composition , but indirect evidence from particle physics and cosmology indicates that it is likely to consist of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) in the mass range 30 gev to 3 tev .",
    "such particles would be expected to annihilate slowly in galactic halos . in most wimp models , a large fraction of the annihilation radiation",
    "is expected to be gamma rays from the decays of the @xmath0 meson , produced copiously in any energetic interaction involving hadrons .    in the cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "paradigm @xcite , it is well known that structure forms hierarchically : the dark halos of galaxies such as the milky way are expected to contain large numbers of sub - halos . for wimps , the sub - halo mass spectrum is expected to extend down to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the substructure is expected to be nearly isotropic , thus annihilation in the sub - halos can be away from the galactic plane , where astrophysical sources are concentrated .",
    "the brightest source of wimp annihilation radiation is expected to be the galactic center ( gc ) , where the wimps are most concentrated .",
    "the hess collaboration has concluded that dark matter annihilation radiation is at most a small fraction of the emission coming from the gc above 100 gev @xcite .",
    "the magic collaboration has confirmed these results @xcite . to explain these data in terms of dark matter annihilation , wimps of order 10 tev mass would be required .",
    "we will proceed with the plausible assumption that the gc emission is predominantly astrophysical .",
    "in fact it has been shown that there is only a narrow window in which dark matter annihilation could be discovered at the gc , given the hess source and its extrapolation below 100 gev @xcite .",
    "this emphasizes the point that galactic satellites may be the most promising sources of wimp annihilation radiation .",
    "many authors have discussed the possibility of annihilations in galactic substructure @xcite ; in this letter , we will illustrate that wimp annihilation sources are distinguishable from all known ( observed ) astrophysical source classes .",
    "the detection of a steady , extended high latitude source with a wimp annihilation spectrum ( e.g.  by the glast satellite ) would provide strong evidence that the dark matter in the galaxy actually consists of particles in the 100 gev mass range , a crucial piece of the dark matter puzzle .",
    "collisions of relativistic hadrons , such as when cosmic ray protons impinge on the interstellar medium ( ism ) , are typically inelastic . energy is lost mostly to @xmath2 mesons , in roughly equal numbers .",
    "the decays of the @xmath0 mesons dominate the gamma rays from hadronic interactions .",
    "the @xmath0 has a mass @xmath3 mev , and it has two common decay modes : @xmath4 ( 98.8% ) and @xmath5 ( 1.2% ) with rare modes contributing less than 0.01% . as a pseudoscalar particle , it decays isotropically .",
    "the photons emitted in @xmath6 have energies of @xmath7 mev in the @xmath0 rest frame . in the lab frame , the energies are @xmath8 .",
    "the isotropy of the decay implies that @xmath9 is uniformly distributed , and thus the spectrum @xmath10 is constant between the minimum and maximum energies @xmath11 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath12 is symmetric about @xmath13 , because @xmath14 .",
    "the observed spectrum from a source will have this property if the pion distribution is isotropic , true for both wimp annihilation and cosmic ray interactions .",
    "the photon spectrum from a single pion energy must be convolved with the pion spectrum .",
    "we consider the process @xmath15 , the annihilations of pairs of self - conjugate dark matter particles to pairs of @xmath16 quarks .",
    "the process is non - relativistic , giving monochromatic quarks with energy @xmath17 .",
    "the quarks each form `` jets '' dominated by @xmath18 mesons . in figure  [ fig : fullspectrum ] we plot the photon spectra from annihilations as calculated by darksusy @xcite , which uses results from pythia @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is universal : even @xmath19 gives similar results .",
    "only the @xmath20 channel differs appreciably @xcite , but this is difficult to arrange for wimps from supersymmetry .    in figure  [",
    "fig : fullspectrum ] we show the photon spectra from several power - law proton sources as calculated by galprop @xcite .",
    "this illustrates that the power - law proton beams typical of astrophysical sources can _ not _ easily mimic the gamma ray spectrum from wimp annihilations .",
    "the glast satellite @xcite is well suited to measuring gamma rays from dark matter annihilations .",
    "it has an effective area of @xmath211 m@xmath22 , a solid angle acceptance of @xmath23 sr , and a point spread function ( psf ) of 0.4@xmath24 at 1 gev energy .",
    "it will measure gamma ray energies between 20 mev and 300 gev .",
    "most data will be taken in survey mode , mapping the sky with equal coverage with a large duty cycle .",
    "the exposure to any source will reach roughly @xmath25 cm@xmath22 s in a 5 year mission .",
    "we have estimated the number of milky way dark matter satellites observable by glast .",
    "the calculation was performed with the semi - analytic method of  @xcite .",
    "the satellite mass distribution has the expected @xmath27 @xcite , cutting off below @xmath28 due to computational limitations .",
    "the spatial distribution of satellites is roughly spherically symmetric about the galactic center and extends well beyond the solar orbit , thus the dark matter satellites are located mostly out of the galactic plane .",
    "individual sources have nfw density profiles @xcite , with central @xmath29 cusps",
    ". satellites with steeper profiles , e.g.  @xcite , would be easier to detect .",
    "we find that the brightest sources have masses in the @xmath30 range .",
    "these brightest sources have tidal radii of order 100 pc , typically corresponding to @xmath31 on the sky .",
    "we note that most of these objects are severely stripped .",
    "they have scale radii @xmath32 much larger than their tidal truncation radii @xmath33 , thus they have nearly pure @xmath29 density profiles out to @xmath34 .",
    "the surface brightness in gamma rays is proportional to the parameter @xmath35 @xcite . for a stripped nfw clump , at a fixed angular distance from its center , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the distance .",
    "if the mass spectrum of clumps is @xmath38 and the tidal radius @xmath39 , the surface brightness of the nearest clump ( @xmath40 ) is @xmath41 .",
    "our simulations indicate that @xmath42 and @xmath43 , thus @xmath44 .",
    "lower mass clumps are brighter , but they appear smaller ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "less massive clumps would be seen as point sources .",
    "these results are sensitive to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , thus extrapolations are difficult .    as a fiducial case , we assume a wimp mass of 100 gev and an annihilation cross - section to @xmath48 of @xmath49 @xmath50 s@xmath51 , giving 14.2 photons per annihilation above 1 gev . assuming a 5 year glast mission , and integrating a @xmath31 radius around the source , the number of background counts is 375 ( based on the egret extragalactic background @xcite ) .",
    "the typical brightest clump has @xmath52 .",
    "for an example of such an object take @xmath53 , 3 kpc distant , tidal radius 50 pc , thus subtending @xmath31 on the sky . the number of signal counts above 1 gev within @xmath31 for 30 , 60 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 300 gev wimps is 3450 , 1680 , 900 , 520 , 345 , 190 respectively .",
    "the number of detectable dark matter satellites is shown in figure  [ fig : nclumps ] .",
    "a pure dark matter galactic satellite has four distinguishing characteristics : hadronic spectrum from monochromatic quarks , spatial extent , lack of variability , and no emission at other wavelengths except for very diffuse inverse compton and synchrotron @xcite . we will focus on the energy spectrum , but we note that a satellite with an nfw profile has a brightness proportional to @xmath54 , meaning equal flux in equal width annuli . with the @xmath55 psf of glast above 1 gev , and the typical @xmath31 size , we expect that the spatial extent should be detectable .",
    "naively , emission between @xmath56 and @xmath57 has @xmath58 of the total significance .    to mimic a galactic satellite ,",
    "a source would need to have a broken power law spectrum , no counterparts in other wavelengths , and degree - scale extended emission constant in time .",
    "each of these is exhibited by known sources , but none exhibits them all",
    ". a class of such sources would need to have identical spectra ( as measured ) , as dark matter satellites would .    in figures  [ fig",
    ": mockdata30]-[fig : mockdata200 ] we plot the spectrum of the typical brightest clump @xmath59 with 30 , 100 , and 200 gev wimps together with fits for several astrophysical source classes .",
    "the @xmath60 errors for glast are shown as shaded boxes . in figure",
    "[ fig : nclumps ] we illustrate the detection significance required to distinguish dark matter from molecular clouds and pulsars .",
    "the gamma ray spectrum from molecular clouds is generated by cosmic ray protons , which have a featureless power - law spectrum over many decades in energy .",
    "this is are exactly what is plotted with dotted lines in figure  [ fig : fullspectrum ] .",
    "the long dashed lines in figures  [ fig : mockdata30]-[fig : mockdata200 ] show the best fit molecular cloud spectra , ruled out at high confidence in each case .",
    "gamma rays from molecular clouds are expected to be extended and non - variable ; it would be comforting to rule out counterparts , e.g. co emission .",
    "in fact , glast is likely to detect extended , high - latitude molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "gamma ray pulsars are potentially the most problematic of the astrophysical sources .",
    "their spectra can be parameterized as @xmath61 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "the few known examples have @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , most models for gamma ray pulsars require this ( e.g. the outer gap model @xcite ) , but @xmath63 is in principle possible .    the short dashed lines in figures  [ fig : mockdata30]-[fig : mockdata200 ] show the best fit gamma ray pulsar spectra .",
    "the @xmath64 spectrum is ruled out except in the 200 gev case , where it is consistent at the 8% level . if the low energy slope @xmath65 , the spectra become nearly impossible to disentangle for any wimp mass .",
    "gamma ray pulsars tend to have multi - wavelength counterparts and also tend to be near the galactic plane .",
    "a notable exception is 3eg j1835 + 5918 which is located at high latitude , but does have a faint x - ray counterpart  @xcite . the well known radio quiet gamma ray pulsar geminga is located within @xmath66 of the galactic plane .",
    "the variability of the pulsar is difficult to determine in a blind search of the period - period derivative plane . to mimic an extended galactic satellite , a cluster of pulsars",
    "would be required , with no counterparts in other wavelengths .",
    "plerions will typically have multi - wavelength counterparts , especially in x - rays , and are located close to the galactic plane .",
    "they are compact sources in x - rays ( @xmath67 ) , but at glast energies they may be detected as extended sources .",
    "supernova remnants will have power - law spectra , convincingly ruled out .",
    "they will also have multi - wavelength counterparts and are likely to be near the galactic plane .",
    "blazars are variable point sources with a power - law gamma ray spectrum , and have counterparts .",
    "they contradict all four necessary qualities of dark matter satellite emission .",
    "we have shown that the brightest dark matter satellites seen by glast should be distinguishable from other known types of astrophysical sources , for wimps less massive than about 150 gev and cross sections of @xmath68 @xmath50 s@xmath51 .",
    "sub - substructure could enhance these signals by a factor of a few @xcite , extending the accessible masses and cross sections .",
    "dimmer sources ( extended only , to minimize pulsar contamination ) could be stacked , improving the discrimination .",
    "any sources mimicking dark matter annihilation would be very interesting , and would be compelling targets for study in a multiwavelength campaign .",
    "dark matter sources are excellent targets for imaging atmospheric cerenkov telescopes ( iacts ) .",
    "the mass of the wimp must be above the iact analysis threshold , at the present time around 100 gev .",
    "the sensitivity of iacts is currently limited by the charged particle background .    a follow - up campaign of 500 hours with an iact of 0.2 km@xmath22 on our brightest clump , taking the 100 gev model , can provide a 5@xmath69 detection of line emission from the process @xmath70 , for a branching ratio of @xmath71",
    "this assumes 99% rejection of hadrons and 15% energy resolution .",
    "if the hadron rejection were improved by a factor of 10 , the electron background dominates and line sensitivity improves to @xmath72 . if the electron background were also eliminated , the extragalactic gamma - ray background would limit the sensitivity to @xmath73 .",
    "the predicted branching ratio is @xmath74 .",
    "obviously , the detection of a line at these energies would demonstrate the existence of particle dark matter .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) may discover a candidate wimp , and measure its mass at the 10% level on a timescale that matches the glast program .",
    "a simple estimate shows that glast can constrain the mass at the 25% level , for a 100 gev wimp .",
    "if the glast and lhc mass estimates match , the wimp hypothesis would be greatly strengthened . with strong evidence for particle dark matter in hand , including accelerator measurements of cross sections",
    "@xcite , it would become possible to map the galactic dark matter in the gamma ray sky .",
