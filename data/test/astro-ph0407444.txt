    "recent accurate studies based on hst photometry @xcite have firmly established that the large majority of leo  i stars have an age comprised between 7 - 10 gyr and 1 gyr , but the dominance of intermediate - age population is known since the early ccd analyses ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the plan of the paper is the following : in sect .  2 we describe the observational material , the data reduction process , the artificial stars experiments , and we briefy",
    "discuss the color magnitude diagrams ; in sect .",
    "3 we report on the detection of the trgb , and on our estimate of the distance modulus .",
    "finally , the main results are summarized in sect .",
    "the data were obtained at the 3.52 @xmath9 italian telescope tng ( telescopio nazionale galileo - roque de los muchachos , la palma , canary islands , spain ) , using dolores , a focal reducer imager / spectrograph equipped with a @xmath10 pixels ccd array .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath11 arcsec / px , thus the total field of view of the camera is @xmath12 .",
    "the observations were carried out during three nights ( march 19 , 20 and 21 , 2001 ) , under average seeing conditions ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the data have been acquired during the same observational run already described in @xcite : any further detail may be found in that paper .",
    "we acquired five 300s exposures in i , and two 600 s and three 300s exposures in v , centered on the center of leo  i. all the raw images were corrected for bias and flat field , and the overscan region was trimmed using standard iraf procedures .",
    "each set of five images ( per filter ) was registered , flux - normalized and combined into one single _",
    "master frame _ using the tasks _",
    "interp.csh _ and _ ref.csh _ of the isis-2.1 package @xcite .",
    "isis is able to combine images into a master frame having the seeing of the best image in the set , without any loss of flux @xcite .",
    "the psf - fitting procedure was performed independently on each v and i master image , using a version of dophot @xcite modified by p. montegriffo at the bologna observatory to read images in double precision format .",
    "the frames were searched for sources adopting a 5-@xmath14 threshold , and the spatial variations of the psf were modeled with a quadratic polynomial .",
    "a final catalogue listing the instrumental v , i magnitudes for all the stars in each field has been obtained by cross - correlating the v and i catalogues . only the sources classified as stars by the code have been retained .",
    "aperture corrections have been determined on a sample of bright and isolated stars in each of the master frames and applied to the catalogues .",
    "the transformation to the standard johnson - cousins photometric system has been achieved using the calibrating relation obtained and described in @xcite .",
    "the absolute calibration has been checked against independent photometries @xcite and it has been found to be accurate at the @xmath15 mag level ( see * ? ? ?",
    "leo  i is one of the best studied local dwarf spheroidals .",
    "hence it is worth to check if there are other available datasets that may provide support to the present analysis .",
    "the search of the eso archive has been successful .",
    "we retrieved from the eso archive one v and one i 90 s frames centered on leo  i taken with the fors  1 imager at the vlt - antu telescope , at cerro paranal , chile , on the night of december 2 , 1999 .",
    "the field of view is @xmath16 and the pixel scale is @xmath17 arcsec / px .",
    "the images were taken under excellent seeing conditions ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the images were reduced in the same way described above and were calibrated directly on the calibrated catalogues obtained from the tng data . in the following",
    "we will refer to the tng and vlt dataset as to the _ tng sample _ and _ vlt sample _",
    ", respectively .    .",
    "the open circles in the tng cmd mark the carbon stars we have identified from @xcite.,width=317 ]      the color magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) of both the considered samples are displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "the two diagrams are very similar but the higher accuracy of the vlt relative photometry may be appreciated at a first glance , and it is probably due to the combination of the larger collecting area of the telescope and the much better seeing conditions .",
    "the morphology of the cmds shown in fig .",
    "1 is fully consistent with those presented and described in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the cmds are dominated by the steep rgb of leo  i extending from the limiting magnitude to @xmath19 .",
    "a handful of bright agb stars ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are also present above this luminosity , in the range @xmath20 . among these stars",
    "we have marked with open circles ( in the tng sample ) the carbon stars identified by @xcite .",
    "the compressed color scale of the cmds , that has been adopted to include the reddest stars at @xmath21 , prevents a clear view of the red clump ( rc ) of helium - burning stars that is quite evident in enlarged cmds , peaking at @xmath22 , slightly bluer than the rgb sequence at that magnitude .",
    "the sparse plume of stars around @xmath23 and @xmath24 has been identified by @xcite as the high - mass tail of he - burning stars of leo  i.      to quantify the effects of the data reduction process on our photometry we performed a set of artificial stars experiments on the tng dataset .",
    "we followed exactly the procedure described in @xcite and we refer the interested reader to that paper for any detail .",
    "the artificial stars were extracted from a lf similar to the observed one , with the additional requirement that they must lie on the average ridge line representing the observed rgb ( see fig .  2 , upper left panel ) .",
    "we limited the artificial stars experiments to rgb stars with @xmath25 .",
    "the stars were added ( @xmath26 at a time to avoid any spurious modification of the actual crowding conditions ) to the master frames and the whole process of data reduction was repeated at any run .    .",
    "the excess of stars in the half - part of the diagram of positive magnitude difference is due to blended stars that are recovered with as brighter sources with respect to their input counterparts.,width=317 ]    the difference between input and output magnitudes shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "2 confirms that the photometric errors are quite small and the degree of blending can not affect our analyses .",
    "the completeness of the sample ( not shown ) is larger than 80% in the whole range of magnitude considered by our experiments .",
    "the use of tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) as a standard candle is now a mature and widely used technique to estimate the distance to galaxies of any morphological type ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed description of the method , recent reviews and applications ) .",
    "the underlying physics is well understood @xcite and the observational procedure is operationally well defined @xcite . the key observable is the sharp cut - off occurring at the bright end of the rgb luminosity function ( lf ) that can be easily detected with the application of an edge - detector filter ( sobel filter , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or by other ( generally parametric ) techniques ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the necessary condition for a safe application of the technique is that the observed rgb lf should be well populated , with more than @xmath26 stars within 1 mag from the trgb @xcite .",
    "this criterion is clearly fulfilled in the present analysis since there are @xmath27 and @xmath28 stars within one magnitude from the detected trgb in the tng and vlt samples , respectively ,    the detection of the trgb is displayed in fig .  3 and 4 for the tng sample and the vlt sample , respectively .",
    "in both cases , the cut - off of the rgb lf is clearly evident and it is easily detected by the sobel s filter .",
    "we take the position of the main peak of the filter response as our estimate of @xmath29 and the half width at half maximum of the peak as the associated uncertainty ( @xmath30 for the tng sample , and @xmath31 for the vlt sample ) .",
    "the higher photometric precision of the vlt sample allows a more accurate location of the tip , with respect to the tng sample . as our final estimate",
    "we take the weighted mean of the two detections , @xmath32 .",
    "our estimate of @xmath29 is in excellent agreement with the results by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the estimate by ( * ? ? ? * @xmath33 ) is @xmath34 larger than our value .",
    "part of the difference may be due to insufficient sampling of the rgb lf , since their field is significantly smaller than ours ( @xmath35 , 2.6 times smaller than the tng field and 1.4 times smaller than the vlt field ) .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the comparison with @xcite which states that in their @xmath36 field they barely collect 100 rgb stars in the upper 1 mag from the trgb .",
    "these authors find @xmath37 , within one @xmath14 of our estimate , but still appreciably fainter .",
    "also in this case , problems of sampling and/or of absolute photometric calibration may be at the origin of the difference with our result .",
    "we regard our result as the most robust since ( a ) the sampling of the upper - rgb lf is excellent in both datasets and , ( b ) our photometric calibration has been successfully compared with various independent photometries .        at the mean metallicity @xmath2=-1.2 $ ] ( as derived in sect .  3.3 , below ) , the resulting distance modulus is @xmath44 .",
    "this estimate is affected by the combination of uncertainties coming from different sources , i.e. the estimate of apparent magnitude of the trgb , the calibrating relations , the reddening and the assumed global metallicity . to properly account for all these uncertainty factors we recur to a monte carlo simulation .",
    "we compute the final true distance modulus ( and its uncertainty ) as the mean ( and standard deviation ) of 100000 random realizations of the @xmath45 estimate obtained by allowing all the relevant ingredients to vary within their error bars .",
    "in particular :    * the * apparent trgb magnitude * was randomly extracted from two gaussian distributions with mean equal to the observed value .",
    "50000 positive deviations were extracted from a gaussian with @xmath46 and 50000 negative deviations were extracted from a gaussian with @xmath47 . to account for the uncertainty in the absolute photometric calibration we add to each realization of @xmath29 a component extracted from a gaussian distribution having zero mean and @xmath48 mag .",
    "* we added to * the absolute trgb magnitude * ( from the calibrating relation by b04 ) a random component extracted from a gaussian distribution having zero mean and standard deviation equal to the uncertainty of the zero point of the calibrations as estimated by b04 , i.e. @xmath49 . *",
    "the * reddening * values were extracted from a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath50 and @xmath51 to account also for slightly different reddening estimates found in literature ( for instance the reddening maps by * ? ? ?",
    "* suggests e(b - v)=0.03 ) .",
    "negative values of the reddening are excluded from the simulation . *",
    "the adopted * metallicity * values were extracted from a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath2=-1.2 $ ] and @xmath52 .    for each simulated point @xmath45",
    "was computed from the randomly extracted @xmath29 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "finally , the mean @xmath55 and @xmath14 of the 100000 realizations was obtained : @xmath56 , corresponding to a heliocentric distance @xmath4 kpc .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with the value tabulated in the recent review by @xcite , but the uncertainty is reduced by a factor @xmath57 by the present analysis ( see also * ? ? ? * who finds @xmath58 ( internal ) @xmath59 ( systematic ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that our distance modulus is in excellent agreement with the recent estimate by @xcite based on the mean v magnitude of 47 rr(ab ) lyrae variables discovered by these authors .      in fig .  5 the observed rgb of leo",
    "i is compared with the template ridge lines taken from the set adopted by @xcite .",
    "it is immediately clear that the bulk of leo  i rgb stars is enclosed within the ridge lines of ngc  6341 ( @xmath8_{cg}=-2.16 $ ] ; @xmath8_{zw}=-2.24 $ ] ; @xmath2=-1.95 $ ] ) and of ngc  5904 ( @xmath8_{cg}=-1.11 $ ] ; @xmath8_{zw}=-1.40 $ ] ; @xmath2=-0.90 $ ] ) . the average color - magnitude distribution is well represented by the ridge line of ngc  6205 ( @xmath8_{cg}=-1.39 $ ] ; @xmath8_{zw}=-1.65 $ ] ; @xmath2=-1.18 $ ] ) .",
    "consequently , we adopt @xmath2=-1.2 $ ] as the mean metallicity of leo i. the age difference between the bulk of the leo i population and the adopted templates @xcite may slightly affect this estimate .",
    "however this is not a reason of serious concern for the present application , since the dependence of @xmath53 on metallicity is very weak for @xmath2\\le 0.5 $ ] ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "and @xmath50 ) with the ridge lines of the templates adopted by @xcite .",
    "the bulk of leo  i rgb stars is enclosed between the ridge lines of ngc  6341 and ngc  5904.,width=317 ]    our result is broadly consistent with all previous photometric estimates of the mean metallicity of leo  i , all in the zw scale . in terms of mean",
    "/ median metallicity our estimates lie between the extremes provided by @xcite ( @xmath8_{zw}=-1.0\\pm 0.3 $ ] ) and @xcite ( @xmath8_{zw}=-2.1\\pm 0.1 $ ] ) , in good agreement with the low - resolution spectral analysis by @xcite and its revision reported by @xcite ( @xmath8_{zw}\\sim -1.8 $ ] , from 2 red giants ) and , finally , in excellent agreement with @xcite who finds @xmath8_{zw}=-1.6\\pm 0.4 $ ]    @xcite reported the first detailed abundance analysis of two leo  i red giants , based on high resolution spectroscopy ( hence , presumably , in a scale equivalent to the cg one ) .",
    "they find @xmath8=-1.5 $ ] and @xmath8=-1.1 $ ] for the two considered stars .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same authors provides also an estimate of the @xmath60 $ ] ratio for these stars , i.e. @xmath60\\simeq + 0.5 $ ] and @xmath60\\simeq 0.0 $ ] , respectively . from these values , using eq .  2",

    "we have provided a clean and accurate detection of the i magnitude of the trgb of leo  i from two independent datasets , tied to the same ( well checked ) photometric calibration . adopting the median metallicity we derived from the same data by comparison with templates rgb ridge lines , and the calibration of @xmath38 as a function of the global metallicity ( @xmath2 $ ] ) provided by @xcite we have obtained a new estimate of the distance modulus of leo  i , @xmath3 , corresponding to a distance @xmath4 kpc .",
    "the effects of all the possible sources of uncertainty have been taken into account by means of monte carlo simulations .",
