    "from its beginnings , progress in qcd at low energies has been impeded because there are no good analytical tools available in order to work with strongly coupled yang mills theories .",
    "nevertheless , in the last few years the ads / cft ideas has provided a new approach that could improve this situation .    at present a dual",
    "to qcd is unknown , but a simple approach known as bottom - up has been quite successful in several concrete qcd applications , such as in hadronic scattering processes @xcite , hadronic spectra @xcite , hadronic couplings and chiral symmetry breaking @xcite , mesonic wave function @xcite , among other applications .",
    "here we summarize the main ideas developed in @xcite , where a soft wall holographical model that describes hadronic spectra with an arbitrary number of constituents was proposed .",
    "the present work has been structured as follow .",
    "section ii is a summary of the model considered . in section iii",
    "we give some examples , and finally in iv we present some conclusions .",
    "we begin by considering an asymptotically ads space defined by @xmath0 and an action for arbitrary spin modes ( which depends on the spin of the hadron described ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     on the other side , solutions to rarita - schwinger equation in ads space are more difficult to get , but its spectrum is similar to the dirac case , as you can see for example in ref . @xcite .",
    "as is possible to see in fig 2 , again the results are somewhat high , but using @xmath1 , adjusted to @xmath2 resonances gives better results .",
    "the holographical model discussed here allowed us to obtain hadronic spectra with regge behavior , not only for the integer spin case , but also for spins 1/2 and 3/2 , and also to calculate masses for exotics . in order to do this we considered anomalous dimensions for operators that create hadrons , and",
    "the dilaton that was used has a form suggested by einstein s equations , corresponding to the ads metric .",
    "this two traits allowed the model to reproduce regge spectra in all cases considered , and therefore the model can describe hadronic masses in a unified phenomenological model .",
