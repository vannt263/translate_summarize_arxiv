    "self - supporting localized patterns in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , which are frequently called matter - wave solitons , have been the subject of many theoretical and experimental works .",
    "the solitons were first experimentally created in the condensate of @xmath7li atoms loaded in a strongly elongated ( cigar - shaped \" ) trap @xcite .",
    "the use of the feshbach - resonance ( fr )  technique @xcite makes it possible to tune the scattering length of the inter - atomic collisions in the condensate to a small negative value , thus providing for the weak self - attractive nonlinearity , which is necessary for the creation of stable solitons . in another experiment ,",
    "the solitons were observed in the @xmath8rb bec remaining in the trap after the onset of collapse induced by the switch of the interaction between atoms from repulsive to attractive @xcite .",
    "potentially , the fr technique in combination with a quasi - one - dimensional optical lattice ( ol , i.e. , a spatially - periodic potential induced by a pair of counter - propagating laser beams ) can be used to create solitons with a fully three - dimensional shape @xcite .    in most experiments ,",
    "bec is created in ultracold gases with repulsion between atoms . in this case ,",
    "bright solitons were predicted as a result of the balance between the repulsive nonlinearity and negative effective mass of the matter waves , induced by the ol @xcite . the corresponding _ gap solitons _ ( gss ) emerge in finite bandgaps of the ol s linear spectrum , where the negative effective mass is available .",
    "theoretical models of matter - wave gss were reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and their stability was analyzed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite additionally , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the stability of the gs was also studied against quantum fluctuations , following the lines of the approach which was earlier developed for ordinary matter - wave solitons in ref .",
    "experimentally , gss were created in the @xmath9rb condensate trapped in a cigar - shaped potential combined with an ol applied in the axial direction @xcite , with @xmath10 250 atoms in the established soliton .",
    "an essential ingredient of the experiment was the acceleration of the condensate , with the aim to push the atomic waves into the spectral region featuring the negative effective mass .",
    "another approach to the creation of the gs was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : one may add a strong parabolic trap to the ol potential , confining the entire condensate to a small spatial region , and then gradually relax the extra trap , which may allow the atomic cloud to remain in a relatively compact gs state .",
    "besides that , one may expect that a chain of gss may develop from the modulational instability of nonlinear quasi - periodic bloch waves trapped in the ol @xcite .",
    "binary mixtures of becs are also available as media in which various matter - wave patterns may be created .",
    "most typically , the mixtures are formed by two different hyperfine states of the same atom , such as @xmath9rb rb and @xmath11na @xcite .",
    "creation of a _ heteronuclear _ mixture of @xmath12k and @xmath9rb was also reported @xcite . as concerns the effective nonlinearity in the mixture",
    ", it is known that the sign and magnitude of the scattering lengths which characterize collisions between atoms belonging to different species may also be controlled by means of the fr technique @xcite .    in view of the latter possibility",
    ", it is reasonable to consider a binary bec with the ( natural ) intra - species self - repulsion , while the inter - species interaction is switched to attraction . in recent theoretical works",
    "symbiotic , it was proposed to use this setting to create _",
    "symbiotic _ bright solitons : while self - repulsive species can not support isolated solitons , the inter - species attraction may help to create two - component solitons .",
    "moreover , a similar perspective was discussed in the context of bose - fermi mixtures , where the interaction between bosons is repulsive , but the bosons and fermions attract each other @xcite .",
    "similarly , solitons in a binary degenerate fermi gas , supported by the attraction between the fermion species , were predicted @xcite .",
    "it was also proposed to use the attraction between fermions and bosons for making bosonic quantum dots that can trap fermion atoms ( in particular , gap solitons in the bec trapped in the ol may play the role of such dots ) @xcite .    as mentioned above , a salient property of gss is the negative effective mass , which should make their dynamical behavior drastically different from that of ordinary quasi - particles . in particular ,",
    "both one- @xcite and two - dimensional @xcite gss are expelled by the usual parabolic trapping potential , while being retained by the anti - trapping ( inverted ) potential .",
    "the negative effective mass may essentially affect the stability of two - component gss .",
    "if the bec species repel each other , the repulsive force , acting in combination with the negative effective mass , may actually keep the two components together . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this possibility was verified , for two- and one - dimensional gss in the model of the binary bec .",
    "it was demonstrated that , even with zero intra - species interaction , the repulsion between the components was sufficient to generate a family of _ symbiotic gap solitons_. adding nonzero intra - species repulsion expands the stability region of such gss .",
    "note that the symbiotic gss found in ref .",
    "@xcite could be both of intra - gap and inter - gap types , i.e. , with the chemical potentials of the two components belonging to the same or different finite bandgaps in the linear spectrum induced by the ol .",
    "the objective of the present work is to consider effects of the _ attraction _ between bec species on two - component gss trapped in an ol , in the case when the intra - species interactions are repulsive .",
    "as mentioned above , the necessary signs and magnitudes of the respective nonlinear coefficients may be adjusted by means of the fr technique .",
    "because of the negative sign of the effective gs mass , one may expect that the inter - species attraction _ destabilizes _ the two - component gss , with a trend to split them into separate single - species solitons .",
    "this expectation is confirmed below , by means of systematic simulations of the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) for the macroscopic wave functions of the two components , @xmath13  and @xmath14 .",
    "in the normalized form ( we set atomic mass , planck s constant , and the overall nonlinearity coefficient equal to @xmath15 , and the ol period equal to @xmath16 ) , the coupled gpes take the well - known form @xcite,@xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath2 is the strength of the ol ( actually measured in units of the corresponding recoil energy ) , and angle @xmath19 is a parameter that determines the relative strength and sign of the inter- and intra - species interactions .",
    "the case of the intra - species repulsion and inter - species attraction , which we aim to consider in this work , corresponds to @xmath20 . if @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent two components of a spinor bec ( therefore , equal atomic masses are assumed in the two equations ) with opposite @xmath21-components of the hyperfine spin , @xmath22 , then @xmath23 , with coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath24 accounting for the mean - field ( spin - independent ) and spin - exchange interactions between the atoms @xcite .",
    "these coefficient may be , if necessary , controlled by means of the fr technique , as mentioned above .",
    "equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) conserve the corresponding hamiltonian , and two norms ( scaled numbers of atoms in the different species ) , @xmath25",
    ". we will chiefly consider _ symmetric _ gs complexes , with @xmath26 ( section ii ) ; asymmetric states with unequal norms will also be considered , but briefly , in section iii .",
    "stationary soliton solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) are looked for as @xmath27where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are chemical potentials of the two components . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the two - component gss of the most fundamental type , with both @xmath28 and @xmath29 falling in the first finite bandgap of the linear spectrum .",
    "the starting point is the symmetric soliton with identical components , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where the real wave function , @xmath32 , obeys the ordinary stationary equation for the single - component bec , @xmath33this equation has gs solutions provided that @xmath34 , which actually implies @xmath35 , since we are interested in @xmath36 ( the inter - species attraction ) , as said above .",
    "the remaining interval , @xmath37 , corresponds to the ordinary symbiotic solitons @xcite trapped in the ol , with @xmath28 falling in the semi - infinite gap .",
    "equation ( [ u ] ) can be solved by means of known numerical methods gs , sakaguchi1 ( the variational approximation @xcite , which was first used in the framework of the gpe in ref .",
    "@xcite , becomes quite cumbersome if applied to gss @xcite , therefore we do not resort to this method here ) .",
    "we tested the stability of symmetric solitons , generated by eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) , against small random perturbations ( which include a small initial separation between the components ) by means of direct simulations of eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) . in agreement with the expectation that the effective negative mass of the gs can make the two - component bound state unstable against the splitting under the action of the inter - species attraction ,",

    "the dependence of both critical values on the norm of the initial overlapping bound state is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig6 ] shows the dependence of @xmath6 and @xmath1 on @xmath54 at fixed @xmath49 .",
    "the increase of the critical values of the lattice strength with the growth of @xmath55 is quite natural : as the inter - species attraction , which actually pushes the two gs components apart , gets stronger with respect to the intra - species repulsion , which tends to stabilize the gs , it becomes more difficult for the lattice to hold the components together .",
    "both critical values diverge in the limit of @xmath56 , since point @xmath57 is a singular one , as follows from eq .",

    "the growth of the splitting threshold with the increase of the asymmetry can be readily explained .",
    "indeed , as the norm of component @xmath48 becomes smaller , its width increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective pinning force ( the amplitude of the effective peierls - nabarro potential pn ) acting on the soliton exponentially decays with the increase of the soliton s width , hence a higher strength of the ol is required to prevent the splitting instability of the two - component asymmetric soliton .    , for @xmath63 , @xmath60 , @xmath41 , and @xmath64 ( in this case",

    "systematic simulations confirm the prediction suggested by the fact that the effective mass of the gap soliton is negative : if the ol is not strong enough , the inter - species _ attraction _ results in _ splitting _ of the two - component gs .",

    "the unsplit solitons ( with fully overlapping wave functions , @xmath44 ) are stable in strong lattices , with @xmath3 ; they split into a stationary symmetric state with separated components in interval @xmath68 , and , in weak lattices , with @xmath5 , the splitting generates a pair of freely traveling single - species gss .",
