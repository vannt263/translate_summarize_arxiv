    "at centimeter wavelengths , most of the radio continuum emission from the sgr  a complex arises from four distinct components : ( 1 ) the ultra - compact non - thermal radio source sgra * which may be at the very center of the galaxy ( lo et al 1998 ) ) , ( 2 ) the ` mini - spiral ' sgra west which is a rotating ionized ring around sgra * ( ekers et al 1983 , roberts and goss 1993 ) ( 3 ) the shell - type , non - thermal source sgra east which is possibly an energetic supernova remnant , located off - centered on sgra * ( ekers et al 1983 ) and ( 4 ) a triangular shaped halo which seem to surround all the other three components ( pedlar et al 1989 ) .",
    "in addition to these four main components , the sgra complex also contains many weaker but distinct thermal and non - thermal radio features which have been classified and cataloged by yusef - zadeh and morris ( 1987 )    using high resolution observations at 90 cm and 20 cm , pedlar et al ( 1989 ) obtained constraints on the relative location along the line of sight of the main components of the sgr  a complex .",
    "they showed clearly that much of the thermal gas associated with sgra west lies in front of sgra * and sgra east .",
    "fig 1a shows a 20 cm image of the sgra region . the large shell like structure is sgra east .",
    "the bright compact source within the shell and the bright extended region around it consists of sgra * and sgra west . at this resolution ( @xmath6 ) ,",
    "sgra * is not separated from sgra west and the mini - spiral - like structure of sgra west is not resolved .",
    "fig 1b shows an image of the same region at 90 cm with the same angular resolution .",
    "the difference between the structures in figs 1a and 1b is remarkable .",
    "the change in the structure is caused by the different emission mechanisms for sgra west and sgra east ( thermal and non - thermal ) and their relative location along the line of sight .",
    "the thermal source sgra west is seen as a depression in fig 1b whereas it appears as a bright emission feature superposed over the non - thermal source sgra east in fig 1a .",
    "the conclusion is obvious - sgra west is in front of sgra east and the former has become optically thick at @xmath2 = 90 cm and thus absorbs the radiation from the non - thermal source sgra east .",
    "the difference between the emissions at 20 cm and 90 cm is seen quantitatively in fig 2a , which displays ew cross - cuts through the images in figs 1a and 1b at the position of sgra*. at 20 cm ( thick line ) the minor peak on the east is due to the shell of sgra east and the strong peak is due to the combination of sgra * and sgra west .",
    "the strong peak at 20 cm turns to an apparent absorption - like feature at 90 cm ( thin line ) indicating that both sgra * and sgra east are absorbed by the optically thick sgra west .",
    "an important implication of this result is that , _ it is not possible to obtain any measurement of the flux density of sgra * at frequencies below about 500 mhz _ and thus no constraints can be placed at these frequencies on theoretical models which try to explain the overall spectrum of sgra * ( e.g. mahadevan 1998 ) . at these frequencies , sgra * is simply hidden behind an absorbing screen .",
    "fig 2b shows an image of the spectral index @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 ) of the sgra region between 20 cm and 90 cm made from the images shown in fig 1 . as expected for optically thick thermal gas , positive spectral indices",
    "are observed over the sgra west region .",
    "in fact the optically thick region seem to extend well beyond the extent of sgra west as determined by higher frequency observations ( ekers et al 1983 ) .",
    "as noted by pedlar et al ( 1989 ) , the mini - spiral sgra west seems to be embedded in a somewhat lower density extended ionized gas .",
    "furthermore , the spectral index of sgra east and the halo between 20 cm and 90 cm is ` flatter ' ( @xmath9 to 0.0 ) compared to the spectral index between 20 cm and 6 cm ( @xmath10 to @xmath11 : ekers et al 1983 , pedlar et al 1989 ) indicating that free - free absorption by thermal gas causes the turnover in their non - thermal spectrum",
    ". a quantitative estimate of the amount of thermal gas in front of sgra east and also in the halo was made by pedlar et al ( 1989 ) using high resolution images at 2 cm , 6 cm , 20 cm and 90 cm .",
    "they showed that ( 1 ) the mini - spiral of sgra west is embedded in a thermal - halo , about 1.5 arcmin in angular extent and a ionized gas mass of @xmath12 and ( 2 ) ionized gas with an emission measures @xmath13 pc @xmath14 and @xmath15 is present over the extent of sgra east ( @xmath16 ) and possibly beyond and ( 3 ) the triangular - shaped halo surrounding both sgra east and sgra west is possibly a mixture of thermal and non - thermal gas and may be responsible for part or all of the spectral turnover of sgra east between 20 cm and 90 cm .    in this paper ,",
    "we report observations of recombination lines at 20 cm and 90 cm using the vla .",
    "the 20 cm data clearly shows the presence of non - zero velocity ionized gas present over the entire angular extent of sgra east and also beyond .",
    "the 90 cm data shows zero - velocity lower - density ionized gas present along the line of sight to the galactic center .",
    "recombination lines ( rl ) at lower frequencies ( e.g. @xmath17 ghz ) are sensitive to lower density extended ionized gas due to enhanced stimulated emission in such gas at higher quantum levels ( shaver 1975 , pedlar et al 1978 , anantharamaiah 1985 ) . on the other hand , at higher frequencies ( @xmath18 ghz ) ,",
    "it is easier to observe higher density , compact ionized regions .",
    "high resolution recombination line observations of the galactic center region has so far been made only at frequencies above 5 ghz .",
    "( van gorkom et al 1985 , roberts and goss 1993 , yusef - zadeh et al 1995 ) and they have been useful in studying relatively high density ( @xmath19 3 ) ionized gas in sgra west , in the arched filaments and in other compact hii regions in that area .",
    "however , the extended lower density ionized gas in the sgra complex , for which evidence was presented in the previous section , has not been detected in high frequency recombination lines .",
    "we therefore undertook observations of the h168@xmath7 line at @xmath20 = 1374.6 mhz and the h270@xmath7 line at @xmath20 = 332.25 mhz using the vla .",
    "observations at 1374 mhz were made in 1996 in both c and d configurations of the vla using a bandwidth of 6.25 mhz and 64 channels .",
    "the velocity resolution was 21.3 and the velocity coverage was @xmath21650 .",
    "the data were edited , calibrated and imaged using standard procedures in aips software .",
    "the angular resolution of the final line and continuum images is @xmath22 and pa = 35 . for the h270@xmath7 line at 332 mhz",
    ", we used the data obtained in the d configuration of the vla in 1987 as a part of the continuum study published by pedlar et al ( 1989 ) .",
    "the velocity resolution of the data is 11.0 and covers a range of @xmath21300 .",
    "the angular resolution is @xmath23 with pa = 10 .",
    "fig 3 shows the spatially integrated profiles of the h168@xmath7 and the h270@xmath7 lines .",
    "the two line profiles are different which illustrate that recombination lines at different frequencies are sensitivity to different components of ionized gas .",
    "the higher frequency line ( i.e. h168@xmath7 ) extends over a large velocity range ( @xmath1 200 ) and arises in relatively higher density gas ( @xmath24 3 ) close to the galactic center whereas the lower frequency line ( i.e. h270@xmath7 ) is narrow ( @xmath130 ) and arises in a lower density gas ( @xmath25 3 ) which may be anywhere along the line of sight ( anantharamaiah and bhattacharya 1985 ) .",
    "note that the expected radial velocity for the line - of - sight gas towards the galactic center is 0 .",
    "the narrow feature near @xmath26150 in the 90 cm profile is the c27 0@xmath7 line .",
    "the h270@xmath7 and the c270@xmath7 lines are dominated by stimulated emission ( pedlar et al 1978 , anish roshi and anantharamaiah 1997 ) and thus their spatial distribution follows that of the continuum . with the sensitivity of the present observations",
    ", the lines are clearly detected only near the continuum peak .",
    "the lower frequency line is not discussed further here since it does not arise close to the galactic center .",
    "the h168@xmath7 line profile in fig 3 is consistent with single - dish measurements at this position by kestevan and pedlar ( 1977 ) . a slight uncertainty in the baseline ( i.e. the zero - level ) is still visible in the spectrum which is due to the residual 3-mhz ripple in the vla waveguide system .",
    "a significant narrow feature at a velocity of 470 is present in the h168@xmath7 spectrum which needs to be confirmed by further observations .",
    "fig 4 shows the continuum image of the sgra complex at 20 cm ( 1374 mhz ) in contours with h168@xmath7 line emission integrated over the velocity range @xmath26200 to + 42 ( moment 0 ) superposed in grey scale .",
    "the angular resolution is @xmath22 with pa = 35 .",
    "the continuum image shows the three main components of the sgra complex : the triangular shaped outer halo which is about 10 in size , the shell - like structure of sgra east and the bright central region , sgra west . at this angular resolution ,",
    "sgra * is not separated from sgra west . the integrated line emission in grey scale shows",
    "that the h168@xmath7 line emission extends over the whole of sgra east . there can be little doubt that this extended emission arises in ionized gas associated with the galactic center since the velocities are non - zero and the velocity extent of this gas is much larger than that of the line - of - sight gas detected in the h270@xmath7 line .",
    "the detection of an extended region of h168@xmath7 line emission is consistent with the conclusions of pedlar et al ( 1989 ) who attributed the turnover in the spectrum of sgra east to free - free absorption by thermal gas .",
    "there is also some weak h168@xmath7 line emission to the north of sgra east where the base of the arched filaments meet the sgra halo at @xmath27 = ( 0,0 ) .",
    "the velocities and spatial distribution of the h168@xmath7 emission can be seen in the channel maps shown in fig 5 .",
    "the h168@xmath7 emission can be identified in fig 5 in three distinct velocity ranges .",
    "taking into account the channel width of 21.3 , these three velocity ranges are ( 1 ) + 50 to 10 , ( 2 ) 75 to 115 and ( 3 ) 180 to 200 .",
    "in addition to these emissions , a narrow high velocity feature with @xmath28 470 was detected in the spectrum shown in fig 3 .",
    "the channel image at @xmath28 470 is shown in fig 6 in contours superposed over the continuum image in grey scale .",
    "if this line emission is confirmed by further observations , then it represents in - falling ionized gas at a high velocity and extended over a few parsecs .    in the velocity ranges + 50 to -10 and 75 to 115 , the line emission is spread over the entire extent of sgra east with the peak of emission in front of sgra west . comparing the observed velocities of the h168@xmath7 line at the position of sgra west with the velocities observed at higher frequencies by roberts and goss ( 1993 ) and yusef - zadeh et al ( 1995 )",
    ", it appears that the h168@xmath7 line emission does not arise in the ionized gas that is directly associated with sgra west .",
    "the ionized gas detected in the h168@xmath7 line is clearly extended and possibly lies in front of both sgra east and west sources .",
    "the similarity of the spatial structure of line emission ( which is from thermal gas ) and that of sgra east ( which is a non - thermal source ) strongly suggests that the h168@xmath7 line is dominated by stimulated emission .",
    "it is therefore possible that the line emission extends even beyond sgra east which may not be detected here due to lack of sensitivity and diminished background continuum . due to limited angular and velocity resolution of these observations , no systematic motion of this gas",
    "can be discerned .",
    "since there are three distinct velocity ranges where line emission occurs , the three regions are likely to be separated along the line of sight .",
    "some of this ionized gas may be associated with the halo and mixed with the non - thermal gas as suggested by pedlar et al ( 1989 ) .",
    "the peak of emission near 190 occurs south of the continuum peak .",
    "some weak emission at this velocity also occurs slightly north of sgra east .",
    "although negative velocities are observed in the higher frequency h92@xmath7 lines ( roberts and goss 1993 ) in the southern arm of sgra west , the h168@xmath7 line emission at this velocity is more extended than the southern arm and thus may represent a distinct component .",
    "the extended ionized gas observed here in the h168@xmath7 line is not observed in the lower frequency h270@xmath7 line nor in the higher frequency h110@xmath7 and h92@xmath7 lines .",
    "high resolution h110@xmath7 and h92@xmath7 vla observations may also have missed detecting extended gas due to lack of sensitivity to such structures . as explained in section 1 ,",
    "lower frequency continuum observations indicate the gas has a free - free optical depth @xmath29 at @xmath2 = 90 cm .",
    "these facts allow us to place some constraints on the density and emission measure of the ionized gas .",
    "fig 7a shows a h168@xmath7 line profile spatially integrated over a @xmath30 region of sgra east centered at ra = @xmath31 and dec = @xmath32 .",
    "this region is to the east of sgra west and thus the line profile has no contribution from the latter .",
    "as discussed in section 1 , this region shows a turnover in the spectrum of sgra east which is attributed to free - free absorption by thermal gas .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that the h168@xmath7 line in fig 7a arises in this gas .",
    "although the line profile in fig 7a is complex consisting of at least 3 components , for the purpose of illustration of the model , we approximate it by a gaussian with a peak of 130 mjy / beam , fwhm = 220 and a centroid near 0 .",
    "the integrated line flux is @xmath33 w m@xmath34 .",
    "the continuum flux density of sgra east over this region is @xmath1 36 jy / beam at 1.37 ghz .",
    "we assume an intrinsic spectral index of @xmath11 based on higher frequency measurements ( ekers et al 1983 ) .",
    "to illustrate possible models which can account for the observed line emission , we assume a homogeneous slab of ionized gas at a temperature of @xmath35 k to be in front of sgra east . fig 7b shows four models with different densities .",
    "the densities are 10 3 for the dash - dot - dash line , 100 3 for the solid line , 500 3 for the dashed line and 50003 for the dotted line .",
    "the emission measure in each model is adjusted to fit the observed h168@xmath7 line .",
    "it is clear from fig 7b that the models with the highest ( 5000 3 ) and lowest ( 103 ) densities do not produce the observed behavior .",
    "the high density model predicts a sharp increase in line strength towards higher frequencies , whereas the lower density model predicts an increase towards lower frequencies .",
    "only the intermediate density models predict lower line strengths at both higher and lower frequencies as observed .",
    "we favor the model represented by the solid line which has @xmath36 = 100 3 , em = @xmath37 pc @xmath14 .",
    "this model predicts a free - free optical depth of @xmath11.1 at 90 cm consistent with the observed turnover in the spectrum of sgra east ( pedlar et al 1989 ) . stimulated emission accounts for 90% of the line strength .",
    "the predicted line strengths in fig 1 ( solid line ) are consistent with non - detection at 330 mhz and between 5 ghz and 10 ghz .",
    "the model also predicts that recombination lines at higher frequencies ( @xmath38 10 ghz ) may be detectable .",
    "it is possible that some of the h66@xmath7 line emission near 22 ghz observed by mezger and wink ( 1986 ) from an extended component is from this gas . in the model represented by the solid line in fig 1b ,",
    "the total mass of the ionized gas is about @xmath39 m@xmath4 .",
    "ionization of this gas can be maintained by a single o5 star .",
    "note that this model , which is for illustration , is only for the ionized gas which is in front of a part of sgra east and which is responsible for the line emission shown in fig 7a . to account for the total line emission shown in figs 3 and 5 , it is necessary to separate the possible contribution from sgra west .",
    "this separation is not attempted here .",
    "if we assume that ionized gas with the same properties extends over whole of sgra east ( i.e. about 4 arminutes ) , then the total ionized mass is @xmath40 m@xmath4 .",
