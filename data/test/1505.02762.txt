    "the discovery of high @xmath0 superconductivity in cuprates led to a flurry of new ideas such as the idea of spin liquid state as one of the possible explanations for the emergence of superconductivity from mott insulating parent compounds @xcite and the importance of the physics of doped antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "an exotic spin liquid state from heisenberg types of spin models involving breaking of discrete symmetries such as parity or time - reversal symmetry , the so - called chiral spin liquid , has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the effective low energy theory of such chiral spin state normally involves a topological term called chern - simons term @xcite .",
    "it was originally studied in particle physics @xcite and mimicks the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite where such term appears as the low energy effective theory in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the chern - simons term can be generated by a fermion - gauge field coupling when the fermion is integrated out .",
    "one obtains a fermion determinant which gives the chern - simons term as the action for gauge field @xmath1 @xcite    @xmath2=i\\frac{n_f}{2}\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi}\\frac{m_{\\psi}}{|m_{\\psi}|}\\int d^3x\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\lambda}a_{\\mu}\\partial_{\\nu}a_{\\lambda}\\ ] ]    in euclidean space - time upon perturbative expansion @xcite , where @xmath3 is the number of fermion flavors , @xmath4 is the gauge charge , @xmath5 is the dirac fermion mass , and @xmath6 is totally antisymmetric tensor .",
    "the chern - simons action depends only on the overall sign of the mass rather than its magnitude even though the mass must be nonzero for the expansion to make sense .    in quantum magnetism",
    ", the magnetization curve may show the presence of plateaus .",
    "it is well understood that the plateau state corresponds to a state with gapped magnetic excitations while outside the plateau , the spin sector is gapless @xcite . in doped antiferromagnets",
    "@xcite , this leads to distinct natures of interaction between the fermions @xcite . a state with gapped magnetic excitations",
    "is normally associated with preserved continuous symmetry with no long range magnetic order in the direction transverse to the applied magnetic field @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we show that in the presence of a chern - simons term one can have either one of two scenarios : i)a spin gapped state occurs as the analog of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) with its chiral edge states ii)the system is protected against such spin gapped state . in this paper , we consider 2-d antiferromagnets on square lattice , as we did in our previous work @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the spin of the electron must be parallel to that of the local spin within the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the resulting dynamics is well - described by effective tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite @xmath7 where the spin sector modifies the hopping integral via the overlap of spin coherent states @xmath8 between nearest - neighbor sites , a mechanism well established from the studies of anomalous hall effect @xcite and doped antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "this coherent state overlap has two effects : providing the background flux for the fermions and the effective spin field that couples to the fermions .",
    "the spin sector should take an appropriate classical lowest - energy configuration which produces a staggered @xmath9-flux state @xcite with dimerization and staggered chemical potential needed to get a massive dirac fermion spectrum .",

    "the @xmath20 are dirac spinors representing electrons that couple to the spin sector s @xmath14 field via the pseudo - gauge field given as @xmath21 . here",
    "two comments are in order .",
    "first , the definition of the vector field @xmath22 looks as if it were a pure gauge .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the field @xmath14 may have vorticity , which turns out to be at the origin of a non - zero flux for @xmath22 .",
    "second , the action [ spinsectoraction ] is not gauge invariant and as such the theory is not a genuine gauge theory .",
    "we use nevertheless the terminology of pseudo - gauge field for @xmath22 , which we also refer to as spin field , because of the way it couples to the charge degrees of freedom . when the fermions are integrated out , we get the chern - simons term due to the fermion - spin field coupling given in eq .",
    "( [ csfromfermion ] ) . a similar final action but without berry phase has been studied in a different context @xcite .    integrating out the massive dirac fermions in eq.([holeaction ] ) , we obtain a chern - simons term in terms of the phase field @xmath14 @xmath23 with @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we first investigate the effect of this chern - simons term added to the action eq.([spinsectoraction1 ] ) by applying a duality transformation which introduces a hubbard - stratonovich auxiliary vector field @xmath26 @xcite and re - expresses the full action as    @xmath27    in this case , we have decomposed the phase field into vortexful and regular parts @xmath28 and defined vortex loop current @xmath29 .",
    "following boson - vortex duality transformation @xcite and working in euclidean space - time , we obtain the following effective lagrangian for @xmath30 @xmath31= \\int_{k } j^{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{v}}(k)\\frac{1}{k^2}\\left(\\left(\\delta_{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac{k_{\\mu}k_{\\nu}}{k^2}\\right)-\\kappa \\pi \\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\alpha}k^{\\alpha}\\right)j^{\\nu}_{\\mathcal{v}}(-k)\\ ] ] @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "as in @xcite , the above result was obtained under the assumption that only configurations with closed vortex loops do contribute to the low energy physics .",
    "the effective magnetic field through a vortex loop is given by    @xmath34    we note that we get an extra term @xmath35 to the effective magnetic field coming from the chern - simons term .",
    "the important consequence of this is that the resulting effective berry phase for a vortex loop now has a total contribution coming from ordinary berry phase term and chern - simons term and is given by    @xmath36    where @xmath1 is the area of a vortex loop and equals integer multiple of @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the vorticity of the vortex loop , and @xmath39 is the flux of other vortex loop , nonzero only if that other vortex loop is knotted across the first vortex loop . comparing eqs .",
    "( [ newgaugefieldflux ] ) and ( [ vortexflux ] ) suggests that the chern - simons contribution is nonzero only if the two vortex loops are linked .",
    "we verify the above proposition as follows . for two nonintersecting curves @xmath40 ( which act as mapping from manifold @xmath41 ( circle ) to 3-d cartesian space @xmath42 ( the 3-d euclidean space in our problem ) ,",
    "the linking number is given by    @xmath43    taking the inverse fourier transform , with the vortex current given by @xmath44 and endowing the above expression with an overall coefficient @xmath45 , the above expression corresponds to vortex current - vortex current interaction    @xmath46=\\int_k j^{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{v}}(k)\\frac{1}{k^2}\\left(-\\kappa \\pi \\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\alpha}k^{\\alpha}\\right)j^{\\nu}_{\\mathcal{v}}(-k)\\ ] ]    in fourier space .",
    "this is precisely equal to the topological part of eq.([effeactionjv ] ) .",
    "this implies that the chern - simons term leads to the linking between vortex - loops , resulting in nonzero linking number , precisely as implied by eqs .",
    "( [ newgaugefieldflux ] ) and ( [ vortexflux ] ) .",
    "we now show how the field theory and the results in the previous section lead to the anyonic fractional statistics of the vortex loops excitations of the 2-d @xmath12 model eq.([spinsectoraction1 ] ) . without the chern - simons term , the @xmath12 model eq.([spinsectoraction1 ] ) has topological excitations in the form of vortex loops which , in the absence of destructive interference due to the berry phase , can proliferate .",
    "the vortex loops can be considered as worldlines of bose particles and the proliferation of vortex loops corresponds to a condensation of the bosons .",
    "this vortex proliferation implies disordering of the dual ( @xmath14 ) field , which gives rise to gapped magnetic excitations . in the presence of the chern - simons term ,",
    "vortex loops become anyons and a number of vortex loops must collect together in order to form a boson , and then be able to condense .",
    "one then can have either one of the two scenarios : i)the anyonic vortex loops are able to form bosons and condense , giving rise to a state with gapped magnetic excitations as the analog of fqhe state , ii ) the anyons fail to condense , for which a state with gapped magnetic excitations will not occur .    to show this technically in a simple picture , consider a system of two vortex loops with vorticities @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively knotted to each other once ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the partition function of this system has a contribution of the form    @xmath50    apart from the coulomb interaction , the contribution to the partition function given in eq .",
    "( [ partitionfunction ] ) resembles that of linked wordlines of anyon system with its fractional statistics @xcite . the first term in the exponent @xmath51 equals twice the statistical angle @xmath52 under the exchange of two anyons realized by vortex loops with vorticities @xmath47 and @xmath48 , giving @xmath53 .",
    "in 3-d euclidean space - time , there exists non - trivial braiding statistics between loops @xcite .",
    "our system thus manifests anyonic loop statistics in 3-d . with @xmath54 for elementary vortex loop , we obtain @xmath55 and therefore need @xmath56 anyons to get a boson before the anyons can condense .",
    "the occurrence of anyon condensation ( and that of spin gapped state ) thus depends crucially on the magnitude of the chern - simons coupling @xmath45 .",
    "the coulomb interaction then determines the critical value of the parameter that characterizes any possible condensation transition for this interacting system .",
    "we will show a scenario from a microscopic model where @xmath45 takes small enough values , leading to large @xmath57 and as a consequence prevents anyon condensation and the occurrence of a state with gapped magnetic excitations .",
    "in this work , we propose a way to generate a chern - simons term explicitly in a spin system from the fermion - spin field coupling .",
    "this topological term is obtained upon integrating out the fermions , as summarized in eq .",
    "( [ csfromfermion ] ) . the key ingredient is to have massive dirac fermions coupled to the spin field from the spin sector for which we propose to consider the staggered @xmath9 flux state @xcite and we will now describe the scheme to obtain it .    according to eq.([tightbindingh ] ) , the bare hopping integral is modified by the overlap of spin coherent states @xmath58 .",
    "this spin coherent state overlap generally takes complex values which gives an exponential phase factor where the argument of the exponent , to be referred to as link spin field , contains a static background flux plus the fluctuating part , representing a dynamical spin field . in order to get dirac spectrum",
    ", the static background flux has to take an appropriate configuration , which can be chosen to be staggered @xmath9 flux configuration @xcite . in order to attain such staggered @xmath9 flux configuration , in turn ,",
    "the spin sector should take a particular spin configuration accordingly . in the appendix",
    "a , we first derive the expression for the link spin field from evaluating the spin coherent state overlap explicitly .",
    "then , from that we determine the corresponding spin configuration to obtain the staggered @xmath9 flux state .",
    "we then propose a microscopic spin hamiltonian that stabilizes the required spin configuration .",
    "we summarize the results as follows .",

    "the mean - field part of the link spin field needed to give @xmath9-flux state is obtained by assigning @xmath64 their classical lowest - energy configuration values .",
    "it can be checked from eq .",

    "the need for such planar spin configuration fully agrees with the intuition that the total solid angle @xmath68 swept by the four spins around the square should equal @xmath69 for them to produce net flux @xmath70 equals @xmath9 with @xmath71 .",
    "similar planar spin configurations can be realized using @xmath72 model with impurity @xcite .",

    "our calculation confirms that the planar spin configuration is indeed the lowest - energy configuration of @xmath81 at least within a finite regime of phase diagram defined in parameter space ( @xmath84 space ) and therefore requires no fine tuning .",

    "we can therefore conclude that the spin system eq.([latticespinmodel ] ) is protected from being in a spin gapped state , due to the chern - simons term induced by the fermion - spin field coupling in doped antiferromagnets with a massive dirac fermion spectrum .",
    "in contrast , the conventional @xmath12 model with the berry phase term would mandate the occurrence of a spin gapped state . on the other hand , if the net chern - simons term vanishes , then the protection effect is inactive and one can get back a conventional spin gapped state that occurs for integer spin @xmath89 .",
    "it is to be noted that this result on the novel mechanism for protection against spin gap is valid for general spin @xmath89 because the applicability of the mechanism is determined more by the value of coupling constants of the spin model ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) rather than the spin @xmath89 itself",

    ". the net chern - simons term will be zero in this case . to remedy this ,",
    "we combine columnar or staggered dimerization with staggered sublattice potential where the staggerization takes 2-sublattice structure ; the chemical potentials of sublattices 1 and 3 are equal but opposite to the chemical potentials of sublattices 2 and 4 .",
    "the resulting mass matrix is      where @xmath109 is the mass from staggered sublattice chemical potential .",
    "it can readily be seen that the above mass matrix will give rise to nonzero net chern - simons term since the mass block - matrix of the @xmath251 sublattice pair is not opposite of that of the @xmath252 sublattice pair as the staggered sublattice potential - induced mass term matrix has precisely the same form and sign in both sectors .",
