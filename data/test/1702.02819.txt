    "the temperature increase leads to a decrease of exchange interaction and shifts the saturation to higher fields .",
    "all these features are detected in both transport and magneto - photocurrent experiments .",
    "moreover , due to the enhanced spin splitting the oscillations measured at low temperatures and high magnetic fields become spin - split which results in the beats .",
    "in low - dimensional semiconductor structures with lateral superlattices , a @xmath0 electric current is generated due to the action of an electromagnetic wave s @xmath121 electric field  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the superlattice is twofold : it generates a one - dimensional periodic electrostatic potential @xmath81 acting upon the 2d carriers with @xmath68 being the superlattice principal axis , and causes a periodic spatial modulation of the thz electric field due to the near field diffraction .",

    "[ field ] is caused almost solely by the metal dual - grating gate and not by the plasma oscillations .",

    "the ratchet current is generated by a combined action on carriers of both the radiation near field , transmitted through the grating , and the periodic static potential @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "a crucial condition for @xmath0 electric current generation is that the lateral superlattice is asymmetric .",
    "applying the voltages @xmath129 and @xmath130 in a controllable way , one can vary the potential @xmath81 and reverse the lateral asymmetry @xmath83 .",
    "consequently , the ratchet photocurrent can also reverse its sign as observed in experiment , see fig .",
    "[ gatedepb0 ] .",
    "the ratchet current has components both perpendicular and parallel to the metal fingers and consists , in general , of polarization - independent , linear- and circular - ratchet contributions .",
    "all these individual ratchet currents have been observed and described in various semiconductor - based structures  @xcite as well as in graphene with lateral periodical top gates  @xcite .",

    "[ gatedepb0 ] ) and , as we show below , is most relevant to the observed magnetic ratchet current .",
    "the seebeck ratchet effect is caused by inhomogeneous heating of two - dimensional electron gas and subsequent relaxation of the electron temperature . due to the near - field space modulation , the field @xmath82 acting upon electrons depends on the coordinate @xmath68 , fig .",

    "equation  ( [ j ] ) explains the reason for the ratchet current oscillations with giantly enhanced magnitude as compared to the ratchet current at zero magnetic field .",
    "the crucial issue is that the ratchet current in a quantized magnetic field arises due to heating - induced corrections to the conductivity rather than a variation of the electron density , and the conductivity in this regime is extremely sensitive to electron temperature variations . indeed , even a weak change of the electron temperature near the dingle temperature results in exponentially strong changes of the conductivity  @xcite .",

    "to summarize , we have experimentally demonstrated and theoretically explained the magnetic quantum ratchet effect , i.e. , the ratchet effect in quantizing magnetic fields . to generate the ratchet current we use an asymmetric interdigitated top gate superlattice on top of the investigated quantum wells .",
    "electric currents driven by terahertz electric field exhibit sign - changing magneto - oscillations with an amplitude giantly enhanced as compared to the photocurrent at zero magnetic field . the current amplitude and direction can be controllably changed by the variation of voltages applied to individual gate sublattices . the effect is observed in structures with various qw compositions and superlattice parameters .",
    "the photocurrent generation mechanism can be well described in terms of semiclassical theory of magnetic ratchet effects .",
    "the observed effect is driven by the periodic modulation of the electron temperature caused by near field diffraction .",
    "the theory of the seebeck ratchet effect in the presence of quantizing magnetic field shows that the ratchet current follows the oscillations of the longitudinal resistance . in the dms structures at low temperatures",
    "the investigated effect is strongly influenced by the exchange enhanced zeeman splitting caused by the exchange interaction of electrons with mn@xmath21 ions .",
    "finally we note , that while here we have dealt with a homogeneous magnetic field , the observed ratchet photocurrent in superlattices made of hard magnetic material ( dy ) opens a possibility to study the ratchet effect driven by an inhomogeneous periodic magnetic field recently suggested in ref .",
