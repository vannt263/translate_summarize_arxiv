    "physical cosmology  @xcite is the branch of astronomy concerned with the large scale structure and evolution of the universe .",
    "cosmology is unique in that two apparently disjoint disciplines  the physics of the very small and the physics of the very large  are both needed to achieve our current understanding of the universe .",
    "it is remarkable , for example , that quantum fluctuations that occurred on microscopic scales in the very early universe may have left an imprint on the largest structures in the universe .",
    "the observation that the universe contains matter  with only trace amounts of antimatter , rather than matter and antimatter in equal amounts , may find its explanation , one day , using earthbound particle accelerators .",
    "dark matter , for which there is much compelling evidence ,  @xcite may yet turn out to comprise weakly interacting particles that may be accessible in laboratories .",
    "the relatively recent synergy between the theories of the very small and the very large is a thrilling achievement .",
    "however , there is a cloud on the horizon called dark energy .",
    "@xcite    a big surprise in cosmology came in 1998 when the high - z team  @xcite and the supernova cosmology project  @xcite both observed , independently , that type ia supernovae were fainter than expected .",
    "after careful consideration of alternative explanations , both teams of researchers interpreted their observations as evidence that the sne ia are further away than expected , given their red shifts and assuming a decelerating universal expansion . if the sne ia are further away than expected , then the average expansion rate of the universe since the big bang must be higher than previously thought .",
    "both teams , in fact , went further : they concluded that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .",
    "today , the broadly accepted hypothesis is that this acceleration is driven by a form of energy called dark energy that pervades the universe . in the simplest model , dark energy",
    "is identified with the cosmological constant @xmath1 that appears in the general form of einstein s theory of gravity , general relativity . in more complicated models ,",
    "@xcite dark energy is modeled as a dynamical , evolving , field .",
    "cosmologists have created a compelling and coherent cosmology based on the friedmann equation @xmath2 and the associated friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric  @xcite , @xmath3 , \\label{eq : metric}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the dimensionless scale factor ",

    "however , it is common to choose units so that @xmath13 , thereby erasing the distinction between mass and energy . for pedagogical clarity",

    "symbols with a subscript of zero denote quantities evaluated at @xmath6 .",
    "the comoving distance @xmath20 associated with the radial coordinate @xmath18 is given by @xmath21 while @xmath22 is the proper distance at time @xmath23 . by construction ,",
    "the comoving and proper distances are numerically identical today .",

    "( [ eq : r ] ) simplifies to @xmath28 .",
    "the standard model of cosmology , with @xmath27 and @xmath29 , works remarkably well ; however , current physics predicts  @xcite a value of the cosmological constant @xmath1 that exceeds the observed value by a factor of at least @xmath30 ! this difficulty motivates the exploration of alternative explanations , such as ones that invoke time - varying  constants \" .",
    "@xcite after all , we know of no compelling reasons why the parameters that appear in our current theories of the physical universe should be independent of space and time . from some perspectives ,",
    "the puzzle is why they should be constant at all .",
    "@xcite    another motivation for exploring alternative explanations of the supernovae data is to determine whether they alone are sufficient to distinguish between a model with a cosmological constant and models without , such as the varying - g models we consider in this paper .",
    "a third , rather different motivation , is the pedagogical value of such investigations .",
    "this topic is ideally suited for directed individual study ( dis ) by an undergraduate physics major .",
    "it is exciting and lends itself to open - ended exploration .",
    "the work reported below was undertaken by one of the authors ( rd ) , an undergraduate physics major , under the supervision of the other ( hbp ) .",
    "we share the view of many that , ideally , all undergraduates should be afforded the opportunity to engage in authentic research .",
    "however , this is not always easy : many exciting topics unfortunately require rather more material than can be mastered in a reasonable amount of time by a busy student .",
    "the advantage of cosmology is that it is intrinsically interesting to many students and , provided one chooses the topic carefully and one is prepared to make appropriate _ conceptual _ approximations , one can find interesting cosmological studies that can be done using mathematics and concepts that are readily accessible to an undergraduate student .",
    "we fully endorse the idea that , for such students , a  mathematics first \" approach followed by applications is less desirable than the  physics first \" approach as advocated by hartle for general relativity .",
    "@xcite the cosmological investigation described below was done in that spirit .",
    "this paper explores two simple phenomenological models of varying - g cosmology  @xcite using the data compiled by kowalski _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on 307 supernovae .",
    "we assume a spatially _ flat _ ( @xmath31 ) universe ( motivated in part by the expectations from inflation  @xcite ) and we set @xmath32 . however , for completeness , we write all expressions in a form that is valid for arbitrary values of @xmath33 and @xmath1 .",
    "we find fits to the supernovae data that are competitive with the simplest dark energy model .",
    "the fact that non - dark energy models can account for these data is a reminder that the supernovae data alone are insufficient to establish dark energy as the preferred hypothesis .",
    "that hypothesis becomes compelling only when different data - sets are analyzed together .",
    "likewise , any varying - g model must fit not only the supernovae data , but must also be in accord with other data .",
    "however , in view of our expressed goal to provide an example of an authentic research project that can be conducted in its entirety by an undergraduate student , we restrict the scope to only one other datum : the bounds on @xmath34 at our current epoch .",
    "we find that our two varying - g models fail the bounds on @xmath34 , thereby ruling out this form of variation in @xmath0 .",
    "an interesting aspect of the first model is that the scale factor becomes infinite in a finite amount of time .",
    "in such a model , all comes to an end in a catastrophic shredding of everything , a doomsday scenario that has been dubbed the _",

    "[ sec : models ] introduces our varying - g models and summarizes the results we obtained from them .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "a key problem in observational cosmology is measuring distances to galaxies . to do that we need two things : 1 ) a standard candle and 2 ) an operational definition of distance .",
    "we consider first the standard candle .",
    "a standard candle is a source whose absolute luminosity is known .",
    "type ia supernovae  @xcite are currently the best  standardizable \" candles for very large distances .",
    "a type ia supernova is believed to occur when a star in a binary system overflows its roche lobe ( the region within which its matter is gravitationally bound ) causing material from it to accrete onto the companion white dwarf .",
    "the mass of the white dwarf gradually increases towards the chandrasekhar limit ( of about 1.4 solar masses ) ,  @xcite triggering runaway nuclear burning within the star that releases more energy in a matter of weeks than the sun will emit in ten billion years . in another class of models ,",
    "an explosion is triggered by the merger of two low - mass white dwarfs . in a third class of models , a carbon - oxygen low - mass white dwarf explodes when the helium , accreted from a companion star , detonates . for a good review of type ia supernovae models , see ref .",
    "@xcite . by measuring specific characteristics of the supernovae light curves ( graphs of brightness as a function of time ) ,",
    "it is possible to make empirically - derived corrections for the observed variations in sne ia brightness and thereby create well - calibrated standard candles .",
    "@xcite      the proper distance between two points in space is a well - defined concept , but , unfortunately , it can not be measured in practice .",
    "instead , astronomers use a definition of distance based on the flux of energy received on earth from the luminous object , that is , on the energy received per unit area per unit time , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the object s luminosity , that is , its rate of total energy emission , and @xmath19 is the proper area , at @xmath6 , of the sphere centered at the location once occupied by the supernova .",
    "this formula for the flux is valid for a static universe and for a source that emits energy isotropically . in an expanding universe , however , the luminosity @xmath12 crossing this sphere is diminished by the factor @xmath37 .",
    "one factor of @xmath38 arises from the reduction in energy of each photon received on earth relative to the energy it had at emission , yielding @xmath39 . by definition , the red shift @xmath40 where",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 are the emitted and received wavelengths , respectively .",
    "the second factor of @xmath38 is due to the reduction in the rate of arrival of photons at the earth , which yields @xmath43 .",

    "astronomers measure energy fluxes .",
    "but , by convention , fluxes are converted into magnitudes @xmath47 defined by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the flux from objects of magnitude zero , with the luminosity distance @xmath50 measured in mega - parsecs ( mpc ) , and absolute magnitudes @xmath11 defined by @xmath51 where @xmath52 mpc .",
    "next they take the logarithm to base 10 of the ratio @xmath53 to arrive at @xmath54 , \\nonumber \\\\              & = & 5 \\log_{10 } [ ( 1+z ) r(z)/10^{-5 } ] .",

    "the difference @xmath55 between the apparent magnitude @xmath47 of a source and its absolute magnitude @xmath11 is called the distance modulus .",
    "the analysis of a supernova light curve results ultimately in two measured quantities : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the data  @xcite used in our study are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sndata ]  -band filters .",
    "@xcite an observed supernova spectrum is red shifted with respect to the spectrum in the rest frame of the supernova .",
    "therefore , in general , a filter will transmit a flux that differs from that which would have been measured were it possible to measure the flux in the supernova s rest frame .",
    "astronomers use corrections called k corrections to map the measured flux back to its value in the object s rest frame .",
    "given a model of the object s spectrum , it is then possible , in principle , to infer the bolometric flux and hence the bolometric magnitude of the object .",

    "hence , @xmath62 noting that the light ray was emitted when the scale factor was @xmath63 and received when it assumes the value unity , today .",
    "our first assumption , which we have alluded to , is that the universe has zero spatial curvature .",
    "our second assumption is that the friedmann equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : feq ] ) , for a @xmath64 universe remains valid when @xmath0 is allowed to vary with time . by valid we mean that the equation is a good approximation to some ( unknown ) exact equation describing the evolution of the scale factor in a universe in which @xmath0 varies .",
    "this is an example of a conceptual approximation that renders the problem tractable for an undergraduate student .",
    "if we wish to remain strictly within the framework of general relativity , we should be cautious about replacing eq .",
    "( [ eq : feq ] ) with one in which @xmath0 is a function of time because the friedmann equation is derived from einstein s equations @xmath65 which do not permit variations  @xcite in @xmath0 .",

    "this , in turn , yields a modified friedmann equation with a time - dependent @xmath0 and additional terms of order @xmath34 .",

    "the inability to distinguish between models ( model degeneracy ) is inherent in the friedmann equation because the latter is sensitive only to the _ total _ energy density of the universe and is agnostic with respect to how the energy density arises .",

    "the hubble parameter @xmath154 is related to the _ sum _ of @xmath155 not the individual components ; or , equivalently , to the sum @xmath156 therefore , it is possible to entertain different interpretations of the total energy density .",
    "for example , _ any _ model based on the friedmann equation can be reinterpreted as one in which matter , perhaps of several different sorts , is either _ created _ , _ destroyed _ , or both , as the universe evolves .",
    "consider , for example , the simple cosmological constant dark energy model , for which @xmath132 , @xmath91 and the total energy density is given by @xmath157 .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath158 with @xmath159 .",
    "since @xmath160 is the dilution factor for matter , the function @xmath161 describes an increasing matter density in a comoving volume , which can be interpreted as the creation of matter as the universe expands ! alternatively , as done here , one can maintain the mass continuity equation , in which case matter is neither created nor destroyed and @xmath162 , but allow @xmath0 to vary like @xmath163 . because of the invariance of the friedmann equation with respect to such changes in interpretation , it is necessary to impose constraints on the cosmological parameters to remove the model degeneracy .",
    "such constraints can come from other data , or other equations , or both .",
    "it seems odd , at first , that the strengthening of gravity with time leads not to the eventual gravitational collapse of the universe , but rather to its accelerating expansion .",
    "the reason for this is that every form of energy contributes to the geometry of spacetime . a model in which the strength of gravity changes with time is equivalent to another model in which the energy density changes in a specific way . if the energy density dilutes more rapidly than @xmath164 , then the expansion will slow down .",
    "if the strength of gravity increases such that in the equivalent , constant - g model , the energy dilutes more slowly than @xmath164 , the expansion will accelerate . in our varying - g models , the effective energy density increases with time .    for model 1",
    ", the increasing strength of gravity leads to a startling prediction : a catastrophic end to such a universe .",
    "this conclusion follows from the limit @xmath165 of the lifetime expression , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lifetime ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath166 according to this model , the universe has a finite lifetime of about 33 gyr and will tear itself to pieces in its final moments ! such behavior has been dubbed the _ big rip _ and is a feature of cosmological models containing phantom energy .",
    "@xcite within regions that are dominated by non - gravitational forces , the effect of a cosmological constant does not change with time and consequently the accelerating universal expansion will not disrupt already bound systems .",

    "<S> the observation that type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are fainter than expected given their red shifts has led to the conclusion that the expansion of the universe is accelerating . </S>",
    "<S> the widely accepted hypothesis is that this acceleration is caused by a cosmological constant or , more generally , some dark energy field that pervades the universe . in this paper , we explore what , _ on their own _ , the supernovae data tell us about this hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> we do so by answering the following question : can these data be explained with a model in which the strength of gravity varies on a cosmic timescale ? we conclude that they can . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the supernovae data alone are insufficient to distinguish between a model with a cosmological constant and one in which @xmath0 varies . however , the varying - g models prove not to be viable when other data are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> this topic is an ideal one for investigation by an undergraduate physics major because the entire chain of reasoning from models to data analysis is well within the mathematical and conceptual sophistication of a motivated undergraduate . </S>"
