    "as we do not see any apparent differences in ple maps between the main spot and the satellites except for the slight redshifts , we speculate that these satellites come from bundles of nanotubes with the same chirality .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the redshifted values reported in ref .  , where samples without catalyst patterning are used and more bundles are expected .",
    "it is also interesting that the distributions of the peaks for the same chiralities are not isotropic , but show up as elongated ellipses corresponding to anticorrelated @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",

    "such a dependence arises from the fact that particles in one - dimensional system diffuse compactly in comparison to two- or three - dimensional systems where particles rarely go back to their original positions.@xcite    using the @xmath48 dependence of eea rate , we can derive an analytical expression for excitation power dependence of pl intensity from a simple rate equation taking into account the balance of exciton generation and decay processes .",
