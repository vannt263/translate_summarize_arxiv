    "most theories of hierarchical structure formation are based on the study of the evolution of density perturbations under their own gravity . a density fluctuation , which represents an over- ( or under- ) density with respect to the mean matter distribution , contains both baryonic and dark matter ( dm ) . the baryonic component sinks into the gravitational potential of the dm halo .",
    "it collapses and cools , resulting in star formation . in these scenarios , after the gravitational collapse of the dm halo , stars are assumed to be the first objects to form .",
    "a structure will thus end up as an emitting object after virialisation has occurred .",
    "an alternative picture involves the formation of a super - massive black hole ( bh ) that powers the central regions of galaxies @xcite .",
    "numerous studies have been performed that relate the quasar luminosity function to galaxy formation scenarios by assuming that the formation of quasars ( i.e. , bh ) in the potential well of the dm halos constitutes one of the phases in the galaxy formation process @xcite .",
    "recent observations even suggest that a super - massive bh may be present in the centres of all galaxies with spheroidal components @xcite .",
    "several authors have looked at several consequences of the presence of massive bhs on galaxy formation and evolution @xcite . in this paper , we investigate the cosmological implications of such an alternative scenario for the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and spectral distortions .",
    "more specifically , we study the effects of the outflows , driven by the bh activity , on the gas within the seeded proto - galaxy .",
    "in fact , the outflow expands and shock - heats the ambient medium ( proto - galactic gas ) , and then interacts with the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "three regimes of interest may be considered : 1 ) the high density region of the proto - galaxy , 2 ) the low density igm and 3 ) the thin compressed layer ( four times denser than the igm ) induced by the front shock .",
    "the second and third regimes give results very similar to those computed in @xcite .",
    "we thus focus on the first regime , i.e. the localised effects of the bh - driven shock on the gas within the seeded proto - galaxy .",
    "this shock - heated gas will compton scatter the cmb photons and induce spectral distortions and temperature anisotropies through the so - called sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite .",
    "the thermal sz effect depresses the cmb brightness in the rayleigh - jeans region and increases it above a frequency of about 219 ghz .",
    "its amplitude represents the integral along the line of sight of the electron pressure .",
    "it is proportional to the electron density @xmath1 and is characterised by the compton parameter @xmath2 defined by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the temperature of the gas , @xmath5 the physical size of the structure , @xmath6 the electron mass , @xmath7 the boltzmann constant , @xmath8 the speed of light and @xmath9 the thomson cross section .",
    "an additional secondary anisotropy arises due to the first - order doppler effect of the cmb photons when they scatter on a structure moving with respect to the hubble flow , with radial peculiar velocity @xmath10 .",
    "this interaction is called the sz kinetic effect .",
    "it generates an anisotropy , with no specific spectral signature , whose amplitude is given by : @xmath11    previous work on galaxy formation has evaluated the global distortion of a population of galaxies in the virialised regime .",
    "the global compton parameter was found to be much smaller than the constraints set by the firas instrument ( far infrared absolute spectro - photometer ) on board cobe ( cosmic background explorer ) @xcite on the global sz distortion of the universe .",
    "by contrast , our model focuses on a regime in which proto - galaxies undergo a bh formation phase that induces larger distortions .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in  2 , we model the shock in an individual structure and give its physical characteristics ( size and temperature ) . in  3 , we compute the predicted number density of primordial galaxies , using the @xcite mass function . in  4 , we generalise the description of the shock to the whole population of proto - galaxies and we simulate maps of the induced secondary anisotropies .",
    "we estimate this contribution to the cmb anisotropies .",
    "we also compare our predicted global @xmath2 parameter to the cobe - firas value and derive constraints on the model .",
    "conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "in the galaxy formation canonical scenario , a galaxy forms in the gravitational potential well of a dm halo of mass @xmath12 .",
    "following @xcite , we consider that each forming galaxy , which is fully described by the mass @xmath12 , hosts a super - massive bh .",
    "the fraction of seeded proto - galaxies is thus 100% . for the sake of simplicity , we assume that all proto - galaxies are spheroids",
    ". a more refined and accurate description would take into account morphological segregation @xcite .",
    "however , these effects do not introduce significant differences .",
    "we assume that the bh radiates during its lifetime @xmath13 a fraction @xmath14 @xcite of its eddington luminosity ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the latter is fixed by the bh mass , @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the proton mass and @xmath19 the gravitational constant .",
    "the mass of the bh should be directly related to the mass of the proto - galaxy it seeds , and thus to the fraction of baryonic matter locked up in the spheroid in which the central bh collapses .",
    "we assume a simple relation of proportionality ( @xmath20 ) between the mass of the bh and the mass of the spheroid @xmath21 . @xcite give @xmath22 and they assume that @xmath23 declines with mass .",
    "however , observations of galactic nuclei @xcite indicate that @xmath23 is relatively constant . here , we take the value @xmath24 as advocated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume that the medium is instantaneously ionised , which is very likely due to the intense radiation emitted by the central bh @xcite .",
    "we therefore study the propagation of a strong shock driven by a mechanical energy which represents some fraction of the bh luminosity .",
    "the first analytic solutions of spherically symmetric explosions were given by @xcite and @xcite and applied to several astrophysical problems such as stellar winds and supernovae explosions @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we study the expansion of the shock and its effects on the gas within the seeded proto - galaxy .",
    "we characterise the shock in an expanding universe by a set of physical properties ( its radius , velocity and temperature ) .",
    "adapting voit s solutions to our study , the shock at a redshift @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the redshift at which the bh switches on , has a radius @xmath27 which reads as : @xmath28 @xmath29^{2/5}(1+z)^{-1}.\\ ] ] it propagates at a velocity @xmath30^{1/5}\\,\\times\\ ] ] @xmath29^{-3/5}\\left(\\frac{1+z}{1+z_*}\\right).\\ ] ] in the two previous equations , @xmath31 represents the mechanical energy which drives the shock .",
    "very little is known about the fraction @xmath32 which can be on the order of 0.5 or even higher @xcite . for the lifetime of the bh in the bright phase , we choose the recent value derived by @xcite : @xmath33 years ( our results , however , are not very sensitive to the exact value of @xmath13 ) .",
    "@xmath34 is the mean over - density of the proto - galaxy ( assumed to be spherical ) , @xmath35 is the hubble constant , @xmath36 is the density parameter and @xmath37 is the baryon density in the universe .",
    "zero subscripts denote present day values . in the following and throughout the paper",
    ", we use @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite and give the results as a function of @xmath36 , for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the bh radiates 10% of its eddington luminosity , i.e. @xmath42 and that half of the corresponding energy is mechanical .",
    "furthermore , we consider that galaxies form at sufficiently high redshifts ( @xmath43 ) so that only hydrogen and helium are present in substantial amounts .",
    "we compute both the size and velocity of the shock and find that the host proto - galaxy is always embedded in the shocked region .",
    "the temperature of the shocked medium can be directly derived from the equipartition of energy : @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the mean molecular weight of a plasma with primordial abundances",
    ". the galactic matter can be shock - heated up to very high temperatures .",
    "for the most massive galaxies , we find that the matter is heated up to a few @xmath46 k , a value comparable to the temperature of the intracluster medium in galaxy clusters . for these temperatures and redshifts ( @xmath43 ) , the main cooling process at play is bremsstrahlung .",
    "therefore , the shocked gas looses heat with a cooling rate given by a temperature - dependent cooling function @xmath47 . we have compared three different cooling functions @xcite given in the literature for temperatures between a few @xmath48 and @xmath46 k. we find that the condition required for efficient cooling is always satisfied in our redshift range .",
    "this means that the cooling time , given by @xmath49 with @xmath50 the hydrogen number density , is always smaller than the age of universe .",
    "cooling is thus very efficient in our picture .",
    "the comparison between the three cooling functions shows that they all give essentially the same final temperature after cooling .",
    "we follow @xcite and we find that the shocked matter cools down to @xmath51 k at @xmath52 .",
    "in order to quantify the global effect of the formation of primordial galaxies on the cmb , we apply our formalism to a synthetic population of galaxies with masses @xmath53 .",
    "we first assume that the galaxy number density traces , within a linear bias , the abundance of collapsed dm halos , as predicted by the press  schechter ( ps ) mass function @xcite .",
    "we use an initial power - law spectrum with an effective spectral index @xmath54 on galaxy scales .",
    "we express the amplitude of primordial matter fluctuations in terms of the _ rms _ variance in spheres of 8@xmath55 mpc , @xmath56 ( as cluster - normalised , e.g. @xcite , which corresponds to a bias factor @xmath57 . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the set of parameters corresponds to the `` standard '' biased cold dm model , which does fit neither small- and large - scale velocities @xcite nor cobe normalisation .",
    "however , we take it as a study case for the computations , our second model is the low density cosmological model with @xmath59 . in our picture",
    "( no stars are formed yet ) , the spheroid is gaseous .",
    "its mass is related to the mass of the dm halo via @xmath60 .",
    "the mass and luminosity of the central bh and thus the predicted sz distortions are therefore inferred from @xmath21 ( @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ; cf  2 ) .    to compute the kinetic sz term of a population of proto - galaxies ,",
    "we need an estimate of their peculiar velocities with respect to the reference frame .",
    "as suggested by numerical simulations @xcite , we assume that velocities follow a gaussian distribution .",
    "the peculiar velocity of each proto - galaxy is drawn from a gaussian which is completely defined by its _",
    "rms _ value @xmath63 . in the range of redshifts",
    "we have adopted , the structures are in the linear regime , so that @xmath64 , where the redshift dependence of the velocities is given by @xmath65@xcite as a function of the cosmological parameters . in this equation , @xmath66 is the present - day _ rms _ peculiar velocity .",
    "it is related to the mass variance on mass scale @xmath67 , @xmath68 * @xcite * , where @xmath69 is the index of the power spectrum .",
    "the _ rms _ velocity can thus be computed for each mass scale .",
    "the shock - heated gas within proto - galaxies interacts with the cmb photons through the sz effect ( thermal and kinetic ) .",
    "these interactions generate secondary temperature anisotropies and spectral distortions .",
    "we simulate maps of the secondary anisotropies generated by a population of seeded proto - galaxies formed between redshift 5 and 10 .",
    "the maps have a resolution of about @xmath70 arcseconds to resolve the galaxies and contain @xmath71 pixels .",
    "the number of sources of mass @xmath67 at redshift @xmath72 is derived from the ps mass function .",
    "their positions are drawn at random in the map .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath73 profiles for , respectively , the thermal and the kinetic effects are directly derived from the integration of the gas profile @xmath74 along the line of sight ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : y ] and [ eq : dt ] ) assuming spherical symmetry .    similarly to the case of galaxy clusters",
    ", we assume that in the early stages of formation the gas settles into a hydrostatic equilibrium within the dm potential .",
    "a universal density profile is motivated by @xcite . however , the gas profile may be softer than that of the dm , and moreover the existence of a central cusp is `` unobserved '' @xcite.we thus conservatively adopt the following parametrised profile for the gas distribution : @xmath75^{-\\alpha } , \\label{eq : prof}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the central density .",
    "@xmath77 is left as a free parameter describing the steepness of the profile , whereas @xmath78 is identified with a core radius as in galaxy clusters . on cluster scales , @xmath78 is typically 10 to 30 times smaller than the cluster virial radius @xmath79 . in our model",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath80 which we vary , similarly to clusters , between 10 and 30 .",
    "the central density @xmath76 can be derived from the gas mass of the proto - galaxy using the following equation : @xmath81 where the virial radius of the structure is given by : @xmath82 for a critical universe .",
    "it is fixed solely by the mass and the collapse redshift @xmath83 .",
    "we will give the results for a flat model with no cosmological constant ( @xmath40 ) and an open model ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "varying the cosmological parameters will vary the number of proto - galaxies along the line of sight as well as their peculiar velocities .",
    "it will also modify their physical properties , i.e. the size and velocity of the shock and thus the gas temperature .",
    "the two cosmological models represent the upper and lower bounds between which all other cosmological models involving a non - zero cosmological constant fall .",
    "the cmb photons , scattering off the electrons of the ionised hot gas , induce a spectral distortion whose amplitude is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : y ] .",
    "the firas experiment has measured the mean compton parameter resulting from all the interactions undergone by the photons .",
    "the result is @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "this stringent observational limit incorporates the ( negligible ) contribution of the rather cold intergalactic medium and that of all other extragalactic signals . among these signals",
    ", there is the contribution of the hot ionised gas in galaxy clusters .",
    "the global distortion induced by intra - cluster gas has been computed @xcite , and found to be of the order of a few @xmath85 .",
    "in addition to galaxy clusters , one has to take into account the contribution of the proto - galaxy population in terms of the overall compton distortion , @xmath86 , induced by the scattering of cmb photons on the shock - heated gas .    based on simulated maps , we predict @xmath86 and we compare it to the limit set by cobe - firas . among all the parameters of the model ,",
    "there are four major quantities that substantially affect the predictions of the mean compton parameter .",
    "two of them , @xmath77 and @xmath87 , are related to the gas distribution ( eq . [ eq : prof ] ) .",
    "the two others are the fraction @xmath88 of bh - seeded proto - galaxies and the bh - to - spheroid mass ratio @xmath23 .",
    "we compare our predicted overall distortion to the cobe - firas limit and look for the combinations of parameters for which our predictions fit the observations .",
    "this allows us to constrain the assumptions of our model .    for @xmath89 , @xmath90% , @xmath62 and both cosmological models",
    ", we find @xmath91 which exceeds the observational value . in order for our prediction to be reconciled with the cobe - firas limit , @xmath88 must be only a few percent .",
    "this constraint on @xmath88 strongly violates the actual observations @xcite .",
    "@xmath89 is thus excluded by the limit on the global distortion whatever value we choose for @xmath80 .    for @xmath92 ( i.e. an isothermal profile ) , an @xmath40 model , @xmath90% and @xmath62",
    ", we find @xmath93 whatever we adopt for @xmath87 .",
    "the fraction @xmath88 must be smaller than 75% for the prediction to be compatible with the observational limit .",
    "again , this fraction is significantly smaller than the 95% advocated by @xcite .",
    "such a constraint could rule out the isothermal profile .",

    "if we now use the lower limit of @xcite , that is @xmath95 , together with @xmath96% or higher there is only a marginal agreement for @xmath97 between the predicted and measured distortions . in the open model case ( @xmath41 ) , we find approximately the same results .",
    "for @xmath86 to be compatible with @xmath98 if @xmath99 , the fraction of bh seeded proto - galaxies should be smaller than 80% if @xmath62 or @xmath100 if @xmath95 .",
    "the predictions for @xmath101 agree with observations in all the cases .    for @xmath102",
    "( i.e. the gas profile approximates a king profile ) and for both cosmological models , we find @xmath86 of about @xmath85 to a few @xmath85 , a prediction compatible with @xmath98 .",
    "this result remains valid for all values of @xmath87 between 10 and 30 including the highest boundaries of @xmath88 and @xmath23 , respectively , 100% and @xmath94 .",
    "we choose the set of parameters associated with the isothermal profile which agrees with the cobe - firas limit : @xmath92 , @xmath101 , @xmath96% and @xmath62 . within this context , we predict the upper limit on the contribution to secondary temperature anisotropies induced by the sz , thermal and kinetic effects , of the proto - galactic gas . we express this contribution in terms of an angular power spectrum plotted in figure [ fig : spec ] together with the main other well - known secondary anisotropies .",

    "it is interesting to note the good agreement between our results and those obtained by @xcite for the scattering of the cmb photons by the cloudy proto - galactic plasma .",
    "the power spectrum of the kinetic sz anisotropies for the @xmath41 model is significantly larger than the @xmath40 model .",
    "this is mainly due to the higher number of sources per unit comoving volume in open models . in all other flat cosmological models involving a non - zero cosmological constant",

    "the expected power spectrum due to the thermal sz effect is not plotted in this figure .",
    "it is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the kinetic effect contribution .",
    "this is due to the efficiency of bremsstrahlung which lowers the temperature down to a few @xmath48 k.    we compare the contribution of the proto - galaxies due to their sz kinetic effect to the major sources of secondary temperature anisotropies . in each case , we choose the most extreme cases for the comparison with our upper limit prediction .",
    "the power spectra displayed in figure [ fig : spec ] are taken from the literature .",

    "the primary cmb anisotropies dominate at all scales larger than the damping around 5 arcminutes . at intermediate scales ,",
    "several effects take place among which the inhomogeneous reionisation , the ostriker - vishniac and the sz effect . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec ] , we do not plot the power spectra of the thermal sz effect of galaxy clusters .",
    "it is about one order of magnitude larger than the kinetic sz effect . at very small scales ,",
    "the anisotropies are totally dominated by the proto - galactic contribution .",
    "previous studies on galaxy formation have evaluated the global distortion of a population of galaxies in the virialised regime . in these studies ,",
    "the global compton parameter was found to be very small , and smaller than the cobe - firas value .",
    "in contrast , our model focuses on a regime in which proto - galaxies undergo a bh formation phase . during this phase ,",
    "the proto - galactic matter is shock - heated up to a few @xmath46 k and cools down to @xmath48 k. cmb photons undergo inverse compton scattering on the heated gas .",
    "in addition , galaxy peculiar motions induce temperature anisotropies through the sz kinetic effect .",
    "we have estimated the global compton parameter due to a population of proto - galaxies and the expected power spectrum of the induced secondary anisotropies .",
    "we find that there are four main parameters that control our model : the fraction @xmath88 of bh - seeded proto - galaxies , the fraction @xmath23 of the spheroid mass in the bh , the steepness of the density profile @xmath77 and the gas core radius @xmath80 . the comparison between our predictions and the cobe - firas observation constrains these parameters .",
    "given the observed fraction of seeded galaxies , @xmath96% , our results put rather strong constraints on the density profile and on @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , our predictions agree with the observations whatever @xmath87 if the density profile is an approximation to a king profile . on the contrary , if the density profile is isothermal , then the core radius must be at least 30 times smaller than the virial radius and the bh - to - spheroid mass ratio has to be small , of the order of @xmath109 .",
