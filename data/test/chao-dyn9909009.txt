    "billiards are simple yet nontrivial examples of systems that display classically chaotic motion .",
    "of special importance are the sinai billiard @xcite and the bunimovich stadium @xcite since they are known to be completely chaotic .",
    "interestingly , these two systems exhibit two different mechanisms that generate chaos .",
    "while dispersion is the chaos - generating mechanism in the sinai billiard it is defocusing that leads to chaotic dynamics in the bunimovich stadium . dispersing yields a permanent divergence of neighbored trajectories .",
    "defocusing may occur upon reflection at a focusing boundary element .",
    "provided the free path is sufficiently long nearby trajectories start to diverge after passing through the focusing point , and on average the divergence might exceed the convergence thus leading to exponential instability . dispersing billiards",
    "are well known also in higher dimensions .",
    "popular examples are the three - dimensional sinai billiard and the hard sphere gas .",
    "however , it was not until recently that completely chaotic billiards were constructed in more than two spatial dimensions that rely entirely on the defocusing mechanism @xcite .",
    "these billiards use spherical caps as the focusing elements of the boundary .",
    "a trajectory diverges mainly in a two - dimensional plane that is defined by the points of consecutive reflections with the spherical cap , and focusing may be very weak in the transversal directions .",
    "this makes it more difficult to create truly high - dimensional chaos in focusing billiards than in dispersing ones .",
    "sufficient conditions for the construction of high - dimensional focusing billiards were given in ref.@xcite , but it was found that these are not necessary ones@xcite .",
    "besides of their intrinsic interest billiards are important model systems in the field of quantum chaos @xcite and statistical and fluid mechanics @xcite .",
    "questions related to chaos , ergodicity , transport and equilibration are often studied in billiard models , see e.g. refs.@xcite .",
    "while two - dymensional chaos is fairly well understood by now , much less is known in high - dimensional systems .",
    "recently , a high - dimensional billiard model has been proposed in the context of nuclear physics @xcite and quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "within this model a self - bound @xmath0-body system is realized as a convex billiard .",
    "numerical computations yielded a positive largest lyapunov exponent and showed that this system is predominantly chaotic . in this article",
    "we want to extend previous calculations and compute the full lyapunov spectrum and the ks entropy for this chaotic @xmath0-body system .",
    "these quantities characterize the degree of hyperbolic instability in dynamical systems and may be related to transport coefficients in non - equilibrium situations @xcite .",
    "since the studied billiard is convex , defocusing is the only possible source causing this instability @xcite .",
    "this makes it interesting to examine this mechanism in more detail and compare to the situation of defocusing billiards with spherical caps .",
    "the results of such an investigation are not only of theoretical interest but may also be useful for further applications .",
    "we have in mind general questions concerning chaos in self - bound many - body systems like nuclei or atomic clusters and its influence on equilibration , damping or transport processes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the model system and the techniques used to compute the lyapunov exponents .",
    "the third section contains the results of our numerical computations for various system sizes @xmath0 . in section four",
    "we investigate the defocusing mechanism in more detail .",
    "we finally give a summary .",
    "let us consider a classical system of @xmath0 particles with hamiltonian [ ham ] h=_i=1^np_i^22 m + _ i < jv(|_i-_j| ) , where @xmath2 is a two - dimensional position vector of the @xmath3-th particle and @xmath4 is its conjugate momentum . the interaction is given by [ int ] v(r)=\\ {    ll 0 & , + & .    .",
    "thus , the particles move freely and interact whenever the distance between a pair of particles reaches its maximum value @xmath5",
    ". hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) defines a self - bound , interacting many - body system .",
    "energy , total momentum and total angular momentum are conserved quantities . for large numbers of particles the points of interactions",
    "are close to a circle of diameter @xmath5 and therefore define a rather thin surface . therefore , this system is a simple classical model for nuclei or atomic clusters . for finite values of the binding potential",
    "the system is amenable to a mean field description @xcite .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) may also be viewed as a special case of the square well gas @xcite with infinite binding potential . however , to the best of our knowledge , the square well gas has not been investigated for such parameter values . in what follows",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of vanishing total momentum and angular momentum .    in the limit",
    "@xmath6 the number density diverges for the self - bound many - body system ( [ ham],[int ] ) .",
    "a constant density may be obtained once the parameter @xmath5 is rescaled as @xmath7 , thus turning the hamiltonian ( [ ham],[int ] ) into an effective hamiltonian . in what follows we work with a @xmath0-independent parameter @xmath5 . since the billiard is a scaling system one may easily rescale the results obtained below to adapt for different values of @xmath5 .",
    "the time evolution of a many - body system with billiard like interactions requires an effort @xmath8 to be compared with the effort @xmath9 for a generic two - body interaction @xcite .",
    "initially one computes the @xmath10 times at which pairs of particles may interact and organizes these in a partially ordered binary tree , keeping the shortest time at its root . immediately after an interaction of particles labelled @xmath3 and @xmath11 one has to recompute @xmath12 times corresponding to future interactions between particles @xmath3 and @xmath11 and the remaining ones .",
    "the insertion of each new time into the partially ordered tree requires only an effort @xmath13 . between consecutive interactions particles move freely . upon an interaction of particles labelled by @xmath3 and @xmath11 , respectively the momenta change accordingly to [ reflect ] = - 2a^2 . here ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the relative momentum vectors immediately before and after the interaction , respectively , and @xmath16 is the relative position vector with magnitude @xmath17 at the interaction .",
    "obviously , eq .",
    "( [ reflect ] ) describes a reflection in the center of mass system of the two interacting particles .",
    "we now turn to the computation of the lyapunov exponents .",
    "we describe the used techniques rather briefly since a large body of literature exists on the subject , see e.g. refs.@xcite .",
    "a hamiltonian system with @xmath18 degrees of freedom possesses @xmath18 independent lyapunov exponents @xmath19 ordered such that @xmath20 . since the hamiltonian flow preserves phase space volume there are also @xmath18 non - positive lyapunov exponents with @xmath21 .",
    "a system with @xmath22 integrals of motion has @xmath22 vanishing lyapunov exponents @xmath23 , while a chaotic system has a positive largest lyapunov exponent @xmath24 .",
    "this exponent @xmath25 is the rate at which neighbored trajectories diverge under the time evolution .",
    "benettin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite gave a method to compute the largest lyapunov exponent from following the time evolution of a reference trajectory and a second one that is initially slightly displaced .",
    "the displacement vector has to be rescaled after some finite evolution in a compact phase space . to compute the full spectrum of lyapunov exponents one has to follow @xmath18 trajectories besides the reference trajectory @xcite .",
    "this defines @xmath18 independent displacement vectors , and finite numerical precision requires their reorthogonalization besides the rescaling during the time evolution .    rather than following the time evolution of finite displacement vectors",
    "one may also use infinitesimal displacements ( tangent vectors ) in the computation of the lyapunov exponents . in tangent space",
    "the time evolution is given by a linear mapping .",
    "details about the tangent map in high - dimensional billiards can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in a completely chaotic system",
    "the ks entropy is given by the sum of all positive lyapunov exponents @xcite , i.e. @xmath26 . the ks entropy measures at which rate information about the initial state of a system is lost .",
    "in what follows we consider the @xmath0-body system at vanishing total momentum and angular momentum .",
    "we use units such that @xmath27 .",
    "times are then given in units of @xmath28 .",
    "we choose initial conditions at random and follow a trajectory for at least @xmath29 collisions .",
    "this ensures a good convergence of the numerically computed lyapunov spectra .",
    "we have checked our results as follows : the time evolution was checked by comparing forward with backward propagation ; the lyapunov spectra were checked by comparing the results obtained from the tangent map with those obtained by benettin s method involving finite displacements ; the computation of all lyapunov exponents showed that @xmath30 vanishes within our numerical accuracy ; we found four pairs of vanishing lyapunov exponents corresponding to the conserved quantities .",
    "the lyapunov spectra for systems of sizes @xmath31 particles are plotted in fig .",
    "we note that the @xmath0-body system possesses @xmath1 positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "this shows that there are no further integrals of motion besides energy , momentum and angular momentum , and that truly high - dimensional chaos is developed .",
    "we discuss this finding in detail in the following section .",
    "the lyapunov exponent @xmath32 is a smooth function of its index with a rather small smallest positive lyapunov exponent @xmath33 .",
    "this behavior is similar to the case of the lennard - jones fluid @xcite or the fermi - pasta - ulam model @xcite but differs from the hard sphere gas where a rather large smallest positive lyapunov exponent was found @xcite .",
    "note that the spectra seem to converge somehow with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] displays the largest and smallest positive lyapunov exponents , collision rates and the ks entropies .",
    "it is interesting to examine the @xmath0-dependence in more detail .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the ks entropy @xmath34 and the collision rate @xmath35 depend linearly on the system size @xmath0 .",
    "the case of the collision rate is easily understood since the constant single particle energy keeps the collision rate of each particle with the surface constant , too .",
    "the ks entropy is roughly given by the area under the corresponding spectrum presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . since the spectra converge approximately with increasing @xmath0 this area increases linearly with the number of particles .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath36 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and may be approximated by an logarithmicly increasing curve . in the case of the hard sphere gas",
    "the @xmath0-dependence could be understood for sufficiently low densities using techniques borrowed from kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these ideas can not directly be transferred to our system since the density is not a small parameter .",
    "note however , that the largest lyapunov exponent decreases with increasing @xmath0 once the density is kept constant after rescaling @xmath7 .",
    "this is interesting with view on nuclear physics since this result differs qualitatively from simple billiard ( mean - field ) models .",
    "scaling arguments for such models show that the largest lyapunov exponent increases with @xmath0 at constant density and single - particle energy .",
    "the numerical results obtained in this work indicate that the considered billiard systems exhibit truly high - dimensional chaos .",
    "we recall that the system is convex and does not possess any dispersing elements .",
    "furthermore , it differs in construction from the high - dimensional focusing billiards with spherical caps studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "thus , a closer examination of the chaos generating defocusing mechanism is of interest and presented in the following section .",
    "let us examine the defocusing mechanism in the billiard considered in this work . we do not try to proof that the considered system is completely chaotic  which seems difficult at least  but rather want to understand the numerically observed phenomenon of chaotic motion in more detail . to this purpose and based on our numerical results we assume that the system is ( predominantly ) chaotic , and that chaos is generated by the only possible mechanism , namely defocusing @xcite .",
    "we may then clarify how high - dimensional chaos develops and thus understand why we observe @xmath1 positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "this investigation may hopefully serve also as a starting point and a motivation for further research .    for simplicity let us consider the three - body system first .",
    "it is useful to study this system as a billiard in full six - dimensional configuration space .",
    "this is possible since the change in relative momentum ( [ reflect ] ) caused by an interaction of two particles corresponds to a specular reflection in the billiard .",
    "we denote vectors in configuration space by capital letters as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the two - dimensional position vector of the @xmath39 particle .",
    "the part of the boundary where particles labelled @xmath40 interact may be parametrized as [ b12 ] _ ( 12)&=&(+a2 _ , -a2_,_3 ) , + _ & = & ( , ) . the ( outwards pointing ) normal vector @xmath41 and the tangent vector @xmath42 span the two - dimensional planes where divergence due to defocusing might be generated .",
    "these planes come in a four - dimensional family due to the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ b12 ] ) .",
    "basis vectors for these planes may be chosen as _ 1&=&((1,0),(-1,0),(0,0))/ , + _",
    "2&=&((0,1),(0,-1),(0,0))/. similar arguments show that there are two further planes where defocusing might be generated corresponding to interactions between particles @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "these planes are spanned by the basis vectors _ 3&=&((1,0),(0,0),(-1,0))/ , + _ 4&=&((0,1),(0,0),(0,-1))/ and _ 5&=&((0,0),(1,0),(-1,0))/ , + _",
    "6&=&((0,0),(0,1),(0,-1))/ , respectively .",
    "four of the six basis vectors @xmath47 are linearly independent .",
    "the vectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 correspond to displacements of the center of mass and are orthogonal to the vectors @xmath47 .",
    "this is expected since the center of mass motion moves freely .",
    "it is important to note that the boundary is neutral ( i.e. neither focusing nor dispersing ) in the transverse directions .",
    "it is straight forward to generalize these considerations to @xmath0 bodies . in the case of the @xmath0-body billiard",
    "there are @xmath10 families of two - dimensional planes where defocusing might possibly occur .",
    "these families are related by those permutations that involve two out of @xmath0 particles , i.e. transpositions . @xmath50 out of the @xmath51 basis vectors @xmath47 are linearly independent .",
    "the two vectors corresponding to the displacement of the center of mass are orthogonal to the vectors @xmath47",
    ".    it would be interesting to relate the number of positive lyapunov exponents and the number of linearly independent basis vectors @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , the former can not exceed the latter .",
    "assume that defocusing causes divergence in the directions of all linearly independent @xmath47 .",
    "then there would be exactly @xmath50 positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "however , the conservation of energy and angular momentum puts two additional constraints , and @xmath1 is the number of positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "this reasoning is consistent with the numerical results presented in the previous section .",
    "the following picture thus arises .",
    "the boundary of the billiard considered in this work consists of several equivalent elements each of which cause a reflected trajectory to diverge _ only _ in a two - dimensional plane .",
    "the orientation of this plane is determined by the reflecting boundary element . in transverse directions",
    "the reflection is neutral , i.e. neither focusing nor dispersing . a trajectory that gets reflected from",
    "sufficiently many different boundary elements may exhibit divergence in all directions .",
    "it is interesting to note that this mechanism differs from the one investigated by bunimovich _",
    "the neutral behavior in the transverse directions has the advantage that it avoids the problems caused by the weak convergence occurring in the transversal directions upon reflections from higher - dimensional spherical caps .",
    "it has the disadvantage that several focusing elements are needed to produce high - dimensional chaos while a single spherical cap may be sufficient .",
    "we have computed the lyapunov spectrum and the ks entropy for an interacting @xmath0-body system in two spatial dimensions which is realized as a convex billiard in @xmath52-dimensional configuration space . in presence of four conserved quantities",
    "we find the maximal number of @xmath1 positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "thus , the system exhibits high - dimensional chaos . at fixed single particle energy the largest lyapunov exponent grows with @xmath53 while the ks entropy grows and the collision rate increase linearly with @xmath0 . in an attempt to understand the chaotic nature of the billiard we have identified several symmetry related two - dimensional planes where",
    "defocusing might be generated .",
    "their number and orientation in configuration space is such that a long trajectory may exhibit divergence in @xmath1 directions of phase space .",
    "this mechanism of focusing differs from the one proposed recently by bunimovich and rehacek .",
    "let us finally comment on chaos in realistic many - body systems . though the considered model is a crude approximation of realistic self - bound many - body systems like nuclei or clusters it incorporates the important ingredient of an attractive two - body interaction that acts mainly at the surface of the system .",
    "this is the basic picture we have for nuclei and clusters , where the complicated two - body force creates a rather flat mean - field potential , and particles experience mainly a surface interaction .",
    "however , unlike in the model system , an interaction at the nuclear surface involves more than just two nucleons , and the two - dimensional planes where defocusing is generated in the model system are replaced by some higher - dimensional ones .",
    "this might also introduce the problem caused by weak focusing in transverse directions .",
    "it is fair to assume that truly high - dimensional chaos may develop upon several collisions with the surface .",
    "though the detailed analysis seems much more complicated than in the studied model system , the basic picture developed in this work should be applicable to some extend also in the case of more realistic two - body interactions .    ya .",
