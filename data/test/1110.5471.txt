    "the effect of neutrino oscillations in vacuum lies beyond the standard model and is thus interesting both from the theoretical and experimental point of view .",
    "the oscillations in medium are also studied since wolfenstein , who showed that the neutrinos acquire a specific flavor - dependent potential due to the coherent forward scattering on the matter @xcite . as a result",
    ", the neutrino propagation in medium should demonstrate the conversion from one flavor into another ( i.e. flavor oscillations ) , even if the vacuum mixing is negligible .",
    "this spectacular result is known as the mikheev ",
    "wolfenstein effect @xcite and suffices to explain the deficit of observed solar electron neutrinos @xcite .",
    "according to mikheev and smirnov , the leading - order estimation for the electron neutrino flux depends only on the points where the neutrino was born ( the core of the sun ) and absorbed ( the detector ) .",
    "however , the properties of the medium between these two points can also slightly affect the flavor composition of the observed neutrino flux , leading , in particular , to the day - night ( solar neutrino flavor ) asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the latter effect being crucial for the entire flavor oscillations framework , a number of experiments were set up to catch this slight flavor composition variation resulting from the nighttime neutrino propagation through the earth . in april 2011 ,",
    "the borexino collaboration did report the possible observation of the asymmetry at the level of @xmath1 for beryllium neutrinos , however , with a high uncertainty @xcite .",
    "since other neutrino experiments have already yielded a considerable amount of data on the vacuum neutrino mixing @xcite , the question is whether it is really worth looking forward to the experimental discovery of the day - night asymmetry in the nearest future .",
    "namely , one may ask : based on the data provided by other experiments , how close is the theoretically predicted asymmetry to the present experimental resolution ? according to the analysis presented below , the magnitude of the day - night asymmetry is separated from this resolution by at least one order of magnitude .    within the neutrino oscillations framework , it is common to use the schroedinger - like equation to describe the spatial variations of the neutrino flavor @xcite . within the two - flavor approximation ,",
    "the schroedinger problem is posed in terms of the @xmath2 flavor evolution matrix ( operator ) @xmath3 , whose elements are the neutrino flavor transition amplitudes after traveling from the point @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "the evolution equation and the initial condition read , respectively , @xmath6 where the matrix hamiltonian is a point - dependent linear combination of the pauli matrices , @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the vacuum mixing angle , @xmath9 is the neutrino energy , @xmath10 is the difference between squared neutrino masses , and @xmath11 is the wolfenstein potential , which is proportional to the electron density in the medium @xmath12 and the fermi constant @xmath13 . the constant coefficient @xmath14 is the reciprocal neutrino oscillation length , up to the factor of @xmath15 , @xmath16    equation defines a one - parametric subgroup of @xmath17 and hence of @xmath18 , the translation along @xmath5 being the group operation . in this sense , equation is analogous to the bargmann ",
    "telegdi equation @xcite in the spinor representation @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the solution of the matrix linear ordinary differential equation , such as , can be represented as a time - ordered exponent ( dyson expansion ) @xcite . however , in the case of general @xmath19 profile , the solution in the sense of poincar ( in terms of a number - valued series without a symbolic operation such as time ordering ) appears to be too challenging to find .",
    "in the recent investigations , considerable progress was made in finding exact solutions of eq .   in certain special cases @xcite ; nevertheless , the general approach to this kind of equation still remains to be approximate .",
    "quite a large number of publications are devoted to the analysis of these approximate solutions .",
    "probably the most effective technique for finding the approximate solutions of matrix linear differential equations , such as , is the so called magnus expansion @xcite , which is a modification of the baker ",
    "hausdorff formula @xcite .",
    "this approach provides the solution up to any order of approximation , as well as the constraints on the remainder terms @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this technique @xcite , as well as the other general methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , do not provide the way to find the solution in its explicit form , not firmly fixing the earth model , namely , @xmath19 density distribution .",
    "it is thus desirable to find an approximate analytical solution of equation , which is valid under quite general assumptions about the electron density profile @xmath19 .",
    "this idea was also developed in @xcite .    in our paper",
    ", we are not only aiming at finding the relevant approximate expressions , but also at estimating their accuracy and applicability domain .",
    "namely , in section  [ sec : evolutionoperator ] , we find the approximate solutions for the flavor evolution matrix inside the earth , and then , in section  [ sec : dna ] , we arrive at the observation probabilities for the neutrinos of different flavors .",
    "these probabilities are finally subjected to the averaging procedure due to the continuous observation of the solar neutrinos throughout the year ( sec .",
    "[ sec : averaging ] ) , and the results of this averaging are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the magnitude of the day - night asymmetry appears to be sensitive to the non - trivial structure of the earth s crust under the neutrino detector , so the effect of the crust is paid special attention in section  [ sec : crusteffect ] . in particular , we show that our estimation for the neutrino day - night asymmetry is valid for beryllium neutrinos , which are observed in the borexino experiment . the detailed derivation of the approximate solutions for the evolution operator is moved the appendix to make the flow of the paper less complicated .",
    "in our investigation , we use the model electron density profile @xmath19 with @xmath20 narrow segments , where it changes steeply , separated by @xmath21 wide though sloping segments . let us call these segments cliffs and valleys , respectively .",
    "let the cliffs be localized near points @xmath22 , @xmath23 , namely , occupy the segments @xmath24 $ ] of widths @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "then the valleys are @xmath27 $ ] and have the widths @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , this kind of model is a good approximation for the earth s density profile known in geophysics , where it corresponds to the so called preliminary reference earth model ( prem ) @xcite . inside the earth ,",
    "the oscillation lengths of neutrinos with @xmath29 are of the order of 30 km , and the inequality @xmath30 takes place , i.e. the cliffs are narrow and the valleys are wide compared with the oscillation length . in the following , we will briefly call such density distribution piecewise continuous .",
    "it is worth saying here that during the night , the neutrino ray traverses different paths through the earth , thus , the lengths @xmath25 and @xmath31 vary .",
    "however , the assumption holds for the most part of the night .",
    "the total flavor evolution operator for such piecewise continuous density profile equals the matrix product of the evolution operators for all cliffs and valleys . within each of these segments ,",
    "the two small parameters arise : the first of them , @xmath32 due to the relatively small density of the earth @xcite , while the second parameter due to the piecewise continuous structure of the density profile , @xmath33    the evolution matrix for each segment , as well as the total evolution matrix , can be subjected to the following unitary transformations @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the effective oscillation wave number and @xmath36 is the corresponding phase incursion . for the calculations which follow , it is also useful to introduce the effective mixing angle in the medium @xmath37 @xcite , which is defined by the expressions @xmath38 in terms of this angle , @xmath39    the transformation with matrices @xmath40 locally diagonalizes the hamiltonian @xmath41 in the point @xmath5 .",
    "it thus makes the complete diagonalization in the homogeneous case @xmath42 @xcite . the transformation with the operator @xmath43 isolates the effect of the medium inhomogeneity , the transformed evolution matrix @xmath44 satisfying the equation @xmath45 where the dot over @xmath46 denotes the gradient @xmath47 due to the fact that the neutrino detector is homogeneous ( @xmath48 ) , eq .",
    "has a well - defined and physically relevant @xmath49 limit for any fixed @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , asymptotically convergent behavior of such systems of differential equations is stated by the levinson theorem @xcite .    in the homogeneous case ,",
    "the equation above is trivial .",
    "however , in the valley @xmath50 $ ] , the slow change of the density @xmath19 enables us to use the so - called adiabatic approximation leading to the same result @xcite @xmath51 where the remainder term is a ( generally speaking , non - diagonal ) matrix . on the other hand ,",
    "if the wolfenstein potential undergoes a considerable change within the narrow cliff @xmath52 $ ] with the phase incursion @xmath53 , then we get @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the jump of the effective mixing angle on the @xmath56th cliff .",

    "the neutrinos observed during the day are created in the point @xmath4 inside the solar core , then travel to the earth , enter the detector in the point @xmath60 and are finally absorbed in the point @xmath61 inside it . in the nighttime , however , after reaching the earth in the point @xmath60 , the neutrinos pass through @xmath20 earth s layers ( valleys ) discussed above , and only after that they enter the detector in the point @xmath62 and are absorbed in @xmath61 .",
    "crossing the sun - to - vacuum interface , as well as traveling inside the sun , does not involve steep electron density changes , thus we can treat the whole segment @xmath63 $ ] as a single valley . as it was mentioned earlier , the flavor evolution operator for the whole neutrino path is a matrix product of the evolution operators for each segment ( each valley and cliff ) . by the substitution of the approximate solutions and into representation ,",
    "after some transformations we find the total evolution operator in the form ( compare with eq .  )",
    "@xmath64 here , the subscript ` sun ' refers to the point @xmath4 inside the solar core , where the neutrino is created , and the evolution operator inside the neutrino detector is denoted @xmath65 .",
    "the factor @xmath21 in the remainder term indicates that it contains the sum over all cliffs and valleys .",
    "moreover , we use the following notation : @xmath66 it is also convenient to append definition with @xmath67 if the boundary between the earth s crust and the detector is abrupt , @xmath68 , then @xmath69 vanishes .",
    "quite analogously , @xmath70 vanishes for the abrupt vacuum - earth boundary .    by projecting the neutrino state onto the flavor eigenstates ,",
    "we arrive at the observation probabilities of the electron / muon neutrino @xmath71 where , for nighttime neutrinos , @xmath72 while for daytime neutrinos we have @xmath73 in the latter expression , we have omitted the exponential involving @xmath74 , considering the abrupt density change on the entry into the earth . the mixing angle immediately before the detector obviously takes the vacuum value @xmath8 in this case . moreover , the parameter @xmath75 is proportional to the inverse radius of the solar core and is thus much smaller than the other @xmath76 parameters .    due to the homogeneity of the detector substance and its smallness compared with the oscillation length , we easily find @xmath77 where the small parameter @xmath78 is the ratio of the detector width @xmath79 to the oscillation length @xmath80 .",
    "the quadratic remainder terms can obviously be neglected .",
    "in order to evaluate the probabilities obtained above , let us first make the averaging over the phase @xmath81 , which corresponds to the neutrino path between the creation point @xmath4 and the earth .",
    "the region of the neutrino creation is extremely large compared with the oscillation length , thus , after this averaging , @xmath82 with a high accuracy . using this fact together with eq .  ,",
    "after averaging we find , up to the terms of the order @xmath83 , @xmath84 the latter expression coincides with the famous result of mikheev and smirnov @xcite . on the other hand , after averaging over @xmath81 and neglecting @xmath85 terms , for the nighttime neutrinos we obtain @xmath86 where we have made use of the fact that matrices @xmath87 and @xmath88 commute up to a negligible term of the order @xmath89 .    for the calculations which follow , we will use the smallness of the jumps @xmath90 and the parameters @xmath91 . within the linear approximation in the earth s density parameter @xmath92 , this leads to @xmath93 partial derivatives with respect to the small parameters",
    "are @xmath94 in the above expressions , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the distance between the boundary of the @xmath56th shell and the detector , measured along the neutrino ray . finally , by substituting the derivatives and into eq .   and using the fact that @xmath97 , we arrive at the final result @xmath98 which is valid up to the terms of the order @xmath99 and quadratic terms @xmath100 .",
    "the term involving the product of the detector width @xmath101 and the oscillating factor @xmath102 is of the order @xmath103 and is thus omitted .",
    "the above expression provides a generalization of the main result of paper @xcite for the case of nonzero - thickness cliffs and detector .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that eq .",
    "gives poor information on the effects to be measured .",
    "indeed , the neutrino experiments last for years , and thus , eq .   may only acquire a predictive power after some kind of averaging . the averaging procedure should take into account the axial rotation of the earth ( involving the integration over the nights ) , as well as its orbital motion around the sun .",
    "the averaging procedure can be performed analytically , if the oscillation phase incursions @xmath104 vary by much more than @xmath105 during the night .",
    "namely , in this case , one can employ the stationary phase technique ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in the case of the beryllium neutrinos ( @xmath106  mev ) traveling through the earth , the oscillation length is about 30 km , while the widths of the valleys @xmath107 vary by many hundreds of kilometers , so the oscillation phase variations are indeed large enough to use the stationary phase approximation .",
    "the only layer , to which this approximation may not apply , is the earth s crust immediately under the detector .",
    "this layer is discussed in detail in section  [ sec : crusteffect ] appendix  [ app : crust ] and does not interfere with the picture described in this paragraph .     inside the earth and the neutrino path through it .",
    "the figure demonstrates the cross section of the earth which contains the nadir @xmath108 , the center of the earth @xmath109 , and the neutrino ray , width=453 ]    let us consider a neutrino traveling through the earth , which , according to the prem model @xcite , consists of a number of concentric spherical shells .",
    "the boundary between the valleys @xmath110 corresponds to the point where the neutrino crosses one of the interfaces between the earth s shells ; let @xmath111 be the radius of this interface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : earthdensity ] ) .",
    "further , the distances @xmath112 between the detector and the points where the neutrino enters / leaves the interface with radius @xmath111 are functions of the ` nadir angle ' @xmath113 $ ] defined as the angle between the direction to the sun and the nadir in the point of the detector . in terms of the solar elevation angle @xmath114 @xcite ,",
    "the nadir angle is @xmath115 .",
    "the nadir angle , in turn , is a function of the earth s axial rotation angle @xmath116 ( ` time of day ' ) and the orbital motion angle @xmath117 ( ` season ' ) .",
    "the dependence of the distances on the nadir angle is easily found to be @xmath118 where the upper / lower signs in correspond to the neutrino entering / leaving the interface @xmath111 ( see fig .  [ fig : earthdensity ] ) .",
    "the inequality ensures that the intersection of the neutrino ray with this interface exists .    in order to find the night average of the electron / muon neutrino observation probabilities ,",
    "let us note some properties of expressions and .",
    "first , the number of interfaces crossed by the neutrino is defined via the inequality , so the number of the valleys and , thus , the number of terms entering the sums in are changing during the night .",
    "the night average of eq .",
    "is therefore the sum of the averages of the terms entering this equation and involving each of the interfaces @xmath56 , each average being defined as follows : @xmath119 here , @xmath120 is some slowly changing function of the nadir angle and @xmath121 is the total duration of the night in terms of the earth s axial rotation angle @xmath122 , namely , the length of the segment where @xmath123 ( the sun is below the horizon ) .",
    "the duration of the night is , in turn , a function of the season @xmath124 . on the equinox , e.g. , @xmath125 , while on the winter solstice , @xmath126 .",
    "however , the summer nights are just as long as the opposite winter days , so that @xmath127 and the total duration of the nights over all the year is exactly half the year .",
    "therefore , the averaging over the year of @xmath128 days should include the division by the total duration of the nights , i.e. , @xmath129 . for @xmath130 ,",
    "the summation over the nights can be replaced by the integration , @xmath131 and the averaging formula for the terms containing the phase incursion @xmath104 takes the form @xmath132    now we are able to apply the stationary phase technique to such an integral containing the rapidly oscillating exponential .",
    "indeed , let us use the expression , which is valid for smooth functions @xmath133 and @xmath134 defined on a segment @xmath135 $ ] containing a single non - degenerate stationary point @xmath136 such that @xmath137 , @xmath138 @xcite @xmath139 the two leading terms come from the stationary point and the boundary , respectively .",
    "however , in the application to the integral , the boundary term vanishes .",
    "indeed , the boundary of the integration domain corresponds to the neutrino ray being tangent to the interface with radius @xmath111 , hence , @xmath140 , and the boundary term is absent . on the other hand , the stationary point is obviously achieved at midnight , when the nadir angle @xmath141 ( the sun is in its lowest position ) , so the integration over the night yields @xmath142 where the two possible signs before @xmath143 correspond to @xmath144 ( see eq .  ) .",

    "the midnight corresponds to the minimum value of @xmath147 , which is achieved at @xmath153 , @xmath154 using these expressions , we find the derivative of @xmath155 at midnight , @xmath156_{\\text{midnight } } = -      \\frac{\\cos\\chi}{|\\cos\\varsigma| } \\,\\frac{\\cos^2\\varepsilon      + \\sin^2\\varsigma\\sin^2\\varepsilon}{\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\varepsilon + \\tan^2\\varsigma } } \\equiv -\\mathcal{n}(\\varsigma),\\ ] ] finally , the integral over the night takes the form @xmath157_{\\text{midnight}}.\\ ] ] on the other hand , the midnight stationary ( minimum ) values of the nadir angle @xmath158 vary throughout the year ( see eq .  ) , being the smallest on the winter solstice ( the darkest midnight ) and the largest on the opposite summer solstice ( the lightest midnight ) .",
    "therefore , the right side of eq .   is still containing a rapidly oscillating function of the season @xmath124 , and we can perform another isolation of the stationary points , namely , of the two solstices @xmath159 : @xmath160_{\\text{midnight } } ,      \\label{eq : yearaverage }      \\\\      { \\partial}_\\varsigma^2\\cos\\theta_{\\text{n}}(\\tau_{\\text{midnight}}(\\varsigma ) ) =        \\begin{cases }           \\sin(\\varepsilon - \\chi)\\tan\\varepsilon , & \\varsigma = 0 \\text { ( winter solstice),}\\\\           \\sin(\\varepsilon + \\chi)\\tan\\varepsilon , & \\varsigma = \\pi \\text { ( summer solstice ) , }        \\end{cases}\\\\      s \\equiv \\operatorname{sgn}\\bigl\\{{\\partial}_\\varsigma^2\\cos\\theta_{\\text{n}}(\\tau_{\\text{midnight}}(\\varsigma))\\bigr\\ } =        \\begin{cases }           -1 , & \\varsigma = 0,\\\\           + 1 , & \\varsigma = \\pi .",

    "the detector used by the borexino collaboration is situated in the gran sasso laboratory , with @xmath162 , and the prefactor in which does not depend on @xmath56 amounts to be @xmath163    therefore , we are left with the following conclusion .",
    "the terms entering eq .  , which contain the oscillating functions of the phase incursions @xmath164 ,",
    "are suppressed as @xmath165 after averaging over the year ; within the leading approximation , the resulting averages come from the stationary phase points achieved on the winter and the summer solstices .",
    "the suppression becomes stronger for the inner earth s shells .",
    "it is spectacular that all the terms of the order @xmath166 in the expression , including the one corresponding to the detector , become @xmath167 after the averaging .",
    "the terms of the order @xmath168 , which are proportional to @xmath169 , become @xmath170 , respectively .",
    "finally , we are left with the average value @xmath171 by substituting this result together with the daytime average value into expression for the neutrino observation probabilities , we arrive at the day - night asymmetry factor @xmath172 where @xmath173 defines the observation probabilities for the solar neutrinos due to the mikheev  smirnov ",
    "wolfenstein effect @xcite and @xmath174 is the wolfenstein potential in the earth s crust under the detector .",
    "the estimation shown above is substantially based on the piecewise continuous structure of the density profile and shows that the asymmetry should depend only on the density of rock immediately under the detector , i.e. in the earth s crust . at the same time , the actual width of the crust is comparable with the oscillation length , and neither the valley nor the crust approximation is valid for this layer . moreover , the phase incursions are small within the crust , and so do their time variations , hence , we are unable to use the stationary phase approximation . however , we are still able to account for the effect of the crust on the observed day - night asymmetry factor , relying upon its relatively small density .",
    "this feature , together with its bounded thickness , makes it possible to find the closed form of the approximate flavor evolution operator for the crust @xmath175 $ ]  ( see appendix  [ app : crust ] ) , @xmath176 this result formally repeats the cliff approximation up to the substitution @xmath177 , @xmath178 .",
    "then , exactly the same modification arises in , @xmath179 where @xmath180 . the leading @xmath168 correction of the crust to the day - night asymmetry factor reads @xmath181 again , this result should be subjected to the averaging procedure to acquire the predictive power .",
    "however , due to the boundedness of the cosine , the correction is easily estimated ( both before and after averaging ) , @xmath182 within the earth s crust , the density change is within 2030% , hence the change of the wolfenstein potential @xmath183 .",
    "thus , the non - trivial structure of the crust could produce the deviation of the day - night asymmetry factor from expression only within 2030% .",
    "the only exception from this rule may occur if the detector is placed above the deep region of the ocean ( here , both the crust - to - ocean and ocean - to - air jumps of the potential are quite large ) .",
    "in this case , the day - night asymmetry factor can be readily found using eq .   and may become substantially smaller than the one measured by the continental detector .",
    "from expressions and , one can see that the asymmetry has the order @xmath168 and is determined by the rock density in the layer under the detector , i.e. in the earth s crust .",

    "formally , our estimation is in agreement with the results of the borexino experiment on the day - night asymmetry @xcite , @xmath190    the leading corrections not shown in come from the averaging over the oscillation phases inside the earth and are suppressed as @xmath191 .",
    "this suppression is quite strong for dense though deep inner earth s shells , including its core . for the typical number of the valleys @xmath192 ,",
    "the total contribution of these corrections is several times smaller than the effect of the crust specified in .",
    "the energy dependence of the predicted day - night asymmetry factor within the domain @xmath193 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : adn_e ] .",
    "we observe that the asymmetry vanishes for the low - energy neutrinos , which is a result of the applicability of the adiabatic approximation for such neutrinos . indeed , within this approximation , the neutrino flavor observation probabilities depend only on the creation and absorbtion points .    for the neutrinos with energies @xmath194 , eq",
    ".   becomes only qualitative .",
    "for instance , the energies of the boron neutrinos , which were considered , e.g. , in the paper @xcite , reach @xmath195 , while the oscillation lengths are as large as @xmath196 . for such energies , both the relative errors of the valley solutions ( multiplied by their number @xmath197 ) and the averaging errors may ,",
    "in principle , become quite large .",
    "one should also mention here that , although the day - night asymmetry factor is a quantity which is directly measured in the neutrino experiments , both its sign and magnitude depend not only on the neutrino regeneration effect inside the earth , but also on the value of the wolfenstein potential in the solar core , where the neutrino is created .",
    "this fact is easily seen in , where the solar effect manifests itself via the quantity @xmath198 , which depends on the neutrino energy @xmath9 . at the energy @xmath199 , which corresponds to the mikheev ",
    "smirnov resonance , we have @xmath200 and @xmath201 , and , as a consequence , the day - night asymmetry factor changes sign ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : adn_e ] ) .",
    "thus , it is the resonance inside the sun which makes the asymmetry , observed on the earth , vanish .     as a function of the neutrino energy @xmath9 plotted for @xmath202 and @xmath203,width=377 ]    finally",
    ", one may observe that beryllium neutrinos ( @xmath188 ) are indeed quite useful for the study of the matter effects in the neutrino oscillations , since they correspond to almost maximum negative asymmetry factor .",
    "moreover , solar beryllium neutrinos are highly monochromatic ( in contrast , e.g. , to the boron neutrinos ) and their flux is considerably larger @xcite .",
    "thus the borexino experiment is a prospective attempt to detect the day - night flavor asymmetry .",
    "however , we are able to conclude that the latter effect needs a 1020 times better experimental resolution to be distinguished at a considerable confidence level",
    ". this conclusion does not depend on the densities of the inner earth s layers and on the substance and the dimensions of the detector , as far as they are considerably smaller than the oscillation length .    as a demonstration of our conclusions about the time average of the day - night asymmetry factor",

    "in this section , we derive the approximate solutions for the flavor evolution operator @xmath213 ( see eqs .   and ) for the valleys and cliffs .",
    "first , due to the relatively small earth s density , which manifests itself as a small parameter @xmath214 , we resort to the linear approximation in @xmath92 , namely , take the two leading terms of the dyson series @xmath215      in the valleys , we have a smooth and bounded function @xmath216 and a rapidly oscillating matrix exponential @xmath217 . then , applying the double integration by parts , we arrive at @xmath218 since the total variation of the effective mixing angle @xmath37",
    "is bounded within the valley and has the order @xmath168 , all the gradients in the above expressions are suppressed by powers of the small parameter @xmath219 , where @xmath220 is the width of the valley and @xmath80 is the oscillation length .",
    "namely , @xmath221 using these estimations , one can readily show that @xmath222 then the matrix norm of the remainder integral in eq .",
    "@xmath223 on the other hand , the first term in the right side of eq .",
    "consists of two parts , the one proportional to @xmath224 , which is of the order @xmath225 , and the other proportional to @xmath216 , which is @xmath166 .",
    "then , summarizing the estimations made , we conclude that @xmath226 moreover , here , due to , we can safely replace @xmath227 by unity , and then the approximate solution of the evolution equation in the valley takes the form @xmath228 finally , by neglecting the terms of the order @xmath85 , we may write @xmath229 this expression can also be derived using mathematically strict stationary phase technique @xcite .      on the cliffs ,",
    "the change of the effective mixing angle is still of the order @xmath168 , while the spatial scale of this change is quite small . on the other hand , the change of the phase of oscillations @xmath53 , so that we can expand the exponential in the right side of eq .   in the local phase incursion @xmath230 now , using the smallness of the total variation of the mixing angle on the cliff , we obtain @xmath231 this finally leads to the cliff approximation of the evolution operator @xmath232 where @xmath233 and @xmath234      it is also useful to consider a valley @xmath235 $ ] following the cliff @xmath236 $ ] .",
    "using expressions and for the evolution operators on these segments , within the linear accuracy in @xmath92 , we obtain @xmath237 where @xmath238 , @xmath239 , and @xmath76 is defined analogously to .",
    "now , by substituting the above result into representation for the evolution operation , we arrive at @xmath240e^{-{\\mathrm{i}}\\sigma_2\\theta(x_{j}^-)}+ { \\mathit{o}}(\\eta\\delta^2 )      \\nonumber\\\\      = e^{{\\mathrm{i}}\\sigma_2\\theta(x_{j+1}^-)}e^{-{\\mathrm{i}}\\sigma_1\\dot\\theta(x_{j+1}^-)/2\\lambda } e^{{\\mathrm{i}}\\sigma_3{{\\scriptstyle\\delta}}\\psi_{j+1 } }      e^{{\\mathrm{i}}\\sigma_1\\bar\\mu_{j } } e^{-{\\mathrm{i}}\\sigma_2{{\\scriptstyle\\delta}}\\theta_{j}}e^{-{\\mathrm{i}}\\sigma_2\\theta(x_{j}^- ) } + { \\mathit{o}}(\\eta\\delta^2 ) +      { \\mathit{o}}(\\eta^2 ) , \\label{r_valley_cliff}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath241 .",
    "this expression , in turn , can be generalized to a sequence of @xmath21 valleys ( see eq .  ) .",
    "as one could see from the main flow of the paper , for the neutrinos with energies around 1  mev , the earth s crust can not be considered either a valley or a cliff , since its width is comparable with the oscillation length , and the parameter @xmath242 is of the order of unity . here , however , another approximation is useful , which takes into account the small density of the crust , as well as its bounded thickness . in terms of the parameters",
    "@xmath92 , and @xmath242 , we have @xmath243 then , using the expansion , we find the immediate expression for the evolution operator for the crust : @xmath244 where real numbers @xmath245 are defined by the expression @xmath246 note that the form of this approximation coincides with the cliff approximation , up to the coefficient substitution @xmath247 , @xmath248",
    ". in particular , the cliff approximation is restored in the @xmath249 limit .",
