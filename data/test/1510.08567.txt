    "physical layer security has attracted significant research attention recently . compared to the traditional upper - layer cryptographic techniques using secret keys , physical layer security safeguards wireless communications by directly exploiting the randomness offered by wireless channels without using secret keys , and thus has been recognized as an alternative for cryptographic techniques @xcite .",
    "the principle of physical layer security was first studied in @xcite assuming single - input single - output systems .",
    "it was shown that secrecy can only exist when the wiretap channel between the source and the eavesdropper is a degraded version of the main channel between the source and the legitimate receiver .",
    "subsequently , this result was generalized to the case where the main channel and the wiretap channel are independent @xcite .    most recently , implementing multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) techniques at the source",
    "/ legimitmate receiver has been shown to significantly improve the physical layer security of wiretap channels @xcite . in terms of mimo techniques , beamforming @xcite , artificial noise ( an ) @xcite , and",
    "transmit antenna selection @xcite are just a few techniques that can be utilized to boost the physical layer security of wiretap channels . in @xcite , it is assumed that the channel state information ( csi ) from the eavesdropper is perfectly or statistically known at the source .",
    "this assumption , however , is unlikely to be valid in practice - especially when the eavesdropper is not an authorized component of the communication system .    in this paper",
    "we propose a location - based beamforming scheme that does not require any form of csi be passed by the eavesdropper back to the source .",
    "rather , we will assume that some _ a priori _ known location information of the eavesdropper is available to the source .",
    "such a scenario can occur in many circumstances , such as those detailed in @xcite . in our scheme , we assume that _ all _ of the communication channels are in a rician fading environment",
    ". that is , the channel between the source and the legitimate receiver and the channel between the source and the eavesdropper are a combination of a line - of - sight ( los ) component _ and _ a random scattered component .",
    "we also assume that the csi from the legitimate receiver is _ perfectly _ known at the source , while the _ only _ information on the eavesdropper available at the source is her location .",
    "our key goal is to determine the beamforming vector at the source that minimizes the secrecy outage probability of the system , given the csi of the main channel and the eavesdropper s location .",
    "perhaps the most relevant work to ours is that of @xcite in which the secrecy outage probability in rician wiretap channels was investigated , largely for the case where the location of the eavesdropper was available at the source but where the csi of the main channel was unavailable . compared to @xcite",
    ", our work is different in the following main aspects : ( i ) we derive a simpler expression of the secrecy outage probability when the eavesdropper s location and the csi of the main channel are known .",
    "we highlight that our expression is valid for arbitrary values of average signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) and rician @xmath0 factors in the main channel and the wiretap channel .",
    "( ii ) based on this new expression we develop a much more efficient search algorithm for the determination of the optimal beamforming scheme that minimizes the secrecy outage probability when the csi of the main channel and the eavesdropper s location are available at the source .",
    "we highlight that our new search algorithm invokes a one - dimensional search , as opposed to the multi - dimensional searches required previously , thereby greatly reducing the computational complexity ( important for in - field deployments ) .",
    "( iii ) we examine the impact of location uncertainty on the secrecy outage probability , showing how secrecy can still exist when only a noisy estimate of the eavesdropper s location is available at the source .",
    "we consider a wiretap channel with rician fading , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ system_model ] , where alice communicates with bob in the presence of eve ( the eavesdropper ) . in this channel , alice and eve",
    "are equipped with uniform linear arrays ( ula ) with @xmath1 and @xmath2 antennas , respectively , while bob is equipped with a single antenna .",
    "we adopt the polar coordinate system . as such",
    ", the locations of alice , bob , and eve are denoted by @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "we consider that the main channel between alice and bob and the eavesdropper s channel between alice and eve are subject to quasi - static independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) rician fading with different rician @xmath0-factors .",
    "we also consider that a @xmath0-factor map ( @xmath0 as a function of location ) is known in the vicinity of alice via some _ a priori _ measurement campaign .",
    "we assume that the csi of the main channel is known to alice , while the only available information on eve is her location .",
    "this assumption is reasonable in some military application scenarios where alice can obtain eve s location through some _ a priori _ surveillance .",
    "we denote @xmath6 as the @xmath7 channel vector from alice to bob , which is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the rician @xmath0-factor of the main channel , @xmath10 denotes the los component , and @xmath11 denotes the scattered component - the elements of which are assumed to be i.i.d complex gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance , i.e. , @xmath12 . in , @xmath13 is expressed as @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the constant spacing , in wavelengths , between adjacent antennas of the ula at alice .",

    "we then express the received signal at eve as @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the thermal noise vector at eve - the elements of which are assumed to be i.i.d complex gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 . as such , we express the received snr at bob as @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "note , we assume that eve adopts maximal ratio combining ( mrc ) @xcite to process her received signal ( maximizing her snr ) . as per the rules of mrc ,",
    "the received snr at eve is expressed as @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "we first describe in detail how the optimal beamforming scheme that minimizes the secrecy outage probability is obtained by utilizing bob s csi and eve s location .",
    "we then derive an easy - to - compute expression for the secrecy outage probability when the proposed location - based beamforming scheme is applied .",
    "based on and , the achievable secrecy rate in the wiretap channel is expressed as @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the capacity of the main channel , and @xmath53 is the capacity of the eavesdropper s channel . in this wiretap channel , if @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes a given secrecy transmission rate , the perfect secrecy is guaranteed . if @xmath56 , information on the transmitted signal is leaked to eve , and the secrecy is compromised . in order to evaluate the secrecy performance of the wiretap channel in detail ,",
    "we adopt the secrecy outage probability as the performance metric - defined as the probability that the achievable secrecy rate is less than a given secrecy transmission rate conditioned on @xmath57 .",
    "mathematically , this is formulated as @xmath58 our goal is to find the optimal beamforming vector that minimizes the secrecy outage probability .",
    "that is , we wish to find @xmath59 in order to solve , we present the following proposition .",
    "[ p1 ] given @xmath60 $ ] , the optimal beamforming vector @xmath61 that minimizes the secrecy outage probability is a member of the following family of beamformer solutions , @xmath62 here , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 ; and @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "suppose that @xmath67 denotes an orthonormal basis in the complex space @xmath68 .",
    "as such , any beamforming vector at alice can be expressed as @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 $ ] are complex and @xmath71 .",
    "we first note that the achievable secrecy rate @xmath72 is a function of @xmath39 .",
    "we then note that beamforming into @xmath73 has no impact on the capacity of the main channel @xmath74 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath73 are orthogonal to the plane spanned by @xmath75 and the main channel @xmath6 lies in this plane .",
    "we also find that beamforming into @xmath73 , on the other hand , may increase the capacity of the eavesdropper s channel @xmath76 unless the eavesdropper s channel @xmath16 also lies in the plane spanned by @xmath75 .",
    "based on the above analysis , we see that beamforming into @xmath73 decreases @xmath72 or has no impact on @xmath72 . as such",
    ", we confirm that the optimal beamforming vector has the following structure , given by @xmath77 we note that @xmath78 and @xmath79 in are general phases have no impact on @xmath72 , thus without loss of generality we can set @xmath80 . substituting @xmath81 into",

    "this is due to the fact that an exhaustive search is performed in the complex space @xmath68 .",
    "consequently , the computational complexity of the exhaustive search grows exponentially as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this is to be compared with our method in proposition [ p1 ] which involves a one - dimensional search of @xmath82 only , regardless of the value of @xmath1 .",
