    "the parametric beating of a weak probe field with a prepared raman coherence in a far - off - resonance medium has been extensively studied @xcite .",

    "it has been shown that the statistical properties of the quantum probe can be replicated into the two sidebands nearest to the input line , in agreement with the experimental observations @xcite .    however , many experiments have reported the observations of ultrabroad raman spectra with a large number of sidebands @xcite . in the experiments with solid hydrogen @xcite , at least two anti - stokes sidebands and two stokes sidebands have been observed . in the experiment with molecular deuterium @xcite ,",
    "a large raman coherence @xmath0 and about 20 raman sidebands , covering a wide spectral range from near infrared through vacuum ultraviolet , have been generated . in rare - earth",
    "doped dielectrics with low raman frequency and long - lived spin coherence , a substantial raman coherence @xmath1 and an extremely large number of sidebands ( about @xmath2 ) can also be generated @xcite .",

    "the timing and alignment of these fields are such that they substantially overlap with each other during the interaction process .",
    "the driving laser fields are tuned close to the raman transition @xmath13 , with a small finite two - photon detuning @xmath14 , but are far detuned from the upper electronic states @xmath15 of the molecules .",
    "we assume that all the frequency components of the input probe field are separated by integer multiples of the raman modulation frequency @xmath16 .",
    "the driving fields adiabatically produce a raman coherence @xmath17 @xcite . when the probe field propagates through the medium , it beats with the prepared raman coherence .",
    "since the probe field is weak and short compared to the driving fields , the medium state and the driving fields do not change substantially during this step .",
    "the beating of the probe field with the prepared raman coherence leads to the generation of new sidebands in the total output field @xmath18 .",

    "however , the two mechanisms are very different in physical nature .",
    "the most important difference between them is that the two fields from the conventional beam splitter have the same frequency while the sideband fields in the raman scheme have different frequencies .",
    "in addition , the model hamiltonian ( [ 8b ] ) involves an infinitely large number of raman sidebands , separated by integer multiples of the raman modulation frequency @xmath48 . despite these differences , the model ( [ 8b ] )",

    "the normalized @xmath73th - order autocorrelation functions of the sidebands are defined by @xmath93 .",
    "these functions characterize the overall statistical properties , such as sub - poissonian , poissonian , or super - poissonian photon statistics , regardless of the mean photon number . unlike the mean photon number @xmath84 and the autocorrelation function @xmath85 ,",

    "such a replication of the normalized autocorrelation characteristics can be called autocorrelation multiplexing . in particular ,",

    "it is not surprising that the normalized autocorrelation functions of the probe field are replicated into the sidebands in the parametric beating process .",
    "such a replication is possible because the medium is far off resonance and the quantum probe field is weak compared to the driving fields . under these two conditions ,",
    "the photon annihilation operators are linearly transformed as described by the linear differential equation ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "this equation shows that the photon annihilation operators are not mixed up with the creation operators , and therefore the evolution of the annihilation operators is linear with respect to the initial annihilation operators .",
    "we should , however , emphasize here that the replication of all of the normalized autocorrelation functions @xmath97 ( for all orders @xmath73 ) of the input field does not mean the replication of the quantum state @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , the oscillations of the mean photon number @xmath84 and the autocorrelation function @xmath85 indicate that the photon - number distributions and consequently the quantum states of the sidebands evolve in a rather complicated way and are quite different from those for the input field",

    "it has also been shown that , when the input field is prepared in a thermal state , the reduced state of each generated sideband is also a thermal state .",

    "the two systems have the same underlying physics : the fields are linearly transformed from the input values",
    ". however , the two systems are different in their natures . unlike the conventional beam splitter",
    ", the multiorder coherent raman process can efficiently produce a broad comb of sideband fields whose frequencies are different and are separated by integer multiples of the raman modulation frequency .",
    "the number of generated raman sidebands increases with the effective medium length , which is proportional to the product of the medium length and the prepared raman coherence .",
    "the bessel functions of the effective medium length play a similar role as the transmission and reflection coefficients of a conventional beam splitter .",
    "the ability of the far - off - resonance raman medium to generate a broad comb of fields with similar quantum statistical properties and to switch the quantum statistical characteristics of the radiation fields from one type to another type may find useful applications for high - performance optical communication networks .",
    "in addition , two - photon interference in coherent raman scattering may find various applications for high - precision measurements and also for quantum computation .    finally , we emphasize that the coupling between the raman sidebands can be controlled by the magnitude of the prepared raman coherence , that is , by the intensities of the driving fields . in a realistic far - off - resonance raman medium , such as molecular hydrogen or deuterium vapor @xcite , solid hydrogen @xcite , and rare - earth",
    "doped dielectrics @xcite , a large raman coherence and , consequently , a large number of raman sidebands can be generated by the two - color adiabatic pumping technique .",
    "in such a system , the generation of a broad comb of high - order raman sidebands with nonclassical statistical properties is , in principle , feasible .",
