    "the covering fraction is lower for the virgo galaxies , @xmath30 , than for the field galaxies , @xmath31 , within 300 kpc with the velocity interval @xmath15200(400 ) .",
    "the covering fractions outside 300 kpc are indistinguishable from each other , but at this distance , we are no longer tracing the cgm within a galaxy s virial radius .    in figure  [ f3.fig ]",
    ", we separate the virgo galaxies into those within  ( cluster environment ) and outside  ( circumcluster environment ; see section  [ data.sec ] ) . as in figure",
    "[ f2.fig ] , we examine the data in 100 and 300 kpc bins .",
    "the covering fraction for galaxies outside  with @xmath32 is consistent with the p11 galaxies as shown in the upper right panel .",
    "this indicates that the difference seen in the previous plots are due to galaxies within .",
    "indeed , predominantly using the 300 kpc bins ( bottom row ) , the galaxies outside  ( solid line with squares ) show a higher @xmath33 than those within  ( long - dashed line with triangles ) , @xmath34 , within 300 kpc . with 100 kpc bins ,",
    "there is a rise at 0 - 100 kpc for galaxies within  with both velocity intervals .",
    "we thoroughly investigated this rise and found that it is due to galaxies in virgo s infalling substructures which are described in y12 and references within .",
    "this is also the case for the increase in the @xmath35 kpc bin with @xmath36 ( see section  [ discussion.sec ] for details ) .",
    "these contaminating galaxies are few and therefore the effect of the substructures is lessened in the 300 kpc bin plot .    .",
    "previous studies detected absorption lines within @xmath37 kpc of galaxies in almost all cases @xcite .",
    "although the galaxies in these studies include some group members @xcite , the vast majority of the galaxies are not in an environment as dense as the virgo cluster .",
    "we have shown that the cgm properties vary with the virgo and field environments .",
    "the galaxies in the virgo environment do not show the @xmath22 anti - correlation seen for the field and p11 galaxies . also , the covering fraction of the cgm for the virgo environment galaxies is lower than that of the field / p11 galaxies within 300 kpc .",
    "p11 used the number of neighbors to claim that their derived cgm properties are independent of local environment ; this does not seem to be the case when the cluster environment is probed .",
    "our results are consistent with @xcite who found a lower for group galaxies ( 0.57 ) than field galaxies ( 1.00 ) with @xmath38 .",
    "their covering fraction for group galaxies is between our cluster galaxies ( 0.39 ) and circumcluster galaxies ( 0.78 ) .",
    "another recent study found the cgm is present around early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "we performed visual classification of our galaxy - upper limit pairs and find that early - type galaxies within  do not show any associated absorbers .",
    "therefore , our results indicate that the presence of the cgm around early - type galaxies is determined not by galaxy type , but by environment .",
    "a dense environment is playing an important role in suppressing the cgm .",
    "disk gas stripping by a cluster environment has been observed in many previous studies .",
    "for instance , @xcite found gas being stripped from galaxy disks at @xmath39 mpc in the virgo cluster ( virgo  @xmath2 mpc ) . since the cgm is more diffuse than disk gas , and more loosely bound , it is more vulnerable to stripping",
    ". gas stripping by ram pressure will occur if @xmath40 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* modified by @xcite ) where @xmath41 is the icm density , @xmath42 is the relative velocity of a galaxy to the icm , @xmath43 is the column density of the galaxy s gas , @xmath44 is the rotation velocity of a galaxy , and @xmath45 is the radius of a galaxy . for the cgm , we assume the parameters as follows : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 kpc , and @xmath49 as a representative value for ram pressure stripping in the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "then , the icm density required to cause cgm stripping is @xmath50 .",
    "this icm density is many orders of magnitude lower than the representative density of the icm for ram pressure in the virgo cluster , which is @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "therefore , ram pressure stripping of the cgm will occur earlier than disk gas stripping and in an environment that is not dense enough to remove disk gas .",
    "the truncation of the cgm for the cluster galaxies can be attributed to either the rapid integration of stripped gas into the icm or the lack of the accretion of warm gas . while fast integration of stripped gas to the icm is investigated in theoretical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gas accretion onto a galaxy in different environments still remains to be probed . in any case",
    ", the cgm truncation removes future fuel for star formation and will cause a galaxy to evolve onto the red sequence through a process called _ starvation _ @xcite .",
    "starvation is expected to begin around the cluster virial radius by stripping outer halo gas in simulations @xcite .",
    "our results provide observational evidence for this starvation .",
    "we do not see the effect of cgm stripping in the circumcluster environment as the covering fraction of the cgm for the circumcluster galaxies is in agreement with that of the field and p11 galaxies .",
    "further studies should attempt to examine at what radii the cgm is stripped as a galaxy enters a cluster given the low densities required to strip the cgm .",
    "this may be more straightforward to investigate in a more regular cluster than virgo which has numerous infalling substructures .",
    "the cgm may be protected in the circumcluster environment by the fact that the galaxies are moving with the igm into the cluster ( see y12 ) .",
    "we see somewhat of an increase in within 100 kpc and @xmath35 kpc in the top left panel ( @xmath36 ) of figure  [ f3.fig ] even for the galaxies within .",
    "the increase within 100 kpc is also seen in the @xmath32 panel ( right ) . given the typical lack of absorbers within , it is interesting to examine the reason for these increases .",
    "the uncertainty in the distance estimates , as explained in section  [ data.sec ] , may play somewhat of a role .",
    "for instance , though most things remain very similar , the rise at @xmath35 kpc disappears when velocities instead of distances are used to define cluster galaxies .",
    "most of the galaxy - absorber pairs causing the increase can be linked back to virgo substructures that are infalling or are thought to have fairly recently fallen in .",
    "cluster b is one of the main culprits .",
    "cluster b is within the virial radius of the cluster in projection and at the same distance as the main cluster @xcite ; however , it contains many gas - rich galaxies and is thought to be an in - fallen structure ( see y12 for more details ) .",
    "one other particularly interesting galaxy - absorber pair within   is in the vicinity of the subcluster containing m86 .",
    "the pair is @xmath52 kpc in projection from m86 and not far in position - velocity space from a long tail of atomic hydrogen and h@xmath53 emission that is connected to m86 @xcite .",
    "the m86 subcluster may have recently fallen into virgo from the backside and the tail is thought to be stripped gas residing within the cluster @xcite .",
    "by examining galaxies and absorbers in cluster , circumcluster , and field environments , we find the following .    1 .   the typical anti - correlation between impact parameter and a equivalent width is not found for the virgo galaxies and absorbers .",
    "2 .   the cgm covering fraction for virgo galaxies is lower than that of field galaxies . in particular , galaxies within the virial radius of the cluster show a lower , while galaxies in the circumcluster environment have a comparable to field galaxies .",
    "the results indicate the cluster environment suppresses the cgm , and that the presence of a warm cgm depends not on galaxy type , but on environment .",
    "the cgm can be easily suppressed by gas stripping processes in the cluster environment ( e.g. , ram pressure ) ; however , the prevention of gas accretion to individual galaxies may also play a role .",
    "this removal of the cgm will result in starvation , and quench star formation .",
    "further studies of cgm variation with environment will provide additional insight into the link between the surrounding igm , the cgm , and galaxies .",
