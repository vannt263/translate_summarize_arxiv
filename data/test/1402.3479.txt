    "identifying members of known moving groups ( mg ) or open clusters can provide an important constraint on their age and composition . low - mass stars and brown dwarfs ( bds ) members of known mgs or open clusters can provide important feedback to atmospheric and evolutionary models of such objects at young ages , which currently await good calibration from constraints on age and composition .",
    "therefore , there exists an imperative to compile a sample of mg members in this mass range that can be used as anchor points or test - beds for these models .    in this paper",
    "we present the last in a series of results of a major survey of ultra - cool dwarfs ( ucds ; objects with a spectral classification of m7 or later corresponding to teff@xmath12500 k ) , in young moving groups which began with the results presented in clarke et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , hereafter paper i , and glvez - ortiz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , hereafter paper ii .",
    "we focus here on the study of age - sensitive spectroscopic signatures such as gravity sensitive features ( e.g. gorlova et al .",
    "2003 ; mcgovern et al . 2004 ) , h@xmath0 emission ( e.g. west et al . 2004 , 2008 , 2011 ) and the presence of li  i 6708   in a sample of objects previously classified as members of a mg based on kinematic or astrometric criteria .",
    "despite the recent disagreement about the origin of moving groups ( famaey et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ; antoja et al . 2008 ; klement et al . 2008 ; francis & anderson 2009 ; zhao et al . 2009 ; lpez - santiago et al . 2009 ; bovy & hogg 2010 ; murgas et al .",
    "2013 ) , and as we discussed in paper ii , we are assuming the classical concept : a moving group is a young stellar population that shares a common space motion ( e.g. pinfield et al .",
    "2006 ) whose members have a common origin , and therefore , age and composition .",
    "we focused our studies on well - documented groups : the hyades supercluster ( hy ; 600 myr ) , the ursa major group ( sirius supercluster ) ( si ; 300 myr ) , ic 2391 supercluster ( ic ; 35 - 55 myr ) , the castor moving group ( ca ; 200 myr ) , and the local association ( 20 - 150 myr ) or pleiades ( pl ) moving group ( see paper i and ii for details of mg properties and references thereof ) .",
    "many efforts have been made to obtain accurate models to understand the cool and complex atmospheres of low mass stellar and substellar objects ( e.g. kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1993 ; rajpurohit et al .",
    "2011 ; reyle et al .",
    "2011 ; rajpurohit et al .",
    "but the models still show discrepancies , for example in the strength of some absorption bands : discrepancies likely due to inaccurate atomic parameters and/or missing molecular opacities .",
    "also , dust formation and its behaviour with temperature changes spectral characteristics in many ways .",
    "models that describe very low - mass stars ( vlms ) and bd atmospheres can not hope to be in agreement with observations without the inclusion of dust . the onset of iron and silicates dust grain formation suspended in the photospheres of late - type m dwarfs through the l dwarf spectral sub - types is accompanied by spectral reddening , especially in near - ir ( based upon the size , quantity and distribution of this dust ) .",
    "the t dwarf spectral sub - type sequence demonstrates a reversal to bluer colours due to the dust settling below the photosphere , thus reducing the reddening .",
    "consequently , atmospheric models that describe dwarf objects with t@xmath2 @xmath3 2800 k should include treatment for the effects of atmospheric dust evolution .",
    "up to date , there are several families of stellar model atmospheres of very low mass stars .",
    "these models are still incomplete or approximate in some physical properties ( opacities , oscillator strengths for some lines and molecular bands , etc ) , showing few or considerable discrepancies depending on the atmospheric regions , temperatures , etc , and there are also non covered areas or `` gaps '' . a comprehensive study of models tested by observations is needed to fully understand this cool atmospheres .",
    "since bds are objects occupying an intermediate position between stars and giant planets , studying their atmospheres can help us to better understand the processes in giant exo - planet atmospheres .",
    "the determination of the physical properties of vlms and bds is also important for understanding a broad range of topics including stellar and planetary formation , circumstellar disks , dust formation in cool atmospheres , and the initial mass function .    by comparing high and low resolution optical spectra of our 25 low - mass stars and",
    "bd kinematic mg candidates with a grid of atmospheric models , we can obtain effective temperature and surface gravity estimates .    in section  2",
    "we describe the sample characteristics and selection criteria , while in section  3 we present details of our observations and data reduction techniques . in section  4",
    "we explain the model atmosphere fitting process , and in section  5 we describe the age indicators and the analysis used to assess the sample memberships .",
    "finally , in section  6 we present a brief discussion and summary of our results .",
    "we present here the study of two different samples .      we used photometric and astrometric criteria to combine an extended version of the liverpool - edinburgh high proper motion survey ( elehpm ; pokorny , jones & hambly 2003 ; pokorny et al .",
    "2004 ) and southern infrared proper motion survey ( sips ; deacon et al . 2005 ; deacon & hambly 2007 ) with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , and applied colour cuts of @xmath4-@xmath5@xmath61.0 and @xmath7-@xmath5@xmath65.0 to select objects with spectral type predominantly later than m6v . to these we applied proper motion restriction , @xmath8@xmath9 ( @xmath10 is proper motion and @xmath11 is the proper motion one sigma uncertainty ) to ensure a 4-@xmath12 level of proper motion accuracy before searching for stars with proper motions consistent with any of the mgs .",
    "of the 817 red object catalogue we obtained by using both astrometric and photometric criteria , we concluded that 132 of these objects were possible members of one or more of the five mgs in the study ( see paper i for details ) .    from this sample",
    "we then obtained high resolution spectra of 68 objects with spectral types ranging m4.5-l1 . using these high resolution",
    "spectra we derived galactic space - velocity components and , applied a simple kinematic criterion .",
    "we found that 49 targets have kinematics consistent with the young disk population ( yd ; see e.g. eggen 1984a , b , 1989 ) and that 36 of them possibly belong to one of the five moving groups in this study .",
    "we also measured ( where possible ) projected rotational velocities and used the rotation rate as a supporting criterion of youth in confirming the kinematic members .",
    "we found that 31 young disk candidates have moderately high rotational velocities which also suggest youth and that 12 others have significantly high rotations to consider for further investigation as possible young stars ( see paper ii for details ) .",
    "we present here high resolution follow - up observations for the 13 brightest stars in this sample , that we took in order to use other spectroscopic age criteria to confirm kinematic membership . in table  [ tab : samplea ] we give the name , coordinates , 2mass @xmath4 magnitude and the mg candidature assigned from the kinematic study and the rotational velocities obtained in paper ii .",

    "this difference is marked by the systematic assignment of a later spectral type by the photometric method .",
    "also the difference between the two classifications appears greater for redder objects . even with care during selection , the objects of sample b are situated in highly populated and reddened areas within the photometric selection planes , which could have produced these differences .",
    "also , the possible presence of dust in these atmospheres could account for redder colours , therefore suggesting later spectral types .",
    "we used the spectral types derived from spectroscopy for all calculations .",
    "for this paper we analysed optical high resolution echelle spectra of 13 objects ( sample a ; table  [ tab : samplea ] ) and low resolution long slit spectra of 12 objects ( sample b ; table  [ tab : sampleb ] ) .",
    "the data were obtained during four observing runs detailed in table  [ tab : obs ] .    both sets of high and low resolution spectra",
    "were extracted using the standard reduction procedures in the iraf twodspec and echelle packages respectively : bias subtraction , flat - field division , extraction of the spectra , telluric correction as well as wavelength and flux calibration .",

    "to determine spectral characteristics of the targets ( t@xmath2 , @xmath31 , etc ) , to aid us in age determination , we compared a grid of generated synthetic spectra with the observations .",
    "according to current concepts , dust plays an important role in the formation of late m dwarf spectra ( tsuji et al .",
    "1996 ; hauschildt & allard 1992 ) .",

    "the artificial rotational - broadening of spectral lines was implemented following the methodology of gray ( 2005 ) using the rotational velocity of the objects obtained in paper ii .",
    "we carried out a few numerical experiments to investigate the effect of microturbulence velocity on the spectra .",
    "the study shows that the differences in synthetic spectra associated with @xmath35 in the 1.0 - 5.0 km s@xmath36 range are negligible .",
    "thus all theoretical spectra were computed for a microturbulence velocity @xmath35 = 3.0 km s@xmath36 .",
    "we used the semi - empirical atmospheric models described in pavlenko et al .",
    "( 2007a ) to include the effects of dust formation .",
    "the semi - empirical models were obtained by modifying nextgen , dusty and cond models .",
    "the dust opacity originates in the shell - like structures lying above the photosphere ( pavlenko et al .",
    "2007a ) and we expect the influence of dust in a spectrum to be more prevalent in the shortest wavelength spectral region .",
    "we assumed that dust clouds are located in the upper most layers of stellar atmosphere and do not affect the distribution of temperatures and pressures .",
    "dusty effects were treated in two ways : ( 1 ) decreasing molecular abundance in the gas due to molecular condensation of dust particles and ( 2 ) radiation scattering in the dust clouds .",
    "the decrease in the concentration of tio and vo molecules was modelled by two parameters : ( 1 ) the number of layers in the above model for which there is no absorption of tio ( i.e. , all titanium oxide condenses on dust particles ) and ( 2 ) the coefficient of tio molecular density reduction for all other model layers .",
    "radiation scattering in the dust clouds was also modelled by two parameters : 1 ) the optical thickness of the dust cloud and 2 ) the location of maximum opacity as a result of these clouds .",

    "2001 ) atmospheric models for the study of the late m dwarfs synthetic spectra .",
    "the dusty and cond models were modified in an identical way to the model improvements for early m dwarfs : we introduced additional scattering of radiation by dust clouds and reduced the abundance of the molecules tio and vo .",

    "pressure broadening is calculated using two methods : a collisional approximation ( van der waals theory ) and quasi - static theory ( see burrows & volobuyev 2003 ; allard et al .",
    "the use of a collision approximation allows us to describe the profiles of metal lines in early m dwarfs .",
    "the quasi - static theory is used in the study of l dwarfs , where energy levels of atomic sodium or potassium are immersed in a sea of molecular hydrogen and are subsequently perturbed by the potential field of the diatomic hydrogen .",

    "sips0007 - 2458 , a candidate member of the ic2391 mg , shows positive candidature under most criteria but does not show the expected lithium ( associated with the age of the ic2391 mg ) . due to the age constraint from @xmath60 emission and surface gravity , we are inclined to think that sips0007 - 2458 is probably a young object from the yd class , but is not in the ic2391 mg , although it could also be a contaminant field object .",
    "2mass0334 - 2130 is a similar case , with an m4.5 - 6 spectral type , it should contain lithium if it were an ic2391 mg member .",
    "except for the @xmath60 criterion , that could be reflecting a maximum in activity level or the influence of an unseen companion , everything indicates that 2mass0334 - 2130 is older than the ic2391 mg .",
    "thus we also conclude that 2mass0334 - 2130 is not an ic2391 member , although it could be a young object from the yd , or a contaminant target from the field .    in sample b , 10 objects could be mg members , although more information is needed to discriminate between the possible mg membership of objects with several candidatures .",
    "we could not obtain any results for 2mass1909 - 1937 , so this remains an astrometric candidate to the castor mg .",
    "2mass1734 - 1151 gave contradictory results so it also remains an astrometric pleiades mg candidate until further analysis can be performed .",
    "we also confirm two moving group candidates , sips2045 - 6332 and sips2039 - 1126 , as bds .    with all the acquired information , we find that 85% , 83% and 84% of samples a , b , and both combined , show spectroscopic signatures of youth in agreement with the age of the moving group to which they present kinematic membership .",
    "this result suggests that there is a fairly low rate of contamination in such kinematic candidate samples . also , there are candidates that can not be confirmed or dismissed with the information obtained , which might ( in the future ) increase the final confirmation rate .",
    "we note that additional diagnostics to assess membership may be measured in the future , such as chemical tagging .",
    "recently , in a kinematical - chemical investigation of the ab dor moving group `` stream '' , barenfeld et al .",
    "( 2013 ) shows that kinematics , color - magnitude positions , and stellar youth indicators alone can be insufficient for testing whether a kinematic group of stars actually shares a common origin .",
    "future chemical study of our mg candidates will complement this study .",
    "in addition , this study has also helped to test and improve the atmosphere models for cool dwarfs ( see kuznetsov et al .",
    "2012 and kuznetsov et al .",
    "youth can be an advantage for various reasons .",
    "because young objects are brighter they can be detected and studied out to greater distance than older , fainter objects .",
    "also , the proximity of the mgs can allows the exploration of the faint circumstellar environment at relatively small distances from the star .",
    "indeed , we will target our strongest mg candidates to search for lower mass companions using high resolution imaging techniques ( e.g. adaptive optics ) .",
    "the discovery of planetary systems around young and low - mass objects provides crucial information for the understanding of planetary and stellar formation .    from our complete study of the 80 objects considered ( within papers i , ii and this paper ) , we have found a total of 45 new possible mg members ( with 8 of them showing more than one mg candidature ) and around 21 possible young disk objects with no clear membership of the 5 mgs considered .    of these",
    "we find 26 , 13 , 6 , 4 and 5 possible members of the hyades , castor , ursa major , pleiades and ic2391 mgs respectively .",
