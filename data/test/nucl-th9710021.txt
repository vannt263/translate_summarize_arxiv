    "it is universally accepted that nucleons are composite objects made out of quarks , and that it will eventually be necessary to include this substructure in order to successfully model all properties of nuclei and nuclear matter . for many years",
    "now there has been a program of modelling the nucleon as being primarily composed of three light relativistic quarks bound together in a localised spherical region by a mean field generated by their mutual interaction .",
    "such soliton models have the advantage over their precursor , the mit bag , that the structure is fully dynamical , and so its response to external probes can be calculated consistently .",
    "apart from the calculation of the properties of static , isolated nucleons , one of the earliest applications of soliton models was to nuclear matter .",
    "there are two main ways in which this has been done .",
    "one , which was started later but has been taken further , involves modelling the effect of the presence of other nucleons on a test nucleon by constant background fields , typically the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons which play such an important role in quantum hadrodynamics @xcite . since these background fields will modify the soliton structure , which in turn will change the meson - nucleon coupling constants , the value of the fields for a given density can be calculated self - consistently .",
    "such calculations may well capture the essential physics at low densities . at nuclear matter densities , however , the inter - nucleon separation is very comparable to the nucleon radius .",
    "if soliton models , in which the quark profiles fall to zero smoothly as a function of distance from the centre , are to be taken seriously , then the quark wavefunctions of different nucleons must overlap significantly . the other approach to soliton matter",
    "treats this as the dominant effect @xcite .",
    "if nuclear matter were crystalline , we would know how to tackle the problem .",
    "single quark energy levels would be replaced by bloch wavefunctions , satisfying @xmath2 for lattice vectors @xmath3 . by concentrating on a single cell",
    "the bloch condition gives boundary conditions on the wavefunction within that cell for all values of the crystal momentum @xmath4 within the first brillouin zone , with the lowest energy state corresponding to @xmath5 and an energy gap above the highest energy state .",
    "it is therefore possible to start with an approximate form of the potential , find a sufficient set of states to enable the quark density to be integrated over the band , solve for the potential generated by these quarks and then iterate until convergence is reached . while simple in principle , this would be a formidable task in practice , since the potential and wavefunctions will contain all spherical harmonics and the integration in @xmath4-space is three - dimensional .",
    "the closest to realising this program which has been achieved so far was also the earliest such study .",
    "achtzehnter  @xcite used the friedberg - lee model on a face - centred cubic lattice .",
    "however they calculated states and energies for only one direction in @xmath4-space , and assumed that the dispersion relation was the same in all directions , thereby simplifying the calculation of the quark density .",
    "however nuclear matter has no long - range crystalline order .",
    "this fact , coupled with a desire for a less cumbersome calculational method , inspired the approach that has been taken ever since , namely the use of the wigner - seitz approximation @xcite . in their first paper wigner and seitz",
    "were concerned with the energy of the bottom of the band in sodium .",
    "they made the assumption that within the cell the potential is spherically symmetric , and also that the polyhedral cell boundary is well approximated by a sphere .",
    "the schrdinger wavefunction for the state at the bottom of the band will therefore be spherically symmetric and be flat on the boundary .",
    "( for dirac wavefunctions , those become the conditions on the upper component . )",
    "these assumptions seem particularly suitable for soliton matter , which is not crystalline , since they do not depend on any particular lattice , but instead reflect the average isotropy of a liquid . for a full calculation , however , it is not enough to have the bottom of the band ; the wavefunctions of all states in the band are required .",
    "most authors in the field of soliton matter have assumed that all the states in the band are also are @xmath6-wave states ( surprisingly , since the bloch condition is strongly anisotropic for non - zero @xmath4 ) so that the dispersion relation is independent of direction .",
    "they then made a variety of assumptions about the form of the dispersion relation and the position of the top of the band .",
    "birse  @xcite for instance took the top to be the state for which the upper component of the dirac wavefunction vanishes at the cell boundary . between these two states",
    "the dispersion relation was assumed to be a sinusoid , with @xmath7 at the bottom and top of the band .",
    "the quark density was built up by sampling the full band .",
    "another assumption used has been that the width of the band is twice the difference between the energy of the isolated soliton and the energy of the bottom of the band defined as above @xcite .",
    "a third is to assume that the dispersion relation is given by @xmath8 , with the top of the band given by @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the last assumption is also used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , following wigner and seitz s second paper , they write @xmath10 , and then assume that @xmath11 .",
    "wigner and seitz carefully checked this assumption  which is clearly not exact since the equation for @xmath12 depends on @xmath4and found that for sodium , where the quadratic dispersion relation reflects the fact that the electrons are nearly free , the approximation was a good one . for well - separated solitons , in which the quarks remain clearly localised and the dispersion relation is likely to show pronounced flattening at the top of the band , it is unlikely to hold .",
    "some authors have simplified still further by allowing only the states at the top or bottom of the band to be occupied .",
    "the problem with all these approaches is that the algorithm for finding the top of the band is completely ad - hoc .",
    "furthermore the contribution of the quarks to the energy of the cell , proportional to @xmath13 , is dominated by the higher states , and so the results for the dependence of the energy on density are extremely sensitive to the assumptions used .",
    "none of the studies performed so far can thus be regarded as reliable guides to physics .",
    "the current work was motivated by the desire to retain the strengths of the wigner - seitz approach , namely the lack of dependence on a particular lattice structure and the recognition of the approximately spherically - symmetric environment of the nucleon , but in a fashion that allows the band structure to be calculated self - consistently .",
    "we therefore propose to retain a bloch - like boundary condition to relate the values of the wavefunction at any pair of antipodal points for points on the boundary @xmath14 , ( ) = e^2i(- ) , .",
    "[ bc ] the closer to spherical the brillouin zone for a particular lattice is , the closer this is to the normal bloch condition .",
    "essentially this is the logical continuation of the wigner - seitz method .",
    "furthermore this boundary condition is also satisfied by a plane wave of momentum @xmath4 , and so it also holds for the quark plasma state which will be the lowest energy state at high densities . for a band based on an @xmath6-wave state ,",
    "this gives the same condition for the bottom of the band , @xmath15 , as was used previously , namely the vanishing of the lower component at the cell boundary ( being a @xmath16-wave , the lower component is odd under @xmath17 ) .",
    "however for a given spherical potential this condition can be solved for any @xmath4 .",
    "if the potential is sufficiently deep , this gives a dispersion relation @xmath18 which turns over at a certain value of @xmath19 ; this point , at which @xmath20 , is naturally taken as the top of the band .",
    "( the dispersion relation is of course isotropic . )",
    "the band based on the next state ( with a radial node in the isolated wavefunction ) will not overlap with the lowest band , and so there is a band gap .",
    "the wavefunctions will not of course be spherically symmetric , except at the bottom of the band , and so are taken as sums over partial waves . however the quark density , integrated over the direction as well as the magnitude of @xmath4 , _ is _ spherically symmetric , and so can be used to generate a new spherically symmetric potential ; the process is repeated until convergence is reached .",
    "this is the first fully self - consistent calculation of soliton matter to be reported .",
    "there are physical effects which have not been taken into account in this calculation ; spurious centre of mass energy has not been subtracted nor energy due to fermi motion of the nucleons added , and the effects of one - gluon exchange or meson clouds apart from those which form the soliton have not been included  the effects which split the nucleon from the delta are absent .",
    "this is not yet a realistic model of nuclear matter , but it is a better starting point than any proposed so far .",
    "two models have been used in the current work : the friedberg - lee model and the chiral quark - meson model , which we will introduce briefly in turn .",
    "the friedberg - lee model @xcite is the prototypical soliton model , consisting only of quarks and a single scalar field , @xmath0 , which couples linearly to the quarks . the potential for the @xmath0 has an absolute minimum at a non - zero value of @xmath0 , @xmath21 , which is the value the field takes in the vacuum , but in the presence of a scalar quark density the minimum of the effective potential is pushed closer to zero . while quarks can exist as free particles , with a mass @xmath22 , it will be energetically favourable for three quarks to be localised in space in a  bag \" of lower @xmath0 ; this is a soliton .",
    "the lagrangian is as follows : = ( i^_-g)+_^-u ( ) , where @xmath23 , and results will be presented for the case @xmath24 , @xmath25  @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , giving @xmath29  @xmath30 and @xmath31  @xmath26 . for these parameters",
    "the isolated soliton has an isoscalar r.m.s .",
    "radius of 0.83  fm , and energy of 1265  mev .",
    "the friedberg - lee model lacks chiral symmetry .",
    "this can be restored by making the @xmath0 field the chiral partner of the pion potential .",
    "this chiral quark - meson model was introduced by birse and banerjee @xcite and by kahana  @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian is = ( i^_+g(+i_5 ) ) + _ ^ + _ ^-u ( , ) , where @xmath32 is the mexican hat ( wine - bottle ) potential , quadratic in @xmath33 , plus a small symmetry breaking term linear in @xmath0 which gives explicit chiral symmetry breaking and a non - zero pion mass . unlike the f - l model ,",
    "for which soliton formation is independent of the spin - isospin structure of the quarks , which may therefore be taken to be in the appropriate su(6 ) wavefunction , spherical solutions in the chiral model require all three quarks to be in a ",
    "hedgehog \" configuration , @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath0 field is radially symmetric , and the pion fields have their isospin vector pointing radially outwards , @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting soliton is a superposition of all states with equal spin and isospin , namely the nucleon , delta and higher resonances .",
    "states of good spin and isospin must be projected out , by cranking or other methods .",
    "it is far from clear how to do this for a soliton in matter , and we here deal only with hedgehog matter in this model .",
    "we use parameters in the potential which give @xmath36  mev , @xmath37  mev and @xmath38  mev , and take @xmath39 , which gives a soliton energy of @xmath40  mev .",
    "for each cell radius , @xmath41 , a self - consistent solution was obtained , consisting of a spherically symmetric @xmath0 field subject to the boundary condition @xmath42 and quarks in states characterised by the crystal momentum @xmath4 , satisfying the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) , with states evenly distributed throughout a sphere in @xmath4-space of radius @xmath43 , @xmath43 being the top of the band .",
    "as stressed in the introduction , the dispersion relation @xmath18 and @xmath43 are themselves calculated self - consistently . if the pion field is present , its odd parity leads to the boundary condition @xmath44 .",
    "details of the calculation are as follows .",
    "we start with an isolated soliton , in order to have a good approximation to the potential at large radii , and after a converged solution is found for each radius its potential is used as the initial guess for a smaller radius ; thus we work inwards until the solution is finally lost .",
    "the quark scalar density is found as follows for the f - l model .",
    "the hedgehog ansatz introduces some complications which are covered in the appendix . for a given potential , the bottom of the band is easily found by solving the dirac equation for the @xmath6-wave state subject to the condition that the lower component vanishes at @xmath45 . in order to have what turns out from experience to be an upper limit on the energy of the top of the band , it is useful also to find the energy of the state for which the upper component vanishes at @xmath41 .",
    "the true top is typically about half way between the bottom and this upper limit .",
    "the wavefunction for non - zero @xmath4 will not be spherically symmetric , but a superposition of states of all angular momenta ; it proves sufficient in practice to include the first 14 states .",
    "since the boundary condition is independent of spin and axially symmetric , states with spin projection parallel and antiparallel to @xmath4 have the same energy ; we need only consider one of them and allow for spin and isospin degeneracy separately .",
    "thus , taking @xmath46 , we use for our trial state _ k()=_i^l _",
    "d _ ( u_,(r)i v_,(r ) ) ^ _ ( , ) . [ wavefn ] the quantum number @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) gives the total angular momentum , @xmath49 and the orbital angular momentum of the upper component , @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 ; @xmath54 corresponds to the @xmath6-wave state .",
    "the @xmath55 are spin - orbit functions of spin-@xmath56 and orbital angular momentum @xmath57 coupled up to @xmath58 : ^m_=_m_l , m_s l_m_lm_s|j_my_l^m_l_m_s , and satisfy the relation @xmath59 .",
    "the sum in ( [ wavefn ] ) is over all the eigenstates of angular momentum of a given energy @xmath60 in the potential ( @xmath60 can be chosen at will because the only boundary condition imposed on each partial wave is that the wavefunction is regular at the origin . )",
    "the power of @xmath61 is extracted to make the coefficients @xmath62 real .",
    "the radial functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 satisfy the dirac equations @xmath65    the wavefunction ( [ wavefn ] ) , with an arbitrarily chosen energy , will not satisfy the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) for an arbitrary @xmath19 .",
    "however for any @xmath19 there will be an energy for which the boundary condition is satisfied , and conversely for a given energy , if it is not in a band gap , there will be a corresponding value of @xmath19 .",
    "finding the correspondence determines the dispersion relation @xmath18 .",
    "this was done as follows .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) can be rewritten e^-ikr ( r,,)-e^ikr ( r,- , + ) = 0 .",
    "the exponentials can be expanded in terms of legendre polynomials and spherical bessel functions , and we substitute in the form ( [ wavefn ] ) for @xmath66 . if we multiply by the spherical harmonic @xmath67 , for any @xmath68 and @xmath69 or @xmath70 , and integrate over solid angle , we obtain an equation for a linear combination of the coefficients @xmath62 .",
    "the set of these can be written as a matrix equation as follows , where the rows of the matrix are labelled by @xmath71 : _ _ ( l , m)d_=0 , where _ ( l , m)(k,)= * m*_(l , m)(k ) \\ { v_,(r ) u_,(r ) } \\ { . and @xmath72    numerically , if we truncate the expansion of the wavefunction at @xmath73 terms , we use only the first @xmath74 values of @xmath68 , giving a @xmath75 matrix .",
    "this matrix equation can hold for non - trivial @xmath62 only if det@xmath76 .",
    "in practice we search for the value of @xmath19 which gives a vanishing determinant for a given @xmath60 .",
    "the top of the band , @xmath43 , corresponds to the highest value of @xmath60 for which such a @xmath19 can be found .",

    "solid curve : a sinusoidal fit to the data points . dashed curve : the dispersion relation @xmath77 as assumed in refs  @xcite .",
    "having found the dispersion relation for @xmath4 along the @xmath78-axis , we know from spherical symmetry that it will be the same in any other direction .",
    "a simple rotation serves to produce the corresponding wavefunctions .",
    "the full scalar density is then spherically symmetric , and is given in terms of the @xmath46 solutions by _",

    "an overall normalisation constant has been included in the @xmath62 s so that the corresponding vector density , integrated over the sphere , is three .",
    "the scalar density then enters as a source term in the mean - field equation for the @xmath0 field . with a new field",
    ", the steps can be repeated until convergence is obtained .",
    "the total energy is then e=(9/k_t^3)_0^k_t(k)k^2 dk+4_0^r r^2((r)^2+u())dr .",
    "[ flenergy ]    in everything above we have assumed that the band is filled right to the top .",
    "this is not in fact obvious .",
    "isospin , spin and colour give each state a twelve - fold degeneracy , and there are only three quarks per soliton ; the minimum energy state would therefore correspond to filling only the bottom quarter of the states .",
    "however such a filling would in no way correspond to the quarks in any one cell being coupled up to a colour singlet with the quantum numbers of the proton .",
    "furthermore gluon exchange energies are comparable with the width of the band , and so are capable of negating any saving in energy produced by a concentrated filling . following ref .",
    "@xcite we have used dilute filling .    in the case of the chiral quark - meson model the quark states",
    "are characterised by grand spin ( sum of spin and isospin ) , and the filled quark band gives rise not only to a spherically symmetric quark density , but also an isovector pseudoscalar density .",
    "as required for self - consistency , this has indeed the hedgehog form @xmath79 .",
    "however in practical calculations the full scalar density in the f - l model was found to be very well approximated by truncating the sum over @xmath47 in ( [ scdens ] ) at the lowest value , @xmath54 , and so in the chiral model we only used the @xmath80 states in calculating the source terms for the meson fields .",
    "the quark energy has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ flenergy ] ) , and the meson energy is e_k+e_p= 4_0^r r^2((r)^2+h(r)^2+u(,h))dr .",

    ".    figure 2 shows the energy of a single cell as a function of cell radius .",

    "figure 3 helps to explain this : as the cell radius decreases , the mean radius of the quarks actually increases , with a corresponding decrease in kinetic energy which dominates the energy of the whole cell .",
    "we note also from figs  1 and 2 that the estimate of the top of the band given by the energy at which the upper component vanishes at the cell boundary ( @xmath86 ) , or by @xmath87 , is very different to that given by the self - consistent boundary conditions used here .",
    "this has a profound effect on the results , which are quite different .",
    "dodd and lowe @xcite have studied the one - dimensional f - l soliton crystal analytically .",
    "they found that the energy of the lowest - energy soliton state was very close to the energy of the massive - quark plasma , the difference becoming very small as the cell radius decreases .",
    "unless the top state of the band was occupied , there was a radius at which the solution actually bifurcated from the plasma solution .",
    "in our calculations , however , the soliton solution is well below the massive plasma branch .",

    "thus for the first time a completely self - consistent treatment of the fields in the wigner - seitz cell is possible .",
