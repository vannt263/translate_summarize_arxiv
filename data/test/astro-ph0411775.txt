    "the evolution of the global star formation rate provides a sensitive probe of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the earliest determinations of the evolving star formation rate density ( sfrd ) showed a steep decline from @xmath3 to the present ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; madau et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the behavior of the sfrd at early epochs ( @xmath11 ) remains uncertain due to variations amongst sfr diagnostics and poorly constrained ( yet potentially large ) extinction corrections in the primary rest - frame uv diagnostics ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) . despite these challenges hopkins ( 2004 ) recently compiled results from 33 studies over the range @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the data were used to constrain the luminosity function of star - forming galaxies , and were found to be consistent to within a factor of three over @xmath14 .",
    "additional insight into star formation histories ( sfh ) may be gained by the consideration of other physical galaxy properties .",
    "stellar mass is arguably the key parameter .",
    "the mass in stars provides a measure of the integral of past galaxy stellar mass assembly , which can be coupled with the instantaneous sfr to give a more complete view of galaxy evolution .",
    "mass - based evolution studies are far more deterministic since unlike luminosity , mass evolution is monotonic .",
    "while high - luminosity galaxies often evolve into low - luminosity systems , massive galaxies at early epochs must have descendants among the present massive galaxy population .",
    "recent advances in the modeling of multi - color , and particularly near - ir , selected samples lead to fairly robust determinations of stellar masses for galaxies over a wide range of redshifts and luminosities ( brinchmann and ellis 2000 ; fontana et al .",
    "2004 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter paper iii ) .",
    "heavens et al .",
    "( 2004 ) inferred the star formation history ( sfh ) of the universe by modeling the spectra of 96,545 local sdss galaxies .",
    "their results indicate that sfhs vary strongly with _",
    "present - day _ stellar mass .",
    "galaxies with @xmath15 go through the peak of their star formation ( sf ) at low redshift ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 galaxies show an increasing sf activity to @xmath18 .",
    "we take advantage of the near - ir selection of the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds , abraham et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter paper i ) to study directly the evolution of the sfrd as a function of stellar mass at the epoch of observation .",
    "direct measurements of sfrs in the most massive systems at @xmath11 were made possible only recently , with the progress of spectroscopy of near - ir surveys probing the redshift range @xmath19 .",
    "we use ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) = ( 70 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 , 0.3 , 0.7 ) and vega magnitudes throughout this paper .",
    "the gdds is a spectroscopic survey of an optical and near - ir selected sample targetting massive galaxies at @xmath24 .",
    "the sample is drawn from the las campanas ir imaging survey ( mccarthy et al .",
    "2001 ; chen et al .",
    "2002 ) , and was designed to select galaxies in the @xmath0 range with an emphasis on the reddest galaxies .",
    "galaxy stellar masses are determined from the mass - to - light ratio @xmath25 obtained by fitting the @xmath26 photometry with a grid of sed models ( paper iii ) .",
    "the sample selection function and weights , details of the observations and catalogs are described in paper i. the sampling weights are derived as a function of color and magnitude and are used when computing volume - averaged quantities such as the mass density ( paper iii ) and the sfrd .",
    "the sample selected to compute the sfrd consists of spectra from the gdds that satisfy : ( 1 ) @xmath27 ( survey limit ) , ( 2 ) redshift confidence level greater than 75% ( @xmath28 in paper i notation ) and ( 3 ) absence of strong active galactic nuclei activity ( @xmath29 in paper i notation ) . from the original gdds sample of 308 spectra",
    ", 211 meet the @xmath30-detection and redshift confidence class criteria .",
    "strong agn contamination occurs for 1.9% ( 4/211 ) of those objects , bringing the final sample to 207 galaxies .",
    "given the redshift range spanned by the gdds , the available sfr indicators are the [ oii]@xmath31\\lambda3727 $ ] emission line and the luminosity of the rest - frame uv continuum . for the latter , we chose the absolute rest - frame ab magnitude @xmath32 , defined in a synthetic @xmath33   box filter using an empirical interpolation scheme from the observed @xmath34 and @xmath35 magnitudes ( savaglio et al .",
    "2004 ( paper ii ) ) .",
    "the redshift range is restricted to @xmath36 for sfr([oii ] ) measurements as the [ oii ] emission is redshifted out of the optical range at @xmath37 . for the sfr(@xmath32 ) measurements , we use the redshift range where the @xmath32 interpolation is reliable , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "details of the sfr measurements will be given in a forthcoming paper ( juneau et al . in prep . ) .",
    "briefly , we use the standard sfr(@xmath39 ) conversion of kennicutt ( 1998 ) assuming ( [ oii]@xmath40h@xmath41 ( glazebrook et al . 1999 ) .",
    "since we use the observed ratio , we need to correct the integrated luminosities at h@xmath42 .",
    "we adopt the average extinction of @xmath43 derived from local galaxy samples ( kennicutt 1992 ) .    for sfr measurements based on the rest - frame uv continuum",
    ", we apply a dust attenuation correction of the stellar continuum of @xmath44 .",
    "this is the value typically used in the literature when no direct measure of dust obscuration is available ( e.g. lilly et al .",
    "2003 , sullivan et al .",
    "2000 ) . following the prescription of calzetti ( 2001 )",
    "this correction is @xmath45 at 2000  .",
    "the mean dust obscuration in galaxies depends on sample selection .",
    "@xmath30-band selection could include more heavily obscured systems .",
    "if the mean extinction is greater by 1  mag , the values of sfr (  4 ) and sfrd (  5 ) will shift up by a factor 2.5 whereas @xmath46 (  5 ) will be lower by the same factor .",
    "the sfrd is computed with the @xmath47 method and corrected for both sampling and spectroscopic incompleteness .",
    "we define spectroscopic completeness factors that depend on the color and the magnitude in the same fashion as the sampling weights from paper i. we divide the number of spectra with high confidence redshifts ( @xmath28 ) by the number of slits in each cell of the color - magnitude plane ( see figure 12 of paper i ) .",
    "the median spectroscopic completeness of the sample according to this definition is 82% , consistent with the overall spectroscopic completeness of 79% for the gdds .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the baldry & glazebrook ( 2003 ) ( bg03 ) initial mass function ( imf ) , which has a very similar slope to the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf at high masses and provides a good fit to cosmic and galaxy colors locally .",
    "the galaxy masses and sfrs based on bg03 can be used interchangeably with those of salpeter given the conversion @xmath48 , this ratio is virtually independent of sfh to an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "the sfrs of the individual galaxies are plotted in figure  1 .",
    "the values estimated from the [ oii ] luminosity ( circles ) and those obtained with the continuum luminosity at 2000  ( triangles ) suggest an increase by over one order of magnitude in the upper envelope of the sfr values between @xmath49 and @xmath2 .",
    "the color of the plotting symbols is keyed to the stellar mass of the galaxies .",
    "the mass bin corresponding to the lowest mass galaxies is @xmath50 ( blue ) , the intermediate mass is defined as @xmath4 ( green ) and the high mass galaxies have @xmath51 ( red ) .",
    "note that @xmath30-selected samples will miss contributions from low - mass star - forming galaxies fainter than the @xmath30-limit .",
    "( we show later in figure  2 that our full @xmath27 sample underestimates the _ total _",
    "sfrd by a factor of 23 . )    in nearly 10% ( 20/207 ) of the galaxies , no [ oii ] emission is detected in our spectra .",
    "these systems appear to be primarily massive , quiescent galaxies and their number is uniformly distributed with @xmath52 ( upper limit symbols ) .",
    "the [ oii ] flux limit varies from one spectrum to another , depending on the redshift and the integration time for each mask . a conservative flux detection limit of @xmath53)_{lim }",
    "= 0.6 \\times 10^{-17 } erg~s^{-1 } cm^{-2}$ ] is shown as a dotted line in figure 1 .",
    "the upper envelope of the [ oii]-derived sfrs is representative of star formation in massive galaxies selected at longer wavelength ( e.g. @xmath54 m ) rather than samples selected in the rest - frame uv .",
    "to contrast our @xmath30 selection , figure 1 also shows a complementary dataset : a subsample of hdf - n galaxies detected by chandra ( shown as plus symbols , and taken from cohen 2003 ) .",
    "since strong x - ray and [ oii ] emission is necessary for inclusion in this sample it includes objects with very high sfrs and the sample is not directly comparable .",
    "however , it follows the same trend as the gdds sample .",
    "figure  1 demonstrates that the photometric redshift cut used to select galaxies at @xmath24 was efficient , as only a handful of objects were observed outside that redshift range ( gray area ) .",
    "the two tracers of sfr were directly compared in the redshift interval in which they overlap : @xmath55 .",
    "we found a good linear correlation , with a dispersion @xmath56 ( juneau et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the scatter might result from the fact that adopting a single value for dust attenuation is not likely to be a realistic representation of a diverse set of galaxies .",
    "the mass selection of the gdds provides an opportunity to probe cosmic star formation as a function of galaxy stellar mass . in figure 2",
    "we show the global sfrd for our three mass bins , the total gdds sample , and the compilation from hopkins ( 2004 ) . as in figure 1 ,",
    "the symbol type is keyed to star formation indicator , circles show [ oii ] measurements , the triangles represent rest - frame 2000  based rates .",
    "the local sfrds derived from the sdss by brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in our three mass bins are also shown in figure 2 ( square symbols ) .",
    "these have been transformed to the same imf and corrected for extinction in the same manner as the gdds measurements .",
    "the comparison with figure  1 indicates that the increase of sfrd with @xmath52 is linked with the increase of sfr in individual galaxies .",
    "paper iii shows that for @xmath57 our sample is mass - complete over our full redshift range . at lower masses ,",
    "@xmath58 we start to become incomplete for @xmath59 .",
    "however the effect is minor because it is the _ red _ objects which start to be missed and these contribute _ least _ to the sfrd . in this sense",
    ", mass - incompleteness also means sensitivity biased towards bluer objects . we can estimate this incompleteness , and calculate a reasonable correction , by bootstrapping from the @xmath60 complete sample .",
    "we calculate that if these objects were placed at @xmath61 we would see 90% of the total sfrd , and at @xmath62 we would see 62% .",
    "note we are effectively assuming that the high-@xmath52 sample displays the same range of @xmath63 values as the low-@xmath52 sample . in practice",
    "we expect the high-@xmath52 sample to be bluer , which would make us _ more _ complete .",
    "thus we think our correction is conservative ; we extend the upper error bars in figure  2 to reflect the magnitude of this correction .",
    "for @xmath64 we are incomplete throughout our redshift range and plot the sfrd values as lower limits .",
    "the key result of this paper is illustrated in figure 2 : the cosmic sfrd is a strong function of galaxian stellar mass .",
    "the sfrd in our high mass bin ( @xmath1 ) , while making a minority contribution to the global sfrd , is a factor @xmath65 higher at @xmath2 than it is at present .",
    "the sfrd of these massive galaxies has strongly declined since @xmath2 and reached the present - day level at @xmath3 .",
    "the sfrd in the intermediate mass bin ( @xmath4 ) has also steeply declined since @xmath66 and appears to have reached a peak or a plateau at a redshift of @xmath67 .",
    "the sfrd in the intermediate mass bin then declined to the present day level at @xmath68 and since that time most of the sfrd has been in low mass galaxies .",
    "our lowest mass bin ( @xmath69 ) is strongly mass - incomplete .",
    "the comparison with the hopkins points shows that we miss about half the total sfrd at @xmath8 .",
    "this would come from low mass galaxies fainter than our survey k limit .",
    "additional insight into the growth of galaxies can be gained from comparing the stellar mass density to the sfrd over a range of redshifts .",
    "the ratio gives a characteristic growth timescale @xmath70 which can be interpreted simply as the time required for the galaxies to assemble their observed stellar mass assuming that their observed sfr stays constant .",
    "results for the gdds sample are shown in figure  3 . in this figure",
    "we compare @xmath46 with the hubble time @xmath71 , the age of the universe at a given redshift .",
    "if equal , galaxies can form all their observed stars in a hubble time . at a given redshift",
    ", @xmath72 suggests that the galaxies are in a declining or quiescent star formation mode at the observed redshift and that the bulk their star formation has occurred in the past .",
    "conversely , @xmath73 indicates that the galaxies are going through a burst phase .",
    "this past average - to - present sfr allows us to investigate the _ mode _ of sfr in the sfrd(z ) diagram .",
    "the highest mass galaxies are in a quiescent mode at low-@xmath52 , transiting to a burst mode at @xmath74 .",
    "the intermediate mass objects make a similar transition at @xmath75 .",
    "the lowest mass systems appear to be observed in a burst mode at all redshifts , though we note our selection is only sensitive to the bluest objects for this mass - incomplete subsample .",
    "the transition redshift from burst mode to quiescent mode is a strong function of stellar mass and looks like a time - delayed echo of the corresponding downturn in the sfrd(z ) diagram .",
    "figures 2 and 3 paint a simple picture of galaxy formation in a volume - averaged sense .",
    "the upper envelope of sfr rises with redshift and one sees very clear mass - dependent effects in the sfrd(@xmath52 ) and @xmath76 diagrams",
    ". the mass - scale of the sfr and of burst activity both decline with time .",
    "the basic conclusion is that the most massive systems formed early and were nearly finished forming their stars by @xmath77 .",
    "this is supported by several other lines of evidence .",
    "the reddest galaxies in the @xmath19 interval appear to have ages @xmath78 gyr and @xmath79 ( mccarthy et al .",
    "2004 ; cimatti et al . 2004 ) .",
    "these objects are @xmath80 and suggest that the rising sfrd seen in the high - mass bin of figure 2 continues to increase , reaching a peak somewhere in the @xmath81 interval .",
    "the most massive _ local _ galaxies seen in the sdss also appear to be dominated by stars with early formation redshifts ( heavens et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the hubble sequence begins to emerge between @xmath19 , and appears to be in place at @xmath3 ( brinchmann & ellis 2000 ) .",
    "disk galaxies that are seen at @xmath18 are primarily in massive stellar systems ( e.g. labb et al 2003 ; stockton et al .",
    "as figure  3 shows , by @xmath3 both the high and intermediate mass populations , those that dominated the elliptical and disk portions of the hubble sequence , have transitioned to fairly quiescent sf and have formed the bulk of their stars .",
    "a puzzle remains in the continued accumulation in the _ number _ of massive ( see paper iii and fontana et al . 2004 ) and/or red - sequence ( bell et al . 2004 ) galaxies by a factor of @xmath10 over @xmath82 .",
    "this now has to occur without making a large contribution to the global sfrd in the visible and rest - uv , perhaps via mergers that produce either little or heavily obscured star formation .",
    "our view of galaxy formation reveals a clear ` downsizing ' of star formation from high - mass to low - mass galaxies with time .",
    "this basic picture was first suggested by cowie et al .",
    "the downsizing picture of galaxy _ stellar mass _ assembly is the reverse of the original picture of hierarchical _ dark matter _ assembly ( blumenthal et al .",
    "1984 ) where the large units come last in the sequence",
    ". if the hierarchical picture is correct , then star formation must be much more efficient in early times in high - mass systems , as is required ( e.g. paper iii ) to explain their space densities at high redshift .",
