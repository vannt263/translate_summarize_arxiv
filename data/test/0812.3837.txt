    "neutrino masses constitute concrete evidence for the existence of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , much about the neutrino sector remains to be understood .",
    "it is not known whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana , or whether the pattern of neutrino masses is hierarchical , inverse hierarchical or quasi - degenerate .",
    "further , the dynamics by which the neutrinos acquire their masses , and the scale at which this occurs , are also not known .",
    "one interesting possibility is that the sm neutrinos acquire their masses at or close to the weak scale through the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario the dynamics underlying neutrino mass generation might be accessible to the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "this could happen in several different ways .",
    "for example , if the sm neutrinos are charged under a new @xmath2 gauge symmetry that is broken only close to the weak scale , they are prevented from acquiring mass at higher scales . in these theories",
    "a type i seesaw at the weak scale is perhaps the simplest possibility for neutrino mass generation , with some of the additional particles required for cancellation of the @xmath3 ^ 3 $ ] anomalies playing the role of right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos .",
    "such a scenario is promising for the lhc because the rh neutrinos could be pair - produced through decays of the @xmath0 gauge boson , and are in general straightforward to detect through their lepton - number - violating decays .",
    "other classes of seesaw models that are exciting for the lhc are type ii models with an @xmath1 triplet higgs at the weak scale  @xcite , and type iii models with @xmath1 triplet rh neutrinos at the weak scale  @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we show that in theories where the standard model ( sm ) neutrinos acquire majorana masses through the seesaw mechanism at the weak scale , the requirement that any pre - existing baryon asymmetry is not almost entirely washed out can be used to correlate the pattern of sm neutrino masses to the spectrum of new particles at the weak scale .",
    "then , unless the baryon asymmetry is generated at or below the weak scale , or the pre - existing baryon asymmetry is extremely large , this leads to definite predictions at the lhc for each of the three classes of seesaw models described above .    * in the case of type i seesaw models with a weak - scale @xmath0 , if the sm neutrinos are hierarchical , at least one of the rh neutrinos must be ` electrophobic ' , decaying with a strong preference into final states with muons and tauons rather than electrons . on the other hand ,",
    "if the sm neutrinos exhibit an inverted ( quasi - degenerate ) pattern of masses , at least one of the rh neutrinos must be lighter than 1 tev ( 300 gev ) .",
    "* for type iii seesaw models , the corresponding upper bound for @xmath1 triplet rh neutrinos is 300  gev for inverted neutrino mass pattern and 170  gev for the quasi - degenerate case .",
    "* in the case of type ii seesaw models , a significant portion of the triplet vev and mass ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) parameter space accessible at the lhc is disfavored .",
    "it should be noted that our objective is different from that of previous works whose purpose was to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry thanks to leptogenesis ( for a recent review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "leptogenesis in the type i case has been extensively studied , and it was found that there exists a lower bound on the scale of leptogenesis around @xmath6  gev in the limit of hierarchical rh neutrinos  @xcite . in the type ii case , @xcite found that there is also a lower bound which points to a very high scale .",
    "similarly , the type iii was worked out in @xcite , where a similar bound was obtained .",
    "let us stress here that these bounds are in no way inconsistent with our approach , which is not concerned in any way with the mechanism whereby the baryon asymmetry was originally generated .",
    "instead we study the constraints that arise from requiring that any such asymmetry survive to low temperatures , and is not erased at the weak scale .",
    "more precisely , in this work we focus exclusively on washout , assuming that the effects responsible for the generation of the asymmetry are negligible at the weak scale .    to see the origin of the connection between the properties of the sub - tev scale fields responsible for neutrino mass generation ( i.e. singlet or triplet rh neutrinos or higgs triplet fields ) and the baryon asymmetry , note that since majorana neutrino masses necessarily violate lepton number , any mechanism whereby the sm neutrinos acquire majorana masses at the weak scale will generally lead to some amount of lepton number violation at low energies .",
    "if lepton - number - violating processes are in equilibrium at the weak scale , they can , in combination with sphalerons  @xcite , erase any pre - existing baryon asymmetry , regardless of how the baryon asymmetry originated .    as a concrete example , consider a toy type i model with a single sm lepton doublet @xmath7 that acquires a majorana mass after coupling through the higgs @xmath8 to a single rh neutrino @xmath9 that has a weak - scale mass @xmath10 .",
    "the relevant part of the lagrangian is @xmath11 at temperatures @xmath12 the rate for lepton - number - violating decays and inverse decays of @xmath9 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the sm higgs vev and @xmath15 is the sm neutrino mass . for this process to be in equilibrium , this rate must be larger than the expansion rate @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the planck scale .",
    "lepton - number - violating decays will be in equilibrium for @xmath18 if @xmath19 . for @xmath20 of order 0.05  ev , the atmospheric scale ,",
    "this condition is satisfied in our toy model , and any pre - existing baryon asymmetry will endure washout . however , whether or not the baryon asymmetry is erased in realistic seesaw models is a far more detailed question .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "* since the medium distinguishes all three lepton flavors @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 at the weak scale , and since sphalerons conserve @xmath24 , ( @xmath25 ) lepton flavor violating processes must be in equilibrium for each lepton flavor in order for the baryon asymmetry to be efficiently erased .",
    "this requires taking into account the full spectrum of neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "* the extent to which the baryon asymmetry is erased depends on the period of time that the lepton - flavor - violating processes , most importantly inverse decays , are in equilibrium . for @xmath20 of order the atmospheric scale , these processes are only in equilibrium for a short time .",
    "it then requires a careful analysis to determine how much of the original baryon asymmetry survives . the relevant boltzmann equation describing the washout process by the seesaw mediator(s ) of mass @xmath10",
    "can be written in the general form @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the @xmath24 number density over the entropy density , and @xmath29 is a generic washout term which will have to be specified in each particular case .",
    "this formulation of the washout term is consistent with leptogenesis analyses in the type i and iii cases  @xcite by setting the @xmath30 asymmetry to zero . in the type ii case",
    "@xcite , the situation is slightly more complicated since the scalar triplets carry non - zero hypercharge . as we will show explicitly in section  [ sec : typeii ] , in that case , the evolution of the scalar triplet asymmetry must be tracked as well .",
    "however , we will find that the more complicated system of equations reduces to this simple form in a certain limit .",
    "+ the solution to eq .",
    "( [ boltz ] ) can be easily obtained @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 stands for any pre - existing asymmetry at @xmath33 .",
    "one can therefore see that any pre - existing asymmetry will be _ exponentially _ washed out provided the integral is large .",
    "* the baryon asymmetry , having been erased , can in principle be regenerated by late out - of - equilibrium decays of rh neutrinos .",
    "however , if the masses of the rh neutrinos are of order the weak scale as in the case of interest , the relevant yukawa couplings are generally much too small to allow a large - enough asymmetry to be generated .",
    "however , an exception to this rule occurs if the the rh neutrinos are extremely degenerate , at the level of one part in @xmath34 , in which case resonant leptogenesis can occur  @xcite .",
    "in what follows we will assume that the rh neutrinos are not sufficiently degenerate to allow this possibility , leaving this very special case for future work .",
    "in the subsequent sections we analyse each of the three classes of seesaw models in turn , and determine the precise conditions under which the baryon asymmetry is erased , and the consequences for lhc phenomenology .",
    "we shall place limits on the spectrum of particles at the weak scale by requiring that the baryon asymmetry not be washed out by a factor greater than @xmath35 .",
    "it is important to note that these bounds can be evaded if the baryon asymmetry is generated below the weak scale , or alternatively , if the primordial baryon asymmetry generated at high scales is extremely large , of order @xmath36 or more .",
    "however , such a large primordial asymmetry can not be generated by the familiar out - of - equilibrium decays of a heavy field , but instead requires a very efficient mechanism of baryogenesis , such as the one proposed by affleck and dine  @xcite .",
    "if the lhc were to discover that these bounds are violated , it would shed new light on the mechanism that generates the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "for the type i seesaw case , we assume the presence of three rh neutrinos @xmath37 , @xmath38 with masses @xmath39 around the weak scale . the washout parameter introduced in eq .",
    "( [ boltz ] ) is given in this case by @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",

    "the question then is : how to know the magnitude of @xmath48 .",
    "this can be answered using the parametrization of the yukawa coupling matrix  @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the pmns mixing matrix , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are diagonal matrices for the masses of light and heavy neutrinos , respectively , and @xmath61 is a complex orthogonal matrix . using this parametrization",

    "( [ decpar ] ) in the following way : @xmath62 it should be noted that @xmath63 obey the following inequality : @xmath64 without flavor effects , the washout implied would be huge . with flavor effects the washout is reduced , but one has to check to what extent .    in the case of normal hierarchy and @xmath65 , due to the small @xmath66 entry in the pmns matrix , the washout in flavor @xmath67",
    "is typically suppressed , and it can be as low as @xmath68 , implying little washout . clearly , the washout in the other two flavors is very effective .",
    "we show below that in this case at least one rh neutrino will decay electrophobically .",
    "let us explain how this comes about by first writing the branching ratio for the decay of @xmath37 into each flavor @xmath69 : @xmath70 in the case of normal hierarchy with @xmath71 , for flavor @xmath67 the largest mass eigenstate @xmath72 is coupled to the small entry @xmath73 .",
    "one can then envisage three situations : @xmath74 , latexmath:[$|\\omega_{3i}|\\sim    first case , the decay will be roughly 1/3 in each flavor , but the total rate will be suppressed since it is driven by the solar scale . in the second case , both terms are comparable , implying that @xmath37 will decay typically only 8% into @xmath67 . in the third case ,",

    "quantitatively , varying @xmath82 . in fig .",

    "this means that the baryon asymmetry will be washed out by more than a factor of @xmath35 when @xmath83  tev for 99% of the parameter space .",

    "<S> we consider theories where the standard model ( sm ) neutrinos acquire masses through the seesaw mechanism at the weak scale . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in such a scenario , the requirement that any pre - existing baryon asymmetry , regardless of its origin , not be washed out leads to correlations between the pattern of sm neutrino masses and the spectrum of new particles at the weak scale , leading to definite predictions for the lhc . for type i seesaw models with a tev scale @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> coupled to sm neutrinos , we find that for a normal neutrino mass hierarchy , at least one of the right - handed neutrinos must be ` electrophobic ' , decaying with a strong preference into final states with muons and tauons rather than electrons . for inverted or quasi - degenerate mass patterns , on the other hand , we find upper bounds on the mass of at least one right - handed neutrino . in particular , for an inverted mass hierarchy , this bound is 1 tev , while the corresponding upper limit in the quasi - degenerate case is 300 gev . </S>",
    "<S> similar results hold in type iii seesaw models , albeit with somewhat more stringent bounds . for the type ii seesaw case with a weak scale @xmath1 triplet higgs </S>",
    "<S> , we again find that an interesting range of higgs triplet masses is disallowed by these considerations . </S>"
