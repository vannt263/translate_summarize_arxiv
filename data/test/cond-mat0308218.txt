    "an important drawback of the conventional single - electron transistor @xcite ( set ) is its relatively large output resistance which should be much larger than the quantum resistance @xmath1 .",
    "this limits the operation frequency of the prospective integrated single - electron circuits @xcite and imposes a severe frequency limitation for individual sets used nowadays as electrometers .",
    "estimating the total capacitance of a wire delivering set signal from a cryostat to outside electronics as 1 nf , we get the time constant on the order of @xmath2 ; therefore the operating frequency is limited to few khz , which is a typical value achievable by conventional set setups.@xcite while the operating frequency can be significantly increased by placing a preamplifier in a close vicinity of the set , @xcite the preferred at present solution of the problem is the use of the radio - frequency set @xcite ( rf - set ) which in many instances has already replaced the traditional set setup .",
    "the principle of the rf - set operation is somewhat similar to the operation of the radio - frequency superconducting quantum interference device @xcite ( rf - squid ) and is based on the microwave reflection from a tank ( lc ) circuit containing the set ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) ; another possibility is to use the transmitted wave . @xcite the measured set input signal changes effective set resistance and affects the intensity and the phase of the reflected ( or transmitted ) wave that is later sensed by either homodyne detection or simple rectification ( to separate incoming and reflected waves a directional coupler can be used ) .",
    "the high operation frequency of the rf - set is due to the signal propagation by the microwave , so that the set does not need to charge the whole output wire , while the tank circuit tuned in resonance works as an impedance transformer providing a better match between the effective set differential resistance @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and the microwave cable wave impedance @xmath5 ( typically @xmath6 ) .    for a good matching",
    "the `` unloaded '' quality factor @xmath7 of the tank circuit consisting of inductance @xmath8 and capacitance @xmath9 should be comparable to @xmath10 .",
    "while a much lower value , @xmath11 , was used in the first experiment , @xcite the values close to the matching condition ( sometimes even higher ) are typically used at present .",
    "increase of the @xmath0-factor obviously decreases the rf - set bandwidth limited by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the `` carrier '' microwave frequency and @xmath14 is the `` loaded '' @xmath0-factor , which also takes into account the effect of the set ( see below ) .",
    "the straightforward design @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] can be somewhat modified to reduce the bandwidth further for a dense multiplexing;@xcite however , in this paper we will consider only the original design .",
    "the rf - set bandwidth as wide as 100 mhz has been demonstrated @xcite using a relatively high carrier frequency @xmath15 and relatively low @xmath0-factor @xmath11 .",
    "however , to improve experimental rf - set sensitivity , it happens to be advantageous to reduce the carrier frequency by few times ( to reduce the noise contribution from the amplifier ) and also increase @xmath0 ( closer to the impedance matching regime ) , so that a practical bandwidth at present is about 10 mhz ( for example , the bandwidth of 7 mhz for the carrier frequency of 332 mhz has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the high operation frequency of the rf - set makes it easily possible to avoid the 1/@xmath16 noise limitation of the set sensitivity which is typically dominant at frequencies @xmath17 , and so work in the region of the shot noise limited sensitivity.@xcite though experimentally the contribution from the amplifier noise is still comparable or larger than the set noise , a relatively rapid improvement of the rf - set charge sensitivity from @xmath18 at 1.1 mhz in the first experiment @xcite to the value @xmath19 ( 4.8 @xmath20 in energy units ) at 2 mhz reported in ref .",

    "@xcite )    one of important potential applications of the rf - set is for the readout of the charge qubits in a solid - state quantum computer .",
    "@xcite the possibility of a single - shot qubit measurement requires fast enough distinguishing between two charge states to avoid significant qubit evolution during measurement .",
    "this requires sufficiently wide rf - set bandwidth and most importantly good enough charge sensitivity .",
    "the estimates @xcite show that the single - shot qubit measurement is almost within the reach of present - day rf - set performance ; however , reliable measurement still requires significant improvement in sensitivity .",
    "this makes very important the question of ultimate ( theoretical ) rf - set sensitivity .",
    "the ultimate rf - set sensitivity is also a crucial parameter for monitoring quantum dynamics of nanomechanical resonators @xcite and for a variety of rf - set applications as an electrometer in classical single - electron devices .    in spite of significant experimental activity on rf - sets , we are aware of only few theoretical papers on the rf - sets . the basic theory of the shot noise limited charge sensitivity of the rf - set has been developed in ref .",
    "a similar theory has been applied to the sensitivity analysis for the rf - set - based micromechanical displacement detector . @xcite",
