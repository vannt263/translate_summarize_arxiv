    "after the measurement of the orbital velocities of galaxies within clusters @xcite , many other evidences point to the existence of a form of matter which is not coupled to the electromagnetic or to the strong interactions . among these it is possible to list : the accurate measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmbr ) @xcite ; the the galaxies rotation velocities @xcite,@xcite ; the gravitational lensing @xcite ; the abundances of light elements @xcite ; and the large scale structures @xcite . with the measurements of the cmbr",
    "@xcite the 23% of the universe is estimated to be cold dark matter ( dm ) , while only 4% _ ordinary _ baryonic matter .",
    "dm is coupled with gravitational interaction , and via this force to the ordinary matter . as a matter of fact",
    "n - body simulations predict that dm is arranged in large structures called _ halos _",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the dm density in a halo is large at the centre , and decreases with the distance .",
    "the density profile in the central part of the halo is not experimentally known and is studied by means of fits of n - body simulations or with analytic approaches @xcite .",
    "non - gravitational dm couplings are studied with :    * the direct search for dm scattering on ordinary matter ; * the indirect study of dm annihilation via the secondary products , both charged and neutral ( e@xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath0 rays and lower frequency electromagnetic radiation ) .",
    "dm particles might produce gamma rays :    * if the dm particles self - annihilate in pairs , possibly following the scheme in fig .",
    "1 . this yields a continuum gamma - ray emission , which is produced by hadronization ( or final state radiation ) of the annihilation products and has a cut - off at the dm particle mass .",
    "the direct production of two gamma rays as annihilation products is suppressed in many models ( 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6 of the continuum ) ; * if pseudo - stable dm particles decay in gammas . in this case",
    "the gamma - ray flux is proportional to the dm particle density .",
    "the dm decay constant is bound to be larger than 10@xmath7 sec and is model dependent @xcite .    , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ,",
    "are favoured as annihilation products .",
    "the annihilation into two gamma rays , for some models , is loop - suppressed , with a branching ratio of 10@xmath5 -10@xmath6 .",
    "gamma - ray emission is expected after the heavy fermions hadronize .",
    "the gamma - ray emission energy spectrum is a continuum with curved shape ( in log - log scale ) and a sharp cut - off at the dm particle mass.,width=313 ]    the gamma - ray flux from dm particle annihilation can be decomposed into a particle physics factor and an astrophysical one .",
    "the gamma - ray flux from annihilation can be written as : @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the annihilation cross - section , @xmath13 is the relative velocity of the dm particles , @xmath14 is the number of gamma rays emitted per annihilation for each annihilation channel f , b@xmath15 is the branching ratio of the annihilation channel f and m@xmath16 is the mass of the dm particle candidate .",
    "@xmath17(l ) is the dm density profile , ie the density of dm as a function of the distance from the halo center .",
    "@xmath17(l)@xmath18 is integrated along the observer s line - of - sight ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the gamma - ray flux from decay can be written as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the decay constant , @xmath22 is the number of gamma rays emitted for each decay and m@xmath23 is the mass of the dm particle candidate .",
    "@xmath24 is the dm density profile .",
    "the strong dependence of the emitted @xmath0-ray flux on the dm density profile is evident in the annihilation case , smaller in the decay one .",
    "in fact in the decay scenario @xmath17 , not its square , is integrated along the observer s line - of - sight ( @xmath19 , see fig .",
    "2 ) . in order to search for a gamma - ray signal from dm annihilation ( or decay ) , we observe the region from which we expect the largest signals or the best signal - to - noise ratio , where the noise is the gamma - ray background .    our galaxy could be embedded in a dm halo with the central density enhancement co - located with the galactic center . as the dm gamma - ray emission is expected to be a function of the dm density profile the galactic center",
    "is expected to be the brightest source of gamma rays from dm annihilation ( see fig . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "it might be possible to detect the relatively large dm gamma emission ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , despite the bright gamma - ray emission from astrophysical processes , which is generated both by discrete sources and diffuse backgrounds , in the galactic center region    a better ratio between the dark and baryonic matter , and then a weaker gamma - ray background , is foreseen for the dwarf spheroidal galaxies , or in dm sub - structures in the halo @xcite .     to the centre of the galaxy for a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) halo distribution for decaying dm , solid ( red ) line , compared to the case of self - annihilating dm , dashed ( blue ) line .",
    "both signals have been normalised to their values at the galactic poles , @xmath25 = @xmath2690@xmath27 . reproduced from @xcite.,width=332 ]",
    "the fermi gamma - ray space telescope is a space observatory for the study of gamma - ray emission from astrophysical sources .",
    "it is equipped with two powerful instruments :    1 .   the large area telescope ( lat ) , a pair - conversion telescope , composed of a precision silicon - tracker ( 18 double - sided layers ) and a calorimeter ( 8.6 radiation lengths vertical depth ) , each of which consisting of a 4 @xmath28 4 array of 16 modules and surrounded by a segmented anti - coincidence detector ( acd ) .",
    "lat is operated as a gamma - ray imager in the energy range between 20 mev to over 300 gev ; 2 .",
    "the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) , a detector covering the 8 kev-40 mev energy range , devoted to the study of the gamma - ray bursts .",
    "detailed descriptions of the fermi observatory can be found in @xcite and the lat on - orbit calibration is reported in @xcite .",
    "studies of the gamma - ray sources in the energy range between hundreds of mev and tens of gev were performed by means of the sas 2 and cos b satellites in the years 1972 - 1982 and with the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) onboard of the compton gamma - ray observatory between 1991 and 2000 .",
    "egret detected 271 sources @xcite .",
    "an half of the egret sources are unidentified , mainly because of the relatively large errors associated with the source locations .",
    "the sources detected with egret are mainly members of two classes : active galactic nuclei ( agns ) of fsrq ( flat spectrum radio quasars ) and bl lac types , with powerful relativistic jets of plasma , and pulsars ( spinning neutron stars , with powerful magnetic fields , capable of accelerating particles up to the high energy regime ) .",
    "egret was able to detect both discrete sources and diffuse gamma - ray emissions such as the extra - galactic gamma - ray background and the very intense galactic component .",
    "the large area telescope has an effective area five times larger , a much better angular resolution , and a sensitivity more than 10 times better than its predecessor egret .",
    "the fermi observatory has several scientific objectives , which span many topics of astrophysics and fundamental physics : ( 1 ) the detailed study of pulsars , agns , diffuse emissions and gamma - ray emission from nearby bodies ; ( 2 ) the study of gamma - ray bursts , up to gev energies with the lat and in the better studied kev- mev range by means of the gbm ; ( 3 ) the search for new classes of gamma - ray emitters ; ( 4 ) the possible signals of new physics .",
    "the indirect search for dm particles and the investigation of their nature are major research topics for fermi . here",
    "we report an update of the indirect search for dm from the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "before the launch of the fermi observatory , the sensitivity of the lat instrument for the indirect search for dm was estimated in @xcite . in this publication many possible targets for the observation of gamma - ray emission from annihilating dm are considered and the possible limits on the velocity - averaged annihilation cross - section ( @xmath29@xmath12v@xmath30 parameter ) are given , as a function of the dm particle mass .",
    "for the galactic center , the considered gamma - ray background was the galactic diffuse emission , but not discrete bright gamma - ray sources .",
    "the results are obtained by means of @xmath31 analysis . the plot in fig .",
    "4 shows the constraints in @xmath29@xmath12v@xmath30 vs wimp mass for an assumed pure @xmath32 annihilation channel .",
    "a likelihood analysis was instead performed in @xcite , on simulations of both annihilating dm gamma - ray emission and gamma - ray background ( both galactic diffuse emission and the known discrete gamma - ray sources ) . with this model it was possible to conclude that the fermi / lat is sensitive to many benchmark realizations of a dm source , under the assumption that the simulation of the gamma - ray background is realistic .",
    "for example a dm particle with mass = 50 gev and a @xmath29@xmath12v@xmath30 = 3@xmath2810@xmath33@xmath34s@xmath35 would have provided @xmath36280 events , within a roi of 1.8@xmath27 radius , in 30 ms . in the same time",
    "the simulated background would have generated @xmath3620000 events , and a detection at 5@xmath12 would have been possible , with a maximum likelihood analysis , which exploits both the spatial and the spectral information .",
    "unfortunately the simulated background did not reproduce the real complexity of the region .",
    "@xmath12v@xmath30 parameter between 0.5 and 100@xmath2810@xmath33@xmath34 s@xmath35 .",
    "the galactic diffuse emission ( both conventional and optimized galprop models ) was assumed as background , while the sources were not included as background , and a @xmath31 analysis was applied . in fig 3",

    "the first release of results on the galactic center region obtained with the fermi / lat instrument , was made with the @xmath37 publication ( @xcite , see table 1 ) .",
    "the fermi / lat in 3 months produced a deep and well - resolved map of the @xmath0-ray sky , thus also providing much better localization of the previous known gamma - ray sources .",
    "205 sources were detected during the first 3 months with statistical significance larger than 10 @xmath12 .",
    "the minimum flux for detection of this quality changed from the galactic plane regions ( @xmath38(e@xmath30100 mev)=0.4@xmath2810@xmath39@xmath40s@xmath35 ) to the galactic poles ( @xmath38(e@xmath30100 mev)=0.05@xmath2810@xmath39@xmath40s@xmath35 ) , as a function of the intensity of the bright astrophysical gamma - ray background ( mainly the galactic component ) . in @xcite",
    "the source 0fgl j1746.0 - 29.00 is the source closest to the dynamical center of the of the galaxy .",
    "0fgl j1746.0 - 2900 was reported to be marginally variable in @xcite , but this result was not confirmed with larger statistics .",
    "0fgl j1746.0 - 2900 is likely associated to 3eg j1746 - 2851 , an unidentified egret source . a re - analysis of the egret data @xcite indicated for this source a steady integral flux @xmath38(@xmath30100 mev)=(118@xmath2673)@xmath2810@xmath41@xmath40s@xmath35 , with a position displaced from the exact galactic center toward positive galactic longitudes .",
    "the tev source in the galactic center ( hess j1745 - 290 ) , a bright source above 100 gev , is notably located near 0fgl j1746.0 - 2900 . the energy spectrum measured with h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite over the three years of data taking is compatible with both a power law spectrum with an exponential cut - off ( photon index of 2.10@xmath260.04@xmath420.10@xmath43 and a cut - off energy at 15.7@xmath263.4@xmath44 @xmath262.5@xmath43 tev ) and a broken power law spectrum ( spectral indices of 2.02@xmath260.08@xmath45 0.10@xmath43 and 2.63@xmath260.14@xmath450.10@xmath43 with a break energy at 2.57@xmath260.19@xmath46 0.44@xmath43 tev ) .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     during summer 2009 a first preliminary analysis of the galactic center data , for the indirect search for dm , was reported both at the tevpa @xcite and icrc 2009 @xcite international conferences . for those results",

    "for that 8 months analysis data were binned into a single spatial bin , then no spatial information was considered .",
    "likelihood analysis for the lat data requires a model of the background ( both diffuse emission and known sources ) . at that time",
    "a broken power law was assumed as the model of the gamma - ray emission from this small roi , as it was well - describing the observed data . the broken power - law spectrum was found to have integral flux between 100 mev and 100 gev @xmath50 = ( 1.22@xmath260.02 ) 10@xmath39 @xmath40s@xmath35 , first spectral index @xmath51= -1.38 @xmath26 0.04 , second spectral index @xmath51= -2.60@xmath26 0.05 , energy break at e@xmath52 = ( 1.6@xmath260.1)gev .",
    "then a component representing the gamma - ray emission of annihilating dm was added to the likelihood analysis model .",
    "a benchmark dm realization with mass = 50 gev and a pure @xmath32 annihilation channel spectrum was considered .    with this model it was possible to put an upper limit of 2.43@xmath260.02 10@xmath53 @xmath40s@xmath35 ( 95% confidence level , above 100 mev ) to the integral gamma - ray flux from a dm annihilation source , which was assumed to have a navarro - frenk - white density profile , and",

    "the reported results were obtained with a binned likelihood analysis , performed by means of the tools developed by the fermi / lat collaboration ( gtlike , from the fermi analysis tools @xcite ) . for this analysis :    * a roi of 7@xmath497@xmath27 was considered .",

    "in order to perform the likelihood analysis for the lat data , a model of the already known sources and the diffuse background should be built .",

    "this uncertainty propagates to the model predictions and should be considered in interpreting the residual spectrum in fig 6 .",
    "we have reported a preliminary analysis of the fermi / lat observations of the galactic center .",
    "this analysis was focused on the indirect search for dm . from this preliminary analysis",
    "the following conclusion are obtained :    * any attempt to disentangle a potential dm signal from the galactic center region requires deep understanding of the conventional astrophysics background ; * the bulk of the gamma - ray emission from the gc region is explained with the detected sources and the galactic diffuse emission model , but ... * ... a residual gamma - ray emission is left , not accounted for by the above models .    improved modelling of the galactic diffuse model as well as",
    "the potential contribution from other astrophysical sources ( for instance unresolved point sources ) could provide a better description of the data .",
