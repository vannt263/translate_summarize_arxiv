    "deflection of the beam in a magnetic field is the simplest method for a momentum measurement .",
    "such a measurement could provide very accurate monitoring of slight changes of momentum assuming stability of the magnetic field and the beam position detectors .",
    "two beam momentum monitors at opposite sides of a 180@xmath0 bending magnet allow one to measure the ratio of the particle momenta @xmath5 moving in opposite directions , @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : arc ] ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the method , @xmath7 , is defined by the beam lorentz factor and relative accuracy of the momentum monitors .",
    "arc magnet.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    assuming that there are no acceleration elements between those two momentum measurements and a small correction ( calculable ) on the radiative energy loss , such a ratio should be stable even when the actual beam energy varies .",
    "the value of @xmath8 will be close to 1 with any deviation mainly due to the systematics uncertainties of the momentum monitors .",
    "the configuration could have a large portion of the arc used as a momentum monitor ( the area a ( b ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arc ] ) because it allows higher dispersion and better sensitivity in spite of the angle s being smaller than 180@xmath0 between the two momentum monitors .",
    "the systematics of the @xmath8 measurement are strongly suppressed when the measurements in both monitors perform synchronously .",
    "the proposed measurement of the ratio @xmath8 is sensitive to the directional variation of the speed of light as formulated , for example , in the mansouri - sexl test theory  @xcite .",
    "the results could also be interpreted in terms of the standard model extension  @xcite , whose odd - parity parameter @xmath9 would be constrained .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath8 could reveal , for example , the directional variation of the speed of light due to changes in the beam direction because of the accelerator rotation together with the earth and variation of the speed of motion relative to the cosmic microwave background dipole  @xcite .",
    "a number of accelerators with beam energies in the several gev range have ( or could build ) beam momentum monitors with a level of @xmath10 relative precision over a period of one millisecond .",
    "indeed , the accuracy of the momentum monitor is defined by the precision of the beam position monitors , bpms , and the deflection of the beam trajectory in the dipole magnet .",
    "the rf - based bpms have an accuracy on the level of 1  @xmath11 m for a 0.1 nc beam bunch charge  @xcite .",
    "measurement of the magnet temperature with 0.01@xmath0k accuracy and the magnetic field by means of nmr should allow sufficient short term stability of the magnetic field integral .",
    "the bmps located next to the dipole section with dispersion of 2 - 3 meters should provide the required accuracy of the momentum measurement .",
    "when data are averaged over a few hours , the potential sensitivity of @xmath8 should be on the level of @xmath12 ( limited by the long term stability of the beam position monitors , which could be determined by means of the optical interferometer to sufficient precision as shown e.g. in ref .",
    "the relatively small size of each momentum monitor of 20 meters will help to minimize known distortions such as tide and ground instability .",
    "the combined effect of these uncertainties on the precision of the @xmath8 measurement we estimate to be less than @xmath13 .",
    "the stability of measurement could be greatly improved by means of two beams ( electron and positron ) moving in the same magnetic system , which would allow a full compensation of drift of the momentum monitor characteristics with normalization of the electron ratio @xmath14 to the positron ratio @xmath15 .",
    "the double ratio @xmath16 would be immune to most instabilities .",
    "this double ratio has also doubled sensitivity to the directional variation of the speed of light .",
    "such a measurement could be performed with a single storage ring collider , e.g. cesr or vepp-4 .",
    "the sidereal periodicity of the possible signal when used in the fourier analysis of the data will allow suppression of the systematics by a factor of 10 - 20 depending on the duration of the experiment . by combining the resulting sensitivity of the momenta ratio measurement @xmath8 of @xmath17 with the factor of the beam ( @xmath18 )",
    ", one can find that the signal sensitivity is @xmath19 or better for @xmath20 , which would be a significant improvement for the limit on the odd - parity anisotropy , whose current value is @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the jlab cebaf accelerator  @xcite has the most advantageous parameters for the proposed experiment because its beam has a high current of 100 @xmath11a , a relative energy spread of a few 10@xmath22 , and geometrical emittance of 10@xmath23 m@xmath24rad ( in spite of significant broadening due to radiation losses in the last few turns ) .",
    "the accelerator sections are separated by 180@xmath0 arcs , and the beam recently reached @xmath25 , the highest lorentz factor among the currently operating accelerators .",
    "the absolute value of the beam energy in a linear accelerator could vary , but this does not impact the proposed investigation because only the ratio of the beam momenta at opposite sides of the arc needs to be stable .",
    "in addition , the value of the anisotropy could be constrained at 10 different arcs with increasing beam energy .",
    "the masses of the narrow resonances ( @xmath26 , and z ) have been measured with high precision in electron - positron colliders . for example",
    ", the mass of the @xmath27 is known with a relative accuracy of @xmath28 and the mass of the @xmath29 with @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "these collider results were obtained using a precision measurement of the beam energies via the spin resonance method , which allows accurate determination of the absolute value of the beam lorentz factor  @xcite .",
    "variation of the speed of light leads to a change of the lorentz factor along the beam orbit in a storage ring .",
    "the resonance could be used as the second method of beam energy measurement needed in a search for a sidereal time variation of the beam @xmath31 .",
    "because the beam directions at the location of the energy meter and the @xmath32 collision point are different ( in some experiments ) , the average observed lorentz factor of the beams is not necessarily equal to the ratio of the meson and electron masses . for a symmetric - energy collider ( equal energies of a positron and an electron beam ) to first order the effect",
    "is canceled out .",
    "the b - factories at slac and kek  @xcite could access the non - isotropic component of the speed of light due to the large difference in the lorentz factor of the electron and positron beams .",
    "the variation in the ratio @xmath33 could be expressed as @xmath34 .",
    "the full observed width of the @xmath29 resonance is of 10 mev ( mainly due to the beam energy spread ) .",
    "this would lead to an estimate of a potential constraint on @xmath20 of @xmath35 .",
    "finally , very large statistics of accumulated @xmath29 events in the kek experiment  @xcite , @xmath36 , boosts potential sensitivity to @xmath37 .",
    "the sidereal variation of the observed resonance mass ( at the fixed beams energies ) would be a signal of the anisotropy of the speed of light .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moments @xmath38 of an electron and positron were measured to a @xmath39 relative accuracy in single particle traps  @xcite , which puts a stringent constraint on the cpt violating parameter of sme  @xcite .",
    "independent measurement on the level of @xmath40 was performed at the vepp2 m storage ring with 650  mev beams of electrons and positrons  @xcite .",
    "these beams of electrons and positrons move in the storage ring in opposite directions and their lorentz factors are obtained by the spin resonance method . assuming that @xmath41 ( constraint  @xcite ) and equal masses of an electron and a positron , we can find the difference of the lorentz factors of these two beams and use such an experiment for a search of the anisotropy of the speed of light .",
    "sensitivity of the experiment  @xcite corresponds to .",
    "there is the potential to reach a higher precision of @xmath42 of @xmath43 with the beam method  @xcite ; alternatively , one can perform such a measurement using the vepp-4 storage ring , where an almost ten times higher beam @xmath31 factor leads to higher sensitivity .",
    "the resulting estimate for @xmath44 of @xmath43 means that the search sensitivity for is about @xmath19 from multiple measurements with different sidereal phases .",
    "the author takes pleasure in acknowledging helpful discussions with v. g.  gurzadyan of the graal experiment and with c.  keppel , b.  vlahovic , and v.  zelevinsky of the current concepts .",
