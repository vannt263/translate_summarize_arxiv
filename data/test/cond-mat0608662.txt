    "the subject of superfluidity in ultracold trapped fermionic gases is an exciting field @xcite , not only for its implications in atomic physics , but also because there are important implications for condensed matter systems , including perhaps high temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "there are two important aspects which are particularly notable about these systems , from the perspective of the present paper .",
    "they can be tuned in various ways which are not available to nature - made superconductors .",
    "thus , one can study the entire regime from bcs to bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , simply by the application of a magnetic field in concert with a feshbach resonance .",
    "moreover , one can vary the concentrations of the two spin species arbitrarily @xcite ; in a fashion , this simulates the application of a magnetic zeeman field .",
    "this latter tuneability has important implications for other sub - disciplines in physics such as dense qcd and ( isospin asymmetric ) nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "equally important is the fact that there is a rich collection of experimental data from two different atomic physics groups @xcite on @xmath2li gases near unitarity , with which one can compare various theoretical results .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present an overarching theoretical framework for dealing with fermionic gases over the entire range of bcs to bec crossover and the entire range of temperature , as well as the entire range of population imbalance .",
    "the foundations of this theory lie with the initial observation of eagles @xcite and of leggett @xcite that the bcs - like wavefunction has a much greater generality than was originally recognized at the time of its proposal .",
    "it is capabable of describing both bcs and bec like systems , providing the pairing attraction is tuneable from arbitrarily weak ( bcs ) to arbitrarily strong ( bec ) and one self consistently solves for the fermionic chemical potential .",
    "this mean field - like ground state wave function is also readily generalized to include population balance .",
    "indeed , there are at least three well studied phases @xcite which have been proposed to accomodate a difference in the population of the two spin species .",
    "what we want to stress is that these same mean field theories have a natural extension to finite temperature @xcite .",
    "this extension will be a focus of the present paper .    at strictly zero temperature ,",
    "there is a rather extensive literature @xcite on these population - imbalanced superfluids and superconductors , including recently the effects of the crossover from bcs to bec .",
    "there have also been some studies at finite @xmath0 , which are at the mean field level and do not include the effect of the non - condensed pairs @xcite we consider here .",
    "the three most studied phases are the  sarma \"- like @xcite or breached pair states in which ( as in bcs theory ) the condensed pairs have zero net momentum , but polarization can , nevertheless , be introduced . at @xmath3",
    "this state appears to be stable in the deep bec regime .",
    "additionally , two different phases @xcite have been proposed by larkin and ovchinnikov and by fulde and ferrell ( loff ) in which the condensate has a net momentum of a pre - determined @xmath4 or of @xmath5 .",
    "even more elaborate crystalline lattices of various @xmath6 have also been contemplated @xcite .",
    "it is believed that these states are more appropriate closer to the bcs side of resonance , although rather little has been determined about the  two - plane wave \" loff state near @xmath3 or in the presence of crossover effects .",
    "added to this complexity is the possiblity of heterogeneous or phase separated states @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will present the theoretical formalism for the sarma and one and two - plane wave loff states at zero and finite @xmath0 as one varies from bcs to bec .",
    "we note that because theories of population imbalanced superfluids are ( currently , without exception ) based on bcs - leggett - type @xcite ground states , it is important to determine their finite temperature implications within this broad class of ground states , as we do here .",
    "our premise is that the effects of finite @xmath0 , which necessarily must be accomodated in any comparison with experiment , must be compatible with the @xmath3 formalism . indeed ,",
    "one of the most important effects of temperature is to stabilize the sarma - like phase . in this way",
    "one finds an intermediate temperature superfluid @xcite , one that exists at @xmath7 , but not at @xmath3 .",
    "our studies of the two - plane wave loff state present new results by extending the current literature away from the landau - ginzburg regime ( near @xmath1 ) .    with this class of generalized mean field theories we will show that the effects of temperature enter in a fashion which is strongly reminiscent of bose gas condensation . except in the bcs limit",
    ", pairs form at higher temperatures , than the ( transition ) temperature @xmath1 at which they condense .",
    "thus we have to distinguish the excitation gap [ called @xmath8 from the order parameter [ called @xmath9 .",
    "alternatively , this means that there is an excitation gap ( or pseudogap @xmath10 ) for fermionic excitations even in the normal phase .",
    "it also implies that below @xmath1 there will be additional modes of exciting the condensate via pair excitations .",
    "these latter are non - condensed or incoherent pairs with finite center of mass momentum .",
    "we have found @xcite that in a trapped geometry they are particularly important for providing a mechanism of getting polarization into the gas .     & &    @xmath11 , @xmath12     + & & + & & +    these effects of finite @xmath0 can be compared with an alternative class of theories in the literature based on work by nozieres and schmitt - rink ( nsr ) @xcite .",
    "this approach is known to lack self - consistency @xcite .",
    "we stress that the finite temperature nsr approach was not designed to be consistent with the standard ground state equations . this observation has also been made in ref .",
    "indeed , these latter authors have presented in considerable detail @xcite a more complete finite @xmath0 approach based on the @xmath1 calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite . a major concern about",
    "this class of theories remains to be addressed .",
    "because the gap and the number equations are not treated on an equivalent basis , it is possible that the superfluid density will not consistently vanish at @xmath1 . at this temperature",
    "there has to be a precise , but delicate cancellation of paramagnetic and diamagnetic current contributions , as found in the present theory @xcite . in a related fashion , pseudogap effects ( associated with the presence of non - condensed pairs ) appear , within an nsr - based approach , in the number equation but not in the gap equation .",
    "we begin at the more physical level by stressing the analogy between condensation in this composite boson or fermionic superfluid and condensation in a gas of ideal point bosons .",
    "our theory treats self - consistently two - particle and one - particle green s functions on an equal footing . because the physics is so simple and clear",
    ", we can fairly readily anticipate the form of the central equations of this bcs - bec generalization of bcs theory .",
    "it is important to stress , however , that these equations can be derived more rigorously from a truncated series of equations of motion for the appropriate green s functions @xcite .",
    "there are three principle equations which govern bose condensation : the vanishing of the bosonic chemical potential at all @xmath13 is the first . throughout this paper",
    "we will refer to this condition as the  bec condition \" .",
    "it is related to the usual thouless criterion , but the latter is generally associated only with the temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the second equation is the boson number equation .",
    "all  bosons \" must be accounted for as either condensed or non - condensed .",
    "the third equation is the number of non - condensed  bosons \" , which are created by thermal excitations .",
    "this is determined simply by inserting the known excitation spectrum of the excited pairs or bosons , into the bose distribution function . with this equation , and the first equation",
    ", one can then deduce the number of condensed bosons .",
    "these three central equations for bosons are indicated in table i , on the far right , for true point bosons , and in the second column for the composite bosons which appear in fermionic superfluids . for these composite bosons",
    "the quantity which provides a measure of the  number \" of bosons ( @xmath14 ) is given by @xmath15 ( up to a constant coefficient , @xmath16 ) .",
    "this is reasonably easy to see . in the fermionic regime ,",
    "when the fermionic chemical potential is positive , @xmath15 represents the square of the excitation gap .",
    "this is the energy which must be supplied to break apart the pairs .",
    "thus , @xmath15 , in some sense then , reflects the number of pairs .",
    "how does one quantitatively establish the appropriate  boson number \" for the fermionic case ?",
    "this is determined via the self consistent gap equation for @xmath17 , which , in turn , is determined using the first condition : that the pair chemical potential is zero at and below @xmath1 .",
    "how does one compute the number of excited pairs ? once the gap equation is interpreted in terms of the appropriate non - condensed pair propagator , then one knows the related excitation spectrum @xmath18 of this propagator .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 which appears in the last equation of the table ( for the composite bosons ) gives the relation between the gap associated with non condensed pairs ( @xmath10 ) and the number of pairs ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "it can be readily calculated in this theory ; once one has the non - condensed pair propagator , @xmath16 appears as the inverse residue .",
    "( deep in the bec regime , @xmath16 is relatively simple to compute , for here the boson number density approaches the asymptote @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the fermion density ) .",
    "more precisely , the total number of bosons in the present case has to be determined self - consistently through the gap equation .",
    "it also involves the fermion number equation through the related fermionic chemical potential . in this last context",
    ", it should be stressed that there is one important aspect of the fermionic superfluids , which is not apparent in table i. for bcs - bec crossover , it is essential to derive the self consistent equation for the fermionic chemical potential ; in this problem the fermions are the fundamental statistical entity .",
    "this can be readily accomplished within the same framework used to arrive at the gap equation .",
    "the vanishing of the pair chemical potential is associated with a particular choice for the pair propagator involving dressed green s functions .",
    "these , in turn , determine the fermionic chemical potential through the fermion number equation . in the next two sections we turn to the gap and number equations , and show through a green s function formulation , how strongly these two equations are inter - connected .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we conclude this section with a summary of the central equations associated with our @xmath0-matrix scheme . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] , we present a mean - field theory for the sarma and one - plane - wave loff state for @xmath22 . due to the complexity of the two - plane - wave loff state , we dedicate an entire section ( sec.[sec : iii ] ) to its mean - field treatment . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] we present a generalization of our @xmath0-matrix formalism to include pairing fluctuation effects .",
    "section [ sec : v ] recapitulates our simple physical picture and section [ sec : vi ] presents our conclusions .",
    "additional , more technical details are given in two appendices for the one and two plane wave loff states .",
    "to make contact with the general class of mean field theories ( including the sarma and loff states ) , we introduce a @xmath0-matrix approximation .",
    "this means that we consider the coupled equations between the particles ( with propagator @xmath23 ) and the pairs [ with propagator @xmath24 and drop all higher terms .",
    "this theory does not include direct  boson - boson \" interactions , although the pairs do interact indirectly via the fermions , in an averaged or mean field sense . throughout sections [ sec : ii ] and",
    "[ sec : iii ] of this paper we will be showing that the bec condition noted in the previous section will give the same gap equation we find using standard techniques , such as bogoliubov diagonalization applied to the linearized mean field hamiltonian .",
    "here , for all @xmath25 , the bec condition is interpreted as requiring that the pair chemical potential @xmath26 associated with the non - condensed pairs vanish . in sections",
    "[ sec : ii ] and [ sec : iii ] we will address only the first line of table i. the second two lines , or sets of equations will be discussed in section [ sec : iv ] . within a @xmath0-matrix scheme ,",
    "the pair propagator is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the spin _",
    "symmetrized _ pair susceptibility , and @xmath29 is the pairing interaction strength . the function @xmath30 is , in many ways , the most fundamental quantity we introduce in this paper .",
    "it provides the basis for obtaining well known ( as well as new ) results of the zero temperature theory .",
    "moreover , it provides the basis for arriving at a finite temperature description , which appears in section [ sec : iv ] .",
    "the introduction of spin symmetrization is only important for the case of population imbalance . in earlier literature",
    "@xcite , this complexity did not arise .",

    "we will discuss @xmath23 in more detail on a case by case basis .",
    "here @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the kinetic energy of fermions , and @xmath38 is the fermionic chemical potential for spin @xmath39 . throughout this paper ,",

    "however , when we include the contribution of non - condensed pairs ( or pseudogap effects ) the general values of @xmath48 become important . for the sarma phase we have the bec condition @xmath52 more generally , for loff - like states we have the bec condition at finite @xmath4 : @xmath53 we will discuss , in considerable detail , the nature of the mean field self energy which appears in the full green s function @xmath54 . not only does this determine the gap equation but it also leads to the number equations which can be written in terms of green s functions as @xmath55 .",
    "the number and gap equations then provide the underlying basis for the mean field approach .",
    "and we will see that the _ same _ propagator for non - condensed pairs [ @xmath24 enters into the beyond - mean - field corrections .",
    "it is important to stress that when we refer to `` mean field '' based approaches in sections [ sec : ii ] and [ sec : iii ] of this paper , we will not be distinguishing between the order parameter @xmath56 and the excitation gap @xmath57 .",
    "subsequently we will show that this distinction is actually an important one in all but the bcs limit . specifically",
    ", we note that the expressions we present in sections [ sec : ii ] and [ sec : iii ] within our green s function - based formulation , are more generally valid below @xmath1 , but for the excitation gap @xmath57 , not for the order parameter .",
    "we now want to study the sarma or breached pair state . on the fermionic side of resonance , the dispersion relation of one of the two quasi - particle bands ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 , defined below ) has two zero crossings , at momenta @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xmath63 .",

    ", there is a new form of condensate excitation , not found in bcs theory and associated with excited pair states .",
    "as the pairing attraction becomes stronger , it pays to excite pairs of atoms rather than create single fermion excitations which cost an energy gap .",

    "we find that the bulk of the polarization is carried in the pseudogap region of the trap : outside the condensate but in the region where both spin states ( and thus pairing ) are present . because we find that only modest polarizations are stable , it appears necessary in future to include loff - like condensates as well , although their stability must be demonstrated @xcite .",

    "<S> physically , these effects are associated with the presence of pre - formed pairs ( or a fermionic pseudogap ) in the normal phase , and pair excitations of the condensate , in the superfluid phase . </S>",
