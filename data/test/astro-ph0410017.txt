    "although the synchrotron x - ray emissions were observed from several snrs , the total number and the x - ray fluxes so far discovered are insufficient to account for all cosmic rays in our galaxy ; if snrs are the main accelerator of the cosmic rays , we can expect more non - thermal snrs .",
    "accordingly , we searched for the snr candidates in the data of the @xmath2 galactic plane survey which covered @xmath17 @xmath18 on the galactic plane ( yamauchi et al .",
    "about half a dozen candidates were found in this survey area ; follow - up deep exposure observations with @xmath2 were made on three candidates , g11.0 + 0.0 , g25.5 + 0.0 , and g26.6@xmath160.0 , and these were suggested to be non - thermal snrs ( bamba et al . 2003a ) .",

    "although the data were obtained from both the epic - mos ( turner et al .",
    "2001 ) and epic - pn ( str@xmath21der et al . 2001 ) cameras , the major part of these objects were suffered by the pn - ccd gaps and bad columns , and we verified that cleaned pn data do not improve accuracy of results obtained with mos only , hence we ignore the pn data hereafter .",
    "all the epic instruments were operated in the full frame mode with the medium filter .",
    "we used version 5.4.1 of the standard analysis system ( sas ) software , and selected x - ray events with pattern keywords between 0 and 12 .",

    "after the filtering , the exposure times of mos1 and mos2 are 20.5  ks and 21.2  ks , respectively .",
    "the filtering using the same prescription was also performed on the observation of g38.55 + 0.0 .",
    "then the filtered exposure times of mos1 and mos2 are 15.1  ks and 15.4  ks , respectively .    in order to estimate the residual soft - proton cotamination ( which is vignetted ) , we calculated the value `` r '' according to section b.2 of de luca and molendi ( 2004 ) .",
