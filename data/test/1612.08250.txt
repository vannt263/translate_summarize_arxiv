    "<S> compact objects with a light sphere such as black holes and wormholes can reflect light rays like a mirror . </S>",
    "<S> this gravitational lensing phenomenon is called retrolensing and it is an interesting tool to survey dark and compact objects with a light sphere near the solar system . in this paper , we calculate the deflection angle in the strong deflection limit analytically in the reissner - nordstrm spacetime without the expansion in power of the electrical charge . using the obtained deflection angle in the strong deflection limit , we investigate a retrolensing light curve and the separation of a double image by the light sphere of a reissner - nordstrm black hole . </S>"
