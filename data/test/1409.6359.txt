    "cellular automata ( ca ) have found many applications in the field of complex systems modeling .",
    "there is a number of works devoted to ca models for simulation of real - world phenomena like pedestrian dynamics @xcite , traffic flow @xcite , urban growth @xcite , etc . in most cases ,",
    "the update rule and neighborhood for ca are determined by human experts that have knowledge of the modeled phenomenon .",
    "automatic identification of ca - based models remains an open research issue .",
    "several attempts have been made in the literature to develop algorithms for ca identification .",
    "however , most of the previous research did not investigate the use of real - world data sets as an input .",
    "the available algorithms were designed and tested mainly against synthetic data obtained from ca evolution .",
    "the use of real - world data for identification of ca models poses additional challenges due to inherent complexity of modeled phenomena and errors that are made during data acquisition .",
    "this paper discusses the possibility of using data mining techniques based on the rough sets theory @xcite to select neighborhood and determine rules for ca models . according to the proposed approach ,",
    "input data describing observed states of cells are represented in form of a decision table .",
    "neighborhood is detected by using algorithms for reducts calculation .",
    "cells that do not belong to the neighborhood are removed from the decision table .",
    "after that , a rule - learning method is applied to induce a set of decision rules that define the evolution of ca .",
    "this approach was tested in identification of both deterministic and probabilistic ca models for synthetic as well as real - world data sets .",
    "most of the works related to the ca identification problem use genetic algorithms as a tool to extract update rule and neighborhood from spatio - temporal patterns produced in ca evolution @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a genetic algorithm was employed to learn probabilistic rules directly from experimental data for two - dimensional binary - state ca .",
    "several methods were proposed that use genetic algorithms to learn ca rules and neighborhood size for image processing tasks @xcite .",
    "although application of genetic algorithms was a dominant approach to ca identification , some non - genetic techniques are also available .",
    "adamatzky @xcite proposed several approaches to extracting rules for different classes of ca .",
    "straatman et al .",
    "@xcite developed a form of hill climbing and backtracking to identify ca rules . in @xcite a  deterministic sequential floating forward search method was used to select rules of ca .",
    "another approach is based on parameter estimation methods from the field of system identification @xcite . a framework for solving the identification problems for both deterministic and probabilistic ca was presented in @xcite .",
    "main drawbacks of the existing ca identification methods are related to the fact that they were either designed for a particular class of ca , or their experimental evaluation was limited to the case of synthetic data .",
    "the introductory research results presented in this paper shows that the rough sets approach may be effectively used to develop a universal method for identification of ca models that mimic real - world phenomena .",
    "formally , a cellular automaton can be defined as a triple @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a non - empty set of cell states , @xmath2 is the neighbourhood , and @xmath3 is the update rule .",
    "arguments of @xmath3 are the current states of cells in the neighbourhood , while the value of @xmath3 indicates the state of a central cell at the next time step .",
    "the problem of ca identification involves finding both the cells neighborhood and the update rule on the basis of a training data set , which includes observed states of the cells . in order to use the rough sets approach for solving this problem ,",
    "the training set of data has to be represented in the form of a decision table @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a non - empty set of observations and @xmath6 is a set of cell states : @xmath7 .",
    "state of @xmath8-th cell at time step @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "index @xmath11 indicates the central cell , for which neighborhood and update rule have to be found .",
    "thus , the cell state @xmath12 is used as the decision attribute .",
    "the remaining cell states @xmath13 are condition attributes .",
    "the candidate neighbors @xmath14 are the cells for which distance to the central cell @xmath11 is lower than a threshold value .",
    "the threshold is determined experimentally . above definition",
    "can be easily extended to multidimensional ca by adding the necessary indexes .",
    "neighborhood for the @xmath11-th cell can be selected by calculating reducts of the above - defined decision table .",
    "a reduct is a subset of the condition attributes , which is sufficient to determine the decision attributes @xcite .",
    "taking into account the decision table discussed above , reduct should be defined as a subset of cell states @xmath15 , which preserves discernibility of the observations with regard to the decision @xmath12 , and none of its proper subsets has this ability .",
    "observations are discernible if they differ in at least one condition attribute ( cell state ) .",
    "each two observations that have different decisions @xmath12 and are discernible by the full set of cell states @xmath16 are also discernible by the reduct @xmath17 .    the neighborhood @xmath2 of a cell",
    "is determined as a set of cells , whose states belongs to the reduct @xmath18 , where @xmath8 is a cell index .",
    "there may exist multiple reducts for one decision table .",
    "selection of the neighborhood is made with regard to the shortest reduct , because size of the neighborhood has to be minimized .",
    "if there are several minimal reducts then the one is selected which has the lowest average distance between neighbors and the central cell .",
    "when the reduct @xmath17 is found , the condition attributes that do not belong to this reduct are excluded from the decision table .",
    "thus , the modified decision table @xmath19 has the following set of attributes : @xmath20 , where @xmath12 remains the decision attribute",
    ".    update rule of a cellular automaton is identified as a set of decision rules by taking into account the information from the modified decision table @xmath21 .",
    "a particular decision rule @xmath22 has the following form :    @xmath23    where : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath1 denotes the set of allowable cell states .",
    "two characteristics of decision rules are useful for the proposed method : support and match @xcite .",
    "support of rule @xmath22 , denoted by @xmath26 , is equal to the number of observations from @xmath21 for which rule @xmath22 applies correctly , i.e. , premise of the rule is satisfied and the decision given by rule is consistent with the one in decision table .",
    "@xmath27 is the number of observations in @xmath21 for which the rule @xmath22 applies , i.e. , premise of the rule is satisfied .",
    "based on these two characteristics , a certainty factor is defined for the decision rule @xmath22 :    @xmath28    the certainty factor may be interpreted as a conditional probability that decision of rule @xmath22 is consistent with an observation in the decision table @xmath21 , given that premise of the rule is satisfied .",
    "1 summarizes the main operations that are necessary to identify a cellular automaton by using the rough sets approach . in this study ,",
    "reducts and decision rules are calculated using algorithms implemented in the rses software @xcite .",
    "three algorithms of reducts calculation were examined : exhaustive , genetic , and dynamic reduct algorithm .",
    "moreover , the experiments involved application of three algorithms that enable induction of decision rules : exhaustive , genetic , and lem2 .",
    "in this section , the proposed approach is applied for identification of three deterministic ca @xcite : elementary cellular automaton with wolfram s rule 184 ( eca-184 ) , deterministic version of nagel - schreckenberg cellular automaton ( nash - d ) , and the conway s game of life cellular automaton ( life ) .",
    "eca-184 is a one - dimensional cellular automaton with binary cell states and neighborhood of three cells wide .",
    "original definition of the eca-184 update rule is presented in fig .",
    "2 . the upper row in this figure illustrates all possible states of a central cell and its neighborhood .",
    "lower row shows states of the central cell after update  in the next time step of the ca evolution .",
    "identification of eca-184 was performed using a training data set of 500 observations .",
    "each observation in the decision table @xmath29 has covered a group of 21 cells ( candidate neighbors ) and the 11-th cell was considered as the central one .",
    "the neighborhood of eca-184 was correctly recognized by each of the reducts calculation algorithms ( exhaustive , genetic , and dynamic ) .",
    "the shortest reduct was determined as @xmath30 , thus the modified decision table @xmath21 had four attributes : @xmath31 .",
    "tab . 1 presents the decision rules that were calculated from table @xmath21 by using the lem2 algorithm .",
    "symbol @xmath32 indicates that a given cell state does not occur in a particular decision rule , e.g. , the rule no . 3 from tab .",
    "1 should be interpreted as : @xmath33 .",
    "the set of decision rules in tab .",
    "1 is consistent with the original update rule of eca-184 ( fig .",
    "the remaining algorithms of rule induction ( exhaustive and genetic ) have also generated valid sets of decision rules ; however their size was larger ( 6 rules ) .",
    ".decision rules generated for eca-184 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the unrealistic model behavior may occur because the decisions for uncertain rules are made randomly , without any coordination .",
    "e.g. , the rules 7 and 13 in tab . 5",
    "apply to the same configuration of cells @xmath34 .",
    "if for both rules the random decision is 1 then the resulting configuration @xmath35 includes three instead of two occupied cells .",
    "this problem was resolved by adding error detection rules to the ca update algorithm .",
    "if error is detected by rules ( 4 ) then the update of cells @xmath36 is repeated .",
    "@xmath37    above modifications allow the ca to perform realistic simulation of traffic flow .",
    "3 presents time space diagrams for two shock waves .",
    "the shock wave a ) was observed in real highway traffic and the shock wave b ) was obtained from evolution of the identified ca .",
    "this example illustrates the possibility of using the rough sets approach for identification of ca - based models of real - world phenomena .",
    "results of the introductory research show that the data exploration techniques based on rough sets theory enable proper selection of neighborhood and update rule induction for different classes of ca .",
    "it was also demonstrated that the rough sets approach is suitable for ca models identification from real - world data sets .",
    "the best results were obtained for the proposed ca identification procedure when implemented by using the dynamic reducts algorithm for neighborhood selection and the lem2 algorithm for decision rules induction . nevertheless , in case of stochastic ca identification , some additional actions were necessary ( reduct shortening , adding error detection rules ) .",
    "verification of the usability of the proposed approach for a wider set of data as well as comparison with state - of - art methods based on genetic algorithms remain open issues for further research .",
    "another interesting topic for future studies is to apply the proposed method in a data exploration system for ca - based image processing @xcite .",
