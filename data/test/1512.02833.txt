    "on the one hand , the two approaches lead to an identical description of the boundary conditions that ensure self - adjointness @xcite . on the other hand , the singularities of green function ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) are successfully eliminated using the so - called renormalization procedure @xcite . such a procedure is implemented in the theory of singular perturbations in its most natural way @xcite .    as an illustration ,",
    "let us consider a formal `` operator '' @xmath21 , where @xmath11 in ( [ eq : diffop ] ) is written in matrix representation , and where @xmath22 is the dirac distribution concentrated at the origin ; for @xmath18 , this type of operator , when restricted to one spatial dimension but extended to the many - body case , is studied in @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath23 , which is hermitian and invertible , plays the role of the coupling parameter of contact interaction .",

    "the model studied in the current paper is investigated by means of the theory of singular perturbations for the first time .",
    "the lack of rigorous results concerning the spectral analysis of the perturbed @xmath11 may be explained by the complexity of the green function for the free hamiltonian ( or else the trivial extension of @xmath11 ) .",
    "a typical strategy is to write the green function in the momentum representation .",
    "then the dispersion relation and the essential spectrum are easy to deduce .",
