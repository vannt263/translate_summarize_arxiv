    "laser frequency stabilization is an essential requirement for various applications including atom cooling@xcite , high resolution spectroscopy@xcite , precision measurements@xcite etc .",
    "a setup for laser cooling and trapping of atoms requires several lasers which are actively frequency stabilized and locked at few line - widths detuned from the peak of atomic absorption . in the laser cooling experiments , the active frequency stabilization is achieved by generating a reference signal which is based on absorption profile of atom around the resonance .",
    "the reference locking signal can be either doppler - broadened with wide tuning range or doppler - free with comparatively much steeper slope but with limited tuning range .",
    "the most commonly used technique for frequency locking involves locking to the side of the doppler free peak generated from the saturated absorption spectroscopy ( sas)@xcite .",
    "the locking of the laser frequency to the peak of an atomic reference signal such as in frequency modulated spectroscopy ( fms)@xcite provides high signal to noise ratio ( snr ) but needs dithering of laser frequency and a phase sensitive detection system . a suitable dispersion - like reference signal for peak",
    "locking can be generated using polarizing spectroscopy ( ps)@xcite without frequency modulation and phase sensitive detection .",
    "along with these techniques , there are also methods for laser frequency stabilization which employ ps with external magnetic field@xcite . however , the techniques involving polarization spectroscopy are sensitive to the surrounding stray magnetic field@xcite . an alternative technique which can generate narrow dispersion like reference signal exploits circular dichroism of an atomic vapour in the presence of a magnetic field . in this technique , the difference of zeeman shifted saturated absorption signals generate the doppler free dichroic lock ( dfdl)signal@xcite .",
    "this technique requires only low magnetic field for its operation and is less sensitive to the surrounding stray magnetic field .",
    "however , the tuning range of this technique is limited to few natural linewidths of the transition .",
    "the tuning range can be increased by electronically adding an offset voltage to the signal or by optically changing the quarter wave plate axis relative to the polarisation beam splitter axis@xcite .",
    "the locking range can also be extended by either using doppler - broadened version of this technique known as dichroic atomic vapor laser lock ( davll)@xcite signal or by locking at positive as well as negative slopes of dfdl signal @xcite .",
    "another method involves increasing the magnetic field @xcite to extend the locking range of the dfdl signal .",
    "this frequency tuning is often achieved by compromising the slope of the signal which is a crucial parameter for frequency locking .",
    "a recently reported study on dfdl spectroscopy of d-2 line of @xmath0 includes coherence for calculation of line - shape of real atomic system @xcite .",
    "+ here , we present a technique which generates a narrow tunable dfdl ( tdfdl ) signal without compromising with the slope of the signal .",
    "the frequency tuning of this dispersion like tdfdl signal is achieved by varying the pump laser frequency using aoms .",
    "we have studied the dependence of this frequency locking signal s amplitude and the slope on various experimental parameters such as the pump beam power and the magnetic field .",
    "the locking performance of an extended cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) system is investigated by measuring change in the number of cold atoms in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) .",
    "a simple theoretical model to explain the generation of tdfdl signal is also presented .",
    "we adopt a simple two - level system involving hyperfine energy levels to explain the generation of tdfdl signal .",
    "a linearly polarized weak probe beam is overlapped by a counter - propagating strong pump beam in an atomic vapor cell placed in a weak magnetic field .",
    "the propagation of the probe beam is along the axis of magnetic field .",
    "the linearly polarized light can be resolved into two counter - rotating circular components @xmath1 using quarter wave plate and polarizing beam splitter . in the absence of magnetic field ( b=0 ) ,",
    "different @xmath2 states are degenerate and hence , @xmath3 and @xmath4 transitions overlap .",
    "when a small magnetic field ( few gauss ) is applied , the degeneracy is lifted and medium becomes dichroic due to the displacement of @xmath3 and @xmath4 transitions . as a result , the pair of spectrally shifted saturated absorption spectroscopy ( sas ) signals on subtraction generate the doppler free dispersion like signal@xcite . for atoms moving with velocity @xmath5 ,",
    "the doppler shifted laser frequency in the frame of moving atom becomes @xmath6 .",
    "when the laser beam passes through a rb atomic sample with a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution , only those atoms which fall within the homogeneous linewidth @xmath7 around the center frequency @xmath8 of rb atom at rest can significantly contribute to the absorption .",
    "+        if the pump beam having frequency ( @xmath9 ) and the probe beam having frequency ( @xmath10 ) are in counter propagating directions , the atoms having velocity components of @xmath11 along direction of the probe beam see different values of frequency detunings with the pump and the probe beams in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath1 polarized pump and the probe beams can interact resonantly with this group of atoms if , @xmath12 @xmath13 using equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the relation between the probe beam detuning @xmath14 and the pump beam detuning @xmath15 for resonant interaction is given by @xmath16 again using equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the difference between the pump and the probe beam detunings is given by , @xmath17 using equation ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , resonance condition for @xmath1 probe beam in presence of counter propagating pump beam and applied magnetic field can be written as @xmath18 therefore , the probe absorption signal will depend upon the difference between the pump and the probe beams detunings and the applied magnetic field .",

    "+        fig .",
    "2 shows the calculated tdfdl signal for different pump laser detuning . as the pump laser frequency is blue detuned with respect to the probe beam , the zero - crossing in dispersion like tdfdl signal",
    "will be shifted to red and vice versa .",
    "therefore , the zero crossing in tdfdl signal can be shifted to any frequency depending upon the pump laser detuning .",
    "further , fig .",
    "3 ( a ) and ( b ) shows the calculated amplitude and the slope of the tdfdl signal ( 12 mhz red detuned ) with the axial magnetic field respectively .",
    "we find that amplitude ( difference of maximum and minimum values ) of tdfdl signal initially increases with the applied magnetic field and gets saturated after certain value of the magnetic field .",
    "the amplitude of tdfdl signal reaches maximum value when sas for @xmath3 and @xmath4 probe beams is just separated by increasing the magnetic field .",
    "further , the slope of the tdfdl signal increases with magnetic field and reaches maximum value at magnetic field of @xmath49 4 gauss as shown in fig .",

    "the tdfdl experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "the external cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) ( dl100 , toptica ) system operating at 780 nm is used in our experiments .",
    "a combination of half wave plate and polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) is used to suitably divide laser output beam for its use in tdfdl setup , a reference sas setup and a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) setup .",
    "+ in tdfdl setup , laser light is split in two parts namely the pump laser beam and the probe laser beam using the combination of half wave plate and pbs .",
    "the pump laser beam is passed through a setup of two acousto - optical modulators ( aoms ) , aom-1 and aom-2 having frequency range of 60 to 100 mhz .",
    "the pump laser beam is initially passed through aom-1 .",
    "the first order ( + 1 ) diffracted beam of aom-1 is retro - reflected and passed again through aom-1 before going to pass through the second aom i.e. aom-2 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in aom-2 , the first order ( -1 )",
    "is made retro - reflected .",
    "thus , we have used both the aoms in double pass configuration to avoid deviation of the output beam .",
    "the output pump beam is overlapped with the probe laser beam in counter propagating direction inside a 5 cm long rb vapor cell placed inside the solenoid with crossing of @xmath49 10 @xmath57 .",
    "the probe laser beam is monitored using a @xmath58 wave plate and a pbs combination of elements and photo - diodes for detection of @xmath3 and @xmath4 parts of polarizations ( fig .",
    "the difference of two photo - diode signals gives dispersion like signal .",
    "the solenoid generates the longitudinal field of @xmath49 32 g / a . at the rb vapor cell",
    ", the probe and the pump laser beam has a diameter of 3 mm .",
    "neutral density filters are used to vary the pump laser beam power .",
    "the frequency tuning of the tdfdl signal is achieved by varying the frequency of the pump laser beam with the help of two aoms in double pass configuration as shown in fig .",
    "4 . the pump laser beam after double pass through aom-1 , gets a frequency shift of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is shift in first order diffraction in aom-1 . when this first order diffracted beam passes through aom-2 , the frequency shift is @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is shift in -1st order in aom-2 . therefore , the frequency of the pump beam is shifted by @xmath63 ( @xmath64 , relative to the probe beam frequency . therefore , as we observed , ( fig .",
    "5(a ) ) , there is no spectral shift in the tdfdl signal when aom-1 and aom-2 operate at the same frequency .",
    "this is because , the pump and the probe laser beam will be interacting with zero velocity group resulting a tdfdl signal as shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) ( solid curve ) . further , if aom-1 and aom-2 operate at frequency 100 mhz and 60 mhz respectively then frequency shift of pump beam ( @xmath63 ) as compared to the probe beam becomes + 80 mhz .",
    "therefore , tdfdl signal will be red shifted ( -40 mhz ) as shown by short dashed curve in fig .",
    "5(a ) . in the same way",
    ", tdfdl signal can be shifted to blue detuned ( + 40 mhz ) , as shown by dashed curve in fig .",
    "5(a ) , if aom-1 and aom-2 operate at frequency of 60 mhz and 100 mhz respectively .",
    "thus , observed detuning behaviour of tdfdl signal shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) is in good agreement with our theoretical results shown in fig .",
    "+ we have also observed that the slope and the amplitude of the signal remains nearly unchanged throughout the whole tuning range .",
    "thus , the frequency stability achieved using tdfdl reference signal is expected to be nearly independent of the frequency shifting used .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the sas signal where the slope and the amplitude changes with detuning from the resonance peak .",
    "it is shown in fig . 5b",
    "that slope of tdfdl signal is @xmath49 43 mv / mhz as compared to sas signal with slope of @xmath49 6 mv / mhz at -12 mhz detuning . here",
    ", we note that the relative difference in the detuning of the pump and the probe beams can also be introduced using two different lasers as reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , in that case the locking performance of one laser may influence the frequency stabilization of the other laser .",
    "we note that the tuning of laser frequency using a dfdl setup can also be achieved by changing the frequency of final laser beam using aoms . but this will be an inefficient method due to loss of power through aoms used in the final beam .",

    "is observed for magnetic fields larger than @xmath49 9.7 g as the separation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 transitions for the probe absorptions becomes more than a few natural widths .",
