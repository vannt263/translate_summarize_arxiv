    "it has long been conjectured , on both theoretical and observational grounds , that the outermost regions of the solar system may contain a large population of small icy bodies .",
    "for example , on the basis of theoretical considerations of the genesis of the planetary system from the primordial solar nebula , @xcite suggested that a remnant population of icy planetesimals left over from the planet - building process may exist at the current epoch beyond the orbit of neptune . @xcite and @xcite speculated on a massive comet belt as the source of unexplained perturbations of neptune s orbit [ although this argument must now be discarded as the post-_voyager _ revisions in the planetary ephemeris no longer show any unexplained residuals in neptune s motion ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "@xcite analyzed the orbital plane perturbations of comet p / halley and concluded that any comet belt between 40 au and 50 au has a total mass less than @xmath1 .",
    "this limit still allows for very large numbers  perhaps @xmath2  of cometary bodies .",
    "more recently , it has been suggested that the observed short period comets with orbital periods @xmath3 yr  the `` jupiter family '' comets  originate in a belt of low - inclination bodies just beyond the orbit of neptune , between 35 au and 50 au [ @xcite ] .",
    "the older hypothesis that short period comets originate in a population of near - parabolic oort cloud comets which are perturbed into shorter orbits by the giant planets appears unlikely : @xcite have shown that the orbital element distribution of the observed short period comets is inconsistent with a source in the nearly isotropic oort cloud but is compatible with a disk - like source in a trans - neptune comet belt , which they call the `` kuiper belt '' .",
    "a possible member of the kuiper belt was first discovered in 1992 at a distance of 41 au from the sun [ 1992 qb@xmath4 , reported in @xcite ] , and several additional discoveries have been reported since suggesting a potential population of @xmath5 bodies larger than @xmath6 km [ @xcite ] .",
    "the dynamical structure of this population has been the subject of several recent theoretical studies [ @xcite ] .",
    "the first two of these [ @xcite and @xcite ] , studied the long term stability of test particles in low - eccentricity and low - inclination orbits beyond neptune , subject only to the gravitational perturbations of the giant planets in their present orbital configuration .",
    "they found orbital instability on short timescales ( @xmath7 yr ) interior to 33 - 34 au , an intricate structure of interspersed regions of stability and instability in the semimajor axis range of 34 au to 43 au , and substantially stable orbits beyond 43 au .",
    "the intricacy of the dynamical structure appears to be particularly acute near the locations of orbital resonances with neptune .",
    "any primordial trans - neptune population of planetesimals was undoubtedly subject to dynamical evolution during the planet formation process , and the initial conditions assumed in the above studies are not necessarily representative of the state of the kuiper belt at the end of planet formation , as acknowledged in @xcite .",
    "the nature of the `` dynamical sculpting '' of the kuiper belt that would have occurred during the late stages of planet formation was the subject of a study by @xcite .",
    "this study concludes that the giant planets orbits would have evolved significantly and the kuiper belt would have been sculpted into a highly non - uniform distribution early in solar system history : most of the primordial small bodies in the region beyond neptune s orbit and up to approximately 50 au heliocentric distance would have been swept into narrow regions of orbital resonances with neptune , particularly the 3:2 and the 2:1 orbital resonances which are located at semimajor axes of approximately 39.4 au and 47.8 au , respectively .",
    "the orbital inclinations of most of these objects would remain low ( typically @xmath8 ) , but the eccentricities would be excited to significant values , typically @xmath9 .",
    "this structure would be largely preserved to the present epoch .",
    "pluto ( and its satellite charon ) have long been known to reside in the 3:2 neptune resonance ; the resonance libration protects this pair from close encounters with neptune , despite their neptune - crossing orbit ( with eccentricity @xmath10 ) .",
    "several of the newly - discovered kuiper belt objects are also likely residents of this resonance [ @xcite ] .",
    "( however , note that the orbital parameters of most of these objects remain rather poorly constrained pending future follow - up observations . )    in any case , it is clear that the locations of neptune s orbital resonances are particularly interesting with regard to the long term dynamics of the kuiper belt .    in the region between neptune s orbit and approximately 50 au heliocentric distance , by far",
    "the most important orbital perturbations are due to neptune alone , although the n - body effects of all the planets  particularly secular resonance effects  also surely play a significant role over the age of the solar system . in this paper ,",
    "i use the simplest possible dynamical model ",
    "namely , the circular , planar restricted three - body model  to determine the basic phase space structure near the locations of neptune s orbital resonances exterior to neptune s orbit .",
    "this model does not reflect the complexities that arise with ( i ) non - zero orbital inclination of the test particle , ( ii ) a realistic representation of neptune s motion ( its time - varying orbit ) , and ( iii ) the perturbations of the other planets . some of these unmodeled effects can lead to important variations in the dynamics .",
    "in particular , as mentioned above , secular resonances in certain regions of phase space can drive the inclinations and eccentricities to large amplitudes and further complicate the dynamics near mean motion resonances .",
    "nevertheless , this model is a reasonable first approximation because ( a ) the evidence from short period comets suggests a low - inclination source population , ( b ) in the trans - neptunian space , there are no first order orbital resonances with any other giant planets , and ( c ) neptune s eccentricity and inclination do not exceed @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , over billion year timescales under the effects of the mutual gravitational perturbations of the planets .",
    "the advantage of this simple model is that it is tractable : it allows for the calculation of 2-dimensional surfaces - of - section in which the phase space structure  in particular , the properties of resonance regions  can be easily visualized .",
    "this provides for relatively straightforward estimation of the widths of resonances and the determination of several interesting dynamical properties of resonant orbits , such as the libration periods and their dependence on orbital eccentricity and libration amplitude . to a considerable degree ,",
    "most of these properties are preserved in the more realistic situation . in short",
    ", this model provides a reasonable  baseline \" for the phase space structure in the trans - neptune region .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the technical details of the planar , circular restricted 3-body model for the sun , neptune and a kuiper belt object , including a description of the information that may be gleaned from surfaces - of - section .",
    "section 3 provides a detailed look at the phase space structure near the major neptune resonances of interest for the kuiper belt .",
    "section 4 summarizes and discusses the results .",
    "the classical planar circular restricted three - body problem is a particular case of the general gravitational three - body problem of masses @xmath13 defined by the following restrictions :    1 .   the motion of all three bodies takes place in a common plane ; 2 .",
    "the third body , @xmath14 , has zero mass ; therefore it does not influence the motion of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; and 3 .",

    "the system is made non - dimensional by the following choice of units :    * the unit of mass is taken to be @xmath17 ; * the unit of length is chosen to be , @xmath18 , the constant separation between @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( the mean heliocentric distance of neptune ) ; * the unit of time is chosen such that the orbital period of @xmath15 and @xmath16 about their center of mass is @xmath19",

    "the motion of the test particle takes place on a three - dimensional subspace ( defined by a particular value of @xmath36 ) embedded in the four - dimensional phase space , @xmath37 . the usual two - dimensional surface - of - section ( s - o - s )",
    "is defined by @xmath38 and the coordinates on the section are @xmath39 .",

    "let us consider the neptune - pluto 3:2 resonance as an illustrative example . if pluto s inclination is neglected , and if one assumes a fixed circular orbit for neptune , then the jacobi integral @xmath49 for the sun+neptune+pluto restricted three - body problem .",
    "figure 1(a ) is a s - o - s in the neighborhood of the 3:2 neptune resonance for this value of @xmath36 .",
    "this section shows examples of all three types of orbits .",
    "the center of the smooth curves lying near @xmath50 corresponds to the periodic orbit whose period is exactly 3/2 that of neptune .",
    "the smooth curves are quasiperiodic orbits surrounding this exact periodic orbit and represent test particle orbits that librate about the exact resonance ; the size of a smooth curve bears a direct relationship to the amplitude of libration . such librating orbits are phase - protected from having close encounters with neptune even if the orbit is neptune - crossing .",
    "it can be seen that , in general , the regions of quasiperiodic orbits are surrounded by chaotic orbits , beyond a certain libration amplitude , the smooth curves dissolve into a chaotic zone . embedded within the `` chaotic sea '' are other stable zones or chains - of - islands that represent other nearby higher order and secondary resonances .",
    "the origin of the chaos is due to the overlap of the higher - order and secondary resonances .",
    "it is perhaps more meaningful to visualize the resonance zone in variables that can be more directly translated into `` resonance width '' .",
    "the latter is traditionally ( and somewhat loosely ) defined as the range in semimajor axis where the orbital perturbations are large . in the restricted three - body problem with @xmath51 , this is the range in which the amplitude of the orbital parameter variations of the test particle is not simply linearly proportional to @xmath22 , but is @xmath52 with @xmath53 . in general , in the neighborhood of any resonance , we find regions of stable , librating orbits surrounded by a substantial chaotic zone where test particles may suffer close encounters with neptune . in this paper",
    ", i will define the resonance half - width @xmath48 as the maximum amplitude of the semimajor axis variations of _ stably librating _ resonant orbits .",
    "the value of @xmath48 will be estimated from the s - o - s as described below .",
    "the phase space structure seen in the @xmath39 plane can also be seen in other ( generalized ) canonical coordinates .",
    "for example , in plane polar coordinates the equivalent s - o - s @xmath54 in the inertial reference frame is @xmath55 with the same section condition as in eqn .",
    "[ eq : sos ] . the s - o - s condition can be rewritten in terms of polar coordinates as follows : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the longitude of neptune , and @xmath58 is the mean motion of the test particle . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath55 plane is equivalent to the @xmath39 plane with points plotted at every conjunction of the test particle with neptune .",
    "the @xmath55 s - o - s is shown in figure 1(b ) .    carrying this one step further by means of a canonical transformation to delaunay variables , @xmath59 ) where @xmath60 are the mean anomaly and",
    "mean longitude and @xmath61 ( cf .",
    "chapter xvii in @xcite and chapter 10 in @xcite ) , this same section can also be seen in the @xmath62 plane . the @xmath62 s - o - s",
    "is shown in figure 1(c ) .",
    "it is evident from the latter figure that for pluto - like resonance - locked orbits ( for the particular value of @xmath36 chosen in this s - o - s ) the mean anomaly at conjunctions with neptune librates about @xmath63 and its maximum libration amplitude is @xmath64 .",
    "orbits with larger amplitudes are chaotic .",
    "in addition to the maximum amplitude of @xmath65 , the resonance libration region is bounded in @xmath66 as well .",
    "now , if we note that ( i ) the jacobi integral provides a relationship between @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see eqn .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) ) , and ( ii ) for a particular orbital resonance defined by the ratio @xmath40 of the orbital periods of the test particle and neptune , the librating orbits all have a phase - averaged semimajor axis @xmath67 , then any s - o - s can be labeled uniquely either by the value of @xmath36 or , in the neighborhood of a particular orbital resonance , by the value of @xmath68 ( with the understanding that @xmath67 ) .",
    "for example , for the s - o - s in figure 1 , we have @xmath49 ; near the 3:2 resonance , @xmath69 ; therefore , from eqn .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) we have @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the phase space structure in the neighborhood of a particular orbital resonance can be systematically studied in a set of surfaces - of - section where all of them have a common value of @xmath71 but various values of @xmath68 ( hence different values of @xmath36 ) .",
    "this allows a visualization of the phase space near an orbital resonance as a function of the mean orbital eccentricity .    finally , in figure 1(d )",
    "i have plotted the values of @xmath33 against @xmath65 for the same points represented in figures 1(a  c ) . _ note",
    "that this is not a surface - of - section .",
    "_ one might call it a `` pseudo - surface - of - section '' , for @xmath33 is not a canonical variable",
    ". however , the constancy of @xmath36 imposes a relationship between @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( cf .",
    "[ eq : c ] ) which ensures that this plot looks very similar to the @xmath62 s - o - s in figure 1(b ) and the stable libration regions and the chaotic regions are easily distinguished .",
    "the reason for choosing this non - canonical variable is that the resonance width @xmath48 of the stable libration zone can be readily determined from this figure .",
    "therefore , the @xmath72 plane  the pseudo - surface - of - section  will be used in the next section for a systematic look at the properties of the phase space in the neighborhood of several neptune resonances .",
    "the libration timescale in the libration zone and the timescale for orbital instability in the chaotic zone are of particular interest for the dynamics of kuiper belt objects .",
    "these libration timescales have been determined for individual resonances and are also given in the next section .",
    "typically , the timescale for orbital instability inside the chaotic zone surrounding a resonance is only a few times the libration period .",
    "however , close to the boundary between the libration zone and the chaotic zone , this timescale can become exceedingly large .",
    "in particular , for pluto - like orbits with eccentricity @xmath10 in the 3:2 neptune resonance , the timescale for instability in the chaotic zone ( for amplitude of the resonance angle greater than @xmath73 ) is @xmath74 yr , but close to the edge of the libration zone this timescale increases by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "in principle , there is an infinite number of orbital resonances in the three - body problem .",
    "however , we will see that only a handful warrant any detailed investigation .",
    "low - eccentricity orbits in the immediate neighborhood of a planet are unstable .",
    "there is a simple explanation for this orbital instability that follows from chirikov s ( 1979 ) `` resonance overlap criterion '' : first order @xmath75 resonances with @xmath76 overlap completely [ @xcite ] .",
    "[ numerical experiments by @xcite show that the numerical coefficient on the right hand side in this relation must be revised to 0.44 ] .",
    "complete overlap of neighboring resonances results in the destabilization of all periodic and quasi - periodic orbits in the neighborhood of those resonances . in other words ,",
    "circular test particle orbits are unstable in the immediate neighborhood @xmath77 of a planet s orbit . for neptune ( @xmath24 ) , this criterion shows that all first order resonances with @xmath78 are completely overlapping , so that circular orbits beyond neptune with orbital radii less than about 33 au are unstable .",
    "therefore , beyond the semimajor axis range of about 33 au , at most only seven first order @xmath75 resonances with @xmath79 are isolated from each other ( at least for low eccentricities ) .",
    "however , i have found numerically that low - eccentricity orbits at the 8:7 and 7:6 neptune resonances are also chaotic .",
    "this is not entirely surprising , for the resonance overlap criterion is quite approximate , and wisdom s scaling law is strictly valid only in the asymptotic limit @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , only five first order @xmath75 resonances with @xmath81 are of potential significance for the long - term storage of kuiper belt objects .",
    "furthermore , since all second and higher order resonances in the first - order resonance overlap region are also destroyed , it follows that there are only seven second order neptune resonances of potential interest : @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "of these , i have found numerically that only three ( 3:1 , 5:3 , and 7:5 ) have resonance widths @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the phase space in the neighborhood of only these three second order resonances will be discussed here .",
    "figures 310 show the properties of these first and second order neptune resonances .",
    "they are arranged in order of decreasing mean heliocentric distance .",
    "each figure has seven parts : the first four [ ( a)(d ) ] show the resonance zones in the pseudo - surfaces - of - section [ plots of @xmath72 ] for @xmath86 and 0.4 , respectively ; note that the vertical scale is the same in all these figures , so that the variations in the extent of the libration and chaotic zones with @xmath68 and with the mean distance of the resonance from neptune can be readily discerned .",
    "the next two panels [ ( e ) and ( f ) ] show examples of librating , resonance - locked orbits in the rotating reference frame .",
    "the last one , panel ( g ) , shows the period of libration as a function of the mean orbital eccentricity and the amplitude of libration of the resonance angle , @xmath87 . a few words are in order regarding the latter variable .    for a @xmath40 resonance",
    "the resonance angle is defined as follows : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the mean longitude and longitude of perihelion of the test particle , and @xmath91 is the mean longitude of neptune .",
    "( note that @xmath42 is a positive integer ; @xmath43 is a negative integer for interior resonances , positive for exterior resonances ; the latter are the only resonances of interest in this paper . )",
    "@xmath87 is the natural variable that arises in the perturbative analysis of orbital resonances , and it can be used to make a first approximation theory that models the resonant motion of the test particle with a single degree - of - freedom pendulum - like dynamical system [ see @xcite ] . for a test particle locked in a stable exterior resonance ,",
    "@xmath87 librates about a mean value which is usually @xmath63 .",
    "[ there are two exceptions to this : ( i ) for sufficiently high eccentricity , librations of the resonance angle about @xmath92 are also possible ; and ( ii ) the 2:1 and the 3:1 resonances allow for asymmetric librations where the center of libration of the resonance angle is displaced away from @xmath63 . these are discussed further below .",
    "] at conjunctions with neptune , the resonance angle is related to the mean anomaly : @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , the librations or chaotic variations of @xmath65 evident in the surfaces - of - section are also reflected in the behavior of @xmath87 .",
    "the physical significance of the resonance angle can be seen by noting that when the test particle is at perihelion , @xmath94 , so that @xmath95 thus , the behavior of @xmath87 gives a direct measure of the longitude separation of neptune from the test particle s perihelion .",
    "this is obviously a critical quantity , especially for high - eccentricity neptune - crossing orbits , as the stable libration of @xmath87 then ensures that the particle is protected from catastrophic close encounters with neptune .",
    "the maximum excursion from the center of libration of @xmath87 then gives a measure of the smallest possible separation between neptune and the test particle s perihelion in stable resonance - protected orbits .",
    "the resonance libration period as a function of the amplitude of libration of @xmath87 is shown for various values of @xmath68 in the last panel ( g ) of figures 310 .",
    "these curves are rather counter - intuitive .",
    "recall that in the oft - used pendulum model for non - linear resonances , the pendulum libration period increases monotonically with amplitude and becomes arbitrarily large close to the separatrix ( the orbit that separates the oscillations from rotations of the pendulum ) .",
    "in contrast , in figures 310(g ) , we see that , except for the asymmetric librations at the 2:1 and 3:1 resonances , the libration period in general _ decreases _ with increasing libration amplitude .",
    "furthermore , near a @xmath43-th order resonance , the leading order ( in eccentricity ) resonance term in the perturbing potential for the test particle is proportional to the @xmath43-th power of the eccentricity , hence the small - amplitude libration period might be expected to vary as @xmath96 ; this analogy from the pendulum model does not hold either , as evident in figures 310(g ) .",
    "thus , the standard non - linear pendulum model should be used with caution for orbital resonances .",
    "the general characteristics of the phase space near these first and second order neptune resonances are summarized as follows .",
    "( note that the 2:1 and the 3:1 resonances are exceptional in many respects , and are discussed later in detail . )    * in general , the phase space in the neighborhood of a resonance contains a zone of stably librating , resonance - locked orbits surrounded by a zone of chaotic orbits .",
    "the width of the resonance zone ( including the stable as well as the chaotic regions ) increases with @xmath68 ; however , the width of the libration zone , in general , shrinks as the resonance separatrix dissolves into a chaotic layer that increases in thickness with @xmath68 .",

    "figure 3 ) are very similar to that near the 2:1 resonance ; some specifics are noted below .    * the resonance half - width , @xmath48 , increases  from @xmath116 to @xmath117  as @xmath68 increases from @xmath104 to @xmath105 . the phase space at this resonance is regular ; there is no discernible chaotic zone for this range of eccentricities . * for librating orbits ,",
    "perihelion and aphelion occur at approximately the same longitude relative to neptune . as in the 2:1 resonance",
    ", there are two types of librating orbits  the symmetric and asymmetric librators ; however , the asymmetric librations appear only at @xmath68 exceeding @xmath118 . *",
    "the small amplitude libration periods are very long ( @xmath119 myr ) for low eccentricity @xmath120 orbits , but considerably shorter ( 30,00080,000 yr ) for higher eccentricities .",
    "numerical studies of the stability of low eccentricity , low inclination orbits of small objects in the trans - neptunian kuiper belt subject to the gravitational perturbations of the giant planets have shown that the inner edge of the kuiper belt is at about 34 au heliocentric distance ; beyond 34 au and up to about 42 au there are interspersed regions of stability and instability [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "this structure bears a complex correlation with the locations of neptune orbital resonances .",
    "other studies [ @xcite , @xcite ] suggest that early in the history of the solar system , the majority of kuiper belt objects were swept into eccentric orbits in narrow zones located at neptune s orbital resonances , and that the regions in - between the resonances would have been largely cleared of residual planetesimals .",
    "recent and ongoing observational surveys of the outer solar system indicate the presence of a large population of small bodies beyond neptune [ @xcite ] . these are quite likely the source of short period comets [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "furthermore , their orbital distribution is likely to hold clues to the formation and early dynamical evolution of the outer solar system [ @xcite ] .",
    "all of these considerations have motivated the present study .    using the planar circular restricted three body model ( with the sun , neptune and a test particle ) ,",
    "i have described in this paper the basic phase space structure in the neighborhood of neptune s exterior orbital resonances .",
    "the details may be gleaned from figures 310 .",
    "a succinct summary of these results is given in figure 11 which shows the locations and widths of the stable resonance libration zones .",
    "in general , these stable zones are bounded by chaotic layers of thickness that generally increases with eccentricity and decreases with distance from neptune .",
    "( as the mean semimajor axis and eccentricity of chaotic orbits is not well defined , it is not possible to represent the chaotic layers in such a figure . )",
    "the planar circular restricted three body model is the simplest dynamical model for the orbital dynamics of small objects in the kuiper belt .",
    "although this model may appear oversimplified , it provides a reasonable description and explanation for much of the dynamical behaviors found in the numerical studies mentioned above .",
    "for example , the location of the inner edge of this belt at @xmath121(3334 ) au is readily understood in terms of orbital instability induced by overlapping first order neptune resonances ; the additional perturbations due to neptune s non - circular , inclined , and time - varying orbit and the perturbations of the other planets do not significantly change the location of this boundary .",
    "the relatively isolated first and second order neptune resonances beyond 34 au ( in semimajor axis ) provide narrow stable libration regions for the long term storage of kuiper belt objects in eccentric ( often neptune - crossing ) orbits .",
    "this paper provides first approximation estimates for the locations and widths of these regions , and for the dynamical properties of resonant orbits .",
    "it also provides a direct visualization  in two - dimensional surfaces - of - section  of the global phase space structure ( the chaotic and stable regions ) in the vicinity of orbital resonances a characteristic of stable resonant orbits is the libration of the perihelion about a longitude well removed from neptune s location .",
    "typical libration periods are several tens - of - thousands of years .",
    "the libration zones are generally surrounded by narrow chaotic zones where orbits are unstable on timescales of a few libration periods , or @xmath122 yr . at the boundary between the stable resonance libration zone and the chaotic zone",
    ", the timescale for orbital instability may be exceedingly long .",
    "this paper also provides a quantitative analysis of libration periods and their dependence on libration amplitudes and orbital eccentricities at all the major exterior mean motion resonances of neptune .",
    "of course , the planar circular restricted three body model does not provide a complete picture .",
    "indeed , i expect that it underestimates the extent of the chaotic zones and overestimates the sizes of the stable libration zones near neptune resonances .",
    "but perhaps the most important missing element is the effect of secular resonances [ see @xcite ] on the long term dynamics of kuiper belt objects . for example , in some regions , secular resonances produce significant inclination excitation ; in such cases , the assumption of planarity becomes a poor approximation .",
    "[ pluto s orbit is a case in point ( @xcite ) . ] in order to discern these effects , one has to build much more elaborate analytical models or resort to extensive numerical integrations .",
    "as this work was being completed , i became aware of two preprints [ @xcite and @xcite ] on the same subject .",
    "these use different approaches to the problem : the present work has focussed on the phase space near mean motion resonances with neptune only and gives results that are exact but for a highly simplified physical model ; @xcite discuss the dynamics near mean motion resonances as well as secular resonances using primarily approximate semi - analytic models ; and @xcite discuss the dynamics near mean motion resonances , secular resonances as well as non - resonant regions using a purely numerical approach .",
    "a comparison of the present work with these two preprints follows .",
    "morbidelli ( 1995 ) describe semi - analytic and numerical investigations that include the effects of all four giant planets on the dynamics of test particles in the kuiper belt .",
    "a comparison of their results for the locations and widths of mean motion resonances ( see their figure 1 ) with the estimates obtained here ( cf .  figure 11 ) shows that their models significantly overestimate the sizes of the resonance libration regions .",
    "s estimates of the resonance widths were obtained by averaging the planar , circular restricted problem of the four giant planets plus a test particle over fast variables , retaining only the dependence on the resonance angle .",
    "thus , their analysis does not account for the overlapping secondary resonances at the edges of the mean motion resonance libration zones that produce a chaotic layer and cause the libration regions to shrink rapidly with increasing eccentricity .",
    "this is the explanation for the differences between their figure 1 and figure 11 here .",
    "in addition , morbidelli find a singularity in the averaged hamiltonian that causes a great increase in the resonance width near neptune - crossing values of the eccentricity .",
    "however , this is an artifact , and does not appear in the unaveraged problem , as is obvious from the surfaces - of - section shown in the present work",
    ". the technique i used here does not make any averaging approximations , but uses the full unaveraged hamiltonian for the circular planar restricted problem , albeit without the secular effects of jupiter , saturn and uranus .",
    "_ s models also show that secular effects are negligible near mean motion resonances except in the case of the 3:2 neptune resonance . in the special case of the 3:2 resonance ,",
    "as mentioned above , @xcite had previously shown the existence of the @xmath123 secular resonance embedded within the mean motion resonance ; in addition , analysis of pluto s orbit had also previously revealed the existence of another resonance characterized by the libration of the argument of perihelion ( @xcite ) .",
    "both of these resonances have the effect of exciting the inclination of the test particle .",
    "these resonances are not modeled in the present work , but morbidelli describe in some detail the location and widths of both these and other secular resonances",
    ". however , note that because most regions near secular resonances are regions of orbital instability , they are not likely to be of importance as reservoirs of kuiper belt objects although they may drive their transport to small heliocentric distances at the present epoch .    duncan ( 1995 ) have performed quite extensive numerical integrations of test particle orbits subject to the gravitational perturbations of the four giant planets .",
    "they describe their results in terms of the stability ( over their integration time of 14 byr ) of orbits with particular initial semimajor axes , eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "their main conclusions are consistent with the results of the present work : namely , that particles with low initial inclination ( @xmath124 ) and initial perihelion distance less than @xmath125 au are unstable on timescales short compared to the age of the solar system , except that particles librating in low order mean motion resonances with neptune remain phase - protected from close encounters with that planet .",
    "they have also analyzed the 3:2 neptune resonance in more detail for the particular case with initial eccentricities of 0.2 and found three regimes : stable orbits deep in resonance with small libration amplitudes , @xmath126 ; an intermediate region with libration amplitudes in the range @xmath127 where the timescale for instability is @xmath128 yr ; and highly unstable orbits for libration amplitudes exceeding @xmath129 with stability timescales of @xmath130 yr .",
    "similar dynamics is found for all the neptune resonances studied in this paper . in comparison",
    ", the present work has shown that the region of stability deep in resonance as well as the highly chaotic region at large amplitudes are both explained by the perturbations of neptune alone ( assumed to be on a circular orbit ) ; the intermediate regime where the timescale for instability is @xmath128 yr is very small in the restricted three body model but evidently expands greatly ( at the expense of the stable libration zone ) in the full n - body model for the outer solar system .",
    "[ in this context , we note that if malhotra s ( 1995 ) theory for the orbital distribution of kuiper belt objects is correct , then this intermediate libration amplitude regime which allows a long - term leakage of resonant objects may be the primary source of the jupiter - family short - period comets . ]",
    "duncan also find that the resonance - protection fails only at inclinations exceeding @xmath131 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the planar circular restricted three body model used in the present work provides a fairly good description of these main trends .",
    "a clear advantage of this simple model is that its analysis is quite `` inexpensive '' compared to the months of cpu time expended in the numerical simulations by duncan furthermore , the numerical integration of orbits for the age of the solar system at sufficiently high resolution in the space of initial conditions remains beyond the reach of present - day computers , as acknowledged by duncan thus , the global picture of the phase space structure obtained in the present work provides an inexpensive yet reasonably good baseline for understanding the dynamics in the trans - neptunian solar system , and is particularly useful near mean motion resonances .",
