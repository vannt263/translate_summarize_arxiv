    "we observe that the electron transmission is very small near the bottom of conduction band ( @xmath65ev ) where the electron waves mostly get reflected at the boundary , while the transmission probability sharply rises up in increasing the fermi level .",

    "[ fig : total_trans_3 ] which plots the total transmission @xmath56 as a function of electron density . in fig .",
    "[ fig : total_trans_3 ] , we also compare the total transmission for the ab - ba domain boundary ( blue ) with that for the uniform ab bilayer graphene without domain boundary ( black ) .",
    "we see that , that ratio of the former to the latter is almost zero near the zero energy , while rapidly increases at higher energy levels .",
    "this result suggests that the existence of the domain boundary dramatically reduces the conductivity of the bilayer graphene near the charge neutral point .",
    "these characteristic features can be roughly explained from two different aspects .",
    "first , we generally expect a bigger transmission in a smoothly changing boundary than in the sharply changing boundary .",
    "the smoothness / sharpness is characterized by the ratio of the wave length of the incident wave @xmath66 to the width of the boundary region @xmath9 . in the low fermi energy ( @xmath65ev ) , the effective wavenumber measured from @xmath63 point is about @xmath67 , and then the wavelength @xmath68 nm is actually larger than the width of boundary region at @xmath13 nm ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "so this case is regarded as a sharp boundary , suggesting that we have a considerable reflection . in increasing the fermi level",
    ", the ratio @xmath69 simply decreases , i.e. , the boundary becomes relatively smoother and gives a larger transmission .",
    "another important aspect is the wavenumber matching in local fermi surface.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary_trilayer ] , we see that the stacking structure gradually changes from ab to ba in increasing @xmath16 , and the local structure at any particular @xmath16 approximates the uniform bilayer graphene with a certain interlayer translation .",
    "then we can consider the local fermi surface corresponding to the local atomic structure as a function of @xmath16 , which is shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : tglvstgp ] . at @xmath65",
    "ev , for instance , the fermi surface in the intermediate region shifts along the @xmath40 direction , leaving only a small overlap with initial fermi surface when projected to @xmath40 axis . as a result ,",
    "for a traveling wave of @xmath40 off the overlapping region does not have corresponding traveling waves in the intermediate region , then it does not reach the other side .",
    "meanwhile , at higher fermi levels , the intermediate fermi surface better overlaps with the initial one on the @xmath40 axis , so that the boundary becomes more transparent .",
    "the correspondence between the transmission and the band structure is only approximate , but the agreement should become almost perfect when @xmath9 becomes much larger than the typical wavelength . to see this , we calculate the transmission probability at various widths of boundary region , @xmath9 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : width_changing_gapless6 ] , we show the transmission probability in the top panel , and the local band structure in the bottom .",
    "the blue shading indicates the region of @xmath40 which has traveling modes throughout the intermediate region . for small boundary region w = 8.7 nm ( @xmath12 )",
    ", we still have a finite transmission probability in the region outside of the blue shading region , because there the wavelength @xmath66 is actually larger than @xmath9 as already argued , and thus the local fermi surface is not well defined . increasing @xmath9 , the transmission outside the shaded region vanishes , and at the same time the transmission probability in the shaded region rapidly rises and reaches almost 1 at @xmath70 nm .",
    "this is because the wave is hardly reflected in a smoothly - changing boundary which is much longer than the electron wave length , as long as a traveling mode exists throughout the intermediate region .",
    "next , we apply a perpendicular external electric field to the system by adding the asymmetric electrostatic potential @xmath71 and @xmath72 to the top and bottom layers . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_band_2 ] ( b ) , @xmath73 actually opens up a band gap between the touching conduction and valance band , and near the band edge , the energy dispersion exhibits a complex feature where the fermi surface split into several different parts due to the trigonal warping . @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : tglvstgp ] ( b ) , we compare the transmission probabilities in gapped case ( @xmath59 ) and that in gapless case ( @xmath57 ev ) at the two different electron densities . at the lower density @xmath74@xmath1",
    ", we have two right - going channels in the gapped case so that we plot multiple transmission probablities @xmath47 , @xmath75 , and @xmath52 .",

    "the total transmission calculation in fig .",
    "[ fig : total_trans_3 ] also shows that the suppression at low electron density observed in the gapless case is considerably relaxed in the gapped case , suggesting that applying the external electric field definitely increases the electron transmission near the charge neutral point .",
    "here it should be noted that the total electron transmission can be changed purely by deforming the band structure , with the electron density fixed .",
    "this feature can also be explained in terms of the local fermi surface structure shown in the lower panels fig .",
    "[ fig : tglvstgp ] . at @xmath76 @xmath1 ,",
    "the fermi surface spreads in a wider @xmath77-space region than in gapless case due to the complex structure of band bottom .",
    "this results in a shorter fermi wavelength and also a better overlap with the intermediate fermi surface , and both of them contribute to a larger transmission .    .",

    "the situation is schematically illustrated in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : totaltrans_multi ] ( d ) shows the ratio of the transmission with the boundary to without the boundary .",
    "the overall behavior in the trilayer boundary is pretty much similar to the bilayer case , i.e. , the transmission is suppressed near the charge neutral point and gradually rises at the high fermi energy . in adding more layer , however , we see that the reduction near @xmath83 becomes gradually weaker .",
    "it is a natural consequence because the wave amplitude per single layer becomes relatively smaller in a larger stack so that the transmission is less sensitive to the existence of the domain boundary on the surface layer .",

    "[ fig : totaltrans_multi ] ( d ) , where the boundaries with even number of layers show relatively better transmission than in the odd layers .",

    "we notice that the odd layer always has one more channel in left region than in right region , and this is due to the existence of the monolayer - like band in bernal stacked odd layer graphene .",

    "this suggests that the reflection matrix elements between the linear band and the other bands are particularly strong , and it significantly interferes the total transmission . the strong reflection in presence of the linear band",
    "is presumably related to the fact that a linear band state has a relatively large wave amplitude on the surface layer compared to other bands .",
    "@xcite this fact explains why the transmission at the high carrier density is generally higher in even layer cases where the linear band state is absent .",

    "our result indicates the electron transmission in a general graphitic system is significantly supressed in presence of domain boundaries .",
    "the present result also suggests that a boundary between two different stacking structures may provide a mechanism to control the electron current on multilayer graphene . in particular , the fact that the system being almost insulator near bottom of conduction band and quickly becoming transparent when increasing fermi levels gives a possibility to be applied to switching devices .",
