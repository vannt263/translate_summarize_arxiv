    "the short  observation presented here does not reveal much about the nature of .",
    "those point sources detected primarily in soft x - rays ( @xmath44  kev ) are likely to be coronal , with late - type stellar counterparts identified in table  [ chandra_tab ] , and unrelated to .",
    "the one hard x - ray source without an optical counterpart ( # 7 in table  [ chandra_tab ] ) could be a background agn .",
    "the position of source 7 is consistent with the well - determined ( @xmath8 ) location of the centroid of the tev emission .",
    "however , the extended and steady nature of disfavors a blazar origin .",
    "the absence of a brighter x - ray counterpart argues against a microquasar origin , but perhaps allows an isolated compact object .",
    "no diffuse source is apparent in the  image , thus , there is no further evidence concerning the extended tev emission , and whether it has an electronic or hadronic origin .",
    "based on their spin - down fluxes @xmath45 , none of the known pulsars in the  field ( table  [ pulsar_tab ] ) is a good candidate for powering detectable tev emission from a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) . the highest spin - down flux is from psr j1301@xmath06305 , which has @xmath46 ergs  @xmath2  s@xmath3 , and would imply an unreasonably high efficiency of @xmath47 for production of @xmath48 tev flux , which is @xmath49 ergs  @xmath2  s@xmath3 according to the extrapolated spectrum @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "sets an upper limit on the 2@xmath010 kev flux of each of these pulsars of @xmath50 ergs  @xmath2  s@xmath3 , which is consistent with the normal range of @xmath51 for pulsars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is an empirical threshold @xmath52 of @xmath53 ergs  s@xmath3 below which pulsars do not power bright pwn either in x - rays or in radio @xcite .",
    "none of the pulsars in table  [ pulsar_tab ] , including psr j1301@xmath06305 , exceeds this threshold .",
    "it is instructive to compare this observation of  to a similar 5  ks  observation of the hegra source , the first unidentified tev source .",
    "is located near the cygnus ob2 region , in which several of the stars are among the most active stellar x - ray sources in the galaxy .",
    "in contrast to , the  field contains more point x - ray sources , spectroscopic optical identifications of which indicated that they are mostly a mix of o - type stars in the cyg ob2 association , at @xmath54  kpc , and foreground late - type stars @xcite .",
    "the only unusual x - ray source in the field of  is a highly variable , hard and absorbed x - ray source , the brightest in the  image , located @xmath55 from the centroid of .",
    "it is not clear if this unidentified x - ray source is associated with .",
    "if so , @xcite argued that it would be located considerably beyond cyg ob2 , and still be within the young galactic disk .",
    "it has been argued that colliding stellar winds in the cyg ob2 association could be responsible for the production of tev gamma - rays in  @xcite .",
    "@xcite hypothesized two possible origins for extended tev emission that may be displaced from its originating source of energy .",
    "one is @xmath56 decay resulting from hadrons accelerated in shocked ob star winds and interacting with a local , dense cloud .",
    "the other is tev emission in a jet - driven termination shock due to inverse compton scattering , either from an as - yet undetected microquasar , or from cyg x-3 .",
    "@xcite theorized that groups of stars in ob associations located close to cosmic ray acceleration sites may be sources of tev emission , and cited  as a candidate for such a source .",
    "in such a scenario , no mev - gev emission is expected from the source at egret or _",
    "glast _ energies .",
    "the hegra source  also showed some evidence for spatial extent , with a gaussian @xmath26 radius of @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "as in the case of , the hegra source was found to be steady in observations from 1999 to 2001 , unlike the flaring blazars detected by egret and the iacts .",
    "however , unlike ,  is not located near a dense ob stellar association or a star formation region .",
    "although @xcite noted that  is superposed on the centaurus ob1 association , this is a rather sparse group of only 20 stars , mostly of type b , spread over @xmath58 or 260 pc at the adopted distance of 2.5 kpc @xcite ( 2.3  kpc according to @xcite ) .",
    "the nearest member is @xmath59 from .",
    "therefore , we hesitate to posit a physical origin of the small tev source from the group as a whole , or even from any existing member . also , the average visual extinction to stars in cen ob1 is only @xmath60  mag @xcite , which is not large enough to account for the absence of an x - ray counterpart at this distance .",
    "however , it is possible that a deceased member of the association , whose compact remnant is difficult to detect , is responsible for .",
    "that both  and  are indeed galactic now seems secure .",
    "it is likely that several more such sources will be detected in future sky surveys to be conducted by h.e.s.s . and veritas .",
    "such tev sources may not be associated with the numerous unidentified egret sources in the 3eg catalog , and could very well comprise a new class by themselves . given the apparent latitude range of @xmath61 , their scale height must be @xmath62  pc if located at distances @xmath63  kpc .",
    "thus , they are not very old , and probably originate from massive stars or their remnants .    after this paper",
    "was submitted , the discovery by h.e.s.s . of eight additional sources in a survey of the galactic plane was reported @xcite .",
    "their mean galactic latitude of @xmath64 and rms dispersion in latitude of @xmath65 further supports an association with young , massive stars .",
    "all of these new sources appear to be extended , and some are plausibly associated with known supernova remnants , which suggests that the remaining unidentified sources might also be supernova remnants that have not yet been detected or recognized at longer wavelengths because of their considerable distances and/or weak synchrotron emission . the search for and evaluation of candidate counterparts will be very important in resolving the nature of these tev sources .",
