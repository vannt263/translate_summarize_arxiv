    "stars at the very bottom of the main sequence have been a very popular topic of research during the last few years , including in studies of stellar activity .",
    "fleming , schmitt , & giampapa ( 1995 ) demonstrated that fully - convective m dwarfs , i.e. those with masses less than 0.3 m@xmath3 , exhibit high levels of coronal activity , although at that time , virtually no x - ray detections had been made of stars less massive than vb 8 and lhs 3003 ( both type m7 . ) the star vb 10 ( a.k.a .",
    "gl 752 b , lhs 474 ; type m8 ) appeared to have been marginally detected once by the einstein high resolution imager and was catalogued by barbera et al .",
    "then linsky et al .",
    "( 1995 ) reported the detection of a large amplitude flare on vb 10 in the far uv using the goddard high resolution spectrograph .",
    "more recently , neuhauser & comron ( 1998 ) have detected x - ray emission from a very young brown dwarf in chameleon .",
    "this confirms that activity does exist for the very lowest mass stellar ( or substellar ) configurations .",
    "we have used the rosat high resolution imager ( hri ) to reobserve vb 10 , which was not detected by the rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) during either the all - sky survey or a 7.3-ksec pointed observation ( fleming et al . 1993 ) . by obtaining a deeper exposure",
    ", we hoped to discover the nature of the vb 10 corona , detect its quiescent x - ray luminosity , and compare its level of coronal activity to that of the more massive m dwarfs .",
    "we have succeded in detecting x - ray emission from vb 10 , but only during a brief flare similar to the one observed by linsky et al .",
    "( 1995 ) at ultraviolet wavelengths .    in this paper",
    ", we present the latest rosat data on vb 10 .",
    "section 2 contains a description of the observations and data analysis . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss a hypothesis to account for the stark contrast between the flare and non - flare x - ray flux values , including the possibility of a total lack of @xmath2 k coronal plasma about vb 10 .",
    "the star vb 10 was observed during the period of 1997 october 27 - 31 for a total of 21,992 sec with the rosat hri ( zombeck et al . 1990 ) .",
    "the total image is shown in fig .",
    "1a . the one obvious x - ray source seen in fig .",
    "1 is positionally coincident with the star wolf 1055 ( type m3.5 ve ) , which has a common proper motion with vb 10 . at the position of vb 10 , which is marked in fig .",
    "1a , there is only a marginal detection . however , when the data are separated into their individual observation intervals ( obis ) , we find that all of the photons in the vb 10 detection are contained within one single obi ( figs .",
    "1b and 1c ) .",
    "this particular obi , which began on ut 1997 october 29 at 3:05:24 and ended at 3:25:43 , had an effective total exposure time of 1,138 sec . within an extraction radius of @xmath4 around the optical position of vb 10",
    ", 11 photons were detected . by examining the rest of the image",
    ", we determined that the density of background photons for this obi was 0.0024 cts arcs@xmath5 .",
    "the solid angle of our extraction circle about vb 10 was 452.4 arcs@xmath6 , which means that we would expect one photon in the extraction circle to be from the background .",
    "therefore , with 10 source photons , the mean count rate over the entire obi is @xmath7 cts s@xmath1 ( this includes a deadtime and vignetting correction factor of 1.017 . )    of course , to get a better idea of the flare duration and flux , one needs to look at the temporal distribution of the source photons throughout the observation . in fig 2 ,",
    "we show a histogram in arrival time for the 11 photons contained within the source extraction radius .",
    "remember , we do not know which one is the background photon .",
    "the histogram is binned in 3-minute ( 180 sec ) intervals over the nearly 20-minute observation .",
    "one can see that 5 photons arrived in the first 3 minutes of the observation , 5 photons arrived during the last 8 minutes , with the remaining photon arriving in between .",
    "the data are consistent with there being only one flare which is tailing off during our observation . in this case , the flare duration is at least 20 minutes and @xmath8 cts s@xmath1 ( 5 photons in 3 minutes ) represents a lower limit to the peak count rate .    in order to get the x - ray luminosity , we adopt a conversion factor of @xmath9 ergs cm@xmath5 cnt@xmath1 .",
    "this comes from table 10 of david et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the rosat hri calibration report ( cambridge : sao ) ] , for a raymond - smith spectrum of 0.5 kev and negligible interstellar absorption .",
    "this yields an apparent energy flux , @xmath11 ergs cm@xmath5 s@xmath1 for the mean count rate . at a distance of 5.74",
    "pc , this gives us a luminosity , @xmath12 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "again , this is just a mean luminosity for the observation",
    ". the peak flare luminosity would be at least @xmath13 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "we have also analyzed the remaining 20,854 sec of our hri observation , in which no x - ray source was detected at the position of vb 10 . using the non - detection analysis software in midas / exsas ,",
    "we have calculated a @xmath14 ( i.e. 99.7% confidence ) upper limit of @xmath15 cts s@xmath1 .",
    "this translates into @xmath14 upper limits on the apparent x - ray flux and x - ray luminosity of @xmath16 ergs cm@xmath5 s@xmath1 and @xmath17 ergs s@xmath1 , respectively , for vb 10 outside of flare .",
    "these are upper limits on any quiescent emission , if it exists .",
    "all of the numbers presented in this section have been tabulated in table 1 .",
    "lclllr    flare ( mean ) & 1.14 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 flare ( peak ) & 0.18 & @xmath22 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 non - flare & 20.85 & @xmath26 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 & @xmath29",
    "this x - ray flare on vb 10 is reminiscent of the far - uv flare which was detected on vb 10 by linsky et al .",
    "these authors observed c ii , iv and si iv emission lines only during the last five minutes of an hour - long exposure taken with the ghrs onboard hst .",
    "they concluded that the flare which they had observed indicated increased magnetic heating rates for low - mass stars near the hydrogen - burning mass limit .    in both",
    "the uv and rosat x - ray observations , quiescent ( i.e. non - flare ) emission was never detected from vb 10 . for the uv flare ,",
    "the emission line fluxes were an order of magnitude greater than the upper limits placed on the non - flare emission by linsky et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . for this most recent x - ray flare ,",
    "the contrast is even greater .",
    "the peak flare luminosity is _ at least _ more than two orders of magnitude greater than the non - flare value .    for ease of comparison to more massive m dwarfs",
    ", we will normalize l@xmath30 by l@xmath31 , which for vb 10 is @xmath32 ergs s@xmath1 based on the absolute k magnitude measured by leggett ( 1992 ) and the bolometric correction of veeder ( 1974 ) .",
    "this gives us log ( l@xmath30/l@xmath33 for the peak of the flare and log ( l@xmath30/l@xmath34 outside of flare .",
    "using the data of fleming et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the late ( later than m5 ) , presumably fully - convective m dwarfs within 7 pc of the sun , we find that these star have values of log ( l@xmath30/l@xmath31 ) which are typically @xmath35 . but during flares ( e.g. az cnc ; fleming et al .",
    "1993 ) , these stars can reach values of ( l@xmath30/l@xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the magnitude of the flare on vb 10 is completely consistent with that of flares on more massive m dwarfs .    in fig .",
    "3 we display a plot of normalized x - ray luminosity versus absolute visual magnitude for all known m dwarfs within 7 pc that are later than m5 , based on data from a volume - limited survey by fleming et al .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "3 reveals the sharp contrast between the upper limit to the non - flare x - ray emission in vb 10 and the x - ray emission levels of other late dme stars . in particular , the upper limit for vb 10",
    "is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude less than that detected in the late dme stars .",
    "it is comparable to the upper limit for gj1002 in fig .",
    "3 , a quiescent dm5.5 star that does not exhibit h@xmath38 emission nor any reported flare activity . by contrast",
    ", vb 10 is a known flare star with ( variable ) h@xmath38 line emission in its spectrum . while one can not build a theory based on one observation , we can not help but speculate that our result for vb 10 does indeed reflect a decline in coronal heating efficency near the h - burning mass limit .",
    "but somehow these stars are still able to flare",
    ".    we do not understand in detail the mechanisms that give rise to energetic , transient outbursts identified as `` flares '' in the sun and late - type stars .",
    "however , flares do appear to be the result of instabilities that return stressed systems toward configurations that are characterized by lower potential energy ( rosner & vaiana 1978 ) . since we do not have an x - ray spectrum",
    ", we can not verify through modeling that the observed emission in vb 10 is consistent with the presence of loop - like magnetic structures .",
    "however , the energetics of the event suggest the possible occurrence of a large volume of flare plasma , implying the presence of large - scale magnetic structures in the atmosphere . in particular , we can crudely estimate the plausible range of spatial scales that characterize the flare event in the following manner .    in the absence of an actual energy spectrum ( such as the pulse - height spectra that were produced by the now - defunct rosat pspc ) , we assume some plausible flare plasma parameters . based on x - ray observations of other flare events on m dwarfs , we adopt a flaring temperature of @xmath39 10@xmath40 k. we note that a large flare event recorded by the rosat pspc on a late m dwarf star was well - described by a thermal plasma model fit characterized by a temperature of 2  4 @xmath41 10@xmath40 k ( sun et al .",
    "1999 ) . utilizing the xspec analysis package combined with the observed flux from the hri and the adopted temperature yields a differential emission measure at the flare maximum of em @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "the corresponding volume emission measure is @xmath44 where r@xmath45 = 0.102 r@xmath46 ( linsky et al . 1995 ) . given this estimate of volume emission measure along with electron densities in the range of @xmath47 10@xmath48 @xmath49 to 10@xmath50 @xmath49",
    ", we find characteristic linear dimensions for the flare in the range of 0.003 r@xmath45 to 0.30 r@xmath45 .",
    "thus , the flaring plasma covers a large fraction of the stellar surface if @xmath47 10@xmath48 @xmath49 , but only a small fraction if @xmath51 10@xmath50 @xmath49 .",
    "we note that the distance traveled by a sound wave in a 10@xmath40 k plasma in the 3 minute duration of the flare maximum is about 0.7 r@xmath45 .",
    "these estimates , while not conclusive , are consistent with the likely occurrence of large - scale magnetic structures associated with the flare event on vb 10 .",
    "the enormous contrast between the x - ray flare luminosity and the upper limit to quiescent emission invites further consideration , especially in view of the likely existence of significant surface magnetic flux and large magnetic structures in vb 10 .",
    "we note that if vb10 is characterized by quiescent x - ray emission at a level which is typical for the sun at the maximum in its activity cycle , i.e. , log(@xmath52 -6.3 ( following schmitt 1997 ) , then we would still not have had sufficient sensitivity to detect it .",
    "the upper limit for non - flare x - ray emission in vb 10 is more comparable to the levels of emission seen in earlier , more massive m dwarfs ( non - dme flare stars ) which are themselves characterized by x - ray emission levels that are in excess of solar , or log(@xmath53 -6 to -5 ( following fleming , schmitt & giampapa 1995 ) .",
    "we thus can not exclude the possibility that vb 10 does indeed have undetected , quiescent x - ray emission at the level of the sun or that of earlier , quiescent dwarf m stars .",
    "however , inspection of fig .",
    "3 suggests that the low level of non - flare x - ray emission in vb 10 is unusual with respect to other late - type , active dme flare stars .",
    "we will therefore briefly consider a hypothesis that may account for the extremely low , or even the possible absence of , steady , quiescent heating in this very cool dwarf .    while there is no comprehensive theory for coronal heating  even in the case of the sun",
    " a common feature of current theories is that the origin of the nonradiative heating of the corona involves the interaction between turbulent convective motions in the photosphere and the footpoints of magnetic loops ( parker 1972 , 1983a , b , 1986 ; van ballegooijen 1986 and references therein ) . in this context",
    ", our observations of vb 10 may imply that at the photosphere there is simply not enough in the way of random motions at the loop footpoints to jostle the magnetic fields and , in turn , provide sufficient dynamical stresses to lead to detectable plasma heating to coronal ( @xmath54 10@xmath55 k ) temperatures .",
    "for example , a high magnetic field strength may suppress convective motions , analogous to the situation in sunspots which are also x - ray quiet .",
    "we further note that the very cool and dense photosphere of vb 10 is dominated in content by molecular hydrogen combined with neutral metals bound in molecules . thus , there are few ions to couple the magnetic field with the photospheric gas",
    ". we estimate by extrapolation from m dwarf model photospheres ( mould 1976 ) to the effective temperature of vb 10 ( t@xmath56 = 2600 k ; linsky et al .",
    "1995 ) that the ionization fraction , @xmath57 , in the dense , upper photosphere of vb 10 is @xmath58 10@xmath59 .",
    "by contrast , @xmath58 10@xmath60 in the upper photosphere of the quiet sun ( vernazza , avrett , & loeser 1976 ) . in early m dwarfs we have",
    "that @xmath58 10@xmath61 ( following mould 1976 ) .",
    "hence , for stars in the temperature - density regime of vb 10 , the upper photospheres are characterized by ionization fractions that are 2 orders of magnitude less than that of earlier m dwarfs and 3 orders of magnitude below that of the sun .",
    "consequently , the interaction between the field and the ambient gas occurs deeper in the photosphere where the ionization fraction is higher but where sufficient energy to produce significant coronal heating is unable to propagate outward .",
    "the consequences for coronal heating of the occurrence of magnetic structures in very cool dwarfs such as vb 10 is summarized in the following argument due to f. meyer ( 1999 , private communication ; see also meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1999 ) .",
    "given that the gas pressure in the corona is typically negligible compared to the magnetic stresses , we must have that the magnetic field configuration , or `` loop '' , is force - free , or @xmath62 = 0 .",
    "thus , the electric currents must flow along the magnetic field lines . since for steady magnetic phenomena",
    "the current density is divergence - free ( @xmath63 = 0 ) , currents must also flow through the magnetic footpoints in the photosphere . in the cool and dense photosphere of stars such as vb 10 ,",
    "the electrical conductivity is so low that any current system rapidly decays . from this",
    "it follows that the magnetic equilibrium must be current - free everywhere . that is , @xmath64 = 0 so that @xmath65 = 0 , and @xmath66 .",
    "given that the potential field is a minimum energy configuration , any further build - up and storage of magnetic field energy is excluded , implying no ( or only a relatively low degree ) of magnetic field - related heating of the atmosphere .",
    "at the very least , the decay rate of energy at the footpoints must be faster than any energy input derived from the interaction between motions in the upper photosphere and the magnetic loops , effectively quenching any non - radiative heating that might otherwise have occurred .",
    "clearly , the above picture as outlined can not explain flare events .",
    "instead , the transient or flare outbursts observed in these very cool stars must arise from more complex magnetic topologies where the storage of magnetic field energy occurs , but which do not have footpoints in the cool , dense underlying photosphere .",
    "in summary , we have confirmed that the m8 dwarf vb 10 ( gl 752 b ) does indeed emit x - rays .",
    "it is the lowest mass star on the main sequence which is known to do so .",
    "this emission , however , appears to be only transient in nature .",
    "the contrast between the flare x - ray flux and any possible non - flare ( i.e. , quiescent ) x - ray emission is at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "we note that x - ray emission in vb 10 at solar levels or even at the levels seen in earlier dwarf m ( non - dme ) stars would not be detected at our sensitivity limits . in comparison to dme stars later than m5 , the upper limit to the non - flare x - ray emission in vb 10 is unusually low .",
    "we have considered a hypothesis that the low ionization fraction and , hence , low conductivity , in the photosphere of vb 10 inhibits coronal heating to the point where quiescent , @xmath2 k coronal plasma may not even exist . in this scenario ,",
    "the transient , presumably @xmath67 k coronal plasma which gives rise to the observed x - ray flare would then be associated with topologically complex magnetic field structures that do not have footpoints in the cool photosphere which is , in turn , dominated by neutral atomic and molecular species .",
    "should this scenario prove to be correct , then there may indeed be a drop in coronal activity at the bottom of the main sequence : not at the mass where stars become fully convective , as was once suggested , but at the hydrogen - burning mass limit itself .",
