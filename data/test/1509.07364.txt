    "* ) . scattering off these outflows effectively doppler shifts ly@xmath0 photons out of resonance into the red wing of the absorption line profile . in models of this process",
    "the outflow is often represented with a geometrically thin shell of gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", this so - called ` shell - model ' has been very successful at reproducing observed spectra line shapes @xcite .",
    "however , the shell - model has recently been shown to have difficulties , especially in reproducing the strength of ` blue bumps ' in a subset of observed spectra @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied what may be viewed as an extreme example of blueshifted ly@xmath0 emission in which the ly@xmath0 line of spatially extended ly@xmath0 emission around a radio galaxy as a whole is blueshifted relative to the observed 21-cm absorption , with emission extending beyond 1500 km s@xmath2 into the blue wing of the line profile .",
    "blueshifted ly@xmath0 radiation arises naturally when the photons scatter through optically thick inflowing gas @xcite . indeed ,",
    "@xcite show that their data can be reproduced if more than @xmath3 of cold inflowing gas is present .",
    "this large mass of cold neutral gas inside a massive dark matter halo ( @xmath4 ) though , is at odds with expectations from theory , which predicts that the gas should be predominantly accreted in the hot - mode ( e.g. @xcite ; fig .  7 of @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative process which gives rise to blueshifted ly@xmath0 emission is described by neufeld & mckee ( 1988 ; henceforth nm88 ) , who show that scattering across a shock front can give rise to such blueshift .",
    "nm88 presented analytical calculations , and therefore were forced to adopt simplifying assumptions , namely that the shock - crossing acceleration process is modelled by ly@xmath0photons bouncing between two partially transparent , frequency - preserving mirrors . in reality , however , the frequency of a ly@xmath0photon is not preserved at each ` reflection ' . instead , the frequency of the photon diffuses through frequency - space as the photon is scattered by the material on either side of the shock front , in turn changing the optical depth of the gas to the photon .",
    "in addition , they assume that photons cross the shock front isotropically .",
    "finally , the analysis presented by nm88 was restricted to a simplified geometry of two adjacent semi - infinite slabs .    in spite of an increasing prevalence of ly@xmath0 radiative transfer monte - carlo codes @xcite , they have so far not been used to investigate this fermi - like acceleration mechanism ( while acknowledging the inaccuracy of doing so , we henceforth refer to this as ` fermi acceleration ' for brevity ) .",
    "the goals of this paper are two - fold : ( _ i _ ) numerically study fermi acceleration of ly@xmath0 photons across a shock front without the simplifying assumptions that were required in the analytical treatment , and ( _ ii _ ) investigate whether this mechanism can help to reproduce observed blue bumps in spectra that have been difficult to explain with conventional shell - models .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows :",
    "  [ mechanism ] describes the basic acceleration mechanism ,   [ simulations ] details the simulations which we use to investigate the physical mechanism ,   [ simresults ] presents the output of our numerical experiments ,   [ applications ] discusses the applications of our findings , and in   [ conclusions ] we summarise the conclusions .",
    "ly@xmath0photons are resonantly scattered by hi , making the ly@xmath0radiative transfer complex .",
    "the propagation of ly@xmath0photons is affected by both bulk gas motion and , in detail , microscopic motion of individual hydrogen atoms .",
    "the result is that ly@xmath0photons undergo a random - walk like motion in both physical and frequency - space ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed review ) .    as ly@xmath0",
    "photons diffuse away from the resonance frequency , their mean free path - and hence their escape probability - increases . as a result ,",
    "the spectrum of ly@xmath0 photons emerging from static optically thick media consists of two peaks , which are distributed symmetrically around the resonance frequency ( as frequency diffusion can occur to lower and higher energies with equal probability k ) the energy deposited in the recoiling scattering atom becomes important , and the red peak is enhanced . ] ) .",
    "when the scattering medium is contracting [ expanding ] however , the frequency diffusion preferentially occurs towards higher [ lower ] frequencies . as a result , the spectrum of ly@xmath0 photons emerging from contracting optically thick media is blueshifted .",
    "an alternative way to see this is that the converging flow of contracting gas is doing work on the ly@xmath0 photons as they scatter outwards , which increases their mean energy @xcite .",
    "the fermi acceleration mechanism described in nm88 invokes similar converging flows of gas .",
    "the mechanism is illustrated with a simplified geometry in figure [ setupsfig ] , which shows two semi - infinite adjacent slabs of neutral gas .",
    "the slab on the left is moving to the right with velocity @xmath5 into a stationary slab . if @xmath6 exceeds the sound speed in the left slab , then the two slabs are separated by a shock front . when a ly@xmath0source is in the vicinity of this shock front",
    "we expect some ly@xmath0photons to diffuse through space and cross the front .",
    "when a photon traverses the shock front , the doppler boost will impart a blueshift in the local gas frame .",
    "partially coherent scattering off atoms with thermal velocity @xmath7 mostly preserves the blueshift of this photon : for a photon with frequency @xmath8 each scattering event pushes back the photon to the line centre by an average amount @xmath9 @xcite . when the photon scatters back across the shock front before this ` restoring force ' has returned the photon to line center , the blueshift of the photon increases with each shell crossing .",
    "this is what nm88 referred to as ` fermi acceleration ' .    in order for fermi acceleration of a ly@xmath0photon to actually occur we require it to scatter after crossing the shock front .",

    "the probability of these photons being transmitted all the way through the slab is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the optical depth of the entire static slab to photons that enter at frequency @xmath37 ( in the frame of the slab , see @xcite ; note that this transmission probability only applies when the optical depth of the slab to incoming photons is @xmath38 ) .",

    "we then get @xmath43 , which compares reasonably to the fraction @xmath44 we found in our simulation ( exact agreement is not expected as photons cross the slab over a range of frequencies ) .",
    "photons that cross the front twice are back in the low column density outflowing slab , and appear doppler shifted by an average amount @xmath45 in the slab frame ( see   3.2.2 ) .",

    "the transmission probability is thus the sum of the probability ( _ i _ ) that photons are transmitted directly through the slab ( the @xmath51 term ) , and ( _ ii _ ) that photons that do scatter eventually escape the slab without crossing the shock again . for the latter",

    "the photons that escape after two shock crossings ( green dotted line histogram ) account for @xmath84 of the total .",
    "figure  [ velshiftvsscatterings ] shows that these photons have accumulated a blueshift of @xmath85 km s@xmath2 in the frame of the outflowing gas .",
    "a doppler boost back into the lab - frame transforms these photons back to a blueshift of @xmath83 km s@xmath2 .",
    "a similar reasoning applies to photons that escape after a larger number of crossings , and shows that it is easy to understand the shape of the total spectrum : the redshifted peak ( grey crosshatched histogram ) at @xmath86 is composed of photons that did not cross the shock front .",
    "the first peak blueward ( @xmath87 ) of the ly@xmath0resonance is at @xmath88 and consists of photons that crossed the shock front @xmath89 times .",
    "similarly , the second blueward peak at @xmath90 consists of photons that crossed the shock 3 - 4 times , etc .",
    "the prevalence of these peaks depends on a number of factors , including @xmath20 , @xmath18 , @xmath91 , and also the distribution of ly@xmath0 sources relative to the hi gas .",
    "finally we note that our results here are in excellent agreement with the analytic estimate of the maximum blueshift detailed in   [ mechanism ] .",

    "is the number of shock crossings that the photon undergoes prior to exiting the simulation ( see   [ crossingstats]).,width=302 ]",
    "we now explore , by means of our monte - carlo codes and assuming some simple models , whether the fermi acceleration mechanism can provide a viable explanation for some observed systems .",
    "the analysis by nm88 was motivated by observations of 3c326.1 , a radio source with a ly@xmath0 spectral line profile with emission extending far into the blue wing of the line profile ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "nm88 modelled 3c326.1 with a shock front that was propagating into a collection of dense clumps .",
    "the shock passage triggers star formation and ly@xmath0 emission inside the post - shock gas .",
    "the subsequent radiative processes in each clump proceed just as in the slab models we discussed previously .",
    "the details of the emerging spectrum depend on the distribution and covering factor of the clumps , but for simplicity and to facilitate a direct comparison to nm88 we follow their prescription and assume that the emerging spectrum is a superposition of the spectra of individual clumps .",
    "nm88 further show that dust does not affect the emerging spectra , provided that the gas - to - dust ratio @xmath94 , where @xmath95 denotes the dust - to - gas ratio relative to the local interstellar value .",
    "they argue that this limit is acceptable because the dust grains would be destroyed by the passage of the shock front .",
    "we finally assume all clumps - and therefore the radiative transfer processes inside them - to be identical , then we can simply adopt the spectrum from figure  [ spectrumsinglesource ] . in reality , from our findings in   3.2.2 , we expect that a distribution of clump properties would give rise to a superposition of spectra with peaks in different locations , and therefore that the emission in the blue wing of the line profile would have less prominent features spectrum depends on the placement of ly@xmath0 sources . in particular , changing only the source position leaves the peak positions unchanged , but modulates their relative amplitudes .",
    "we have explicitly verified , however , that our spectrum barely changed if we assumed a uniform distribution of ly@xmath0 sources throughout the outflowing slab . ] .",
    "putting these reservations aside , we observe that qualitatively our simulated spectrum shows similarities to that predicted by nm88 .",
    "we should note though that in figure  [ spectrumsinglesource ] we omit the direct sources at @xmath96 , which nm88 put in by hand as a delta function at @xmath96 .",
    "we note that the two largest peaks immediately redward and blueward of line centre can not be attributed to photons exiting without crossing the shock front as in nm88 ( i.e. the standard double - peak profile produced by a static , optically thick medium ) .",
    "instead , our analysis shows clearly that these peaks are primarily caused by photons which have undergone 0 and \\{1 , 2 } shock crossings respectively .",
    "the smaller , secondary blueward peak is primarily composed of photons which have undergone 3 or 4 shock crossings .",
    "the primary differences between the spectra predicted by us and by nm88 are in the asymmetry of the two main peaks , and the ratio of the peaks .",
    "as we have previously mentioned , the source distribution and physical parameters of the clumps affect the outcoming spectrum , and it is likely that tuning of either or both of these will alleviate this discrepancy .",
    "the two blue peaks in our model appear to be shifted redward compared to the model predictions from nm88 .",
    "however , a comparison of the observed spectrum in nm88 and our model shows that the positions of our blue peaks are also a good fit to the data .",
    "in fact , if the amplitude of the peaks is ignored ( this is dependent on the exact source distribution ) , the position of the peaks in our model is arguably a better fit to the data than the nm88 model .",
    "we now consider the observed ly@xmath0 spectra of @xmath97 radio galaxy b2 0902 + 34 @xcite .",
    "there is broad agreement in the shape of the observed and predicted spectra , with the broad wing extending well beyond @xmath98 km s@xmath2 , and some spectra displaying prominent peaks blueshifted by @xmath98 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the spectra from b2 0902 + 34 vary widely depending on where exactly on the galaxy the fiber is placed .",
    "it is however true to say that for the majority of fibers the most prominent peak has been observed to lie either at the systemic velocity , which was determined from the observed 21-cm absorption signature , or slightly blueward of it .",
    "this would appear to be in tension with our model here which , following nm88 , predicts the most prominent peak to appear at @xmath96 ( not shown in figure [ spectrumsinglesource ] ) as a result of direct ` blister ' sources on the edge of the clump .",
    "recalling that the amplitude ratios of the peaks is determined by the source distribution , we speculate that this tension could be relieved if the most prominent peak in the b2 0902 + 34 observations is instead identified as the first blueshifted peak in our model , and the absence of a pronounced peak at systemic velocity attributed to a lower prevalence of ` blister ' sources in this system .      as we mentioned in ",
    "[ introduction ] , observed ly@xmath0 spectral line profiles can often be reproduced surprisingly well with shell - models . in these models ,",
    "a central ly@xmath0 source is surrounded by a geometrically thin shell of gas .",
    "the shell - models contain two parameters describing the ly@xmath0 source : ( _ i _ ) the assumed fwhm of the ly@xmath0 line prior to scattering , and ( _ ii _ ) the strength of the ly@xmath0 emission line , which is quantified by the equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "the shell itself is described by four additional parameters : ( _ i _ ) the hi column density of the shell @xmath99 , ( _ ii _ ) its outflow velocity @xmath100 , ( _ iii _ ) its dust content @xmath101 , and ( _ iv _ ) its velocity dispersion @xmath102 .",
    "some recent analyses have pointed out that shell - models have difficulties explaining blue bumps in observed spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nice examples can be seen e.g. in figure  7 of @xcite . more recently @xcite pointed out that the shell - models , when applied to blue - bump objects , consistently require the intrinsic ly@xmath0 line to have a fwhm which is too large ( an excessively high fwhm was only required for blue - bump objects ) .    because fermi acceleration naturally gives rise to blueshifted emission",
    ", we investigate a minor modification of the shell - model in which we embed the outflowing shell within a static gas cloud .",
    "this modification can be interpreted as the situation in which the outflow is still propagating into the static interstellar medium ( possibly prior to breaking out of it ) .",
    "this configuration now includes a shock front as in our previous analysis .",
    "we specifically study a shell - model with parameters based loosely on those inferred by @xcite : @xmath103 @xmath15 , @xmath104 km s@xmath2 , and fwhm=200 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we further assume @xmath105 , ew@xmath106 ( i.e. pure ly@xmath0emission ) , and @xmath107 km s@xmath2 ( corresponding to gas at @xmath108k ) , but note that these assumptions do not affect our results at all .",
    "these results show clearly that dust barely affects the blue bumps .",
    "this result is not surprising : our modification only adds a small amount of additional hydrogen , and this additional gas triggers fermi - acceleration into the ( blue ) wings of the ly@xmath0 line profile , where ly@xmath0photons escape more easily . ] . finally , the key new model ingredient is the addition of a static shell of gas adjacent to the outflowing shell .",
    "this shell is characterised primarily by its column density @xmath109 .",
    "we assume that it has no dust and that it has the same temperature as the outflowing shell .",
    "the results of this analysis for @xmath110 ( i.e. the original shell - model ; solid black histogram ) , @xmath111 @xmath15 ( red dashed line ) , and @xmath112 @xmath15 ( blue dotted line ) are shown in figure  [ fig : shellresults ] ,     spectra emerging from a ly@xmath0 source surrounded by a shell of hi gas outflowing at 200  km  s@xmath2 ( the shell - model , see text ) embedded within a static neutral shell with a column density @xmath109 .",

    "the plot demonstrates that adding even a small amount of hydrogen ( 1/10@xmath114 of that in the shell ) triggers the on - set of fermi acceleration , which gives rise to a blue bump.,width=302 ]    where it is clear that a small additional column of hydrogen ( @xmath115 ) dramatically affects the spectrum blueward of the systemic velocity .",
    "this large change of the spectrum can be easily understood , as the outflowing shell with @xmath103 @xmath15 directly transmits a significant fraction of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "however , the surrounding static shell is optically thick to photons emitted near line centre , because these photons still appear close to the centre of the line in the frame of this gas .",
    "the static shell therefore effectively reflects back photons into the outflowing shell we show that this mechanism produces blue bumps for column densities as low as @xmath116 @xmath15 .",

    "we have presented a detailed analysis of fermi acceleration of ly@xmath0 photons across a shock front , a process that was first studied analytically by nm88 .",
    "our monte - carlo radiative transfer simulations of the slab model ( figure [ setupsfig ] ) confirm the basic results in nm88 .    in particular , we find that each time a photon crosses a shock front that is propagating at @xmath20 , it experiences a doppler boost @xmath123 in the gas frame .",
    "the precise numerical coefficient depends on the opacity of the gas to the ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "we also find the blueshift of the ly@xmath0 photons to increase in proportion with the number of shock crossings @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath124 .",
    "we discussed how our results can help to explain extended blue wings observed in spectra of radio galaxy 3c326.1 ( which was proposed previously by nm88 ) , but we note that our line as a whole appears redshifted by @xmath125 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we reached the same conclusions for the radio galaxy b2 0902 + 34 @xcite .",
    "we nevertheless consider fermi acceleration a plausible alternative to the model proposed by @xcite , which involves the collapse of @xmath126 of neutral gas .",
    "last , we show that fermi acceleration naturally gives rise to blue bumps in ly@xmath0 spectra , which are difficult to reproduce with conventional shell - models ( at least those with reasonable values for the fwhm of the intrinsic ly@xmath0 line , see @xcite ) .",
    "we presented a natural extension to shell - models in which the shell is expanding into static gas that contains a low column density of hi .",
    "these models can give rise to blue bumps in ly@xmath0 spectra without abandoning the simplicity of the conventional shell - model transfer through more complex , simulated gas distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "note however , that the sensitivity of the ly@xmath0 transfer scattering process to the distribution and kinematics of neutral gas implies that these predictions depend on sub - grid feedback prescriptions as well as the spatial resolution of the simulation ( which ideally needs to be sub - pc , see dijkstra & kramer 2012 for a discussion ) .",
    "simulations therefore have their own uncertainties , and thus provide a complementary route to addressing ly@xmath0 scattering on interstellar scales . ] . in our model ,",
    "the bump consists of photons that initially streamed through the outflowing shell , but which were reflected back into this shell by the surrounding static interstellar medium .",
    "this suggests that blue bumps in ly@xmath0 spectra are associated with outflows that are still confined to the ism of the galaxy , which may represent an earlier stage in the evolution of the galaxy .",

    "the goal of this appendix is to clarify why the distribution of angles at which ly@xmath0 photons cross the shock front scales as @xmath68 ( where @xmath57 ) , rather than isotropically .",

    "the solid lines represent the expected values for isotropic scattering , while the dashed lines show @xmath138 .",
    "red triangular points are for odd-@xmath59 shock crossings , blue square points are for even-@xmath59 shock crossings .",
    ", width=302 ]    an explanation for this is offered in figure [ depthfromshock ] , which shows the mean distance from the shock front ( scattering depth ) of the last scattering before crossing the shock as a function of the shock crossing number @xmath59 .",
    "this distance follows an inverse exponential distribution .",
    "as the photon becomes more blueshifted with increasing @xmath59 , the mean free path of the photon also increases , so that for each successive @xmath59 the photon is coming from deeper within the slab , explaining the increasing trend in figure [ depthfromshock ] .",
    "however , as the mean free path increases , the photons which propagate the farthest actually propagate all the way through the gas slab and exit the simulation . therefore , the distribution of scattering depth is truncated for the next scattering count , resulting in a flattening in the growth of scattering depth as a function of @xmath59 .",
    "this is precisely the behaviour we observe for odd-@xmath59 in figure [ depthfromshock ]",
    ". the scattering depth distribution is truncated , but the photon blueshift is unaffected .",
    "therefore , the gas between the next scattering event and the shock front becomes effectively optically thin to the photon , and we expect photons to cross the shock front isotropically , which is why @xmath139 approaches @xmath140 in figure [ projvsscattering ] .    for even-@xmath59 we do not observe this transition to isotropic crossing .",
    "this is because @xmath141 , so that at a given @xmath59 and blueshift the mean free path of a photon is much lower in the right ( static ) slab and the scattering depth distribution for even-@xmath59 ( i.e. crossings where the previous scattering was in the right , static slab ) has not yet become truncated .",
    "as discussed above it is the truncation of the scattering depth distribution that causes the transition to isotropic shock crossing , and so in its absence for even-@xmath59 the ly@xmath0 photons still cross the shock front following @xmath68 .    .",
