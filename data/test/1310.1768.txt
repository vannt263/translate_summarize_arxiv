    "the heralded amplifier announces the time of arrival of optical signals . by doing",
    "so it increases the probability of receiving the signal after it was announced .",

    "recently , it has been shown that , if a heralded amplifier is allowed to introduce some noise , its gain and herading rate be increased  @xcite which also depends on the set of qubits to be amplified .    instead of increasing the probability of receiving the signal by announcing its expected arrival one can use an alternative strategy based on sending multiple copies of the signal through the lossy channel .",
    "this means that we will receive a message faster , because there is no reason for repeating it once it was sufficiently amplified .",

    ".  [ fig:1 ] , there are two distinct regimes in which the cloning machine can operate . the first one , described in detail in the paper , is the mirror phase - covariant regime , the other is the phase - covariat regime .",
    "the difference between these two regimes is that in the later case we have more knowledge about the hemisphere from which the amplified qubits are selected . in the extreme case of the poles",
    ", cloning can be done in a perfect way since we know everything about the copied state .",
    "this is confirmed experimentally and the results are show in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] .",
    "this figure shows that with the increase of the _ a priori _ knowledge about the states being copied we can improve the parameters of the amplifier in comparison with the universal case where the qubits to be amplified are evenly distributed over the bloch sphere .",
    "this paper presents a high - fidelity near - deterministic genuine qubit amplifier ( see figs .  [ fig:7 ] and  [ fig:8 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to heralded qubit amplifiers , our device produces pairs of photons with @xmath197 . in this sense it increases the photon rate and achieves genuine amplification . because this effect is obtained at the expense of added noise we analyzed the signal to noise ratio vs. the gain trade - off .",
    "the experimental data fit the theoretical prediction , confirming amplifier functionality . the cba does not work properly if the cloning procedure fails by sending both photons to out@xmath155 or out@xmath156 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) . in our experiment",
    "we exclude such events by coincidence detection but a full - field implementation will require other solutions ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we compare the cba working in a quantum regime ( @xmath70 ) to the stimulated emission process used for cloning .",
    "since the available nonlinearities in media are small , the efficiency of phase - covariant cloning is very low : approx .",
    "0.01 @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the cba equals 0.29 , although the theoretical limit equals @xmath198 .",
    "however , this limitation is platform dependent and in other , more advanced implementations it could reach @xmath21 .    stimulated emission based amplification strongly depends on the power of the amplified signal and is inefficient if the average number of photons in the signal is too small .",
    "in this regime the cba is potentially very useful , for the analysis of quantum channels with phase - independent damping as it extends the range of quantum communication .",
    "in particular , we have demonstarated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] ) that our implementaion of cba can yield values of @xmath56 and @xmath46 that are large enough to increase product state capacity of the transmission channel described by eq .",
