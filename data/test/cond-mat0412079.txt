    "the ground state is a product of singlets strictly localized on the oblique bonds .",
    "the real material would correspond to a ratio @xmath10 , close to the critical value where this phase disappears .",

    "early studies based on exact diagonalizations,@xcite ising expansion@xcite or dimer expansions,@xcite and real space renormalization group with effective interaction ( rsrg - ei ) @xcite predict a simple transition between the ising phase and the dimer phase for @xmath11 .",

    "the present paper employs two recently developed methods to study the phase diagram of this lattice .",
    "we first will consider the cohesive energy of the lattice , using a self consistent pertubation ( scp ) @xcite which may be seen as a modified coupled cluster expansion.@xcite the method starts from a reference function which can be the ising spin distribution or a columnar product of bond singlets .",
    "it happens that the cohesive energy calculated from the latter reference function is the lower one for @xmath1 , the lowest energy being obtained from the ising reference for @xmath15 .",
    "the calculated cohesive energies obtained by the rsrg - ei with @xmath16 sites square blocks or by the contractor renormalization ( core)@xcite with columnar blocks of @xmath17 sites agree with the values obtained from scp and support the idea of an intermediate phase .",
    "a second section concentrates on the calculation of the gap , using a renormalized excitonic method ( rem ) , based on the scale - change ideas inspiring the renormalization group methods .",
    "the methods proceeds through the definition of blocks with even number of sites .",
    "the design of the relevant blocks is different for the dimer phase and for the other phases .",
    "the calculated gap for the dimer phase is in good agreement with that of previous theoretical study @xcite and compatible with experimental evidences.@xcite approaching the problem from columnar blocks one obtains a finite gap for @xmath18 .",
    "this result confirms the existence of an intermediate phase .",
    "if one defines @xmath19 and take @xmath20 as the energy unit , the product of singlets on the oblique dimers ( @xmath6 interactions ) is an eigenfunction whatever @xmath21 , and its cohesive energy is @xmath22 .",
    "we have used the recently proposed scp method @xcite to evaluate the cohesive energy of other phases .",
    "the method can be seen as a modified coupled cluster method.@xcite it starts from a reference function @xmath23 , supposed to be a relevant zero - order function for the considered phase .",
    "this function is highly localized . in practice",

    "may also define a local triplet state .",
    "the action of @xmath24 on @xmath23 generates a first generation of local excited function @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "in the so - called intermediate normalization convention @xmath27 where the vectors @xmath28 do not interact with @xmath23 ( @xmath29 ) , the knowledge of the coefficients of the first generation @xmath25 s is sufficient to fix the ground state energy    . @xmath23 = reference function , @xmath25 = first generation function , @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 types of non factorisable second generation functions . ]",

    "[ fig2 ] ) , the vectors @xmath25 are excited singlet states produced as products of two triplets on interacting bonds .",
    "they are of four different types in a shastry - sutherland lattice , as pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the determination of the coefficients @xmath35 is governed by the corresponding eigenequation , adopting the compact notation @xmath36 , @xmath37 an estimation of the coefficients of the second generation functions @xmath28 ( such that @xmath38)is only necessary for those which are obtained from @xmath25 by operations in the strict neighborhood of the bonds involved in the process @xmath39 creating @xmath25 from @xmath23 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the spin exchanges or excitations @xmath41 on remote bonds cancel , according to the linked cluster theorem , since in that case @xmath42 the number of second generation functions to be considered is therefore very limited .",
    "their coefficient is estimated from the @xmath35 s according to perturbative arguments , with a systematic consideration of exclusion principle violating corrections of the energy denominators , which introduce infinite summations of diagrams and speed the convergence .",
    "details of the method are given elsewhere.@xcite the equations for the precise problem are given in the appendix , the results appear in fig .",
    "one sees that    * the energy calculated from ising @xmath23 is the lowest one for large values of @xmath0 .",

    "this value compares quite well with other estimates,@xcite and in particular with that of a rsrg - ei@xcite with @xmath16 sites square blocks ( @xmath43 ) * however the energy calculated from the columnar arrangement of bond singlets on the 2-d square lattice happens to be lower than the preceding one for @xmath44 .",

    "however the fact that one finds two distinct values of the energy from two distinct reference functions within an approximate algorithm does not prove the existence of two phases .",
    "it is possible that at convergence the two wave operators , @xmath48 from @xmath23 and @xmath49 from @xmath33 , lead to the same wave function @xmath50 as an argument in favor of two distinct phases we may mention that starting from an other function @xmath47 , energetically degenerate with @xmath33 ( @xmath51 ) , product of bond singlets on parallel bonds which do not belong to the same plaquette ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , the calculated energy always remains above that obtained from ising @xmath23 , as seen in fig .",
    "it is not easy , at least from our scp approach , to determine wether the intermediate phase is based on a columnar arrangement of bond singlets or is a plaquette phase .",
    "the second one keeps isotropic properties in the @xmath34 and @xmath52 directions , while the former one breaks this symmetry .",

    "after consideration of the possible excitations , the probability to find parallel spins along the two @xmath34-directed bond of an empty plaquette becomes @xmath53 of the probability to find parallel spins on the @xmath52-directed bonds of the same plaquette .",
