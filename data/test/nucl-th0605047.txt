    "the formation of mean - field is an important aspect in nuclear systems .",

    ", it is well known that clustering is another essential feature .",
    "these two different kinds of nature , cluster and shell - model - like aspects , often coexist , compete and interplay between each other .",
    "the coexistence of two aspects provides a variety of structure in nuclear systems , and can be a key to reveal properties of light nuclei .",
    "@xmath0c is one of the typical examples where the cluster and shell - model - like aspects coexist .",
    "since @xmath0c is the double sub - shell closure of the @xmath4 shell in the @xmath5-@xmath5 coupling picture , the ground state should contain such the shell - model - like nature . on the other hand , @xmath2-cluster structure",
    "is also favored in @xmath0c and is considered to develop in excited states .",
    "shell model calculations succeeded to reproduce experimental data of many levels in light nuclear region(for example , @xcite ) . however , a number of states in light nuclei have been left unsolved in those shell model studies because it is difficult for the shell models to describe well - developed cluster states in general .",
    "in fact , even the large basis shell model calculations failed to describe such the excited states as the @xmath6 state at @xmath7 mev and the @xmath8 state at @xmath9 mev near the @xmath2 threshold energy@xcite .",
    "these states have been considered to be well - developed cluster states , and their structures have been studied with @xmath2 cluster models for a long time @xcite .",
    "recently , tohsaki _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a new interpretation of the @xmath6 state as a dilute cluster gas state of weakly interacting 3 @xmath3 particles@xcite , and discussed it in the relation with the bose einstein condensed(bec ) phase in dilute nuclear matter@xcite",
    ". moreover , there are many experimental reports on the resonances in the excitaion energy region around @xmath10 mev recently @xcite .",
    "especially , the experimentally suggested @xmath11 and @xmath12 states in the broad resonances at @xmath13 mev attract an interest because these states are the candidates of the well - developed cluster states .",
    "although the structure of these resonances@xcite has been theoretically studied based on the @xmath2 cluster model approaches , their properties have not been clarified yet .",
    "the cluster model approaches are useful to describe the details of inter - cluster motion in the @xmath2 system , however , they failed to reproduce such the data as the excitation energy of the @xmath14 and the strengths of @xmath15 decays , because these properties are sensitive to such the shell - model - like features as the sub - shell closure and the @xmath3 breaking of @xmath0c but the @xmath2-cluster models is not suitable for describing the @xmath5-@xmath5 coupling features nor dissociation of the @xmath3 clusters .",
    "these facts indicate that the cluster and shell - model - like features certainly coexist in the @xmath0c system .",
    "it is expected that the shell - model - like aspects in the low - lying states may have some influence on the excited cluster states through the orthogonality and mixing with the lower states .",
    "therefore , it is important to take into account both aspects in the systematic study of @xmath0c .",
    "however , there are a few theoretical studies of @xmath0c where both the cluster and the shell - model - like features are taken into account .",
    "the method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(amd ) has been proved to be a powerful approach to describe the cluster and shell - model - like features in general nuclei .",
    "since all the single - nucleon wave functions are treated as independent gaussian wave packets in this method , the existence of clusters are not assumed in the model . instead",
    ", if the system favors a cluster structure , the cluster state automatically appears in the energy variation in this framework . for the excited states ,",
    "the method of variation after spin - parity projection(vap ) in the framework of amd is a useful approach@xcite .",

    "however , the work was limited to the low - lying states .",
    "et al . _ have done the vap calculations within the fermionic molecular dynamics(fmd)@xcite , which is similar approach to the amd .",
    "although the fmd wave function is suitable for describing both the cluster and shell - model - like structures in principle as well as the amd , the existence of 3 @xmath3-clusters were _ apriori _ assumed in the practical application to @xmath0c in@xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we studied the structure of the ground and excited states of @xmath0c with the method of the vap in the amd framework .",
    "the method is almost the same as that applied in our previous work@xcite .",
    "we calculated various quantities such as radii , transition strengths and densities , and compared them with the experimental data and other theoretical calculations .",
    "the structures of the ground and excited states were analyzed while focusing on the cluster structure and the dissociation of the @xmath3 clusters .",
    "we also estimated the partial decay widths of the resonances with the method of reduced with amplitudes .",

    "it was found that the @xmath3 breaking component is slightly contained even in the excited states with the developed @xmath2 cluster structure through the mixing of the ground state wave functions with the @xmath4-shell closure component . as a result of the mixing of the @xmath3 breaking component , the significant @xmath15 decay strengths are well reproduced by the present wave functions .",
    "moreover , it is important that the non-@xmath2 component in the ground state may change the @xmath2 cluster structure in the excited @xmath11 states through the orthogonality to the @xmath85 state .    in the analysis of the intrinsic structure and",
    "the @xmath2 clustering in the present results , it was found that the features of the @xmath2 cluster components well correspond to those of the @xmath2gcm calculations@xcite . as well as in the @xmath2gcm , we obtained the @xmath6 , @xmath72 and @xmath71 states .",
    "the @xmath6 , which corresponds to the observed @xmath11(7.65 mev ) , is dominated by [ @xmath119be@xmath120_{j=0}$ ] , and shows the trend of cluster - gas features .",
    "the predicted @xmath71 can not be directly assigned to the experimental broad @xmath11 resonance(10.3 mev ) .",
    "we expect that the corresponding @xmath11 spectra might be overlapped by the broad @xmath11(10.3 mev ) .",
    "the predicted @xmath72 state should be assigned to the recently observed @xmath12 state at @xmath138 mev@xcite . in the weak coupling picture of @xmath119be+@xmath3 , this @xmath72 can be regarded as the rotational member built on the @xmath6 state , because this state is dominated by [ @xmath119be@xmath127_{j=2}$ ] .",
    "we also proposed an alternative interpretation for the band assignment of the the @xmath72 states based on the remarkable @xmath139 and the similarity of the intrinsic structure with the @xmath71 in the present results .",
    "namely , in a collective picture , the @xmath71 and the @xmath72 states are considered to be the members of the rotational band , which is formed by the deformed intrinsic state with the linear - like @xmath2 structure .    in the present work ,",
    "the number of the base wave functions is limited and the @xmath2 configurations with the large distance are not incorporated enough .",
    "therefore , the description of the detailed resonant behavior is insufficient in the present framework .",
    "especially , for the broad resonances with @xmath2 clustering , the boundary conditions should be carefully treated in the calculation of the excitation energies and the widths .",
    "the broad @xmath11 and @xmath12 resonances have been theoretically studied with the csm and accc methods in the @xmath2 cluster models .",
    "such methods are promising in further study on these resonances .    in conclusion",
    ", we should stress that the cluster and the shell - model - like features coexist in @xmath0c .",
    "since these two kinds of nature interplay with each other , one should take into account both the features appropriately for a systematic study of @xmath0c .",
    "we expect that it is also significant for clarification of the properties of the @xmath2 resonances .",
