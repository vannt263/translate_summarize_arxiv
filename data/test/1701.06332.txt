    "make them suitable for signal filtering and non - linear frequency generation processes , while the compatibility with the silicon platform opens the possibility for scalability @xcite .",
    "delay lines , memories , modulators and frequency comb sources have been demonstrated in microresonator devices within the silicon platform @xcite . for practical applications , in order to select desired wavelengths , a spectral tunability of the resonant features",
    "is required .",
    "this is often achieved via electrical micro - heaters that exploit the thermo - optic effect to modify the refractive index of the environment , changing thus the optical path of the device @xcite .",
    "the thermo - optical tuning can be applied to a variety of materials systems , from silicon to silicon nitrides and oxynitrides , and is applicable to a wide range of operation wavelengths .",
    "this kind of approach , however , has a global action and does not allow to tune spectral channels separately . altering",
    "the transmission of a selected single resonance has been demonstrated , for example , by exploiting inverse raman scattering in si devices @xcite . as opposed to thermo - optical tuning , this effect is strongly selective to the operation frequencies , since the raman frequency and bandwidth depend primarily on the material choice .",
    "here we propose an all - optical approach to detune relatively the resonances within a microresonator by exploiting the thermo - optical effect at a local level .",
    "the effect is demonstrated by applying it to a whispering gallery resonator  waveguide system which exhibits fano interference features @xcite . the continuous detuning is used to explore complete mode crossings between two resonances . as a particular example , this fine tuning approach allows to access the complete destructive interference point on one side of the fano lineshape , where one of the resonances disappears from the spectrum , as predicted in @xcite . + the paper is structured as follows ; section [ sec : theo ] starts with a brief theoretical summary of the system under study .",
    "the generic thermo - optic effect is described in [ sec : thermoptic ] and then , in [ sec : nonlinear ] , introduced into the dynamic equations for the field amplitude in the resonator to demonstrate the tuning of a single resonance .",
    "the model is then extended to interacting modes in [ sec : twofamilies ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : expresults ] we report the experimental results , while sec .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] exposes the numerical simulations that match the model with the experiment .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] gives the summary of our results and the conclusions .",
    "the wave equation inside a circular - shaped microresonator may be separated into three one - dimensional equations with quantum numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the axial , radial and azimuthal coordinates , respectively .",
    "the resonator is considered to be single - mode in the axial direction ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the set of modes with different azimuthal number @xmath1 but with the same radial number @xmath3 is addressed as @xmath4-radial mode family , denoted with @xmath5 . here",
    ", we will consider only @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the radial direction .",
    "for each radial family , the frequency of the @xmath8 mode may be calculated as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the geometrical path of the light in the resonator , typically the circumference , @xmath11 is the effective refractive index of the mode and @xmath12 is the light velocity in vacuum .    the resonator is excited and probed by a waveguide .",
    "the transmission spectrum of the waveguide - resonator system exhibits series of negative peaks , due to the capture of the modes by the resonator , where the azimuthal modes are spaced by the free spectral range ( fsr ) @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the group velocity of the @xmath8 mode .",
    "equation  [ eq : main ] implies that , within a single radial family , modes with different @xmath1 lay at different frequencies , preventing photon exchange between such modes . when different radial families are present , however , there may be combinations of @xmath15 and @xmath1 which give spectrally overlapping modes ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fsr](a ) ) . while the spectral overlap may be an undesired feature  @xcite",
    ", it may also provide new interesting physics if an interaction among the degenerate modes is provided  @xcite .    here",
    ", we will take into account the interference phenomena due to waveguide - mediated interactions among the modes of different radial families , leading to asymmetric fano resonances and energy shifts of the modes . in order to observe the fano interference ,",
    "spectral overlap between a pair of modes belonging to different radial families is required .",
    "this means that @xmath16 , relative distance between the central frequency of two modes @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , should be at most of the same order of the largest half - width at half maximum ( hwhm ) between the two modes , @xmath19 figure [ fig : fsr](a ) shows schematically that each radial mode family is a comb of peaks obeying eq .",
    "[ eq : main ] , which are spaced spectrally by fsr according to eq .",
    "[ eq : fsr ] ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 since in general @xmath22 is different for different radial families , the fsrs will also differ .",
    "this means that the two radial mode combs will slide spectrally one against the other , similar to a vernier scale @xcite , passing though a crossing point .",
    "the relative detuning @xmath23 of two modes in the couple is thus @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the relative detuning of @xmath26-couple and @xmath27 .",
    "having couples of modes of two radial families with different relative detuning permits to monitor the coupling between the two radial families when changing the @xmath1 with a discrete step of @xmath28 just by changing @xmath1 .",
    "this has been studied in detail in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "the fano - interaction of two resonances offers a rich physics and is extremely sensitive to both the degree and the sign of the detuning @xmath29 .",
    "the asymmetric fano lineshape may vary abruptly with changing the detuning due to the fine interplay of the phases of individual resonances .",
    "for example , there exists a unique spectral point on one side of the composite resonance , where a particular destructive interference leads to a full suppression of one of the transmission features in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "this situation may be observed experimentally in very fortuitous cases for which a given @xmath28 exactly satisfies the necessary condition . on the other hand ,",
    "the particular point can be always observed if the detuning can be continuously varied within a single couple of resonances .    in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate a continuous way to detune the relative frequency of a couple of modes , allowing a complete mapping of the interaction within a single couple of resonances .",
    "moreover , this approach permits us to tune finely and capture the particular point of resonance suppression .",
    "here we propose to use the thermo - optic effect  @xcite , as a tool to tune the relative frequency of the resonator s modes . for small variations around room temperature , the thermo - optic coefficient @xmath30 may be defined as the first taylor expansion of the refractive index of the material as a function of the temperature .",
    "heating the sample thus induces a variation in the effective refractive indices and coupling coefficients of the cavity modes , that are consequently shifted . adding the thermo - optic coefficient @xmath30 into eq .",
    "[ eq : main ] we obtain : @xmath31 with this definition , the usual positive thermo - optic coefficient makes the resonances shift toward the red ( longer wavelengths ) when heating the sample .",
    "when a high - power laser ( hereafter , pump , @xmath32 ) is used to excite a doublet of resonances , a part of the energy is absorbed by the material by heating locally the resonator exactly in the spatial region where the modes extend .",
    "heat then diffuses gradually over the whole device .",
    "figure [ fig : thermolocal ] shows a finite elements method ( fem ) simulation of the temperature distribution inside the resonator when the electrical field distribution function @xmath33 of the first and second radial family modes are used as the thermal source .",
    "the respective spatial distribution functions of the electrical field of the modes @xmath34 are shown as contour lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermolocal](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : thermolocal](b ) .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in a next step , the non - linear pump equation , eq .",
    "[ eq : flt2p ] , is solved numerically to find the intensity distribution that generates the heat , in steady - state conditions , assuming the pump cold cavity spectrum parameters reported in tab .",
    "[ tab : simpar ] as constant during the evolution .",
    "the solution is obtained moving the laser from short to long wavelengths .",
    "figure  [ fig : simmap](a ) shows that a good agreement was achieved between the experimental ( black lines ) and simulated ( red dashed line ) transmission of the pump . in fig .",
    "[ fig : simmap](b ) we show the experimental evolution of the probe spectrum as a function of the pump wavelength of panel ( a ) .",
    "the experimental map is the same as is fig .",
    "[ fig : power](b ) and is reported here in order to facilitate the comparison with the simulated map .    the dynamic evolution of the relative coupling between the waveguide and the two radial family modes , that changes due to the thermo - optically altered refractive index @xmath35 , is plotted in fig .  [ fig : simmap](c ) .",
    "we note that the eqs .",
    "[ eq : flt2p ] and  [ eq : flt2s ] do not consider explicitly non - linear variations of @xmath36 , albeit the coupling among the waveguide and the resonator is affected by thermal detuning .",
    "the evolution of the relative coupling @xmath37 is therefore obtained by fitting the experimental probe spectra .",
    "the probe equation , eq .  [ eq : flt2s ] , is linear with respect to the parametric functions of pump intensities .",
    "therefore , eq .  [ eq : flt2s ] is linearly solved for each pump wavelength , producing a 2d map reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : simmap](d ) .",
    "the very good accordance between the measured and calculated maps indicates that the developed theoretical model is capturing all the details of the physical phenomenon .",
    "in this work we have reported a joint theoretical and experimental study on the possibility to tune cavity resonances via optically - driven material non - linearities .",
    "we actuated the thermo - optical effect locally around the mode extension by means of strong optical pump field , while the cavity dynamics was monitored via weak probe signal .",
    "the effect of the thermal non - linearity on the position and shape of the resonances has been exploited to tune the asymmetry of fano resonances , realizing a complete mode crossing within a single doublet of modes .",
    "moreover , we demonstrated the possibility to suppress one of these modes by fine tuning the system into a critical interaction condition .",
    "theoretically the resonator - waveguide system has been modeled via a set of non - linear equations that take into account the local heating .",
    "the developed model was validated by numerical simulations which are in excellent agreement with experimental results .",
    "further improvements to the model are expected taking into account the coupling variations induced by the thermo - optic effect also in the pump equations and possible non - linear losses .",
    "our theoretical approach can be generalized and extended to other material nonlinearities and photonic systems .",
    "for example , it may be possible to exploit ultrafast kerr nonlinearities in order to achieve high - speed modulation of the spectral response in multimode resonator devices .",
