    "it has been recognized for many years that observations of clusters of galaxies can be applied effectively to test theories of the evolution of the universe . as the largest gravitationally bound objects emerging from the growth and subsequent collapse of primordial density fluctuations ,",
    "their spatial distribution at different epochs is a relic containing evidence which can test cosmological models of structure formation .",
    "x - ray astronomy has enhanced the results of such studies greatly , for a number of reasons .",
    "first , clusters are x - ray sources of relatively high luminosity , with a luminosity function sufficiently well defined to allow , in principle at least , cosmic structure to be studied out to epochs of @xmath6 and beyond .",
    "further , ambiguities in the identification of clusters , caused by chance line - of - sight superposition of objects , are fewer in x - ray than in optical sky surveys .",
    "this is a consequence of the sharply peaked x - ray brightness distribution in most clusters , and of the relatively low surface density of bright x - ray sources .",
    "second , the x - ray properties of clusters are defined by events reaching back to the earliest epoch of cluster formation , and therefore may be used to test cosmological models .",
    "the x - ray luminosity and temperature of the intracluster gas depend on the cluster mass , so that the shape and amplitude of the luminosity and temperature functions of the cluster population are dependent on the spectrum of the early density perturbations .",
    "further , the morphology of clusters in the whole population may be dependent on the characteristics of the expansion , and is a diagnostic of cluster merging processes .",
    "finally , the abundance of heavy elements in the intracluster gas is a measure of galaxy evolution and ram - pressure stripping , and of the proportion of primordial gas in the cluster .",
    "therefore much effort has been given to the production of statistically complete samples of x - ray emitting clusters .",
    "the first were produced using @xmath7 ( schwartz 1978 ) and @xmath8 ( mchardy 1978 ) observations , and the heao-1 all - sky surveys ( piccinotti et al .",
    "1982 ; kowalski et al . 1984 ) , and contained up to 76 clusters .",
    "the flux limits of these surveys ( @xmath9 , expressed here in the rosat band @xmath1 ) , and their angular resolution were limited by the use of proportional counters , and improvements were possible only after the first missions using imaging x - ray instruments .",
    "edge et al .",
    "( 1990 ) reported the use of einstein and exosat observations to refine the results of the earlier surveys , producing a sample of 55 clusters free of , for example , the effects of source confusion . in the einstein extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss )",
    "it was possible , by examining the fields of einstein pointings covering a total of 740 @xmath10 , to create a sample with a flux limit of @xmath11 and containing clusters with redshifts out to @xmath12 ( henry et al .",
    "1992 ) .    the rosat x - ray telescope , equipped with an imaging proportional counter in the focal plane , allowed for the first time complete detailed surveys of large areas of sky ( trmper 1983 ) .",
    "the analysis of the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) proceeded in two phases rass-1 and rass-2 , described below in section 3.1 , in which the second phase incorporated a number of improvements suggested by rass-1 ( voges et al .",

    "this has its roots in an agreement between the royal observatory in edinburgh ( roe ) , the naval research laboratory ( nrl ) and the max - planck - institut fr extraterrestrische physik ( mpe ) in garching , made early in the rosat program , to make the cosmos digitised uk schmidt iiia - j survey of the southern sky ( macgillivray & stobie 1985 , yentis et al .",

    "a power - law fit to the log n - log s distribution yielded an exponent of @xmath27 .",
    "collins et al . ( 2000 ) have analysed the spatial correlation function of clusters using a reflex sample of 452 clusters covering an area 4 times larger than the sgp , and derived a value of @xmath28 mpc for the correlation length , significantly greater than the value of @xmath29 mpc obtained by romer et al .",

    "( 2000 ) find a correlation length of @xmath30 mpc , consistent with the result of romer et al .",
    "the difference between the complete reflex and the sgp results is most likely due to sample fluctuations caused by cosmic variance ( see collins et al .",
    "a significant conclusion of the reflex study is that low - density cold dark matter ( cdm ) models ( @xmath31 ) provide a better fit to the observed correlation function , and that high - density cdm models ( @xmath32 ) yield a poorer fit because they provide insufficient power at large scales .",

    "( 2000 ) .",
    "a prominent aspect of the sgp and reflex survey projects has been optical observing programs to obtain cluster redshifts , which we describe briefly in section 2 .",
    "however , it should be borne in mind that while these two projects have a common root and have followed similar procedures for cluster selection , x - ray analysis and redshift determination , they do possess some differences in approach .    following this introduction section 2",
    "provides a summary of how the sgp survey was performed .",
    "section 3 describes the various procedures by which the cluster sample was extracted from the rass-2 data base and section 4 summarises how the x - ray energy flux and luminosity were calculated .",
    "section 5 presents the sgp cluster catalog in the form of a table and describes the archive of sgp cluster images in the form of overlays of the x - ray and optical data , which is accessible at mpe over the internet .",
    "section 6 examines the completeness of the cluster sample and section 7 discusses the large - scale structure traced by the clusters out to a redshift of @xmath33 .",
    "finally a summary of the results and conclusions of the paper are presented in section 8 . throughout the article we have assumed that the hubble constant @xmath34 , the deceleration parameter @xmath35 and the cosmological constant @xmath36 .",
    "this survey selected a region at high galactic latitude in the southern sky centered on the south galactic pole .",
    "rectangular in shape , it extends in right ascension from @xmath37 to @xmath38 and in declination from @xmath39 to @xmath40 ( see figure [ f18 ] ) , giving it an area of 1.013 steradian .",
    "the search for clusters in this region invoked no flux threshold , but intead worked to the limit of the rass data to maximise the completeness of the sample of cluster candidates .",
    "a flux limit is established subsequently to define a complete subsample .",
    "the first step in the search for clusters was to select all x - ray sources found in the region by the rass-2 analysis ( voges et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this analysis",
    "the threshold values for the source detection algorithmns were lowered ( section 3.1 ) , with the aim of achieving as deep a survey as the rass would allow .",
    "therefore cluster searches using this data base have more sensitivity than has been available to previous southern hemisphere searches using the rass-1 data base ( romer 1995 , de grandi et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the rass-2 analysis was not equipped for detailed examination of the x - ray properties of extended sources such as clusters . to this end a number of techniques have been developed , including voronoi tesselation and percolation ( vtp , ebeling & wiedemann 1993 ) , the steepness ratio technique ( srt , degrandi et al .",
    "1997 ) and the growth curve analysis ( gca , bhringer et al .",
    "the goal of these techniques is to obtain reliable fluxes for both extended and point sources , and to extract from the raw data as much information as possible about the x - ray source characteristics . in this study the gca technique has been used to analyse the list of candidates obtained from the rass-2 data base .",
    "cluster candidates were selected from this sample using the cosmos digitised iiia - j survey and a search procedure called csearch .",
    "this procedure , which is not designed to select clusters in an unambiguous manner , compares the galaxy density around the rass-2 position with the background galaxy density on the uk schmidt plate , and derives a probability that the result was a random coincidence .",
    "a sample of cluster candidates is obtained by setting a threshold to this probability , and this threshold is set low enough to ensure that few genuine clusters are lost and a high completeness is attained in the final sample . in our study a rass-2 list of 11981 sources is reduced by csearch to 3236 candidates ( section 3.3 ) . at this point much remains to be done to remove contaminating sources , which we estimate from internal statistical tests to comprise about half the candidates , in an objective process . at high redshifts ( @xmath41 )",
    "the method reaches a limit of the cosmos data , when many cluster galaxies become so faint as to be classified by cosmos only as faint objects , which are not counteed by csearch .",
    "therefore some clusters at high redshift may be missed , which may be one source of incompleteness near the flux limit of the survey .",
    "the analysis of this sample of cluster candidates began by setting a limit of @xmath42 to the x - ray count rate in the hard band ( @xmath43 , section 3.1 , 3.4 ) , which reduced the number of candidates from 3236 to 477 .",
    "this was followed by the process of removing contaminating sources from this sub - sample , which proceeded through a number of stages .",
    "the first was the removal of cosmos artifacts , bright sources which to the eye were clearly not clusters , and redundant detections by rass-2 of the same source , particularly in extended sources such as clusters .",
    "this was done by examination of cosmos optical finding charts and of overlays of the optical and x - ray images .",
    "the second was to correlate rass-2 positions with the simbad catalog , in order to eliminate bright stars found in the rass-2 error circle , and then to use two x - ray properties of the source , hardness ratio and extent , as selection criteria .",
    "the hardness ratio was used to exclude those stars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) whose spectra are sufficiently soft to exclude the possibility that the source is a cluster .",
    "the x - ray extent was used to classify candidates in three groups , namely clusters , agn candidates and a remainder of uncertain nature . the third and final stage , identifying the clusters and known agn among the remaining sample , proceeded along two parallel paths .",
    "the first comprised correlations of the candidate list with a variety of catalogs , in particular the nasa extragalactic data base ( ned ) , the simbad catalog , and the veron catalog of agn ( veron - cetty & veron 1998 ) .",
    "the second was an ongoing examination of the results of the supporting optical observations , described below , which identified agn in the sample .",
    "we summarise here briefly the sources of incompleteness in the final catalog obtained , which reduce the cluster count at low fluxes : + i ) the csearch analysis has a predetermined level of incompleteness in correlating + x - ray sources with galaxy concentrations ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "+ ii ) the sharp count - rate limit ( @xmath42 ) rejects some sources at low energy + flux , due to the variation of interstellar column density in the field ( section 3.4 ) .",
    "+ iii ) some distant clusters elude the tests applied in searching the list of candidates + yielded by csearch and the x - ray count - rate cut ( section 3.5 ) .",
    "+ finally , a vital complementary part of the sgp survey and the reflex project has been a program of optical observations to obtain the redshifts of those clusters detected in the rosat survey , for which no redshifts were available in the literature . the sgp survey , which commenced not long after the launch of rosat in 1990 , was supported by three campaigns at the 4 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) and three at the 1.9 m telescope of the south african astronomical observatory .",
    "the results of these campaigns have been reported by romer ( 1995 ) .",
    "a larger program , which started in 1992 and was completed in 1995 , was installed as a key project at the european southern observatory ( eso ) .",
    "its purpose was to obtain redshifts for clusters in the reflex sample .",
    "an ongoing continuation of these observations is being pursued to support the extension of the reflex survey to lower x - ray flux limits .",
    "the rosat observatory was launched on 1990 june 1 , and saw first light on 1990 june 16 ( trmper et al . 1991 ) .",
    "after a two - month verification of the instrument operation it commenced its six - month long survey of the whole sky on 30 july 1990 . during the rass the observatory rotated about an axis through the sun , scanning on a given day a @xmath44 wide strip passing through the ecliptic poles",
    "the survey ended on 1991 february 18 .",
    "the first analysis of the survey ( rass-1 ) , which took place in 1991 - 1993 , used data collected into the same @xmath45 wide strips , and yielded a list of some 50,000 sources containing positions and such characteristics as count - rate , hardness ratio , angular extent and source detection likelihood .",
    "rass-1 was used to test the algorithms implemented in the analysis and to start scientific studies , and as a consequence a series of improvements was initiated ( voges et al .",
    "1999 ) : + i ) sorting the data into 1378 sky fields of size @xmath46 , overlapping at least @xmath47 .",
    "+ this improved the efficiency of source detection .",
    "+ ii ) for operational reasons the rass-1 data base contained a few regions of low + exposure , which were filled in later by supplementary observations .",
    "this + later data was included in the rass-2 data base .",
    "+ iii ) searching for sources in the soft @xmath48 , hard @xmath49 and broad + @xmath50 energy bands independently .",
    "+ iv ) refining the pointing attitude solution and improving source positions .",
    "+ v ) improvement of the spline - fit to the background , yielding more accurate source + count - rates .",
    "+ vi ) the list of candidates selected by the sliding - window source detection algorithmns + was increased by lowering the detection threshold , and in the subsequent maximum + likelihood analysis the likelihood threshold for accepting sources was lowered + from 10 ( rass-1 analysis ) to 7 . + reanalysis of the survey data using the new software ( rass-2 ) was performed in 1994 - 1995 , yielding a list of 145060 sources .",
    "the sgp field contained 11981 sources above a likelihood threshold of 7 .",
    "the characteristics of the new software and results from the rass-2 analysis have been described by voges et al .",
    "the results described here relied solely on the rass-2 data base ( rass bright source catalog in voges et al .",
    "1999 and rass faint source catalog in voges et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath45 wide rass scan strips overlap to an extent which increases with ecliptic latitude , and consequently the exposure time grows and reaches a maximum at the poles .",
    "this effect is visible in the map of the rass exposure time in the sgp survey region ( figure [ f1 ] ) , in which there is a systematic increase from the nw to the se corner . upon this change",
    "are superposed striations caused by periodic protective shutdown of the focal - plane detector as it traversed radiation belts .",
    "analysis of the exposure map of the sgp survey region yields the histogram shown in figure [ f2 ] , in which the mean exposure time is 300 seconds .",
    "there is an area of @xmath51 in the sgp field , in which the exposure time is less than @xmath52 .",
    "the roe cosmos digital data base contains the results of scanning 894 plates of the uk schmidt iiia - j ( blue ) southern hemisphere survey .",
    "the sgp study area contains 161 fields , each of size @xmath53 .",
    "cosmos analyses and classifies each object in a field , and records the @xmath54 magnitude , position ( r.a . and declination ( 2000 ) ) and object shape parameters .",
    "objects are classified primarily as stars , galaxies or faint objects , the last being objects whose low intensity on the plate defies a reliable determination of their class .",
    "heydon - dumbleton , collins , & macgillivray ( 1989 ) compared the cosmos galaxy number count - magnitude distribution with those derived from several independent optical surveys , and deduced that the galaxy sample was essentially complete ( @xmath55 percent completeness level ) to a magnitude limit @xmath56 . beyond this limit",
    "the star - galaxy discrimination gradually becomes less reliable as @xmath54 increases ( macgillivray & stobie 1985 , heydon - dumbleton et al .",
    "1989 ) , leading to a significant incompleteness of the galaxy sample in the range @xmath57 . in the cosmos data",
    "base star / galaxy separation was performed down to a limit of @xmath58 .",
    "an example of the results is given in a figure , which shows the @xmath59 galaxies identified by cosmos in the sgp field ukj 411 ( this figure is in the published article , but was too large for this archived version ) .",
    "the galaxy magnitudes have been calibrated using photometric ccd observations of sequences of galaxies , which were used also in the calibration of the edinburgh / durham galaxy catalog ( heydon - dumbleton et al .",
    "1989 ) . for any given plate cosmos",
    "yields a galaxy intensity , which depends on such factors as exposure time , emulsion characteristics and measures taken to keep the plate in a dry environment during exposure .",
    "this implies that the galaxy magnitudes for any given plate must be adjusted to match the surrounding plates .",
    "this is done by identifying galaxies in the overlapping border zone of adjacent plates , and deriving a shift which matches the galaxy magnitudes .",
    "no unique solution for the whole southern sky is possible , and instead a set of plate magnitude shifts is obtained by a fitting procedure which globally minimises the inconsistencies between adjacent plates .",
    "the resulting cosmos galaxy magnitudes are on an arbitrary machine scale , which now must be adjusted to match the ccd calibrations , in essence providing a global zero point solution to the matched plate data .",
    "this is done by fitting a correlation between the ccd and cosmos magnitudes of galaxies in the ccd observation sequences .",
    "to further ensure there were no calibration problems as a result of the iosophotal thresholding of the cosmos galaxies ( isophotal thresholding results in loss of light below the isophote level used and hence underestimation of the true brightness of a galaxy ) , we accepted for calibration purposes only galaxies in the cosmos data which were at least three magnitudes above the plate limit ( i.e. @xmath60 ) .",
    "this resulted in 207 sequence galaxies being accepted for calibration .",
    "the rms scatter of the correlation between the cosmos and the ccd magnitudes for these galaxies was found to be @xmath61 . as the intrinsic error in the ccd photometry",
    "is estimated to be @xmath62 , we estimate that the resulting error in the magnitudes derived for galaxies in the cosmos iiia - j southern hemisphere survey is @xmath63 .",
    "some independent corroboration of the cosmos galaxy photometry is provided by the study of caretta , maia , & willmer ( 2000 ) .",
    "they confirm after comparisons with their ccd data that the cosmos galaxy magnitudes are reliable at the @xmath63 level .",
    "their results indicate that galaxy samples are @xmath64 percent complete at magnitudes down to @xmath65 , in broad agreement with the cosmos estimates .",
    "however this agreement should be treated with caution , as caretta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) studied a small area of sky having a lower galaxy count than is available in the uk schmidt southern hemisphere survey .",
    "the cluster search procedure ( csearch ) counts galaxies within 5 circles of radius @xmath66 = 1.5 , 3 , 5 , 7.5 and 10 arcmin ( circles 1 through 5 ) , centered at the rosat source position , and compares the results with those of random sampling in the ukj field .",
    "these radii correspond to the range of expected cluster core diameters ( e.g. at @xmath67 a radius of 300 kpc is equivalent to an angular scale of 1.1 arcmin and at @xmath68 to 11 arcmin ) .",
    "the random sampling was performed 1000 times for each radius , yielding for each field five histograms of the galaxy count . for each histogram",
    "a table is created , giving the probability @xmath69 that the galaxy count exceeds a value , @xmath70 : + @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number of cases where the galaxy count was @xmath73 .",
    "selection of cluster candidates is made after setting a threshold @xmath74 , which implies that for each plate a threshold be set for @xmath70 . individual plate sensitivity and",
    "statistics make this galaxy count threshold vary from plate to plate and yield a significant uncertainty .",
    "the following argument describes how this is circumvented by analysing the ensemble of probability values @xmath69 for the whole sgp rass-2 source sample .",
    "the rosat source is accepted if the probability associated with one of the 5 galaxy counts ( circles 1 through 5 ) at the rosat position falls below a selected threshold @xmath75 . for convenience ,",
    "we have defined and used the quantity @xmath76 , as this approaches a maximum value of 1 for cluster candidates .",
    "the range @xmath77 is divided into bins of equal width ( typically 400 in number ) , and for any given search radius @xmath66 we create a histogram of the source count ( @xmath78 ) per bin for all the rass-2 sources in the sgp field . if there were no correlation between the rosat position and the galaxy count , as would be close to the truth for an ensemble of stars and agn , the expectation value for the number of sources , @xmath78 , per bin would be independent of @xmath79 ( bhringer et al .",
    "figure [ f4 ] shows the histograms of the probability p obtained for the rosat sources detected in the sgp region . to save space",
    "we show results for @xmath66 = 1.5 , 3 , 5 and 10 arcmin only .",
    "the major characteristic of these histograms is indeed a flat distribution with statistical fluctuations , but in addition there is an enhancement at values of @xmath79 approaching @xmath80 , which is the signature of clusters .",
    "a comment on the data used to create these histograms is necessary .",
    "following the first csearch analysis of the sgp sources in the rass-2 data base , examination of images overlaying the x - ray and the optical fields revealed multiple detections by rass-2 of the more nearby clusters , due to their markedly extended x - ray emission ( e.g. a119 ) .",
    "this biases the csearch analysis , and therefore we removed 256 redundant multiple detections from the rass-2 sgp source list , and then repeated the analysis .",
    "this number is small compared to the total of 11981 sources , but is more significant in relation to the size of the eventual csearch sample of cluster candidates ( 3236 ) .",
    "the threshold @xmath81 must be chosen carefully in terms of the desired compromise between formal completeness @xmath82 and contamination @xmath83 , for inevitably the selected sample contains rosat sources having chance associations with concentrations of galaxies , which build the flat distribution , and so the price of higher completeness is an increased contamination .",
    "the probability threshold @xmath81 is related to @xmath82 and @xmath83 by the following equations : + @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the number of sources per bin in a specified flat portion of the probability histogram .",
    "before the results of csearch are discussed , two characteristics of the histograms shown in figure [ f4 ] should be clarified .",
    "first , the dip in @xmath79 for circle 1 in the range @xmath87 is a quantisation effect , due to the galaxy count jumping from 0 to 1 .",
    "the dip for circle 5 in the same region appears to be due to sampling limits , resulting from the circle diameter being a significant fraction of the field width .",
    "we have examined the number density of clusters found in our analyses as a function of position on the plate , and have found no sign of incompleteness near the cosmos digitisation boundaries on the plate .",
    "second , whereas the histograms for circles 1 and 2 decay rapidly from the peak at @xmath88 to a flat plateau , those for circles 3 and 5 decay even more rapidly to a minimum and then rise to a second enhancement in @xmath89 , covering the range @xmath90 for circle 3 and @xmath91 for circle 5 . to search for the cause of this second enhancement we examined how candidates found using circles 1 and 2",
    "were registered using circles 3 through 5 .",
    "a typical result ( figure [ f5 ] ) shows how compact groupings of galaxies found by circle 2 , for which @xmath92 , are detected using circle 5 .",
    "the number of sources falls sharply from @xmath93 to a minimum , rises to a peak at @xmath94 and then falls again gradually , i.e. much of this second enhancement is due to relatively compact groups , for which the number of galaxies counted is not significantly enhanced when detected with circles 3 and 5 . as a consequence",
    "the effect of increasing the circle radius is to reduce @xmath79 .    the five candidate lists ( @xmath66 = 1.5 , 3 , 5 , 7.5 and 10 arcmin ) are cross - correlated to remove redundant detections , and so this second enhancement is in principle not a problem .",
    "however , if for each circle @xmath81 is set so as to yield a high value of @xmath95 ( equation 2 ) , then for circles 3 through 5 the contamination @xmath83 is increased substantially , making the subsequent screening of the sample more difficult and time - consuming .",
    "therefore as a precaution , for circles * 4 and 5 only * we have set @xmath81 at @xmath96 , so as to include only the sharp peak .",
    "we show below that this is a reliable procedure .",
    "the sgp field contains 11981 rass-2 sources having a likelihood greater than or equal to @xmath97 .",
    "table 1 shows the results of analysing this sample with csearch , and summarises the assumptions made in selecting cluster candidates .",
    "the last entry @xmath98 gives the yield of new candidates as one starts with circle 1 , and then proceeds from circles 2 to 5 , * removing redundant detections * at each stage .",
    "the trends in these numbers confirm the expectation that the smaller circles should detect the majority of clusters .",

    "( 2000 ) , has been used in this study to analyse the rass-2 data base .",
    "the gca returns among other information the following important parameters : background subtracted source count - rate and its poisson ( photon statistical ) error , a locally redetermined position of the centroid of the source x - ray emission , the mean exposure for the source region , a significance of the source detection , the radius out to which source emission is significantly detected , a hardness ratio characterizing the source spectrum and its photon statistical error , a fitted source core radius , and the probability , obtained using a kolmogorov - smirnov test , that the object is consistent with being a point source .",
    "the source position is determined with an error which in most cases is less than @xmath103 , the exceptions being nearby clusters with irregular emission structure .",
    "errors in count - rate and hardness ratio are given in our catalog ( table 3 ) .",
    "taking a2726 as an example , the hard band count - rate is @xmath104 and the hardness ratio is @xmath105 .",
    "the basic parameters are derived from the photon distribution using the three energy bands ` hard ' ( 0.5 to 2.0 kev , channel 52 - 201 ) , ` broad ' ( 0.1 to 2.4 kev , channel 11 - 240 ) , and ` soft ' ( 0.1 to 0.4 kev , channel 11 - 40 ) .",
    "the band definitions are the same as those used in the standard analysis ( voges et al .",
    "most of the derived parameters are based on analyses of data in the hard energy band , as clusters are detected in this energy band with the highest signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "one of the exceptions is the hardness ratio , which requires also the results from the soft band .",
    "the gca method uses the photon event distributions in two circles ( figure [ f6 ] ) , of radii 20 and 41.3 arcmin , centered initially on the rass-2 source center .",
    "events within the inner circle are analysed to determine the source characteristics , and those in the outer annulus are used to determine the background level . in some cases special analyses were necessary , where either clusters had an unusually large angular extent , or where two or more sources lay in a confused region , requiring the use of deblending algorithms .",
    "the source count - rate is determined from the cumulative , radial source count rate profile ( growth curve ) after background subtraction .",
    "the construction of the growth curve is preceded by a redetermination of the source center and by the background measurement .",
    "a typical example for the resulting growth curve is displayed in figure [ f7 ] , showing the count - rate plotted as a function of integration radius ( solid curve ) .",
    "the dashed lines show the limits determined by applying the photon event statistical error ( including the error for the background subtraction ) .",
    "the count - rate is determined in two alternative ways . in the first a significant outer radius of the source",
    "is defined as the point where the increase in the @xmath106 error is larger than the increase of the source signal .",
    "the integrated count - rate is calculated using events within this cutoff radius . in the second method a horizontal level is fitted to the outer region of the plateau , and this value is adopted as the standard in quoting hard - band x - ray count - rates and in calculating cluster energy flux and luminosity ( section 4 ) .",
    "however , we use the first method also as a check on the count - rate and as a means of estimating systematic uncertainties in the count - rate determination , which must be combined with the pure photon statistical errors .    careful examination of the overlays of x - ray and optical images ( section 3.5.1 ) of the cluster sample revealed 19 cases in which the source was very extended , or source confusion might cause errors in deriving the source count - rate .",
    "these 19 were subjected to the special analyses referred to above , in which the source count - rates were revised .",
    "six systems were identified as double clusters and not subjected to the deblending analysis .",
    "they are identified as double clusters in the survey catalog ( table 3 ) .",
    "the other two important source properties determined by the gca method are the spectral hardness ratio and the source extent .",
    "the hardness ratio , @xmath107 , is defined as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the hard band and @xmath110 the soft band source count - rate ( both determined for the same outer radius limit ) .",
    "the source extent is investigated in two ways . in the first a @xmath111-model profile ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 )",
    "convolved with the averaged survey psf is fitted to the differential count - rate profile ( using a fixed value of @xmath112 ) , and we derive from the results a core radius , @xmath113 . in the second a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test is used to estimate the probability that the object is a point source .",
    "it is taken as highly likely that the source is extended when the ks probability is less than 0.01 .",
    "tests with x - ray sources which have been identified with stars and agn showed that a false classification as an extended source occurred in less than 5% of the sample .",
    "the final step in the x - ray analysis was to establish a lower limit to the source count - rate , in order to set practical limits to source identification and redshift determination .",
    "the list of 3236 candidates from the csearch analysis ( section 3.3 ) was truncated using a threshold of @xmath42 for the cut - off radius count - rate in the hard band .",
    "this reduced the list of candidates to 477 .",
    "a sharp limit in count - rate corresponds to a range of energy flux , determined by the variation of interstellar column density @xmath114 in the field , which leads to some incompleteness at low fluxes .",
    "bhringer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimate a range of @xmath115 in the band @xmath1 for @xmath116 . in the sgp field",
    "@xmath117 takes on relatively low values so that , for example , for only 8 percent of the clusters selected is @xmath118 .",
    "therefore we can be certain that this source of incompleteness is absent at fluxes greater than @xmath119 .",
    "the removal of contaminating sources from the list of 477 candidates was by necessity an iterative process , in which the decisions made were reviewed repeatedly to ensure that the criteria used had been applied consistently .",
    "the following sections describe the steps in this process .      for each cluster candidate a finding chart @xmath120 in size was extracted from the cosmos data base .",
    "in addition an overlay was made of the x - ray surface brightness contours upon the cosmos optical field .",
    "for example figure [ f8 ] shows the overlay made for the abell cluster a3854 .",
    "examination of these finding charts and overlays during the selection process has been valuable for several reasons .",
    "first , visual scrutiny has removed cases in which csearch had been deceived by artifacts , for example satellite trails , the haloes and diffraction spikes of bright stars , and the attempt by cosmos to resolve the structure of bright nearby galaxies .",
    "these structures often were resolved by cosmos into objects identified as galaxies .",
    "second , the rass-2 analysis resulted in multiple detections of extended sources such as clusters , which may be removed after examination of the x - ray / optical overlays .",
    "as described in section 3.3 , a significant number of redundant detections was removed to minimise any bias of the csearch analysis .",
    "however this process was not perfect , and it was possible later to identify further cases by careful re - examination of the overlays .",
    "the latter are counted in the detection statistics shown later in table 2 .",
    "finally , scrutiny of the finding charts and overlays has identified occasional errors , which are simple to correct , where a csearch candidate is identified with a faint rass-2 x - ray source having a brighter x - ray neighbour .",
    "the gca technique then has preferred the latter and derived the higher count - rate .",
    "this problem was detected through visual examination of the overlays .",
    "the temperature and extent of the hot gas in clusters of galaxies make it possible to set limits to both the x - ray hardness ratio and the angular extent of a rass cluster source ( ebeling et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "this provides effective discriminants between clusters and the majority of contaminating sources in the csearch sample , made up of agn and stars . in this section",
    "we justify the following two criteria , which have been used in removing a large fraction of these contaminating sources : + 1 ) the * upper limit * of the x - ray hardness ratio ( section 3.4 ) is less than zero , + i.e. if @xmath121 , the source is too soft .",
    "+ 2 ) the core radius @xmath113 obtained from the angular extent calculation is less than + @xmath122 , i.e. the object is a point source .",
    "+ these criteria were applied independently in rejecting sources . in order to establish criteria using these parameters",
    ", we selected control samples describing the characteristics of clusters , agn and stars .",
    "the first contained @xmath123 abell clusters extracted from the total sample of @xmath124 candidates ( section 3.4 ) , using as a criterion a correlation between the x - ray position and the centroid of an abell cluster .",
    "conservatively we excluded from the sample clusters where the separation between the rosat and abell positions was greater than @xmath125 , where the survey exposure was low @xmath126 , or where x - ray maps revealed nearby components in the source region , one of which might not be a cluster . in each case the x - ray / optical overlay image ( section 3.5.1 ) and the cosmos finding chart were examined .",
    "the count - rates of these clusters covered the full range of the study reported here .",
    "the second and third control samples comprised agn and stars detected by the rosat survey and identified through spectroscopic optical observations .",
    "this project was a collaboration between mpe and eso , in which the error circles of all rass-1 sources in four relatively small regions of the southern hemisphere were searched using the cosmos data base to identify optical candidates .",
    "the nature of these candidates was examined through spectroscopic observations , after which the likely source of the x - ray emission was identified ( t. a. fleming 1994 , private communication ) . using three of these fields having a total area of @xmath127 , we selected samples of @xmath128 agn and @xmath129 stars , whose positions are within 20 arcsec of the rass-2 source positions . again , the x - ray count - rate of these sources covered the full range of the cluster survey reported here .",
    "the hardness ratio ( @xmath130 ) distributions for these samples are shown in figure [ f9 ] . whereas @xmath131 for @xmath132 percent of the abell clusters in our test sample , @xmath133 for @xmath134 and @xmath135 percent of the agn and star samples respectively .",
    "therefore a conservative threshold of zero for the * upper limit * to @xmath130 has been set , above which rass sources qualify for retention in the list of cluster candidates .",
    "this is an effective method of removing a large fraction of the stars and agn in our sample of 477 candidates .",
    "the angular extent , as measured by the derived core radius @xmath113 , provides an effective test for distinguishing clusters from agn , which however runs into two difficulties .",
    "the first is caused by the diminishing size of clusters with increasing redshift , an effect which is emphasised if the cluster contains a cooling flow .",
    "the second is the effect of source confusion in a rass-2 detection of an agn , when the gca analysis may yield a finite value for the source extent .",
    "these difficulties are constrained to a certain extent by the redshift limit ( @xmath67 ) and by the limit set to the x - ray count - rate in the hard band ( section 3.4 ) .",
    "the distributions of @xmath113 derived from the two samples are shown in figure [ f10 ] .",
    "the rise in these curves at a radius of @xmath136 is a result of setting a limit @xmath137 in the gca , and to a lesser extent of the influence of surrounding sources on the growth curve analysis ( section 3.4 ) .",
    "the important characteristic is that 58 percent of agns satisfy @xmath138 , whereas @xmath132 percent of abell clusters in our test sample satisfy the condition @xmath139 .",
    "therefore only those sources among the 477 csearch cluster candidates were retained which satisfied the condition @xmath139 . as discussed in section 3.5.5 ,",
    "this results in some incompleteness near the survey limit , where the rass and cosmos data become marginal in the detection of distant clusters .",
    "we have examined four clusters in the abell control sample , which were rejected when these hardness ratio and core radius criteria were used .",
    "one , associated with a2800 , failed the hardness ratio test .",
    "this may be due to contamination , as it is in a confused region of x - ray emission .",
    "three sources , associated with a3866 , s181 and s1121 , failed the core radius test . in the case of s181",
    "the galaxies are faint and displaced from the center of the x - ray source , which is comparatively strong ( @xmath140 in the hard band ) .",
    "the small rass-2 error circle contains a stellar object ( @xmath141 ) , and therefore we conclude that this source is an agn ( the emission from agn comes from a concentrated region , so that often cosmos classifies the object as a star ) .",
    "the source coincident with a3866 has a high count - rate ( @xmath142 ) yet shows only weak signs of extent . although the spectroscopic observations ( romer 1995 ) revealed evidence of an agn , overlaying an einstein hri image upon an optical dss image indicates that the central object is probably a cd galaxy and that the x - ray source is very compact but not a point source .",
    "thus the decision to reject this source is open to correction .",
    "s1121 appears to be an example of a distant cluster near the limit of the survey sensitivity .",
    "thus four clusters in the test sample of 118 abell clusters were rejected , from which we estimate that in applying the hardness ratio and core radius criteria to our cluster sample , the loss of clusters should be less than 4 percent .",
    "bright stars appear in the sample of cluster candidates either because of a chance association with a region of high galaxy density , or because cosmos has broken down the diffraction spikes and/or halo into objects classified as galaxies .",
    "they have been removed using two tests , one being the hardness ratio test described in section 3.5.2 and one being a statistical test . in the latter we have analysed @xmath143 regions of diameter @xmath144 in the sgp field , using the cosmos data to derive the mean density of stars as a function of @xmath54 magnitude .",
    "the following argument was used to reject rass-2 sources having stars brighter than @xmath145 in the error circle .",
    "the density of stars brighter than @xmath145 was found to be @xmath146 , which implies that the probability of finding such a star by chance in a rass-2 90-percent confidence error circle , which typically has a radius of about @xmath147 , is @xmath148",
    ". therefore if we reject all candidates having a star brighter than @xmath145 within the error circle , the loss of clusters from the sample should be no more than @xmath149 .",
    "this procedure has been applied by correlating the candidate list with stars in the simbad and tycho ( hg et al .",
    "1998 ) catalogs .",
    "a correlation of the @xmath150 magnitudes in these catalogs with the cosmos @xmath54 magnitudes shows that the latter are lower by about 0.5 magnitudes for stars fainter than @xmath151 , but that the difference widens steadily for brighter stars .",
    "therefore in examining bright simbad or tycho catalog stars in the rass-2 error circle we set a threshold of @xmath152 , below which the star was judged to be the cause of the x - ray emission .",
    "additional stars , not listed in the simbad and tycho catalogs , were identified later by inspection of the cosmos finding charts and the x - ray / optical overlay images for the 477 candidates .",
    "the x - ray sources removed by the hardness ratio @xmath153 and core radius @xmath154 tests have been reviewed carefully , using correlations of the list of 477 candidates with the veron catalog of active galaxies ( veron - cetty & veron 1998 ) and the nasa extragalactic data base ( ned ) to identify sources for which the 90 percent rass-2 error circle contained an identified agn , and examination of the x - ray / optical overlay images and the cosmos finding charts .",
    "however in the sample remaining after these tests , after removal of stars ( section 3.5.3 ) and after identification of detections resulting from cosmos artifacts , there remained a contaminant comprising 28 sources for which @xmath155 or @xmath139 , but whose identification as a cluster was suspect .",
    "these sources were reviewed using again the veron and ned correlations , overlay images and cosmos finding charts , but in addition using the results of the csearch analysis .",
    "of these 28 we rejected 9 as being agn and 1 as an x - ray source superposed on a nearby galaxy over 5 arcmin in extent .",
    "nine sources were excluded because the extent detection was due to source confusion , and 8 because csearch either made an identification at a large radius only , inconsistent with the small x - ray extent , or made an error due to cosmos artifacts .",
    "the one remaining source requires further study and was rejected tentatively .",
    "there is a possible association with a2813 , but the minimum found by gca in the core radius fit was very shallow and the evidence for a cluster in the x - ray / overlay image was indecisive .",
    "the total number of agn identified was 127 , and figure [ f11 ] shows the distribution of their @xmath54 magnitudes , as measured by cosmos .",
    "where the agn was not identified in the veron catalog or ned , @xmath54 for the brightest object inside the 90 percent error circle was used .",
    "the half - width of the distribution lies in the range @xmath156 .",
    "finally , we discovered five candidates showing large extended regions of x - ray emission @xmath157 in diameter , whose optical fields show no signs of a significant galaxy population and whose origin as the confusion of several sources is not obvious .",
    "after removal of rass-2 sources contaminating the sgp sample of 477 cluster candidates , using the procedures described above , there remained 186 candidates .",
    "the statistics of this selection process are summarised in table 2 . of the 61 redundant rass-2 detections in table 2 which eluded the earlier screening ,",
    "24 were associated with clusters .",
    "therefore of the 477 candidate sources @xmath158 are associated with clusters , which implies that the contamination of the sample of 477 was 0.56 .",
    "this is in marginal agreement with the results of the csearch analysis ( section 3.3 ) , which predicted @xmath159 .",
    "examination of table 1 shows that @xmath160 of the cluster candidates were identified by csearch using the smaller circles 1 and 2 , and consequently that formally the contamination of the sample should be 0.5 or less , and the completeness about 0.90 .",
    "therefore we can estimate that the sample of 477 candidates should contain @xmath161 clusters and that a complete sample obtained using csearch would have yielded @xmath162 clusters .",
    "therefore we can estimate that the overall completeness of the sample of selected clusters is @xmath163 .",
    "this incompleteness , which is the sum of the three effects summarised in section 2 , contributes to the flattening of the log n / log s distribution at fluxes below @xmath2 in the band @xmath1 ( section 5 ) .",
    "cc clusters of galaxies & 186 + active galactic nuclei ( agn ) & 127 + stars & 74 + extended x - ray emission regions & 5 + redundant rass-2 detections & 61 + sources below x - ray count - rate threshold & 24 +   + total & 477 +    the above argument implies that @xmath164 clusters have been missed in searching the 477 candidates .",
    "this has arisen in most cases while applying the criteria @xmath121 and @xmath138 to reject candidates , and in section 3.5.2 we have estimated that applying these criteria applied to a control sample of abell clusters should yield an incompleteness of @xmath165 .",
    "two examples of clusters with overly soft spectra are a2800 ( @xmath166 ) and the cluster @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) discovered by tucker et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in the emss . in neither case is the nature of the contaminating source clear .",
    "one limit of this study is that the criterion @xmath139 for selecting cluster candidates will inevitably discriminate against the more distant clusters of small angular extent , particularly those in which a cooling flow makes the x - ray source more compact .",
    "this loss is evident in the flattening of the log n - log s distribution at low flux ( section 5 ) .",
    "three aspects of the analysis bear out this trend .",
    "first , of the sources rejected because @xmath138 we identified at least 4 cases , where the x - ray / optical overlays showed suggestive but marginal evidence that they were clusters .",
    "second , there were 11 in our catalog of 186 clusters , for which the detection of angular extent appeared to be near its limits .",
    "the gca yielded a small but non - zero core radius , but simultaneously the ks - test yielded significant probabilities , between @xmath169 and @xmath170 percent , of the source being point - like .",
    "third , in the case of distant clusters accepted by csearch , cosmos classified some of the galaxies as faint objects , which the csearch analysis did not count .",
    "this is obvious in some of the x - ray / optical overlays of these objects , which show the dominant elliptical galaxy with halo surrounded by faint objects .",
    "therefore we conclude that some distant clusters may have been missed by csearch .",
    "in order to convert the rosat count - rate into an energy flux outside the galaxy , the spectrum of the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) has been convolved with the response functions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and the instrument .",
    "the plasma emissivity was derived using the version of the raymond & smith ( 1977 ) code installed in 1994 in the mpe exsas software .",

    "110 have measured redshifts .",
    "the sources of the incompleteness of the sgp catalog at low fluxes have been discussed in section 3.5.5 .",
    "in addition there is a steepening of the sgp log n - log s curve over a short range of hard band flux near @xmath196 , a characteristic evident to a lesser extent also in the results of de grandi et al .",

    "the distribution of the clusters in redshift space is summarised in the wedge diagram shown in figure [ f13 ] , in which the clusters are projected onto a plane whose co - ordinates are cluster redshift and right ascension .",
    "in this figure the symbol size is a measure of the cluster x - ray luminosity in the @xmath1 band .",
    "table 3 contains five sources , labelled dc in column 11 , for which the x - ray and optical data provide compelling evidence that they are interacting double clusters .",
    "in contrast the pair of objects rxcj0108.8 - 1524 and rxcj0108.9 - 1537 , which in projection are close , do not constitute a double cluster as they are well separated in redshift space .",
    "the former is a151 , which has a redshift of 0.0537 ( h. andernach 1989 , unpublished , private communication ) , whereas spectroscopic observation of the latter yield two redshifts which tie the galaxies to a151 but nine having a mean of @xmath198 ( katgert et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "in section 3.5.5 it was estimated from a comparison of the number of clusters detected in the sgp with the csearch predictions , that the sample completeness was 0.79 , and it was concluded that the missing ones were mainly distant clusters of small angular extent . the effect is to flatten the log n - log s distribution at low fluxes ( figure [ f12 ] ) , and using the following arguments we have established that the sample is essentially complete at fluxes greater than @xmath2 .",
    "first , we compare our log n - log s distribution with the results of deeper surveys , and of the wider field reflex and bcs surveys . at @xmath2 in the sgp distribution ( figure [ f12 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath199 . for deeper surveys , which have smaller fields and therefore limited statistics at this flux",
    ", we obtain @xmath200 ( rosati et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath201 ( vikhlinen et al . 1998 ) , @xmath202 ( henry et al . 2001 ) , and @xmath203 ( gioia et al . 2001 ) . for the reflex survey",
    "we obtain @xmath204 ( bhringer et al . 2001 ) and for the bcs survey @xmath205 ( ebeling et al .",
    "we find no evidence that the sgp result is inconsistent with these surveys at this flux threshold .",
    "second , we apply a standard measure of the formal completeness of a sample , namely the @xmath206 test ( e.g. , schmidt 1968 , avni & bahcall 1980 ) . for the computation of the maximum volume @xmath207 the effective area , the local variation of the x - ray flux limit ( both for a minimum of 10 source counts ) , and the @xmath180 correction ( see section 4 ) are taken into account .",
    "the test is performed for subsamples with different x - ray flux limits .",
    "the mean of the @xmath206 values and their @xmath208 standard deviations are plotted in figure [ f14 ] .",
    "note that the errors do not include cosmic variance .",
    "below @xmath209 the deviations from the ideal value of 0.5 are significant , indicating that the sample gets definitively incomplete below this flux limit . between @xmath210 and @xmath211",
    "it is difficult to make a definite statement about significant deviations from the 0.5 line because the large scale inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of the clusters ( see section 7 ) start to modulate the averaged @xmath206 values .",
    "note also that the measurements at different flux limits are not statistically independent .",
    "a good estimate of the flux completeness limit is @xmath212 , because for fluxes brighter than this limit the averaged @xmath206 values are all within the 90 percent confidence range ( note that cosmic variance increase the given formal errors ) .",
    "third , we examine the behavior of the radially averaged comoving cluster number density along the redshift direction .",
    "if we assume that within the tested redshift range no large evolutionary effects are present , one would expect an almost constant cluster number density profile with superposed large - scale inhomogeneities .",
    "figure [ f15 ] shows the superposition of a set of cluster number density profiles obtained from 10 volume - limited subsamples within the luminosity range @xmath213 to @xmath214 . outside this luminosity interval",
    "the sizes of the subsamples are smaller than 10 and are thus dominated by small - number statistics .",
    "the subsamples are restricted to clusters with at least 10 source counts and x - ray fluxes larger than @xmath215 , as obtained from the @xmath206 test mentioned above . the effective survey area covered by each subsample",
    "is taken into account .",
    "the individual density profiles are normalized using the average cluster number density estimated for each subsample .",
    "the bars in figure [ f15 ] represent the formal @xmath216 poisson errors , within which no systematic large - scale gradients of the number density are found for @xmath217 .",
    "the comparatively large high - density region found in the redshift interval @xmath218 is composed mainly of several superclusters .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the large - scale structure is given in section 7 .",
    "finally , we have verified that the variation of rass exposure time in the sgp field ( figure [ f1 ] ) has little effect on the effective area at a flux level of @xmath2 . at the detection threshold of the gca ( 10 source counts ) , this area is 98 percent of the total area of the field .",
    "the wedge diagram for the sgp cluster sample ( figure [ f13 ] ) reveals that the spatial density of clusters at redshifts greater than @xmath3 is too low for the purpose of tracing large - scale structure , and we concentrate the discussion on clusters within this limit .",
    "a detailed examination of large - scale structure in the southern sky was made by tully et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , who analysed the abell , corwin & olowin ( 1989 ) catalog of clusters . in this study",

    "the maximum values of these velocities were around @xmath221 ( @xmath222 ) .",

    "figure [ f18 ] is a sky map of all clusters in the sgp catalog ( table 3 ) having a redshift of less than @xmath224 , which shows clearly a concentration of clusters around the supergalactic equator ( figure [ f16 ] ) . of the 36 clusters identified by tully ( 1987 ) as members of the pisces - cetus supercluster ,",

    "a correlation in sky position is evident upon comparing figures [ f19 ] and [ f16 ] , and a correlation in redshift space is seen upon comparing figures [ f13 ] and [ f17 ] .",
    "second , the two bright clusters a2597 and a2670 , highlighted as black circles in the nw quadrant , were identified by tully ( 1987 ) as members of the aquarius supercluster .",
    "batuski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have performed redshift measurements recently which establish that aquarius a and b are essentially one filamentary structure almost aligned with the line - of - sight between @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "this concentration of abell clusters on the sky near @xmath237 , @xmath238 ( batuski et al .",
    "1999 ) is not evident in the x - ray data ( figure [ f19 ] ) .",
    "however , care is needed in interpreting this result as it may be biased by the relatively low exposure time in this part of the rass ( figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that , at least for redshifts out to @xmath33 , there is significant large - scale structure in the sgp field .",
    "however , there is one part of this structure which is not strongly evident in the x - ray maps shown in figure [ f18 ] and figure [ f19 ] .",
    "this is the horologium - reticulum supercluster ( tully et al .",
    "1992 ) , a rich association of clusters having its centroid at @xmath239 and located at the position shown in figure [ f16 ] .",
    "there is only one bright x - ray cluster in our survey , a3113 at ( @xmath240 , figure [ f19 ] ) and @xmath241 , which may be associated with this supercluster .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that the supercluster is inconspicuous because of its location close to the boundary of the sgp survey region .",
    "a systematic search of the rosat all - sky survey for clusters of galaxies has been performed in an area of @xmath242 centered on the south galactic pole .",
    "the search was made by correlating the list of rass sources detected in the hard x - ray band ( @xmath43 ) with the projected surface density of galaxies derived from the cosmos digitised uk schmidt iiia - j survey of the southern sky .",
    "the analysis yielded a list of 3236 candidates , of which @xmath243 should be chance associations with non - cluster sources , mainly agn and stars , and which should be 90 percent complete in containing clusters .",
    "the study was bounded during x - ray analysis by applying a lower limit of @xmath42 to the count - rate in the hard band , yielding a list of 477 candidates .",
    "non - cluster sources were removed by applying tests using the source x - ray extent and hardness ratio , by scrutiny of cosmos finding charts and overlays of the rass and cosmos images , and by correlation with such catalogs as the nasa extragalactic ( ned ) , simbad , tycho and veron data bases .",
    "this was performed in as objective a manner as possible , requiring an iterative sequence of procedures .",
