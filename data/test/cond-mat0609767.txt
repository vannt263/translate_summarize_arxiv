    "resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) is a technique that matures rapidly due to the recent increase in brilliance of the new generation synchrotron x - ray sources , where high flux photon beams with energies that are tunable to resonant edges are now becoming widely available  @xcite .",
    "the probability for x - rays to be scattered from a solid state system can be enhanced by orders of magnitude when the energy of the incoming photons is in the vicinity of an electronic eigenmode a resonant edge of the system .",
    "rixs experiments are performed on e.g. the k - edges of transition metal ions , where the frequency of the x - rays is tuned to match the energy of an atomic @xmath1-@xmath2 transition , which is around 5 - 10 kev  @xcite . at this resonant energy a @xmath1 electron from the inner atomic core is excited into an empty @xmath2 state , see fig . 1 .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the @xmath1 core - hole that is created has an ultrashort lifetime , of the order of femtoseconds .",
    "the reason is that the core - hole has a very high energy and is prone to decay via all sorts of radiative and non - radiative processes , severely cutting down the efficiency of rixs . in theoretical treatments of rixs",
    "this life - time effect is normally introduced as a core - hole broadening and disregarded from that point on .    in a previous study  @xcite , however , we have shown that from the theory perspective there is a great advantage of the very short lifetime of the core - hole .",
    "the ultrashort lifetime implies that for the other electrons in the system particularly for the slow ones that are close to the fermi - energy the core - hole potential is almost an instantaneous delta - function in time .",
    "this allows for a systematic expansion of the scattering cross section in terms of the lifetime , for which we present a detailed derivation and various generalizations in this paper .",
    "we shall see that the most important consequence of the ultrashort core - hole lifetime is that for indirect rixs the effective scattering cross section is proportional to the charge structurefactor @xmath0 and the longitudinal spin structure factor that is associated with it .",
    "the indirect rixs process is shown schematically in fig .",
    "1 . in transition metal systems",
    "the photo - electron is promoted from a @xmath1 core - orbital to empty @xmath2 states that are far ( 10 - 20 ev ) above the fermi - level .",
    "so the x - rays do not cause direct transitions of the @xmath1 electron into the lowest @xmath3-like conduction bands of the system .",
    "still rixs is sensitive to excitations of electrons near the fermi - level .",
    "the coulomb potential of @xmath1 core - hole causes e.g. very low energy electron - hole excitations in the valence / conduction band : the core - hole potential is screened by the valence electrons .",
    "when the excited @xmath2-electron recombines with the @xmath1 core - hole and the outgoing photon is emitted , the system can therefore be left behind in an excited final state .",
    "experimentally the momentum @xmath4 and energy @xmath5 of the elementary excitation is determined from the difference in energy and momentum between incoming and outgoing photons .",
    "since the excitations are caused by the core - hole , we refer to this scattering mechanism as _ indirect _ resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) .    at present energy resolutions of about 100 mev",
    "can be reached . in the near feature it seems experimentally feasible for rixs to become sensitive to the low energy excitations of the solid , where excitation energies are of the order of room temperature .",
    "recently it has been shown that also magnetic excitations , magnons , can be measured in rixs  @xcite .",
    "other interesting low - lying electronic excitations that potentially can be probes by rixs are , for example , collective features such as plasmons , orbitons , excitons , but also single - particle - like continua related to the band structure .",
    "rixs provides a new tool to study these elementary excitations .    for the interpretation of spectroscopic data",
    ", it is very important to express the scattering cross section for a technique in terms of physical correlation functions . in this paper , we derive in detail the dynamical correlation function that is measured in indirect resonant inelastic x - ray scattering . for local core - hole potentials and ultrashort lifetimes",
    ", the dynamical correlation function turns out to be a linear combination of the charge density and longitudinal spin density response function .",
    "we show that for a single band system the actual linear combination that is measured depends on the energy of the incoming photons and we determine the precise energy dependence of its coefficients .",
    "a sum - rule is derived and we generalize these results to the case of finite temperature and for multiband systems .",
    "the kramers - heisenberg formula  @xcite for the resonant x - ray scattering cross section at finite temperature is @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the final and initial state of the system , respectively .",
    "the sum is over all final states and the brackets denote the statistical average over initial states @xmath8 for a temperature @xmath9 .",
    "the momentum and energy of the incoming / outgoing photons is @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the loss energy @xmath12 is equal to the energy difference between the final and initial state @xmath13 . in the following",
    "we will take the groundstate energy of our system as reference energy : @xmath14 .",
    "the scattering amplitude @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 the resonant energy , @xmath18 denotes the intermediate states and @xmath19 the ( dimensionless ) dipole operator that describes the excitation from initial to intermediate state and the de - excitation from intermediate to final state .",
    "the energy of the incoming x - rays with respect to the resonant energy is @xmath20 ( this energy can thus either be negative or positive : @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 is the energy of intermediate state @xmath23 with respect to the resonance energy",
    ".    in the intermediate state a core - hole and a photo - excited electron are present .",
    "when we take the coulomb interaction between the intermediate state core - hole and the valence band electrons into account , we obtain a finite inelastic scattering amplitude . in that case",
    "there is a non - zero probability that an electron - hole excitation is present in the final state , see fig.1 .",
    "the intermediate state , however , is not a steady state .",
    "the highly energetic @xmath1 core - hole quickly decays e.g. via auger processes and the core - hole life - time is very short .",
    "the heisenberg time - energy uncertainty relationship then implies that the core - hole energy has an appreciable uncertainty .",
    "this uncertainty appears in the formalism above as the core - hole energy broadening @xmath24 which is proportional to the inverse core - hole life - time , which is of the order of electron volts as the lifetime is ultrashort , of the order of femtoseconds .",
    "note that the life - time broadening only appears in the intermediate states and not in the final or initial states as these both have very long life times .",
    "this implies that the core - hole broadening does not present an intrinsic limit to the experimental resolution of rixs : the loss energy @xmath5 is completely determined by kinematics .    when the incoming energy of the x - rays is equal to a resonant energy of the system @xmath25 and we see from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kramers],[eq : amplitude ] ) that the resonant enhancement of the x - ray scattering cross section is @xmath26 , which is @xmath27 for a transition metal k - edge  @xcite .    in a resonant scattering process ,",
    "the measured system is generally strongly perturbed .",
    "formally this is clear from the kramers - heisenberg formula  ( [ eq : kramers ] ) , in which both the energy and the wavefunction of the intermediate state where a potentially strongly perturbing core - hole is present appear .",
    "this is in contrast with canonical optical / electron energy loss experiments , where the probing photon / electron presents a weak perturbation to the system that is to be measured .    to calculate rixs amplitudes",
    ", one possibility is to numerically evaluate the kramers - heisenberg expression .",
    "to do so , all initial , intermediate and final state energies and wavefunctions need to be known exactly , so that in practice a direct evaluation is only possible for systems that , for example , consist of a small cluster of atoms  @xcite . in this paper , however , we show that under the appropriate conditions we can integrate out the intermediate states from the kramers - heisenberg expression . after doing so , we can directly relate rixs amplitudes to linear charge and spin response functions of the unperturbed system . for non - resonant scattering ,",
    "one is familiar with the situation that the scattering intensity is proportional to a linear response function , but for a resonant scattering experiment this is a quite unexpected result .",
    "let us proceed by formally expanding the scattering amplitude in a power series @xmath28 where we introduced the matrix elements @xmath29 the formal radius of convergence of this power series is given by @xmath30 , so that the series is obviously convergent when the incoming x - ray energy is e.g far enough below the resonance , i.e. when @xmath31 . but also at resonance , when @xmath32 the series is convergent for intermediate energies that are smaller than the core - hole broadening @xmath24 .",
    "thus this expansion is controlled for ultrashort core - hole lifetimes , which implies that @xmath24 is large . in the following we will be performing re - summations of this series .",
    "we denote the denominator of the expansion parameter @xmath33 by the complex number @xmath34 , so that @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the hamiltonian in the intermediate state .",
    "we thus obtain the following series expansion for the resonant cross section @xmath37",
    "we will first calculate the resonant x - ray cross section at zero temperature in the case where the valence and conduction electrons are effectively described by a single band of spinless fermions : spin , and orbital degrees of freedom of the valence electron system are suppressed .",
    "physically this situation can be realized in a fully saturated ferromagnet .",
    "the final and initial states of the system are determined by a hamiltonian @xmath38 that describes the electrons around the fermi - level .",
    "the generic form of the full many - body hamiltonian is @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote lattice sites with lattice vectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "note that the sum is over each pair @xmath44 once , with @xmath44 ranging from 1 to @xmath45 , where @xmath45 is the number of sites in the system .",
    "the hopping amplitudes of the valence electrons are denoted by @xmath46 and the @xmath47-operators annihilate / create such electrons .",
    "the coulomb interaction between valence electrons is @xmath48 , as the coulomb interaction only depends on the relative distance between two particles .",
    "the intermediate states are eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath49 , where @xmath50 accounts for the coulomb coupling between the intermediate state core - hole and the valence electrons : @xmath51 where @xmath52 creates a core - hole on site @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that the core - hole is fully localized and has no dispersion .",
    "we will see shortly that this leads to major simplifications in the theoretical treatment of indirect rixs . the core - hole  valence electron interaction is attractive : @xmath53 .",
    "the dipole operators are given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 creates a photo - excited electron in a @xmath2 state and @xmath56 denotes the hermitian conjugate of both terms .      in order to calculate the cross section ,",
    "we need to evaluate the operator @xmath57 in equation ( [ eq : mterms ] ) .",
    "a direct evaluation of this operator is complicated by the fact that @xmath58 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "we therefore proceed by approximating @xmath59 with a series that contains the leading terms to the scattering cross section for both strong and weak core - hole potentials , if the lifetime is short . after that we will do a full re - summation of that series .",
    "this approximation is central to the results in this paper .",
    "expanding @xmath60 gives a series with @xmath61 terms : @xmath62 using @xmath63 , this series reduces to @xmath64 \\hat{o}{\\left|\\textsc{i}\\right>}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using in addition that @xmath65 , we find @xmath66 \\hat{o}{\\left|\\textsc{i}\\right>}.      \\label{eq : exp_lhs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for strong core - hole potentials , the leading term of @xmath59 is @xmath67 .",
    "corrections to this term contain at least one factor of @xmath38 and are therefore smaller by a factor of at least @xmath68 .",
    "for weak core - hole potentials , the term @xmath69 vanishes because @xmath70=0 $ ] .",
    "the leading term for this limit therefore is @xmath71 .",
    "correction terms contain at least two factors of @xmath50 , which make them at least a factor of @xmath72 smaller .",
    "now we consider the approximation @xmath73 it can be seen that the leading order terms for both strong @xmath74 and weak @xmath75 core - hole potentials are included in the sum .",
    "the other terms are included only for mathematical convenience lateron ; they can be neglected if we consider either limit .",
    "note that the @xmath76 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_expand ] ) is @xmath77 , so that it can be removed from the sum . after performing the same manipulations as above",

    "( [ eq : exp_lhs ] ) and ( [ eq : exp_rhs ] ) , it can be seen that the approximation ( [ eq : h_expand ] ) is exact in the limit of both strong and weak core - hole potentials .",
    "we can also represent the series expansion and its approximation graphically ( fig .",

    "this corresponds to the widely used anderson impurity approximation in the theoretical analysis of e.g. x - ray absorption and photo - emission , introduced in refs .",
    "this approximation is reasonable as the coulomb potential is certainly largest on the atom where the core - hole is located .    in the present case ,",
