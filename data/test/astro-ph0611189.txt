    "in the last decade , thanks to the discovery and study of afterglow emission and host galaxies , it has been possible to estimate the redshift of several tens of gamma  ray bursts ( grbs ) , and thus to derive their distance scale , luminosities and other intrinsic properties . among these ,",
    "the correlation between the cosmological rest  frame spectrum peak energy , , and the isotropic equivalent radiated energy , , is one of the most intriguing and robust . indeed , as shown , initially by @xcite and , more recently , by @xcite , all long grbs with known redshift and estimated are consistent with the relation = k @xmath0 @xmath1 ( k @xmath275110 and @xmath3 @xmath20.40.6 , with in kev and in units of 10@xmath4 erg ) , with the only exception of grb980425 ( which is anyway a peculiar event under several other aspects ) .",
    "the correlation holds from the brightest grbs to the weakest and softest x  ray flashes ( xrfs ) and is characterized by a scatter in log ( ) of @xmath20.2 dex ( by assuming a gaussian distribution of the deviations ) .",
    "the implications and uses of the correlation include prompt emission physics , jet geometry and structure , testing of grb / xrf synthesis and unification models , pseudo  redshift estimators , cosmology ( when additional observables , like e.g. the break time of the optical afterglow light curve or the high signal time scale , are included @xcite ) ; see @xcite for a review .    in the recent years",
    "there has been a debate , mainly based on batse grbs without known redshift , about the impact of selection effects on the sample of grbs with known redshift and thus on the correlation .",
    "based on the analysis of batse grbs without known redshift , different conclusions were reported ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but with the general agreement that would allow us to test the correlation in a more stringent way :    * with respect , e.g. , to batse , the bat grb detector has a sensitivity which is comparable for grbs with peak energies above @xmath2100 kev , but much better for softer events ( e.g. , @xcite ) , thus reducing selection effects at the detection stage ; * the fast pointing capability permits few arcsec localizations with xrt and their dissemination to optical telescopes as early as @xmath2100 - 200s form grb onset , thus reducing selection effects at the redshift estimate stage ; this is clearly demonstrated by the fact the redshift estimates for grbs are more frequent and differently distributed with respect to the past ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in addition , thanks to the fast pointing capability , it is possible in some cases , to follow the later and softer phase of the prompt emission with xrt , thus providing a more accurate estimate of the peak energy ( as in the case of grb060218 @xcite ) . from the point of view of testing the correlation ,",
    "the only negative of is that bat , due to its limited energy band ( @xmath215350 kev ) , provides an estimate the spectral peak energy only for a small fraction ( 1520% ) of the events .",
    "fortunately , this is partially compensated by the simultaneous detection of several grbs by broad band experiments like hete2 , konus / wind and , more recently , rhessi and suzaku / wam , all capable to provide estimates of for most of the events detected by them .    .",
    "and values for grbs / xrfs with known redshift and firm estimates of ( or upper / lower limits to ) .",
    "all values have been taken from the literature or computed based on published spectral parameters and fluences , see last column for references ( an asterisk indicate that the references can be found at http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/archive/grb_table/ ) . for grb050724 , the first line corresponds to the short pulse , the second line to the soft tail .

    "the sample of long grbs with known redshift and published spectral peak energy consists of 17 events ; for other 5 events upper / lower limits to have been reported .",
    "these events are listed in table 1 ; for @xmath2half of the events , the values of ( or upper / lower limits to ) and are taken from @xcite ; for the others , they have been computed based on published spectral information following the method reported in @xcite and by assuming a cosmology with @xmath5 = 0.3 , @xmath6 = 0.7 and h@xmath7 = 6570 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 ( i.e. the uncertainties on take into account the uncertainty in the value of h@xmath7 ) . as can be seen in figure 1 ,",
    "all these events ( filled circles ) are fully consistent with the correlation as characterized by the best fit power  law and logarithmic scatter derived by @xcite .",
    "the fit with a power  law of the sample of 17 long grbs with firm estimates of @xmath9 and gives an index of 0.58@xmath100.01 and a normalization of 86@xmath103 ( in kev and in units of 10@xmath4 erg ) .",
    "consistently again with the findings based on data from previous satellites , despite the correlation is very significant ( the spearman s rank correlation coefficient between log ( ) and log ( ) of the 17 events is @xmath20.93 ) , the chi ",
    "square value obatined with the power ",
    "law fit is high ( 47/15 ) , confirming the presence of extra ",

    "an important breakthrough of the era is the discovery of afterglow emission from short grbs , leading to the first redshift estimates ( starting with grb050709 detected by hete2 ) for this elusive events .",
    "even if short grbs with known redshift are still a few , there is evidence that , as long grbs , they lie at comsological distances , even if at lower redshifts ( @xmath12@xmath20.7 ) . as can be seen in table 1 and figure 1 , only for 1 of short grbs ( 051221 )",
    "there is an estimate of ; the other short grb with known redshift and is grb050709 .",
    "as already shown by @xcite , both these events are inconsistent with the correlation ( see figure 3 ) . for the other short grbs , also reported in table 1 and shown in figure 1 ( diamonds ) , only _ approximate _ lower limits to can be inferred based on the photon indices estimated by fitting the bat spectra with a power  law . in all cases ,",
    "the photon index is hard enough to support the hypothesis of a peak energy at least higher than 100 kev ( the fits of bat spectra reported in gcns are typically performed in the 15 - 150 or 15350 kev energy band ) .",
    "more specifically , based on the reported photon indices and energy bands , the lower limit to the observer s frame peak energy was chosen to be 100 kev for grb050724 , 150 kev for grbs 050509b , 0605002b and 060505 , 200 kev for grb050813 . for each event , was computed by assuming varying between its lower limit and ( conservatively ) 10000 kev . despite its t@xmath13 of 4@xmath101 s ,",
    "i included grb060505 in the short grb sample , because of its very low fluence and hard spectrum ( typical features of short grbs ) and its duration anyway consistent with the tail of short grbs duration distribution ( see also @xcite ) . in figure 1",
    "it can be seen that all grbs with known redshift are inconsistent with the correlation ; in particular , they lie significantly above the region populated by long events .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the different location of long and short grbs in the plane is consistent with the different distributions of these two classes in the hardness  intensity diagram and",
    "can give important clues for the understanding of the differences in their emission mechanism(s ) and progenitors .",
    "under this point of view , of particular interest is the emerging evidence that at least some short grbs are followed by an extended , weak and soft emission . for one of the events included in the sample of short grbs with known redshift , grb050724 ,",
    "an estimate of the and of this soft component is available ( see table 1 ) , thanks to the joint fit of xrt and bat data @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , as can be seen in figure 1 , the extended soft emission of the short grb050724 is fully consistent with the correlation .",
    "this evidence , if confirmed by future observations , may suggest that the emission mechanisms responsible for most of the emission of long grbs could also be at work in short grbs but with a much lower efficiency .",
    "confidence region ( from @xcite).,width=415 ]",
    ", thanks to the combination of the high sensitivity of bat with the few arcsec source location accuracy of xrt and the very fast slewing capability of the spacecraft , is making possible a substantial reduction of selection effects in the sample of grbs with known redshift , and thus to test more stringently than in the past the correlation . as shown above , all long grbs with an estimate of ( 17 events ) or an upper / lower limit to this quantity ( 5 events ) are fully consistent with the correlation .",
    "the results of the correlation analysis and power  law fit of the these events , which cover more than 4 orders of magnitude in and 3 orders of magnitude in , are fully consistent with what found for events detected by previous satellites .",
    "this is a clear evidence , and a further confirmation , that the correlation is likely not an artifact of selection effects . + short grbs with known redshift ( 1 firm estimate of and 5 lower limits ) are inconsistent with the correlation , further confirming that different emission mechanisms ( possibly due to different conditions , progenitors or circum  burst environment ) with respect to long grbs are at work for this class of events .",
    "remarkably , the long , soft and weak tail following the short grb050724 is characterized by values of and fully consistent with the correlation holding for long grbs , suggesting that the emission mechanisms producing long grbs could be at work also for at least some short grbs but with much less efficiency .",
    "finally , figure 3 shows the location in the plane of grbs with known redshift and more accurate estimates of , a sample consisting of 51 long grbs plus 2 short grbs . as can be seen , a part the two short grbs ( 050709 and 051221 )",
