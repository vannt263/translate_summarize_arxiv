    "_ @xcite and is currently being pursued vigorously by several groups worldwide @xcite .",
    "one advantage of magnetic ucn storage versus storage in material bottles , the method used in a number of previous neutron lifetime measurements @xcite , is the potential absence of losses due to effects other than @xmath4-decay .",

    "is commonly assumed to be negligible . for systems using permanent magnets the question of gradual demagnetization over time appears to have found little attention so far .    until recently ucn depolarization estimates @xcite were based on majorana s quasi - classical result of 1932 @xcite for a free polarized particle with magnetic moment moving with constant velocity vector through a non - uniform static magnetic field of specific form .",
    "only its spin state was assumed to be affected by the magnetic field .",
    "this model predicted a depolarization probability @xmath5 for one passage through the field .",
    "this value decreases exponentially with the adiabaticity parameter @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the frequency of rotation of the field as seen from the reference frame of the moving particle , in the critical region where the field rotates fastest while the magnitude @xmath8 of the magnetic field may be small .",
    "@xmath9 is the larmor frequency . for magnetic field parameters",
    "as currently used or proposed for ucn storage , @xmath10 would be of order @xmath11 , thus immeasurably small .",

    "@xmath10 was estimated to be in the range @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "this is much larger than the majorana value but still negligible in any actual or projected neutron lifetime experiment .    using a simplified model of magnetic field distribution we extend the theory of @xcite to include arbitrary ucn motion with both vertical and horizontal velocity components , confined to the vertical space between upper and lower turning points that depend only on the ucn energy for vertical motion . in our model",
    "( introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] ) the magnetic field magnitude @xmath8 is uniform within any horizontal plane , so there is no horizontal component of magnetic force",
    ". therefore the neutron moves with constant velocity in the horizontal @xmath14- and @xmath15- directions .",
    "we show that @xmath10 could reach a level approaching the tolerance limit for a high precision neutron lifetime measurement unless precautions are taken .",
    "as is well known the most critical issue is the choice of a stabilization field perpendicular to the magnetic mirror field , of sufficient strength so that the depolarization rate will be negligible in a neutron lifetime experiment .",
    "our model field is close to the `` bathtub configuration '' of ref .  @xcite but the lateral confinement of ucns , achieved there by double curvature of the magnetic mirror , is simulated differently .",
    "the magnetic mirror is horizontal and extends to infinity in both lateral dimensions .",
    "however , one could imagine the presence of ideal vertical mirrors reflecting the ucns back and forth in the horizontal directions without any change in the analysis .",
    "more specifically , we use an infinite ideal planar halbach array @xcite , which is free of the field ripples present in actual realizations @xcite . in the design of ref .",
    "@xcite , the ripples are important only within about 1 mm of the surface of the magnets .",
    "this region is not reached by the ucns whose maximum energy ( for vertical motion ) is @xmath345 nev ( for the parameters in @xcite ) , since they reverse their flight direction before entering this zone .",
    "using this model of field distribution we have also studied the problem of depolarization of ucns in reflection from a non - magnetic mirror immersed in a non - uniform magnetic field .",
    "this question is important as a mechanism that may limit the efficiency of ucn polarizers based on transmission through a magnetic field . for a sufficiently strong field",
    ", neutrons in only one spin state can pass the field to proceed to the experiment .",
    "otherwise they are reflected .",
    "however , following the polarizer the ucns are usually reflected on trap or guide walls exposed to the stray field of the polarizer and thus may lose their 100% polarization if the reflection process involves depolarization .",
    "moreover , a possible depolarization on non - magnetic trap walls in a magnetic field is highly relevant in measurements of the neutron decay asymmetry parameter @xmath0 using ultracold neutrons @xcite .",
    "this problem has first been investigated by pokotilovski @xcite who used an adaptation of the majorana model to the reflection geometry . in the present work we study certain aspects of this problem by imagining a horizontal lossless non - magnetic ucn mirror inserted at a variable height into the magneto - gravitational storage space .",
    "the net depolarization per bounce on this mirror will be compared to the depolarization for one bounce in the magnetic field in the absence of the mirror to obtain an estimate for the depolarization effect of the mirror .",
    "the topic of ucn depolarization in magnetic storage or in mirror reflection in a magnetic field raises interesting questions of quantum interpretation .",

    "the curve is strongly peaked at the critical level where the field rotates fastest in the reference frame of the moving neutron .",
    "this behavior is the same as displayed by the majorana result @xcite ( where it is more difficult to deduce since the author used a quantization axis fixed in space rather than rotating together with the field ) . in a semi - classical interpretation ,",
    "as the ucn starts moving from one turning point , say the upper one , down toward the lower one , the spin vector rotates away from the quantization axis ( which was chosen parallel to the local magnetic field vector in ref .",
    "it reaches a certain maximum angle around the critical zone ; then this rotation is reversed and ends at a much smaller value at the next turning point for ucn motion .",
    "this indicates that an analyzer of neutron polarization placed at different heights would show a variation of depolarization by many orders of magnitude ( @xmath16 8 decades for the example shown in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) over the vertical range of the storage space .",
    "the depolarization rate expected for an actual ucn magnetic storage experiment , without any polarization analyzer intersecting the beam , is determined by the current of ucns in the `` wrong '' spin state , i.e. of high - field seekers leaving the system at the lower and upper turning points while the `` correct '' ( high - field repelled ) state is reflected and returns to the storage space .",
    "this association of net depolarization with loss currents is consistent with the following interpretation : at the turning points a measurement is performed ( in the sense of quantum mechanics ) , conceptually by neutron detectors placed just below the bottom and just above the top of the storage region for a given ucn energy for vertical motion . these detectors would intersect the ucns in the `` wrong '' spin state as they exit the storage system . in the copenhagen interpretation ,",
    "such a measurement ( actual or hypothetical ) resets the ucn wave function to a pure state of high - field repelled neutrons .",
    "the spin state then evolves as described by the spin - dependent schrdinger equation ( or its semi - classical analog ) until the next `` measurement '' takes place at the following turning point and the process of wave collapse and wave evolution is repeated .",
    "alternative interpretations are conceivable but we will use the picture outlined above .    following ref .",
    "@xcite we use the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation to solve the spin - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "this appears justified since the spatial variation of field variables ( gravitational potential and magnetic field * b * ) is much slower than the variation of ucn wave function .",
    "the scales are of order cm for gravity and * b * , and of order @xmath17 m or less for the neutron wavelength .",
    "we are aware of the fact that an exact treatment of ucn depolarization in magnetic storage may involve quantum electrodynamics since the moving neutron , in its reference frame , is affected by a time - dependent electromagnetic field , i.e. by low - energy photons .",
    "we will also neglect temporal fluctuations of the field due to mechanical vibrations or , if electromagnets are used for field generation , ac components of the current supply .",

    "<S> this problem is of preeminent importance in polarized neutron decay studies such as the measurement of the asymmetry parameter @xmath0 using ultracold neutrons , and it may limit the efficiency of ultracold neutron polarizers based on passage through a high magnetic field . </S>"
