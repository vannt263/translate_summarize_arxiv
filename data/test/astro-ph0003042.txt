    "among known soft gamma- ray repeaters to date , only sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806 - 20 are the objects for which a secular spin - down of the pulse periods ( 5.16 s and 7.47 s accordingly ) with @xmath2 of order @xmath3s / s was detected and thereby was established that these sgrs are neutron stars with a superstrong magnetic field of order @xmath4 g ( kouveliotou et al . 1998 ; kouveliotou et al . 1999 ) , called as a `` magnetars '' ( duncan & thompson 1992 ) .",
    "since the end of 1998 we carried out the observations of the sgr 1900 + 14 at low frequency ( 111 mhz ) and have detected the periodic pulsed radio emission from this magnetar ( shitov 1999 ) . in this paper",
    "we report the results of our observations obtained till august 1999 .",
    "the observations of the magnetar sgr 1900 + 14 were started since 1998 december using the bsa radio telescope operating now at the new frequency of 111 mhz . ( in 1998 october bsa - wavelength dipole array with dimensions of 187 x 384 m , transit time of @xmath5 - was reconstructed to shift the previous operating frequency of 102.5 mhz to the new one of 111 mhz ( kutuzov et al .",
    "1999 ) ) we used 128 x 20 khz filterbank receiver and multichannel recording system to record the individual pulses during the bsa transit time .",
    "different sampling intervals of 22.6816 and 20.1728 ms were used .",
    "all further processing procedures : cleaning of the noise signal in a each frequency channel , dedispersion , spectral analysis , the folding of dedispersed data for integrated pulse profile and the timing analysis were made `` off line '' .",
    "for the first time we have detected pulsed with 5.161-s period radio emission from sgr 1900 + 14 in 1998 december 12 , when as result of dedispersion procedures the integrated pulse profile with a good enough signal / noise ratio appeared with a dispersion measure ( dm ) of about @xmath6 .",
    "it was surprising that the revealed profile was quite narrow , with the width of about @xmath7 .",
    "the next radio detection of sgr 1900 + 14 like the first one was only in 1999 january 6 ( note that between this dates the antenna array was often covered by hoar - frost ) . fig .",
    "1 demonstrates these two detection of the sgr signals at 111 mhz .    during subsequent regular observations",
    "the pulses from sgr 1900 + 14 with the same dm values and similar pulse width of about 100 ms were detected repeatedly .",
    "the estimated for the best records mean flux density at 111 mhz is approximately 50 mjy .",
    "the measured value of @xmath8 .",
    "so far as the period derivative @xmath2 was known for the magnetar with the limited accuracy the pulses were recorded in a unpredictable phases ( fig.2 , left ) till the middle of january 1999 when @xmath9 and @xmath2 were improved as a result of the timing analysis .",
    "fig.2 ( right ) demonstrates some pulse profiles of sgr 1900 + 14 , the phase of which aligned in an accordance with the timing solution .    there were a number of records in which we have detected interpulses with amplitude ( and , of course , dispersion measure ) like the main pulse , and which were located in different phases .",
    "two examples of these interpulses are seen in fig . 2 ( 09 01 99 and 17 06 99 ) .",
    "for timing analysis of our data as the initial parameters of sgr 1900 + 14 we used the values of p = 5.160199(2 ) s , @xmath10 s / s , mjd = 51056.0 , obtained by kouveliotou et al .",

    "12 1998 - jan .",
    "14 1999 , after that in the subsequent observations with improved parameters the pulses were detected in the precalculated phases . in iauc 7110",
