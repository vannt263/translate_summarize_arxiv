    "cluster samples used for this purpose are usually complete in terms of x - ray and redshift measurements such as the rdcs ( rosati et al .",
    "1998 , borgani et al . 1999 ) and the macs survey ( ebeling , edge , & henry 2001 , ebeling et al . 2007 ) that we examine here with lensing .",
    "ideally , controlled samples of clusters with reliable lensing masses would allow the most direct comparison with theory but these are presently still in their infancy with only a handful of clusters discovered in wide - field weak lensing searches ( taylor et al .",

    "2006 ) in a large number of clusters over a wide redshift range should improve upon x - ray selection , due to the redshift - independence of the effect ( though clearly high redshift clusters are relatively less well resolved ) .",
    "also , since the insensitivity of the effect to internal gas density variations will not be biased as with x - ray flux selection towards systems with luminous shocked gas , measurements should better correlate with cluster masses .",
    "strong gravitational lensing ( sl ) is nearly always seen in sufficiently detailed observations of massive clusters .",
    "einstein radii derived from such observations provide a reliable projected mass within the observed einstein radius , which depends only on fundamental constants , g and c , and knowledge of the lens and source distances .",
    "constraining the inner mass profile from sl is much harder , requiring many sets of multiple images covering a wide range of source redshift , to overcome inherent lensing degeneracy between the gradient of the mass profile and the scaling of the bend angle with source distance , so that sl based mass profiles have been usefully constrained for only several clusters producing reliable mass maps ( e.g. , abell 370 , kneib et al .",

    "there is a significant inconsistency between the einstein radius directly measured from sl analyses and the einstein radius predicted from model profiles fitted to weak - lensing measurements of the same clusters , often subject to background selection and dilution problems over a wide radial range ( e.g. , medezinski et al .",
    "2010 ) , though more so towards the sl regime where the degree of contamination by cluster members is often poorly corrected .",
    "the importance of a sl analysis of a significant sample is clear , especially in the statistical aspect , where the modelling method is similar for all examined clusters and thus supplies a coherent view for objective comparison ( e.g. , richard et al .",

    "note that these values quoted here are calculated from the corresponding tables in these papers , and are not necessarily scaled or normalised to certain lens and source redshifts .",
    "other recent work more relevant to our study summarises sl analysis for a sample of 20 , mostly relaxed _",
    "undisturbed _ clusters ( richard et al .",
    "they find that the einstein radii are distributed log - normally with a peak at @xmath24 and a corresponding @xmath25 enclosed mass ( within r@xmath26250 kpc ) , and show that the predicted distribution of einstein radii from @xmath9cdm cosmology falls short of the observed einstein radii by a factor of 2 .",
    "it has been claimed that much larger einstein radii can be contemplated only with mass distributions which are highly prolate and aligned along the line of sight ( corless & king 2007 , oguri & blandford 2009 , see also hennawi et al .",

    "we adopt the standard cosmology ( @xmath27 , @xmath28,@xmath29 ) .",

    "we make use of some other hst data available in the hubble legacy archive ( hla ) , which we list in table [ sample ] .",
    "in addition , available sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) photometry catalogues were also downloaded from the hla , and were used to construct colour - magnitude diagrams for identifying the red cluster sequence galaxies belonging to each cluster , as a starting point for each lensing model , as detailed in  [ model ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the 12 clusters have effective einstein radii in the range , 11@xmath13 to 55@xmath13 , with a median value of @xmath31 , ( and a mean value of @xmath32 ) assuming a fixed source redshift of @xmath33 , see figure [ hist ] .",
    "this corresponds to a range of physical radii , 68 kpc to 353 kpc , with a median value of 180 kpc , when transforming to the redshift of each lens . in the hierarchical model large - scale perturbations",
    "collapse recently and thus should be found relatively locally .",
    "this sample includes very large einstein radii , exceeding even the most impressive lenses previously studied at lower redshifts as analysed by broadhurst & barkana ( 2008 ) .",
    "more recently , richard et al . ( 2009b ) carefully studied the lensing properties of 20 mainly undisturbed clusters at lower-@xmath3 , selected to have sl features in hubble data and measured x - ray data , for which their mean einstein radius is @xmath24 , a factor of @xmath34two smaller than our sample .",
    "this difference reflects the larger masses of the macs sub - sample that we studied , which is purely x - ray flux selected and restricted to @xmath0 .",
    "this macs sample therefore does not suffer from a lensing - selection bias , but the effect of projection bias must be taken into account when evaluating 2d lensing observations with 3d mass profiles predicted by theory ( e.g. , hennawi et al .",

    "to @xmath35 .",
    "the solid curve is the expected distribution of einstein radii as calculate in  [ cdm ] for the @xmath9cdm model , incorporating both the scatter on the @xmath36 relation and the projection bias from lensing .",
    "we multiply the resulting theoretical @xmath37 curve by the width of the bins to normalise it .",
    "the observed distribution is skewed to larger einstein radii than predicted .",
    "the median values of both the observed and the theoretical distributions are plotted on the histogram in a blue dashed line , and a black dash - dotted line , respectively.,width=302 ]    cdm model ( black solid curve ) described in  [ cdm].the median values of both the observed and the theoretical cumulative distributions are plotted on the histogram in a blue dashed line , and a black dash - dotted line , respectively.,width=302 ]    , is tightly followed by the data , indicating that in general the central mass distributions of these clusters are well behaved.,width=302 ]     with the system scale size is apparent .",
    ", width=302 ]    most of these clusters have resisted analysis by strong lensing despite the long availability of the hubble data .",
    "our success in `` cracking '' these irregular lenses and defining their critical curves is encouraging for the application of our approach to complex unrelaxed clusters more generally .",
    "for such clusters , where the deflection fields are not symmetric , the identification of multiple images must be aided by models that allow for flexibility in describing the mass distribution , as described in section [ model ] , free of the strictures imposed by the use of idealised elliptical potentials in conventional models .",
    "the masses enclosed by the critical curves range from @xmath38 to @xmath39 with a median value of @xmath40 , and a mean value of @xmath41 as shown in table [ results_table ] .",
    "these are calculated for each cluster by integrating the surface mass density distribution within the 2d model critical curve , scaled to a source redshift of @xmath42 .",
    "we examine the relation between these einstein masses , @xmath43 enclosed within the critical curves , and the effective einstein radii derived above .",
    "theoretically this should of course simply scale as @xmath44 for symmetric lenses . here",
    "the lenses are not symmetric , but as can be seen in figure [ reme ] the quadratic relation is tightly followed , indicating that asymmetry is not very significant in terms of the mass distribution , and furthermore the measured or assumed redshifts of @xmath45 for the relevant systems is a reliable estimate .",
    "in fact , we see clearly in that the 2d mass distributions are in general noticeably rounder than the critical curves which are very sensitive to substructure , as can be seen by comparing the 2d mass distributions with the critical curves , shown in figures [ curves0018 ] - [ contours2214 ] .",
    "further encouragement for the accuracy of sl mass estimates is presented in recent work by meneghetti et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , showing that sl methods based on parametric modelling are accurate at the level of few percent at predicting the projected inner mass .",
    "richard et al .",
    "( 2009b ) found a mean mass of @xmath25 enclosed mass ( within r@xmath26250 kpc ) for their sample of 20 clusters , while smith et al .",
    "( 2005 ) examined the mass distribution of 10 x - ray selected clusters , and found a similar mean mass of @xmath46 ( see also richard et al .",
    "these values are in good agreement with our sample median mass ( @xmath40 ) , and slightly lower than our sample mean mass which is boosted by few extremely massive clusters ( e.g. , macs j0717.5 + 3745 ) .",
    "we examine the behaviour of the central mass - to - light ratio , @xmath47 , with the einstein radius and shown in figure [ ml ] .",
    "the luminosity is summed over all cluster sequence galaxies identified as described in section [ model ] .",
    "a clear correlation is obtained such that @xmath47 increases with the einstein radius , and with values quite typical of other massive clusters ( sarazin 1988 , rines et al .",
    "2004 , medezinski et al .",
    "this scaling towards higher @xmath48 provides confidence in our method . at the high mass end",
    "our result is similar to the peak",
    "m / l found in the detailed weak lensing profile studies of medezinski et al .",
    "measuring @xmath47 in high-@xmath3 clusters is of interest also for the added insight on the amount of dm initially associated with individual galaxies as compared with the overall cluster dm component ( see also sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "as can be seen in table [ results_table ] , most of the sample clusters provide large regions ( @xmath49 ) of highly magnified ( @xmath50 ) sky , useful for the search of the first stars and galaxies ( e.g. , zackrisson et al .",
    "one has to be cautious when making such a statement since unlike the critical curves and the enclosed mass , the magnification is sensitive to the mass profile which requires source redshift estimation for several sources , which we have here for only a few clusters ( section [ model ] ) .",
    "still , as explained in  2 , reasonable constraints are put on the mass profile slope by the image - plane minimisation , which generally has a broad minimum at the same point in the parameter space where the slope is also approximately correct . in addition , we are able to put a lower boundary on the high magnification area , by choosing the steeper profiles which naturally generate lower magnifications , or by assuming a boosted redshift for the main multiply - lensed system decreasing the lensing distance ratio for high-@xmath3 galaxies .",
    "thus we constrain the area of high magnification for a high-@xmath3 source at the current limit of @xmath8 , showing that most of this sample clusters are excellent targets for high-@xmath3 galaxy searches due to these large high - magnification areas and lens power .",
    "we estimate , based on previously analysed clusters ( e.g. , cl 0024 + 1654 , zitrin et al .",
    "2009b ; macs j1149.5 + 2223 , zitrin & broadhurst 2009 ; macs j0717.5 + 3745 , zitrin et al .",
    "2009a ) that in practice the areas of high magnification are about 10 - 20% higher than the lower limits presented in table [ results_table ] , with an upper limit of about 40 - 50% .",
    "we generally follow broadhurst & barkana ( 2008 ; see also sadeh & rephaeli 2008 ) in constructing the theoretically predicted distribution of einstein radii . in particular , we adopt the nfw parameters measured by neto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for simulated halos , although we reduce @xmath51 by @xmath52 according to the results of duffy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) who used the more recently measured values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "studies based on large numerical simulations ( zhao et al .",
    "2003,2009 , gao et al .",
    "2008 ) have found for massive halos a rather weak decline of @xmath51 with increasing redshift ; we neglect this decline , which renders our results ( in terms of the disagreement with observations ) conservative .",
    "we then correct the concentration parameter distribution using hennawi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to obtain the effective parameters for the population of clusters observed in projection .",
    "note though that here we are considering a sample selected by x - ray flux ( not lensing cross - section ) , so there is no lensing bias , but there still is the projection bias ; this refers to the fact that when halos are seen in projection ( at randomly distributed angles ) , a different effective projected @xmath51 is measured than would be obtained from a spherical analysis of the halo density profile . in particular , projection increases the mean @xmath51 and adds substantially to the scatter compared to the distribution of the spherically - measured @xmath51 .",
    "neto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) split their halo sample into two groups ( `` relaxed '' and `` unrelaxed '' ) and analysed the statistics of each group separately , so we do the same , and in the end combine the two groups according to their relative numbers in the simulation by neto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , obtaining our predicted results for the total , combined population of halos .",
    "this can then be compared with the observed sample , which does not select for relaxed clusters but includes both relaxed and unrelaxed ones .    in order to approximately simulate a flux - selected sample ,",
    "we need to convert @xmath53 to halo mass .",
    "we use the power - law relation from reiprich & bhringer ( 1999 ; with an updated hubble constant ) , along with the observed scatter of @xmath53 for a given mass , which we model as a lognormal distribution with a typical scatter that corresponds to a factor of 1.5 . note that this observed relation is based on @xmath54 , while the results from the above simulations refer to @xmath55 , so we must include the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath55 which is itself a function of @xmath51 .",
    "an important caveat is that the observed @xmath56 relation was measured for relaxed clusters ( whose mass could be estimated from the x - ray emission assuming hydrostatic equilibrium ) .",
    "we expect that unrelaxed clusters would tend to have an unusually high @xmath53 for a given mass ( e.g. , in a post - merger phase ) , which would insert more low - mass clusters within the sample than we assume , leading to smaller predicted einstein angles , increasing the discrepancy between the theory and the observations ( again making our results conservative ) .",
    "on the other hand , it should be noted that much of the scatter in the @xmath56 relation probably arises from cool cores in the center ( since it is significantly reduced if the inner core is excised ) , implying a possible bias towards relaxed and more concentrated systems .",
    "however , such a bias seems less probable in our case due to the high x - ray luminosity , the relatively high redshift , and the clear spread - out appearance of most of the clusters analysed here .",
    "the observed properties of each halo ( flux , einstein radius distribution , etc . )",
    "change slowly with redshift , so to simplify the calculation we approximate the clusters as all lying at a typical redshift @xmath57 . however , the halo abundance changes rapidly with redshift , so we calculate the integrated halo mass function for all halos observed at @xmath0 , in the fraction of the sky corresponding to the macs survey ( around a quarter of the sky ) .",
    "we use the sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) formula , which accurately fits the halo mass function ( i.e. , the distribution of @xmath55 ) measured in simulations .",
    "this halo mass function was convolved with with the @xmath51 distribution to obtain the distribution of @xmath54 , and then add the @xmath58 scatter in order to obtain the halo mass function corresponding to selection by a given minimum flux .",
    "since the @xmath58 relation is not strictly valid for unrelaxed clusters , we only use the power - law and the scatter from this relation but allow some flexibility in the normalisation , choosing an effective minimum flux that corresponds to a predicted abundance of 12 clusters ( as in the observed sample ) .",
    "this is reasonable also since we are interested here in testing the predicted @xmath59 distribution , not in testing the predicted cluster abundance .",
    "note that the flux selection does not affect the distribution of the very highest @xmath59 values , since all clusters within the survey solid angle at @xmath0 that can produce the largest @xmath59 s will be well above the flux threshold .",
    "given our predicted , x - ray selected mass function in terms of @xmath54 , we must convolve it with the @xmath59 distribution of each halo of mass @xmath54 . from the simulations we have the @xmath51 distribution ( and thus also the @xmath59 and @xmath54 distribution ) for a given @xmath55 , but we can invert this conditional probability using bayes theorem .",
    "note that the @xmath55 to @xmath54 conversion should not really include the projection bias that is included in @xmath59 , but having two different @xmath51 distributions for each @xmath55 would makes things far more complicated .",
    "our simplification of using a single @xmath51 distribution is reasonable since the projection bias typically affects @xmath54 ( for a given @xmath55 ) only by @xmath60 .",
    "also , since @xmath51 affects both @xmath54 and @xmath59 in the same direction , the effect on our final result ( which derives @xmath59 for a given @xmath54 ) is much smaller .",
    "our predicted @xmath59 distribution is compared to the observations in figure [ histr ] .",
    "we compare the two cumulative distributions @xmath61 , i.e. , the total number of clusters expected above @xmath59 , where the theoretical distribution has been normalised ( as noted above ) to agree with the total of 12 clusters in the sample .",
    "the observed distribution clearly lies at higher einstein radii compared with the predicted distribution .",
    "one indication of this is the most discrepant cluster , j0717.5 + 3745 with @xmath62 .",
    "the theoretical calculation yields a probability of only @xmath63 of finding such a large @xmath59 in this @xmath0 cluster sample , giving a significant ( though not extreme ) 2-@xmath64 discrepancy .",
    "more generally , the observed distribution resembles the predicted one except offset towards higher angles by about a factor of 1.4 ( comparing , for example , the two medians ) .",
    "the standard k - s statistic for comparing two distributions gives a probability of @xmath65 that the observed distribution is drawn from the predicted one .",
    "this is also around a 2-@xmath64 discrepancy , largely independent of the above number since the k - s statistic focuses on the middle portion of the probability distributions and is insensitive to the edges .",
    "the relatively low significance of the k - s discrepancy is an inevitable result of the poisson fluctuations expected with a sample of only 12 clusters .",
    "the discrepancy that we find , of einstein radii that are too high by about a factor of 1.4 , appears smaller than the roughly factor of 2 difference found by broadhurst & barkana ( 2008 ) .",
    "this may be explained at least partially by the difference between a lensing selected and an x - ray selected sample .",
    "a more robust comparison would be possible with an x - ray selected cluster sample in which the clusters have reliable virial masses measured using weak lensing .",
    "another caveat is that we have compared the observed einstein radii with the predictions based on pure dark matter simulations .",
    "the possible effect of baryons on the halo density profile has been difficult to study with simulations , since hydrodynamic simulations that produce a large effect do so along with a central baryon concentration that disagrees with observations and is due to the `` overcooling '' problem in simulations .",
    "analytical models suggest that even without producing a central baryon concentration , the complex coupled history of baryon and dark matter accretion may allow the baryons to significantly affect the final central density profile , potentially alleviating the discrepancy at least partially ( barkana & loeb 2010 ) .",
    "on the other hand , recent simulations suggest that the discrepancy actually increases when agn feedback is taken into account to overcome the overcooling problem ( duffy et al .",
    "2010 ) .      in this work",
    "we determine the einstein radii and projected masses for the 12 clusters of the @xmath0 macs sample , and compare these to simulations .",
    "we make use of our well - established modelling method to identify many sets of multiply - lensed images which are in turn used to constrain the models , and determine the einstein radii and projected masses for @xmath66 .",
    "typical uncertainties in the source redshift estimates of @xmath67 impose only minor uncertainties on the comparison with @xmath9cdm .",
    "firstly , such an uncertainty does not enable a unique determination of the profile slope , which we do not attempt to fully constrain here since both the einstein radius and the projected mass are indifferent to the mass profile slope and are determined by the data .",
    "secondly , overestimating a source redshift would in practice increase the projected mass and the observed einstein radius for a source at @xmath68 , while maintaining the relation seen in figure [ reme ] and thus resulting only in growth of the discrepancy from @xmath9cdm simulations which are not dependent on the observed mass . on the other hand , underestimating a source redshift would in practice decrease the observed einstein radius and projected mass for a source at @xmath68 by less than 10% , thus insignificantly influencing the results .",
    "the macs @xmath0 sample has proven to be of great value for many very different studies spanning the x - ray through radio spectrum . we have extracted additional useful information from this sample by solving the strong lensing for these clusters .",
    "previous discoveries from this sample include the largest lensed images of a highly - magnified distant spiral galaxy ( macs j1149.5 + 2223 ; zitrin & broadhurst 2009 , smith et al .",
    "2009 ) , the largest known lens ( macs j0717.5 + 3745 ; zitrin et al .",
    "2009a ) , lensed sub - mm sources ( takata et al .",
    "2003 , borys et al .",
    "2004 , berciano alba et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) , and another `` bullet cluster '' ( macs j0025.4 - 1222 ; brada et al .",
    "2008b ) .",
    "we presented mass models and the corresponding critical curves for the 12 high-@xmath3 x - ray luminous clusters of the sample via strong - lensing analysis in hst / acs images .",
    "several of these clusters have only a few strongly - lensed images and corresponding low masses and einstein radii , while most are very massive and rich with multiply - lensed arcs due to large critical area and high lens power .",
    "the equivalent einstein radii of this sample range from 11@xmath13 to 55@xmath13 with a median value of @xmath1 ( similar to the mean value ) , or 180 kpc .",
    "the corresponding masses enclosed within these curves range from @xmath38 to @xmath39 with a median value of @xmath40 , and a mean value of @xmath41 .",
    "we find that the enclosed mass follows tightly the quadratic relation with the equivalent einstein radius , indicating that the deviation from symmetry is not prominent in these clusters and that our measurements are highly accurate given the measured or assumed redshifts .",
    "in addition , we have shown that @xmath47 increases as expected with the scale size of the system , or einstein radius .",
    "we compare these results to the predictions of @xmath9cdm taking into account projection biases and find that these predictions fall short of our measured einstein radii by a factor of @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , the standard k - s statistic gives a probability of only @xmath65 that the observed distribution is drawn from the predicted one , corresponding to a @xmath69 discrepancy .",
    "it is apparent that the observed einstein radii and implied high masses are not likely at high redshifts in the context of the @xmath9cdm model when no lensing - selection biases are involved , showing again possible tension with the prediction of the standard model . finally , as a result of their unrelaxed mass distributions , most of these clusters cover a very large area ( @xmath70 ) of high magnification ( @xmath50 ) making them primary targets for high-@xmath3 galaxy searches , for which substantial hst time will shortly be forth - coming .    it should be acknowledged that theoretical predictions may clearly entail further uncertainties than those taken into account here , and a revised and more thorough analysis is needed in order to obtain higher significance results once source redshifts are available .",
    "such comparisons should also be independently applied to other large samples , so that a significant number of clusters are compared to the @xmath9cdm model in order to statistically support any claimed discrepancy .",
