    "the transformation takes place between a major component acting as a solvent and an initially solvated phase . the precipitation process of the solvated phase is usually considered to happen in three main stages ; phase nucleation , phase growth , and finally a coarsening process leading to a homogenisation of microstructural geometrical properties@xcite . further below",

    "tricalcium silicate is a well crystallized compound ( @xmath15 ) and the employed powders typically have specific surface areas of order of @xmath16@xcite .",
    "rapidly after mixing the cement particles start to dissolve .",
    "the principal reaction products are solvated ions ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) diffusing within the solvent .",
    "the ion concentrations are bounded themselve by finite solubility products above which hydrate phases start to precipitate from solution , preferable on surfaces of already existing hydrates .",
    "there are two associated hydrates , a ) the cement hydrate ( @xmath20 ) and b ) the portlandite ( @xmath21 ) , which compete for the common calcium and hydroxyl ions . the cement hydrate ( @xmath22 ) is amorphous in contrast to the crystalline portlandite ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the process of cement dissolution , ion diffusion , and hydrate precipitation is usually referred as ` cement hydration ' .",

    "we have selected from the literature results obtained taking this condition into account@xcite .",
    "nmr signal intensities , @xmath31 , are in general proportional to the absolute number @xmath32 of excited silicon nuclei of species @xmath27 within the sample , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 being the constant of the measurement ( species @xmath27 denotes a silicon nuclei belonging to a monomer , dimer , or trimer silicon cluster ) .",

    "( [ net - reaction ] ) and ( [ schematic - net - reaction ] ) are _ inconsistent _ in the limit of infinite dilution .",

    "( [ net - reaction ] ) can not be completed for _ chemical _ reasons , if @xmath48 or equivalently if @xmath49 .",
    "it is , a priori , difficult to judge whether the employed experimental water / cement ratio @xmath50 is sufficiently large in order to exclude a systematic effect on hydration due to limiting water .",
    "however , as we will see further below , considering the kinetics of the ` deacceleration ' period , water is very unlikely a chemically limiting reactant .",

    "( [ net - reaction ] ) .",
    "the determination of such a dependency , would require a set of experiments , conducted for different initial water to cement ratios .",

    "preferable this could be done by examination of the hydration rate dependence for different initial @xmath51 admixtures , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "bearing the foregoing caveats in mind , it should be obvious why we consider the schematic reaction ( [ schematic - net - reaction ] ) .",
    "we are only in position to characterize the kinetic influence of reactants and products on the cement hydration .",
    "but already this limited information will be , in our opinion , informative .      in the following we consider the ratio of silica mole fractions , @xmath55 varying between @xmath56 ( no hydrates at time @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 ( complete hydration at time @xmath59 ) .",

    "the inversed role of hydration products during the accelerated and deaccelerated periods appears to be experimentally evident from the foregoing considerations .",
    "a widespread assertion in cement literature is that ` early ' hydration is controlled by chemical kinetics whilst ` late ' stage kinetics is being diffusion controlled .",
    "we agree with the later assumption that ion diffusion most probably represents the rate controlling step within the deacceleration period .",

    "the early nucleation period is not accessible employing the here considered experimental techniques , so there is no conflict in interpretation .",
    "one just has to keep in mind that all experimental data points as well as the thereof extracted power  laws are beyond the nucleation period .",
    "after the first few minutes of bringing cement and water into contact , the ions in solution rise their concentrations far beyond the equilibrium solubilities , without precipitating at all .",
    "this can be understood by viewing the process of heterogeneous nucleation as overcoming a thermodynamical barrier ( supersolubility @xcite ) .",
    "being supersaturated the hydrate nucleation happens on the cement grain surfaces @xcite . at this instant a more or less significant part of the solution is strongly oversaturated with respect to the equilibrium solubility . the further precipitation ( growth ) of the hydrates",
    "can thus be regarded to happen approximately within a spatial uniform oversaturated solution ( oversaturated interface layer ) .",
    "this is in so far of concern as the uniformity of ` initial conditions ' is crucial to predict kinetic exponents for diffusion controlled reactions .",

    "it has been also reported that the precipitated microstructure morphologies are strongly influenced by the available interparticle spacings@xcite .",
    "there is presently no straightforward way to predict / calculate microstructural morphologies for such complex systems , however , recently developed heterogeneous reaction - diffusion models have received considerable interest in this context@xcite .",
    "the growth of a precipitate is kinematically very complex .",
    "the precipitated geometry ( microstructure ) can not be predescribed in general beyond the initial conditions but is rather a _ result _ of the associated interface dynamics .",
    "the most simplest case is governed by the growth of spherical precipitates of radius @xmath119 from an initially supersaturated solution of concentration @xmath120 .",

    "one has from continuity of mass , @xmath125 this is the equation of motion for the interface ( in spherical co  ordinates ) .",
    "it establishes the direct proportionality between _ local _ growth rate and particle current density at the interface . in general",
    "@xmath126 depends , as a consequence of interfacial tension , on the ( local ) interface curvature . if the precipitate is not too small one often assumes the zero curvature limit , i.e. , @xmath127 .",
    "the most interesting point in eq .",
    "( [ boundaryequation ] ) is that the gradient of @xmath128 contains ` global information ' about the interface because @xmath129 is the solution of the ( stationary ) diffusion equation , @xmath130 obtained under boundary conditions @xmath131 and @xmath132 . the solution of eqs .",

    "[ fig1 ] .    what causes the observed slowing down of the hydration process ?",
    "if a single foil would precipitate in a spatially infinite supersaturated solution there would be no obvious reason for a slowing down of the hydration process as there exists no characteristic length scale .",
    "however , the here considered case of cement paste is an assembly of small anhydrous cement grains immersed in water .",
    "the mean free distance between particles has to be considered as a typical length scale for the transport and for the precipitation process ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "the size of the growing flakes _ can not _",
    "exceed this because of spatial hindrance .",
    "hence there must exist a typical time scale @xmath70 at which the flakes change their mode of growth into thickening only .",
    "we interpret this typical time as the crossover time @xmath6 observed in fig .",
    "growth of flakes in the thickening only mode is expected to happen parabolically in time for diffusion limited precipitation reactions@xcite .",
