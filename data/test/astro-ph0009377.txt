    "intermediate scale disk galaxies with starbursts are relatively common in the nearby universe .",
    "about 5% of galaxies with @xmath017 @xmath1 m@xmath2 @xmath321 have evidence for starbursts .",
    "many of these occur in smaller galaxies , produce blue colors and strong emission lines , and are in gas rich systems , as indicated by their relatively large fractional hi content .",
    "the more luminous nearby blue starbursts structurally and spectroscopically resemble the faint blue compact narrow emission line galaxies ( cnelgs ) , which become common at redshifts of z@xmath40.3 ( e.g. , guzman et al .",
    "they are less well - matched to high redshift blue galaxies , which have a combination of high uv luminosities and huge star formation rates that are not common in nearby extreme starbursts .",
    "this difference probably reflects secular evolution in the lives of galaxies ; for example , systems at high redshift may be subject to frequent , strong mergers that trigger hyperactive star formation ( e.g. conselice et al .",
    "2001 in prep ) .",
    "nearby starbursts frequently show evidence for being dynamically cool , that is they contain strong spiral arms or bars , features that are found in rotationally supported galactic disks .",
    "thus the processes that produced these starburst did not severely disrupt the disk , or the disk reformed during the starburst event .",
    "local analogs to the cnelgs include profound starbursts arising from minor perturbations ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "moderate interactions ( glancing collisions between equals , minor mergers ) are apparently the sources of many starbursts . evidence for this includes subtle optical structural features such as wisps , faint tails , or moderately disturbed kinematics in starbursts , as well as the more ubiquitous signatures of disturbed hi .",
    "furthermore , in some starbursts where an interaction is the likely trigger , the outer regions of the optical disk appear to be relatively symmetric and relaxed .",
    "three possible explanations for this behavior are :            @xmath5 blue starbursts are commonly associated with disk galaxies : near face - on systems can transmit uv light through areas where the disk has been cleaned out by supershells , supernova , etc .",

    "@xmath5 undisturbed intermediate mass galaxies , such as extreme late - type and superthin spirals ( e.g. , matthews et al .",
    "1998 ) can be inefficient star - formers and thereby store interstellar gas , the fuel for starbursts , over cosmic time scales .",
    "@xmath5 uv - bright regions of starbursts frequently occur in features associated with disks , such as rings or arms ( e.g. conselice et al .",
