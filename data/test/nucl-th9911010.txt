    "nucleon removal reactions play a central role in clarifying important aspects of the nature of nuclear states , particularly those related to the shell structure of nuclei",
    ". there is currently renewed interest in these reactions when the probe is electromagnetic as more sophisticated electron beam machines are now available .",
    "the new generation of possible experiments opens the door to more precise and elaborate data that will help us understand the intricacies of the reaction mechanism and look at possible changes in the structure of nucleons and other hadrons as they move within the nuclear environment .",
    "spin dependent observables are expected to play a key role in these investigations .",
    "most earlier analyses of reactions such as the quasielastic @xmath1 and @xmath0 reactions have been carried out using the non - relativistic distorted wave impulse approximation ( nrdwia ) @xcite . in this approach",
    "the nucleon wave functions needed for the calculation of the reaction amplitude are solutions of the schrdinger equation , and the current operators are obtained from the free probe - nucleon relativistic amplitude via some non - relativistic reduction scheme @xcite .",
    "recently however it has become clear that a fully relativistic approach to the description of these reactions is more appropriate @xcite .",
    "this is evidenced by the improvement in the values of the spectroscopic factors obtained using this approach and indications of improvements to recoil polarization @xcite as well as cross sections at large missing momenta @xcite .    because of the expectation that more precise and expanded data will become available shortly , there has been concentrated activity aimed at discerning details of the theoretical calculations of the amplitudes .",
    "the interplay between relativistic and non - relativistic approaches has been studied by several authors , and recently aspects of gauge dependence as well as coupling effects have been investigated @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to address one detail of the calculations of the amplitudes which is usually overlooked : namely , both relativistic and non - relativistic dwia versions of the amplitude for a variety of reactions , including @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( which are the focus of the present study ) suffer from an orthogonality defect .",
    "these distorted wave models utilize wave functions for bound and continuum states , which are solutions of equations containing different hamiltonians ; the bound states are generated from real potentials , while the continuum states are generated from complex energy dependent optical potentials .",
    "the character of the latter potentials is dictated by the need to account for nucleon elastic scattering observables .",
    "the wave functions are therefore not orthogonal , in contradiction to what a fundamental theory would require .",
    "the impact of the nonorthogonality defect has been discussed in the past and ways to remedy it have been suggested @xcite .",
    "the majority of these discussions were done in a non - relativistic framework but many of the remedies suggested have never been utilized in main stream calculations .",
    "noble @xcite attempted to recast the amplitude for photoabsorption into a form that takes into account the orthogonality of the nucleon wave functions .",
    "difficulties with this approach have been discussed by eisenberg , noble and weber @xcite .",
    "celenza and shakin @xcite suggested that a modified hamiltonian for the continuum states can be constructed in such a manner as to guarantee both orthogonality with the bound states , and a fit to the proton elastic scattering data .",
    "this proposition was never tested in practice .",
    "other possibilities discussed by boffi _",
    "_ @xcite involved the introduction of effective operators , but it turned out that these were too difficult to calculate .",
    "for the two reactions under consideration , however , a more practical approach was identified and used to assess the role of non - orthogonality on the non - relativistic amplitudes . it was suggested by boffi _",

    "we give a brief outline of the relativistic calculations for nucleon knockout induced by the quasi elastic scattering of electrons or the absorption of real photons .",
    "we then introduce the method of orthogonalization of the nucleon wave functions and calculate the resulting corrections to the reaction amplitude .",

    "the cross sections ( part ( a ) of the figures ) are affected only slightly at most angles but the deviations can be large at extreme backward angles .",
    "the relative increase of the effect at large angles is a reflection of the fact , mentioned above , that the orthogonality requirement modifies only low partial waves .",
    "the effects on proton polarization ( part ( b ) ) and photon asymmetry ( part ( c ) ) are noticeable over most of the angular range , but are small at the very forward angles .",

    "boffi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite argued that the effect of non - orthogonality on the unfactorized @xmath0 cross sections vanishes because of the transverse nature of the electromagnetic current .",

    "the reason for the difference is that in eq .",
    "( [ orthog_cont ] ) , even if one restricts the sum to a single orbital ( @xmath39 ) there are still contributions from different magnetic substates . as a result some of the contributions from orthogonalization do not vanish .",
    "this difference can be stated as due to the possibility of spin - flip in the outgoing channel ( which is closely linked to the presence of the spin - orbit interaction ) ; such a possibility was not taken into account by boffi _",

    "it should be noted that one important shortcoming of this procedure is that the new distorted wave function is no longer able to reproduce the elastic scattering data .",

    "we have used a gram - schmidt procedure @xcite to orthogonalize the continuum and bound - state wave functions of the nucleon .",
    "this procedure , besides being closely linked to the antisymmetrization @xcite of the final state wave function , also has the merit of leaving the continuum wave function asymptotically intact .",
    "this ensures that the wave function continues to provide the same good description of the elastic scattering data as the original distorted wave .",
    "calculations were carried out for two schemes , one where orthogonality is imposed only in relation to the specific hole state involved in the reaction , and full orthogonality with all occupied levels .",

    "<S> the continuum wave function describing the outgoing nucleon is made orthogonal to the relevant bound states using the gram - schmidt procedure . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure has the advantage of preserving the asymptotic character of the continuum wave function and hence the elastic observables are unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> the orthogonality effects are found to be negligible for @xmath1 reactions for missing momenta up to 700 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this holds true for both parallel and perpendicular kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast the orthogonalization of the wave functions appears to have a more pronounced effect in the case of @xmath0 reactions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the orthogonality effect can be significant in this case particularly for large angles . </S>",
    "<S> polarization of the outgoing protons and photon asymmetry show more sensitivity than the cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> if the orthogonality condition is imposed solely on this one hole state the effects are usually smaller . </S>"
