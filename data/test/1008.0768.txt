    "confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are the most fundamental properties of strong interaction physics at low temperature and density , where the physics is mainly governed by the non - perturbative qcd . in principle , the deconfinement phase transition and chiral phase transition are defined in two extreme limits of current quark mass .",
    "deconfinement phase transition and its order parameter is well defined for infinite current quark mass and chiral phase transition is exact for zero quark mass .",
    "but in real world with a finite value of quark masses , the nature of these two phase transitions is an open question .",
    "another important feature of the qcd phase diagram is the existence of the critical end point ( cep ) , where first order phase transition , from hadronic phase to quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) phase , ends .",
    "however , the exact location of cep is still unknown .",
    "investigation of these properties of strongly interacting matter are necessary to understand the various astrophysical and cosmological scenario .",
    "the experimental explorations to understand the properties of strongly interacting matter has been studied at relativistic heavy - ion - collider ( rhic ) , brookhaven @xcite where the heavy nuclei collide with each other at relativistic energies to form hot and dense strongly interacting matter .",
    "more data are expected from lhc and fair in future . but to analyze the data from the experiment , we need a thorough understanding of the theory of strong interaction physics .    due to our limited knowledge of the non - perturbative physics , qcd , which is the theory of strong interaction , can not be used to study the phase transition picture . in this regard lattice qcd ( lqcd )",
    "provides the most direct approach to study qcd at high temperature @xcite",
    ". however lqcd has its own restrictions due to the discretization of space - time .",
    "furthermore , at finite chemical potential , lqcd faces the well known sign problem .",
    "another approach to study low energy limit of qcd and the qcd phase transition is to use effective theories of qcd .",
    "polyakov loop extended nambu  jona - lasinio model ( pnjl ) is one of the successful approach which combines the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking properties in a simple formalism . there have been series of work to study the thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter using pnjl model for both 2 flavor and 2 + 1 flavor @xcite .",
    "these studies suggest that this model reproduces the zero density lattice data quite successfully",
    ". however , the vacuum of the njl part of the pnjl model seems to to be unbound in a 2 + 1 flavor scenario .",
    "a plausible solution of this problem has been proposed by osipov _",
    "_ using eight - quark interaction term @xcite . also the 2 flavor pnjl model have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with eight - quark interaction . in our previous work",
    ", we developed 2 + 1 flavor pnjl model with eight - quark interaction terms in the lagrangian with three - momentum cutoff regularisation @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic aspect of the phase transition from hadronic phase to qgp phase can be understood properly if we study the thermodynamic variables like quark number susceptibility ( qns ) , isospin number susceptibility ( ins ) , specific heat @xmath0 and speed of sound ( @xmath1 ) etc .",
    "susceptibilities are related to fluctuations via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "a measure of the intrinsic statistical fluctuations in a system close to thermal equilibrium is provided by the corresponding susceptibilities . at zero chemical potential ,",
    "charge fluctuations are sensitive indicators of the transition from hadronic matter to qgp .",
    "also the existence of the cep can be signalled by the divergent fluctuations .",
    "for the small net baryon number , which can be met at different experiments , the transition from hadronic to qgp phase is continuous and the fluctuations are not expected to lead any singular behavior .",
    "recently , the computations on the lattice have been performed for many of these susceptibilities at zero chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "it was shown that at vanishing chemical potential the susceptibilities rise rapidly around the continuous crossover transition region .",
    "the study of higher order moments of fluctuations are also necessary to locate the transition point more accurately . in 2 flavor qcd",
    ", it has been shown that the quark number and isospin number fluctuations increase with temperature and their fourth moments start to show pronounced peaks in the transition region from low to high temperature @xcite .",
    "in fact the higher order coefficients become increasingly sensitive in the vicinity of phase transition .",
    "fluctuations are computed with respect to the quark chemical potential in 2 flavor pnjl model with three - momentum cutoff regularisation @xcite .",
    "also qns at finite density has been estimated in some works within 2 flavor pnjl model @xcite .",
    "recently the idea of the taylor expansion in terms of chemical potential for pnjl model has been computed within the constraint that the net strange quark density is zero , which is the case in ultra relativistic heavy ion collision @xcite .",
    "there have been recent calculations towards the fluctuations in 2 + 1 flavor lattice qcd @xcite and also in the 2 + 1 flavor pnjl model taking upto six - quark determinant interaction terms @xcite .",
    "similar calculations have been carried out in polyakov loop coupled quark - meson ( pqm ) model @xcite and its renormalization group improved version @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the susceptibilities within 2 + 1 flavor pnjl model framework with two different kinds of njl interaction . in one case",
    "we take the conventional form which takes into account upto six - quark determinant interaction , which we will call as model a. in the other case an extra eight - quark interaction term is added to make the effective potential bound , which will be hereafter denoted by model b. we have also studied the specific heat and the speed of sound .",
    "specific heat is related to the event - by - event temperature fluctuations @xcite and mean transverse momentum fluctuations @xcite in heavy - ion reactions .",
    "these fluctuations show diverging behavior near the critical end point ( cep ) .",
    "the speed of sound determines the flow properties in heavy - ion reactions @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , the basic formalism of the pnjl model and also the calculation of fluctuations have been discussed .",
    "various thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat , speed of sound are also defined in this section . in the next section",
