    "the presence of a surface is well known to change locally the critical properties at an equilibrium critical point @xcite . at the so - called ordinary transition , where only the bulk correlation length diverges ,",
    "this breaking of spatial translation invariance yields a surface universality class characterized by a set of critical exponents that differ from the corresponding bulk critical exponents .",
    "this change of local critical exponents due to the presence of a surface is not restricted to equilibrium phase transitions , but has recently also been revealed at a dynamic phase transition @xcite .",
    "in addition , enhanced surface couplings in three - dimensional systems may result in a variety of surface phase transitions . whereas at the special point both the bulk and the surface are critical , at the so - called surface transition only the surface orders whereas the bulk remains disordered .",
    "finally , at the extraordinary transition the bulk orders in presence of an ordered surface .",
    "additional phenomena , as for example critical wetting , are encountered when external fields are applied @xcite .    a special kind of surface critical phenomenon can be encountered in situations where the bulk undergoes a first - order phase transition @xcite . due to surface induced disordering the surface order parameter may go continuously to zero when one approaches the bulk transition temperature from below , i.e. one has a first - order transition in the bulk but a second - order transition at the surface .",
    "this surface critical behavior , which is coupled to an interface delocalization phenomenon , is characterized by a set of surface critical exponents .",
    "this general scenario has been verified for a range of systems as for example an effective interface model @xcite , face - centered - cubic ising antiferromagnets @xcite , body - centered - cubic alloys @xcite or two - dimensional potts models undergoing a discontinuous bulk phase transition @xcite .",
    "related surface ( or , more appropriately , interface ) phenomena are also encountered in non - equilibrium situations where magnetic systems are sheared or magnetic blocks are moved passed each other , thereby giving rise to magnetic friction @xcite . when the involved bulk systems have an equilibrium first - order transition , as it is the case for two - dimensional and three - dimensional potts system with a large number of states , non - equilibrium surface transitions of different types ( continuous , discontinuous , tricritical ) emerge @xcite .",
    "early on , the values of the different local exponents at surface induced disordering were determined within landau theory @xcite .",
    "surface exponents were also determined in an effective interface model that incorporates fluctuations by expanding around the mean - field solution @xcite . however , until now only very few attempts have been made to compute for specific systems the surface critical exponents at a discontinuous bulk transition .",
    "for instance , in numerical simulations of both face - centered - cubic @xcite and body - centered - cubic @xcite alloys nonuniversal exponents were observed at surface induced disordering . in a study @xcite of the two - dimensional potts model , which undergoes a first - order phase transition",
    "when the number of states @xmath0 is larger than four , the surface exponents were computed exactly in the @xmath1 limit .",
    "in addition , systems with @xmath2 , 8 , or 9 states were studied numerically for small stripes with mixed boundary conditions using dmrg . extrapolating to infinity the data obtained for stripes with width less than 40 rows , it was concluded that the corresponding surface exponents were universal and identical to those of the @xmath1 case .    in this paper",
    "we are revisiting surface induced disordering in the two - dimensional potts model . using extensive numerical simulations",
    ", we study large systems with up to @xmath3 states .",
    "our numerical data for a variety of quantities and boundary conditions show in a consistent way that the surface exponents at the bulk first - order transition depend on the number of states . therefore , while the general scenario of surface induced disordering is correct , the phenomenon does not yield universal surface exponents , but instead the values of these exponents are nonuniversal and depend on microscopic details like the number of states .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way .",
    "we introduce the model and the quantities of interest in the next section , before briefly reviewing in section iii some of the general results obtained for surface induced disordering , as far as they are relevant for our study . in section",
    "iv we present our numerical results and obtain the values of different surface exponents .",
    "as we show , the different quantities yield a consistent picture indicating that the surface exponents at the first - order transition in the two - dimensional potts model depend on the number of states and are therefore not universal . finally , in section iv we discuss our results and conclude .",
    "in the following we study the ordering of the two - dimensional potts model in presence of a surface , characterized by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the kronecker delta , with @xmath6 if @xmath7 and @xmath8 otherwise . in this hamiltonian",
    "the first term describes the interaction between nearest neighbor potts spins where at least one of them does not belong to the surface , whereas the second term is the interaction between nearest neighbor spins that are both located at the surface row @xmath9 .",
    "the ferromagnetic bulk and surface coupling constants are given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 . throughout this study",
    "we only consider the case @xmath12 .",
    "temperatures are measured in units such that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "our focus is on cases where the bulk transition is of first order @xcite .",
    "for that reason we consider at every lattice site @xmath15 a potts spin @xmath16 that can take on @xmath0 values , @xmath17 , with @xmath18 .",
    "we thereby probe a wide range of @xmath0 values , namely @xmath19 , 9 , 16 , and 100 .",
    "we consider systems composed of @xmath20 spins , where the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 used in our study will be discussed below .",
    "we always consider periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath23-direction .",
    "most of our quantities are obtained for free boundaries in the @xmath24-direction , yielding systems with two surfaces located at @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in order to make a connection with the data discussed in @xcite",
    ", we also investigate some systems with symmetry - breaking boundary conditions where the spins along one of the surfaces are at a fixed common value .    due to the presence of surfaces , local quantities depend on the row index @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "our quantities of interest include the local magnetization , @xmath27 , the surface excess magnetization , @xmath28 , as well as the spin - spin correlations along and perpendicular to the surface , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , where the index @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) indicates a surface ( bulk ) spin .",
    "the magnetization of row @xmath24 is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the average number of majority spins in that row : @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being the average number of spins in state @xmath37 in row @xmath24 .",
    "the surface magnetization @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 ( which equals @xmath40 in the case of free boundary conditions ) . from the magnetization profile",
    "we can derive the so - called surface excess magnetization associated with the surface located at @xmath25 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the bulk magnetization . when approaching the @xmath0-dependent bulk transition temperature @xmath43 from below , both the surface magnetization and the surface excess magnetization are displaying close to @xmath44 an algebraic behavior as a function of temperature @xcite : @xmath45^{\\beta_1 } \\\\",

    "our aim in the following is to obtain values for the critical exponents @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 as a function of the number of states @xmath0 . in order to do",
    "so we combine two complementary approaches . in the first approach",
    "we determine our quantities as a function of temperature and calculate from these data effective exponents that yield the critical exponents in the limit @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "for example , for the surface magnetization @xmath38 we obtain the effective surface exponent via the logarithmic derivative @xmath55 with the reduced temperature @xmath56 .",
    "we then have @xmath57 for this approach only data not affected by finite - size effects should be used , which requires the comparison of systems of different sizes .",
    "for that reason we study large ranges of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , ranging from @xmath58 to @xmath59 and from @xmath60 to @xmath61 . in the second approach",
    "we try to use finite - size effects to our advantage .",
    "following @xcite , we consider the surface magnetization at the exactly known bulk transition temperature @xmath44 , using symmetry - breaking boundary conditions . for a system with @xmath62 and width @xmath22 , the surface magnetization",
    "should then depend algebraically on the scaling dimension @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 . in order to mimic a stripe of infinite length we study systems with @xmath21 up to @xmath65 . as a drawback",
    ", only stripes with rather small widths @xmath22 can be simulated .",
    "still , comparing our estimates for the scaling dimension with the independently determined values of @xmath46 and @xmath49 using temperature - dependent quantities provides us with an important check whether our different data sets are consistent .",
    "when the bulk undergoes a continuous phase transition , as it is for example the case for the ising model , then the surface critical exponents and the relationship between these exponents can be derived from the scaling form of the singular part of the surface free energy @xcite . as shown in @xcite a similar phenomenology holds in the case of surface induced disordering .",
    "indeed , as function of the two scaling fields @xmath66 ( the reduced temperature ) and @xmath67 ( a surface field ) , the singular part of the surface free energy may be written as @xcite @xmath68 with the two independent surface exponents @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "all surface critical exponents can then be expressed through these two independent exponents .",
    "specifically for some of the exponents at the center of our study one obtains @xcite : @xmath71 combining equations ( [ exp2 ] ) and ( [ exp3 ] ) yields for two - dimensional systems with @xmath72 the relationship @xmath73 which provides an additional check for the consistency of our data .",
