    "fifteen years ago , hutsemkers discovered that the optical polarisation vectors from distant quasars are not randomly distributed @xcite .",
    "the original study considered a sample of 170 quasars , and the probability of a random distribution was 0.5 % . since then",
    ", further measurements have been added @xcite , and the significance of the effect has grown : with the present sample of 355 polarisation data points , the alignment effect has been estimated to have a probability to be random lower than 0.1 % in some regions of the sky defined by cuts on right ascension and redshift .",
    "the original test however had a weak point , as the angles of the polarisation vectors are measured with respect to their local meridian .",
    "therefore , the strength of the alignment , and the significance of the effect , depend on the choice of the spherical coordinate system , so that it is possible to find an axis for which the effect becomes negligible , i.e. for which the data look random . indeed , the original statistical tests do not take into account the fact that polarisation vectors come from different lines of sight and thus are not defined in the same plane . to remedy this problem ,",
    "@xcite have proposed to parallel - transport the polarisation vectors along geodesics of the celestial sphere onto one point in order to compare them .",
    "while the distribution of polarisation angles still depends on the point where it is built , it does not depend on the coordinates , and one can build robust statistical tests ( see jain et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and hutsemkers et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ) .",
    "unfortunately , these tests have to resort to the generation of a large number of random data in order to determine the significance of the signal and do not lead to a clear characterization of the effect .",
    "furthermore , to make an intrinsic test , polarisation vectors must be transported to the location of the quasars . however",
    ", this is an arbitrary choice as they can be transported to any point on the celestial sphere .",
    "the sum of the parallel - transported polarisation vectors then makes a continuous axial vector field on the sphere , and by the hairy ball theorem @xcite , it is still possible to find at least two points where the effect vanishes .",
    "hence the quantification of the size of the effect seems uncertain again .",
    "we propose here another method which is totally independent of the coordinate system , and which quantifies unambiguously the alignment effect .",
    "it allows us to compare the polarisation vectors of sources located at different angular coordinates and leads to the characterization of the effect through a blind analysis of the data .",
    "the basic idea is to consider the physical polarisation vectors as 3-dimensional objects rather than 2-dimensional ones embedded in their polarisation plane .",
    "these 3-dimensional objects are the directions of the electric field oscillations and they are the physical objects which are measured . as we are dealing with a number of vectors , it is clear that it will be possible to define preferred directions .",
    "we can also use the same method to study the dependence on redshift , position in the sky or degree of linear polarisation by imposing cuts on these variables and repeating the study for the corresponding sub - sample .",
    "we devote the present paper to the construction of this new statistical method applied here to the analysis of quasar polarisation data , in which the evaluation of the significance of the signal will be largely analytic .",
    "the second section of this paper explains the details of our statistical method .",
    "it also contains illustrations and discussions related to the statistical background , when polarisation angles are assumed to be uniformly distributed , and is compared with the original study of @xcite using the same cuts .",
    "the third section is devoted to the application of this new statistical method first globally , then to slices in redshift .",
    "we also consider there the dependence of the alignment on the various parameters , the possibility of a cosmological alignment , and define our final most significant regions exhibiting an anomalous alignment of polarisation vectors .",
    "when an electromagnetic wave is partially or fully linearly polarized , a polarisation vector is introduced .",
    "its norm reflects the degree of linear polarisation of the radiation while its direction is that of the oscillating electric field .",
    "this vector is thus embedded into the plane orthogonal to the radiation direction of propagation , the polarisation plane .",
    "since the electric field is oscillating , the polarisation vector is an axial quantity , rather than a true vector , so that the polarisation angle is determined up to @xmath2 radians .",
    "we consider sources as being points on the unit celestial sphere and we choose a spherical polar coordinate system defined by the orthonormal 3-vectors @xmath3 , with @xmath4 pointing to the south pole . in the following bold - faced letters indicate 3-vectors .",
    "polarisation vectors are tangent to this unit sphere . for a given source in the direction @xmath5",
    ", a polarisation vector must lie in the plane defined by the two unit vectors @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "we choose the angle @xmath7 between the polarisation vector @xmath8 and the basis vector @xmath6 , defined in the range @xmath9 , to be the polarisation angle .",
    "the normalized polarisation vector can then be written @xmath10 each measurement @xmath11 of the dataset @xcite is equivalent to a position 3-vector @xmath12associated with a normalised polarisation direction @xmath13 and polarisation magnitude @xmath14 .",
    "contrarily to the various angles , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are physical , @xmath15 they do not depend on the choice of coordinates .",
    "as we are interested in polarisation alignments , we shall consider mostly the @xmath13 in the following .",
    "the problem is then as follows : we have a number of normalised vectors , and we want to decide if they are abnormally aligned .",
    "we can draw them from the same origin , and their ends , which we shall call the polarisation points , have to lie on a unit 2-sphere , which we shall refer to as the polarisation sphere .",
    "the problem is that , even when the polarisation angles @xmath7 are uniformly distributed , the polarisation sphere is not uniformly covered by the points : they have to lie on great circles on the 2-sphere .",
    "indeed , for each source , the polarisation vectors are constrained to be in the plane defined by the basis vectors @xmath16 .",
    "the intersection of the plane with the polarisation sphere is a great circle , which is the geometric locus where the polarisation vector attached to the source @xmath11 may intersect the sphere , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2qexample ] .",
    "note that the figure is symmetric as polarisation vectors are defined up to a sign . in the following ,",
    "we choose to show the full sphere , although a half - sphere could be used to represent the polarisation space .    to compare the observations with what one would expect if the polarisation points were drawn from a random distribution of polarisation angles , we need to select a region on the polarisation sphere , count the number of polarisation points within this region , and compare this number with the prediction .",
    "one could do this by monte - carlo techniques , but as we shall see the probabilities turn out to be rather low , so that a detailed study would prove difficult .",
    "however , we found that a particular choice of shape for the region on the sphere considerably simplifies the evaluation of probabilities .",
    "we consider cones in which the polarisation vectors fall , or equivalently spherical caps of fixed aperture angle .",
    "the probability distribution of a given number of points in a given spherical cap can be computed analytically as explained below .",
    "a scan of the whole polarisation half - sphere leads to a map of expected densities which constitutes the statistical background . at any location on the half - sphere , the hypothesis of uniformity",
    "can then be tested by calculating the probability of the observed number of polarisation points .",
    "an alignment of polarisation vectors from different sources will be detected when an over - density between data points and the background is significant .",
    "as mentioned above , the locus of the polarisation points is a half - circle in the plane normal to the source position vector .",
    "the probability that a polarisation point lies inside a spherical cap is then given by the length of the arc of circle intercepted by the cap , divided by the whole length of the half - circle ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "let @xmath17 being the half - aperture angle of the spherical cap , and @xmath18 the unit vector pointing to its centre .",
    "if @xmath13 is a normalised polarisation vector attached to the source @xmath11 , with position vector @xmath12 , the corresponding polarisation point lies inside the spherical cap centred at @xmath18 if and only if    @xmath19    is verified . adopting the decomposition of @xmath13 along two vectors in the polarisation plane @xmath20 where @xmath21 , a straightforward calculation involving the normalisation of @xmath13 and the condition for being inside the spherical cap leads to the arc length @xmath22 of the geometric locus lying inside the considered area .",
    "the result takes a simple form in terms of @xmath23 , the angle between @xmath12 and @xmath18 : condition ( [ eq:1b ] ) becomes @xmath24 and , by integration of the line element , the arc length within the cap is found to be : @xmath25    therefore , the probability @xmath26 that the _ i_-th source of the sample leads to a polarisation point inside a given spherical cap is : @xmath27 hence , these probabilities only depend on the chosen aperture angle of the spherical cap and on the angle between the source positions and the cap centre .",
    "these probabilities are thus completely independent of the system of coordinates .",
    "for each cap , the set of probabilities @xmath26 leads to the construction of the probability distribution @xmath28 of observing exactly @xmath29 points of polarisation inside the spherical cap .",
    "if @xmath30 is the sample size we have : @xmath31 note that following the previous definitions , it is possible to write , for each @xmath29 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the probability to observe @xmath34 points of polarisation ( and only @xmath34 ) after the _ j_-th element is removed from the original sample , making the new sample size @xmath35 .      starting with the entire sample of size @xmath30 ,",
    "let us consider the probability @xmath36 to observe no polarisation point within the cap .",
    "we remove the _",
    "k_-th element from this sample .",
    "then , from , the probability to observe no polarisation point within this reduced sample , denoted by @xmath37 , is related to @xmath36 through @xmath38 , where we introduced the following notation for the probability that the source _",
    "@xmath39 _ does not lead to a polarisation point in the concerned area : @xmath40 .",
    "first consider the probability @xmath41 to observe one and only one polarisation point : @xmath42 a similar calculation leads to @xmath43 .",
    "one can prove by induction that the following relation holds : @xmath44 indeed , assuming the relation is true for @xmath45 , it is easy to show that it is then true for @xmath46 : @xmath47 \\right ) \\nonumber\\\\   & & + { \\ell}{(k)}\\,\\frac{1}{n}\\,p_{n-1}{}_{\\backslash k}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & { \\rlap{\\large /}{\\ell}}^{(k)}\\ , p_{n}{}_{\\backslash k}+{\\ell}^{(k)}\\ , p_{n-1}{}_{\\backslash k}\\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , holds ) was first introduced by howard ( 1972 ) and its numerical behaviour was extensively discussed in the paper @xcite about computational techniques for the poisson - binomial probabilities .",
    "the algorithm presented here is equivalent to that given in @xcite . ] for every @xmath48 .",
    "assuming that , for a sample of size @xmath30 and for a given spherical cap , we have all elementary probabilities @xmath26 , we use the following algorithm for numerically computing the probability distribution :    \\1 ) we introduce a column vector @xmath49 of size @xmath50 , initialized to zero , except for @xmath51 which is set to 1 .",

    "\\3 ) after @xmath30 iterations , the @xmath52 give the @xmath28 distribution for the studied sample distributions , and found a perfect agreement .",
    "we checked that the same conclusions are obtained for the whole sample of quasars presented in @xcite and for arbitrary sub - samples . ] .      to illustrate the use of the above",

    "we have presented in this paper a new coordinate - invariant method to detect polarisation alignments in sparse data , and applied it to the case of alignments of optical polarisation vectors from quasars .",
    "we showed that we automatically recover regions previously found , and we refined their limits based on objective criteria ( see table  [ tab : best ] ) .",
    "as a byproduct , the directions of alignments in space are unambiguously determined .",
    "the method we propose is powerful , as the coordinate - invariant significance levels are semi - analytically determined .",
    "the remaining drawback is that the determination of the global significance levels relies on very time - consuming monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we believe that this new analysis puts the alignment effect on stronger grounds as the global significance level is as low as @xmath1 for some regions of redshift .    however , one has to note that the significance levels obtained in this papers and those reported in @xcite are not in full agreement .",
    "indeed , the z - type tests used in @xcite and @xcite reshuffle the measured polarisation directions while keeping the source locations to evaluate the background .",
    "the advantage is that any systematic effect vanishes automatically through this method .",
    "the disadvantage is that it washes out global effects , or alignments present for a large number of quasars .",
    "random generation of polarisation angles , as used here or in @xcite , has the opposite features : we can detect global alignments , but we are sensitive to systematic effects . hence the two methods do not need to be in full agreement .",
    "one should note , however , that the sample of optical polarisation measurements of quasars considered here comes from many independent observational campaigns , so that a common bias is unlikely ( see @xcite and @xcite for discussion ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have addressed this question of global systematic effect with the sample of 213 quasar polarisation measurements available at the time by comparing analyses of z - type tests using uniform polarisation angle distribution and distribution made by reshuffling .",
    "they found that the significance level could decrease by factors of the order three .",
    "we expect this to be the case in this study .",
    "note that this uncertainty is of the same order as that we estimated using the jackknife algorithm .",
    "applying our method to the sample of 355 quasars compiled in @xcite , we identified the following main features .",
    "the directions of alignments show a dependence on the redshift of the sources .",
    "although this dependence seems discontinuous , one should note that we detected significant alignments for redshift intervals where the distribution of data peaks .",
    "thus , more data in regions of redshift with poor statistics are required in order to study this dependence in more details . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : finestruct ] , for a given redshift interval , alignment seems to be mainly due to quasars well localized toward specific directions of the sky .",
    "furthermore , no strong evidence has been found for a dependence on the degree of linear polarisation .    as a result of the application of our new method to the present sample of optical polarisation measurements of quasars , and in agreement with @xcite , we found several distinct sub - samples of sources well localized in redshift and position on the sky that show unexpected alignments of their polarisation vectors .",
    "we established two regions towards the north galactic pole , one at low and the other at high redshift , and only one towards the south galactic pole at intermediate redshift , which possibly dominates the whole southern sky .",
    "besides the regions previously detected , or their improved version , we also showed that there exists the possibility of a cosmological alignment .",
