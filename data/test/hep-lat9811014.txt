    "the fermion determinant is a highly non - local object as can e.g.  be seen from the hopping expansion for lattice regularized fermions ( see @xcite for a basic introduction ) .",
    "the hopping expansion expresses the fermion determinant as the exponential of a sum over all possible closed loops and the external field variables along a loop are collected as factors for this loop .",
    "the exponential function can then be expanded and the result is a representation of the fermion determinant in terms of loops . the loop - sum in the exponent , however , contains loops of arbitrary length , which can also iterate parts or all of their contour arbitrarily often .",
    "thus , the exponent contains arbitrarily high powers of the external fields . on the other hand we know that , at least on a finite lattice , the fermion determinant is a finite polynomial in the external fields , and thus infinitely many contributions present in the exponent have to cancel each other when expanding the exponential .",
    "the result has to be a relatively simple loop representation for the fermion determinant .    for the case of staggered fermions",
    "several papers can be found in the literature @xcite-@xcite where polymer representations for the fermions are obtained .",
    "for the case of wilson fermions relatively few is known due to the more involved spinor structure of the fermions . here",
    "we concentrate on 2-d wilson fermions .",
    "an instance where the above discussed cancellation of contributions was brought under control for a model with wilson fermions is salmhofer s mapping of the strongly coupled lattice schwinger model to a self avoiding loop model @xcite . in a first step the gauge fields at strong ( = infinite ) coupling were integrated out and the remaining grassmann integral was then represented as a sum over loops .",
    "subsequently scharnhorst studied the two - flavor lattice schwinger model with this method @xcite and extended the techniques to find a two - color loop model for the 2-d lattice thirring model @xcite . in all of these cases , however the external field",
    "was either integrated out in the strong coupling limit @xcite or was nt present at all @xcite . on the other hand , our arguments given in the first paragraph show that the cancellation of higher winding loops is a universal phenomenon and that it should be possible to find a simple loop representation also for the fermion determinant in an external field .    in this article",
    "we present a simple formula for the fermion determinant of 2-d wilson lattice fermions in a scalar background field ( eq .  ( [ equivalence ] ) ) . the proof is based on a result for the hopping expansion for a generalized 8-vertex model where the vertices are coupled to a background field @xcite . with a proper choice of the vertex weights the square of the partition function for this model represents the 2-d fermion determinant in a scalar background field .",
    "the resulting expression reduces the hopping expansion to a finite sum ( on a finite lattice ) of loops .",
    "in addition it is possible to explicitly integrate out the external field . by doing so with a gaussian action for the scalar",
    "we generate a loop representation of the 2-d gross - neveu model .",
    "such loop representations for lattice field theories allow for a considerably more accurate numerical treatment as has e.g.  been demonstrated for the strongly coupled schwinger model @xcite .",
    "the basic idea for the proof of our loop representation is to identify the hopping expansion of the wilson fermion determinant with the hopping expansion of a generalized 8-vertex model @xcite .",
    "here we briefly rederive the hopping expansion for wilson fermions in a form suitable for comparison with the generalized 8-vertex model ( see e.g.  @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the hopping expansion ) .",

    "we define @xmath9 and assume that @xmath2 is such that @xmath10 for all lattice points @xmath11 .",
    "this is a purely technical assumption due to the particular techniques we use for computing the determinant .",
    "the final result will be a finite polynomial in the @xmath2 and the above restriction is irrelevant then .",

    "it first has been solved in @xcite by realizing that the pauli matrices give rise to a representation of discrete rotations on the lattice .",

    "a _ tiling _ of our lattice @xmath7 ( the same rectangular piece of @xmath37 as before ) is a covering of @xmath7 with the tiles such that on each site of @xmath7 we place one of our tiles with the centers of the tiles sitting on the sites .",

    "for all other tiles @xmath11 is counted once and the factor is @xmath35 .",
    "the generalized model ( [ 8vertex ] ) also allows for a hopping expansion which is derived in @xcite .",
    "the central step is to rewrite the partition function as an integral over grassmann variables along the lines of @xcite .",
    "the action is a quadratic form in the grassmann variables and the partition function gives rise to a pfaffian .",
    "the pfaffian however can be expanded similar to the expansion in section 2 and it is furthermore possible to explicitly evaluate the traces over the hopping matrix .",

    "we will work on lattices with an even number of sites and the overall sign factor is 1 .    the exponents @xmath49 in ( [ 8vertexhop ] ) give the numbers for the abundance of the line elements as they are depicted in fig .",

    "the element corresponding to the tile 2 with weight @xmath53 ( compare fig .  [ tiles ] ) is not needed to describe the loop @xmath22 .",
    "equation ( [ 8vertexhop ] ) does not contain @xmath53 explicitly at all .",
    "the weight @xmath53 is related to the other weights through the free fermion condition @xcite @xmath54 the free fermion condition is a sufficient condition for finding an explicit solution to the standard 8-vertex model without external fields .",
    "the above mentioned grassmann representation automatically enforces the free fermion condition as is discussed in more detail in @xmath55 .    by comparing ( [ finalhop ] ) with ( [ 8vertexhop ] )",
    "we find that the sums over the loops in the exponent become identical when setting @xmath56 using the free fermion condition ( [ freecond ] ) we find @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that when representing wilson fermions using eq .",
    "( [ 8vertex ] ) , the sum over the tilings can be replaced by a sum over the set @xmath58 of closed , self - avoiding loops , i.e.  loops that are not allowed to self intersect or touch each other .",
    "the loops can have several disconnected but closed pieces and each piece is included in @xmath58 with only one of its two possible orientations .",
    "it is important to note , that the exponents in ( [ finalhop ] ) and ( [ 8vertexhop ] ) differ by an overall factor of 2 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the action for the wilson fermions is a bilinear form giving rise to a determinant while the grassmann action for ( [ 8vertex ] ) is a quadratic form giving rise to a pfaffian when integrating out the grassmann variables .",
    "since the kernel of the latter action is anti - symmetric the pfaffian , however , is given by the square root of a determinant causing the difference by a factor of 2 in the exponent .    putting things together we",

    "the overall factor , however , still can cancel the quadratic terms and the final result is a finite polynomial in the fields @xmath2 .",
    "the above imposed technical restrictions on the range of @xmath2 can now be lifted .",
    "+ several remarks on the result ( [ equivalence ] ) are in order : when setting all external fields to zero we find that free wilson fermions are equivalent to the square of the partition function of the self avoiding loop model @xcite with bending rigidity @xmath60 and bond weight @xmath61^{-1}$ ] .",
    "thus for a trivial background field we reproduce the result for free fermions obtained by scharnhorst @xcite with a different method .",

    "( [ equivalence ] ) is exactly the expression we had in mind when discussing the general algebraic structure of the determinant . in two dimensions the fermion determinant has to be a polynomial which can at most be quadratic in the external field .",
    "the feature that the terms in this polynomial are organized according to closed loops is inherited from the hopping expansion .",
    "actually , for single contributions to ( [ equivalence ] ) it is even possible to trace their emergence from an expansion of the exponential in ( [ finalhop ] ) .",
    "when doing so , one finds that the intersection factor @xmath62 provides the mechanism which ensures the cancellation of loops with multiply occupied links .",
    "( [ 8vertexhop ] ) establishes that this cancellation mechanism is also independent of the corner weights .",

    "the next candidate are 2-d fermions interacting with an abelian vector field .",
    "the vector field is coupled to the fermions through its gauge transporters which are supported on links instead of sites .",

    "all terms of the hopping expansion can still be evaluated explicitly .",
    "a certain difficulty is , however , given by the fact that the link variables have to be complex conjugated when hopping in backward direction .",
    "thus the loops in the hopping expansion give contributions complex conjugated to each other when the orientation is reversed .",
    "we believe , however , that when properly organizing the loops this problem can be overcome .",

    "the case of non - abelian gauge fields poses the additional difficulty , that due to the traces over the gauge field matrices the product of two loops can not be written as a new loop . nevertheless ,",
