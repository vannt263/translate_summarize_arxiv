    "how to understand the boundary between classical and quantum physics is a long - term open question .",
    "quantum physics differs significantly from classical physics in many aspects .",
    "a complete classical description of an object contains information concerning only compatible properties , while a complete quantum description of an object also contains complementary information concerning incompatible properties ( see fig .",

    "this difference is also present in correlations .",
    "a classical correlation in a bipartite system involves the correlation of only a certain property , while a quantum correlation in a bipartite system also involves complementary correlations of incompatible properties .",

    "of a quantum system ( e.g. a spin-1/2 particle ) contains information about incompatible properties ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) in an intrinsic way : information about incompatible properties exists simultaneously even though only a single property can be measured at a time ; and we can freely select which property to measure.,width=321 ]    more recently , entangled states were defined as states that can not be written as convex sums of product states .",
    "this precise definition is very helpful in terms of both mathematical and physical convenience , and it motivates the useful definition of the entanglement of formation .",
    "however , we now know that entanglement of formation is just one particular aspect of quantum correlation . many measures of quantum correlation have been proposed from different perspectives , and they can be divided into two categories : entanglement measures @xcite , and measures of nonclassical correlation beyond entanglement @xcite .",
    "the essential feature of quantum correlation , i.e. , the simultaneous existence of complementary correlations in different bases , is also revealed by the bell s inequalities @xcite .",
    "bell s inequalities quantify quantum correlation via expectation values of local complementary observables .",
    "instead , we shall seek a way to directly reveal the essential feature of quantum correlation from an information - theoretical perspective .",
    "indeed , there are several previous entropic measures of quantum correlation ( such as quantum discord @xmath3 , measurement - induced disturbance , symmetric discord , etc ) , which are proposed from an information - theoretical perspective . but",
    "these measures are based on the difference between quantum mutual information @xcite ( which is assumed as the total correlation ) and a certain measure of classical correlation . here , we take a different approach and reveal the essential feature of quantum correlation directly .",
    "the genuine quantum correlation does not vanish under a change of basis , and can be characterized as the residual correlations remaining in the complementary bases .",
    "we begin with a comparison between the correlations in two different states : @xmath4 the first state has only classical correlation , which can be revealed when alice and bob each measure the observable @xmath2 , i.e. , project their qubits onto the basis @xmath5 .",
    "if they measure a complementary observable , @xmath0 or @xmath1 , no correlation between their measurement results exists .",
    "the second state is the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) state ( or the singlet state ) , which has both classical and quantum correlations .",
    "the classical correlation in the epr state can be revealed when alice and bob each measure the same observable , e.g. @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , this kind of correlation also exists simultaneously in complementary bases ( actually , in all bases ) .",
    "the simultaneous existence of correlation in complementary bases is an essential feature of the genuine quantum correlation .",
    "this feature is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figb ] and treated in a rigorous manner in the rest of this letter .    for any bipartite quantum state @xmath6",
    ", there are many measures of classical correlation @xcite . here",
    ", we use the one proposed by henderson and vedral @xcite , which is also used in the definition of quantum discord @xcite .",
    "alice selects a basis @xmath7 of her system in a @xmath8-dimensional hilbert space and performs a measurement projecting her system onto the basis states . with probability @xmath9",
    ", alice will obtain the @xmath10-th basis state @xmath11 , and bob s system will be left in the corresponding state @xmath12 .",
    "the holevo quantity of the ensemble @xmath13 that is prepared for bob by alice via her local measurement is given by @xmath14 , which denotes the upper bound of bob s accessible information about alice s measurement result when alice projects her system onto the basis @xmath15 .",
    "the classical correlation in the state @xmath6 is defined as the maximal holevo quantity over all local projective measurements on alice s system : @xmath16 let @xmath17 denote the optimum basis onto which alice s system is projected such that the maximal holevo quantity is achieved .",
    "we consider another basis @xmath18 , which is mutually unbiased to the basis @xmath17 in the sense that @xmath19 , i.e. , if the system is in a state of one basis , a projective measurement onto the mutually unbiased basis ( mub ) will yield each basis state with the same probability",
    ". the most essential feature of quantum correlation is that when alice performs a measurement in another basis @xmath18 that is mutually unbiased to the optimum basis , bob s accessible information about alice s results , characterized by the holevo quantity , does not vanish .",
    "this residual correlation represents genuine quantum correlation and can be used as a measure of the quantum correlation .",
    "formally , a measure of quantum correlation @xmath20 in the state @xmath6 is defined as the holevo quantity of bob s accessible information about alice s results , maximized over all bases mutually unbiased to the basis @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath21 where @xmath18 is any basis mutually unbiased to the optimum basis @xmath17 that achieves the maximal classical correlation in ( [ defc1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the optimum basis that achieves the maximum quantum correlation in ( [ defq2 ] ) ; it is mutually unbiased to the basis @xmath17 .",
    "similar to the case of characterizing entanglement , a single quantity is not sufficient to describe the full property of quantum correlation because there could be many types of quantum correlation .",
    "following the same line of reasoning , we can define the residual correlation in a third mub as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is any basis mutually unbiased to both @xmath17 and @xmath22 . the optimum basis to achieve the maximum in ( [ defq3 ] )",
    "is denoted as @xmath25 .",
    "suppose in this manner that we can define @xmath26 quantities for the measures of correlation , which are conveniently written as a single correlation vector @xmath27 for the state @xmath6 .",
    "the number @xmath26 can not be greater than the number of mubs that exist in the @xmath8-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the first quantity @xmath28 denotes the maximal classical correlation present in the state @xmath6 , which can be revealed when alice performs a measurement of her system in the basis @xmath17 . as classical correlation will vanish when measured in a mutually unbiased basis ( see the example for cq states ) , all of the other quantities describe genuine quantum types of correlation . the second quantity @xmath29 denotes the maximal genuine quantum correlation , and @xmath22 denotes the optimum basis to reveal this correlation . the third quantity @xmath30 denotes another type of genuine quantum correlation , which is complementary to the first type @xmath29 , and @xmath31 denotes the basis to reveal the second type of quantum correlation",
    "now , we shall calculate the correlation vector for several families of bipartite states , and see how these measures in terms of mubs are well justified as measures of classical and genuine quantum correlations .    for a bipartite pure state written in the schmidt basis , @xmath32",
    ", the maximal classical correlation can be revealed when alice performs her measurement onto her schmidt basis @xmath33 ; thus , one immediately has @xmath34 . if alice chooses another basis @xmath35 , whenever she obtains a particular measurement result , bob will be left with a pure state .",
    "therefore , one can easily obtain the maximal true quantum correlation @xmath36 ; any other basis will yield the same amount of quantum correlation .",
    "therefore , the correlation vector for a bipartite pure state @xmath37 is given as @xmath38 .",
    "the correlation vector exhibits a unique feature of the correlations in a pure state : the classical correlation is equal to the quantum correlation revealed in any basis , and both values are equal to the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix on either side , which is the usual measure of entanglement in a pure state .",
    "a classical - quantum ( cq ) state is a bipartite state that can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a probability distribution , @xmath41 is a basis of system a in a @xmath42-dimensional hilbert space , and @xmath43 is a set of density matrices of system b. the maximal classical correlation is revealed when alice performs her measurement in the basis @xmath44 @xcite ; thus , the maximal classical correlation in the cq state @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 . to calculate the amount of quantum correlation , alice projects her system onto another basis @xmath47 that is mutually unbiased to the optimum basis @xmath48 for classical correlation . from @xmath49",
