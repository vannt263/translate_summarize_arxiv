    "there has been a large deal of interest in the understanding of mechanism of interplay between random noise and a deterministic periodic signal .",
    "it has been found that they act cooperatively in some nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "nature , presumably , exploits this fact to its advantage to tune in to a desired signal @xcite . even for linear , spatially extended stochastic system the cooperative response between noise and deterministic periodic force has been demonstrated very recently @xcite .    the first passage time is a useful tool to investigate the diffusive transport property in a medium .",
    "the theory of first passage time has been worked out in great detail for both infinite medium and explicitly time - independent diffusive processes @xcite . however , for explicitly time - dependent processes and in finite medium an analytic closed form expressions are not available . in this respect",
    "also this problem attracts much attention to the scientific communities .",
    "the process that we are concerned is an overdamped system , having no intrinsic frequency , driven by a periodic force and embedded in a noisy environment which is taken to be gaussian white for simplicity .",
    "the motion is constrained between two traps .",
    "the first analysis of this process has been done for a random walk on a lattice numerically and in a continuous medium with a periodic signal of small amplitude perturbatively @xcite .",
    "their results indicate that the oscillating field can create a form of coherent motion capable of reducing the first passage time by a significant amount . in order to investigate the reason for this cooperative behavior of random noise and deterministic periodic signal , this problem has been formulated in much simpler terms by approximating the sinusoidal periodic signal by the telegraph signal and",
    "later it has been concluded @xcite that the telegraph signal can not produce any cooperative behavior .",
    "subsequently , it has been shown @xcite that if we approximate the sinusoidal signal by a multi - step periodic signal [ explained below ] one would recover the coherent motion .",
    "these authors @xcite have also demonstrated why single - step telegraph signal can not produce any coherent motion as conjectured by the earlier worker @xcite and multi - step telegraph signal does .",
    "while some authors @xcite demonstrated the non - monotonous behavior of the mobility as a function of forcing frequency by calculating the net mass leaving at one of the boundaries for weak force , others have demonstrated the non - monotonous behavior of the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) for small amplitude @xcite and for arbitrary amplitude @xcite in a continuous medium .",
    "these authors @xcite have also demonstrated that the variance of the first passage time density function ( fptdf ) also attains a minimum at the same frequency for which the mfpt shows a minimum when they are plotted as a function of forcing frequency .",
    "this happened for any length of the medium .",
    "such an enhancement of the mobility at some definite forcing frequency depending on the length of the medium clearly exhibits the maximum cooperation between noise and periodic signal and is known in the literature as coherent stochastic resonance ( csr ) .",
    "all the previous analyses @xcite concentrate mainly on the first order moment ( mfpt ) of the first passage time density function ( fptdf ) except in @xcite , where it has been shown that the fptdf at resonance at different lengths of the medium overlap over each other when they are plotted as a function of the cycle of the periodic signal .",
    "this clearly indicates that the resonance feature is , in some sense , universal in nature . to investigate this feature further , we in this paper concentrate on the full profile of fptdf and study the effect of synchronization between noise and deterministic periodic signal in terms of fptdf as we change the frequency .",
    "it is shown that a single dominant peak of fptdf occurs at resonance where the synchronization is maximum .",
    "this feature is quite distinct and is not observed when the system is away from the resonance .",
    "further , a scaling relation is obtained between fptdfs at resonance for different lengths so that one could map fptdf at arbitrary length on a single fptdf at our choice by such scaling relation .",
    "this feature together with the cycle variable of the periodic signal as argument of fptdf conclude the universal feature of fptdf at resonance .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec.ii , we give the formulation of the problem .",
    "the results of the calculations based on the derived formulae are presented in sec.iii .",
    "apart from the explanation of synchronization in terms of fptdf , the scaling behavior of fptdf is also presented in this section .",
    "the fptdf at resonance is expressed in terms of two universal functions , which clearly isolates its dependence on the length of the medium .",
    "further , a simple expression of fptdf at resonance is also obtained in the same section which is shown to be fairly accurate in explaining the behavior at resonance .",
    "finally , a few concluding remarks have been added in sec.iv .",
    "the system that we consider is described by a fokker planck equation    @xmath0    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the amplitude and frequency of the sinusoidal signal , and @xmath3 is the strength of the gaussian white noise .",
    "the motion is confined between two absorbing boundaries at @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; i.e. , eq.([eq.1 ] ) is supplemented with absorbing boundary conditions @xmath6 . in terms of the dimensionless variables",
    "@xmath7    the eq.([eq.1 ] ) is conveniently written as    @xmath8    the boundary conditions read in terms of the new variables ( 2 ) as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 . in the following",
    "we calculate all the physical quantities in terms of these new variables and if required , one may translate all the interpretations in terms of the usual variables by the transformation equations eq.([eq.2 ] ) .",
    "no analytic solution exists for eq.([eq.3 ] ) with the boundary conditions as mentioned .",
    "we thus introduce a scheme to approximate the force @xmath11 as a multi - step periodic signal @xcite .",
    "this scheme is in contrast to the procedure adopted in @xcite , where they discretise the eq.([eq.3 ] ) using finite difference method and simulate the problem on a lattice of space and time .",
    "the construction of multi - step periodic signal @xcite is as follows .",
    "we divide the half cycle of the signal by @xmath12 intervals so that each interval in the horizontal @xmath13-axis is of size @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "we define @xmath12numbers @xmath16 along the vertical axis as    [ eq.4 ] @xmath17}{2}~ ; k = 1,2, ... ,p \\\\s_{p+1 } & = & 1 \\\\s_{p+1+r } & = & s_{p+1-r}~ ; r = 1,2, ... ,p .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    each number @xmath18 is associated with the interval@xmath19 with @xmath20 . the eq.([eq.4 ] ) clearly shows that    @xmath21    eq.([eq.5 ] ) states that in order to reach the maximum value @xmath22 of the signal from the zero level we have to have @xmath23 step up and from the maximum to the zero level we have @xmath23 step down .",
    "this is for the positive half - cycle . for the negative half - cycle",
    "similar constructions have been done with the replacement @xmath24 and each number @xmath25 is associated with the interval @xmath26<\\theta\\leq \\bigtriangleup \\theta [ 1 + \\frac { k}{2p+1}]$ ] with @xmath27 .",
    "this aproximation for the full one cycle of the sinusoidal signal ( as shown in fig.1 ) is then repeated for the next successive cycles .",
    "one may however note that the @xmath28 which we have defined for this approximated signal is not the same as that of sinusoidal signal because the fourier transform of sinusoidal signal would give only one frequency while this approximated signal in the fourier space corresponds to many sinusoidal frequencies specially because of its sharp discontinuities .",
    "yet we urge this approximation because in each interval the equation become time - independent .",
    "in the future development we associate the index @xmath29 for the positive half - cycle and index @xmath30 for the negative .",
    "index @xmath31 will refer the cycle number . since the fokker - planck equation eq.([eq.3 ] ) in each interval will be that for a constant bias , we can express the conditional probability density function @xmath32 in terms of complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions @xmath33 satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35~,\\ ] ]    where    [ eq.7 ] @xmath36    with @xmath37 as the corresponding value of @xmath16 in the appropriate interval where the conditional probability is being decomposed .",
    "the conditional probability density function in any interval , say @xmath38 , can then be calculated from the previous history by convoluting it in each previous intervals :    @xmath39    for the negative half - cycle the calculation of probability density function is similar except that we have to replace the index @xmath29 by @xmath30 and the probability density function is decomposed as    @xmath40~,\\ ] ]    where the expressions for @xmath41 and @xmath42 are same as in eqs.([eq.7 ] ) .    the survival probability at time @xmath13 when the particle is known to start from @xmath43 at @xmath44 is defined as    @xmath45    the first passage time density function ( fptdf ) @xmath46 is defined as    @xmath47    physically",
    ", @xmath48 gives the probability that the particle arrives at any one of the boundaries in the time interval @xmath13 and @xmath49 . from this density function",
    "one can calculate various moments :    @xmath50    from eq.([eq.12 ] ) one can easily calculate mean first passage time(mfpt ) @xmath51 and the variance @xmath52 of the density function @xmath46 .",
    "it is then quite straightforward to calculate the fptdf at any interval of any cycle .",

    "we have already demonstrated @xcite that @xmath69 approximation or usual telegraph signal approximation of the sinusoidal signal does not produce any resonance . in all the following calculations we restrict to @xmath70 ,",
    "although @xmath71 approximation of the signal does produce the resonance .",
    "but the @xmath70 signal approximates better than the @xmath71 signal .",
    "further we take @xmath72 , i.e. , the particle is assumed to start from the mid point of the medium .",
    "the fptdf @xmath73 for different frequencies are plotted as a function of @xmath13 for a given length @xmath74 in fig.2 . for very low frequency ( for e.g.,@xmath75 ) , the particle is acted on by a constant force @xmath76 ( in the multi - step periodic approximation ) almost all the time before it reaches the boundary .",
    "the fptdf curve shows that we have only one maximum in the entire @xmath13-regime .",
    "as the frequency slowly increases , the curve shows that apart from only one profile appearing left and showing a maximum like before , a small peak at large @xmath13 also shows up ( for e.g. , @xmath77 ) .",
    "this is because the particle at this frequency , although most of the time sees a constant bias @xmath76 , at later time it might encounter a increased bias @xmath78 for a short time before it reaches the boundary . as @xmath79 , therefore the area under the major profile decreases and",
    "this decrement has been compensated by the small peak at the right end of the profile .",
    "in other words , the @xmath46 for this frequency consists of two curves superposed over each other .",
    "further increase of frequency ( for e.g.,@xmath80 ) shows the similar behavior as with @xmath77 but here the first peak area decreases and second peak area increases more than that with @xmath77 .",
    "what we have been doing is that we follow the @xmath46 profile as we increase the frequency and observe a systematic change in the constituent profiles .",
    "as the frequency increases more , other biases @xmath18 with @xmath81 start playing their roles in constructing the fptdf profile . for e.g.,@xmath82 , we have another little peak at extreme right starts developing . as frequency further increases , this last peak starts developing further , while the first peak which has been dominant at very low frequency starts slowly decreasing .",
    "our previous study with this scheme @xcite shows that the mfpt has a minimum for this length ( @xmath83 ) at @xmath84 .",
    "we have identified this frequency as resonant frequency because we have argued that the synchronization between the signal and noise is maximum at this frequency causing the enhancement of probability of reaching the boundary at a short time .",
    "the fptdf profile at resonance evidently shows a dominant single peak at this frequency .",
    "more smoother and nice single dominant peak at resonance is observed for higher length [ see for e.g.,fig.7 ] . slightly below this resonance frequency",
    "@xmath85 the fptdf profile contains two peaks , the maxima of them are close to each other and the peak which has been dominant at very low frequency diminishes so much that only very close observation of its nature starting from low frequency would help identify its existence .",
    "we further note that the constituent profiles of fptdf adjust themselves in a very distinct way , as the frequency increases , in order to produce a dominant maximum at the resonance .    in order to explain synchronization we must interpret the cooperation in terms of correlation between the components of fptdf profile . for this purpose we start looking at the fptdf profiles for the frequencies higher than the resonant frequency . we have argued that at resonance , the synchronization becomes at its peak . after this resonant frequency ,",
    "another small and distinct peak ( for e.g. , @xmath86 ) starts developing .",
    "the area of the dominant peak starts reducing .",
    "as frequency increases further beyond the resonance frequency , more number of peaks start coming up over a little background ( for e.g. , @xmath87 ) . after the resonance ,",
    "the peaks are quite distinct and identified separately over the visible background .",
    "following the dominant peak beyond resonance , it is natural to identify the area of the peak as a degree of synchronization .",
    "our previous study with this scheme @xcite shows that the mfpt increases beyond the resonance . in these figures",
    "we find that the dominant peak whose area is maximum at resonance decreases as we go beyond the resonant frequency . in other words ,",
    "the degree of synchronization is getting reduced beyond the resonance frequency .",
    "clearly we can find the areas of the individual distinct peaks and the background .",
    "the profile of the background is obtained by fitting the minima of the fptdf profile .",
    "going backwards from high frequency side it is clearly visible that the background area diminishes as we approach the resonance ; most of the area is taken up in producing the major dominant peak at resonance .",
    "the question naturally would be how one can distinguish the components , namely the background and the peaks as we decrease the frequency below the resonant frequency .",
    "the clue to the answer of this question lies in the fptdf profile at very low frequency . as we have already noticed that at very low frequency we have only one peak ( for e.g. , @xmath75 ) .",
    "the area of this curve gradually decreases as the frequency increases and approaches its minimum at resonance .",
    "after the resonant frequency , it appears clearly as background on top of which the peaks are occuring .",
    "it is evident that this curve does not really play a role in making the dominant peak at resonance .",
    "the other two peaks which appear at larger frequencies ( say , at @xmath88 ) start adjusting themselves constructively to produce a large dominant peak at resonance @xmath89 .",
    "once we identify the background in the low frequency regime by following the component corresponding to the curve at @xmath90 , the area of the rest of the profile of fptdf at any frequency over the background could be easily calculated . as we have argued that the two peaks really overlap each other especially near the resonance and adjust themselves constructively",
    ", the area under these should be a measure of synchronization before the resonance .",
    "having identified the background , so far as the resonance is concerned , we try to fit this component in each fptdf profile . as mentioned before , for very low frequency the full fptdf gives the profile of the background .",
    "we have also noted that at extremely low frequency , in our multi - step periodic signal scheme , the particle experiences a constant bias @xmath76 throught the entire time .",
    "but no simple analytical formula of fptdf in such situation exists .",
    "however , for semi - infinite domain , if we have an absorbing boundary at @xmath91 and the particle starts from @xmath92 the exact analytic expression for fptdf was evaluated by schrodinger @xcite .",
    "the expression reads as    @xmath93    we plot this expression and superpose over actual fptdf curve at @xmath77 . the plot is shown in fig .",
    "it appears that although for low @xmath13 this function gives excellent fit , for large @xmath13 it overestimates the background .",
    "therefore we modify this function in the following way to arrive at a better fit of the background .",
    "@xmath94    the fitted curve with @xmath95 is shown in the same figure [ fig.3(b ) ] .",
    "as frequency changes and approaches resonance , @xmath96 and @xmath97 change . the area under this curve , @xmath98 , is plotted in fig.4a and found decreasing before resonance . after resonance , the profile of the visible background is obtained by joining the minima of fptdf profile at each frequency . when the minima are plotted as a function of @xmath13",
    ", it fits with the same curve eq.([eq.18 ] ) with @xmath99 and @xmath100 . only @xmath97",
    "is found changing slowly and the area under this curve is found increasing as the frequency increases beyond resonance ( fig.4a ) .",
    "this concludes the characterization of the background .",
    "the area of the peaks over the background , p , responsible for constructing resonance before the resonance frequency is also plotted in the same figure ( fig.4a ) and found increasing with frequency . at resonance , as expected this area denoting the degree of synchronization attains a peak .",
    "as we follow the area of the dominant peak beyond resonance , it is found decreasing with frequency showing the degree of synchronization is getting reduced as we go beyond the resonant frequency .",
    "this is also demonstrated in fig.4a .",
    "further , beyond the resonance , as mentioned before , apart from the dominant peak there are other smaller peaks appearing at the top of the background .",
    "the areas , @xmath101 , under first two sucessive peaks beyond the dominant peak are also plotted as a function of frequency in the fig.4b .",
    "these curves also show non - monotonous behavior .",
    "this shows that the synchronization might also occur at higher frequency but as the maximum area covered by these peaks are much less , they denote synchronization of lesser degree .",
    "this completes the explanation of synchronization behavior between noise and deterministic periodic signal as we change the frequency .",
    "we have already noted that the fptdf exihibits a dominant peak at resonance .",
    "this feature is observed for any length . in our previous study",
    "@xcite we have found a simple relation between the resonant frequency @xmath102 and the length of the medium @xmath103 .",
    "the expression reads as    @xmath104    it is further interesting to observe that the normalised fptdf @xmath105 when plotted as a function cycle variable [ @xmath106 , they overlap over each other .",
    "the curves for different lengths are plotted in fig.5 .",
    "this figure clearly shows that at resonance cycle variable is the correct argument to describe the resonance feature .",
    "we may further note that such scaling of the argument of fptdf would not be possible for any frequency other than the resonant frequencies because any frequency which is not the resonant frequency for one length may turn out to be the resonant frequency for some other length and the features of fptdf are different for resonant and off - resonant frequencies as has been observed from fig.2 .",
    "having found the proper scaling of the argument of fptdf , it is natural to enquire whether the fptdf , @xmath107 can also be scaled properly , so that once @xmath108 with @xmath109 is found for one length , the function @xmath108 can be obtained for any arbitrary length .    in order to investigate this issue",
    ", first we observe that going from @xmath110 to @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are two different lengths we have to multiply one function by different amount depending on the value of the argument .",
    "thus if at all any scaling relation exists , this should be of the form    @xmath114    it is indeed found to be true with @xmath115 given in fig.6 .",
    "we note that @xmath115 is universal . from the relation ( 20 )",
    "it is obvious that    @xmath116^{-\\alpha(x ) } f_{\\mu\\lambda}(x).\\ ] ]    the eq.([eq.21 ] ) shows that the function @xmath117 is independent of @xmath103 and it is again universal .",
    "we verify this result in our calculation of fptdf for different lengths and call this function @xmath118 .",
    "the @xmath119 is also plotted in fig.6 .",
    "thus we could express @xmath120 at resonance in terms of two universal functions @xmath118 and @xmath115 as    @xmath121    the expression(22 ) clearly isolates the dependence of fptdf on length of the medium @xmath103 at resonance .",
    "therefore , for any arbitrary length @xmath103 the fptdf at rsonance can be found from this simple expression .",
    "we next fitted the universal functions @xmath115 and @xmath119 with the simple functions as    @xmath122    where @xmath123 are positive constants and @xmath124 with @xmath125 being the position of the maximum of @xmath108 . with these approximate expressions ( 23 ) the normalised fptdf @xmath120 at resonance takes a very neat expression    @xmath126    with @xmath127 .",
    "the normalisation of fptdf suggests that @xmath128 .",
    "it is indeed found that this approximate form ( 24 ) would result normalisation constant , for the lengths we consider , almost independent of @xmath103 and very close to unity .",
    "the approximate form @xmath120 is plotted for a typical length @xmath129 and compared with actual data points in fig.7 .",
    "it is giving an excellent agreement .",
    "further with this form , the mfpt is found for different @xmath103 .",
    "it also yields linear behaviour in agreement with our previous study @xcite .",
    "this shows that not only we have found a scaling behaviour ( 20 ) which takes @xmath108 from one length to the other , it is also possible to obtain a simple expression ( 24 ) for @xmath120 for any arbitrary length .",
    "we consider a diffusive transport process perturbed by a periodic signal in continuous one dimensional medium having two absorbing boundaries .",
    "no perturbation of the signal amplitude is assumed in this formulation .",
    "the scheme we have adopted in this formulation is different from the finite difference method to solve the partial differential equation eq.([eq.3 ] ) as adopted in @xcite .",
    "the cooperative behaviour between the deterministic periodic signal and random noise leading to coherent motion is demonstrated in terms of fptdf profile .",
    "we show explicitly that synchronization between the signal and random noise is maximum at resonance where fptdf exhibits a major dominant peak .",
    "an important characteristic that we observe is that the cycle number is the correct argument to describe fptdf at resonance .",
    "we also show that there exists a scaling relation between fptdf at various lengths through some universal function @xmath115 . the exact expression for fptdf at resonance",
    "is obtained in terms of two universal functions which clearly isolates its dependence on the length of the medium .",
    "this is an universal feature of coherent stochastic resonance .",
    "further a nice simple approximate form for fptdf at resonance is obtained which is shown to be fairly accurate in explaining the behavior at resonance .",
    "this form may be of use in obtaining quicker result in cases where more complex situation has been called for .",
    "although we restrict our calculation with a three - step ( @xmath70 ) periodic signal , the formulation is quite general and applicable for any approximation with an arbitrary number of steps .",
    "this formulation can also be applied to any arbitrary continuous periodic signal . for @xmath130 periodic",
    "signal the background could be identified as before .",
    "the resonance occurs for the length @xmath74 exactly at the same frequency @xmath131 .",
    "we obtain a major dominant peak at resonance .",
    "the only difference that we observe is that the component of fptdf just before resonance which makes the peak at resonance constitutes only one peak instead of two as with @xmath70 .",
    "the reason for which is tailored as each half - cycle of the sinusoidal signal is approximated with three steps for @xmath71 as against with five steps with @xmath70 . however , after resonance frequency the behaviour is similar as with @xmath70 signal .",
    "the peak positions of normalised fptdfs at resonance occur very near to a quarter of a cycle . from fig.5",
    "we observe a slight deviation of the peak positions but we believe that if the sinusoidal signal is approximated by more than three - step periodic signal , the position of all the peaks will be the same .",
