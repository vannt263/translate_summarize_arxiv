    "wireless networks are ubiquitous and are on their way to become even more prevalent , e.g. , with the advent of internet - of - things . wireless communication is , however , particularly challenging to model algorithmically . in two crucial interrelated aspects ,",
    "wireless networks on the ground differ from models typically assumed in algorithmic studies .",
    "one is the _ communication modeling _ : when is a transmission successfully decoded , as a function of the environment and the _ interference _ from other transmissions .",
    "the other is _ variability with time _ : wireless networks are particularly susceptible to changes .",
    "both of these are hard to capture accurately with well - defined , clear - cut rules .",
    "we aim in this paper to address core information dissemination problems  _ local broadcast _ and ( global ) _ broadcast _  in dynamic distributed networks , under very weak assumptions on the communication . to this end",
    ", we propose a communication model with significant flexibility that allows for adversarial control , generalizing essentially all known analytic wireless models .",
    "it allows for more general interference relationships than treated before",
    ". the network can experience adversarial dynamic behavior , both edge changes ( change of signal strengths ) and node insertions / deletions .",
    "wireless communication has traditionally been modeled theoretically by graphs , either geometric or general .",
    "interference is then also transmitted on graph edges ( precluding a node from receiving a message from a neighbor if another neighbor is transmitting ) , but is sometimes represented by a supergraph . _",
    "fading channel _ or _ physical _ models common in communication engineering , on the other hand , consider interference as cumulative , decreasing with distance but adding up .",
    "they have been popular in recent algorithmic studies , adding more realism to the formulation .",
    "the standard assumption of _ geometric signal decay _ ( that signal decreases inverse polynomially with distance ) in the sinr model , the prototypical fading channel , is though equally at odds with experimental evidence . ultimately , it may prove futile to hope for a clean deterministic model , or even a purely stochastic one , without a significant dose of unpredictability and non - determinism .",
    "wireless communication is commonly closely linked to mobility , as the transceivers are more often than not on the move .",
    "dynamic changes to reception conditions have many causes other than node mobility , since almost any changes in the environment affect transmissions due to reflections of signals over multiple paths , antenna characteristics , scattering , and diffraction .",
    "these changes are by nature hard to predict , even when assuming a `` mobility model '' . the most robust approach would then be to assume a non - trivial adversarial component .",
    "while the study of algorithms in dynamic networks has a long history , little has been done in cases where interference plays a role .",
    "* setting and model*.   nodes are distributed and autonomous . there is no built - in structure and the nodes have no information besides bounds on model parameters and an upper bound on the number of nodes .",
    "communication is locally synchronous , but there is no global clock .",
    "we will assume a very general model for when nodes successfully communicate .",
    "nodes are located in space , with separation between points given by the relative decrease in strength of signal ( or interference ) sent between the points .",
    "this induces a metric space , when these decays are raised to the appropriate power  actually , it is a _ quasi - metric _ , since symmetry need not hold .",
    "for distributed computation to be possible , the quasi - metric must have _ bounded independence _",
    "( to be defined precisely ) .",
    "_ edge changes _ can occur , with some restrictions , which are changes in the signal strength between the pair of points .",
    "the rule for when communication is successful is only partially pre - specified : transmission succeeds on a `` clear channel '' .",
    "that is , if a sender is within a _ communication radius _ from the receiver , if no other node transmits within a ( larger ) radius , and if the combined interference from all other transmitting nodes is ( quite ) small , then the transmission succeeds .",
    "otherwise , success is up to the adversary , or it can be further specified by the particular model assumptions desired .",
    "this captures essentially all known algorithmic wireless models ( including quasi - unit disc graphs , unit - ball graphs , bounded - independence graphs , @xmath0-hop extensions , and sinr ) .",
    "the only exception is the radio network model with general graphs , which can not be extended to involve comprehensive interference without a major hit in time complexity .",
    "the generality of our model is a key feature .",
    "given the vagaries of actual wireless environments , it is preferable for robustness reasons to make minimal assumptions about the communication model .",
    "a conservative approach is then to seek algorithms that work in most established models rather than depending on model - specific factors that simplify the life of the algorithm designer .",
    "[ [ dynamic - network - model ] ] dynamic network model + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the network is dynamic , both in terms of nodes and links .",
    "nodes can come and go , potentially adversarially .",
    "this includes the situation where nodes are wakened by other nodes .",
    "we only expect nodes that have been awake for long enough ( logarithmic number of rounds ) to participate in the computation , i.e. , the _",
    "stable _ nodes .    in the _ local broadcast _",
    "problem , all stable nodes should inform all of their ( stable ) neighbors ( i.e. , within the communication radius ) . in the _ broadcast _",
    "problem , the nodes in the network are to be informed of a message that initially resides at a source node .",
    "the network need not be connected at any instant in time , but we need to make assumptions about what transient paths are usable by an algorithm operating under interference .",
    "this leads to a definition of a _ dynamic diameter _ of the network , that becomes the competitive objective for the time complexity .",
    "* our approach and results*.   the key algorithmic technique is a natural randomized _ contention balancing _ procedure , where a node continuously adjusts its transmission probability based on the interference that it senses .",
    "it allows nodes to stabilize quickly from any initial conditions , or after waking up .",
    "this routine is a variation on an old story , a simple backoff procedure to manage local contention :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if a node @xmath1 senses contention in a given round beyond a fixed threshold , then @xmath1 halves its transmission probability in the next round and otherwise doubles it . _",

    "it proves also to be surprisingly tolerant of different communication models .",
    "the higher level algorithms are then built on top of this primitive .",
    "a crucial component is the use of _ carrier sense _ to detect the cumulative amount of signals in the air .",
    "since it is supplied by the cheapest available hardware today as rss ( received signal strength ) readings , we posit that carrier - sense capability should be the default assumption in wireless algorithmics ( while exploring the necessity of different assumptions is interesting theoretically ) . as carrier - sense indicators can provide fine - grained information , we are interested in restraining its use and identifying which aspects are necessary to achieve the results obtained . to this end , we identify several _ primitives _ that carrier - sense can supply , restrict the algorithm to use only a subset of the primitives , and examine which of these are truly necessary .",
    "the local broadcast algorithm simply runs the contention balancing procedure , with nodes bowing out when they are sure to have completed their transmission .",
    "the broadcast algorithms are based on sparsifying the instance , so that only nodes of constant density actually participate in the global broadcast action .",
    "the former is achieved in @xmath2 time , where @xmath3 is the maximum number of neighbors that a node can have , while the latter takes @xmath4 rounds , where @xmath5 is a dynamic diameter .",
    "these dissemination algorithms are efficient enough to improve on some of the results known for static versions of the problems .",
    "the local broadcast algorithm is strongly optimal , or within constant factors on every instance . in the standard",
    "setting ( static , spontaneous case ) , the algorithm is _ uniform _ , in that it need not know the network size .",
    "the broadcast algorithm is also optimal and uniform in the same setting , while in the non - spontaneous setting it is faster by a logarithmic factor than the previous algorithm of @xcite that however does not require carrier sense .",
    "* closely related work*.   there are two largely disjoint bodies of work of wireless algorithmic results , with work on fading models like sinr slowly catching up with the better studied graph - based models .",
    "one approach for capturing more realism in sinr model is to move beyond euclidean metrics @xcite , even to general ones @xcite .",
    "one can view relative signal decrease as implicitly defining a quasi - distance metric @xcite .",
    "link scheduling problems can be formulated on edge - weighted interference graphs @xcite that properly generalize both graph - based and sinr models , linked by a graph - theoretic parameter . distributed dissemination problems , however , necessarily require metric restrictions , such as doubling or _ fading _",
    "metrics @xcite , and limits on communication abilities in order to capture both types of models .",
    "the local broadcast and global broadcast problems have been extensively studied in both graph - based radio network models  @xcite and the sinr model  @xcite . for local broadcast ,",
    "the best results known in the radio network model are both @xmath6 with and without knowing ( an upper bound on ) @xmath3  @xcite . in the sinr model , with knowledge of @xmath3 , the local broadcast can be accomplished in the same time bound as in the radio network model @xcite .",
    "if @xmath3 is not known , the best result is @xmath7  @xcite , which is improved to @xmath2 with free acknowledgments @xcite .",
    "this can be further improved to @xmath8 in the spontaneous case , when @xmath3 is known  @xcite .",
    "the time complexity of non - spontaneous broadcasting in the radio network model is @xmath9  @xcite without collision detection . with collision detection , this lower bound",
    "was recently broken in  @xcite , where a solution of @xmath10 was given .",
    "broadcasting has also been treated in the sinr model under a variety of assumptions .",
    "some are stronger than ours ( location information @xcite , power control @xcite ) , while others relax the assumption about the connectivity property , incurring necessarily much higher complexity @xcite . results in our setting , but without carrier sensing , include time complexity of @xmath11 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where @xmath12 denotes the maximum ratio between distances of stations connected in the communication graph ; and @xmath13 @xcite . in the spontaneous setting , where the nodes can build an overlay structure along which",
    "the message is then propagated , scheideler et al .",
    "@xcite used carrier sense to give a dominator algorithms , which can be applied to solve broadcast in @xmath14 rounds .",
    "yu et al .",
    "@xcite solved the problem in the same time bound using power control , while the algorithm in  @xcite that requires neither power control nor carrier sense runs in time @xmath15 .",
    "these problems have also been treated in dynamic networks . in",
    "the _ unstructured _ model @xcite , where nodes may wake up asynchronously ( modeling the node insertion ) , the local broadcast problem is well studied , even in the sinr setting  @xcite , but this model does not consider node deletion . in the _ dual graph",
    "_ model  @xcite ( originally due to @xcite ) , both the local broadcast  @xcite and global broadcast  @xcite problems are studied . but",
    "this model involves only edge behavior and not node changes ( churn ) .",
    "hence , the impact of dynamicity on wireless information dissemination is still largely unexplored .",
    "considering wireless interference , there are two classes of wireless network models : graph - based and physical models .",
    "basically , the graph - based models define a local and binary type of interference , while the physical models consider fading effect of signal on wireless channels .",
    "there are many widely used graph - based models , such as the unit disc graph ( udg ) model  @xcite ( unit ball graph ( ubg ) model  @xcite ) , the quasi unit disc graph ( qudg ) model  @xcite , the protocol model  @xcite , the bounded - independence graph ( big ) model  @xcite and the @xmath0-hop variants of the above models  @xcite .",
    "physical models , also known as sinr models  @xcite , capture the missing practical issues in wireless interference , such as fading and cumulativeness of wireless interference . most of current works in the sinr model focus on networks embedded in euclidean space , while many of the results hold also for doubling or `` bounded growth '' metrics @xcite .",
    "those doubling metrics constrain growth at every ( or arbitrarily small ) granularity , while ours only bounds regions proportional to the transmission range , in particular capturing bounded independence graphs ( big ) .",
