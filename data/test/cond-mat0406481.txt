    "in the recent years , the interplay between entanglement and quantum phase transitions has been the subject of many studies . since the pioneering works on the ising model in a transverse magnetic field",
    "@xcite exhibiting the key role played by entanglement in quantum critical phenomena , lots of effort have been devoted to characterize the intricate structure of the ground state in spin systems @xcite as well as in electron models @xcite .",
    "all these studies show that entanglement , a genuine quantum property , can be used to probe the phase diagram of a system and especially to detect quantum phase transitions .",
    "unfortunately , such analyses are often restricted to one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems where exact solutions exist and allow one to deal with the thermodynamical limit .",
    "usually , higher - dimensional systems require a numerical treatment which is limited by the hilbert space dimension which grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "however , when the hamiltonian has a large symmetry group as is here the case , it is still possible to study the large-@xmath0 limit .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider @xmath0 mutually interacting spins @xmath1 embedded in a magnetic field .",
    "the restriction of this model to the fully symmetric subspace can be mapped , via the schwinger representation , onto interacting bosons in a two - level system coupled by a tunneling term .",
    "thus , although it has initially been introduced by lipkin , meshkov , and glick ( lmg ) @xcite in nuclear physics , this model is also relevant to describe the josephson effect , or two - mode bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "this ubiquity in very different domains is certainly one of the reason why it has been periodically rediscovered ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "its integrability has even recently been proved in a series of paper ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) and a complete solution has been derived using the algebraic bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "the ground state entanglement properties of this model have been analyzed for both ferromagnetic @xcite and antiferromagnetic coupling @xcite using the concurrence @xcite ( see below for details ) . here , our goal is to analyze the entanglement dynamics which has , so far , been mostly investigated in 1d spin systems @xcite .",
    "the possibility of experiments in bec s has led several groups to study the dynamics in the lmg model but entanglement has been discussed only recently @xcite . in this study , we investigate the time evolution of two peculiar states which are relevant in the bec context since they correspond to situations where all atoms are either in one of the two modes or equally distributed between both modes .",
    "for these two states , we discuss the entanglement dynamics through two observables : namely , the one - tangle which measures the entanglement of one spin with all others and the concurrence which quantifies the two - spin entanglement . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the lmg model and discuss its phase diagram . in sec .",
    "[ measures ] , we define the entanglement measures used throughout this paper and give several canonical examples . the ground - state entanglement properties @xcite are briefly recalled in sec . [ ground ] .",
    "the quantum dynamics is presented in sec .",
    "[ dynamics ] for the two states mentioned above .",
    "we show that the one - tangle and the concurrence have completely different behaviors depending on the initial state .",
    "these characteristics can be understood in several limiting cases that we discuss in detail .",
    "we consider a system of mutually interacting spins @xmath1 embedded in a magnetic field described by the following hamiltonian introduced by lmg @xcite in a more general form : @xmath2 where the @xmath3 s are the pauli matrices and @xmath4 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath5 is necessary to get a finite free energy per spin in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath6 preserves the magnitude of the total spin and does not couple states having a different parity of the number of spins pointing in the magnetic field direction ( spin - flip symmetry ) : namely , @xmath7&=&0,\\\\ \\bigg [ h,\\prod_i \\sigma_z^i \\bigg ] & = & 0 . \\label{phaseflip}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the phase diagram of this model can be easily derived using a semiclassical description @xcite . for a ferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath8 ) , the system undergoes a second - order quantum phase transition at the critical field @xmath9 , whereas for antiferromagnetic interactions , a first - order quantum phase transition occurs at zero field .",
    "to analyze the entanglement dynamics , we focus here on two commonly used quantities : the one - tangle which measures the entanglement of one spin with the others and the concurrence which measures the two - spin entanglement . for a given pure state @xmath10 ,",
    "both quantities are computed from the density matrix @xmath11 .",
    "the one - tangle is defined as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the one - spin reduced density matrix obtained from @xmath14 by tracing out over all spins except spin @xmath15 and where @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the one - tangle @xmath17 ranges between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it vanishes for a state such that @xmath20 and reaches @xmath19 for maximally entangled states such as the famous einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) state @xcite @xmath21 to measure the two - spin entanglement , we consider the concurrence @xmath22 introduced by wootters @xcite .",
    "this quantity is computed from the two - spin reduced density matrix @xmath23 obtained by tracing out @xmath14 over all spins except spins @xmath15 and @xmath24 .",
    "next , we introduce the spin - flipped density matrix @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the complex conjugate of @xmath23 . the concurrence @xmath22 is then defined by @xmath27 where the @xmath28 s are the square roots of the four real eigenvalues of @xmath29 and where @xmath30 .",
    "the concurrence vanishes , for example , for any state @xmath31 and reaches its maximum value @xmath32 for states such as @xmath33 .",
    "let us also mention that @xmath34 and @xmath22 are related through the coffman - kundu - wootters ( ckw ) conjecture @xcite stating that @xmath35 note that for pure two - spin states , we have an exact equality . in the present study",
    ", we have systematically checked that this conjecture ( [ ckwconj ] ) was always verified .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that tracing out the density matrix @xmath14 can induce or destroy some correlations between spins .",
    "for instance , a nonseparable state , such as the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite @xmath36 has a maximum one - tangle @xmath37 and a vanishing concurrence @xmath38 .",
    "it is thus important to keep in mind that these measures only give partial information about the entanglement of the state .",
    "we recall in this section the main features of the ground state entanglement and we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion .    as explained in sec .",
    "[ model ] , the ground state of @xmath6 is well described by a mean - field approach showing that in the thermodynamical limit the ground state is given by a product state @xcite for which @xmath39 . however , in the symmetric phase ( @xmath8 and @xmath40 ) , we underline that the ground state is twofold degenerate in the thermodynamical limit whereas at finite-@xmath0 , it is unique ( except for @xmath41 ) . in the degenerate case , one must consider the thermal density matrix at zero temperature @xcite to compute the entanglement properties .",
    "this implies in particular that the one - tangle in this phase is given by @xmath42 , and that @xmath43 in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "however , the finite @xmath0 corrections to this separable asymptotic form allow one to capture a nontrivial behavior of the rescaled concurrence @xmath44 .",
    "this rescaling is actually the coordination number of each site and takes into account the fact that the two - site entanglement , as measured by the concurrence , is , in this model , equally shared between all sites .    for a ferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath8 )",
    ", @xmath45 displays a cusplike behavior at the critical point @xmath46 ( see fig .",
    "[ concgs ] ) where @xmath45 goes to @xmath19 in the thermodynamical limit .    in the antiferromagnetic case ,",
    "@xmath45 is a smoothly decreasing function of @xmath47 but is discontinuous at @xmath41 where a first - order transition occurs ( see fig .",
    "[ concgs ] ) . for @xmath48",
    ", @xmath45 reaches @xmath19 in the thermodynamical limit , but for @xmath41 , the ground state is given by zero total spin states for which @xmath49 .",
    "( thin line ) and @xmath50 ( thick line ) ( @xmath51 spins ) . in both cases , @xmath49 for @xmath41.,width=377 ]    except for this very special point , the ground state always lies in the maximum spin sector @xmath52 for any @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , at finite @xmath0 and in the large - field limit , the ground state is the fully polarized state in the @xmath54 direction , @xmath55 for which one also has @xmath49 .    in the antiferromagnetic case ,",
    "the entanglement properties of the ground state ( restricted to the maximum spin sector @xmath52 ) have also been analyzed by hines _",
    "_ @xcite through the von neumann entropy @xmath56 for bipartite systems . in bec language",
    ", the two subsystems correspond to the two components of the condensate , _",
    "i.  e. _ to the states polarized in the @xmath57 direction .",
    "this quantity has thus nothing to do with the concurrence and its behavior is indeed very different : @xmath58 vanishes for @xmath41 ( since @xmath59 ) whereas @xmath45 is maximum ( in this spin sector ) and @xmath58 is maximum in the large - field limit whereas @xmath45 vanishes .",
    "more recently , another entropy @xmath60 has been analyzed in the lmg model @xcite .",
    "this entropy is based on a bipartite decomposition in two subsytems of size @xmath61 and @xmath62 . here",
    ", @xmath60 has been found to be maximum at the critical point @xmath63 in agreement with a recent conjecture proposed by hines _",
    "moreover , a logarithmic scaling has been observed and may reveal an underlying 1d conformal field theory @xcite for the lmg model .",
    "in this section , we analyze the quantum dynamics of two initial states belonging to the maximum spin subspace @xmath52 :    1 .",
    "the state @xmath64 fully polarized in the @xmath65 direction which corresponds , in bec language , to a state where the atoms are all localized in one of the two modes : 2 .",
    "the state @xmath66 fully polarized in the @xmath54 direction which corresponds , in the bec language , to a state where the atoms are equally distributed between both modes ( catlike state ) .",
    "the quantum dynamics of these two states have already been widely studied for this model in the bec context @xcite . here , we focus on the entanglement dynamics by studying the time evolution of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which do not depend on the spins kept in the trace operation since states belonging to the subspace @xmath52 are invariant under the permutation group .",
    "this implies in particular that @xmath34 and @xmath45 only depend on the magnetization @xmath69 and on the correlations functions @xmath70 @xcite .      as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spectrum of @xmath6 remains discrete in the thermodynamical limit ; _",
    "i.  e. _ , the mean level spacing remains finite when @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "for equidistant levels , we would expect to have a poincar time that does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "however , it turns out that the poincar time scales here linearly with @xmath0 . as noticed by milburn _",
    "@xcite , the semiclassical dynamics ( see below ) mimicks very well the quantum dynamics up to a given time scale @xmath71 which is of the order of the poincar time . for times smaller than @xmath71 ,",
    "the system thus remains nonentangled and in the large-@xmath0 limit , it is described by the classical equations of motion ( see appendix [ semiclassical ] ) . for times larger than @xmath71 quantum effects become important ,",
    "some revivals of the wavepacket are observed , and the latter approach fails .",
    "it is thus in this regime that interesting and nontrivial entanglement properties must be analyzed .",
    "consequently , we always consider a dimensionless rescaled time @xmath72 which allows us to investigate the dynamics and to easily compare the results for various @xmath0 .",
    "of course , we have checked in each situation that the time - averaged results were weakly sensitive to the the time range chosen provided this latter was sufficiently large .",
    "we must also mention recent studies @xcite which reveal multiple time scales in the lmg model ( called the boson - hubbard dimer model in these papers ) .",
    "however , the range of validity of these results is confined to @xmath73 ( small - tunnelling - amplitude regime in boson language ) which is not the regime considered here .",
    "yet we can not exclude larger characteristic time scales but such a study is beyond the scope of the present paper and we shall leave this question apart in the following .      it is clear that the entanglement properties of the @xmath74 state are insensitive to the transformation @xmath75 .",
    "thus , as explained in appendix [ spectrum ] , one can , in this case , restrict our analysis to @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
