    "the kagome lattice structure , which consists of corner - sharing triangles , is notorious for supporting exotic states of matter .",
    "for instance , the possible experimental realization of quantum spin - liquids based on spin-1/2 kagome lattices has generated in the past intense research efforts on herbertsmithite and similar frustrated antiferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "recently , the kagome lattice has also received plenty of attention for quasiparticle excitations with non - trivial topology  @xcite . from topologically non - trivial electronic bands ,",
    "effects such as the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe )  @xcite and the quantum anomalous hall effect ( qahe )  @xcite can emerge , also in kagome lattices  @xcite .",
    "a quantum spin hall insulator in two dimensions , also known as a topological insulator , is a topological state of matter , present in a system with spin - orbit coupling , where symmetry protected dissipationless spin - polarized currents counterpropagate on the sample edges , while the bulk of the sample remains insulating ( fig .",
    "[ fig : halleffects]a ) .",
    "this phenomenon has received considerable attention because majorana bound states have been predicted to appear at interfaces between qshe materials and superconductors  @xcite . employing these majorana zero modes for topological quantum computation",
    "is a rapidly developing field  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the qshe , in a quantum anomalous hall insulator only one spin species propagates around the sample edge due to the presence of intrinsic magnetization in the sample ( fig .  [",
    "fig : halleffects]b ) .",
    "this state of matter offers a direct realization of _ intrinsic _ topological properties in a material through the combination of spin - orbit coupling and magnetism  @xcite . due to the dissipation - free , spin - polarized edge currents in the absence of external magnetic fields , realizations of the qahe",
    "are also intensively sought for , especially for application in new energy - efficient spintronic devices  @xcite .",
    "so far , in electronic systems the qahe has only been observed in thin films of chromium - doped ( bi , sb)@xmath0te@xmath1 at a temperature of @xmath2  @xcite , the main limitation being the low curie temperature of the material involved .",
    "lately , it has been proposed that the qahe can be realized in some other compounds using , for instance , manipulated surfaces or exfoliated monolayers  @xcite .",
    "another interesting approach is design from scratch of organometallic networks with topological bandstructures  @xcite .",
    "a good strategy for designing qahe compounds based on existing materials with favorable energy scales that are adequate for applications is however currently lacking .        here",
    ", we propose a new approach to create materials with non - trivial band topology and large curie temperatures , exploiting the electronic properties of doped mott insulators on a kagome lattice",
    ". a quick look at the one - electron properties ( bandstructure ) of the kagome lattice with nearest neighbor hoppings ( fig .",
    "[ fig : purekagomedosfilling ] ) shows huge potential for the realization of possible exotic states by only varying the electron filling . at half - filling",
    "the fermi level lies near a van hove singularity and inclusion of many - body correlation effects renders the system a mott insulator  @xcite . at a filling of @xmath3 , however , the mott transition is absent  @xcite and the fermi level is at the dirac point , where non - trivial band effects may be expected upon consideration of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling opens a gap at the position of the dirac point and the non - trivial topology of electrons on the kagome lattice leads to surface states of both spin species that traverse the bulk band gap opened by relativistic effects and , the qshe is realized .",
    "even more interesting is the filling of @xmath4 with the fermi level right at the flat band .",
    "it was recently suggested  @xcite that if a nearly flat band is partially filled , a proper combination of spin - orbit coupling , ferromagnetism and geometric frustration will give rise to the fractional quantum hall effect at high temperatures . along these lines , we exploit here as a key ingredient for topological non - trivial states , the tendency towards ferromagnetism  @xcite of a filled flat band in hole - doped transition - metal - based kagome lattices . at @xmath4",
    "the ferromagnetic instability combined with correlation effects is expected to gap out one spin - channel and move the fermi level of the other spin - channel exactly to the dirac point .",
    "when spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is considered , we have the same situation as for the filling of @xmath3 but only for one spin species .",
    "in such a situation , the qahe with fully spin - polarized dissipation - free surface states is realized .    to demonstrate this new strategy of finding qshe and qahe materials by doping mott insulators , we investigate which possible modifications of the natural mineral herbertsmithite -a mott insulator with spin - liquid behavior- leave the perfect kagome motif undistorted and realize different electronic fillings .",
    "herbertsmithite crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group @xmath5 and its structure is based on layers of cu@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) ions building a perfect two - dimensional half - filled frustrated kagome lattice separated by layers of zn@xmath6 ions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dopingenergies]a ) .",
    "the cu atoms are in a square planar crystal field environment of oxygen ions so that the orbitals near the fermi level are correlated @xmath8 states . evaluating density functional theory ( dft ) total energies ,",
    "we show that single crystals of materials obtained by following various doping choices in herbertsmithite can in principle be synthesized .",
    "further , we prove that the magnetic ground state of hole - doped herbertsmithite at filling @xmath9 is ferromagnetic , which validates that the flat band physics of the pure kagome lattice carries over to realistic situations .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the presence of topologically non - trivial surface states of doped herbertsmithite using a state - of - the - art wannier function technique based on fully relativistic dft calculations .",
    "we prepared hypothetical materials starting from the experimental crystal structure of herbertsmithite  @xcite , substituting zinc ( zn@xmath6 ) atoms between the copper kagome layers ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dopingenergies ] ) by monovalent @xmath10=li@xmath11 ,  na@xmath11 ( hole - doping ) and trivalent al@xmath12 ,  ga@xmath12 ,  in@xmath12 ,  sc@xmath12 ,  y@xmath12 ( electron - doping ) .",
    "we refer to these compounds as @xmath10-herbertsmithite , @xmath10cu@xmath1(oh)@xmath13cl@xmath0 .",
    "experimental and hypothetical crystal structures were fully relaxed using dft in the projector augmented wave ( paw ) formulation  @xcite implemented in gpaw  @xcite with a plane - wave cutoff of @xmath14 and the gga exchange - correlation functional  @xcite .",
    "we optimized the stoichiometric structures using @xmath15 @xmath16-points ( @xmath17 @xmath16-points for non - stoichiometric structures ) until forces were below @xmath18 .    for each of the substituted structures with perfect copper kagome layer we also constructed a defect structure , where we lowered the symmetry of the unit cell and exchanged the substituent @xmath10 with a copper atom from a kagome lattice site .",
    "as the chemical composition of these defect structures is identical to the defect - free structures , energy differences can be evaluated directly within dft . in case",
    "the defect structure has lower energy , the kagome lattice is likely to be destroyed and the phenomena of interest here will not arise in the target compound .",
    "total energies , electronic bandstructures and magnetic exchange interactions of the relaxed structures were then evaluated using _ ab - initio _ dft calculations within an all - electron full - potential local orbital ( fplo )  @xcite basis . for the exchange - correlation functional we employed the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite , as well as dft+u",
    "@xcite functionals .",
    "the latter was necessary in order to treat the correlated nature of cu 3@xmath19 orbitals .",
    "the hubbard repulsion on the cu 3@xmath19 orbitals was set to @xmath20 and hund s rule coupling to @xmath21 .",
    "although we concentrate our investigation on the cu @xmath8 orbitals close to the fermi level , the interactions were included in the entire cu 3@xmath19 shell , which is spread out over a large range of energies due to the interaction with the ligands . additionally , we investigated the effect of spin - orbit coupling on the electronic bandstructure employing the fully relativistic version of the fplo code .",
    "total energies , electronic bandstructures , tight - binding and heisenberg models were extracted from calculations converged using @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath15 @xmath16-point grids respectively .    to demonstrate the existence of surface states",

    "the spectral function is obtained from the green s function as @xmath26 .",
    "by performing exhaustive dft calculations we identified as the limiting factor for modifying herbertsmithite the tendency of certain ions towards substituting copper sites in the kagome layer . in fig .",

    "[ fig : purekagomedosfilling ] .",

    "the ferromagnetic instability places therefore the fermi level of the up spin bands right at the dirac point .    to show the presence of topologically protected edge states in doped herbertsmithite , we calculated the product of parity eigenvalues at eight inversion - symmetric points ( see fig .",

    "note that non - trivial band topology is intrinsic to the perfect kagome lattice  @xcite and no particular inversion of orbital weights is required unlike in most topological insulators  @xcite . in real materials",

    "[ fig : surfacestates]b ) .",
    "the spectral function of the dual surface ( triangles termination ) has the same essential features ( shown in the supplemental information ) .",

    "in this work we have presented a new generally applicable strategy for creating materials where the quantum anomalous hall effect and the quantum spin hall effect can be realized at affordable energy and temperature scales , based on existing kagome lattice mott insulators .    for the quantum anomalous hall effect we showed that if the fermi level is placed into the kagome flat band , the reconstructed bands are fully spin - polarized and show a topologically non - trivial gap at the fermi level with conducting surface states of only one spin species .",
    "we demonstrated our proposal by considering the kagome mott insulator herbertsmithite .",
    "although the kagome flat band is only nearly flat in the real system , a quantum anomalous hall state with curie temperature well above @xmath47 is established upon chemical substitution .",
    "the correlated nature of the cu @xmath48 orbitals plays an important role for the existence of fully spin - polarized bands with a gap to the empty minority bands .",
    "as we have been dealing with @xmath48 electrons , the calculated spin - orbit induced band gap is of the order of @xmath49 .",
    "our scheme is applicable to @xmath50 and @xmath51 systems , where significantly larger spin - orbit band gaps are to be expected , while still preserving some correlation effects .",
    "electron doping of herbertsmithite up to the dirac point yields , on the other hand , a topological insulator ( qshe ) . with the earlier prediction of superconductivity close to the dirac point  @xcite ,",
    "the ga@xmath27zn@xmath28-herbertsmithite system might present an interesting platform for building a topological quantum computer by locally controlling the ga : zn ratio .",
    "synthesis of such doped kagome systems may be a challenge . however , our calculations show a robust stability of the structures and correctly predict , for instance , that the cd - substituted herbertsmithite distorts , as has been observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "this gives some reassurance about the predictive power and actual realization of the phenomena proposed in the present work .",
    "nevertheless , chemical doping may not be the only route to achieve hole or electron doping in herbertsmithite . in recent years",
