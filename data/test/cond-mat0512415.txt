    "@xcite prototypical chaotic cavities ( such as the stadium and the sinai billiard ) do however feature geometrical symmetries that leave signatures on the transport properties , @xcite which we investigate in the present communication .",

    "these earlier works identified the correct invariant measure of the scattering matrix and they studied several statistical properties of the conductance . here",
    "we give the complete solution of this problem by deriving the joint probability density of transmission eigenvalues , which determine all stationary transport properties , for an arbitrary number of open channels supported by the leads attached to the quantum dot .",
    "the density of the transmission eigenvalues turns out to take a particularly simple form .",
    "a striking signature of the solution is the absence of any non trivial dependence of the ensemble - averaged conductance and shot noise on the number of open transport channels .",

    "throughout this paper we assume the absence of magnetic fields and spin - orbit scattering , hence , we consider time - reversal symmetric systems without kramers degeneracy .      as a benchmark for our results we use the well - established random - matrix theory for such systems in absence of any spatial symmetries @xcite",

    "@xcite similar corrections exist also for other transport properties such as the fano factor .",
    "generally , they can be related to deviations of @xmath33 from @xmath34 , and are most pronounced for a small number of channels .    for a single channel ( @xmath3 )",

    "hence the ensemble - averaged conductance is given by @xmath66 , i.e. , the weak - localization correction is absent .",
    "moreover the fano factor is given by @xmath67 .",
    "the absence of any @xmath0-dependent corrections is in striking contrast to the previously discussed case of asymmetric systems .",
    "the results above also apply to systems with a 180@xmath68 _ rotational _ symmetry mapping the leads onto each other .",
    "they can also be extended to incorporate further spatial symmetries which may be present in addition to the lead - transposing symmetry . for systems with two leads , the only remaining case is the fourfold symmetry as indicated in fig.[fig : systems]b . in this case , the @xmath69 matrix can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the scattering matrices associated with the even and odd channels , respectively .",
    "each matrix @xmath73 has the structure of eq .",
    "( [ s_symmetric ] ) ; thus each of them can be analyzed by the same procedure as in the previous lead - transposing symmetry case and the statistical transport properties are given by the superposition of the even and odd subsystems .",
    "for a cavity with a fourfold symmetry we therefore have @xmath74 and a constant fano factor @xmath75 .",
    "we now compare our theoretical results to numerical simulations of stadium billiards which feature the four different setups depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : systems ] .",
    "the numerical data is obtained by solving the schrdinger equation using a modular recursive green s function method which allows for an efficient calculation of the scattering matrix even for a large number of open channels .",
    "@xcite    the most drastic effects of the lead - transposing reflection symmetry are expected for the case of a single channel in the leads ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : systems ] compares the numerical probability distribution @xmath76 with the analytical predictions for the systems with and without a lead - transposing reflection symmetry ( see upper and lower panel , respectively ) .",
    "note that for each of the two pairs of geometries the numerical results ( i ) show a clear signature of the absence / presence of the symmetry and ( ii ) we can see a good agreement with the analytical predictions .",
    "several earlier studies have demonstrated that dynamical signatures of geometries can also be identified in terms of the fano factor .",
    "@xcite figure [ fano_180]a shows the fano factor for the symmetric geometries as a function of the number of channels . for the two systems with lead - transposing reflection symmetry our numerical simulations show an overall constant behavior of the fano factor with the number of channels , around @xmath77 , in agreement with our modified random - matrix theory .",
    "the modes of the left - right symmetric cavity in fig .",
    "1(a ) are identical to the modes with even index of the cavity in fig .",
    "1(b ) . therefore , the presence of the odd channels in our fourfold symmetric cavity does not change the statistical properties of the transmission eigenvalues as predicted above .",
    "the flat behavior of the fano factor in the symmetric cavities is nicely contrasted by the results for the two geometries without symmetry , fig .",
    "[ fano_180]b : as predicted by the conventional random - matrix theory ( absence of spatial symmetries ) the fano factor decreases as @xmath0 increases and approaches its universal value 1/4 for large @xmath0 .",

    "[ fig : systems]c can be explained in terms of the partial symmetry of short trajectories in the structure . ]",
    "note , however , that in fig .",
    "[ fano_180]b the fano factor of the geometry with the horizontally attached lead ( fig .",
    "[ fig : systems]c ) consistently lies above the rmt prediction for small channel numbers .",
    "this feature can be attributed to the fact that in this geometry a significant fraction of back - reflected classical tractories come in pairs of two equally long paths which are related to each other by an up - down mirror reflection .",
    "this feature does , however , not apply to those trajectories the mirror images of which are cut short by the exit lead ( see the two trajectory pairs in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : systems]c ) . since this `` partial '' symmetry enhances the constructive interference of reflected paths but spares all transmitted trajectories ,",
    "the weak localization contribution to the conductance and the shot noise power are increased . by tilting the entrance",
    "lead slightly ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : systems]d ) this effect should be destroyed , resulting in transport statistics which follow the rmt - prediction .",
    "checking with our numerical data in fig .",
    "[ fano_180 ] we note that this assessment is indeed nicely corroborated . given this excellent agreement",
    ", one might wonder why recently proposed corrections to rmt due to `` noiseless scattering channels '' @xcite do not apply in the present cases . due to the small ratio of lead width @xmath79 to cavity area @xmath80 in our geometries ( see caption fig .  [",
    "fig : systems ] ) the criterion for the emergence of such fully transmitted or reflected channels , @xmath81 , @xcite is , however , not fulfilled in the energy regimes studied above ( for the highest energy considered here : @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) .",
    "we have studied analytically and numerically the effects of spatial symmetries on electronic transport properties of ballistic lateral quantum dots , modeled by a quantum chaotic cavity . especially , we considered geometries with a symmetry which maps the two leads onto each other .",
    "for such systems , random - matrix theory can be solved exactly for an arbitrary number of channels @xmath0 in each lead .",
    "we predict that finite-@xmath0 corrections are absent for all transport quantities , such as the conductance and the shot noise .",
    "this is confirmed by our numerical simulations .",
    "we further explored the effects of partial symmetries on transport which , as we showed , can yield significant corrections to the random - matrix predictions .",
