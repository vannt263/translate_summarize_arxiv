    "recent observations of the cosmic microwave background ( @xmath0 ) and of the large scale structure of the universe ( @xmath3 ) have led to the definition of a concordance cosmological model .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath0 temperature data over the whole celestial sphere from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( @xmath4 ) satellite experiment has been playing a dominant role in designing this precise picture of the universe @xcite . according to this model , the cosmic structures and the @xmath0 originate from gaussian adiabatic perturbations seeded in the early phase of inflation of the universe .",
    "however , cosmological scenarios motivated by theories for the unification of the fundamental interactions predict the existence of topological defects , resulting from phase transitions at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "these defects would have participated to the formation of the cosmic structures , also imprinting the @xmath0 .",
    "cosmic strings are a line - like version of such defects which are also predicted in the framework of fundamental string theory @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the issue of their existence is a central question in cosmology today .",
    "cosmic strings are parametrized by a string tension @xmath5 , i.e. a mass per unit length , which sets the overall strength of a string network .",
    "their main signature in the @xmath0 is characterized by temperature steps along the string positions .",
    "this localized effect , known as the kaiser - stebbins ( @xmath1 ) effect @xcite , hence implies a non - gaussian imprint of the string network in the @xmath0 .",
    "the most numerous strings appear at an angular size around @xmath6 @xmath7 on the celestial sphere .",
    "@xmath0 experiments with an angular resolution much below @xmath6 @xmath7 are thus required in order to resolve the width of cosmic strings .",
    "experimental constraints have been obtained on a possible string contribution in terms of upper bounds on the string tension @xmath5 @xcite . in this context , even though observations largely fit with an origin of the cosmic structures in terms of adiabatic perturbations , room is still available for the existence of cosmic strings .",
    "the observed @xmath0 signal can be modeled as a linear superposition of a statistically isotropic but non - gaussian string signal @xmath8 proportional to an unknown string tension , with statistically isotropic gaussian noise @xmath9 comprising the standard components of the @xmath0 induced by adiabatic perturbations , as well as instrumental noise . in a first recent work @xcite we developed an effective method for mapping the string network potentially imprinted in @xmath0 temperature data , in the perspective of forthcoming arcminute resolution experiments performing a mapping of planar patches of the sky in real space , with standard radiometers .",
    "we took a bayesian approach to this denoising problem , based on statistical models for both the string signal and the noise .",
    "the denoising is done in the wavelet domain , using a steerable wavelet transform well adapted for representing the strongly oriented features present in the string signal .",
    "we showed that the string signal coefficients are well modeled by generalized gaussian distributions ( @xmath10 s ) , which are fitted at each wavelet scale using a training simulation borrowed from the set of realistic string simulations recently produced by @xcite .    in the present work we aim at extending the approach described above to the reconstruction of a string signal from radio - interferometric observations of the @xmath0 probing small patches of the celestial sphere at the same arcminute resolution .",
    "under the most standard assumptions , radio interferometers provide a noisy and incomplete fourier coverage of the planar signal . in these terms",
    ", the signal reconstruction amounts to solving an ill - posed inverse problem encompassing both denoising and deconvolution . relying on the @xmath1 effect in the @xmath0 ,",
    "the string network itself can be mapped by the magnitude of the gradient @xmath11 of the string signal , which is very sparse or compressible in nature , with significant amplitudes only along the strings themselves .",
    "the theory of compressed sensing offers a new framework for solving ill - posed inverse problem when the signals are sparse or compressible @xcite .",
    "a band - limited signal may be expressed as the @xmath12-dimensional vector of its values sampled at the nyquist - shannon rate . by definition ,",
    "a signal is sparse in some basis if its expansion contains only a small number @xmath13 of non - zero coefficients .",
    "more generally it is compressible if its expansion only contains a small number of significant coefficients , i.e. if a large number of its coefficients bear a negligible value .",
    "the theory of compressed sensing demonstrates that , for sparse or compressible signals , a small number @xmath14 of random measurements , in a sensing basis incoherent with the sparsity basis , will suffice for an accurate and stable reconstruction of the signals .",
    "the mutual coherence between two bases may be defined as the maximum complex modulus of the scalar product between unit - norm vectors of the two bases .",
    "a random selection of fourier measurements of a signal sparse in real space or in its gradient are particular examples of good sensing procedures . in this framework",
    ", the reconstruction of the signals may be approached in different ways , but all of them encompass a regularization of the ill - posed inverse problem by the introduction of a sparsity or compressibility constraint . in a second recent work @xcite , we presented results showing that compressed sensing offers powerful image reconstruction techniques for radio - interferometric data , which are stable relative to noise , as well as stable relative to non - exact sparsity , i.e. compressibility of the signals .",
    "these techniques are based on global minimization problems , which are solved by convex optimization algorithms @xcite .",
    "we particularly illustrated the versatility of the scheme relative to the inclusion of specific prior information on the signal in the minimization problems .",
    "we here wish to apply these results for the reconstruction of a string signal in the @xmath0 . as for the denoising algorithm proposed in @xcite , the reconstruction algorithm that we present",
    "may be considered as a modular component of a larger data analysis .",
    "it may notably find use as a pre - processing step for other methods for cosmic string detection based on explicit edge detection @xcite .",
    "our reconstruction algorithm is tested under different conditions with astrophysical noise components including various contributions to the standard components of the @xmath0 , i.e. primary and secondary anisotropies .",
    "our analyses rely on the set of realistic string simulations recently produced by @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : string signal and noise ] , we discuss the string signal and noise in the @xmath0 . in section [ sec : interferometric inverse problem ] , we describe the inverse problem posed in the context of radio interferometry . in section [ sec : compressed sensing reconstruction ] , we define the minimization problems to be solved for signal reconstruction in the context of compressed sensing , notably relying on a prior statistical model of the string signal fitted from simulations . in section [ sec : analyses and results ] , we describe our numerical analyses and results . we finally conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the string signal in the @xmath0 , as well as the astrophysical noise made up of the standard primary and secondary anisotropies .",
    "we also describe the numerical simulations used for our subsequent analyses .      in an inflationary cosmological model ,",
    "the phase transitions responsible for the formation of a cosmic string network occur after the end of inflation , so as to produce observable defects . from the epoch of last scattering until today",
    ", the cosmic string network continuously imprints the @xmath0 .",
    "the so - called scaling solution for the string network implies that the most numerous strings are imprinted just after last scattering and have a typical angular size around @xmath6 @xmath7 , of the order of the horizon size at that time @xcite .",
    "longer strings are also imprinted in the later stages of the universe evolution , but in smaller number , according to the number of corresponding horizon volumes required to fill the sky .",
    "the main signature of a cosmic string in the @xmath0 is described by the @xmath1 effect according to which a temperature step is induced along the string position .",
    "the relative amplitude of this step is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 standing for the string velocity transverse to the line of sight and @xmath19 for the speed of light , and where @xmath20 is a dimensionless parameter uniquely associated with the string tension @xmath5 through @xmath21 with @xmath22 standing for the gravitational constant . in the following we call @xmath20 the string tension .",
    "on small angular scales , realistic simulations can be produced by stacking @xmath0 maps induced in different redshift ranges between last scattering and today .",
    "the simulations that we use in this work have been produced by this technique @xcite .",
    "the string signal is understood as a realization of a statistically isotropic but non - gaussian process on the celestial sphere with an overall amplitude rescaled by the string tension @xmath20 , and characterized by a nearly scale - free angular power spectrum : @xmath23 , where the positive integer index @xmath24 stands for the angular frequency index on the sphere .",
    "an analytical expression of this spectrum was provided for @xmath24 larger than a few hundreds by @xcite , on the basis of their simulations .",
    "we consider radio - interferometric @xmath0 observations with a small field of view corresponding to an angular opening @xmath25 on the celestial sphere . in this context",

    ", the radial component identifies with the angular frequency on the celestial sphere , below some band limit @xmath30 set by the resolution of the interferometer under consideration : @xmath31 . for @xmath29 larger than a few hundreds , the nearly scale - free planar power spectrum of the string signal @xmath32 reads as : @xmath33 with @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "the observed @xmath0 signal can be understood as a linear superposition of the string signal and statistically isotropic noise of astrophysical and instrumental origin @xmath36 with some angular power spectrum @xmath37 . in the euclidean limit",
    ", the corresponding planar power spectrum for the noise @xmath36 may be written as @xmath38 for @xmath35 .",

    "the spectrum of the string signal is represented for a string tension @xmath41 in terms of its analytical expression valid at high angular frequencies ( red straight line ) .",
    "the noise spectra ( ordered by decreasing amplitude at low angular frequencies ) are : the primary @xmath0 anisotropies ( black solid line ) and the gravitational lensing correction ( black dashed line ) , the thermal @xmath42 effect in the rayleigh - jeans limit ( blue solid line ) , the non - linear kinetic @xmath42 effect ( green solid line ) , and the ostriker - vishniac effect ( magenta solid line).,width=302 ]    current @xmath0 experiments achieve an angular resolution on the celestial sphere of the order of @xmath43 arcminutes , corresponding to a limit angular frequency not far above @xmath44 . at such resolutions ,",
    "the standard components of the @xmath0 primarily contain the statistically isotropic and gaussian primary anisotropies induced by adiabatic perturbations at last scattering . in this context",
    ", any possible string signal is confined to amplitudes largely dominated by these primary anisotropies .",
    "the constraints mainly come from a best fit analysis of the angular power spectrum of the overall @xmath0 signal in the @xmath4 temperature data @xcite .",
    "the tightest of these constraints @xcite gives the following upper bound at @xmath45 per cent confidence level : @xmath46    forthcoming experiments will provide access to higher angular resolution . among other instruments , radio interferometers such as the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) will probe the @xmath0 at angular resolutions below @xmath6 @xmath47 @xcite . at these resolutions , the secondary @xmath0 anisotropies induced by interaction of @xmath0 photons with the evolving universe after last scattering will dominate the primary anisotropies , and must be accounted for",
    ".    the primary anisotropies exhibit exponential damping at high angular frequencies .",
    "this contrasts with the slow decay of the nearly scale - free angular power spectrum of the string signal , which thus dominates over the primary anisotropies at high enough angular frequencies .",
    "the secondary anisotropies include gravitational effects such as the integrated sachs - wolfe ( @xmath48 ) effect , the rees - sciama ( @xmath49 ) effect , and gravitational lensing , as well as re - scattering effects such as the thermal and kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich ( @xmath42 ) effects .",
    "the @xmath42 effects dominate these secondary anisotropies @xcite . the @xmath48 and @xmath49 effects associated with the time evolution of the standard gravitational potentials can be neglected at these angular frequencies .",
    "one may thus restrict the secondary anisotropies considered in the noise to the linear ( ostriker - vishniac ) and non - linear kinetic @xmath42 effects , as well as the thermal @xmath42 effect .",
    "the @xmath42 effects are actually non - gaussian , spatially dependent , and the kinetic and thermal effects are correlated . as a simplifying assumption , we treat these two effects as two independent statistically isotropic gaussian noise components .",
    "the effect of gravitational lensing is very small relative to the @xmath42 effects , but we still take it into account as a correction to the angular power spectrum of the primary anisotropies .    at arcminute resolution ,",
    "the thermal and kinetic @xmath42 effects have standard deviations around @xmath43 and @xmath50 @xmath51 respectively .",
    "they also have a slow decay at high angular frequencies and will dominate the string signal for string tension values below the current experimental upper bound .",
    "arcminute @xmath0 experiments are in fact primarily dedicated to the detection of these secondary anisotropies . unlike the other effects considered , which have the same black body spectrum as the primary anisotropies , the thermal @xmath42 effect on the @xmath0 temperature depends on the frequency of observation .",
    "its amplitude decreases between the rayleigh - jeans limit ( null frequency ) and @xmath52 @xmath53 where it is expected to vanish , before increasing again at higher frequencies .",

    "these spectra are explicitly borrowed from @xcite .    in this context , the performance of the reconstruction algorithm to be defined will be studied in the following limits . in a first noise condition , we will consider the secondary anisotropies as a statistically isotropic gaussian noise , with power spectrum given by the rayleigh - jeans limit , that is added to the primary anisotropies . in a second noise condition , we will also assume an observation frequency around @xmath52 @xmath53 taking advantage of the frequency dependence of the thermal @xmath42 effect , and include in the noise secondary anisotropies in absence of this effect .",

    ", the major interest of the analysis actually resides in the comparison of the standard @xmath183 algorithm with the @xmath131 and @xmath132 algorithms .",
    "firstly , the reconstructions illustrated in figure [ fig : pa - in - rec ] seem very similar for @xmath183 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",
    "note however that the magnitude of the gradient of the original signal ( not shown on the figure ) re - multiplied by the primary beam lies roughly in the range [ @xmath192 .",
    "the range of amplitudes reported on the maps therefore indicate that the dynamic range of the reconstructions is better for @xmath131 than for @xmath183 , and even better for @xmath132 .",
    "this is a generic behaviour that can be observed in all noise and coverage conditions and at all string tensions .",
    "secondly , as shown in figure [ fig : stat ] in all noise conditions and for a coverage at @xmath72 per cent , the eye visibility thresholds identify with the string tension where the @xmath176 and correlation coefficient get down to very small values , and the kurtosis exhibits a large variability over the @xmath69 simulations around the expected value .",
    "this allows us to identify rigorously the eye visibility threshold as the string tension below which the algorithms are not effective anymore at recovering the string network .",
    "thirdly , as also shown in figure [ fig : stat ] in all noise conditions and for a coverage at @xmath72 per cent , the @xmath176 and correlation coefficient are always significantly larger for @xmath131 than for @xmath183 .",
    "they are always at least as good for @xmath132 as for @xmath131 and often significantly larger .",
    "however , it appears that the kurtosis is less optimally recovered with @xmath131 than with @xmath183 .",
    "but the @xmath132 approach regularizes the kurtosis significantly better than @xmath183 in most cases .",
    "note that these last two conclusions also hold for a @xmath107 per cent coverage , hence suggesting their stability and robustness relative to the coverage .",
    "the reconstruction performance is always significantly better at @xmath107 per cent than at @xmath72 per cent , but the improvement is not drastic .",
    "this suggests that a small number of visibilities can already lead to good reconstructions of the string signal .",
    "in the perspective of the evaluation of the performance of the reconstruction algorithms , it is natural to ask whether the requirement for a complete reconstruction of the signal strongly limits the lowest string tension accessible in comparison with the lowest detectable string tension on the basis of the psm .    in this regard , for any possible string tension @xmath20",
    ", the probability distribution for the estimate @xmath169 on the basis of the psm may be obtained from simulations .",
    "one can identify the critical value @xmath193 such that , for null string tension , the probability that the estimate @xmath169 is larger than @xmath193 is small : @xmath194 , for some suitable positive value @xmath195 much smaller than unity .",
    "the test for the hypothesis of null string tension is then defined as follows .",
    "for estimated values @xmath196 , the hypothesis of null string tension may be rejected with a significance level @xmath195 . on the contrary for estimated values @xmath197 , the hypothesis of null string tension may not be rejected .",
    "we define the psm detectability threshold @xmath198 such that , for the string tension @xmath198 , the probability that the estimate @xmath169 is larger than @xmath193 is large : @xmath199 , for some suitable positive value @xmath200 much smaller than unity .",
    "consequently , for string tensions larger than @xmath198 , the probability of rejecting a null string tension on the basis of the hypothesis test defined is larger than @xmath201 , called the power of the test .",
    "the value @xmath198 is the smallest string tension that can be discriminated from the hypothesis of null string tension for given values of significance and power of the test .",
    "it may thus be understood as a detectability threshold determined on the basis of the psm .",
    "the psm detectability thresholds in the various noise and coverage conditions considered are reported in table [ tab : detectionthresholds ] for @xmath202 . in the noise condition @xmath56 , detectability thresholds are well below the experimental upper bound , while for the noise conditions @xmath55 and @xmath54 they are respectively of the same order and larger . in all cases ,",
    "the psm detectability threshold @xmath203 is only slightly below the eye visibility threshold associated with the reconstruction algorithms discussed , by a factor smaller than @xmath204 .",
    "this discrepancy between these two thresholds confirms that the detection problem alone can be solved with the psm only down to slightly lower string tensions than the more difficult reconstruction problem .",
    "as already emphasized in @xcite , it is one thing to estimate a single global parameter such as the string tension on the basis of a psm , but quite another to explicitly reconstruct the string network itself .",
    "these comparison results are thus already very positive .",
    "our results strongly support the idea of the superiority of the compressed sensing approaches for a string signal reconstruction from radio - interferometric data , in particular when specific statistical prior information is introduced in the global minimization problem defined for reconstruction .",
    "however , at the high angular resolution considered and in the noise condition @xmath54 , the eye visibility thresholds , as well as the psm detectability thresholds , are above the current best experimental upper bound on the string tension .",
    "one first approach to circumvent this difficulty in the perspective of the reconstruction of a possible string network from forthcoming radio - interferometric observations is to consider an observation frequency around @xmath52 @xmath53 so as to eliminate the thermal @xmath42 effect and to fall in the noise condition @xmath55 .",
    "but even in this case the eye visibility thresholds remain slightly higher than the experimental upper bound .    in this context , recent work by the authors might help to drastically enhance the signal reconstruction performance in the context of compressed sensing approaches @xcite .",
    "radio interferometers with small field of view and baselines with non - negligible and constant component in the pointing direction should be considered . in this context",
    ", the visibilities measured essentially identify with a noisy and incomplete fourier coverage of the product of the planar signal multiplied by the primary beam with a linear chirp modulation .",
    "theoretical and numerical results show the universality of the corresponding spread spectrum phenomenon relative to the sparsity basis , in terms of the achievable quality of reconstruction through global minimization problems such as @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "preliminary numerical results regarding the application of such a framework to the reconstruction of a string signal in the @xmath0 look very promising .    in another line of thoughts ,",
    "global component separation techniques might be envisaged in order to simultaneously extract all non - gaussian components of the @xmath0 temperature data , including the @xmath42 effects and the string signal .",
    "finally , let us recall that the string signal simulations used for modelling the prior statistical distribution of the signal gradient as @xmath10 s and for computing its power spectrum are realistic .",
    "nevertheless , further analysis should be performed in order to study the stability of the @xmath132 reconstruction quality relative to a discrepancy between the statistical distribution of the true signal and our model . analyzing the difference between the @xmath131 and @xmath132 reconstruction qualities",
    "already provides useful information in that respect , as the @xmath131 minimization problem captures the essence of the compressiblity of the signal gradient , but with a non - exact @xmath10 shape parameter @xmath149 . in this context",
    ", one can argue in favour of a relative stability of the reconstruction quality in terms of the @xmath176 and correlation coefficient as these measures are indeed smaller for @xmath131 than for @xmath132 , but still larger than for @xmath183 .",
    "this stability is lost in terms of the kurtosis though .",
    "the @xmath132 algorithm proposed for the reconstruction of a string signal from arcminute resolution radio - interferometric data of the @xmath0 is designed in the framework of compressed sensing .",
    "it notably relies on a model of the prior statistical distribution of the signal , fitted on the basis of realistic simulations .",
    "the algorithm shows superior performance relative to the standard @xmath183 algorithm .",
