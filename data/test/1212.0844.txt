    "the energy changes associated to processes occurring in mesoscopic objects exhibit a stochastic nature due to the effect of fluctuations .",
    "this implies that for single trajectories in phase space , thermodynamic observables like work , heat , and entropy changes are random quantities .",
    "this fact constitutes the basis for stochastic thermodynamics  @xcite . in this context , the stochastic entropy produced during a certain protocol can be negative for certain rare trajectories , a fact that is in apparent contradiction with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "fluctuation theorems  @xcite state that those trajectories where the entropy production is negative occur with an exponentially small weight in comparison to the trajectories where the entropy production is positive @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents a transformation like time - reversal , or the transformation to a _ dual _ dynamics , or their composition ( see  @xcite for a simple definition of the dual dynamics ) , and @xmath9 represents a trajectory - dependent thermodynamic quantity , as work , heat , or more generally , different forms of trajectory - dependent entropy production , with the symmetry @xmath10 .",
    "these relations , initially proved for deterministic and stochastic markovian systems , have also been extended to the case of non - markovian dynamics  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they have been widely tested in experiments  @xcite .",
    "eq.([dft ] ) is commonly denominated a detailed fluctuation theorem ( dft ) . from it",
    ", the relation @xmath11 , also known as an integral fluctuation theorem ( ift ) , can be obtained . from the ift and jensen s inequality ,",
    "the second law of thermodynamics is obtained as @xmath12 , independently of the protocol and the duration of the process .",
    "very large systems , where @xmath13 , naturally suppress fluctuations since the mean value of @xmath9 grows as @xmath1 for large @xmath1 , while fluctuations grow as @xmath14 , a fact that we know from the most elementary courses of statistical mechanics . in this case @xmath15 , which means that for any realization of any process one has @xmath16 .",
    "however , in small mesoscopic systems , fluctuations are large and realizations are possible such that @xmath17 for not too large time intervals . using some abuse of language",
    "( see for instance  @xcite ) , we can name these intervals as _ local violations of the second law of thermodynamics _ , where `` local '' means at a single trajectory level .",
    "we remark that the aforementioned local violations do not represent true violations of the second law of thermodynamics , which is , perhaps , the most solid law of nature .",
    "the entropy production remains always non - negative in average , however , it is interesting to characterize the statistics of the total time of occurrence of these events . in particular ,",
    "if we consider a time interval @xmath18 $ ] , we will be interested in calculating the total fraction of time @xmath0 where the stochastic entropy production is negative , which we name as the _ violation fraction_.    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we sketch the evolution of the entropy change as a function of time for a stochastic trajectory of a small system .",
    "the shadowed regions are the violation sectors ( where @xmath17 ) and the cumulative duration of these regions divided by the total time @xmath2 defines the fraction @xmath0 .     is defined as the relative duration of the violation sectors ( where @xmath17 ) with respect to the total time @xmath2 . ]",
    "this study is important in those cases where one only needs to consider a small number of realizations of a given process at the mesoscopic level .",
    "the entropy production is a self - averaging quantity , which implies that for single realizations in macroscopic systems one is already observing the averaged entropy production .",
    "that is why , in spite of the fact that the second law of thermodynamics forbids the spontaneous emergence of order from disorder in isolated systems _ only in average _ , we meet this limitation _ at every single realization _ of the given process .",
    "this is clearly not the picture at the mesoscopic scale , where this constraint is relaxed at single trajectories , and order can sometimes emerge from disorder .    additionally , our theory may be relevant in some other practical situations .",
    "for example , it is known that the efficiency of any thermal machine is bounded by virtue of the second law of thermodynamics . however ,",
    "if one optimizes the external protocols and accomodates the values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 such that the average violation fraction exhibits its larger possible value , our motor will operate in a scenario where the occurrence of entropy - consuming trajectories is especially propitious , a fact that could enhance the efficiency of the machine .",
    "this possibility will be considered in more detail in future works .    before proceeding , we would like to advance our main result .",
    "for the generic kind of systems we will consider in this work , the mean violation fraction exhibits , at large times , the simple behavior @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a model - dependent function of @xmath1 which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit as @xmath21 , with @xmath22 a non - universal , model - dependent constant , and @xmath23 , an exponent which depends on the particular form of the protocol .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we pose our problem and introduce the main concepts we need to tackle it . in section [ sec : main ] , we prove our main result .",
    "later , we study the illustrative case of a linear chain of harmonic oscillators driven at a constant rate by an anharmonic trap in section [ sec : chain ] .",
    "we briefly discuss how the strong fluctuations around a continuous phase transition may lead to a failure of the derived scaling law in section [ sec : phase - transition ] . finally , we present some conclusions and future projections of this work in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in order to characterize the local violations of the second law of thermodynamic associated to generic processes occurring in mesoscopic systems , we have to study the zero - crossings properties of the stochastic entropy production @xmath24 .",
    "an important quantity is the residence time , which is defined as the amount of time , up to time @xmath2 , that a given stochastic process @xmath25 spends in the semi - space @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 ) .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) for this quantity is closely related to the persistence , e.g. the probability that the process does not cross the line @xmath28 up to time @xmath2",
    "@xcite , which has been studied in many different contexts .",
    "for example , in  @xcite it has been used to characterize the ordering dynamics of the ising model ( where the process @xmath25 is the global or local magnetization ) , while in  @xcite it has been used to characterize the zero - crossings properties of a diffusing field starting from random initial conditions ( @xmath25 is the value of the diffusing field at a fixed point in space , as a function of time ) .    generally speaking ,",
    "the computation of the full pdf of the residence time for a given stochastic process is a difficult task , even when the process is markovian . in our case , we choose @xmath29 to be a stochastic entropy production ( see definitions below ) which is generally non - markovian even if the system performs markov dynamics . since an exact determination of the full pdf for arbitrary protocols and energy landscapes is out of order ,",
    "we focus in deriving some general results for the first moment of this pdf , the average violation fraction .",
    "this means that the results presented here are expected to be robust upon variations in the hamiltonian of the system , as long as these changes do not affect the main assumptions we use in our derivation , which we now discuss .",
    "we consider ergodic , microreversible , and extensive systems driven by a set of external , well controled parameters ( which we denote by @xmath30 ) .",
    "we point out that ergodicity and microreversibility ( the latter for the closed system composed by the system under study and its environment ) are minimal conditions for fluctuation relations to hold . on the other hand , in order to guarantee the extensivity of the thermodynamic observables , it is reasonable to assume that the interactions among the different particles in the system are short - ranged .    for constant protocols ,",
    "the system is able to reach a unique steady - state characterized by the pdf @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 denotes a configuration in the phase space .",
    "@xmath32 may be a single variable , a vector , or a field as well .",

    "furthermore , we assume that the system is initially prepared in the steady - state corresponding to @xmath33 , and for simplicity we assume that the system is connected to a single thermal bath .",
    "a more general analysis , considering several reservoirs , will be published elsewhere .",
    "we introduce the process @xmath24 as follows @xmath34 which depends on the particular trajectory of the system in the phase - space during its evolution .",
    "the time instant @xmath35 should be considered as an arbitrary point inside the interval @xmath18 $ ] , where the violation fraction will be measured .",
    "we also remark that @xmath2 can be choosen arbitrarily .    for equilibrium steady - states",

    "an open challenge is to derive a symmetry for the full pdf of the violation fraction in a more general context , relaxing the necessity of special initial conditions , allowing the system to be connected to several baths and considering arbitrary forms of entropy production , and not only the one considered here .",
    "some of these issues are the subject of a separate paper  @xcite .",

    "rgg would like to specially thank vivien lecomte for his valuable observations during the different stages of this work ."

    "<S> we define the _ violation fraction _ @xmath0 as the cumulative fraction of time that the entropy change is negative during single realizations of processes in phase space . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity depends both on the number of degrees of freedom @xmath1 and the duration of the time interval @xmath2 . in the large-@xmath2 and large-@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> limit we show that , for ergodic and microreversible systems , the mean value of @xmath0 scales as @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath4 is positive and generally depends on the protocol for the external driving forces , being @xmath5 for a constant drive . as an example , we study a nontrivial model where the fluctuations of the entropy production are non - gaussian : an elastic line driven at a constant rate by an anharmonic trap . in this case we show that the scaling of @xmath6 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 agrees with our result . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss how this scaling law may break down in the vicinity of a continuous phase transition . </S>"
