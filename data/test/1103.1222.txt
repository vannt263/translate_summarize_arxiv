    "interacting systems often exhibit phase transitions into permanently arrested , absorbing states in non - equilibrium ( neq ) steady states @xcite .",
    "intense efforts have been devoted to classifying these neq phase transitions into distinct universality classes , which is one of the most fundamental issues in the neq statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "although the guiding principles for the classification are still lacking in general , symmetry is undoubtedly one of the crucial ingredients in the classification . in the most prominent universality class known as the directed percolation ( dp ) class @xcite , systems possess either a single absorbing state or multiple ones not connected by any underlying symmetry @xcite .",
    "another newly established class known as the generalized voter ( gv ) universality class @xcite encompasses a large variety of models possessing two symmetric absorbing states , including statistical models for the social dynamics such as opinion spreading @xcite .",
    "this universality class embraces most of one dimensional models belonging to the so called directed ising class , such as neq kinetic ising model @xcite , interacting monomer - dimer ( imd ) model @xcite , and the voter model with spin - exchange @xcite .",
    "a fundamental and unique feature of the gv class is that , due to the symmetry of the absorbing states , the models in the class actually involve two types of phase transitions , namely , the @xmath0 symmetry breaking ( sb ) order - disorder and the active - absorbing phase transitions . in one dimension , the coincidence of these two transitions appears to be inevitable since the sb should be induced by the absorbing transition . in two dimensions ,",
    "the models belonging to the gv class are shown to exhibit two types of behaviors as follows .",
    "the sb order - disorder transition and the active - absorbing transition can take place simultaneously at a single critical point @xcite , where the defect density shows a logarithmic decay , as in the original voter model @xcite . close but",
    "separate occurrence of these two transitions is also observed @xcite . continuum field theoretic descriptions unifying these two types of behavior were formulated via appropriate langevin equations for the local order parameter field @xcite .",
    "we here present an extensive simulation study on the imd model with nearest neighbor ( nn ) repulsion on a square lattice .",
    "we observe that the two transitions are occurring successively at close but clearly distinct points .",
    "moreover , we find that the sb transition reveals a new _ non - ising _ critical behavior , and that the absorbing transition exhibits a dp - critical behavior ( due to the @xmath0-sb ) , that is , the density of active sites , @xmath1 , shows a power - law decay in time as @xmath2 with @xmath3 , in agreement with the corresponding dp exponent in two dimensions .",
    "interestingly , we further find that the entire absorbing phase becomes _ critical _ in the sense that the same power - law relaxation of @xmath1 persists even deep in the absorbing phase . in previous works for the microscopic models belonging to the gv class",
    ", we feel that the nature of the sb transition was presumed to be of pure ising type , and thus was not carefully studied so far : the binder cumulants associated with the sb transition took the values @xmath4 @xcite or @xmath5 @xcite , smaller than the universal ising value @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the pure ising nature of the sb transition in the corresponding continuum langevin description was reported though explicit results are not shown @xcite .",
    "our findings thus call for further studies on these microscopic models belonging to the gv universality class , and on the corresponding langevin equations .",
    "further related discussions are given below .",
    "here we consider the imd model with nn repulsion between the same type of particles , which is an interesting variant of the original ziff - gulari - barshad s catalytic surface - reaction model @xcite . a monomer ( denoted by a ) adsorbs on a ( randomly selected ) vacant site with free adsorption - attempt probability @xmath7 . likewise",
    "a dimer ( denoted by bb ) adsorbs on two ( randomly selected ) nn vacant sites with free adsorption - attempt probability @xmath8 .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is the single parameter in the present model .",
    "adsorbed dimer is assumed to instantly dissociate into two monomers . in two dimensions ,",
    "one has to carefully implement the kinetic rules respecting the constraint of nn repulsion : ( a ) monomer a adsorbs on a vacant site only if its nn sites are completely empty or have one or more b s regardless of the presence of a. adsorbed a then reacts with one of the nn b s to form the molecule ( ab ) which leaves the system .",
    "( b ) likewise , dimer bb adsorbs on two vacant nn sites only if their six nn sites satisfy one of the following conditions : ( 1 ) they are completely vacant .",
    "( 2 ) they have one or more a s in the three left - half ( lh ) nn sites , and at the same time have no b in the three right - half ( rh ) nn sites , and the vice versa .",
    "( 3 ) they have one or more a s on both the lh and rh nn sites , regardless of the presence of b. the system thus has the two symmetric absorbing states : anti - ferromagnetic ( af) arrangements of vacant sites and a s .     is smaller than the universal value @xmath6 for the eq two dimensional ising model.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",

    "note again that the scaling breaks down for the ising value @xmath54 and @xmath29 , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "therefore , we get @xmath55 and @xmath40 .    to further check the non - ising nature of the sb transition , we obtain the critical exponent @xmath56 from the _ dynamic _ order - parameter correlation function @xmath57 measured during the critical coarsening process ensued by a quench from an initial vacuum state to the sb critical point in a large system with @xmath58 , which does not involve the data collapse of fss method .",

    "although we do not have a solid theoretical argument for the observed non - ising behavior , the af ising - like domain morphology appears to provide a crucial qualitative hint for the non - ising nature of the sb transition ( see fig .",
    "7 ) . in the present model ,",
    "the two symmetric absorbing states correspond to the checkerboard pattern of the monomer a s due to the nn repulsion and neq nature of dynamic rules .",
    "one distinct feature in the present model is the presence of the dimers .",
    "we can see that the existence of the dimers induces ( via dynamic rules ) longer ranged effective repulsion interactions between the monomers , creating wide vacant regions percolating through the system ( see fig .",
    "7 ) . from the viewpoint of the af order ,",
    "these vacant regions contain densely packed defects , and must contain many b elements as well within them .",
    "these defects as well as b s are expected to divergingly fluctuate in their numbers at the sb transition .",
    "quite probably it is the existence of these defects and b elements ( with their diverging fluctuations ) that causes the non - ising critical behavior of the sb transition .",
    "for example , it is rather clear that these defects and b s can play a crucial role such that the spatial correlation of the af order parameter exhibits more rapid algebraic decay compared to the pure ising case at the sb transition .",
    "our preliminary results for the number fluctuation of the defects indeed indicates that it diverges at the sb transition , and its presentation is deferred to a later publication . here",
    "we present only the number fluctuations of the b element , i.e. , @xmath76 $ ] at the sb transition .",
    "we indeed find that this quantity also exhibits a diverging behavior at the sb transition , though much weaker one than the staggered magnetization fluctuations @xmath42 , as shown in fig .",

    "the absorbing transition point is estimated to be @xmath90 , at which @xmath91 exhibits a power law relaxation @xmath92 with @xmath3 ( dotted line denotes a line with the slope -0.45 ) .",
    "the same power - law relaxation is observed to persist within the absorbing phase.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in the present model , the sb and the absorbing transitions are split , and the former occurs within the active phase ( as shown in fig .",
    "9 ) , and the full af order is achieved only within the absorbing phase . by monitoring the relaxation of the dimer density @xmath91 , the order parameter of the absorbing transition , for various @xmath7 s , as shown in fig .",
    "9 , we obtain an estimate for the absorbing transition point as @xmath93 where the dimer density @xmath91 exhibits a power law decay @xmath92 with @xmath3 .",
    "this exponent is the same as that in the two - dimensional dp absorbing transition , which indicates that the absorbing transition occurring at @xmath94 belongs to the dp universality class .",
    "this behavior is in accord with the expectation @xcite that the the critical behavior is of dp class if the @xmath0 symmetry of the absorbing state is broken .",
    "remarkably , the same critical relaxation of the dimer density is observed to persist even within the entire absorbing phase ( @xmath95 ) . in this sense ,",
    "the absorbing phase may be considered as critical .",
    "note that since @xmath0 symmetry is already broken for @xmath96 , the system evolves toward the absorbing steady - state via coarsening of the af domains .",
    "the af domains are absorbing and thus monomers and dimers can not fall on them .",
    "they therefore must fall on the vacant regions which a s and b s are scattered within .",
    "coarsening process thus is driven by this interface - alone - fluctuations , and is expected to exhibit a dynamic scaling for the spatio - temporal correlations of the af order parameter .",
    "we may consider the observed persistent critical decay of the dimer density even within the absorbing phase as associated with this inevitable coarsening dynamics from initial vacuum state evolving toward the final ( symmetry - broken ) absorbing state at _ all _ points of the absorbing phase .",
    "in other words , if we assume that the total number of the dimers is proportional to the volume of the vacant regions , then the power law decay of the dimers will ensue from the power law decay of the volume of vacant regions associated with the kinetic self - similarity of the system during the coarsening ( i.e. , phase ordering ) process .",
    "as for the universal dp exponent value in the whole absorbing phase , we may draw some analogy to the `` zero temperature fixed point '' in the phase ordering of a standard ising model quenched to a temperature below the transition temperature @xmath97 , where the phenomenology of coarsening at _ any _ temperature below @xmath97 can be essentially represented by the _",
    "same _ universality of dynamic criticality .",
    "we now discuss on the continuum stochastic description for the gv universality class . in ref.[10 ] , the following langevin equation for the local sb order parameter field @xmath98 was proposed for a unified description of the two types of behaviors alluded earlier for the models in the gv class : _",
    "t =( a - b ^3 ) ( 1 -^2 ) + ^2 + where @xmath99 is a uncorrelated gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance , and @xmath100,@xmath101 , and @xmath102 are constants .",
    "this equation is a modified version of the langevin equation for the voter model @xcite ( ( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath103 ) so as to incorporate the splitting of the @xmath0 sb transition and the absorbing transition , which was first observed in the model studied in @xcite .",
    "since the order parameter field fluctuates around @xmath104 ( and hence @xmath105 ) near the sb transition , the multiplicative factor in the noise term in ( [ eq1 ] ) disappears , reducing ( [ eq1 ] ) to that of the model a. this argument seems to be consistent with the report of ref.[10 ] that the convincing numerical solution of ( [ eq1 ] ) reveals that the @xmath0 sb transition described by ( [ eq1 ] ) belongs to the ising universality class , which are evidenced by the fss scaling and measurements of the binder cumulant and time auto correlation function for the order parameter ( though these results are not shown explicitly in that paper ) .",
    "it is thus quite probable that the langevin equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can not fully describe the non - ising critical behavior of the sb transition observed in the present model .",
    "recently , vazquez and lpez ( vl ) @xcite derived a similar langevin equation from the microscopic model of the ising spins @xmath106 on a square lattice with spin flip dynamics controlled by a flip probability which is given by a function @xmath107 of the local magnetization @xmath108 ( @xmath109 being the coordination number ) with @xmath110 denoting sum over @xmath109 neighboring spins of @xmath106 .",
    "this was done by mapping the master equation into an approximate fokker - planck equation , and in turn into the corresponding langevin equation which is given by _",
    "t & = & ( a - b ^3 ) ( 1 -^2 ) + x",
    "( ) ^2 + , + x ( ) & & , + y ( ) & & ( 1 -^2 ) ( c+d ^2 ) + ( a - c+2d ) ^2 the corresponding spin - flip probability function is given by @xmath111 with @xmath112 and @xmath113 being constants .",
    "vl found through the simulation on a square lattice that the splitting of the sb and absorbing transitions is observed when the next - next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath114 ) spins are taken into account in the calculation of the local magnetization @xmath115 , and that the binder cumulant @xmath4 was obtained at the sb transition .",
    "we tend to believe that this value of @xmath23 , considerably smaller than the pure ising value @xmath116 , indicates that the sb transition exhibits a non - ising critical behavior .",
    "it is interesting to see that unlike ( [ eq1 ] ) , the corresponding langevin equation ( [ eq2 ] ) does not seem to reduce to the model a near the sb transition due to the forms of @xmath117 and @xmath118 in ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "this feature could leave a room for the possibility that the langevin equation ( [ eq2 ] ) might be able to generate a non - lsing critical behavior of the sb transition , which deserves a thorough investigation on the critical behavior of the sb transitions in both microscopic model and corresponding langevin equation proposed by vl .",
    "in the present work , we investigated a two dimensional imd model with short - range repulsion , which has two symmetric absorbing states .",
    "we find that the sb and absorbing transitions take place at two nearby points , as in some models @xcite with extended interaction range belonging to the gv universality class .",
    "interestingly , we observe numerically that the sb transition exhibits a new non - ising critical behavior with the exponents @xmath41 , @xmath119 , @xmath40 , and @xmath120 .",
    "we also find that the absorbing transition is of the dp - type , with a remarkable feature that the dimer density shows the same critical decay ( with the dp - exponent ) within the entire absorbing phase .",
    "the non - ising critical behavior of the sb transition is considered to be closely related to the fact that the effective extended range of repulsion between monomers mediated by dimers ( via neq dynamic rules ) creates wide vacant regions between the af domains , which can be considered as closely packed defects from the view of the af order .",
    "we suggested that the diverging fluctuations of these defects and dimers can lead to a non - ising critical behavior of the af order parameter at the sb transition .",
    "the persistent criticality in the absorbing phase can be attributed to the self - similar nature of the coarsening process ( i.e. , the af domain growth ) evolving toward symmetry - broken absorbing state . finally , we raise a possibility that a recently derived langevin equation based on the spin - flip dynamics of a collection of ising spins on a square lattice with a general flip probability might be able to describe similar non - ising critical behavior of the sb transition",
    ". it would thus be valuable to carry out further analysis on those models and continuum stochastic equations showing separate transitions in the gv universality class",
    ". it would be also interesting to conduct more detailed investigations into neq kinetics in both active and absorbing phases in the present model .",
