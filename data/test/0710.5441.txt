    "the study of complex networks has received an enormous amount of attention@xcite from the scientific community in recent years .",
    "physicists in particular have become interested in the study of networks describing the topologies of wide variety of systems , such as the world wide web@xcite , social and communication networks@xcite , biochemical networks and many more@xcite .",
    "one such problem is the analysis of community structure found in many networks .",
    "distinct communities or modules within networks can loosely be defined as subsets of nodes which are more densely linked , when compared to the rest of the network@xcite .",
    "such communities have been observed , using some of the methods , in many different contexts , including metabolic networks , banking networks and most notably social networks . as a result ,",
    "the problem of identification of communities has been the focus of many recent efforts .",
    "community detection in large networks is potentially very useful .",
    "nodes belonging to a tight - knit community are more than likely to have other properties in common . besides",
    ", these communities may probably be functional groups , which provide us valuable reference to our study in many other fields . in recent studies ,",
    "the scientists have designed many different algorithms@xcite(see @xcite as a review ) to detect the community structures .",
    "these algorithms can be divided into categories .",
    "some algorithms are designed according to maximal modularity @xmath3 .",
    "some are designed based on topology structures ( betweenness , degree , or clustering coefficient ) .",
    "the last is designed according to the dynamical properties of the network .",
    "communities within networks can be defined as subsets of nodes which are more densely linked , when compared to the rest of the network .",
    "modularity @xmath3 is an index advanced by newman and grivan@xcite as a measurement for the community structure .",
    "it gives a clear and precise definition of characteristics of the acknowledged community and have very successful application in practice .",
    "so it leads to many other algorithms brought forward to divide a community by maximizing modularity @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , maximizing modularity @xmath3 has been proven a npc problem@xcite , which makes it unable to work out the partition corresponding to maximal @xmath3 in a network which has lots nodes .",
    "actually many algorithms for maximizing @xmath3 are usually heuristic algorithm .",
    "besides , modularity @xmath3 has been proven strictly that , as an index to measure the community structure , it tends to combine the little communities rather than identify them successfully in the networks with definite communities@xcite . though modularity @xmath3 is proven to have the above - mentioned inherent defects , it is still the successful index to measure a network for the moment",
    ". therefore , lots of work for detecting communities are dependent on the index @xmath3 .    among the algorithms based on network topology , we want to introduce briefly the spectral analysis method and gn algorithm@xcite .",
    "gn algorithm was proposed by grivan and newman .",
    "it gives the division of network by remove links .",
    "the links with largest betweenness are removed one by one in order to split hierarchically the graph into community .",
    "but gn algorithm alone can only give the dendrogram concerning the network structure finally .",
    "it could not give the best partition directly . if we want to get the best partition we have to depend on modularity @xmath3 or other indexes to work it out . while the principle of the spectral analysis method@xcite is based on the theory of eigenvector of matrix .",
    "when a network is partitioned into two communities with the pre - fixed sizes , the best partition is to make the number of edges between the two communities being minimum .",
    "in fact , this problem is closely related to the eigenvector corresponding with the fiedler eigenvector ( the eigenvector correspond to second minimum eigenvalue ) of laplacian matrix of a network .",
    "relatively speaking , spectral analysis method is the most math theory - based approach .",
    "but it s still unable to get the best partition .",
    "besides , it requires to know the sizes of the two sub - network beforehand .",
    "although some methods are proposed to solve the two defects , like getting the best partition by using @xmath3 , ascertaining the sizes of the two sub - network by the sign of the elements of fielder eigenvector and so on , the inherent defects of spectral analysis method have not been solved perfectly and completely yet .",
    "there are still other algorithms based on the dynamics on networks , among which random walks@xcite method and circuit approach method@xcite will be briefly discussed here . in the random",
    "walks method , each node contains a walker initially .",
    "then each walker will randomly choose a neighbor of the node it currently stand on to localize .",
    "this is a markov process . after a period of time",
    ", the possibility will be higher that the walker reach another node belonging to the same community of the node the walker stood on at the beginning . and",
    "this possibility can be directly regarded as the possibility of pair of nodes in the same community and through it , a dendrogram can be got , then partition can be made by the aid of modularity @xmath3 .    when using random walk method to detect communities , it s difficult to specify the optimum random - walking time . and",
    "the best partition is dependent on the external index @xmath3 usually .",
    "the principle of circuit approach method is to regard the edges of the network as the resistances , and add voltage to the adequate nodes of the network , then work out the voltage of each node by kirchhoff s law .",
    "nodes with the similar voltages are regarded to exist in the same community more probably . at the same time , define the external indexes such as tolerance to realize the partition of the network .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new algorithm for identification communities based on signaling process on network . in this approach",
    ", every node is viewed as a system which can be inspired .",
    "it can send , receive , and record signals . in the initial , a node is selected as the source of signal .",
    "we give it an initial unit signal and other nodes with the signal of zero .",
    "then the source node send the signal to its neighbors and itself first .",
    "afterwards , the nodes with signals can also send signals to their neighbors and themselves .",
    "one thing should be mentioned in this signaling process is that the node can record the amount of signals it received , and at every time step , each node sends its present - owning signals to its neighbors and itself .",
    "after the inspiration of a certain @xmath4 time steps , the signal distribution over the nodes could be viewed as the influence of the source node to the whole network . for a network with @xmath0 nodes ,",
    "signal distribution can be characterized by a @xmath0d vector .",
    "if a network has @xmath0 nodes , we can get the influence of every node by the same operation .",
    "the results are given by @xmath0 @xmath0d vectors .",
    "generally speaking , the source node should influence its community first then through the community to influence the whole network .",
    "so naturally , compared with the nodes in other communities , nodes of the same community have similar influence toward the whole network . and the difference of influence could be given by the @xmath0d vectors .",
    "thus , by the above signaling process on networks , the topological structure of nodes is converted into the geometrical relationships of vectors in @xmath0d euclidian space .",
    "we can get the community structures of nodes by clustering these @xmath0d vectors . actually , there are already a lots of methods to cluster vectors in euclidian space . here",
    "we chose fuzzy c - means clustering method ( fcm ) assisted by @xmath1 statistic@xcite to get the best partition of the communities .",
    "@xmath1 statistic is developed in mathematical statistics .",
    "it describes the best partition as the one with the shorter average distance between the vectors inside the same community , and the larger distance between vectors of different communities . after getting the best number of groups by @xmath1 statistic",
    ", we can work out the communities by fcm . with the aid of @xmath1 statistic ,",
    "the method presented in this paper can detect community structures in complex network without any extra parameters .",
    "some problems related to above method are also discussed , including the optimum time steps @xmath4 of inspiration and the generalization of the method to weighted networks .",
    "then we applied the method to detect the communities in _ ad hoc _ and some real networks .",
    "its precision and accuracy are obtained and compared with some other algorithms .",
    "the results indicate that the method based on signaling process performs good .",
    "* a. signaling process . * for a network with @xmath0 nodes , every node is assumed to be a system which can send , receive , and record signals .",
    "one node can only affect its neighbors which will affect their neighbors too in the same way .",
    "finally , each node will affect the whole network .",
    "in general , one node will affect its community first and then the whole network via its community .",
    "so we can safely conclude that the nodes in the same community will affect the whole network in a similar way .    at the beginning",
    ", we select a node as source and let it has one unit of signal and the other nodes have no signal .",
    "then let the source node send signal to all of its neighbors and itself .",
    "after the first step the node and all its neighbors have a signal . in the second step , all the nodes which have signal will send it to their neighbors and themselves .",
    "every node will record the amount of signals it received and then it will send the same quantity of signals in the next time step .",
    "in this way , the process will be repeated constantly on the network .",
    "after @xmath4 time steps , we can get a @xmath0d vector that records each node s signal quantity which represents the effect of the source node .",
    "the signaling process is sketched out in fig.[spread in a simple net ] by simple network with 5 nodes . choosing every node as the source node respectively",
    ", we can get @xmath0 such vectors .",
    "the purpose that we let each node sends signal or signals to itself is to take account of the historical effects .",
    "this has been proved to be helpful to distinguish the amounts of signals between the nodes in the community and outside in a relatively short time period .",
    "standardizing the @xmath0 vectors , then the distance of each pair of vectors will represent the similarity of the corresponding nodes . using this kind of similarity the communities can be detected .     and",
    "other nodes have no signal initially .",
    "( b)in the first step node @xmath5 sends one signal to all its neighbors which are nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 and itself .",
    "then all nodes have @xmath5 signal .",
    "( c)next , each of them will send one signal to their neighbors and themselves respectively at the same time .",
    "after the second step , node @xmath5 has @xmath7 signals , both node @xmath8 and @xmath9 have @xmath10 signals and node @xmath10 and @xmath7 have @xmath9 signals .",
    "vector @xmath11 $ ] represents the effect of the node @xmath5 to the whole network in @xmath8 steps .",
    "( d)then every nodes send the same amount of signals as they received in the last step to their neighbors and themselves.,width=529 ]    actually , the above signaling process could be described by a simple but clear mathematical mechanism .",
    "suppose we have a network with @xmath0 nodes , it can be represented mathematically by an adjacency matrix @xmath12 with elements @xmath13 if there is an edge from @xmath14 to @xmath15 and @xmath16 otherwise .",
    "then the column @xmath14 of matrix @xmath17 will represent the effect of source node @xmath14 to the whole network in @xmath4 steps . in order to get the relative effect",
    ", we should standardize each column of matrix @xmath18 .",
    "assume the column @xmath14 of @xmath18 is @xmath19 , then the @xmath20 can be standardized as @xmath21 , here @xmath22 . then to partition the network which has @xmath0 nodes is equivalent to cluster @xmath0 vectors @xmath23 in euclidian space .",
    "* b. fuzzy @xmath2-mean clustering . *",
    "it is well known that there are many clustering methods and algorithms for the vectors in euclidian space . in this paper , we choose the inexpensive fuzzy @xmath2-mean clustering algorithm ( fcm)@xcite to detect communities for the vectors given by signaling process .",
    "fcm is described as following .    1 .",
    "set @xmath2 as the number of communities to partition .",
    "2 .   randomly choose @xmath2 vectors for the @xmath2 communities as their barycenters .",
    "3 .   randomly choose a vector .",
    "the vector will belong to the community when the distance between the vector and the barycenter of the community is minimum among all the barycenter of communities .",
    "4 .   re - compute the communities barycenters which have added a vector or deleted a vector .",
    "5 .   repeat step 3 to step 4 until all the barycenters can not be modified .",
    "we know that there are many definitions of distance . in our algorithm",
    "we choose the normal definition ",
    "euclidian distance to measure the similarity between vectors of nodes .",
    "* c. @xmath1 statistic .",
    "* at the first step of fuzzy @xmath2-mean clustering algorithm , we must set an extra parameter @xmath2 which presents how many clusters we will partition .",
    "here we use @xmath1 statistic@xcite to estimate the proper @xmath2 .",
    "now let we have a glance at @xmath1 statistic .",
    "suppose @xmath24 is the set of vectors of all nodes and @xmath25 , here @xmath26 is the @xmath27th character quantity of @xmath28 .",
    "suppose @xmath2 is the number of communities and @xmath29 is the number of nodes of @xmath14th community .",
    "we name all the nodes vectors of the @xmath14th community as @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the mean characters of @xmath14th community , @xmath32 be the @xmath14th community s barycenter and @xmath33be all the nodes barycenter , here @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath1 statistic is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the distance between @xmath37and @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the distance between @xmath40 node of @xmath14th and the barycenter @xmath37 .",
    "the numerator of @xmath1 signifies the distance of inter - communities and the denominator the distance of intra - communities .",
    "so the @xmath1 is bigger when the difference distance of inter - communities is bigger and the difference intra - communities is smaller .",
    "we can image that when @xmath1 achieve the maximum we can get the best partition .",
    "we use binary _ ad hoc _ networks which contains @xmath41 nodes and @xmath10 groups and proceed the signalling process as above to test the @xmath1 statistic .",
    "the results show that @xmath1 statistic is very efficacious . on the weighted _ ad hoc _ networks ,",
    "the results are similar with binary ones .",
    "when the community structure is clearer the maximal value of @xmath1 statistic is more distinct .",
    "the detailed results are shown in fig.[fpic ] .",
    "statistic as the function of number of clusters @xmath2 .",
    "plot shows the changes of @xmath1 statistic when @xmath42 and @xmath43 changes from @xmath10 to @xmath44 .",
    "it shows that when @xmath45 is smaller than @xmath44 , @xmath1 statistic can identify the right number of communities . when the community structure is clearer , the maximal value of @xmath1 statistic is very distinct.,width=340 ]      * a. the most optimal @xmath4 . *",
    "parameter @xmath4 is an important factor for the results of community identification .",
    "we can image that the length @xmath4 must be sufficiently long to gather enough information about the topology of the network and it should not be too long to faint the information we have gathered . in order to let majority of nodes can affect the whole network and do not to faint the information about the topology of the network , we guess that it may be optimal when @xmath4 is near to the average shortest path of network . in order to demonstrate our guess , some numerical experiments are done on binary networks which contains @xmath41 nodes and @xmath10 groups as above .",
    "the results are shown fig.[opt - t ] .",
    "the accuracy of the algorithm reach optimum when @xmath4 is 3 or 4 .",
    "of course , we only do some numerical experiments , it is hard to say the result satisfies all the networks .",
    "the random walks method@xcite has also the same problem . how to find the most optimal @xmath4 ?",
    "we think it is still an open problem .     always .",
    "the plot shows the changes of accuracy when @xmath4 changes form @xmath5 to @xmath46 on binary _ ad hoc _ networks . from the plots we can see @xmath47 is the proper length .",
    "and here @xmath9 is near the average shortest paths of each artificial networks.,width=340 ]    * b. time complexity analysis . * the time complexity of computing @xmath1 statistic is @xmath48 . for a definite @xmath2 which is the number of communities , the time complexity for fuzzy @xmath2-mean clustering is @xmath49 .",
    "time complexity of the process of signal diffusion is @xmath50 when we use the multiplication of matrix to simulate the process .",
    "but if we simulate the process in a network directly , the corresponding time complexity is @xmath51 , where , @xmath27 is the average degree of node in a network .    *",
    "c. generalization to weighted networks .",
    "* it is easy to generalize our algorithm to weighted network .",
    "suppose we have a weighted network with @xmath0 nodes , it can be represented mathematically by an adjacency matrix @xmath52 with elements @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath53 denotes the connection strength of node @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( in some weighted network",
    "@xmath53 dose not denote the strength of connection , we should transform the weight before the algorithm ) , then @xmath54 .",
    "the rest of the algorithm is same with the algorithm on binary _ ad hoc _ network .",
    "* d. relations with other methods .",
    "* there two main differences between our method and random walks method and circuit approach method .",
    "first , we use the signal diffusion process to transfer the topology to geometrical structure .",
    "the mathematical form is @xmath55 .",
    "the distance of each pair of column vectors of the matrix is the intimacy of the corresponding pair of nodes .",
    "the random walk method gets the intimacy of each pair of nodes by random walks .",
    "the mathematical form is @xmath56 where , @xmath57 denote the degree of node @xmath14 , @xmath58 means the diagonal matrix .",
    "take account of the effect of node degree , it also use the euclidian distance to define the intimacy .",
    "the circuit approach method gets the intimacy of each pair of nodes by kirchhoff s law . adding pressure on the proper two nodes , by kirchhoff s law",
    ", we can get the pressure of each node .",
    "more close of the pressure of two nodes are , more intimate the two nodes are .",
    "suppose add pressure on nodes @xmath5 and @xmath8 , then @xmath59 , where @xmath60 denotes the pressure of node @xmath14 .",
    "the mathematical form of kirchhoff s law is @xmath61 , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 denotes the matrix @xmath64 with deleting the first and the second columns and rows , @xmath65 .",
    "second , as to the method of clustering , we use the @xmath1 statistic and classical fcm method to partition the vectors .",
    "when the @xmath1 statistic achieve its maximum , we get the best partition .",
    "the random walks method and the circuit approach method are all need the help of other indexes to get the best partitions .",
    "one is modularity @xmath3 , the other is tolerance .",
    "so we could say that @xmath1 statistic and fcm method are all based on the geometrical structure of the vector space , but the other two methods need the help of extra parameters . because the random walks method and the circuit approach method both need some extra parameters which are very important to the results ,",
    "so in this paper we will not compare our results with that of these two algorithms in different networks .",
    "instead , we will compare the accuracy and precision with other famous algorithms which do not require any extra parameters .",
    "in order to investigate our algorithm , the accuracy and precision of our algorithm will be compared with potts algorithm(potts)@xcite , girvan - newman algorithm(gn)@xcite and extremal optimal algorithm(eo)@xcite .",
    "all these algorithms can be generalized to weighted networks@xcite .",
    "here we abbreviate gn weighted version as wgn and eo as weo .",
    "the accuracy and precision are defined in @xcite .",
    "accuracy means the consistence when the community structure from algorithm is compared with the presumed communities , and precision is the consistence among the community structures from different runs of an algorithm on the same network .",
    "the algorithm s accuracy and precision are calculated by @xmath66 function@xcite in this paper . in the following numerical investigations on _ ad hoc _ networks , we first get @xmath67 realizations of artificial community networks under the same conditions .",
    "then we run each algorithm to find communities in each network @xmath46 times . based on these results , using the similarity function @xmath66 , comparing each pair of these @xmath46 community structures and averaging over the @xmath67 networks ( average of totally @xmath68 results ) we could get the precision of the algorithm . comparing each divided groups with the presumed structures",
    ", we can get the accuracy of the algorithm by averaging these @xmath69 results",
    ".      * a. binary _ ad hoc _ networks . * in order to compare our algorithm with others we first test it on computer - generated random graphs with a well - known predetermined community structure@xcite .",
    "each graph has @xmath70 nodes divided into @xmath10 communities of @xmath71 nodes each .",
    "edges between two nodes are introduced with different probabilities depending on whether the two nodes belong to the same group or not : every node has @xmath72 links on average to its fellows in the same community , and @xmath43 links to the outer - world , keeping @xmath73 .",
    "fig.[compare on binary network ] shows the results .",

    "the clustering can be work out by fuzzy @xmath2-means clustering method(fcm ) with the help of @xmath1 statistic .",
    "moreover , our algorithm can also be generalized to weighted networks when we think the weighted connections can magnify or dwindle the signals linearly .",
    "thus the method presented here can detect the optimal community structures in binary and weighted networks without any extra parameters .    to solve the partition problem of complex networks , precision and accuracy of an algorithm are two standards for us to choose the method .",
    "so we make a comparison between our algorithm and other relatively mature ones such as eo , potts and gn algorithms both in binary and weighted networks .",
    "results for both _",
    "ad hoc _ and real networks have proved that our algorithm is effective .",
    "one problem of our algorithm is that we havent given a clear range of the most optimal steps @xmath4 of inspiring .",
    "actually , some other algorithms such as the random walks method@xcite exist also the similar problem .",
    "so we think it is an open problem and we will do some deep research on it in the future .",
