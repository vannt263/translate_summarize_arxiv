    "as one combines relativistic quantum mechanics  @xcite with general relativity  @xcite , one has to formulate the dirac equation on a curved space - time  @xcite .",
    "one of the most paradigmatic calculations concerns the dirac ",
    "schwarzschild hamiltonian  @xcite , which is obtained for a dirac particle in the static schwarzschild metric . the dirac  schwarzschild problem constitutes the analogue of the dirac  coulomb problem  @xcite , which is otherwise relevant for the dirac particle bound to a central coulomb potential , as opposed to a central gravitational field .",
    "the main problem is that , unlike for the dirac ",
    "coulomb problem , the gravitational central - field dirac  schwarzschild problem can not be treated based on the correspondence principle alone .",
    "namely , the gravitational potential @xmath10 can not simply be inserted into the dirac ",
    "schwarzschild hamiltonian .",
    "one first has to couple  @xcite the dirac particle to the curved space - time , using a fully covariant formalism , and then , identify the translation operator for the time coordinate with the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "this identification becomes unique in the dirac  schwarzschild problem when we demand that the time coordinate have a smooth limit to the flat - space time in the regime of large separation  @xcite .",
    "we recall that for the dirac ",
    "coulomb problem , one simply adds the coulomb potential @xmath11 to the free dirac hamiltonian , in the sense of a minimal coupling of the bound electron to the central electrostatic field of the nucleus  @xcite . here , @xmath12 is the nuclear charge number , @xmath13 is the elementary charge , @xmath14 is the vacuum permittivity , and @xmath7 is the distance from the center of the potential . both the dirac  schwarzschild as well as the dirac ",
    "coulomb hamiltonians take into account the gauge boson exchange ( graviton exchange and coulomb photon exchange , respectively ) to all orders , but only in the classical approximation .",
    "this is sufficient to calculate the corrections of order @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath15 and @xmath17 denote the gravitational and electrodynamic fine - structure constants , respectively .",
    "we anticipate that the familiar @xmath5 degeneracy of the energy levels of the dirac",
    " coulomb problem will be lifted for gravitational coupling , which implies that for example , the gravitationally coupled @xmath18 and @xmath19 levels are not degenerate . for the electromagnetically coupled hydrogen atom , the corresponding degeneracy is lifted only by the lamb shift ; the theoretical explanation involves a manifestly quantized electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the lifted degeneracy , in the case of gravitational coupled , is different : namely , we observe that it is due to the space - time curvature corrections to the kinetic term in the dirac ",
    "schwarzschild hamiltonian .",
    "this finding is illustrated by a comparison to the energy levels of an attractive scalar potential , which are also calculated here , including relativistic corrections .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we consider the fine structure of the energy levels of the dirac  schwarzschild hamiltonian and express the result in terms of the gravitational fine - structure constant @xmath20 , and of the quantum numbers of the bound state . in passing , we clarify that the quantum mechanical gravitational central - field problem has bound states . for clarity , but without loss of generality , we consider a gravitationally coupled `` atom '' consisting of electron and proton . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we compare to the energy levels of an attractive scalar potential .",
    "having clarified the physical origin of the correction terms which lift the @xmath5 degeneracy , we continue in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] with the identification of a set of physical parameters for a gravitationally coupled system , where the calculations reported here might be phenomenologically relevant .",
