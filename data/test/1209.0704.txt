    "the matrix element for ionization is written as a coherent sum over ionization times for which the corresponding quantum orbits all lead to a given , final momentum @xmath0 at the detector ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if there are more than one such orbits of similar weight , interference comes into play .",
    "interfering orbits originating from subsequent laser cycles give rise to peaks in energy spectra that are separated by @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the laser frequency , the so - called `` above - threshold ionization '' ( ati ) peaks .",
    "we call this `` inter - cycle interference '' , in contrast to `` intra - cycle interference '' @xcite where the interfering orbits originate from within one laser cycle , leading to , e.g. , the holographic interference patterns observed in @xcite .",
    "intra- and inter - cycle interference in time is in analogy to a double slit and a grating in position space , respectively .",
