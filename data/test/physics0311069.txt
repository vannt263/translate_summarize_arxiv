    "for atomization energies and geometries , density functional theory ( dft ) constitutes a cost - effective alternative to wavefunction - based _ ab initio _ methods , being capable of accuracies on the order of a few kcal / mol and a few picometer , respectively , if basis sets of polarized triple zeta quality are employed@xcite .    as a result of this astonishing success , especially considering the modest computational cost of dft methods , a variety of new applications are now being explored@xcite , including , very recently , the calculation of molecular anharmonic potential energy surfaces @xcite .",
    "anharmonic potential energy surfaces ( see refs.@xcite for initial pioneering studies at the scf and cisd level ) allow for the prediction of molecular vibration - rotation spectra that can be compared directly to experiment , obviating the need to make estimations or approximations for the effect of anharmonicity .",
    "ccsd(t)/@xmath0 anharmonic force fields can achieve accuracies on the order of 10 @xmath1 or better for fundamentals ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , and even greater accuracy is achievable if still larger basis sets and corrections for inner - shell correlation are considered@xcite .",
    "+ dft anharmonic force fields for small molecules have recently been the subject of two validation studies@xcite .",
    "our own validation study@xcite suggested that , for fundamental frequencies , an rms accuracy of about 18 @xmath1 can be attained when using the b97 - 1 functional with sufficiently large basis sets .",
    "the question arises as to how capable dft is to treat medium - sized organic molecules in this fashion . particularly relevant here is the study the study of miani et al.@xcite on the fundamental frequencies of benzene , which employed the b3lyp@xcite functional with the tz2p ( triple - zeta plus double polarization ) basis set .",
    "this paper , as well as a more recent study of furan , pyrrole and thiophene@xcite , in fact yielded even more accurate results on these medium - sized organic systems than suggested by the small - molecule validation studies cited above .",
    "+ the azabenzenes are obtained by systematically replacing ch moieties in benzene by nitrogen atoms .",
    "numerous experimental spectra of these compounds are available in the literature , ranging from mono - azabenzene ( pyridine ) to 1,2,4,5-tetraazabenzene ( s - tetrazine ) .",
    "pentazine is quite elusive@xcite ; the equally elusive n@xmath2 ( hexazine or hexaazabenzene ) molecule has been the subject of extensive theoretical studies@xcite : at the ccsd(t)/cc - pvtz level , the hexazine ( hexaazabenzene ) structure undergoes distortion from the idealized @xmath3 ring to a @xmath4 geometry , which is a local minimum situated some 23 kcal / mol above the @xmath5 diazide global minimum@xcite .",
    "straka recently made the interesting suggestion that cyclic n@xmath2 may form very stable m(@xmath6-n@xmath2 ) complexes with m = ti , zr , hf , th@xcite .    in practice ,",
    "nine molecules are relevant to the present study : the parent benzene molecule , pyridine , pyridazine , pyrimidine , pyrazine , 1,2,3-triazine , 1,2,4-triazine , 1,2,5-triazine ( _ sym_-triazine ) and 1,2,4,5-tetrazine ( s - tetrazine ) .",
    "all molecules are displayed in figure 1 .",
    "+ azabenzene skeletons serve as building blocks in nature , e.g. , pyridine in pyridixol ( vitamin b@xmath2 ) , pyridazine and pyrimidine in pteridine , itself found in folic acid ( vitamin vitamin b@xmath7 ) and riboflavin ( vitamin b@xmath8 ) .",
    "moreover the four dna bases are derivates of pyrimidine ( c , t ) and of purine ( a , g )  itself a pyrimidine - imidazole fused ring system . for these reasons ,",
    "azabenzene - like compounds figure in drug design , e.g. the reverse transcriptase inhibitors azt ( contains pyrimidine ) or nevirapine ( contains pyridine ) .",
    "derivatives of pyridazine have been found to have potential therapeutic or plant growth inhibitory effects .",
    "+ quite different applications include melamine - based plastics ( melamine is a derivative of s - triazine ) and the potential use of s - tetrazine in molecular data storage applications ( one of the relaxation mechanisms of the @xmath9 state leads to 2 hcn+n@xmath8.@xcite ) .",
    "+ innes , ross and moomaw ( irm throughout this paper ) published a compilation and critical review of experimental vibration spectroscopic data current to 1988@xcite .",
    "one of us ( with c. van alsenoy ) carried out a harmonic - only b3lyp / cc - pvtz study of the vibrational frequencies and geometries.@xcite the limitations of this approach are obvious .",
    "+ in the present contribution , we will consider dft _",
    "anharmonic _ force fields and anharmonic vibrational spectra  which are directly comparable to experiment  for the azabenzenes , and demonstrate their power as a spectroscopic assignment tool for medium - sized organic molecules .",
    "in our validation study@xcite , we considered a wide variety of exchange - correlation functionals , as well as convergence in terms of the basis set and the integration grids ( both kohn - sham , ks , and coupled perturbed kohn - sham ) .    especially for organic molecules , we found the best performance to be delivered by the b97 - 1 functional , which is handy s reparametrization@xcite of becke s 1997 hybrid functional@xcite .",
    "satisfactory basis set convergence was generally found to be achieved with the tz2p basis set@xcite .",
    "this is therefore the functional / basis set combination employed for the present study .",
    "we found@xcite results for anharmonic force field calculations to be exceedingly dependent on the ks integration grid , much less so on the cpks grid .",
    "for the present study , we ended up using a ( 200,974 ) grid , that is , the direct product of a 200-point euler - maclaurin radial grid with a 974-point lebedev angular grid . for the cpks steps",
    ", we employed a ( 75,194 ) grid , which considerably reduced the overall computational cost .",
    "neither grid was pruned .",
    "the quartic force fields were calculated by numerical central differences ( in rectilinear normal coordinates ) of analytical second derivatives , using a stand - alone driver program adapted from the cadpac electronic structure program system@xcite .",
    "the actual dft second derivative calculations were done using the gaussian 98 rev . a11 program package@xcite .",
    "the step size in a numerical derivatives calculation always represents a compromise between discretization error and roundoff error .",
    "based on experience , we determined the step size as a functions of both the absolute value of the harmonic frequency associated with the normal coordinate involved , and the associated reduced mass ( @xmath10 ) : @xmath11 in order to reduce roundoff error as much as possible , the ks and cpks equations were basically converged to machine precision .    to calculate this factor , both the reduced mass of the mode @xmath12 and the eigenvalues of the normalisation",
    "matrix @xmath13 are needed .",
    "the last part of equation 1 , depending on the harmonic frequencies @xmath14 , additionally ensures that each displaced geometry has approximately the same energy difference to the minimum geometry .",
    "+ in this manner , we obtain a complete cubic force field , as well as all the diagonal and semidiagonal quartic force constants .",
    "these are sufficient for second - order rovibrational perturbation theory analyses@xcite , which were carried out using the spectro@xcite and polyad@xcite programs developed in the cambridge group and at weizmann , respectively .",
    "the parent molecule of our series , benzene ( figure 1a ) , has been the subject of a few previous anharmonic force field studies , two at the scf / dzp level@xcite , and a very recent one at the b3lyp / tz2p level@xcite .",
    "an extensive experimental literature exists on the subject ( see refs.@xcite for reviews ) : high resolution data are available for many of the fundamentals , and all the assignments can be regarded as conclusive . ( an analysis of the b3lyp / cc - pvtz normal modes of benzene and the azabenzenes in terms of pulay s redundant internal coordinates can be found in table 17 of ref.@xcite . )    experimentally obtaining harmonic frequencies for a molecule this large , even with such high symmetry , is a nearly impossible task . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we compare computed harmonic frequencies with selected prior calculations ( in particular ccsd(t)/@xmath0 data@xcite ) , as well as several sets of experimentally derived data .",
    "the first such set are the ` @xmath15 ' estimates of handy , murray and amos ( hma)@xcite , themselves obtained as averages of an empirical estimate by goodman , ozkabak , and thakur ( got)@xcite and their own combination of experimental fundamentals with the scf / dzp computed anharmonicities of maslen et al.@xcite .",
    "the second set are derived from the experimental fundamentals and a new scf / dzp anharmonic analysis by handy and willetts ( hw)@xcite . the third set is derived from the experimental fundamentals and the b3lyp / tz2p anharmonicities@xcite , and is expected to be the most reliable . + both sets of dft numbers compare about equally well with the ccsd(t ) data .",
    "the c - h stretching frequencies are underestimated by about 20 @xmath1 , while all other frequencies are being reproduced very accurately .",
    "( as an aside , we note that the c  h underestimation problem also occurs@xcite at the mller - plesset perturbation theory ( mp2 ) level . )",
    "although the c  h stretches are reproduced marginally worse by the b97 - 1 functional ( 3 @xmath1 ) compared to the reference ccsd(t)/@xmath0 values , the overall performance is improved : the mean absolute error decreases from 9.3 ( b3lyp ) to 6.5 ( b97 - 1 ) @xmath1 , and the rms deviation from 10.6 ( b3lyp ) to 9.6 ( b97 - 1 ) .",
    "the smaller decrease for the rms error ( compared to the mean absolute error ) can be attributed to the greater proportional weight given to larger errors .",
    "when excluding the c - h stretching frequencies , the rms errors decrease to 8.4 ( b3lyp ) and 4.3 @xmath1 ( b97 - 1 ) . considering the computational cost of density functional theory ,",
    "the b3lyp results are already of spectacular compared to the reference _ ab initio _ data .",
    "the b97 - 1 functional , however , reduces the rms error of the non c - h stretching frequencies by an additional 50% .",
    "+ both functionals yield excellent agreement with experiment for the fundamental frequencies ( table [ tab2 ] ) . the experimental data were taken from the earlier compilation of got@xcite and from more recent gas - phase measurements@xcite .",
    "the two sets of experimental data agree very well with each other , except for @xmath16 and @xmath17 which are involved in strong fermi resonances . to obtain the b97 - 1/tz2p fundamentals , we had to take the following fermi resonances into consideration : @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( with the deperturbed frequency @xmath19 at 3018 @xmath1 and the combination at 2947 @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 and @xmath17 ( unperturbed @xmath22 at 3040 and the combination band at 3082 @xmath20 ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( with the unperturbed frequencies at 3064 and 3020 @xmath20 ) , and @xmath25 and @xmath16 ( with @xmath16 ( unperturbed ) at 1600 , @xmath25 at 1603 @xmath20 ) .",
    "+ interestingly , because of the small differences in the harmonic frequencies between the b3lyp / tz2p and the b97 - 1/tz2p calculations and the different force field , now new fermi resonances are predicted .",
    "furthermore , the fundamentals affected by these resonances are the ones which differ the most when using the b3lyp or b97 - 1 functional .",
    "because of the fermi resonances , the difference between different functionals and methods becomes more important than on the harmonic level of approximation .",
    "the results of both functionals compared to experiment are , however , very similar , with mean absolute errors ( compared to the latest experimental results of miani et al.@xcite ) of 9.4 ( b3lyp ) and 8.3 ( b97 - 1 ) @xmath1 and rms errors of 17.0 and 13.7 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "again , all frequencies are very well described with the exception of the c - h stretches , which are underestimated by 1630 @xmath1 ( discounting @xmath24 which is severely perturbed by resonances ) . without the c",
    "- h stretches , the mean absolute errors are reduced to 3.7 ( b3lyp ) and 3.9 ( b97 - 1 ) @xmath1 and the rms errors to 4.8 ( b3lyp ) and 4.5 @xmath1 ( b97 - 1 ) .",
    "hence , while clearly better for harmonic frequencies , the b97 - 1 functional is only slightly better for predicting the fundamental frequencies of benzene .",
    "nevertheless , the accuracy obtained by density functional theory , which yields rms errors of less than 5 @xmath1 for non c - h stretching frequencies , is very good .",
    "+ in the third column , we added the b97 - 1/tz2p anharmonic corrections to the ccsd(t)/ano4321 harmonic frequencies of ref.@xcite , in order to see how such a ` hybrid ' ab initio - dft approach would perform .",
    "the principal improvement seen is for the c  h stretches , which are thus all bought into the range of the experimental values , except for @xmath26 , which is in resonance with @xmath23 as discussed above .",
    "when discounting c  h stretching frequencies , the improvement compared to a pure b97 - 1/tz2p calculation is quite modest , to 3.1 @xmath1 for the mean absolute error and to 4.1 @xmath1 for the rms error .",
    "the corresponding error statistics including c ",
    "h stretching frequencies change rather more significantly , to a mean absolute error of 4.0 @xmath1 and an rms error of 7.4 @xmath1 .",
    "+ summarizing , b97 - 1/tz2p is likely to be a useful tool for analysis of vibrational spectra ( and verification of their assignments ) of aromatic organic molecules in general and of the azabenzene series in particular .",
    "pyridine being the simplest azabenzene ( figure 1b ) and the closest to the parent molecule , we may anticipate similar accuracy as for benzene .",
    "as expected for this chemically important species , many experimental spectra are available , in both liquid and gas phases .",
    "most of the experimental results and the latest experimental assignments are summarized by klots@xcite .",
    "the computed and observed vibrational frequencies are presented in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "as expected , the c - h stretching frequencies are not well described . here , they are also heavily perturbed , and , considering performance for the corresponding bands in benzene , our method may not be sufficiently accurate to assist in the experimental assignment . thus , although we will attempt to elaborate on the c - h stretching frequencies for most azabenzenes , the results are more tentative .",
    "additionally , a small change in the original unperturbed fundamental frequencies will cause large changes in the perturbed frequencies .",
    "nevertheless , the two asymmetric stretches @xmath27 and @xmath19 do not follow the general trend of being underestimated by 2040 @xmath1 . while the perturbed @xmath27 is close to the experimental value , @xmath19 differs by 70 @xmath1 .",
    "especially the latter appears too large to be accounted for merely by deficiencies in our dft calculation . here , the severe fermi resonance seems to be responsible for this assignment , as its deperturbed value is at 3021 @xmath1 .",
    "this mode is resonating with ( deperturbed frequencies given ) @xmath27 at 3053 @xmath1 , @xmath28 at 3015 @xmath1 and @xmath29 at 3054 @xmath1 , with the perturbed @xmath28 now appearing at 3023 @xmath1 .",
    "it appears that the latter value is more in line with experiment , and that perhaps this assignment might be more reasonable . nevertheless , some caution is appropriate as the c  h harmonic stretching frequencies are not as well described by dft as the remaining modes .",
    "large basis set ccsd(t ) harmonic frequencies would be helpful here , but would require inordinate amounts of cpu time .",
    "+ another picture emerges for the non c - h frequency modes . here",
    ", we primarily compare to the medium resolution raman vapor data of klots ( klots2)@xcite : their assignments seem to be in line with most other experiments , although they differ from the most recent data obtained by partal et al.@xcite . comparing to these latter inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) data ,",
    "however , amounts to comparing apples and oranges , as the ins data are based on further refinement of a dft computed _ harmonic _ force field by maximizing agreement between simulated and observed ins spectral .",
    "the pseudo - harmonic frequencies from the refined force field correspond neither to true harmonic nor to true fundamental frequencies  in effect , they are neither fish nor fowl .",
    "+ we can confirm the assignment of klots@xcite of @xmath30 to the lower value of 1053 @xmath1 .",
    "difficult assignments seem to result from the fermi resonances for both @xmath31 and @xmath32 , since these are the only fundamentals which give errors of 10 @xmath1 or larger .",
    "the deperturbed mode of @xmath31 at 1578 @xmath1 resonates with @xmath33 at 1593 @xmath1 resulting in perturbed modes at 1575 and 1596 @xmath1 .",
    "klots may have misassigned the latter band to @xmath31 rather than @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath32 , on the other hand , seems to be very difficult to assign from experimental data because of its depolarized character .",
    "the problem is further exacerbated as @xmath32 is located at the shoulder of @xmath34 .",
    "although @xmath32 is involved in a fermi resonance , it is probably not the source of the disagreement with , since its unperturbed frequency at 1241 @xmath1 resonates with @xmath35 at 1282 @xmath1 , resulting in bands at 1237 and 1289 @xmath1 . with the exception of these two strongly perturbed bands ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) ,",
    "the agreement between experiment and theory can only be described as stunning for bands other than c - h stretches . for the latter , probably only a full ccsd(t ) force field",
    "can resolve the assignment .",
    "even when including @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( but excluding all c - h stretching frequencies ) , the mean absolute error for the computed values compared to the experimental data of klots@xcite is 3.6 @xmath1 and the rms error is 5.3 @xmath1 ; without @xmath31 and @xmath32 they are reduced to 2.7 and 3.8 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "+ the double - harmonic infrared intensities are in good agreement with the b3lyp / cc - pvtz values@xcite and in reasonable agreement with the experimental numbers . even here ,",
    "the c - h stretches differ , probably not only because of anharmonic contributions and fermi resonances , but also because of the poor description of these modes by dft .",
    "still , the excellent performance seen for benzene results is repeated for pyridine .",
    "pyridazine ( figure 1c ) has been of particular interest in the last couple of years @xcite .",
    "a large body of experimental data is available , generally measured in the gas phase but when certain modes were unavailable , the authors of ref.@xcite substituted their own liquid or solid phase measurements in order to get a full complement of frequencies .",
    "all of the spectra have been assigned with the aid of scaled hartree - fock , mp2 , blyp or b3lyp harmonic force fields using small basis sets .",
    "some of them have their force fields fitted to match the experimental data . despite the large amount of data ,",
    "huge discrepancies exist , as shown in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "this seems to be especially true for the out - of - plane modes where experimental assignments and values seem almost arbitrary . for @xmath36 ,",
    "for example , the experimental numbers range from 765 to 949 @xmath1 , and even the two most recent numbers appear at opposite ends of this range .",
    "these assignments have been done using different methods and scaling techniques , since no reliable theoretical data were available at the time .",
    "+ the same problem with the c - h stretches that was encountered for benzene and pyridine occurs for pyridazine as well ; the situation is further complicated since the experimental data differs and thus we can not assign the frequencies of the experiment . despite the discrepancies between various experimental numbers , all the c - h stretches appear plausible within the error range of our method . + as the ins data set dramatically varies from the remainder of the experimental data , and",
    "because it did not appear to be reliable for pyridine , it was excluded from our analysis , although it is reported in table [ tab4 ] for completeness .",
    "+ since such a large amount of experimental data is available , it is best to discuss each mode separately , starting with the in - plane modes .    * for @xmath37 ,",
    "all experiments except the first of ref.@xcite agree on an assignment to the 1570 @xmath1 band .",
    "our results , however , would seem to indicate that the assignment around 1555 @xmath1 might be more plausible .",
    "* the same occurs for @xmath31 .",
    "experimental values of refs.@xcite cluster around 1440 @xmath1 , with refs .",
    "@xcite around 1415 @xmath1 .",
    "our calculation clearly favors the former assignment . * for @xmath24",
    ", significant differences between experiments of refs.@xcite and the computed value of 1145 @xmath1 can be found .",
    "the experimental results are thus untenable in light of this huge discrepancy of more than a hundred @xmath1 , and only ref.@xcite proposes an assignment of 1160 @xmath1 , which still appears to be on the high side . * for @xmath34 ,",
    "most experiments have assignments around the computed 1157 @xmath1 ; however , ref.@xcite assigned this mode to 1120 @xmath1 because of their previous assignment .",
    "our calculated @xmath24 and @xmath34 nearly coincide , * for @xmath38 , all experimental datasets are in agreement with each other and our calculations . considering the generally small anharmonicities for this type of vibrations , the discrepancy of 40 @xmath1 between the computed @xmath39 and the observed @xmath40 seems to be a bit on the large side .",
    "the experimental assignment may have been complicated by the band s position in an ir band envelope going from 960 to 980 @xmath1@xcite . * as with @xmath24 , the experimental assignment for @xmath41 of vazquez et al.@xcite differs from the other obtained fundamentals , and is the only one that can be confirmed by our calculations . * for @xmath16 , only refs.@xcite differ from the computed values , while for @xmath42 , the experimental assignment of stidham and tucci@xcite both in the ir and the raman phase appear doubtful . @xmath43 agrees nicely with all experiments . * for @xmath32 and @xmath22 ,",
    "the same assignment problems that we experienced for @xmath24 and @xmath34 seem to have occurred ; while most experiments assign values above 1100 @xmath1 to @xmath32 , only vazquez et al.@xcite seem to give the correct assignment .",
    "this results , however , in the value of @xmath22 thus ending up a bit on the low side , and only the value of ref.@xcite ends up close to our calculated number . the same seems to have happened to @xmath30 , where only ref.@xcite is in line with our calculations .",
    "hence , for the in - plane modes , the data set of vazquez et al.@xcite appears to be most reliable , excluding @xmath37 and @xmath34 ( which appear to be dubious assignments ) and perhaps @xmath40 and @xmath22 .",
    "* for the out - of - plane modes , the experimental assignment appears to be even more problematic . for @xmath44 ,",
    "all experiments differ by 20 @xmath1 , and are either found at 998 or 842 @xmath1 .",
    "both assignments appear to be unlikely , since the harmonic b97 - 1 frequency is at 981 @xmath1 , which would put the fundamental too low for 998 and definitely way too high for assignment to the 842 @xmath1 band .",
    "* for @xmath45 , all experimental assignments are around the computed 751 @xmath1 , while for @xmath46 , all the experiments appear to yield assignments higher than our computed fundamental of 362 @xmath1 . * based on our data , all the @xmath47 symmetry modes ( @xmath48 through @xmath49 ) should probably be re - examined , since several experimental results differ drastically from each other and from our calculations .",
    "a discussion of these modes is almost impossible , and with the exception of refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath49 , all experimental assignments lie beyond the likely error bars of the theoretical values .    on the whole , the pyridazine vibrational spectra definitely merit further investigation , as the many experimental and theoretical datasets available are considerably at variance with each other .",
    "thus , it is impossible to give an error estimate for the method used based on this molecule .",
    "however if our computational results prove to be as accurate as for benzene and pyridine , the experimental spectra have to be reexamined . based on this study",
    ", one might wonder whether the addition of more nitrogens or the n - n bond is causing the deterioration of the calculated values .",
    "pyrimidine ( figure 1d ) , has been studied less in recent years .",
    "notable are the ir experiments compiled by irm@xcite , the ir experiments of billes et al.@xcite , and the inelastic neutron scattering work of navarro et al.@xcite . here , we compare mainly to the ir experiments , since the ins data for neither pyridine nor pyridazine agree well with our computed values and the other experiments , for reasons outlined above",
    ". nevertheless , for pyrimidine the ins data seem a lot closer to the ir data than for the previous two azabenzenes ( table [ tab5 ] ) .",
    "the values for the @xmath50 c - h stretches are in agreement with experiment , although this seems fortuitous .",
    "otherwise , all in - plane modes are within 8 @xmath1 of experiment , with the sole exception of @xmath42 .",
    "interestingly , both @xmath38 and @xmath41 undergo strong fermi type 1 and 2 resonances ; their resonance matrices are displayed in table[tab6 ] with their respective eigensolutions . for @xmath38 , very small changes in the unperturbed fundamentals would result in the value ending up not at 1071 @xmath1 , but at the experimental assignment of 1065 @xmath1 .",
    "the assignment of the two resonating modes appears to be purely arbitrary . as for @xmath41 ,",
    "the resonating overtone of @xmath46 matches the experimental number exactly .",
    "since both modes are in resonance , the overtone might have `` borrowed intensity '' ( as described in ref.@xcite ) from @xmath41 , and thus the assignment .",
    "+ when looking at the out - of - plane modes in table [ tab5 ] , only @xmath48 and @xmath22 yield different results compared to the first set of experimental results .",
    "both discrepancies have been mentioned before by the harmonic - only study@xcite , and @xmath22 has a very small intensity .",
    "moreover , by using scaled hf frequencies , wiberg@xcite has suggested that the assignment for @xmath48 might also be incorrect .",
    "the irm@xcite assignments for modes 5 , 6 , 13 and 21 appear more plausible than from ref.@xcite . neglecting the problematic modes 10 and 20 and reassigning mode 9 to 677 @xmath1 , the errors , including the c - h stretches , are 6.3 ( mean absolute ) and 11.4 @xmath1 ( rms ) , and without them are 4.1 and 5.3 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "thus this method again appears to be very reliable for predicting fundamental frequencies .      as with pyrimidine",
    ", only few experiments have been done for pyrazine ( figure 1e ) .",
    "the vibrational assignments are displayed in table [ tab7 ] .",
    "in ref.@xcite , assignments were done in the gas phase for the ir active modes and in a melt for the raman spectrum .",
    "overall , the agreement is again very good for modes other than c - h stretches .",
    "if the previously mentioned tendency to underestimate the c - h stretches is taken into account , all assignments appear plausible , with the possible exception of the assignment of @xmath36 from ref.@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that all of the c - h stretches are perturbed by fermi resonances . for the in - plane modes",
    ", especially @xmath30 appears to lie beyond the error bars of our method .",
    "it has been mentioned by the harmonic - only study in ref.@xcite that this ` kekul mode ' is problematic and it was concluded that this mode has significant multireference character , since it corresponds to the dissociation into 2 hcn + c@xmath8h@xmath8 .",
    "however , hybrid density functionals are usually capable to describe nondynamical correlation to a certain extent , since for example the atomization energy of ozone is reasonably well reproduced . for this mode ,",
    "the assignment of ref.@xcite appears to be out of question .",
    "+ for all the other modes , most the experiments scatter only by about 5 @xmath1 , with this agreement suggesting that their assignments and values are pretty accurate .",
    "the out - of - plane modes are generally quite well described by theory .",
    "note that the two @xmath51 modes since they are neither ir nor raman active ; for this reason they are not assigned in ref.@xcite .",
    "the ins values are somewhat disappointing for both frequencies , since the chief advantage of this method is the ability to predict such bands .",
    "another discrepancy is the first @xmath52 mode ( @xmath41 ) , although the second experiment of ref.@xcite is closer to our values . +",
    "this leads to mean absolute and rms errors compared to ref.@xcite ( ref.@xcite ) of 7.8 ( 7.9 ) and 10.4 ( 11.1 ) @xmath1 including the c - h stretches , and of 5.4 ( 5.1 ) and 6.9 ( 6.5 ) @xmath1 when excluding them .",
    "if the problematic @xmath53 and @xmath41 are excluded , the mean absolute and rms errors for the non c - h stretches reduces to 4.1 ( 4.1 ) and 5.4 ( 5.5 ) @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "thus , the general rms discrepancy of 5 to 7 @xmath1 is obtained for pyrazine as well .",
    "+      1,3,5-triazine ( figure 1f ) is the only azabenzene with a degenerate point group symmetry ( @xmath54 ) . because of this ,",
    "the @xmath55 modes ( @xmath31 and @xmath24 ) are both ir and raman inactive . the ins @xcite value for @xmath56 coincides exactly with our calculation ( table [ tab8 ] ) ; the discrepancy of 124 @xmath1 for @xmath24 is outlandish even for the ins data and this band is probably misassigned .",
    "the inelastic neutron scattering data@xcite are clearly inferior to the other experimental datasets .",
    "this is hardly surprising as this method relies on fitting and scaling a harmonic force field which is obtained from dft in small split - valence basis sets .",
    "already for the harmonics , this introduces errors on the order of about 50 @xmath1 . the error for the c - h stretches",
    "is expected to be even larger .",
    "it would be interesting to reanalyze their data based on the present anharmonic force fields , although this still would not resolve the problems associated with the c - h stretches , for which large basis set coupled cluster frequencies would be desirable .",
    "the experimental ir / raman data of daunt et al.@xcite and lancaster et al.@xcite are very similar to those of irm@xcite and are not listed in table [ tab8 ] . with the exception of the first @xmath57 @xmath17 and the c - h stretches , which are again underestimated , all computed values are within 11 @xmath1 of experiment again , the errors are similar to the other azabenzenes ; including the c - h stretches , the mean absolute error is 7.6 @xmath1 and the rms error 11 @xmath1 . excluding the stretches ( and @xmath17 ) ,",
    "these numbers reduce to 5.1 ( 3.4 ) and 7.5 ( 5.0 ) @xmath1 , respectively .      for 1,2,3-triazine ( figure 1 g )",
    ", only one ir and raman spectrum in kbr has been experimentally determined@xcite : the assignment was assisted by scaled mp2/6 - 31 g * harmonic frequencies .",
    "the spectrum looks very similar to that of pyrimidine ; even the same fermi resonances are present .",
    "+ at first glance at the spectra in table [ tab9 ] , the agreement between theory and experiment is disappointing .",
    "for very few of the modes is there agreement between the spectra .",
    "however , the authors did not consider _ any _ fermi resonances in the lower spectrum ( although they noted that one might exist , involving @xmath42 ) , and simply assumed the ordering of the fundamentals to be identical to that of the mp2/6 - 31 g * harmonics .",
    "this however leads to obvious misassignments .",
    "for example , @xmath34 and @xmath43 lie almost on top of each other , while @xmath58 borrows intensity from @xmath34 because of the fermi resonance , as can be seen in table [ tab10 ] . if the resonance were not as strong as computed ",
    "specifically , if the unperturbed fundamental were shifted only a few @xmath1 towards higher values , the perturbed @xmath58 , presently calculated at 1056 @xmath1 , might easily correspond to the band at 1064 @xmath1 , assigned to @xmath34 in ref.@xcite .",
    "the same actually applies to @xmath22 , which has a strong fermi resonance with @xmath59 + @xmath49 , that has , however , been calculated at a lower value of 644 @xmath1 .",
    "we have also reassigned the first @xmath50 c - h stretch ( mode 1 ) , since the discrepancy between experiment and theory appears too high even for a c - h stretch .",
    "needless to say , this mode also has a strong fermi resonance with the @xmath60 overtone , which has its largest component for the eigenvector with associated eigenvalue at at 3100 @xmath1 , again explaining the experimental value perfectly .",
    "the only other value which is still in question would be a small peak at 1597 @xmath1 , which might correspond to an impurity ; a band was found that was assigned to acetylene , a fragmentation product of 1,2,3-triazine .",
    "the value of 318 @xmath1 , which has been reported for @xmath49 is actually just a scaled hartree - fock harmonic frequency .",
    "+ therefore , a dramatic change in the errors is obtained by reassigning the experimental spectrum . including the c - h stretches in the error analysis , the mean absolute error decreases from 17.7 to 4.7 @xmath1 and the rms error from 27.9 to 6.1 @xmath1 . by excluding the c - h stretches , the mean absolute and rms errors improve from 14.6 and 22.1 @xmath1 , respectively , to 4.1 and 5.2 @xmath1 .",
    "thus , accuracy consistent with the preceding azabenzenes can be obtained following some reassignments in the experimental spectrum .",
    "this also corroborates our conclusion concerning pyridazine that neither substitution of c - h by n nor n - n bonds seem to be responsible for the discrepancies between experimental and computed vibrational spectra .      because 1,2,4-triazine ( figure 1h ) is highly unstable ,",
    "only one `` full '' experimental spectrum has been measured as a liquid film@xcite , although more recently two high - resolution ir spectra have been recorded for four frequencies@xcite . for the c - h stretches ( table [ tab11 ] ) ,",
    "possibly @xmath61 and @xmath53 may have been swapped , since they both take part in a large resonance matrix block .",
    "overall , ten frequencies and combination bands interact forming this large resonance block that include modes 1 to 3 .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that a correct assignment based merely on experimental data would be problematic . with this swap ,",
    "all three c - h stretches are underestimated by the usual 10 - 30 @xmath1 .",
    "only @xmath36 appears questionable in view of our results .",
    "however , @xmath41 has a fermi resonance with the combination of @xmath42 and @xmath30 , and the resonance , eigenvector and eigenvalue matrices are displayed in table [ tab12 ] .",
    "the fermi resonances displayed in these tables are similar to pyrimidine , 1,2,3-triazine and 1,2,4-triazine .",
    "assuming that both of the fermi resonances are slightly stronger than predicted , since @xmath30 is underestimated by 3 @xmath1 compared to the high - resolution ir data , the new @xmath42 + @xmath30 could well end up lower than the predicted 1143 @xmath1 , explaining the value of 1136 @xmath1 that would then not be assigned to any mode .",
    "the assignment of @xmath36 in the experiment would then correspond to @xmath48 , in agreement with the calculated spectrum .",
    "the assignment of @xmath49 also appears to be incorrect .",
    "+ of the four modes obtained by high - resolution ir , the newer data for @xmath17 validates our computational value of 1044 @xmath1 rather than the 1050 @xmath1 predicted by the older experiment . on the other hand , the low - resolution ir value of 769 @xmath1 for mode 19 is closer to the hi - res data compared to our predicted 779 @xmath1 .",
    "these new experiments show the usefulness of the theoretical value , since its resolution is apparently even comparable to that obtained by low - resolution ir data . + without making any reassignments to the experimental spectrum , the mean absolute error from experiment is 13.6 @xmath1 , and the rms error is 19.2 @xmath1 including the c - h stretches .",
    "this appears to be quite large in comparison to the other azabenzenes . with",
    "the abovementioned suggested reassignments , these errors change to 7.5 @xmath1 and 10.0 @xmath1 , respectively . excluding the c - h stretches",
    ", we once again end up with a mean absolute error of 5.1 @xmath1 and an rms error of 5.8 @xmath1 .      for 1,2,4,5-tetrazine ( figure 1i ) , ccsd(t ) harmonic frequencies are available in the literature@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , they were calculated with all electrons correlated in a basis set ( 6 - 311 g * * ) that is only minimal in the inner - shell orbitals .",
    "the resulting errors in harmonic frequencies can easily exceed 20 @xmath1 for small molecules@xcite , several times larger than the actual effect of neglecting core correlation ( typically less than 10 @xmath1 in hcnof systems@xcite ) .",
    "we have recomputed the ccsd(t)/6 - 311 g * * frequencies correlating only valence electrons ( table [ tab13 ] ) . for the in - plane modes , differences with the all - electron calculations",
    "are quite minor ( 6 @xmath1 or less ) .",
    "the out - of - plane modes , however , are drastically affected , up to 60 @xmath1 ( table [ tab13 ] , especially the @xmath62 and the second b@xmath63 frequencies ) .",
    "this adds yet another stanza to the long litany of rejoinders in the literature ( e.g.@xcite ) against the practice of correlating inner - shell electrons in basis sets unsuitable for the purpose .",
    "+ we have recalculated the harmonic frequencies at the ccsd(t ) level ( frozen core ) with basis sets of @xmath0 quality , specifically dunning s popular cc - pvtz @xcite and the almlf - taylor atomic natural orbital@xcite basis set used in ref.@xcite for benzene .",
    "the ccsd(t)/cc - pvtz and ccsd(t)/ano4321 frequencies ( table [ tab13 ] ) are in excellent agreement with each other , the largest difference being 6 @xmath1 for the lowest frequency ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "( this is very unlike the case of benzene@xcite , where the two @xmath52 modes are hypersensitive to the basis set and differ significantly even between cc - pvtz and ano4321 . ) .",
    "the two corresponding modes in s - tetrazine display appreciable differences between 6 - 311 g * and cc - pvtz but barely between cc - pvtz and ano4321 . ) in contrast , the ccsd(t)/6 - 311 g * * frequencies differs significantly from both data sets , particularly for the two @xmath52 modes ( 39 and 33 @xmath1 w.r.t .",
    "ano4321 ) , followed by the lowest @xmath65 mode ( a.k.a . ` kekul mode ' , 27 @xmath1 ) and the @xmath51 mode ( 25 @xmath1 , but a relative error of 7% ) .",
    "so even for a valence - only ccsd(t ) calculation , the 6 - 311 g * * basis set is insufficient , and the rms deviation from the ccsd(t)/ano4321 results , 16.4 @xmath1 ( 17.3 when excluding the c - h stretching frequencies ) , is comparable to that of the much more cost - effective b97 - 1 calculations , 18.1 ( 15.1 ) @xmath1 .",
    "turning now to the b97 - 1/tz2p harmonic frequencies , the most notable differences with the ccsd(t)/ano4321 data are for the ch stretches ( underestimates of 34 @xmath66 for both ) and the kekul mode ( overestimated by 37 @xmath66 ) .",
    "possibly , self - interaction error would adversely affect@xcite the presently used functional s description of the potential surface along the kekul mode , and it would be interesting how a self - interaction corrected functional would perform .",
    "unfortunately no implementation of such a functional is available to the authors , let alone an implementation including analytical derivatives .",
    "exclusive of this mode and the ch stretches , the rms deviation between the ccsd(t)/ano4321 and b97 - 1/tz2p frequencies is about 11 @xmath1 , compared to just 4 @xmath1 for benzene .    as expect ,",
    "agreement between b97 - 1/tz2p fundamentals and experiment is likewise compromised ( table [ tab14 ] ) .",
    "we note that s - tetrazine is both the least stable and the most ` inorganic ' molecule of the series , and that it has a low - lying excited state at less than 2 ev@xcite . if we combine the ccsd(t)/ano4321 harmonic frequencies with the b97 - 1/tz2p anharmonic corrections , the picture brightens somewhat .",
    "compared to the assignment of irm@xcite , the rms deviation amounts to 9.8 @xmath1 if the symmetric c  h stretch is excluded .",
    "the peculiarly large splitting of 76 @xmath1 between irm s symmetric and asymmetric ch stretches is impossible to reconcile with any of our calculations , all of which suggest a very small splitting on the order of just 3 @xmath1 , in agreement with the earlier film ir and raman study of sigworth and pace ( sp)@xcite .",
    "( their band origin of 3089 @xmath1 for the symmetric ch stretch is quite compatible with our calculations : irm s value of 3010 @xmath1 was taken from single - vibronic - level fluorescence spectra@xcite .",
    "an older gas - phase study by franks , merer , and innes ( fmi)@xcite found both ch stretches at 3090 @xmath1 ; the symmetric one in the ir , the antisymmetric one in the raman spectrum . ) our calculations do not reveal a resonance interaction affecting @xmath61 that is severe enough to make a large ch symmetric / antisymmetric spllitting plausible .",
    "we hence conclude that @xmath61 of irm is erroneous .",
    "one other irm assignment which is difficult to reconcile with our best calculations concerns the highest @xmath67 mode ( calculated : 902 , irm : 929 @xmath1 ) for which the franks , merer , and innes@xcite value of 904 @xmath1 nearly perfectly matches our calculation .",
    "it would appear that even the somewhat degraded performance , exhibited by our model for this molecule , still ought to be quite useful for resolving assignment issues or guiding high - resolution spectroscopic measurements .",
    "we have assessed the performance of modern density functional theory ( particularly , b97 - 1/tz2p ) for the anharmonic vibrational spectra of a series of related medium - sized molecules .",
    "the c - h stretching frequencies are consistently underestimated by about 20 - 30 @xmath1 ; disregarding them , the level of agreement with experiment that can be achieved is quite astonishing ( on the order of 6 @xmath1 rms deviation for fundamentals ) .",
    "somewhat poorer accuracy is achieved for pyridazine and particularly for s - tetrazine . for several systems ( particularly 1,2,3-triazine ) , our calculations strongly suggest revised assignments of the observed frequencies . for pyridazine , unfortunately ,",
    "the experimental results are mutually contradictory and our analysis inconclusive . for s - tetrazine",
    ", basically all predicted fundamentals agree less well with experiment ; the more ` inorganic ' character of the molecule may have adversely affected the performance of our calculations .",
    "nevertheless , even here a rms deviation of about 15 @xmath1 for dft and 10 @xmath1 for the combined ccsd(t)/dft results is obtained .",
    "+ overall , b97 - 1/tz2p quartic force fields combined with second - order rovibrational perturbation theory shows great promise for the assignment of vibrational spectra of medium - sized organic molecules .",

    "<S> anharmonic force fields and vibrational spectra of the azabenzene series ( pyridine , pyridazine , pyrimidine , pyrazine , s - triazine , 1,2,3-triazine , 1,2,4-triazine and s - tetrazine ) and benzene are obtained using density functional theory ( dft ) with the b97 - 1 exchange - correlation functional and a triple - zeta plus double polarization ( tz2p ) basis set . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the fundamental frequencies computed by second - order rovibrational perturbation theory are in excellent agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution of the presently calculated anharmonic spectra is such that they represent an extremely useful tool for the assignment and interpretation of the experimental spectra , especially where resonances are involved . </S>"
