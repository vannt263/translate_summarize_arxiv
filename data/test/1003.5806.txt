    "studies of the morphological instabilities of a thin solid films are a first step towards understanding complex phenomena such as the formation of a three - dimensional nanoscale islands in strained alloy heteroepitaxy .",

    "it has been shown that wetting interaction damps long - wave instability modes in a certain range of film thickness , thus changing the instability spectrum from long - wave type to short - wave type .",

    "( wetting stress is called conjoining ( or disjoining ) pressure when studying dynamics of thin _ liquid _ films on substrates @xcite .",

    "here we recognize that the film thickness and the wetting length are two _ independent _ characteristic lengths , i.e. the former length is determined by film deposition , while the latter one is determined by the molecular structure and properties of the film - substrate interface .",
    "since wetting length may be , and normally is , less than the deposited film thickness , the perturbation wavelengths may be comparable to the film thickness but still much larger than the wetting length . in this case",
