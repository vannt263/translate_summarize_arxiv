    "the ongoing heavy ion physics program with the star detector at rhic has accumulated the wealth of experimental data , stimulating important advances in the understanding of properties of hot strongly interacting matter @xcite .",
    "some of the focus areas currently under study are the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of the matter created , in - medium effects on parton propagation , and hadronization mechanisms in qcd matter .",
    "uniform azimuthal acceptance and extended pseudo - rapidity coverage of the star detector is exceptionally suited for studies of jets and jet - medium interactions via triggered and non - triggered correlations .",
    "the data provided quantitative constrains on jet fragmentation and theoretical models of energy loss .",
    "systematic studies of medium effects are advanced by analysis of system size effects on tomographic probes .",
    "data collected with lighter cu ions have expanded those studies by providing additional control over the system size variations .",
    "complimentary data samples at lower beam energy of 62 gev have also allowed systematic studies as function of energy to be performed .",
    "star full capabilities for particle identification in a wide kinematic range have enabled new advances in more quantitative tests of qcd predictions .",
    "different detectors provide complimentary capabilities and coverage .",
    "pions , kaons , electrons and ( anti)protons are identified via their specific ionization energy loss in the time - projection chamber ( tpc ) material at low and high transverse momenta ( @xmath0 ) . in the intermediate momentum range",
    "tpc results are enhanced by the time - of - flight ( tof ) capabilities .",
    "muons can be identified in the muon telescope detector ( mtd ) prototype .",
    "photons at forward rapidities are measured using the photon multiplicity detector ( pmd ) .",
    "weakly decaying strange and multi - strange hadrons are identified geometrically by their decay vertices with the tpc and tof information on decay daughter particles .",
    "short - lived resonances are reconstructed combinatorially by the invariant mass technique .",
    "these capabilities have allowed measuring the yields and transverse momentum spectra addressing a variety of physics topics , including strangeness and heavy flavor production that are of topical interest for this conference .",
    "strangeness enhancement was long thought as one of the signatures for the quark - gluon plasma formation @xcite .",
    "early data suggested that strangeness equilibration is achieved at rhic and that initial collision geometry affects the strangeness systematics . in star studies of the collision geometry effects on strangeness production",
    "is being accomplished by comprehensive analysis of various strange species ( @xmath1,@xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) in light vs. heavy systems at all rhic energies . the latest update on those developments",
    "is reported in @xcite .",
    "new advances in heavy flavor sector afforded by star particle identification capabilities include the measurements of j/@xmath7 spectra and nuclear modification factors in cu+cu collisions , measurements of charm total cross - section for @xmath8 , d+au , au+au and cu+cu systems , new constrains on bottom contribution to heavy flavor from j/@xmath7-hadron and @xmath9-@xmath10 azimuthal correlation studies .",
    "these and other highlights on heavy quark measurements from star are reported in @xcite .",
    "the following two sections will focus on some of the new results from triggered and non - triggered correlation analyses .",
    "elliptic flow results have produced a lot of excitement from the beginning of rhic program .",
    "for the first time in heavy ion collisions the large @xmath11 values reported could be described by ideal hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations successful in description of flow results indicated the values of the shear viscosity over the entropy ratio consistent with the expectations for strongly interacting medium  @xcite .",
    "although recent work seem to question the applicability of ideal hydro  @xcite , most theories agree that the matter created at rhic is extremely dense , with the hydrodynamic description applicability limits extending to higher @xmath0 for more central collisions .",
    "flow results provide strong indications for partonic nature of the medium : constituent quark scaling observed for all measured hadron species ( including @xmath6 and @xmath5 with their small hadronic interaction cross - sections ) points on relevance of partonic degrees of freedom at hadronization  @xcite .",
    "similar results are observed in the cu+cu collisions although the overall @xmath11 values are lower at a given centrality for the cu+cu compared to au+au at the same energy .",
    "new result reported recently by star on non - triggered two - particle correlations provide independent means to extract and cross - check azimuthal anisotropy parameters , but also to characterize other processes that induce relative angular correlations between the particles pairs . in this analysis di - hadron correlation formed with no transverse momentum restrictions on either hadron",
    "is used to study centrality evolution of characteristic structures in relative azimuth and pseudo - rapidity .",
    "it has been shown that the resulting correlation can be decomposed into a few structures , and information related to the individual sources can be extracted  @xcite . per - particle",
    "pair densities for various centrality bins of 200  gev minimum bias au+au data sample are shown in figure 1 .",
    "minijet contribution , measured as the same - side two - dimensional gaussian correlation structure , was found to exhibit a threshold behavior .",
    "while approximate binary scaling is observed from @xmath8 and most peripheral au+au to mid - central collisions , a sharp transition is found for both 200 and 62 gev au+au data at about 55% and 40% event centrality , respectively . as shown in figure 2 , from this point",
    "the minijet peak amplitude exhibits rapid growth and the peak width in relative pseudo - rapidity broadens by more than a factor of 2 . here",
    "the transverse density , calculated as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is initial collision overlap area s from glauber model , is used as a centrality measure .",
    "also shown in figure 2 is the total yield or `` volume '' of the minijet peak .",
    "it is estimated to include approximately one third of all produced particles in central collisions .",
    "novel features have been also observed by star in the triggered correlations .",
    "early results on the disappearance of away - side jet ( in certain kinematic range ) unambiguously established the presence of the jet quenching phenomena at rhic @xcite .",
    "experimental observations are found to be consistent with theoretical expectations for partonic energy loss @xcite , prompting more studies of the mechanisms of jet - medium interactions .",
    "two - dimensional study of the correlation structures for charged hadrons associated with a high-@xmath0 trigger shows shape modifications in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 dimensions compared to a @xmath8 reference . within a two - component approach the intermediate @xmath0 structure",
    "can be decomposed into a jet - like part , and the so - called `` ridge '' .",
    "the jet part appears similar in shape to the structures seen in @xmath8 data , while `` ridge '' resembles properties of the bulk medium .",
    "left panel of figure 3 illustrates the ridge - long range @xmath15 structure accompanying the jet peak in central 200 gev au+au collisions@xcite .",
    "jet - medium interaction is likely to be the origin of the ridge formation and modification of the jet - like peaks .",
    "di - hadron correlations with identified hadrons provide additional means to study parton propagation in the medium .",
    "measurements of identified particle spectra and ratios for associated hadrons in the jet cones and ridges could address the issues of color - charge dependence of energy loss , presence of meson / baryon effects and interplay between various hadronization scenarios .",
    "strong enhancement of baryon production at intermediate momentum range in inclusive measurements was theorized as an evidence for quark coalescence . however , in azimuthal correlations with the hyperon - triggers significant jet - like structures were observed for all species of hyperons ( including @xmath6 )  @xcite , which contradicts initial expectations from coalescence picture .",
    "associated hadron yields in ( multi)strange hadron correlations show no dependence on strangeness content . following those observations , a medium response to the propagating parton or `` phantom jet '' was proposed to accommodate the data within the coalescence picture  @xcite .",
    "this theoretical explanation preserves the correlation in azimuthal space and produces ridge - like structure in pseudo - rapidity . to confront the models and further the understanding of physics mechanisms producing the ridge , it was essential to extend the correlation studies into @xmath15-@xmath14 space separately for baryons and mesons .",
    "preliminary star results show significant differences in strange ( central panel of figure 3 ) and non - strange ( figure 3 , right ) baryon to meson ratios measured in jet part around a 4 gev/@xmath16 triggers , with respect to the ridge part .",
    "the jet - part ratios for @xmath17 and @xmath18 are found to be significantly lower in central au+au collisions compared to non - triggered distributions , and are consistent with the inclusive ratios from 200 gev @xmath8 data  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the ridge ratios suggest relative baryon enhancement for both strange and non - strange species , which might be related to direct fragmentation of the gluons , radiated of the hard - scattered quark , or their subsequent recombination with the medium partons .",

    "a jet - like peak is observed in all three correlations at small relative pseudo - rapidity values .",
    "in addition , a uniform distribution of associated yields is observed in au+au collisions , particularly , for most central events .",
    "this observation is quite puzzling for ridge phenomenology , contradicting to model predictions  @xcite .",
    "specifically we note the absence of axial strips in the correlation structure .",
    "axial strips in three - particle correlation should be formed by associate hadron pairs , in which one of the hadrons is coming from the cone - part , and the other one - from the ridge .",
    "absence of these strips thus suggests complete decoupling of jet and ridge events .",
    "albeit the current statistic limitations , these early results have already provided more stringent constraints on the interpretation of ridge formation .",

    "experimental techniques for such reconstruction have been successfully used in elementary collision experiments .",
    "recently full jet reconstruction was attempted for the first time for heavy ion events  @xcite .",
    "a combination of charged hadron measurements from the tpc and neutral energy measurements from electro - magnetic calorimeter were utilized in star for this analysis .",
    "left panel of figure 5 depicts a 47  gev single jet from 20% central high - tower triggered ( ht ) au+au data of 200 gev .",
    "the aim of this analysis is to quantify the jet energy loss by detailed studies of possible modification in the fragmentation functions due to quenching effects in au+au with respect to @xmath8 reference measurements .",
    "preliminary results from this study are shown in the right panel of figure 5 , where fragmentation functions , defined as @xmath21 , are compared for two colliding systems .",
    "no modification in the fragmentation functions in excess of 10 - 20% is observed within the uncertainties from utilizing the current jet finding algorithms and background subtraction procedures .",
    "this preliminary conclusion depends heavily on the assumptions of pythia fragmentation , and could be additionally affected by the bias induced in the jet - sample by applying background - suppressing analysis cuts .",

    "the phase diagram , defined in terms of temperature ( t ) with respect to the baryon chemical potential ( @xmath22 ) , is believed to contain a number of phase boundaries , including the one that separates qgp partonic degrees of freedom from the ordinary ( hadronic gas ) matter .",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) predicts that in zero-@xmath22 limit the phase transition occurs as a smooth cross - over , while at higher @xmath22 values it is expected to be a first order transition . a critical point ( cp )",
    "is expected on a phase diagram , marking the location where qgp phase transition will change from a cross - over to a first order transition . in the absence of analytical solution",

    "novel phenomena , such as constituent quark scaling of the elliptic flow , hadron suppression at high-@xmath0 sigh signal the onset of deconfinment . from theory ,",
    "the divergences are expected for the baryon number and the net charge susceptibilities , as well as for the specific heat near the critical point .",
    "such divergences might lead to large fluctuations in a number of physical parameters , including baryon number density , quark number , and charge , which could be observed experimentally in hadronic yields , net - charge and mean-@xmath0 fluctuations , as well as particle ratios ( @xmath23 , @xmath17 , etc ) .",
