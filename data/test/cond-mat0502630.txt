    "the small discrepancies seen in figs .",
    "[ fig_vx_osci ] and [ fig_vx_step ] may be attributed to the relatively small @xmath22 ( @xmath162 ) , the nonuniform boundary - layer fluid , and the relatively fast variation of @xmath5 ( especially in the sinusoidal case ) .",
    "consider a chemically patterned surface composed of a periodic array of stripes parallel to the @xmath24 axis .",
    "each stripe is of type @xmath163 or @xmath164 , and the periodicity along the @xmath1 direction is realized by arranging the stripes according to @xmath165 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_pattern ] ) .",
    "this way of patterning has been modeled in md simulations by a stepwise modulation of fluid - solid interaction , and the md and continuum results agree well ( see fig . [ fig_vx_step ] ) .",
    "the continuum model uses two different slip lengths @xmath166 and @xmath167 for the @xmath163 and @xmath164 stripes , respectively .",
    "while the chemical property of each stripe is kept invariant , the surface pattern may be continuously changed by varying the stripe widths . with",
    "the two slip lengths fixed , continuum flow fields have been calculated for stripe widths varied in a wide range .",
    "it is found that the slip behavior can continuously change from the regime of distinct slip domains ( for large stripe widths ) to the regime of effective medium ( for small stripe widths , with an effective slip length showing up ) .",
    "note that in the latter regime , the stripe widths , though small compared to the slip length , are still considered large enough to justify the validity of the continuum model .",
    "the effective - medium regime provides a way to systematically tune the effective slip length . a desired slip length ,",
    "if not naturally produced at a chemically homogeneous surface , can thus be realized at a patterned surface .",
    "continuum hydrodynamic calculations have been carried out for couette flow between two solid planar surfaces parallel to the @xmath0 plane .",
    "the lower surface is patterned and the upper surface is homogeneous .",
    "the fluid is sheared by fixing the lower surface and translating the upper surface at a constant velocity @xmath23 in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "we focus on the regime of viscous flow with small reynolds numbers ( @xmath168 , where @xmath22 is the distance between the two solid surfaces ) . with the fluid velocity @xmath169 measured by @xmath23 and the coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath46 measured by @xmath22 , the scaled steady - state velocity fields , @xmath170 , are controlled by the dimensionless parameters @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 , where @xmath175 and @xmath176 are the widths of @xmath163 and @xmath164 stripes , respectively .",
    "figures [ fig_slip_pattern1 ] and [ fig_slip_pattern2 ] show the steady - state slip profiles at six differently patterned surfaces , obtained for @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "the values of @xmath173 and @xmath174 have been varied to show the control of an effective slip length by surface patterning . in the present couette - flow geometry , the slip velocity has to oscillate in the @xmath1 direction at the lower surface , where the slip length is modeled as a periodic function of @xmath1 according to the surface patterning . from fig .",
    "[ fig_slip_pattern1 ] , it is obvious that the slip velocity becomes less oscillatory in magnitude when the pattern period @xmath39 is decreased .",
    "in fact , for @xmath179 and @xmath180 , the relative magnitude of oscillation for @xmath63 , defined as @xmath181 , becomes @xmath182 and @xmath183 , respectively , while for @xmath184 , that oscillation magnitude is @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , when the solid surface is patterned with a sufficiently small period , it appears to be homogeneous . the nearly uniform slip velocity can be used to define an effective slip length @xmath186 . for the present couette flow ,",
    "it is given by @xmath187 which yields @xmath188 from the data in fig .",
    "[ fig_slip_pattern1 ] .",
    "for sufficiently small pattern period @xmath39 , the effective slip length can be further tuned by varying the ratio of the @xmath163 stripes ( with a small slip length ) to the @xmath164 stripes ( with a large slip length ) .",
    "figure [ fig_slip_pattern2 ] shows that by fixing @xmath189 at @xmath190 and increasing the proportion of the @xmath163 stripes , the average amount of slip is appreciably reduced .",

    "in this paper we have used both the md and continuum simulations to study the slip boundary condition for single - phase flow past a chemically patterned surface .",
    "modulation of fluid - solid interaction along the patterned surface induces a lateral variation in various stresses and forces in the fluid .",
    "this has been observed in both the static equilibrium state and the dynamic steady state .",
    "given this lateral variation , a subtraction scheme has been developed for extracting hydrodynamic quantities from md simulations . based on this scheme , the validity of the navier boundary condition has been verified in describing the local hydrodynamic viscous coupling between the fluid and the patterned solid surface .",
    "a continuum hydrodynamic model has been formulated .",
    "it is capable of yielding steady - state flow fields in quantitative agreement with those from md simulations .",
    "we have used the continuum model to show that an effective slip length can be realized and tuned by surface patterning .",
    "the framework of heterogeneous multiscale method @xcite provides a general scheme for developing hybrid atomistic - continuum methods .",
    "the hybrid methods use md to extract boundary condition(s ) and/or constitutive relation(s ) for continuum calculation .",
    "whatever a continuum calculation needs , the relevant hydrodynamic quantities have to be properly extracted from md data . in the present problem , we see that a subtraction of the static component from the dynamic quantity is essential to obtaining the correct hydrodynamic information .",
    "we emphasize that hybrid methods are mostly used to investigate problems involving complex fluids , complex fluid - solid interactions , and/or complex geometries , while in such problems , the static configurations are usually nontrivial in a molecular point of view .",

    "we would like to thank prof .",
    "weinan e and dr . weiqing ren for helpful discussion .",
    "the md results presented in this paper were obtained from simulations using solid walls constructed by two [ 001 ] planes of an fcc lattice . we have also carried out md simulations using thicker confining walls .",
    "the number of crystalline layers ( [ 001 ] planes of fcc lattice ) is changed from two to four in constructing each of the two walls .",
    "the fluid - solid interaction potential @xmath43 is then cut off at a larger distance @xmath191 .",
    "it turned out that both the velocity field and the stress field remain essentially the same .",
    "in terms of the tangential wall force density @xmath192 , we define the tangential wall force per unit area in a horizontal layer as @xmath193 , which is the total tangential wall force accumulated across that layer , sandwiched between @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "the wall force can be singled out by separating the force on each fluid molecule into fluid - solid and fluid - fluid components .",
    "the fluid molecules close to the crystalline wall experience a _ fast _ periodic modulation in interaction with the wall .",
    "when coupled with kinetic collisions with the wall molecules , there arises the first component in the tangential wall force , sharply distributed along @xmath46 close to the wall . in the presence of a periodically varied fluid - solid interaction ( at the lower fluid - solid interface , with a period much larger than that of the crystalline structure ) , the second component in the tangential wall force",
    "arises along with a _ slow _ oscillation of fluid molecules distribution .",
    "this component is also narrowly distributed along @xmath46 near the wall , but with a distribution width larger than that of the first component .",
    "this may be understood as follows .",
    "two quite different periods exist in the periodic modulation in fluid molecules interaction with the wall .",
    "the first period is from the crystalline structure of the wall . for a fluid molecule close to the solid wall",
    ", the interaction with one particular ( the closest ) wall molecule can be much stronger than all the others .",
    "as this fluid molecule moves laterally but remaining close to the wall , it would thus experience a strong periodic modulation in its interaction with the wall .",
    "this lateral inhomogeneity is generally referred to as the `` roughness '' of the wall potential @xcite .",
    "away from the fluid - solid interface , each fluid molecule can interact with many wall molecules on a nearly equal basis .",
    "thus the modulation amplitude of the wall potential would clearly decrease with increasing distance from the wall .",
    "hence the first component of the tangential wall force tends to saturate at a relatively short range . the second period ,",
    "being much larger than the first one , comes directly from the fluid - solid interaction potential . as a consequence",
    ", the distribution of fluid molecules would be periodically adjusted along the wall .",
    "this occurs within a relatively long distance from the surface , as determined by the range of fluid - solid interaction and the correlation length of fluid .",
    "therefore , the second component of the tangential wall force has a wider distribution than the first one .",
    "the irving - kirkwood expression @xcite has been widely used for stress measurement in md simulations . however , as pointed out by the authors themselves , the leading - order expression for the interaction contribution to the stress tensor represents only the leading term in an asymptotic expansion , accurate when the interaction range is small compared to the range of hydrodynamic variation . as a consequence ,",
    "this leading - order expression is not reliable near a fluid - fluid or a fluid - solid interface . in this paper ,",
    "the stress components @xmath59 and @xmath60 are obtained from the time averages of the kinetic momentum transfer plus the fluid - fluid interaction forces across the fixed @xmath1 and @xmath46 bin surfaces .",
    "in particular , we directly measure the @xmath1 component of the fluid - fluid interaction forces acting across the @xmath66 bin surfaces , in order to obtain the @xmath196 component of @xmath197 , the interaction contribution to the stress tensor @xmath198 . here `` acting across '' means that the line connecting a pair of molecules intersects the bin surface ( the so - called irving - kirkwood convention @xcite ) . for more details , see appendix b in ref .",
