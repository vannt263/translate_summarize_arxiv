    "observational studies of the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution mostly concentrate on galaxies in rich clusters , even though @xmath5% of galaxies are found in such environments .",
    "most galaxies are found in groups , and arguably the group environment plays an important role in their evolution . in groups , galaxies could be transformed by their interaction with the intragroup medium , or with other galaxies by means of a variety of processes ( e.g. stripping , tidal interaction ) or through merging with other galaxies . here",
    "we seek to study the optical and near - ir properties of galaxies in groups to find whether they support the relative importance of any of these processes .",
    "we explore the optical properties of galaxies in a sample of 60 nearby groups , known as the group evolution multi - wavelength study ( gems , detailed descriptions in @xcite .",
    "this sample represents a variety of groups over a large range of evolutionary stages , and are all in the fields of @xmath6  ks of rosat pspc observations ( some of them are not detected ) . as a description of the group environment ,",
    "we use their bolometric x - ray luminosity @xmath7 , and divide the sample into two subsamples : x - ray bright if @xmath8 erg  s@xmath9 , and x - ray dim if less ( including the undetected ones ) .",
    "this x - ray luminosity refers to that of the group plus any central galaxy that might exist ( for more details , see @xcite . ) .",
    "the optical subsample consists of 25 gems groups : 17 of them were observed at the 2.5 m int , la palma , with the wfc , imaging an area of @xmath10 arcmin of sky with bvi filters .",
    "another 8 groups were observed with the 2.2 m eso / mpi telescope at la  silla , chile , using the wfi , with a field of @xmath11 arcmin , with broadband bri filters . for each group",
    ", we went out to a radius of @xmath12 from their centres .",
    "furthermore , we extracted jhk magnitudes of all 60 gems groups from the 2mass all - sky extended source catalog ( 2masx ) , going out to a radius @xmath3 of its centre for each group , down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath13 .",
    "the adopted group centres , values of @xmath3 and distances to these groups can be found in @xcite , and details of member selection and data reduction in @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : cumulf ] , we show the cumulative @xmath14-band luminosity function ( lf ) for our optical subsample ( 25 gems groups ) , evaluated by co - adding galaxies of several groups in equally spaced bins of absolute luminosity , with galaxies chosen from within @xmath2 from the centre of each group .",
    "this reveals that the lf of the x - ray dim groups ( @xmath15 erg  s@xmath9 ) is significantly different from that of the x - ray brighter groups .",
    "[ fig : difflf ] shows the differential lfs , ( left ) for the @xmath14-band , within @xmath2 ( same data as fig .  [",
    "fig : cumulf ] ) , and ( right ) for the @xmath16-band , within @xmath3 .",
    "the differential lfs reveal the nature of the difference , in the form of a prominent dip , at around @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( more details of observational data in @xcite ) .",
    "we interpret this deficiency of intermediate luminosity galaxies as evidence of rapid evolution through merging . in the low velocity dispersion environment",
    ", as in x - ray dim groups , dynamical friction would facilitate more rapid merging , thus depleting intermediate luminosity galaxies to form more giant central galaxies .",
    "since the collision cross - section depends on the size of a galaxy , the dwarf galaxies at the faint end of the lf are more likely to merge with a giant galaxy , than merge with each other .",
    "this ensures galaxies in a range of intermediate luminosities are preferentially depleted , thus enhancing the bright end of the lf .",
    "we suggest that x - ray dim ( or low velocity dispersion ) groups are the present sites of rapid dynamical evolution rather than their x - ray bright counterparts , and may be the modern precursors of fossil groups .",
    "such lf features are seen in some clusters as well , such as coma ( e.g. @xcite ) , which we would argue has resulted from recent merger with groups .",
    "the optical lfs are determined only out to @xmath2 of each group , but we can investigate the nature of the lf in their outer parts from the near - ir lfs from the 2mass survey .",
    "we consider three ranges of radial distance in finding the the mean @xmath16-band lf in fig .",
    "[ fig : lfrad ] .",
    "the dip between @xmath19 seen in the lf in the central regions of the groups gradually disappears as the lf is averaged out to larger radii , approaching @xmath3 , where the lfs of both x - ray bright and dim groups are of a similar shape .",
    "one of the consequences of this scenario is that the brightest group galaxies in the x - ray dim groups are expected to be more massive and brighter than those in x - ray bright groups .",
    "[ fig : lxmm2 ] shows the colour of galaxies as a function of radial distance , stacked in radial bins scales by @xmath3 , to reveal that x - ray dim groups have redder central galaxies .",
    "it also shows that in x - ray bright groups , the difference in @xmath14-magnitude between their brightest and second brightest galaxies is in general smaller than in x - ray faint groups .",
    "the x - ray bright groups have several galaxies of comparable luminosity ( and mass ) at the bright end , possibly being the end - products of earlier mergers on smaller scales in sub - groups that were incorporated in the virialised systems we observe today .",
    "we argue that the missing intermediate - luminosity galaxies in the optical and near - infrared luminosity functions of x - ray dim groups indicate that , in the dynamically sluggish environment of such groups ( which have low velocity disperison ) , dynamical friction would facilitate more rapid merging , thus depleting intermediate - luminosity galaxies to form a few giant central galaxies . we also show that this effect is seen only in the interior regions of the groups ( @xmath20 ) , and vanishes as one approaches @xmath3 . rather than a bright - end enhancement caused by excess star formation .",
    "in @xcite , we show that this feature can not arise due to enhanced star formation in the brightest galaxies , or due to a varying morphological mix of galaxies in various groups .",
    "it is often suggested ( e.g. @xcite ) that mergers are not an important ingredient of galaxy evolution in the recent universe ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "here we have shown that in nearby poor groups , merging is still an important process .",
    "this picture of galaxy evolution leads to a definite prediction .",
    "if x - ray dim groups are indeed systems undergoing rapid dynamical evolution , the stellar populations in their galaxies would be significantly younger than those in x - ray bright groups in case of dissipative merging . this can be observationally verified ."
