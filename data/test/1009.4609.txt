    "there is a significant interest in constructing simple stochastic models with avalanches reflecting properties of various natural phenomena , but only part of them have the advantage of being solvable .",
    "one way to make models analytically tractable is to use the mean - field approximation .",
    "however , requirements of exact results can force further simplifications in a model . for example , in terms of self - organized criticality , in spite of the fact that the mean field theory of such critical phenomena was already proposed @xcite , dhar made further simplifications for distinguished btw model @xcite ( a unified view of mean - field picture of stochastic self - organized critical models is presented in @xcite ) .",
    "we point out also that considering structure of abelian algebras leads to analytical results in some sand - pile and related stochastic models @xcite .",
    "solvable simple models can also be constructed in the field of directed percolation ; for an extremely simple one , see @xcite .",
    "another way towards solvability is to consider stochastic properties as non - essential and study deterministic models ; see such an approach for sand - pile in @xcite . in the context of deterministic cellular automata , an analytic approach related to solvability is investigated as part of the theory of integrable systems and may employ sophisticated methods .",
    "we underline that construction of integrable cellular automata is definitely not an easy task .",
    "our aim here is to follow the ideas of analytic approach and apply them to construction of _ stochastic _ automata . in the article",
    "we propose and analyse in a direct elementary way the random domino automaton ( rda ) - a new slowly driven systems exhibiting avalanche phenomena .",
    "we prefer here an elementary self - contained approach to the description of the automaton and we make no use of applicable markov processes terminology .",
    "we stress here , all results , except of equation ( see @xcite for details ) , have elementary derivation in the text below . on the other hand , in spite of its simple formulation and being analytically tractable",
    ", automaton covers wide range of behaviours depending on the choice of the parameters .",
    "the application of the rda model for studying ito equation is investigated in our parallel papers @xcite .    an inspiration for defining the rule for",
    "the domino automaton comes from very simplified view of earthquakes .",
    "it corresponds to two tectonic plates moving with relative constant velocity",
    ". the wedge may be irregularly rough , and relative motion can be locked in some places , producing stress accumulation . beyond some threshold of stress ,",
    "a relaxation took place .",
    "the size of relaxation depends on the nearby accumulated stress .",
    "rda is inspired by earthquakes ; however , a direct reproducing of realistic - like behaviour of such complicated phenomena is obviously beyond its scope in the present form .",
    "nevertheless , construction and analysis of models is one of primary aims in geosciences @xcite .",
    "there are many very simplified cellular automata models focusing on specific features of the investigated behaviour in the field . here",
    "we point out a sequence of papers @xcite , where some interesting cellular automata models were presented .    finally , as an unexpected property we mention an interesting link between stochastic cellular automata and integer sequences ( see @xcite or the on - line encyclopedia of integer sequences ) .",
    "it is known , how to obtain catalan numbers out of the bond directed percolation on a square lattice @xcite .",
    "our cellular automaton in specific case leads to motzkin numbers ( for details see @xcite )",
    ".    plan of the article is as follows . in section [ sec : autdef ]",
    "we introduce a definition of random domino automaton with rebound parameters .",
    "section [ sec : eqs ] contains full combinatorial derivation of equations for the distribution of clusters , which describes stationary state of the automaton .",
    "several exact formulas - balance relations , average size of clusters and avalanche , general formula for all moments - are displayed .",
    "we finish with introducing special form of rebound parameters , which leads to two distinguished special cases studied in details in next section [ sec : speccases ] .",
    "these cases correspond to exponential and inverse - power distributions as shown below .",
    "the obtained analytical results are compared with simulations .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] gives a resume of results presented in the article as well as directions for future work .",
    "appendix [ app : empty_cl_derv ] contains derivation of complementary set of equations , describing empty clusters of the automaton .",
    "in the random domino automaton model , the space consists of discrete number @xmath0 of cells on a line , and we assume periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each cell may be in one of two states : empty state , when it is empty , or occupied state , when contains a ball .",
    "the evolution of the automaton is given by the following update procedure performed in each discrete time step .",
    "a ball is added to the system to the randomly chosen cell and we assume each cell to be equally possible .",
    "if the chosen cell is empty , there are two possibilities : it becomes occupied with probability @xmath1 or the ball is rebounded with probability @xmath2 leaving the state of the automaton unchanged . if the chosen place is already occupied , there are also two possibilities : the ball is rebounded with probability @xmath3 or with probability @xmath4 the incoming ball triggers a relaxation . by relaxation",
    "we mean : balls from the chosen cell and from all its adjacent occupied cells are removed .",
    "thus , the relaxation produces an avalanche of size equal to the number of cells changing their state . then the update procedure repeats in the next time step .",
    "all possibilities are shown schematically on the diagram below .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the average size of a cluster is the same as the average size of an avalanche , because any cluster , regardless of its size , has the same chance to become an avalanche .",
    "hence , both balance equations lead to the same result @xmath5 table [ tab : table2 ] contains values of average density and average cluster / avalanche size obtained from equations and simulation in an exemplary case where @xmath6 .",
    "the size of lattice is set to @xmath7 in order to avoid restrictions for size of avalanches , which are relatively bigger comparing to the previous case .    a simple form of @xmath8 together with balance equations and alows to reduce the set of equations - to the solvable recurrence .",
    "the formulas for @xmath9s are rational functions of @xmath10 and @xmath0 only .",
    "the explicit form of solutions and relation to the motzkin numbers is presented in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : figb ] presents exact values of @xmath9s compared in log - log scale with the simulation result in the exemplary case described above .",
    "the slope of the distribution of @xmath9 approximates inverse - power distribution in the middle part of a range of sizes @xmath11 ; for bigger values of @xmath11 , values of @xmath9 decrease quicker .",
    "this property agrees with convergence of moments of @xmath9 we use above . for value of @xmath10",
    "closer to @xmath12 the straight part of the plot extends for bigger values of @xmath11 . in the limit case @xmath13 ,",
    "the distribution is given by the following power law @xcite @xmath14",
    "we proposed and studied properties of simple stochastic cellular automaton with avalanches inspired by an extremely simplified model of earthquakes .",
    "the main goal was to construct a simple model with `` transparent '' mathematical structure , which would enable obtaining exact results yet covering a wide range of behaviours .",
    "the rule of the automaton allows to derive from the first principles ( using elementary combinatorics ) the set of equations describing the average values of the model parameters .",
    "these equations leads to equations for moments and to neat formulas for average cluster and avalanche sizes in terms of the zero and the first moments .",
    "after analysis of moment equations , we considered in detail two cases which differ by the form of parameter @xmath15 responsible for triggering of avalanches .",
    "we obtained exponential type and inverse - power type distributions of clusters within uniform framework .",
    "( the distribution of avalanches @xmath16 is easily obtained from the formula @xmath17 . )",
    "the quasi - equilibrium assumption seems to be justified by simulation results .",
    "the exponential case @xmath18 is not fully analytically solvable ; nevertheless , the closed set of equations leads to several exact relations .",
    "moreover , an approximate formula for @xmath9 was derived , and intimate relation to percolation was pointed out . hence , the proposed approach can be regarded as an extension of percolation approximation results , and can provide basis for exact treatment of other models .",
    "the automaton rule clearly states that there is a `` coupling '' between the adjacent cells , since the relaxations takes out the whole cluster , so treating cluster  not cells  as independent is a substantial improvement in the presented case .",
    "the case @xmath19 is fully solvable , and all variables are expressed as rational functions of ratio @xmath20 of rebound parameters only .",
    "the shape of the distribution of clusters @xmath9 approximate an inverse - power distribution in the various ranges of variable @xmath11 , depending on chosen parameters . in the limit case",
    ", distribution tends to @xmath21 .",
    "the critical density is equal to @xmath22 .",
    "the limit case of the presented automaton reduces the set of equations to the recurrence , which leads to known integer sequence - the motzkin numbers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this result establishes a new , remarkable link between the combinatorial object and the stochastic cellular automaton .    the first application of rda - related to ito equation - is already studied in our parallel papers @xcite .",
    "the model serves as a fully controlled stochastic `` phenomenon '' and an applicability of the reconstruction of the ito equation from generated time series was tested . due to its simplicity , it allows to derive exactly the suitable ito equation , and analytical results were compared with histogram method .",
    "the obtained results are part of broader studies of the privilege concept and its role for appearance of inverse - power distributions @xcite",
    ".    the model posses also some properties which may be used in seeking of applications to natural phenomena and checking their adequacy .",
    "for example , in the context of earthquakes , the discrete nature of the model makes possible an adjustment of positions and sizes of cells to the geological structure of a fault .",
    "bending and shrinking of the 1-d grid have no influence on equations ; the only important feature is an order of cells . in this context , relations describing average size of cluster @xmath23 and avalanche @xmath24 may be interpreted as relations giving their dependence on the density of energy on the wedge .",
    "the model establishes one - to - one correspondence between distribution of avalanches ( i.e. observable quantity ) and respective parameter @xmath25 responsible for triggering avalanches , as it was illustrated in two cases considered above .",
    "we emphasize that the relation works in both directions .",
    "fixing rebound parameters leads to various distributions of avalanches , but also , for any distribution @xmath9 , one can easily find unique values of rebound parameters @xmath25 by simple use of the set of equations - .",
    "thus , within the proposed model , one can infer about triggering properties from `` observed '' statistics of avalanches . for an earthquake interpretation , it would give an insight into properties of microscopic mechanism of releasing energy on a fault on the basis of already collected data .",
    "last but not least , we propose few generalizations possibly leading towards more realistic extensions of the model .",
    "each element of the presented automaton - including the incidence rule - can be subjected to various modifications . to be more specific , one can consider different geometry of the array ( for example , a tree shaped like bethe lattice or any in bigger dimension ) , different capacities of cells and different kinds of balls distributed to the system .",
    "also there are many kinds of dependence of energy release threshold on other parameters ( on space position , on states of cells in a neighbourhood etc . ) .",
    "we leave these topics for further investigations .",
    "in analogy to the set of equations - for clusters , one can deduce the following set of equations for the empty clusters .    * losses .",
    "* there are two following possibilities . + *",
    "( a ) * occupation of any cell belonging to the empty @xmath26-cluster .",
    "the probability is just @xmath27 * ( b ) * provoking an avalanche .",
    "an empty cluster of the length @xmath26 is lost when one of the two adjacent clusters is knocked out and forms an avalanche . @xmath28",
    "the probability is @xmath29 it comes from the probability of knocking out of @xmath11-cluster times the probability that on the end of the cluster is empty @xmath26-cluster , times two ends , summed for all possible values of @xmath11 .",
    "* gains . *",
    "again , there are two possibilities .",
    "+ * ( a ) * shortening an empty cluster . an empty cluster of a length @xmath26 can be obtained from a bigger one of the length @xmath30 when an incoming ball hits its @xmath31th empty cell @xmath32 or symmetrically , its @xmath33th cell .",
    "hence the relevant gain term is of the form @xmath34 * ( b ) * provoking an avalanche .",
    "if an incoming ball knock out the cluster of the length @xmath35 surrounded by two empty clusters of the respective lengths @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 then the empty cluster of the length @xmath26 is created .",
    "therefore , for @xmath39 this leads to the following term @xmath40 this is the probability of knocking out of the @xmath41-cluster times probability the @xmath42-empty cluster is on the left times probability the empty @xmath43-cluster is on the right , for all possible values of @xmath42 .",
    "* balance equations . *",
    "the set of equations for the average values in the quasi equilibrium is of the form @xmath44 equation may be written as @xmath45 and equation , valid for @xmath46 is @xmath47 thus , on right hand sides there are terms @xmath48 with @xmath49 only .",
    "* balance of @xmath50 out of empty clusters . * the set of equation for empty clusters can be treated by methods we use in subsection [ ssec : mom ] in order to derive relations for respective moments .",
    "below we consider zero moment for @xmath51 , which leads also to equation .",
    "this is implied by the fact that the number of empty clusters is equal to the number of clusters ( see equation ) . to perform sum of and for",
    "all values of @xmath26 notice the following identities : @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the last identity we assumed that it is allowed to change the order of summation with respect to indices @xmath41 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus , a sum of and for all @xmath26 leads directly to @xmath55 it is the balance equation already obtained .",
