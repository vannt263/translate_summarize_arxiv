    "we performed rapid optical photometry and optical spectroscopy for ch cygni between 1997 and 2000 .",
    "our observations cover several interesting phases . in 1997 , ch cygni produced a radio jet after a drop in the optical flux ( * ? ? ? *",
    "observations from this period are discussed in sokoloski & kenyon 2003 ; hereafter paper i ) . in 1998",
    ", it entered a high activity state ; in 1999 , the hot source was eclipsed by the red giant ( according to * ? ? ?",
    "the properties of the optical flickering changed during each of these phases , and in combination with the optical spectra , these changes provide information about the accretion disk during jet production , the nature of the high activity state , and the timing of the eclipse .",
    "this paper is divided into six sections .",
    "after the initial description of the observations in  [ sec : obs ] , we report the results from our fast photometry in  [ sec : results ] . in  [ sec : eclipse ] , we discuss the disappearance of all minute- to hour - time - scale variations during the proposed eclipse of the accreting wd by the red giant in 1999 . in ",
    "[ sec : mag ] , we describe the timing analysis of the light curves . no coherent or quasi - periodic oscillations were found , and we discuss the difficulty for magnetic propeller models of ch cygni in the face of this lack of evidence for a strong magnetic field . in  [ sec : activity ] , we suggest that the activity in ch cyg may instead be driven by an unstable accretion disk .",
    "we performed high - time - resolution optical differential photometry at @xmath0 and at @xmath2 , using the 1-meter nickel telescope at lick observatory , on 14 nights between 1997 and 2000 ( see sokoloski , bildsten , & ho 2001 for description of observing technique and instruments ) .",
    "eclipses in the best comparison star , sao 31628 ( see sokoloski & stone 2000 ) , affected 3 of the 14 observations . to obtain a uniform , high - quality set of light curves with this comparison star",
    ", we divided its light curves on 1998 july 22 and 2000 june 22 by a 6th - order - polynomial fit to the eclipse profile .",
    "this correction added only a small amount of power to the power spectrum of the ch cygni observations , as measured by computing the power spectrum of the ratio of sao 31628 and a second comparison star in the field .",
    "this slight extra power only appeared at the lowest frequencies , and did not hamper our search for coherent oscillations .",
    "it also did not diminish our ability to measure the power - law slope on 22 july 1998 since it was insignificant compared to the actual broad - band power due to intrinsic variations from ch cygni . on 1999",
    "july 3 , the sao 31628 eclipse only affected the last 80 minutes of a 6-hr light curve , so the affected portion of the data was not used .",

    "p. berlind , m. calkins , and several other observers acquired low resolution optical spectra of ch cygni with fast , a high throughput , slit spectrograph mounted at the fred l. whipple observatory 1.5-m telescope on mount hopkins , arizona @xcite .",

    "most of the resulting spectra have moderate signal - to - noise , s / n @xmath8 30 per pixel .",
    "our high - time - resolution light curves demonstrate tremendous diversity in both amplitude and frequency content ( see figure  [ fig : alllcs ] ) .",
    "the observations from 1997 show low - amplitude ( @xmath9 mag ) variations that initially are unusually smooth .",
    "the evolution of the light curve in 1997 , when a radio jet was produced , is discussed in paper i. in 1998 july and august , we see full , large - amplitude ( @xmath10 mag ) cv - like flickering when ch cygni is in a high state .",

    "the power spectra were generally well - fit with power - law plus a constant ( for the high - frequency white noise ) models , @xmath11 , with power - law index @xmath12 .",
    "in the 2000 low state , the power - law was slightly flatter , with @xmath13 on 2000 june 22 , and @xmath14 on 2000 july 3 .",
    "table 2 lists two measures of the overall variability amplitude for each observation ( except observation # 10 , on 1999 july 14 , for which the weather was poor ) .",
    "the fractional root - mean - square ( rms ) variation ( in mmag ) is in column 2 .",
    "column 3 lists the fractional variation multiplied by the approximate @xmath0-band luminosity of ch cygni at the relevant epoch ( taking a bandwidth of 1000  ) to provide an estimate of the optical luminosity of the variable component , @xmath15 .",
    "there has been much debate over whether ch cygni is a double or a triple stellar system ( e.g. , in favor of triple : hinkle 1993 ; skopal 1995 ; skopal et al .",
    "1996 ; iijima 1998 ; in favor of double : e.g. , mikoajewska 1994 ; munari et al .",
    "1996 ; ezuka , ishida , & makino 1998 ) .",
    "the most controversial contention is that the 756-d radial velocity variations are orbital , in addition to those from the more generally accepted 14-yr orbital period .",
    "our conclusions in this paper do not depend upon whether ch cygni is a double or triple system .",
    "the light curves from our 1999 observations show very little rapid variability . in 1999",
    "june , we see low amplitude flickering ( @xmath16 mmag ) .",
    "the 1999 july light curves are constant at our sensitivity limit of a few mmag .",
    "our measurement of a very tight flickering upper limit in 1999 july is consistent with both the interpretation by @xcite of this event as an eclipse by a companion orbiting with a period of roughly 14 years ( and their timing of the eclipse as beginning in early june ) , and our assumption that the flickering is due to accretion on to the wd .",
    "their evidence for the eclipse includes a deep @xmath2-band minimum , disappearance of the broad bases of the balmer emission lines , and the close coincidence of this behavior with spectroscopic conjunction .",
    "the eclipse began in early 1999 june , and the minimum of the eclipse occurred at jd @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we detected some variations in 1999 june , when the optical light curve had not quite reached eclipse minimum ; the beginning of totality must have fallen between mid - june and mid - july . according to @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath2-band flux dropped in about 10 days , beginning in early 1999 june .",
    "some portion of the disk may therefore still have been visible on 1999 june 12 and 13 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipsespec ] , a comparison of spectra from before and during the proposed eclipse confirms that the hot component disappeared . during the eclipse , the blue veiling continuum vanished , and the red - giant absorption features dominated the spectrum . the hei @xmath185015 emission line from the region close to the wd also disappeared , while the lower - excitation h@xmath19 , h@xmath20 , and [ oiii ] @xmath185007 emission lines weakened .",
    "the lowest excitation [ oi ] @xmath186300 emission line , which probably comes from the outer - most , low density region of the nebula , remained unchanged .",
    "the overall line changes are consistent with an eclipse of the accreting wd and inner nebula by the red giant .",
    "coherent oscillations in optical or x - ray emission are one of the most decisive signatures of magnetic accretion in cvs and x - ray pulsars . magnetically channeled accretion produces hot spots on the surface of the compact star that rotate in and out of the line of sight at the wd or neutron - star spin period . in cvs , x - rays from the rotating accretion column can act like a lighthouse beam illuminating the disk and/or stellar surface .",
    "the optical pulsation amplitudes due to magnetic accretion in intermediate polars generally range from a few percent to 10 - 20 % ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "the optical oscillation amplitude for the well - known magnetic propeller ae aqr is slightly smaller : 0.2 - 0.3% when it is quiet , and about 1% during flares @xcite .",
    "its x - ray emission , however , is modulated with an amplitude of 25% @xcite .",
    "there is currently only one symbiotic binary with convincing evidence for a strongly magnetized wd .",
    "sokoloski & bildsten ( 1999 ) discovered the first symbiotic magnetic accretor in the prototypical symbiotic z andromedae .",
    "they repeatedly detected a statistically significant oscillation at @xmath21 s , which they interpreted as the spin period of the accreting white dwarf .",
    "thus , coherent brightness oscillations are also a signature of magnetic accretion in symbiotic stars .",

    "they suggested that the inner disk is ejected and a jet produced when the accretion rate onto the wd drops and the system changes from the accretor to the propeller state . in their model , the optical flickering is due to the interaction of the accreted material with a strong magnetic field .",
    "later , @xcite reported the detection of an oscillation with a period of 500 s , which they claimed was the rotation period of the white dwarf .",
    "if confirmed , this oscillation would provide some support for the magnetic propeller model for ch cygni ( which is discussed further by e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray , radio , and optical observations by other authors , however , do not support the magnetic interpretation of ch cygni .",
    "@xcite observed stochastic x - ray variations on time scales as short as 100 s , but did not detect any coherent oscillations .",
    "also , their fit to the x - ray spectrum yielded @xmath22 kev , which they claim is low compared to the @xmath23 kev typically found for magnetized cvs @xcite . by assuming equipartition of energy in the 1986 radio jet ,",
    "@xcite estimated a magnetic field strength in the jet that is consistent with a wd surface field strength of only 10 g. in addition , @xcite and @xcite found no evidence of a period between 500 and 600 s in their optical photometry for ch cygni ( although they did    claim to find periods at approximately 2200 and 3000 s ) .    to search for oscillations that would indicate magnetic accretion in ch cygni , we computed power spectra for each of the light curves in our data set .",
    "we searched for statistically significant excess power above the broad - band red - noise power , and found no coherent or quasiperiodic oscillations ( see appendix  [ app : timing ] for a discussion of oscillation detection statistics when a source also produces stochastic variations ) . even in 1998 , when ch cygni was in a high state - presumably due to accretion onto the wd - and an oscillation",
    "would have been most likely to be present in the magnetic model , we did not find any oscillations .    by performing monte carlo simulations , we placed upper limits on the amplitude of any sinusoidal variations in the data . to make this test , we added oscillatory signals to our real data and measured the amplitude needed to produce a detectable signal . because we searched for oscillations against a background of broad - band ( `` red '' ) power , which is greater at lower frequencies ,",
    "the upper limits are also a function of frequency .",
    "for example , in our 19 july 1998 observation , we could detect an oscillation with a semi - amplitude of 2% or larger if its period was between 60 and 300 s. if the period was between 2500 and 3500 s , we could only constrain the semi - amplitude of any oscillation hidden in the flickering to be less than 17% .",
    "table  3 lists the results of searching the period range of 450 to 550 s for all the light curves where the power spectrum could be well characterized by a power - law model .",
    "we list oscillation amplitudes that were detectable at a 95% confidence level in 95% of the realizations .",
    "they range from 0.2% in the low states in 1997 and 2000 to 3.2% in the 1998 high state . to reduce the variance of the noise powers at high frequencies , and",
    "therefore improve our sensitivity to a possible quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) near 500 s , we divided each light curve into 2 - 10 segments , and averaged the power spectra from these individual segments . applying this procedure ,",
    "we did not find statistically significant qpos above the background `` red '' power spectrum for any of the observations of ch cygni listed in table  3 .",
    "the non - detection of coherent oscillations at any frequency tested in either the high or low state , our limits on coherent oscillations near 500 s , and the lack of evidence for any qpos near this period make the magnetic interpretation for ch cyg questionable . as for the theoretical necessity of a strong magnetic field for jet production , @xcite found , for x - ray binaries , that the truncation of the inner disk by a strong magnetic field could actually inhibit the formation of a jet , not cause it .",
    "therefore , we conclude that alternatives to the magnetic propeller model for ch cygni should be explored .",
    "in almost every type of interacting binary star ( or other accreting system ) , disk accretion produces stochastic brightness variations .",
    "the flickering in ch cygni disappeared during eclipse of the hot component ( see  [ sec : eclipse ] ) , and must therefore come from a region physically near the wd .",
    "inhomogeneities in and around an accretion column in polars can produce stochastic variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and @xcite have suggested that brightness fluctuations in ch cygni are due to interaction of the accreted material with a strong magnetic field . but no spin modulation has been found in ch cygni ( see  [ sec : mag ] ) , so the flickering in this system is unlikely to be related to magnetism .",
    "@xcite noted that the x - ray emission detected by exosat could be due to either a disk boundary layer or shock - heated colliding winds .",
    "fast stochastic variations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* later confirmed variations with time scales as short as 100 s ) support a disk boundary layer .",
    "theoretically , a disk can form from the red - giant wind in ch cygni if the wind speed is @xmath24 km s@xmath5 ( for @xmath25 d ) or @xmath26 km s@xmath5 ( for @xmath27 yr ; taking a total system mass of @xmath28 in each case ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite measure a stellar - disk size for the red giant in ch cygni of 10.4 mas . for a distance of 245 @xmath29 pc ( from the mode of the hipparcos parallax probability distribution )",
    ", this angular size corresponds to a stellar radius of approximately 270 @xmath30 , which is reasonable for an m6 - 7iii giant .",
    "@xcite also estimate a radius of @xmath31 , from the @xmath32 and @xmath33 magnitudes .",
    "the escape speed is therefore about 40 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the red - giant wind speed is probably less than the escape speed , and so it is reasonable to expect a disk to form .",
    "thus , the most natural explanation for the fast fluctuations is disk flickering , and changes in the flickering can tell us about changes in the disk .",
    "looking back at table  2 , we see that the optical luminosity of the rapidly variable component , @xmath15 , increased by more than a factor of 20 between 1997 and the optical high state in 1998 .",
    "given this large increase , the physical process that produces the optical flickering must have been largely responsible for the overall optical brightening of ch cygni ( by roughly a factor of 7 ) between 1997 and 1998 .",
    "the large increase in the luminosity of the flickering component therefore implies that the change to a high state was due to an increase in the accretion rate through the disk , @xmath34 .",
    "one way to produce a change in @xmath34 through a disk is via a dwarf - nova - like thermal - viscous disk instablity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the disk in ch cygni could be much larger than disks in cvs , the time - averaged accretion rate could be higher , and it is formed from a wind rather than a stream .",
    "duschl ( 1986a , b ) examined large symbiotic accretion disks theoretically , and found that they are also likely to experience limit - cycle instabilities .",
    "the @xmath34-@xmath35 relations ( where @xmath35 is the surface density ) have negative - sloping sections in the temperature region where h is ionized , as in cvs , and also at lower temperatures , where the molecular opacity changes . again taking a distance of 245 @xmath29 parsec for ch cygni , @xmath36 in the 1979 - 1984 high state , @xmath37 in the low state after the 1985 jet , and @xmath38 at the extremely low point after the jet in 1997 .",
    "these values are reasonable for dwarf - nova high and low states given that the disk in ch cygni is likely to be large and that the red giant makes a significant contribution at @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath15 is of the order of the luminosity expected from accretion onto a wd ( @xmath40 erg s@xmath5 ) , with a lower accretion rate onto the wd in 1997 compared to 1998 .",
    "furthermore , the expected recurrence time for an instability in a large disk , assuming an average accretion rate of @xmath41 and an accretion disk radius on the order of tens of solar radii , is on the order of years .",
    "this expected recurrence time agrees well with the time scale of state changes in ch cygni .",
    "finally , in the high state , the hot component in ch cygni has an f - type supergiant spectrum , very similar to the high - state disks of dwarf novae in outburst .",
    "there are , however , some major differences between the behavior of ch cygni and that of dwarf novae in the optical . instead of having the fast rise and exponential decay shape common to dwarf - nova outbursts ,",
    "the high states in ch cyg tend to be plateau - like .",
    "ch cygni s long - term light curve is also much more complex than long periods of quiescence with outbursts superimposed .",
    "@xcite explored an alternative hypothesis - that the long - term optical variations in ch cygni ( time scale of months to decades ) are due to obscuration by dust .",
    "several observations after the 1984 and 1996 optical flux declines revealed an increase in the column density of dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 1996 optical fading to the very - low state , however , occurred 100 to 150 days before the increased production of dust ( as indicated by a sudden change in @xmath42 color ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the 1984 optical fading to the low state also occurred before the dust condensation in 1985 - 1987 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spectral changes described in paper i are consistent with a decrease in the ionization state of the nebula , not obscuration of the entire system .",
    "therefore , the optical fadings ( and associated jet events ) were either unrelated to the episodes of dust condensation , or even somehow caused the dust production .",
    "the increase in the optical flickering luminosity in the high state indicates that the activity in this system is accretion - driven . since the disk in ch cyg ( assuming one exists ) is expected to be subject to the same instability as in dwarf novae ( and possibly another ; *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we propose that such instabilities drive the activity in ch cygni as well . since jets are sometimes associated with state changes in ch cygni , collimated outflows could be related to the disk instabilities .",
    "an alternative model , in which material is expelled by a rapidly rotating magnetic field , requires that the wd have a strong magnetic field .",
    "we do not find evidence for such a field , and therefore favor the disk - instability scenario .",
    "this work has been supported in part by nsf grant int-9902665 . in this research , we have used and acknowledge with thanks , data from the aavso international database , based on observations submitted to the aavso by variable star observers worldwide .",
    "we also thank r. p. s. stone for performing the photometric observations in 2000 , and c. brocksopp , m. muno , and l. bildsten for helpful comments .",
    "the presence of large - amplitude stochastic variations makes coherent oscillations , which are the hallmark of magnetic accretion , difficult to identify . in order to make any statistical statements about coherent oscillations , qpos , or the quality of a model fit to the power spectrum",
    ", one must assume some distribution of the noise powers about the `` true '' power spectrum shape .",
    "van der klis ( 1989 ) found that for the neutron - star binary gx 5 - 1 , which flickers and has a qpo in the x - ray regime , the distribution of noise powers at a given frequency is well described by a @xmath43 distribution about the mean value of the power at that frequency ( averaged over thousands of observations ) .",
    "@xcite predicted a @xmath43 noise - power distribution on theoretical grounds for a `` red '' spectrum that is the integral of white noise .",
    "since we do not have thousands of observations , we take the suggestion of @xcite and assume a @xmath43 distribution about the best fit power law for each observation . the probability @xmath44 that the noise power in a single frequency bin will exceed the threshold value @xmath45 is @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where the @xmath43 distribution with @xmath49 degrees of freedom is given by @xmath50^{-1 } \\int_{\\chi^2}^{\\infty } t^{(\\nu/2 ) - 1}\\ , e^{-t/2}\\ , dt,\\ ] ] and @xmath51 is the value of the model fit at the frequency of interest . performing the integral ,",
    "we get the well - known result @xmath52 . for a search of multiple frequency bins , the probability @xmath44 that at least one of the noise powers will exceed @xmath45 is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of frequencies searched . a peak with power @xmath45 in the power spectrum only indicates the presence of a coherent oscillation if this probability is small .",
    "the original , full frequency - resolution power spectra provide the best sensitivity to a narrow ( single frequency bin ) feature in the power spectrum .",
    "sensitivity to a broad feature ( qpo ) , on the other hand , improves when power spectra produced from light curve segments are averaged , as long as the width of the feature is larger than one frequency bin in the averaged power spectrum ( van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "using the notation of @xcite , averaging @xmath55 power spectra reduces the variance in the combined power spectrum by a factor of @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is an additional factor for binning in the frequency domain .",
    "the noise powers in the averaged and binned power spectrum are distributed like @xmath43 with @xmath58 instead of 2 degrees of freedom , and @xmath59 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 3.4 ) .",

    "<S> ch cygni began producing rapid , stochastic optical variations with the onset of symbiotic activity in 1963 . </S>",
    "<S> we use changes in this flickering between 1997 and 2000 to diagnose the state of the accretion disk during this time . in the 1998 high state , </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity of the @xmath0-band flickering component was typically more than 20 times higher than in the 1997 and 2000 low states . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the physical process or region that produces the flickering was also primarily responsible for the large optical flux increase in the 1998 high state . assuming that the rapid , stochastic optical variations in ch cygni come from the accretion disk , as in cataclysmic variable stars , a change in the accretion rate through the disk led to the 1998 bright state . </S>",
    "<S> all flickering disappeared in 1999 , when the accreting wd was eclipsed by the red giant orbiting with a period of approximately 14 yr , according to the ephemeris of hinkle et al . and </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation of eyres et al . </S>",
    "<S> we did not find any evidence for periodic or quasi - periodic oscillations in the optical emission from ch cygni in either the high or low state , and we discuss the implications for magnetic propeller models of this system . as one alternative to propeller models , we propose that the activity in ch cygni is driven by accretion through a disk with a thermal - viscous instability , similar to the instabilities believed to exist in dwarf novae and suggested for fu ori pre - main - sequence stars and soft x - ray transients . </S>"
