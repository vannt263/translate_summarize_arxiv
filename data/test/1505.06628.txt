    "the theory of support varieties for finitely generated modules over the group algebra of a finite group began back in the nineteen eighties with the work of alperin and evens  @xcite , avrunin and scott  @xcite , carlson @xcite , among others .",
    "an essential ingredient in its development was carlson s anticipation that for elementary abelian @xmath1-groups the cohomological definition of support , which takes its roots in quillen s fundamental work on mod @xmath1 group cohomology @xcite , gave the same answer as the `` rank '' definition through restriction to cyclic shifted subgroups .    to deal with infinitely generated modules , benson , carlson and",
    "rickard @xcite found that they had to introduce cyclic shifted subgroups for generic points of subvarieties , defined over transcendental extensions of the field of coefficients .",
    "correspondingly , all the homogeneous prime ideals in the cohomology ring are involved , not just the maximal ones . this enabled them to classify the tensor ideal thick subcategories of the stable category @xmath2 of finitely generated @xmath3-modules @xcite .",
    "it seemed plausible that one should be able to use modifications of the same techniques to classify the tensor ideal localising subcategories of the stable category @xmath4 of all @xmath3-modules , but there were formidable technical obstructions to realising this , and it was not until more than a decade later that this was achieved by the first three authors of this paper @xcite , using a rather different set of ideas than the ones in @xcite .",
    "the basic strategy was a series of reductions , via changes of categories , that reduced the problem to that of classifying the localising subcategories of the derived category of differential graded modules over a polynomial ring , where it was solved using methods from commutative algebra .",
    "a series of papers @xcite , established machinery required to execute this strategy .    in this paper",
    "we give an entirely new , and conceptually different , proof of the classification of the tensor ideal localising subcategories of @xmath4 from @xcite .",
    "it is closer in spirit to the proof of the classification of the tensor ideal thick subcategories of @xmath2 from @xcite , and rooted essentially in linear algebra .",
    "the crucial new idea is to introduce and study @xmath0-cosupports for representations .",
    "the inspiration for this comes from two sources .",
    "the first is the theory of @xmath0-points developed by friedlander and the fourth author @xcite as a suitable generalisation of cyclic shifted subgroups . whereas carlson s original construction only applied to elementary abelian @xmath1-groups , and required an explicit choice of generators of the group algebra , @xmath0-points allow for a `` rank variety '' description of the cohomological support for any finite group scheme ; see ( * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath0-support of a module over a finite group scheme @xmath5 defined over a field @xmath6 is introduced and used to classify the tensor ideal thick subcategories of @xmath2 ( with an error corrected in a sequel  @xcite to this paper ) .",
    "but the tensor ideal localising subcategories of @xmath4 remained inaccessible by these techniques alone , even for finite groups .",
    "what is required is a @xmath0-version of the notion of cosupports introduced in @xcite .",
    "the relevance of @xmath0-cosupport is through the following formula for the module of homomorphisms , proved in section  [ se : support - and - cosupport ] . for any finite group scheme @xmath5 over @xmath6 , and @xmath3-modules @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    ", there is an equality @xmath9 to be able to apply this formula to cohomological cosupport developed in [ 9 ] one needs to identify the two notions of cosupport .",
    "our strategy for making this identification is to prove that @xmath0-cosupport detects projectivity : a @xmath3-module is projective if and only if its @xmath0-cosupport is empty .",
    "the desired classification result would then follow from general techniques developed in  @xcite .    in section  [ se : finite - groups ]",
    "we prove such a detection theorem for projectivity for _ finite groups_. besides yielding the desired classification theorem for @xmath4 from @xcite , it implies that cohomological support and cosupport coincide with @xmath0-support and @xmath0-cosupport , respectively .",
    "this remarkable fact is a vast generalisation of carlson s original anticipation .",
    "the different origins of the two notions are reflected in the fact that phenomena that are transparent , or at least easy to detect , for one may be rather opaque and difficult to verify for the other .",
    "see section  [ se : applications ] for illustrations .",
    "the corresponding detection theorem for arbitrary finite group schemes has turned out to be more challenging , and is dealt with in the sequel to this paper @xcite , using a different approach , where again @xmath0-support and @xmath0-cosupport play a crucial role .",
    "this brings us to the second purpose of this paper : to lay the groundwork for the proof in @xcite . for this reason parts of this paper",
    "are written in the language of finite group schemes .",
