    "the behavior of small particles immersed in a shear flow has been of interest for a long time . on the one hand the particles influence the flow properties and on the other hand the flow controls the motion of the particles . in biological systems with flows through narrow channels , one frequently encounters a sheared flow - field carrying polymeric particles . in recent experiments @xcite",
    "one has focused the distribution of the particles as a function of their orientation . particularly interesting",
    "are the experiments of harasim et al .",
    "@xcite where the motion of fragments of f - actin in a shear flow has been recorded such that the tumbling of the fragments can be seen _",
    "ad oculos_. the motion of the particles is quasi - periodic , with a stochastically distributed period .",
    "this makes the explanation also theoretically of much interest , as it is a combined effect of systematic as well as thermal forces of the flow on the particles .",
    "several theoretical papers @xcite haved been devoted to the analysis of the motion using various approximations , but it turns out to be difficult to theoretically extract the periodicity .",
    "for a recent survey of the motion of solid objects in a flow see @xcite .    in this recent literature",
    "no mention is made of a fundamental contribution of j.m .",
    "burgers @xcite , who considered the simplest version of the problem : that of a rigid object in a shear flow . burgers derived the equation for the probabilty distribution for the steady state and analyzed the solution for the first few orders in an expansion in powers of the weissenberg number , which is a dimensionless measure of the strength of the shear force . in this paper",
    "we revisit the problem that burgers discussed and extend the solution to arbitrary values of the weissenberg number @xmath0 by numerical exact methods .",
    "in particular we are interested in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "this allows us to derive the flow pattern in orientation space , to extract the periodicity and to give the average tumbling time .    in this note",
    "we consider , for simplicity , a rigid rod consisting of a number of stiffly aligned monomers .",
    "polymers may well be approximated by this model if their length is shorter than the persistence length .",
    "one can form a simple hamiltonian model of interacting beads @xcite and tune the parameters of the model such that they accurately reproduce the force - extension curve of a class of polymers @xcite . indeed , as the experiments of @xcite show , a polymer like f - actin tumbles almost without bending when the length is shorter than the persistence length @xcite .",
    "the influence of the fluid on the rod is given by the langevin equation in the high viscosity limit , leaving out acceleration effects .",
    "we start by deriving the langevin equation for a rod of rigidly aligned monomers and transform it into the equivalent fokker - planck equation , which was burgers line of approach .",
    "then we discuss the expansion of the solution in powers of @xmath0 and indicate that the convergence radius of the series is of the order @xmath1 . as a preparation for and illustration of the spherical geometry",
    "we show how the problem confined to a circular geometry admits an exact analytical solution , which demonstrates scaling behavior in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "we expand the spherical solution for arbitrary weissenberg numbers @xmath0 in terms of adapted basis functions and solve the partial differential equation by an optimization process . using this optimization",
    "we obtain an accurate solution for weissenberg numbers up to @xmath2 . with the solution",
    "we determine the flow pattern in the orientation space , yielding the average period of the tumbling and the average tumbling frequency .",
    "finally we analyze the scaling solution for the large-@xmath0 limit and give the properties of the tumbling process in this limit . the scaling limit matches",
    "perfectly with the results for @xmath3 and an simple interpolation formula is given , covering the whole range of weissenberg numbers .",
    "in the high viscosity limit the langevin equation the equation of motion for the monomers , kicked around by random forces and slowed down by friction , reads @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the hamiltonian of the monomers and @xmath6 is the friction coefficient .",

    "@xmath9 is the shear rate .",
    "@xmath10 is the @xmath11 coordinate of the center - of - mass of the chain and @xmath12 is the @xmath11 coordinate of monomer @xmath13 . from now on we subtract the center - of mass motion , by taking the positions @xmath14 with respect to the center - of - mass . in total",

    "the shear force gives the fluid torque @xmath20 and the last term gives the total random torque @xmath21    let the orientation of the rod be represented by the unit vector @xmath22 . then the angular momentum can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the moment of inertia ( divided by the mass of the monomers ) , equaling @xmath25 with @xmath26 is the distance between the monomers . since all positions @xmath14 point in the direction @xmath22 ,",
    "the shear torque is likewise @xmath27 the correlation function between the components of the random torque follows from that between the random forces , given by ( [ a2 ] ) , as @xmath28 we have used here that the correlation tensor between the components is isotropic .",
    "so we may take components in the direction of @xmath22 and two orthogonal ones in the plane perpendicular to @xmath22 .",
    "then the non - vanishing correlations are multiplied by @xmath29 and the summation over @xmath13 again results in the moment of inertia @xmath24 .",
    "we get an equation of motion for @xmath22 by dividing the summed equations ( [ a1 ] ) by @xmath24 @xmath30 clearly only components in the plane perpendicular to @xmath22 matter .",
    "we make this equation dimensionless by expressing time in terms of the rotational diffusion time @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the rotational diffusion coefficient @xmath33 thus we introduce the dimensionless ( reduced ) time variable @xmath34 @xmath35 and write ( [ a10 ] ) as @xmath36 with the weissenberg number @xmath0 as dimensionless measure for the shear rate @xmath37 and @xmath38 the reduced random torque @xmath39 which gives the spectrum of correlation @xmath40 the correlations now have a magnitude 1 .",
