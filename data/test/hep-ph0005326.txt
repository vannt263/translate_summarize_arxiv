    "one of the most interesting subjects in high energy heavy - ion collisions is study of the higher order bose - einstein correlation ( bec ) effect @xcite ( known also as the hbt or the gglp effect , or as the hadron interferometry @xcite ) . from data on bec we can ( in principle )",
    "infer the size of the interaction region and therefore estimate the energy densities reached in high energy collisions .",
    "such work is a necessary task in the search for the quark - gluon plasma @xcite - a new , hypothetical form of matter .    to get more precise sizes of the interaction regions",
    ", we have to take into account the final state interactions among the charged particles @xcite .",
    "a great advance in this direction for the bec of the three - charged particles has been recently made by alt et .",
    "they have derived a correction formula for the raw data introducing distribution functions of the charged particles .",
    "their formulation is based on the plane wave functions and on the coulomb wave functions , assuming that produced hadrons are already in the asymptotic region of the coulomb interactions where the strong interaction already vanishes @xcite .",
    "it amounts in the following correction factor @xmath1 due to the coulomb effect for identical three - charged particles : ] where @xmath2 is the momentum of particle @xmath3 , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are two and three particles probability densities , respectively .",

    "@xmath9 the denominator @xmath10 is given by ( @xmath8 are distribution functions of charged particles ) : @xmath11 the numerator @xmath12 has the following form : @xmath13 here @xmath14 are the coulomb wave functions of the respective 2-body collision expressed as , @xmath15 ,    \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) , one has to assume first some shapes and sizes for the source functions .",
    "in fact , this is the procedure already used in ref .",
    "@xcite by na44 collaboration : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the effect of multiparticle production in the single particle spectra and the acceptance effect in the experiment .    in this paper",

    "@xcite , the bec of identical two - charged pions can also be analysed by the coulomb wave functions .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that the numerator @xmath12 is the main theoretical ingredient in analysis of the bec of three - charged particles .",

    "the minimum @xmath36 value , 17.6 in table [ table1 ] , seems to be big , as the number of the data points are considered .",
    "thus we would like to know why this equation can not explain the data @xcite .",
    "we know that there are several possible reasons due to effects of the partial coherence , the contamination @xcite and the long - lived resonances @xcite . at present",

    "@xcite ) : @xmath37 it contains one more parameter , @xmath38 , which can be regarded as a kind of effective degree of coherence and which , in our opinion , should therefore occur also somehow in eq .",
