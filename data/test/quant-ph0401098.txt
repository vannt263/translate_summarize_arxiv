    "since einstein formulated special relativity in 1905 , the basic space - time symmetry has been that of the lorentz group .",
    "he established the energy - momentum relation which is valid for slow massive particles , high - speed massive particles , and massless particles .",
    "einstein formulated this relation initially for particles without internal space - time structures , but it is widely accepted that it is valid for all particles including particles with spin and/or internal space - time extension .    in 1939 , wigner published his most fundamental paper dealing with internal space - time symmetries of relativistic particles  @xcite . in this paper , wigner introduced the lorentz group to physics .",
    "furthermore , by introducing his `` little groups , '' wigner provided the framework for studying the internal space - time symmetries of relativistic particles .",
    "the scientific contents of this paper have not yet been fully recognized by the physics community .",
    "we are writing this report as a continuation of the work wigner initiated in this history - making paper .    while particle physicists are still struggling to understand internal space - time symmetries of elementary particles , wigner s lorentz group is becoming useful to many other branches of physics . among them",
    "are optical sciences , both quantum and classical . in quantum optics ,",
    "the coherent and squeezed states are representations of the lorentz group  @xcite .",
    "recently , the lorentz group is becoming the fundamental language for classical ray optics .",
    "it is gratifying to note that optical components , such as lenses , polarizers , interferometers , lasers , and multi - layers can all be formulated in terms of the lorentz group which wigner formulated in his 1939 paper .",
    "classical ray optics is of course a very old subject , but we can not do new physics without measurements using optical instruments . indeed , classical ray optics constitutes wigner s frontier in physics",
    ".    the word `` group theory '' sounds like abstract mathematics , but it is gratifying to note that wigner s little groups can be formulated in terms of two - by - two matrices , while classical ray optics is largely a physics of two - by - two matrices .",
    "the mathematical correspondence is straight - forward .    in order to see this point clearly ,",
    "let us start with the following classic example .",
    "the second - order differential equation @xmath0 is applicable to a driven harmonic oscillator with dissipation .",
    "this can also be used for studying an electronic circuits consisting of inductance , resistance , capacitance , and an alternator .",
    "thus , it is possible to study the oscillator system using an electronic circuit .",
    "likewise , an algebra of two - by - two matrices can serve as the scientific language for several different branches of physics , including special relativity , ray optics , and quantum optics .    rccc + & & & + & massive , slow & covariance & massless , fast + & & & + energy- & & einstein s & + momentum & @xmath1 & @xmath2 & @xmath3 + & & & + internal & @xmath4 & & @xmath5 + space - time & & wigner s & + [ -1 mm ] symmetry & @xmath6 & little group & gauge trans .",
    "+ & & & + relativistic & & lorentz - squeezed & + extended & quarks & harmonic & partons + [ -1 mm ] particles & & oscillators & +    there are many physical systems which can be formulated in terms of two - by - two matrices . if we restrict that their determinant be one , there is a well established mathematical discipline called the group theory of @xmath7 .",
    "this aspect was noted in the study of lorentz transformations . in group",
    "theoretical terminology , the group @xmath7 is the universal covering group of the group of the lorentz group . in practical terms , to each two - by - two matrix , there corresponds one four - by - four matrix which performs a lorentz transformation in the four - dimensional minkowskian space .",
    "thus , if a physical system can be explained in terms of two - by - two matrices , it can be explained with the language of lorentz transformations .",
    "furthermore , the physical system based on two - by - two matrices can serve as an analogue computer for lorentz transformations",
    ".    optical filters , polarizers , and interferometers deal with two independent optical rays .",
    "they superpose the beams , change the relative phase shift , and change relative amplitudes . the basic language here is called the jones matrix formalism , consisting of the two - by - two matrix representation of the @xmath7 group  @xcite .",
    "the four - by - four mueller matrices are derivable from the two - by - two matrices of @xmath7 .",
    "for these two - beam systems , the poincar sphere serves as an effective language  @xcite .",
    "since the two - beam system is described by the lorentz group , the poincar sphere is necessarily a representation of the lorentz group .",
    "we shall use this sphere to study the degree of coherence between the beams .",
    "para - axial lens optics can also be formulated in terms of two - by - two matrices , applicable to the two - component vector space consisting of the distance from the optical axis and the slope with respect to the axis .",
    "the lens and translation matrices are triangular , but they are basically representations of the @xmath8 group which is the real subgroup of the group @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "laser optics is basically multi - lens lens optics .",
    "however , the problem here is how to get a simple mathematical expression for the system of a large number of the same lens separateled by equal distance . here again , group theory simplifies calculations  @xcite .    in multi - layer optics",
    ", we deal with two optical rays moving in opposite directions .",
    "the standard language in this case is the s - matrix formalism  @xcite .",
    "this is also a two - by - two matrix formalism . as in the case of laser cavities , the problem is the multiplication of a large number of matrix chains  @xcite .",
    "it is shown in this report that the two - by - two representation of the six - parameter lorentz group is the underlying common scientific language for all of the instruments mentioned above .",
    "while the abstract group theoretical ideas make two - by - two matrix calculations more systematic and transparent in optics , optical instruments can act as analogue computers for lorentz transformations in special relativity .",
    "it is gratifying to note that special relativity and ray optics can be formulated as the physics of two - by - two matrices .    in sec .",
    "[ lorentz ] , we explain how the lorentz group can be formulated in terms of four - by - four matrices .",
    "it is shown that the group can have six independent parameters . in sec .",
    "[ spinor ] , we explain how it is possible to formulate the lorentz group in terms of two - by - two matrices . it is shown that the four - by - four transformation matrices can be constructed from those those of the two - by - two matrices .    in sec .",
    "[ wlittle ] , we discuss the historical significance of wigner s 1939 paper  @xcite on the lorentz group and its application to the internal space - time symmetries of relativistic particles . in sec .",
    "[ polari ] , we present the basic building blocks for the two - by - two representation of the lorentz group in terms of the matrices commonly seen in ray optics .    in secs .",
    "[ polari ] and [ interfer ] , we study the polarizations for the two - beam system .",

    "the role of the stokes parameters is discussed in detail .",
    "it is shown in sec .",
    "[ poinc ] that the poincar sphere is a graphical representation of the poincar group , and serves as a device to describe the degree of coherence .    in secs .",
    "[ olens ] , [ mlens ] , [ lcav ] , and [ mlayer ] , we discuss one - lens system , multi - lens system , laser cavities , and multi - layer optics , respectively . in all of these sections ,",
    "the central scientific language is the lorentz group .    in appendix",
    "[ sqosc ] , we expand the content of the third row of table  [ einwig ] . it is noted that the covariant harmonic oscillator formalism can unify the quark model for slow hadrons with the parton model for ultra - relativistic quarks .",
    "it is then shown that the same oscillator formalism serves as the basic scientific language for squeezed states of light .    in appendix",
    "[ euler ] , it is shown that the lie - group method , in terms of the generators , is not the only method in constructing group representations .",
    "for the rotation group and the three - parameter subgroups of the lorentz group , it is simpler to start with the minimum number of starter matrices .",
    "for instance , while there are three generators for the rotation group in the lie approach , we can construct the most general form of the rotation matrix from rotations around two directions , as goldstein constructed the euler angles  @xcite .    in appendix  [ conju ] , it is noted that the four - by - four matrices are real , their two - by - two counterparts are complex .",
    "however , there is a three - parameter real subgroup called @xmath8 .",
    "it is shown that the complex subgroup @xmath9 is equivalent to @xmath8 through conjugate transformation .",
    "let us consider the space - time coordinates @xmath10 . then the rotation around the @xmath11 axis is performed by the four - by - four matrix @xmath12 this transformation is generated by @xmath13 likewise ,",
    "we can write down the generators of rotations @xmath14 and @xmath15 around the @xmath16 and @xmath17 axes respectively . @xmath18 these three generators satisfy the closed set of commutations relations @xmath19 = i \\epsilon_{ijk } j_{k } .\\ ] ] this set of commutation relations is for the three - dimensional rotation group .",
    "the lorentz boost along the @xmath11 axis takes the form @xmath20 which is generated by @xmath21 likewise , we can write generators of boosts @xmath22 and @xmath23 along the @xmath16 and @xmath17 axes respectively , and they take the form @xmath24 these boost generators satisfy the commutation relations @xmath25 = i \\epsilon_{ijk } k_{k } , \\qquad \\left[k_{i } , k_{j } \\right ] = -i \\epsilon_{ijk } j_{k } .\\ ] ]    indeed , the three rotation generators and the three boost generators satisfy the closed set of commutation relations given in eq.([rotcom ] ) and eq.([locom ] ) . these three commutation relations form the starting point of the lorentz group .",
    "the generators given in this section are four - by - four matrices , but they are not the only set satisfying the commutation relations",
    ". we can construct also six two - by - two matrices satisfying the same set of commutation relations .",
    "the group of transformations constructed from these two - by - two matrices is often called @xmath26 or the two - dimensional representation of the lorentz group . throughout the present paper ,",
    "we used the two - by - two transformation matrices constructed from the generators of the @xmath26 group .",
    "in sec .  [ lorentz ] , we started with four - by - four transformation matrices applicable to the four - dimensional space - time .",
    "we then ended up with a set of closed commutation relations for the six generators consisting of three rotation and three boost generators .",
    "these generators are in the form of four - by - four matrices .    in this section",
    ", we shall see first that there is a set of two - by - two matrices satisfying the same set of commutation relations , constituting the two - by - two representations of the lorentz group .",
    "the representation so constructed is called the @xmath26 group , or the universal covering group of the lorentz group .",
    "the transformation matrices are applicable to two - component @xmath7 spinors .",
    "the algebraic property of this two - by - two representation is the same as that of the four - by - four representation .",
    "as we shall see in this paper , the spinors and the four - vectors correspond to jones vectors and stokes parameters respectively in polarization optics  @xcite .",
    "the question then is whether we can construct the four - vector from the spinors . in the language of polarization optics ,",
    "the question is whether it is possible to construct the coherency matrix  @xcite from the jones vector .    with this point in mind",
    ", let us start from the following form of the pauli spin matrices : @xmath27 these matrices are written in a different convention . here",
    "@xmath28 is imaginary , while @xmath29 is imaginary in the traditional notation .",
    "also in this convention , we can construct three rotation generators @xmath30 which satisfy the closed set of commutation relations @xmath31 = i \\epsilon_{ijk } j_{k } .\\ ] ] we can also construct three boost generators @xmath32 which satisfy the commutation relations @xmath33",
    "= -i \\epsilon_{ijk } j_{k } .\\ ] ] the @xmath34 matrices alone do not form a closed set of commutation relations , and the rotation generators @xmath35 are needed to form a closed set : @xmath36 = i \\epsilon_{ijk } k_{k } .\\ ] ]    the six matrices @xmath35 and @xmath34 form a closed set of commutation relations , and they are like the generators of the lorentz group applicable to the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional minkowski space .",
    "the group generated by the above six matrices is called @xmath26 consisting of all two - by - two complex matrices with unit determinant .",
    "let us write the two - by - two transformation matrix as @xmath37 this matrix has four complex elements with eight real parameters .",
    "however , the six generators are all traceless and , the determinant of the matrix has to be one .",
    "thus , it has six independent parameters .    in order to construct four - vectors , we need two different spinor representations of the lorentz group .",
    "let us go to the commutation relations for the generators given in eqs.([comm1 ] ) , ( [ comm2 ] ) and ( [ comm3 ] ) .",
    "these commutators are not invariant under the sign change of the rotation generators @xmath35 , but are invariant under the sign change of the squeeze operators @xmath34 .",
    "thus , to each spinor representation , there is another representation with the squeeze generators with opposite sign .",
    "this allows us to construct another representation with the generators : @xmath38 we call this representation the `` dotted '' representation . if we write the transformation matrix @xmath39 of eq.([alpha ] ) in terms of the generators as @xmath40",
    "then the transformation matrix in the dotted representation becomes @xmath41 in both of the above matrices , hermitian conjugation changes the direction of rotation .",
    "however , it does not change the direction of boosts .",
    "we can achieve this only by changing @xmath39 to @xmath42 , and we shall call this the `` dot '' conjugation .    likewise , there are two different set of spinors .",
    "let us use write @xmath43 for the spinor in the undotted and dotted representations respectively .",

    "[ alpha ] is applicable to the column vector of eq.([uv ] ) , what is the transformation matrix applicable to the row vector @xmath50 from the right - hand side ?",
    "it is the transpose of the matrix applicable to the column vector @xmath50 .",
    "we can obtain this column vector from @xmath51 by applying to it the matrix @xmath52 this matrix also has the property @xmath53 where the superscript @xmath54 means the transpose of the matrix .",
    "the transformation matrix applicable to the column vector of eq.([dotcol ] ) is @xmath42 of eq.([eldot ] ) .",
    "thus the matrix applicable to the row vector @xmath50 in eq.([dotmat ] ) is @xmath55 this is precisely the hermitian conjugate of @xmath39 .",
    "let us now write the @xmath56 matrix of eq.([dotmat ] ) as @xmath57 where the set of variables @xmath58 is transformed like a four - vector under lorentz transformations .",
    "then the lorentz transformation on @xmath56 can be performed as @xmath59 where the transformation matrix @xmath39 is that of eq.([alpha ] ) . as we have seen in this section ,",
    "the construction of four - vectors from the two - component spinors is not a trivial task , but has been discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "likewise , it is possible to construct four - by - four lorentz transformation matrices from the two - by - two matrix of eq.([alpha ] )  @xcite .    as we shall see in the present paper , the matrix of the form eq.([dotmat ] ) or eq.([matv ] ) appears in optics as the coherency matrix and the density matrix for two beam systems such as polarization optics and interferometers .",
    "in his 1939 paper , wigner introduced his little groups in order to study the internal space - time structures of relativistic particles .",
    "the little group is the maximal subgroup of the lorentz group which leaves the momentum of the particle invariant .",
    "the little groups , originally developed for studying relativistic symmetries of particles , are now becoming an important scientific language for ray optics as we shall see in this paper .",
    "let us first discuss the physical basis of wigner s little groups .",
    "if the speed of a particle is much smaller than that of light , energy - momentum relation is @xmath60 .",
    "if the speed is close to that of light , the relation is @xmath3 .",
    "these two different relations can be combined into one covariant formula @xmath61 .",
    "this aspect of einstein s @xmath62 is well known , as indicated in table  [ einwig ] .",
    "in addition , particles have internal space - time variables .",
    "massive particles have spins while massless particles have their helicities and gauge variables .",
    "our first question is whether this aspect of space - time variables can be unified into one covariant concept .",
    "the answer to this question is yes .",
    "little group does the job , also as indicated table  [ einwig ] .",
    "particles can also have space - time extensions .",
    "for instance , in the quark model , hadrons are bound states of quarks",
    ". however , the hadron appears as a collection of partons when it moves with speed close to the velocity of light .",
    "quarks and partons seem to have quite distinct properties .",
    "are they different manifestations of a single covariant entity ?",
    "this is one of the most pressing issues in high - energy particles physics . the third row of table  [ einwig ] addresses this question .",
    "the mathematical framework of this program was developed by eugene wigner in 1939  @xcite .",
    "he constructed the maximal subgroups of the lorentz group whose transformations will leave the four - momentum of a given particle invariant .",
    "these groups are known as wigner s little groups .",
    "thus , the transformations of the little groups change the internal space - time variables of the particle , while leaving its momentum invariant .    in his paper",
    "@xcite , wigner shows that , for each massive particle , there is a lorentz frame in which the particle is at rest .",
    "then the three - dimensional rotation group leaves its momentum invariant , while changing the direction of its spin .",
    "thus , the little group for this particular case is @xmath63 . in other lorentz frames ,",
    "the little group is a lorentz - boosted @xmath63 group .    for a massless particle ,",
    "wigner notes that there are no lorentz frames in which the particle is at rest .",
    "the best we can do is to align its momentum to a given axis , or the @xmath11 axis .",
    "then , its momentum is invariant under rotations around the @xmath11 axis .",
    "in addition , wigner found two more transformations which leave the momentum invariant .",
    "the physics of these additional degrees was not explained in wigner s original paper  @xcite , but their mathematics has been worked out .",
    "the physics of these degrees of freedom was later determined to be that of gauge transformations  @xcite , and its complete understanding was not achieved until 1990  @xcite .",
    "the group of lorentz transformations consists of three boosts and three rotations .",
    "the rotations therefore constitute a subgroup of the lorentz group .",
    "if a massive particle is at rest , its four - momentum is invariant under rotations .",
    "thus the little group for a massive particle at rest is the three - dimensional rotation group .",
    "then what is affected by the rotation ?",
    "the answer to this question is very simple .",
    "the particle in general has its spin .",
    "the spin orientation is going to be affected by the rotation ! if we use the four - vector coordinate @xmath10 , the four - momentum vector for the particle at rest is @xmath64 , and the three - dimensional rotation group leaves this four - momentum invariant .",
    "this little group is generated by the three rotation generators given in eq.([j33 ] ) and eq.([j12 ] ) .",
    "they satisfy the commutation relations for the rotation group given eq.([rotcom ] ) .",
    "if the rest - particle is boosted along the @xmath11 direction , it up a non - zero momentum component along the same direction .",
    "the @xmath63 generators will also be boosted .",
    "the boost matrix takes the form of eq.([boostz ] ) , and the boosted generators will be @xmath65 and this boost will not change the commutation relation of eq.([rotcom ] ) .    for a massless particle moving along the @xmath66 direction , wigner observed that the little group generated by the rotation generator around the @xmath11 axis , namely @xmath67 of eq.([j33 ] ) , and two other generators which take the form @xmath68 if we use @xmath34 for the boost generator along the i - th axis , these matrices can be written as @xmath69 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 given in eq.([k12 ] ) .",
    "the generators @xmath70 and @xmath71 satisfy the following set of commutation relations .",
    "@xmath72 = 0 ,",
    "\\qquad [ j_{3 } , n_{1 } ] = in_{2 } , \\qquad [ j_{3 } , n_{2 } ] = -in_{1 } .\\ ] ]    in order to understand the mathematical basis of the above commutation relations , let us consider transformations on a two - dimensional plane with the @xmath73 coordinate system .",
    "we can then make rotations around the origin and translations along the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions .",
    "if we write these generators as @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively , they satisfy the commutation relations  @xcite @xmath76 = 0 , \\qquad [ l , p_{x } ] = ip_{y } , \\qquad [ l , p_{y } ] = -ip_{x } .\\ ] ] this is a closed set of commutation relations for the generators of the @xmath77 group , or the two - dimensional euclidean group .",
    "if we replace @xmath78 and @xmath71 of eq.([e2lcom ] ) by @xmath79 and @xmath75 , and @xmath67 by @xmath39 , the commutations relations for the generators of the @xmath77-like little group becomes those for the @xmath77-like little group .",
    "this is precisely why we say that the little group for massless particles are like @xmath77 .",
    "it is not difficult to associate the rotation generator @xmath67 with the helicity degree of freedom of the massless particle .",
    "then what physical variable is associated with the @xmath78 and @xmath71 generators ? indeed , wigner was the one who discovered the existence of these generators , but did not give any physical interpretation to these translation - like generators in his original paper  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , for many years , only those representations with the zero - eigenvalues of the @xmath80 operators were thought to be physically meaningful representations  @xcite .",
    "it was not until 1971 when janner and janssen reported that the transformations generated by these operators are gauge transformations  @xcite .",
    "the role of this translation - like transformation has also been studied for spin-1/2 particles , and it was concluded that the polarization of neutrinos is due to gauge invariance  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath63-like little group remains @xmath63-like when the particle is lorentz - boosted .",
    "then , what happens when the particle speed becomes the speed of light ?",
    "the energy - momentum relation @xmath61 become @xmath81 .",
    "is there then a limiting case of the @xmath63-like little group ?",
    "since those little groups are like the three - dimensional rotation group and the two - dimensional euclidean group respectively , we are first interested in whether @xmath77 can be obtained from @xmath63 .",
    "this will then give a clue as to how to obtain the @xmath77-like little group as a limiting case of @xmath63-like little group . with this point in mind , let us look into this geometrical problem .",
    "in 1953 , inn and wigner formulated this problem as the contraction of @xmath63 to @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "let us see what they did .",
    "we always associate the three - dimensional rotation group with a spherical surface .",
    "let us consider a circular area of radius one kilometer centered on the north pole of the earth . since the radius of the earth is more than 6,450 times longer , the circular region appears to be flat .",
    "thus , within this region , we use the @xmath77 symmetry group .",
    "the validity of this approximation depends on the ratio of the two radii .",
    "how about then the little groups which are isomorphic to @xmath63 and @xmath77 ?",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the @xmath77-like little group can be obtained as a limiting case of the @xmath63-like little group for massless particles . in 1981 , it was observed by bacry and chang  @xcite and by ferrara and savoy  @xcite that this limiting process is the lorentz boost to infinite - momentum frame .    in 1983 ,",
    "it was noted by han _",
    "et al _ that the large - radius limit in the contraction of @xmath63 to @xmath77 corresponds to the infinite - momentum limit for the case of the @xmath63-like little group to the @xmath77-like little group for massless particles .",
    "they showed that transverse rotation generators become the generators of gauge transformations in the limit of infinite momentum  @xcite .",
    "let us see how this happens .",
    "the @xmath67 operator of eq.([j33 ] ) , which generates rotations around the @xmath11 axis , is not affected by the boost conjugation of the @xmath82 matrix of eq.([boost ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath15 matrices become @xmath83 which are given in eq.([n1n2 ] ) . the generators @xmath78 and @xmath71 are the contracted @xmath15 and @xmath14 respectively in the infinite - momentum . in 1987 ,",
    "kim and wigner studied this problem in more detail and showed that the little group for massless particles is the cylindrical group which is isomorphic to the @xmath77 group  @xcite .",
    "this completes the second row in table  [ einwig ] , where wigner s little group unifies the internal space - time symmetries of massive and massless particles .",
    "the transverse components of the rotation generators become generators of gauge transformations in the infinite - momentum limit .",
    "let us go back to table i given in sec .",
    "[ intro ] .",
    "as for the third row for relativistic extended particles , the most efficient approach is to construct representations of the little groups using the wave functions which can be lorentz - boosted .",
    "this means that we have to construct wave functions which are consistent with all known rules of quantum mechanics and special relativity .",
    "it is possible to construct harmonic oscillator wave functions which satisfy these conditions .",
    "we can then take the low - speed and high - speed limits of the covariant harmonic oscillator wave functions for the quark model and the parton model respectively .",
    "this aspect was extensively discussed in the literature  @xcite , and is beyond the scope of the present report .    however , it is important to note that the covariant harmonic oscillator formalism use for this purpose can serve as the fock space description for the squeezed state of light  @xcite , we give a brief discussion of this aspect in appendix  [ sqosc ] , entitled `` squeezed harmonic oscillators . ''    in this section , we discussed wigner s little groups applicable to internal space - time symmetries of relativistic particles .",
    "however , as we shall see in this paper , these little groups play an important role in understanding ray optics .",
    "conversely , optical configurations in ray optics can serve as analogue computers for space - time symmetries in particle physics .",
    "let us consider two optical beams propagating along the @xmath11 axis .",
    "we are then led to the column vector : @xmath84 we can then achieve a phase shift between the beams by applying the two - by - two matrix : @xmath85 if we are interested in mixing up the two beams , we can apply @xmath86 to the column vector .",
    "if the amplitudes become changed either by attenuation or by reflection , we can use the matrix @xmath87 for the change . in this paper , we are dealing only with the relative amplitudes , or the ratio of the amplitudes . as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ interfer ] , the above two - by - two matrices have their corresponding four - by - four matrices respectively .",
    "repeated applications of these matrices lead to the form @xmath88 where the elements are in general complex numbers .",
    "the determinant of this matrix is one .",
    "thus , the matrix can have six independent parameters .",
    "this matrix takes the identical form as the two - by - two matrix given in eq.([alpha2 ] ) .",
    "however , the construction process is different .",
    "the lie - group generators are used for eq.([alpha2 ] ) , while eq.([alpha2 ] ) is constructed from repeated applications of the transformation matrices .",
    "the difference between these two methods is discussed in appendix  [ euler ] .    in either case , this matrix is the most general form of the matrices in the @xmath26 group , which is known to be the universal covering group for the six - parameter lorentz group .",

    "let us go back to eq.([cycle ] ) .",
    "the expression corresponds to a lorentz boosted rotation , or bringing a moving particle to its rest frame , rotate , and boost back to the original momentum .",
    "the rotation associated with the momentum - preserving transformation is called the wigner s little - group rotation , which is related to the wigner rotation commonly mentioned in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the most efficient way to study multi - layer optics is to use the s - matrix formalism  @xcite .",
    "this formalism is also based on two - by - two matrices , and we can write @xmath207 where @xmath208 and @xmath209 are the incoming , reflected and transmitted beams . here",

    "we consider a system of two different optical layers . for convenience , we start from the boundary from @xmath211 to @xmath212 .",
    "we can write the boundary matrix as  @xcite @xmath213 taking into account both the transmission and reflection of the beam .",
    "the parameter @xmath148 is of course determined by the transmission and reflection coefficient at the surface .",
    "this problem was studied in depth by monzon _",

    "@xcite , and their research on this subject is still continuing .",
    "as the beam goes through the @xmath212 , the beam undergoes the phase shift represented by the matrix @xmath214 when the wave hits the surface of the second medium , the boundary matrix is @xmath215 which is the inverse of the matrix given in eq.([bd11 ] ) . within the second medium ,",

    "it is interesting to note that the lorentz group can serve as a computational device also in multi - layer optics .",
    "we have seen in this report that the lorentz group provides convenient calculational tools in many branches of ray optics .",
    "the reason is that ray optics is largely based on two - by - two matrices .",
    "these matrices also constitute the group @xmath26 which serves as the universal covering group of the lorentz group .",
    "the optical instruments discussed in this report are the fundamental components in optical circuits . in the world of electronics , electric circuits form the fabric of the system . in the future high - technology world",
    ", optical components will hold the key to technological advances . indeed , the lorentz group is the fundamental language for the new world .",
    "it is by now well known that the lorentz group is the basic language for quantum optics .",
    "coherent and squeezed states are representations of the lorentz group .",
    "it is challenging to see how the lorentz nature of the above - mentioned optical components will manifest itself in quantum world .",
    "the lorentz group was introduced to physics by einstein and wigner to understand the space - time symmetries of relativistic particles and the covariant world of electromagnetic fields .",
    "it is gratifying to note that the lorentz group can serve as the language common both to particle physics and optical sciences .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to expand the third row of table  [ einwig ] using the covariant formalism of harmonic oscillators .",
    "we explain first what this formalism does for covariant picture of relativistic extended particles .",
    "we then point out that this oscillator formalism can serve as the basic language for two - mode coherent states  @xcite , namely squeezed states of light .",
    "the concept of localized probability distribution is the backbone of the present formulation of quantum mechanics . of course",
    ", we would like to have more deterministic form of dynamics , and efforts have been and are still being made along this direction .",
    "one of the most serious problems with this probabilistic interpretation is whether this concept of probability is consistent with special relativity .    in a given lorentz frame , we know how to do quantum mechanics with a localized probability distribution . how would this distribution look to an observer in a different lorentz frame ?",
    "* would the probability distribution appear the same to this observer ? * if different , how is the probability distribution distorted ?",
    "* is the total probability conserved ? * the lorentz boost mixes up the spatial coordinate with the time variable .",
    "what role does the time - separation variable play in defining the boundary condition for localization and the probability distribution ?",
    "we can answer some or all of the above questions only if we construct covariant wave functions , namely wave functions which can be lorentz - boosted .",
    "it is easy to construct these wave functions if we know the answer . in the initial development of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the harmonic oscillator played the pivotal role .",
    "thus , it is clear to us that if there is a wave function which can be lorentz - boosted , this has to be the harmonic oscillator wave function . until we construct wave functions",
    "which can be lorentz - transformed , we can not say that quantum mechanics is consistent with relativity .",
    "indeed , we should examine this problem before attempting to invent more definitive quantum mechanics .",
    "since the hadron , in the quark model , is a bound - state of quarks  @xcite , feynman , kislinger , and ravndal , in 1971  @xcite , raised the following question in connection with the quark model for hadrons : the hadronic spectrum can indeed be explained in terms of the degeneracy of three - dimensional harmonic oscillator wave functions in the hadronic rest frame ; however , what happens when the hadron moves ? indeed ,",
    "et al . _ wrote a lorentz - invariant differential equation whose solutions can become non - relativistic wave functions if the time - separation variable can be ignored .",
    "this lorentz - invariant differential equation is a four - dimensional partial differential equation , with many different solutions depending on separation of variables and boundary conditions .",
    "there is a set of normalizable solutions which can serve as a representation space for wigner s little group for massive particles  @xcite",
    ". we can start with this set of solutions and give physical interpretations , especially to the time - separation variable .    finally , is the covariance of the oscillator wave function consistent with what we observe in the real world . here",
    "again , feynman plays the key role .",
    "while the quark model can be fit into the oscillator scheme in the hadronic rest frame , feynman in 1969 came up with the idea of partons  @xcite . according to feynman s parton model ,",
    "the hadron consists of an infinite number of partons when it moves with a velocity close to that of light .",
    "quarks and partons are believed to be the same particles , but their properties are totally different .",
    "while the quarks inside the hadron interact coherently with external signals , partons interact incoherently .",
    "if the partons are lorentz - boosted quarks , does the lorentz boost destroy the coherence ?    before 1964  @xcite , the hydrogen atom was used for illustrating bound states .",
    "these days , we use hadrons which are bound states of quarks .",
    "let us use the simplest hadron consisting of two quarks bound together with an attractive force , and consider their space - time positions @xmath229 and @xmath230 , and use the variables @xmath231 the four - vector @xmath232 specifies where the hadron is located in space and time , while the variable @xmath16 measures the space - time separation between the quarks . according to einstein",
    ", this space - time separation contains a time - like component which actively participates as can be seen from @xmath233 when the hadron is boosted along the @xmath11 direction . in terms of the light - cone variables defined as  @xcite",
    "@xmath234 the boost transformation of eq.([boostm ] ) takes the form @xmath235 the @xmath46 variable becomes expanded while the @xmath48 variable becomes contracted .",
    "does this time - separation variable exist when the hadron is at rest ?",
    "yes , according to einstein .",
    "in the present form of quantum mechanics , we pretend not to know anything about this variable .",
    "indeed , this variable belongs to feynman s rest of the universe . in this report",
    ", we shall see the role of this time - separation variable in the decoherence mechanism .",
    "also in the present form of quantum mechanics , there is an uncertainty relation between the time and energy variables .",
    "however , there are no known time - like excitations . unlike heisenberg s uncertainty relation applicable to position and momentum , the time and energy separation variables are c - numbers , and we are not allowed to write down the commutation relation between them .",
    "how does this space - time asymmetry fit into the world of covariance  @xcite .",
    "the answer is that wigner s @xmath63-like little group is not a lorentz - invariant symmetry , but is a covariant symmetry  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the time - energy uncertainty relation applicable to the time - separation variable fits perfectly into the @xmath63-like symmetry of massive relativistic particles  @xcite .",
    "the c - number time - energy uncertainty relation allows us to write down a time distribution function without excitations  @xcite .",
    "if we use gaussian forms for both space and time distributions , we can start with the expression @xmath236 for the ground - state wave function .",
    "what do feynman _ et al .",
    "_ say about this oscillator wave function ?    in their classic 1971 paper",
    "@xcite , feynman _",
    "_ start with the following lorentz - invariant differential equation . @xmath237",
    "this partial differential equation has many different solutions depending on the choice of separable variables and boundary conditions .",
    "_ insist on lorentz - invariant solutions which are not normalizable . on the other hand ,",
    "if we insist on normalization , the ground - state wave function takes the form of eq.([ground ] ) .",
    "it is then possible to construct a representation of the poincar group from the solutions of the above differential equation  @xcite .",
    "if the system is boosted , the wave function becomes @xmath238 this wave function becomes eq.([ground ] ) if @xmath148 becomes zero .",
    "the transition from eq.([ground ] ) to eq.([eta ] ) is a squeeze transformation .",
    "the wave function of eq.([ground ] ) is distributed within a circular region in the @xmath239 plane , and thus in the @xmath240 plane . on the other hand , the wave function of eq.([eta ] )",
    "is distributed in an elliptic region with the light - cone axes as the major and minor axes respectively .",
    "if @xmath148 becomes very large , the wave function becomes concentrated along one of the light - cone axes .",
    "indeed , the form given in eq.([eta ] ) is a lorentz - squeezed wave function .",
    "this lorentz - squeeze mechanism is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ellipse ] .",
    "there are many different solutions of the lorentz invariant differential equation of eq.([osceq ] ) .",
    "the solution given in eq.([eta ] ) is not lorentz invariant but is covariant .",
    "it is normalizable in the @xmath241 variable , as well as in the space - separation variable @xmath11 .",
    "how can we extract probability interpretation from this covariant wave function ?",
    "this issue has been discussed thoroughly in the literature  @xcite .",
    "another pressing problem in physics is that hadrons , like the proton , can be regarded as quantum bound states of quarks when they move slowly .",
    "however , they appear like collections of partons when they move with velocity very close to that of light  @xcite . since the quarks and partons have quite different properties , it is a challenging problem in modern physics to show that they are the same but appear different depending on the observer s lorentz frame .",
    "it has been shown that this lorentz - squeezed wave function can explain the quark model and the parton model as two different manifestations of one covariant entity  @xcite .",
    "thus , the covariant harmonic oscillator can occupy the third row of table  [ einwig ] .",

    ", this expression describes the two - photon coherent state discussed first by yuen in 1976  @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath26 consists of two - by - two unimodular matrices whose elements are complex .",
    "there are therefore six independent parameters , and thus six generators of the lie algebra .",
    "this group is locally isomorphic to the six - parameter lorentz group or @xmath247 applicable to the minkowskian space of three space - like directions and one time - like direction .",
    "we can construct representations of the group starting from the lie algebra given in secs .",
    "[ lorentz ] and [ spinor ] .",
    "we can construct the representation by using a method similar to what goldstein did for the three - dimensional rotation group in terms of the euler angles  @xcite .",
    "there are three - generators for the rotation group , but goldstein starts with rotations around the @xmath11 and @xmath16 directions .",
    "rotations around the @xmath17 axis and the most general form for the rotation matrix can be constructed from repeated applications of those two starting matrices .",
    "let us call this type of approach the `` euler construction . ''    in constructing the lorentz group ,",
    "we observe first that we need rotations around two different directions . as for the boost , we need boosts along one given direction since boots along other directions can be achieved by rotations .",
    "there are three basic advantages of this approach .",
    "first , the number of `` starter '' matrices is less than the number of generators .",
    "for example , we need only two starters for the three - parameter rotation group . in our case",
    ", we started with two matrices for the three - parameter group @xmath8 and also for @xmath9 .",
    "second , each starter matrix takes a simple form and has its own physical interpretation .",
    "the third advantage can be stated in the following way .",
    "repeated applications of the starter matrices will lead to a very complicated expression .",
    "however , the complicated expression can be decomposed into the minimum number of starter matrices . for example",
    ", this number is three for the three - dimensional rotation group .",
    "this number is also three for @xmath91 and @xmath8 .",
    "we call this the euler decomposition .",
    "the present paper is based on both the euler construction and the euler decomposition .    among the several useful euler decompositions",
    ", the iwasawa decomposition plays an important role in the lorentz group .",
    "we have seen in this paper what the decomposition does to the two - by - two matrices of @xmath8 , but it has been an interesting subject since iwasawa s first publication on this subject  @xcite .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to present a historical review of the subject .",
    "however , we would like to point out that there are areas of physics where this important mathematical theorem was totally overlooked .    for instance",
    ", in particle theory , wigner s little groups dictate the internal space - time symmetries of massive and massless particles which are locally isomorphic to @xmath63 and @xmath77 respectively  @xcite .",
    "the little group is the maximal subgroup of the lorentz group whose transformations do not change the four - momentum of a given particle  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath77-like subgroup for massless particles is locally isomorphic to the subgroup of @xmath26 which can be started from one of the matrices in eq.([shear1 ] ) and the diagonal matrix of eq.([ps11 ] ) .",
    "thus there was an underlying iwasawa decomposition while the @xmath77-like subgroup was decomposed into rotation and boost matrices  @xcite , but the authors did not know this .    in optics ,",
    "there are two - by - two matrices with one vanishing off - diagonal element .",
    "it was generally known that this has something to do with the iwasawa effect , but simon and mukunda  @xcite and han _ et al . _",
    "@xcite started treating the iwasawa decomposition as the main issue in their papers on polarized light .    in para - axial lens optics , the matrices of the form given in eq.([shear1 ] )",
    "are the starters , and repeated applications of those two starters will lead to the most general form of @xmath8 matrices .",
    "it had been a challenging problem since 1985  @xcite to write the most general two - by - two matrix in lens optics in terms the minimum number of those starter matrices .",
    "this problem has been solved recently  @xcite , and the central issue in the problem was the iwasawa decomposition .",
    "the core matrix of eq.([core ] ) contains the chain of the matrices @xmath248 the lorentz group allows us to simplify this expression under certain conditions .    for this purpose , we transform the above expression into a more convenient form , by taking the conjugate of each of the matrices with @xmath249 then @xmath250 leads to @xmath251 in this way , we have converted @xmath252 of eq.([su11 ] ) into a real matrix , but it is not simple enough .      after multiplication , the matrix of eq.([abcd ] ) will take the form @xmath259 where @xmath260 and @xmath261 are real numbers .",
    "if @xmath82 and @xmath131 vanish , this matrix will become diagonal , and the problem will become too simple . if , on the other hand , only one of these two elements become zero , we will achieve a substantial mathematical simplification and will be encouraged to look for physical circumstances which will lead to this simplification .",
    "let us summarize .",
    "we started in this section with the matrix representation @xmath252 given in eq.([su11 ] ) .",
    "this form can be transformed into the @xmath56 matrix of eq.([abcd ] ) through the conjugate transformation @xmath262 where @xmath131 is given in eq.([ccc ] ) .",
    "conversely , we can recover the @xmath252 representation by @xmath263 for calculational purposes , the @xmath56 representation is much easier because we are dealing with real numbers . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath252 representation is of the form for the s - matrix we intend to compute .",
    "it is gratifying to see that they are equivalent .",
    "let us go back to eq.([abcd ] ) and consider the case where the angles @xmath110 and @xmath226 satisfy the following constraints .",
    "@xmath264 thus @xmath265 then in terms of @xmath108 , we can reduce the matrix of eq.([abcd ] ) to the form @xmath266 thus the matrix takes a surprisingly simple form if the parameters @xmath108 and @xmath148 satisfy the constraint @xmath267then the matrix becomes @xmath268 this aspect of the lorentz group is known as the iwasawa decomposition  @xcite , and has been discussed in the optics literature  @xcite .",
    "matrices of this form are not so strange in optics . in para - axial lens optics ,",
    "the translation and lens matrices are written as @xmath269 respectively .",
    "these matrices have the following interesting mathematical property  @xcite , @xmath270 and @xmath271 we note that the multiplication is commutative , and the parameter becomes additive .",
