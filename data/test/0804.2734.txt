    "stellar clusters are among the most interesting objects in astronomy .",
    "we are interested in how they form , how they evolve and how they die .",
    "observations gave the evidence that most stars are not born independently but in stellar clusters or stellar associations which are formed in molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "due to the limits of observational techniques , we do not know in detail the relation between the clusters and the parent molecular clouds .",
    "it is believed that stars are born in clusters and become field stars after the clusters disassociate .",
    "recently , near infrared observational data ( 2mass , two micron all sky survey project at ipac / caltech ) have shown that the number of embedded clusters is much higher than the number of optical clusters for which the parent clouds have already dissipated and that the survival probability for embedded clusters in milky way is about 4% to 7% ( @xcite ) .",
    "similar evidences for infant mortality are found in antennae galaxies ( @xcite ) , small magellanic cloud ( @xcite ) and ngc1313 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these imply that clusters are likely to be disrupted before the clouds are dissipated completely . since the time the clusters were born , they are under constant threats from their surrounding environment",
    ".    galactic tidal forces , close encounters with giant molecular clouds ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , shock heating and mass loss by massive member stars ( see e.g. , @xcite ) are possible disruption mechanisms .",
    "nonetheless , most of these mechanisms have a destruction timescale longer than the upper limit of the lifetime of molecular clouds which is about few to few tens myr ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the results of co observations in the galaxy suggest that the lifetime of molecular clouds is of the order of 10 myr ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the estimation of the timescale for photoevaporation and statistics on the expected numbers of stars per cloud show that giant molecular clouds of mass 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 are expected to survive for about 30 myr ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ".    generally speaking , mechanisms with destruction timescales less than the lifetime of the clouds should be responsible for the low survival probability mentioned above . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the role played by the dispersion of the parent cloud on the early evolution of the embedded clusters .    in the beginning",
    ", the clusters are bound to their parent molecular cloud .",
    "as the cloud dissipates , the binding energy from the cloud decreases and the stellar systems become out of equilibrium .",
    "once out of equilibrium , they may expand or dissociate completely .",
    "the survivability of clusters under gas dispersion has been examined in the past and extensive n - body simulations were performed in the past few years ( see e.g @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in a large set of simulations , @xcite studied the dispersal of the residual gas by decreasing the mass with different star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , and in different tidal fields .",
    "they concluded that the clusters had to form with sfe @xmath2 30% in order to survive gas expulsion , and the external tidal fields have significant influences only if the ratio of half mass radius to tidal radius is larger than 0.05 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite addressed similar problem and found that the embedded clusters would be destroyed within a few tens of myr if the `` effective star formation efficiency '' @xmath3 30% ( esfe@xmath4 , and q=0.5 for virial equilibrium ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we describe the model and parameters for our simulations . in section  3 ,",
    "we present and discuss the results and statistics of the simulations . a summary and some remarks",
    "are provided in section  4 .",
    "we intend to learn the behaviour of a star cluster in a dispersing molecular cloud . for simplicity",
    ", we do not consider the feedback of the cluster onto the cloud , and the cloud is simply represented by its gravitational force . in other words , we study the behaviour of a star cluster in a time varying gravitational field .",
    "we adopted the n - body simulation code nbody2 developed by @xcite for our calculations .",
    "as a first attempt , we assume a spherically symmetric external potential ( representing the molecular cloud ) , and initially the centre of mass of the cluster coincides with the centre of the potential .",
    "the initial spatial and velocity distributions of the cluster depend on the initial profile of the external potential ( i.e. , the initial mass and compactness of the cloud ) .",
    "subsequent evolution of the cluster depends , of course , on its initial distribution and the rate of dispersion of the external potential .",
    "the cloud is represented by a plummer potential ,    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the total mass of the cloud , @xmath7 is the length scale of the potential and @xmath8 is the gravitational constant . to model the dispersion of the cloud we consider the potential to evolve in time according to @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the initial length scale and the dispersion rate of the cloud , respectively .",
    "the total mass of the cloud remains constant as the length scale increases with time .",
    "stellar masses would change by stellar evolution . however , since we run our simulations for 30 myr only ( which is about the maximum life time of molecular clouds ) and massive stars are rare , hence we do not consider stellar evolution in this work .",
    "there are three parameters for the cloud : ( i ) dispersion rate @xmath11 , ( ii ) total mass @xmath6 , and ( iii ) initial length scale @xmath10 .",
    "we take @xmath11 as 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 in the unit used by the code .",
    "these correspond to a e - fold time @xmath12 as 3.3 , 1.5 , 1.1 , 0.75 , 0.625 myr in real unit ( see table  [ para_time ] ) .",

    "we repeat all the simulations for clusters with equal mass ( i.e. , each star is 1 @xmath17 ) .",
    "note that the number of stars and the total mass of the cluster are the same as those clusters with mass function ( see  [ sec : massfunc ] ) .",
    "the three generic groups : destroyed , loose and compact core are still applicable in the case of equal mass clusters . fig .",

    ", width=283 ]      it is conceivable that the dispersion of a molecular cloud may destroy its embedded infant star clusters .",
    "the question is how effective is the process . from our simulation results , we deem that the process is not very effective .",
    "infant clusters can be destroyed only when the @xmath19 cluster - cloud mass ratio @xmath13 is below some value .",
    "specifically , @xmath25 ( @xmath13 at @xmath18 ) in table  [ lsfe_result ] ( also see fig .  [ beta_im ] ) . from the cases we considered , many infant clusters survive ( some of them are loosened while some develop a compact core ) .",

    "more than 30% for equal mass clusters and more than 40% for salpeter mass function develop a compact core .",
    "we should point out that the boundaries ( @xmath26 2 and 10 ) between the three groups compact core , loose and destroyed are determined partly by eyes ( from the spatial , velocity and mass distribution such as in fig .",

    "the boundaries between loose and destroyed ( @xmath18 ) we pick may not be precise . however , we claim that the exact location of the boundary ( if there is an extra one ) does not affect the estimated destroyed frequency listed in table  [ i m ] . as we discussed in  [ sec : ratio ] there is a transition zone between @xmath26 5 to 10 where only very few cases exist ( see fig .",

    "we conclude that the infant mortality rate should be low if the embedded clusters are bound from the beginning , unless @xmath13 is less than about 0.13 ( for slow dispersion , such as @xmath30 myr ) to 0.30 ( for rapid dispersion , such as @xmath29 myr ) ( see table  [ lsfe_result ] ) .    near infrared observations",
