    "understanding and controlling entanglement in many - body systems is one of the most important challenges in quantum mechanics today .",
    "the rewards are significant and are expected to not only lead to new insights into the properties of solid state systems and phase transitions @xcite , but also to new designs for highly efficient quantum information devices .",
    "ultra - cold bosonic gases offer an ideal arena to explore many - body entanglement , as experimentalists have at their disposal _ designer _",
    "condensed matter systems whose parameters can be controlled with unprecedented precision @xcite .",
    "entanglement often exists naturally in the ground state of a many - body system @xcite , where it resides between the degrees of freedom of the particles and is a property of the first quantised many - body wavefunction .",
    "however , in ultra - cold gases the particles are inherently indistinguishable , which requires the symmetization of their many - body wavefunction and means that the hilbert space no longer has the tensor product structure required to define entanglement .",
    "the first quantised many - body wavefunction of indistinguishable particles may therefore contain quantum correlations @xcite , but such correlations are usually considered unable to violate a bell inequality or process quantum information @xcite .",
    "ultra - cold gases are also well described within the framework of second quantisation , where instead of working directly with the many - body wavefunction , one defines a complete set of field modes that are occupied by particles .",
    "second quantisation therefore offers the possibility of entanglement between modes .",
    "entanglement is dependent on the choice of modes , but provided the correct choice is made , investigating entanglement between _ distinguishable _ modes @xcite circumvents the difficulties of defining entanglement between indistinguishable particles @xcite .    to illustrate the differences between particle and mode entanglement ,",
    "let us consider two non - interacting bosons in a trap at zero temperature . in first quantisation ,",
    "the wavefunction is the symmetrized product , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the ground state of the confining potential .",
    "no entanglement exists between the particles , since indistinguishability forbids us from assigning to any particle a specific set of degrees of freedom .",
    "conversely , in second quantisation one can define a pair of spatial modes , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where each mode occupies half the confining geometry .",
    "since both the particles are coherently distributed over these modes , the system is described by the entangled state , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes @xmath6 particles in mode @xmath2 and @xmath7 particles in mode @xmath3 ( with @xmath8 ) .    in this paper",
    "we outline a scheme for the detection of bi - mode and multi - mode spatial entanglement for a finite temperature , interacting bose gas of any ( including unknown ) particle number .",
    "we show that entanglement is detected via the single - particle reduced density matrix ( sprdm ) .",
    "we apply our scheme to the example of a harmonically trapped , interacting boson pair @xcite , where the sprdm also acts as a quantifier of entanglement .",
    "we find that for all interaction strengths , entanglement between pairs of modes rapidly decreases with temperature . while at zero temperature a significant amount of entanglement remains even in the limit of infinite interaction .",
    "moreover , we note that our detection scheme is also relevant to recent proposals to observe non - locality of single particle between spatial modes @xcite .     and @xmath9 .",
    "the modes are combined at a @xmath10 beamsplitter and the particles in the output modes @xmath11 and @xmath12 are counted . ]",
    "the correlations of entanglement are locally basis independent , so that one needs to measure each mode in at least two bases in order to differentiate them from classical correlations .",
    "while a superselection rule that forbids coherent superpositions of eigenstates of different mass @xcite seems to rule such measurements out for any atomic system , recent work has shown that such measurements are theoretically possible @xcite . moreover , it has recently been predicted that this natural mode entanglement of massive particles can be used as a resource for quantum communication @xcite",
    ". however , in practice it will be difficult to locally manipulate , i.e.  rotate , the spatial modes . in the following",
    "we will show that spatial entanglement can also be detected and quantified by making _",
    "operations on the modes .",
    "let us consider a gas in a confining geometry ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) which is mathematically , but not necessarily physically , divided into two , non - overlapping spatial modes , @xmath13 and @xmath9 .",
    "the field operators , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , create and destroy particles in mode @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ensures that the commutation relations , @xmath18=\\delta_{ij}$ ] , are satisfied .",
    "the quantity , @xmath19 , specifies how the set of points in a spatial mode are averaged over . to generate interference ,",
    "the particles in the two spatial modes , @xmath13 and @xmath9 , are mixed at a 50:50 beamsplitter , which transforms the input modes as @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "after the beamsplitting operation , the number of particles in the output modes , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are counted and compared to the fully separable case .",
    "if the number of coincidences is different to the separable case , we can conclude that there must have been entanglement between the spatial modes .",
    "a bosonic gas of fixed particle number , @xmath22 which is in a fully separable state w.r.t .  the spatial modes @xmath13 and @xmath9 can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the beamsplitter transforms this state such that if the total number of particles is even , one detects the same number of particles in each of the output modes , i.e.  @xmath25 . for an odd number of particles an ensemble average leads to the same result @xcite .",
    "conversely , if the initial state of fixed particle number is of an arbitrary form , @xmath26 , the difference in particle numbers detected in the modes @xmath11 and @xmath12 may be non - zero due to entanglement between the modes . @xmath27",

    "when @xmath34 is non - zero , the state @xmath26 is different to the separable case and is therefore necessarily entangled w.r.t . the bi - modal split into @xmath13 and @xmath9 .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 is given by the off - diagonal elements of the sprdm which is defined as @xmath35 . here @xmath36 is the number of bosons that occupy the @xmath37-th momentum mode .",
    "the sprdm is a one - body correlation function , which characterises important coherence properties of a many - body system @xcite and its off - diagonal elements are related to the visibility of interference fringes in a two slit experiment @xcite .",
    "our scheme therefore applies to systems whose correlations from a basic group of one particle @xcite . states of the form , @xmath38 , whose correlations are second order are not detected by the sprdm .",
    "such states require careful engineering of bosonic systems @xcite , although they may form naturally in fermionic systems , i.e.   cooper pairs in superconductors .",
    "our scheme is applicable to all bosonic gases trapped in orthodox geometries .",
    "next , let us show that @xmath34 can also be used to _ quantify _ mode entanglement for certain systems , one of which is the boson pair model discussed below .",
    "for this @xmath34 must fulfil three basic criteria @xcite : (",
    "i ) @xmath34 is zero when the state is separable , ( ii ) @xmath34 is invariant under local unitary operations and ( iii ) @xmath34 does not increase under local general measurements and classical communication ( lgm+cc ) . the validity of ( i ) is shown above and ( ii ) is guaranteed since the trace is basis independent",
    ". one can prove ( iii ) as follows . to implement lgm+cc , the two spatial modes , @xmath13 and @xmath9 , are each coupled to a local environment by a general completely positive map .",
    "the environments are allowed to communicate classically ad infinitum and the total number of particles in the gas and environment is fixed .",
    "one can then show that @xmath34 does not increase under lgm+cc .",
    "the above scheme can also analyse multi - mode entanglement , i.e.  the simultaneous entanglement of more than two modes . in the following we use the different notions of separability discussed in @xcite .",
    "a general @xmath39-mode state is fully separable and contains no entanglement if it is a convex combination of states for each mode , @xmath40 . here",
    "each composite state , @xmath41 corresponds to a single spatial mode with a fixed number of particles . on the other hand",
    ", entanglement may be present between certain subsets of spatial modes , for which one can define a @xmath42-separable state , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 with equality when the state is fully separable as above .",
    "when the composite state , @xmath41 describes more than one spatial mode , the spatial modes contained within @xmath45 are necessarily entangled otherwise @xmath45 would be written as a product of states for the individual modes , @xmath46 , and the overall state of the system would be @xmath47-separable , where @xmath48 @xcite .    to determine whether a given @xmath39-mode state contains multi - mode entanglement",
    ", one can check a bi - partite entanglement criterion between all @xmath49 unique divisions of the system into two _ blocks _ , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . depending on which pairs of blocks",
    "are found to be separable one can conclude that the state has entanglement between different subsets of spatial modes . here",
    "the bipartite entanglement criterion is @xmath50 $ ] of eq .  ,",
    "i.e.  the sprdm between two blocks of spatial modes , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . the field operators , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , for blocks of spatial modes are defined as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 ensures that the commutation relations , @xmath59=\\delta _ { { x } , { y}}$ ] , are satisfied .",
    "we now describe how entanglement changes for the ( i ) fully separable ( ii ) the @xmath42-separable and ( iii ) the fully entangled states : ( i ) the fully separable state , @xmath60 , admits no interference between all @xmath49 partitions into blocks , i.e. @xmath61 for all @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "( ii ) a @xmath42-separable state , @xmath62 where @xmath63 , admits no interference for @xmath64 partitions into blocks from the total of @xmath49 partitions , i.e.  @xmath65 for @xmath64 choices of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "temperature is scaled in units of @xmath71 . ]",
    "in the following we will apply our scheme to the physically realistic model of a harmonically trapped pair of ultracold , interacting , bosonic atoms in effectively one dimension .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system is given by @xmath72 where all lengths are scaled in units of the ground state size and all energies in units of the harmonic frequency .",
    "the one dimensional coupling constant , @xmath73 , is related to the three dimensional @xmath74-wave scattering length by @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the constant , @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian can be decoupled by moving into the centre of mass and relative coordinate frames labelled by @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively , @xcite and the two - body wavefunction can subsequently be written as @xmath80 .",
    "the eigenvalues for the centre of mass motion are given by @xmath81 for @xmath82 , with corresponding eigenstates , @xmath83 . here",
    "@xmath84 is the normalisation constant and @xmath85 are the hermite polynomials . for the relative motion ,",
    "the single particle eigenstates are @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and the @xmath88 are the confluent hypergeometric functions .",
    "the corresponding eigenenergies , @xmath89 , are determined by the roots of the implicit relation @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the kernel of the density operator in position representation is @xmath91 , with the sprdm defined as @xmath92 the sprdm in thermal equilibrium is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the boltzmann weight , @xmath95 , @xmath96 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath97 is the partition function .",
    "we define two equal length modes , @xmath13 and @xmath9 , and calculate their spatial entanglement for the boson pair model as a function of temperature and interaction strength using eq .  .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermal ] . with increasing temperature",
    "the gas becomes a statistical mixture of momentum modes , @xmath98 , which destroys the fixed relative phase between the spatial modes and consequently the entanglement between them is severely depleted .",
    "the presence of interaction also degrades the quality of the entanglement at @xmath99 , but a significant amount persists even in the tonks - girardeau limit , of impenetrable bosons , @xmath100 . at first",
    "this may seem surprising , since in the tonks - girardeau limit the system can be mapped onto an ideal fermionic atom pair @xcite , for which one may not expect any entanglement to be present .",

    "however is not a monotonic function of @xmath73 and decreases after the initial rise . for @xmath109 and @xmath110",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the behaviour of entanglement in both graphs can be explained by the delocalisation of the bosons away from the centre of the trap due to greater interaction strengths .",
    "stronger interaction therefore increases the correlation length ( i.e. the entanglement between the outer two modes ) , yet decreases the overall coherence of the sample .",
    "we also check the existence of multi - mode entanglement in our model . for this",
    "we have divided our two - particle wavefunction into @xmath39 modes and calculated @xmath111 for the @xmath49 unique partitions of these modes into two blocks , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "recall that , @xmath111 , must be non - zero for all possible block combinations for the state to be fully entangled .",
    "we have found that at zero temperature the system possesses full multi - mode entanglement , i.e.  @xmath67 for all @xmath2 and @xmath3 , for a wide range of values of the interaction parameter , provided that the set of modes are defined within the coherence length of the sample .",
    "here we have used the repulsively , interacting boson pair model to illustrate our scheme , since it is analytically tractable and contains all the essential features of larger models . our scheme to detect bi- and multi - mode entanglement",
    "can also be applied to bose gases with a greater number of particles ( for all interaction strengths and temperatures ) , but qualitatively the results will remain unchanged while the task of computing the single - particle reduced density matrix between modes will quickly become very demanding .",
    "we note that bi - mode entanglement of a non - interacting bose gas has been studied before for @xmath22 particles at zero temperature @xcite and at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "our scheme can be implemented using currently available technologies .",
    "atomic beamsplitters can be realised with optical potentials @xcite and separate modes can be defined using spatially selective outcoupling techniques @xcite . to perform beamsplitting , on systems with strong interactions",
    "one should raise a potential barrier between the desired modes on a non - adiabatic time scale so that the coherences between the regions are not lost , ( i.e. so that the gas does not enter a mott - like state ) .",
    "the potential barrier should then be lowered rapidly enough so that the coupling between the wells is greater than the on - site interaction energy of the wells .",
    "for instance , one could envisage a setup where the trap is swiftly modulated from harmonic to double - well potential and is then switched off and the sample left to interfere .",
    "the entanglement can be inferred according to eq . from the visibility of the resulting interference fringes ,",
    "see for example @xcite , where mode entanglement between regions of space has already been measured indirectly .",
    "we have outlined a scheme that detects bi - modal and multi - modal spatial entanglement of cold bosonic gases using simple atom - optic techniques .",
    "we show that spatial entanglement is detected by the sprdm between different modes , a quantity that is related to the visibility of routinely measured interference fringes .",
    "we have demonstrated our scheme using the model of a harmonically trapped boson pair and have found the existence of bi- and multi - mode entanglement within the gas . for all interaction strengths , increasing temperature rapidly degrades the amount of entanglement , but at zero temperature entanglement still remains , even in the presence of strong interactions .",
    "therefore , we have shown that the ability to vary the particle interaction strength allows one to engineer the distribution of entanglement over the trap , thus allowing a tunable source of entanglement .",
