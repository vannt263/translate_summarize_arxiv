    "therefore the study of the amount , distribution and kinematics of the icl may provide information on the cluster accretion history and evolutionary state , as well as about the evolution of cluster galaxies .",

    "several studies investigated the properties of the icl in the core of the nearby virgo cluster ( feldmeier  1998 , 2003 , 2004 ; arnaboldi  2002 , 2003 ; aguerri  2005 ) and around m49 ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "early attempts to measure spectra for icpn in virgo ( arnaboldi  2003 , 2004 ; doherty  2009 ) provided spectra for 52 single pns around m87 and the virgo core .",

    "the sparsely sampled projected phase - space of these pns that was built from their line - of - sight velocity ( @xmath4 ) vs. radial distance from the center of m87 was probing regions with different kinematics . the halo of m87 was clearly detected as a high density region centered around its systemic velocity ( 1300 kms@xmath1 ) , and a broad line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) was measured at distances of 2000 arcsec and larger .",
    "such broad losvd is reminiscent of the velocity distribution of the galaxies in the virgo cluster ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* binggeli  1987 ) ) .",
    "the recent , extended pn survey carried out by ( * ? ? ? * longobardi  ( 2013 ) ) represents a major increase with respect with previous sample in the same m87 area of a factor 15 . with",

    "* reid & parker 2010 ) ) .",
    "the similarity of the ic pnlf with those observed for low - luminosity , low metallicity , star forming irregulars support the identification of these galaxies as likely progenitors of the stars that are now found associated with the icl in the virgo cluster core ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the fluxes of the brightest pns are four times fainter .",
    "hence the pn [ oiii]@xmath35007  emission can not be detected using a narrow band filter because the sky noise in a @xmath14   window centered on the red - shifted [ oiii ] pn emission is of the same order as the signal from such line .",
    "a step forward for the detection of pn in elliptical galaxies in clusters at distances larger than 20 mpc is to decrease significantly the sky noise .",
    "this is achieved with the multi slit imaging spectroscopy technique ( msis ; ( * ? ? ?",
