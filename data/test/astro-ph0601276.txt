    "inflation @xcite has proven to be a fantastically successful paradigm for explaining why the universe is so big , so old , and so flat , and provides a mechanism for generating the primordial cosmological perturbations . however",
    ", a fundamental description of the physics responsible for inflation remains elusive : no convincing model for inflation yet exists .",
    "we can , however , discern the broad characteristics of the inflationary epoch from observational data .",
    "the absence of a detectable gravitational wave contribution to the cmb ( cosmic microwave background ) anisotropies tells us that the energy density of the universe during inflation was something less than @xmath2 .",
    "the fact that the primordial perturbation spectrum is close to scale invariant tells us that the potential function of the field or fields responsible for inflation ( the _ inflaton _ ) must be very flat .",
    "finally , the highly suppressed amplitude of the perturbation spectrum ( @xmath3 ) requires the introduction of a small parameter to the inflationary lagrangian , either as a small self - coupling or as a hierarchy of mass scales .",
    "probably the best guess as to the fundamental origin of the inflationary potential is that the inflaton ( if there is only one ) is an effective degree of freedom in the low - energy limit of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the last few years have seen substantial progress toward realizing this hypothesis within string theory @xcite , but no dominant and compelling stringy model of inflation has emerged , and string phenomenology is far from fully understood . in this context , effective field theory is a powerful tool . since the inflaton potential is tightly constrained by data , if the inflaton field takes on a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) at which higher order operators contribute significantly to the potential , it is very unlikely that the delicate balance between the height and slope of the potential will survive intact . therefore effective",
    "field theory arguments favor a vev for the inflaton which is small in planck units : @xmath4 .",
    "lyth @xcite derived a lower bound on the variation in the inflaton field during inflation in terms of the ratio @xmath5 between tensor and scalar perturbations generated during inflation , known as the _ lyth bound_. combined with a theoretical prejudice based on effective field theory , the lyth bound predicts a strong suppression of primordial gravitational waves relative to the observed amplitude of the scalar perturbations .    the significance of the lyth bound has been the subject of much debate .",
    "in particular , linde has argued that only the _ energy density _ during inflation must be sub - planckian and that field values greater than @xmath1 are physically consistent @xcite , but this argument does not apply to generic supergravity or superstring inspired models @xcite .",
    "lyth s argument is restricted to single field models , and multifield models can evade it in two ways .",
    "firstly , one might imagine that several separate inflationary epochs are concatenated together .",
    "secondly , the large number of scalar fields introduced by the string landscape makes it natural to look for implementations of _ assisted inflation _",
    "@xcite where a large number of similar ( if not identical ) scalar fields act cooperatively to drive inflation .",
    "the resulting cosmology mimics that produced by a single field with a large vev , but the individual fields never take on trans - planckian expectation values .",
    "a concrete example of this approach is provided by `` n - flation '' @xcite .",
    "questions surrounding the robustness and generality of the lyth bound will only grow in importance as measurements of the perturbation spectrum put ever tighter constraints on the amplitude of primordial tensor fluctuations @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we do not attempt to resolve the debate about the self - consistency of effective field theory in inflation , but simply pose the question : if we suppose that future observations show a strongly suppressed amplitude of primordial tensor fluctuations , what will that tell us about the inflaton potential ?    to investigate this question , we derive an extended version of the lyth bound accurate to higher order in slow roll .",
    "this allows us to connect the field variation @xmath0 to the spectral index of scalar perturbations , as well as to the amplitude of tensor modes .",
    "we then investigate the implications of this bound for `` small field '' potentials , where the field rolls off a local maximum of the potential .",
    "we find that , in the absence of fine - tuning , the field variation during the inflationary period is _ generically _ of order @xmath1 , even for models with a very small tensor / scalar ratio .",
    "specifically , near the end of inflation , the field variation is rapid enough to ensure that @xmath6 during the last e - fold of expansion .",
    "this is true even when the field variation is small during the epoch in which the observable perturbations are generated .",
    "we show that this `` last e - fold problem '' can only be solved by suppressing the inflaton mass term  either by fine - tuning or the imposition of a symmetry .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows : section [ sec : extendedlythbound ] derives the higher - order extension of the lyth bound .",

    "inflationary cosmology predicts the existence of a spectrum of large - scale tensor fluctuations ( gravitational waves ) in addition to scalar fluctuations ( adiabatic density perturbations ) . both are expected to contribute to the measured temperature anisotropy and polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and",
    "different inflationary models predict varying contributions .",
    "the relative contributions are quantified in terms of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the amplitudes of tensor and scalar perturbations , respectively , and @xmath9 is the first hubble slow - roll parameter @xmath10 there is much interest in the possible detection of a tensor contribution to the cmb temperature anisotropy .",
    "upcoming cmb missions will have vastly increased sensitivity to the b - mode polarization signal characteristic of gravitational radiation .",
    "the planck satellite @xcite will have the sensitivity to detect @xmath11 and successors such as nasa s inflation probe @xcite may achieve a sensitivity of @xmath12 or better @xcite .",
    "direct detection of the primordial gravitational wave background with the envisioned big bang observer mission @xcite has a projected sensitivity of @xmath13 @xcite . together with the cobe normalization , @xmath14 , a detection of tensor fluctuations will ( assuming a nearly scale - invariant spectrum )",
    "fix the energy scale of inflation via the relation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the height of the inflationary potential when scales of cosmological interest exited the horizon .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath17 and @xmath18 to lowest order in slow roll , a measurement of tensor modes will also reveal information about @xmath19 when slow roll is valid .",
    "detection of the b - mode will therefore constrain the shape of the inflaton potential enough to eliminate many currently viable inflationary models .",
    "the discovery of primordial gravity waves is therefore a valuable and exciting prospect .",
    "however , there are theoretical arguments which suggest that the amplitude of the tensor component is expected to be well below current observational limits .",
    "lyth @xcite showed that the amplitude of the tensor component ( and therefore @xmath5 ) depends on the total inflaton field variation , @xmath20 , during the time that observable scales exit the horizon . from the expression @xmath21 and by using eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) , it is possible to write the field variation as a function of @xmath5 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "it is assumed that there is negligible variation in @xmath5 over the period @xmath24 , which is a good approximation to lowest order in slow roll . in his original paper , lyth considered @xmath20 as scales corresponding to @xmath25 were exiting the horizon , during which time the universe expands by an amount @xmath26 .",
    "since this gives a lower limit on the total field variation , the result is an inequality known as the _ lyth bound _ :",
    "@xmath27 this indicates that for sizeable values of @xmath5 , the inflaton field must roll a distance of order @xmath1 while observable scales are exiting the horizon .",
    "field variations @xmath28 are , in fact , ubiquitous in inflationary model - building , and essential for the success of chaotic inflation and certain models based on symmetry breaking potentials .",
    "such a large field variation may , however , be problematic from the standpoint of effective field theory if the underlying inflationary model is embedded in either supergravity or string theory .",
    "it is widely believed that inflation can be appropriately described by the evolution of a fundamental scalar field : a field existing in the low energy limit of some more fundamental theory such as supergravity or string theory .",
    "it is possible to describe these fundamental theories at low energies by an effective field theory , obtained by integrating out high momentum degrees of freedom and rescaling fields and coupling constants .",
    "an effective field theory description of inflation thus involves an effective potential for the inflaton of the form @xmath29 the terms of order @xmath30 have couplings of negative mass dimension , and are therefore nonrenormalizable",
    ". however , provided @xmath31 , the nonrenormalizable terms remain under control and the series is at least asymptotically convergent .",
    "therefore , if we hope to be able to make observable predictions based on an effective field theory , we need @xmath32 as the scales relevant to these predictions are leaving the horizon .",
    "this is a conservative estimate : while we work with the full planck mass , the appropriate vertex factor for a loop expansion in gravity is actually the reduced planck mass , @xmath33 , about a factor of five smaller . ensuring that this relationship holds can easily lower the amplitude of the tensor modes to the point where they are effectively undetectable",
    "this strong theoretical prior on the inflationary model space is a stringent constraint on a key inflationary observable and we now ask : can the lyth bound can be extended to constrain other observables ?",

    "rather , we take the view that observations will eventually either determine the value of @xmath5 or place a tight upper bound on its value , and we investigate the theoretical implications of these different possibilities .",
    "lyth s original discussion considered only the field variation during the interval during which perturbations relevant to the lowest multipole moments cmb were being laid down , relevant to the detectable signal from gravitational waves .",
    "we extend this result in two ways .",
    "firstly , we include next - to - leading order terms in the slow - roll expansion , which yields an expression for @xmath20 which depends on both @xmath5 , and the scalar spectral index @xmath37 . secondly , we consider the field variation over the final 60 e - foldings of inflation which gives a tighter constraint on the overall model space .",
    "in particular , we found that the field point generically evolves by an amount close to @xmath1 during the final moments of inflation , leading to what we have dubbed the `` last e - fold problem '' : almost all _ minimally coupled , single field _",
    "inflationary models will have @xmath167 .    the simplest way to build an inflationary model with @xmath137",
    "is hybrid inflation @xcite . in a hybrid scenario",
    ", the field evolves toward a minimum with nonzero vacuum energy .",
    "on such a potential , the inflationary solution asymptotes to @xmath168 as @xmath56 approaches the minimum of the potential , after an _ infinite _ amount of inflation @xcite .",
    "consequently , in these models inflation ends because of an instability in an orthogonal direction , induced by an auxiliary field .",
    "clearly , this scenario yields an arbitrarily large amount of inflation with an arbitrarily small field variation .",
    "such models are therefore well - behaved from the standpoint of effective field theory .",
    "it might be argued that hybrid inflation is fine - tuned , as it relies on having an auxiliary field with an instability exponentially close to the origin . in practice ,",
    "hybrid models exploit the presence of a hierarchy of mass - scales in nature , and so do not involve any _ extra _ tunings .    in the case of `` inverted '' potentials characteristic of spontaneous symmetry breaking , inflation ends dynamically when the slow roll parameter @xmath9 passes through unity , and no extra parameters are required to fix the endpoint of inflation . near the origin , the potential is dominated by the lowest order term in its taylor series , so we consider `` small - field '' models where @xmath169 .    without tuning or a symmetry , the inflaton mass term dominates , and @xmath170 . in this case",
    ", we derive an expression for the field variation over the entire inflationary period , eq  ( [ phirun ] ) , or @xmath171 .",
    "therefore as we approach the scale - invariant limit , @xmath172 , the field variation becomes large in planck units .",
    "interestingly , most of the field evolution happens near the _ end _ of inflation , long after observable perturbations have been generated .",
    "the field variation can be small during the first four e - folds of inflation , @xmath136 thereby nominally satisfying @xmath137 .",
    "the field variation is , however , _",
    "large _ during the last e - fold , @xmath138 therefore , such models still suffer from the `` last e - fold '' problem , and generically yield large field variations near the end of inflation .",
    "this behavior can be seen in the approximate flow relation @xmath173 valid when @xmath174 near the end of inflation , @xmath175 , and the field variation is generically of order @xmath1 , even for models which generate a negligible tensor amplitude on observable scales .",
    "this analytic result is consistent with conclusions based on a stochastic analysis using the flow equations , discussed here and in ref .",
    "whether or not a field variation @xmath176 is actually a problem is a model - dependent statement @xcite .",
    "one of us ( whk ) has argued that field variations of this magnitude are perfectly acceptable in the context of natural inflation @xcite .",
    "other models might incorporate such field variations in a natural way ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order for the field variation during inflation to be very small in planck units , the mass term for the inflaton must be suppressed .",
    "this might be accomplished by fine - tuning : for example a very flat potential with a sharp `` drop off '' , so the potential resembles a mesa rather than a rounded hilltop . in this case , a taylor expansion of the potential near the end of inflation is dominated by higher - order terms .",
    "( a similar tuning problem was identified in ref .",
    "@xcite using a counting argument on a generic dimensionless paremeter set . ) a less contrived alternative is to introduce a symmetry which forces the mass term to vanish , so that the potential is dominated by quartic ( or higher - order ) interactions during the inflationary period . in this case , @xmath9 varies rapidly near the end of inflation , and @xmath137 over the entire inflationary period , without the need for further tuning . in ref .",
    "@xcite whk and mahanthappa constructed a detailed model based on an explicitly broken local symmetry , demonstrating that one can achieve the desired suppression of the inflaton mass term within a realistic lagrangian .",
    "we argue that this model satisfies the `` challenge '' issued by boyle , steinhardt , and turok in ref .",
    "@xcite to construct a deterministic , complete inflationary model which is consistent with @xmath177 .",
    "the model is technically natural : no fine - tuning is required even when loop corrections are included , and the potential @xmath178 - \\ln\\left(g^2\\right)\\right\\rbrace \\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has a smooth minimum , bounded below .",
    "the inflaton can be coupled to fermionic degrees of freedom , allowing reheating , without spoiling the form of the inflationary potential .",
    "a discussion of how to achieve a similar suppression of the mass term in extra - dimensional theories can be found in ref .",
    "we therefore conclude that tuning arguments _ can not _ be used as suggested by boyle , _ et al . _ to place a lower - bound on the tensor / scalar ratio for inflation models .",
    "conversely , there is no watertight argument that can be used to rule out inflationary models with @xmath73 , and the value of @xmath5 will ultimately be determined observationally .",
    "however , the analysis here shows that in typical models of inflation , the variation in the field value during the last e - fold of inflation can be significantly larger than the change during the epoch in which cosmological perturbations are laid down .",
    "consequently , if one is considering a class of models for which @xmath179 is disfavored , the analysis here can be used to put tight constraints on the models parameter space .",
    "observationally , we are making rapid strides .",
    "forthcoming observations will be capable of detecting a tiny deviation from scale - invariance . in the absence of running , a blue spectrum , ( @xmath99 )",
    "will strongly favor hybrid - type inflation models .",
    "a red spectrum ( @xmath57 ) favors `` inverted '' potentials typical of small - field inflation .",
    "current upper bounds on the tensor amplitude are much weaker than the ultimate theoretical limits on their detectability . if tensor modes are detected by future measurements , we will acquire a wealth of phenomenological information about the inflationary epoch @xcite . if the tensor / scalar ratio turns out to be unobservably small , we can still learn much about inflation . however , despite recent progress , there is no guarantee that the theoretical questions surrounding the `` naturalness '' of inflation will be quickly resolved .",
