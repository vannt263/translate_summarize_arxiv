    "researchers in the field of complex networks agree that a change in the network topology induces a critical change in dynamics .",
    "pastor - satorras and vespignani first showed the absence of an epidemic threshold in a scale - free network@xcite , following which many researchers have focused on the dynamics on complex networks , such as synchronization@xcite , pattern formation@xcite , and other phenomena .    in this study , we focus on the bouchaud - mzard(bm ) model on a complex network@xcite .",
    "it is known that the wealth distribution in a real economy exhibits a power - law behavior , called pareto s law@xcite . with a view to this power law ,",
    "bouchaud and mzard proposed a model , given by the following stratonovich stochastic differential equation . @xmath1",
    "where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath4 represent the wealth of the @xmath5-th agent , number of agents , coupling between agents , and variation of noise , respectively . in this model , the evolution of the wealth is determined by two processes : exchange of wealth and a random multiplicative process , respectively described by the first and second term in the right - hand side of eq.([bm - original ] ) .",
    "bouchaud and mzard analyzed this model using the mean - field theory and calculated the probability density function(pdf ) of wealth .",
    "they showed that the stationary distribution of normalized wealth @xmath6 , where @xmath7 represents the average over all agents , exhibits the power - law behavior .",
    "they also found that `` wealth - condensation , '' which is indicated by the divergence of the variance of @xmath6 , occurs at @xmath8 .",
    "the divergence of the variance implies that wealth condenses to a few rich agents . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath9 , the variance remains finite , and the wealth of many agents is close to the average .    in the original bm model ,",
    "all agents are coupled with each other . however , in a real economy , agents can exchange their wealth with a limited number of agents .",
    "therefore , it is natural to extend the bm model on a complex network in which the number of neighbors is limited . some studies have already dealt with this subject . in their original study on the bm - model@xcite , bouchaud and mzard carried out numerical simulations on a regular random graph to estimate the exponent of the power - law behavior .",
    "they reported that the exponent obtained from numerical simulation becomes smaller than that obtained from mean - field theory .",
    "some studies have also reported on the simulation of this model on a barabsi - albert ( ba ) network and a watts - strogatz(ws ) network@xcite . in these studies , the authors discussed numerical simulation results , however , none of them proposed a quantitative theory that could explain these results .",
    "this study aims to develop a quantitative theory of the bm model on a random network .",
    "the key assumption of our theory is `` adiabatic and independent '' assumptions on the stationary distribution function , which is explained in a later section . by using these assumptions and the central limit theorem",

    "we compared our analytic results with those of the numerical simulation , and we found that our theory showed better agreement than did the mean - field theory .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , we define the model we investigate in this paper .",

    "we should make several comments on these results .",
    "first , this theory gives a distribution that does not obey the power - law behavior .",
    "eq.([total - dist - eq ] ) shows that the pdf @xmath36 is written with the integral of @xmath55 over @xmath33 . because @xmath38 is gaussian",
    ", @xmath36 does not exhibit the simple power - law behavior .",
    "the next important suggestion of this theory concerns the wealth - condensation transition . in our theory , @xmath44 diverges if @xmath56 , implying that the wealth - condensation occurs at this point . using @xmath57 , this leads to the conclusion that wealth condensation occurs at @xmath58 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean - field theory gives the divergence of the variance at @xmath59 .",
    "therefore the difference between our theory and the mean - field theory can be tested by estimating @xmath60 from the simulation .",
    "finally , we note that our theory can be applied only for the non - wealth - condensation phase .",
    "we need the central limit theorem to obtain @xmath38 , which is only applicable for the case in which the variance of @xmath31 is finite .",
    "we discuss this point in greater detail in the final section .      in this subsection",
    ", we extend the developed method for a regular random graph to a general random network .",
    "as in the case of a regular random network , we start from the mean - field theory . in this theory , we define @xmath61 as the pdf of @xmath31 on the node whose degree is @xmath16 . because this network is heterogeneous , the mean of @xmath31 may depend on @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , we need to define @xmath62 , the average of @xmath31 on nodes with degree @xmath16 , to perform the mean - field calculation .",
    "the mean - field fokker - planck equation is constructed in the same manner as in the case of the sis model or kuramoto oscillator@xcite , and we obtain @xmath63 +   \\sigma^2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left[x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } ( x\\rho_k(x , t))\\right]\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can simplify this equation by introducing the `` weighted '' average of @xmath31 as @xmath64 , which leads to @xmath65 +    \\sigma^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial    x}\\left[x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } ( x\\rho_k)\\right],\\ ] ] where we abbreviated @xmath61 as @xmath66 . as in the case of a regular random graph ,",

    "finally , @xmath71 is determined to satisfy the condition @xmath15 . from @xmath72",
    ", we obtain @xmath73 .",
    "now we follow the same procedure as that described in the previous subsection to calculate the pdf more accurately .",
    "we consider the pdf of the wealth on node @xmath5 , whose degree is @xmath16 . if the average of sums of @xmath31 in the neighborhood of node @xmath5 is given by @xmath33 , we find the conditional pdf of @xmath31 on node @xmath5 as @xmath74    using the adiabatic assumption explained in the previous subsection , we assume @xmath75    next , we approximate @xmath76 by gaussian using the independent assumption .",
    "one difference between the regular random graph and the random graph with arbitrary degree distribution lies in that we need to assume lindeberg s condition in this case .",
    "suppose that there are independent variables @xmath77 , whose mean and variance are @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively .",
    "then , the pdf of @xmath80 converges to the gaussian , whose mean and variance are @xmath81 and @xmath82 , for @xmath83 , if lindeberg s condition is satisfied@xcite .",
    "although @xmath84 is finite in our case , we can approximate @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a parameter that must be determined by the self - consistency condition .",
    "the final step is to obtain self - consistent equations for the mean and variance of @xmath87 . using @xmath88 and @xmath89 obtained from eqs.([generalrhop ] ) , ( [ generalrho ] ) and ( [ generalp ] ) , we respectively obtain @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the average and variance of @xmath31 on nodes with degree @xmath16 , as @xmath92 and @xmath93    a node with degree @xmath16 is connected to a node whose degree is @xmath94 with probability @xmath95 , and we obtain @xmath96 where @xmath97 represents the weighted average of the variance , @xmath98 from eqs.([111851_13apr12 ] ) and ( [ generals ] ) , we obtain @xmath99 inserting this equation into eq.([112117_13apr12 ] ) , we obtain @xmath100 which leads to our final result , @xmath101 eqs.([generalrhop ] ) , ( [ generalrho ] ) , ( [ generalp ] ) , ( [ generals ] ) , and ( [ generalu ] ) are the set of equations that determine the stationary pdf",
    ".    the most important difference between the mean - field theory and ours lies in that there is no effect of @xmath12 in the mean - field theory . in the mean - field theory ,",
    "the pdf on the node with degree @xmath16 given by eq.([091511_4apr12 ] ) does not depend on @xmath12 , which causes a curious behavior .",
    "suppose that we decrease @xmath0 from a large value to 0 . at @xmath102 ,",
    "the node with degree @xmath16 goes into the wealth - condensate phase , whereas nodes with a larger degree do not condensate .",
    "therefore , the mean - field theory predicts the coexistence of condensated and non - condensated nodes . in this theory ,",
    "low - degree nodes condensate at large @xmath0 , whereas high - degree nodes do not condensate until @xmath0 becomes sufficiently small .",
    "on the other hand , all pdfs with different degrees are connected through @xmath97 in our theory . in this theory , @xmath97 diverges when @xmath103 , which implies the divergence of all @xmath104 from eq.([generals ] ) . in our theory ,",
    "wealth - condensation occurs on all nodes simultaneously .    finally , we comment on the behavior of the bm model on a scale - free network .",
    "researchers in the field of complex networks may consider that a singular behavior occurs in a scale - free network upon the wealth - condensation transition , such as the divergence or disappearance of the transition point @xmath60 .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case .",
    "the main difference between our case and other models that show singularity , such as the sis - model or kuramoto transition , lies in that we impose the self - consistency condition on the variance of @xmath31 , and not on its average . as shown in eq.([generals ] ) , we divide the weighted average of the variance @xmath91 by @xmath16 to calculate @xmath105 .",
    "this eliminates the singular behavior that we often observe in the dynamics on a scale - free network .",
    "in this section , we test the analytic results obtained in the previous section by comparing them with numerical simulations .    because we have presented two analytic results , one for a regular random network and the other for a heterogeneous random network , we carried out the simulations for both networks . for the former , all nodes had the same degree , whereas for the latter , half of the nodes had degree 10 and the other half had degree 20 .",
    "we use these two models because it is easy to calculate the pdf in these models .",
    "however , the readers might find these models too artificial . to test our theory in a more realistic model ,",
    "we show the result of simulations on ba - network@xcite . here",
    "we note that the direct calculation of wealth distribution is rather hard because we must calculate integral in eq.([generalrho ] ) for many values of @xmath16 . in this paper",
    ", we investigate @xmath91 , the variation of @xmath31 at a node with degree @xmath16 to test our theory instead , because it is much easier to compute .    in the following simulation , we carried out numerical integration by the euler - maruyama algorithm to obtain the distribution of normalized wealth @xmath106 .      in this subsection",
    ", we show the simulation result for a regular random network and compare it with our theory .",
    "first we calculate the pdf of the normalized wealth from 10 simulation trials on networks that include 5000 nodes . in fig.[d10fig ] , we show the obtained pdf for the network with degree @xmath107 , @xmath108 and coupling @xmath109 , 0.4 , and 0.5 . for all @xmath0 , the distribution coincides well with our theory , indicated by the solid line .",
    "the pdf given by the mean - field theory , indicated by the dashed line , strongly underestimates the probability density at small @xmath106 . on the other hand ,",
    "our theory gives a slightly larger pdf than the simulation , although , it shows better agreement .",
    "here we investigate the temporal and spatial correlation of @xmath31 to test the `` adiabatic and independent '' assumptions used to derive eqs.([staticassume ] ) and ( [ total - dist - eq ] ) . in the right - hand side of fig.[173853_3aug12 ] , we plot the typical trajectory of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "because the model we study is described by stochastic differential equations , it is difficult to show that the change in @xmath112 is `` slower '' than that in @xmath2 , however , it seems that @xmath2 changes more quickly than @xmath30 .",
    "concerning the `` independent '' assumption , we show the scatter plot between @xmath31 and @xmath33 in the left - hand side of fig.[173853_3aug12 ] .",
    "although there exists a tendency for @xmath31 to increases as @xmath33 increases , it is not strong .",
    "the correlation between @xmath31 and @xmath33 calculated by the numerical simulation is 0.238 .",
    "therefore we conclude that the `` adiabatic '' `` independent '' assumptions are fairly good .    in fig .",
    "[ j05fig ] , we show the pdf at @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and 20 .",
    "it is clear that the discrepancy between our theory and the numerical simulation increases as @xmath16 decreases .",
    "this is not surprising , because the error caused by the application of the central limit theorem increases at small @xmath16 .",
    "however , our theory appears to be better than the mean - field theory , even in the worst case .",
    "for example , when @xmath116 , the probability density obtained by the mean - field theory is smaller than @xmath117 at @xmath118 , whereas the numerical simulation and our theory shows that it is @xmath119 . on the other hand , the difference from the result of numerical simulation at large @xmath31 is indistinguishable between our theory and mean - field theory .",
    "finally , we check the wealth - condensation transitions .",
    "though our theory does not exhibit the exact power - law behavior , it suggests that variance of normalized wealth diverges at @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , we can expect power law behavior @xmath121 for large @xmath31 at this point . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean - field approximation gives @xmath122 , and we can test our theory by estimating @xmath60 by checking the exponential tail . in fig.[variance ] we plot the exponent @xmath123 , @xmath124 at @xmath125 , estimated from the fitting of the pdf obtained through 100 simulation trials on a regular random graph @xmath126 , @xmath116 .",
    "it is clear that wealth - condensation occurs at @xmath127 , which is closer to the prediction of our theory @xmath128 , than that of the mean - field theory , @xmath129 .      in this section",

    "we use the central limit theorem to derive the equation for a stationary pdf ; however , this approach is not applicable when the variance of @xmath136 diverges . to treat the wealth - condensate phase ,",
    "we need a generalized central limit theorem that is applicable when the variance diverges .",
    "it is known that the pdf of the sum of independent identical random variables converges to a stable distribution function when the variance diverges@xcite .",
    "it would be possible to make the theory for the wealth - condensate phase on a regular random network using this theorem ; however , further work will be required toward this end . for a general random network ,",
    "the generalized central limit theorem unfortunately remains still insufficient . to treat such a network , we require a generalized central limit theorem for non - identical independent random variables , which has not been yet established .",
    "second , one might be interested in better approximating the the pdf . as shown in fig .",
    "[ j05fig ] , the pdf obtained by our method still has a large discrepancy with the numerical simulation , especially for nodes with small degree . to reduce these errors , we need to use the improved central limit theorem , which can deal with the rate of convergence . the application of chebyshev s rate - of - convergence theorem@xcite would lead to a better approximation .",
    "finally , we should comment on the `` adiabatic and independent '' assumptions .",
    "we have no proof to verify these assumptions ; however , the coincidence with the simulations suggests that these assumptions work very well .",
    "if so , the theory developed in this study will be applicable to other dynamical systems .",
    "the essential part of our theory is to impose the self - consistency condition on the average and variance of the dynamical variables on each node . in the case of the bm model",
    ", the self - consistency condition for the average is automatically satisfied , and we need only to calculate the variance .",
    "this procedure is very general , and it will be applicable to analyze other dynamical behaviors such as synchronization or diffusion .",
