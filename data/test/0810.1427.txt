    "in the last few years , an increasing number of astronomical observations ( such as data from cmb temperature fluctuations spectrum and supernova type ia redshift - distance surveys ) have indicated that current universe is almost flat and undergoing a positively accelerated phase of expansion [ 1 ] .",
    "this phenomenon is not predicted by standard cosmology governed by general relativity with the known matter constituents . to explain this cosmic positive acceleration ,",
    "mysterious dark energy has been proposed .",
    "there are several dark energy models which can be distinguished by , for instance , their equation of state ( eos ) @xmath4 during the evolution of the universe .",
    "the cosmological constant is the simplest model of dark energy with equation of state @xmath5 , but the huge fine - tuning required for its magnitude makes it unfavorable for the cosmologists .",
    "it is then tempting to find alternative models of dark energy which have dynamical nature unlike cosmological constant .",
    "an accelerated expansion can be realized by using a scalar field whose origin may be found in superstring or supergravity theories ; some of these models are quintessence , k - essence , tachyonic models , dilatonic models and phantom fields [ 2 ] ( see also [ 3 ] ) . other alternative approaches to accommodate dark energy are modification of general relativity by considering additional spatial dimensions [ 4 - 6 ] or modified einstein - hilbert action [ 7 ] .    in recent years , there has been a lot of interest in the extra dimensional theories by modifying the old kaluza - klien picture , where the extra dimensions must be sufficiently compact .",
    "these recent developments are based on the idea that ordinary matter and gauge fields could be confined to a three dimensional world ( brane ) , while gravity and possibly non - standard matter are free to propagate in the entire extra dimensional spacetime ( the bulk ) .",
    "one of the most popular braneworld models is the rundall - sundrom ii setup [ 5 ] . in this model conventional 4d gravity",
    "can be recovered at large scales ( low energies ) on a minkowski braneworld embedded in a @xmath6 anti de sitter ( ads ) bulk . on the other hand ,",
    "dvali - gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) introduced a braneworld model which gravity is modified at large distances rather than short distances in contrast to other popular braneworld scenarios , because of an induced four - dimensional ricci scalar in the action on the brane [ 6 ] .",
    "this term can be obtained by the quantum interaction between the matter confined on the brane and the bulk gravitons .",
    "the dgp braneworld scenario explains accelerated expansion of the universe via leakage of gravity to extra dimension without need to introduce a dark energy [ 8 ] .",
    "while the rs model produces ultra - violet ( uv ) modification to the general relativity , the dgp model leads to infra - red ( ir ) modification of gr .",
    "however , by considering the effect of an induced gravity term as a quantum correction in rs model , we have a combined model that called `` warped dgp braneworld '' in the literature [ 9 ] .",
    "this setup gives also a `` self - accelerating '' phase in the brane evolution .",
    "on the other hand , astrophysical data also indicate that @xmath7 lies in a very narrow strip close to @xmath8 .",
    "the case @xmath9 corresponds to the cosmological constant . for @xmath7 less than @xmath8 the phantom dark energy",
    "is observed , and for @xmath7 more than @xmath8 ( but less than@xmath10 ) the dark energy is described by quintessence . more ever , the analysis of the properties of dark energy from recent observational data mildly favor models of dark energy with @xmath7 crossing @xmath8 line in the near past .",
    "so , the phantom phase equation of state with @xmath11 is still mildly allowed by observations . in this case , the universe lives in its phantom phase which ends eventually at a future singularity ( big rip ) .",
    "there are also a lot of evidence all around of a dynamical equation of state , which has crossed the so called phantom divide line @xmath9 recently , at the value of red shift parameter @xmath12 [ 10 ] .",
    "most of dark energy models treat scalar field(s ) as dark component(s ) with a dynamical equation of state .",
    "currently scalar fields play crucial roles in modern cosmology . in the inflationary scenario",
    "they generate an exponential rate of evolution of the universe as well as density fluctuations due to vacuum energy .",
    "it seems that the presence of a non - minimal coupling ( nmc ) between scalar field and gravity is also necessary .",
    "there are many theoretical evidences that suggest incorporation of an explicit non - minimal coupling of scalar field and gravity in the action [ 11 ] .",
    "the nonzero non - minimal coupling arises from quantum corrections and it is required also by the renormalization of the corresponding field theory . amazingly , it has been proven that the phantom divide line crossing of dark energy described by a single minimally coupled scalar field with general lagrangian is even unstable with respect to the cosmological perturbations realized on the trajectories of the zero measure [ 12 ] .",
    "this fact has motivated a lot of attempts to realize crossing of the phantom divide line by equation of state parameter of scalar field as dark energy candidate in more complicated frameworks .",
    "one of these attempts is a hybrid model , composed of two scalar fields , quintessence and phantom , that usually dubbed as quintom model in literature [ 13 ] .",
    "a quintom model was initially proposed to obtain a model of dark energy with an eos parameter @xmath7 which satisfies @xmath13 in the past and @xmath14 at present . as we have emphasized ,",
    "this model is mildly favored by the current observational data fitting .",
    "thus , the quintom model is a dynamical scenario of dark energy with the property that its eos can smoothly cross over the cosmological constant barrier @xmath9 .",
    "recently , zhang and zhu have considered a minimally coupled scalar field on the dgp braneworld and realized crossing of the phantom divide line by considering two possible cases [ 14 ] : for ordinary scalar field ( quintessence ) eos of dark energy crosses from @xmath15 to @xmath16 in negative branch of dgp setup ( that is branch with @xmath17 ) and for phantom field eos of dark energy crosses from @xmath16 to @xmath15 in positive branch ( @xmath18 ) of dgp scenario . with these preliminaries , in this paper we investigate crossing of the phantom divide line by considering quintom field non - minimally coupled to induced gravity on a warped dgp brane . assuming a frw brane with induced gravity in the presence of a quintom field which is non - minimally coupled to the induced ricci scalar",
    ", we show that the crossing occurs in a suitable range of model parameters .",
    "it is surprising that in this case we have crossing of phantom divide in both positive and negative branches ( @xmath19 ) of the warped dgp brane .",
    "this phenomenon is depended on the choice of the sign of non - minimal coupling parameter .",
    "we start with the action of the warped dgp model as follows @xmath20 @xmath21+\\int_{brane}d^{4}x\\sqrt{-g}\\bigg[\\frac{1}{\\kappa_{5}^{2 } } k^{\\pm}+{\\cal{l}}_{brane}(g_{\\alpha\\beta},\\psi)\\bigg].\\ ] ] here @xmath22 is the action of the bulk , @xmath23 is the action of the brane and @xmath24 is the total action .",
    "@xmath25 with @xmath26 are coordinates in bulk while @xmath27 with @xmath28 are induced coordinates on the brane .",
    "@xmath29 is 5-dimensional gravitational constant .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are 5-dimensional ricci scalar and matter lagrangian respectively .",
    "@xmath32 is trace of extrinsic curvature on either side of the brane .",
    "@xmath33 is the effective 4-dimensional lagrangian .",
    "the action @xmath24 is actually a combination of randall - sundrum ii and dgp model . in other words ,",
    "an induced curvature term is appeared on the brane in randall - sundrum ii model , hence the name _ warped _",
    "dgp braneworld [ 9 ] .",
    "now consider the brane lagrangian as follows @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a mass parameter , @xmath36 is ricci scalar of the brane , @xmath37 is tension of the brane and @xmath38 is lagrangian of the other matters localized on the brane .",
    "assume that bulk contains only a cosmological constant , @xmath39 .",
    "with these choices , action ( 1 ) gives either a generalized dgp or a generalized rs ii model : it gives dgp model if @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and gives rs ii model if @xmath42 [ 9 ] . the generalized friedmann equation on the brane is as follows @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is corresponding to two possible branches of solutions ( two different embedding of the brane ) in this warped dgp model and @xmath45^{1/2}$ ] where @xmath46^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 is an integration constant and corresponding term in the generalized friedmann equation is called dark radiation term .",
    "we neglect dark radiation term in which follows . in this case ,",
    "generalized friedmann equation ( 4 ) takes the following form @xmath51,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the total energy density , including scalar fields and dust matter energy densities on the brane : @xmath53 and @xmath54 is given by , @xmath55 where the crossover radius is defined as @xmath56 .",
    "now we consider two scalar fields , one quintessence and the other phantom field both non - minimally coupled to induced gravity on the warped dgp brane .",
    "the action of this non - minimal quintom model is given by @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is a non - minimal coupling , @xmath36 is ricci scalar of the brane , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the normal ( quintessence ) and phantom field respectively and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are corresponding potentials . we have assumed a conformal coupling of the scalar fields and induced gravity and these fields play the role of quintom dark - energy component on the brane .",
    "variation of the action with respect to @xmath59 gives the equation of motion of the normal scalar field @xmath63 and variation of the action with respect to @xmath64 gives the equation of motion of phantom field @xmath65 the energy density and pressure of quintom are given by the following relation respectively @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xmath68 in which follows , by comparing the modified friedmann equation in the warped dgp braneworld with the standard friedmann equation , we deduce the equation of state of quintom field .",
    "this is reasonable since all observed features of dark energy are essentially derivable in general relativity [ 14,15 ] .",
    "the standard friedmann equation in four dimensions is written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the dust matter density , while @xmath71 is dark energy density .",
    "comparing this equation with equation ( 5 ) we find @xmath72 non - minimal coupling of the scalar fields and ricci curvature on the brane does nt break the validity of conservation of the scalar fields effective energy density @xmath73 since the dust matter obeys the continuity equation and the bianchi identity keeps valid , dark energy itself satisfies the continuity equation @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the pressure of the dark energy .",
    "the equation of state for the dark energy can be written as follows @xmath76 using equations ( 14 ) and ( 16 ) we find @xmath77 @xmath78.\\ ] ] there are three possible cases in this setup : if @xmath79 , we have a quintessence model ; if @xmath80 the model is phantom and if @xmath81 , the dark component is a cosmological constant .",
    "evidently , in this setup non - minimal coupling of scalar fields and induced gravity plays a crucial role supporting or preventing phantom divide line crossing . in this respect ,",
    "the differences between the minimal and non - minimal setups will be more clear if we write the explicit dynamics of equation of state parameter .",
    "on the other hand , the effect of warp factor which appears in the definition of @xmath71 , will be highlighted in forthcoming arguments .",
    "we choose the following exponential potential with motivation that this type of potential can be solved exactly in the standard model @xmath82 and @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath35 are constant .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath88 @xmath89\\ ] ] @xmath90\\bigg]\\ ] ] as a comparison , in the minimal case ( with @xmath91 ) and neglecting the warp effect , when we consider just a quintessence field and choosing the sign of @xmath92 to be negative , two remaining terms on the right hand side of equation ( 21 ) will have opposite signs and the eos parameter essentially crosses the phantom divide line [ 14 ] .",
    "however , in our non - minimal quintom model the situation is more complicated and it is not simple to conclude that there is crossing of the phantom divide line or not just by defining @xmath92 sign since non - minimal coupling itself plays a crucial role in this case .",
    "we consider @xmath93 ( the non - minimal coupling of scalar fields and induced gravity ) as a fine - tuning parameter in this setup .",
    "in which follows , we use some parameters like @xmath94 ( the value of energy density of dust matter over the critical density defined as @xmath95 ) , @xmath96 ( present value of kinetic energy density of the scalar field over the critical density ) , @xmath97 ( present value of the energy density of @xmath98 over the critical density ) and non - minimal coupling to calculate eos parameter , @xmath99 .",
    "if we change the values of these parameters in appropriate manner ( subjected to observational constraints ) , the redshift at which crossing of the phantom divide line occurs will change since it is a model dependent quantity in this respect .",
    "we explain further these behaviors of phantom divide line crossing in our forthcoming arguments and within a numerical scheme . for these numerical calculations",
    "we introduce a new parameter defined as @xmath100 and in all figures the behavior of @xmath7 is plotted versus @xmath101 . in this numerical calculations ,",
    "we need explicit form of @xmath102 ( or @xmath103 ) in terms of other quantities .",
    "for instance @xmath102 is given as follows @xmath104\\big(\\frac{b}{-2\\big(\\mu^{2}+\\xi(\\varphi^2+\\sigma^2)b\\big)}\\big ) } { 1+(\\varphi-\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\varphi})\\frac{6\\xi^2\\varphi\\dot{\\varphi } b}{\\mu^2+\\xi(\\varphi^2+\\sigma^2)b}}\\ ] ] @xmath105 \\frac{3\\xi\\varphi\\sigma b}{(\\mu^2+\\xi(\\varphi^2+\\sigma^2)b)}-3h(\\dot\\varphi-4\\xi\\varphi h)}{1+(\\varphi-\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\varphi})\\frac{6\\xi^2\\varphi\\dot{\\varphi}b}{\\mu^2+\\xi(\\varphi^2+\\sigma^2)b}}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath106 and @xmath107 and @xmath108 on the other hand , friedmann equation given by ( 5 ) now takes the following complicated form @xmath109h^2\\ ] ] @xmath110    where @xmath111 @xmath112 and @xmath113 equation ( 26 ) is a quadratic equation in terms of @xmath114 and in principle has four roots .",
    "we show these roots as @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "two of these roots , say , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are negative , excluded from observational ground .",
    "the other two roots , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , are positive and as we will show have the capability to account for phantom divide line crossing .",
    "since behaviors of these roots in treating phantom divide line crossing are very similar , in which follows we consider only one of these roots , say @xmath118 , and investigate its cosmological consequences .",
    "the effect of warp factor on the dynamics of these solutions will be discussed later . in table @xmath119 , we have obtained some reliable ranges of non - minimal coupling to have crossing of the phantom divide line in this setup .",
    "we have assumed the age of universe to be @xmath120 and with this choice the values of @xmath93 are constraint to the ranges shown in the table . on the other hand , observational data show that crossing of the phantom divide line is occurred in redshift @xmath121 ( though a model dependent value but suitable for our purposes ) so we have obtained the value of @xmath93 which is corresponding to this value in last column of the table .",
    "the results of numerical calculations are shown in figure @xmath119 for two branches of this dgp - inspired model and with different values of non - minimal coupling @xmath93 . in this analysis",
    "the best ranges of values for @xmath93 to have a reliable model in comparison with observational data are obtained .",
    "note that in all of our numerical calculations we have assumed @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath86 and @xmath125 , and also for investigating the effect of non - minimal coupling we have set @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "figure @xmath119 shows the crossing of phantom divide line obtains in both positive and negative branches of the dgp - inspired model .",
    "however , there is a difference between crossing behavior of these solutions . indeed , as it could be understood from the figures , for positive branch of the model there is crossing of the pdl ( from phantom phase @xmath16 to quintessence phase @xmath15 ) only for positive non - minimal coupling parameter .",
    "by contrast , the above result for negative branch of dgp model holds only for negative values of nmc parameter while eos of dark energy has transition from quintessence phase @xmath15 to phantom phase @xmath130 .",
    ".acceptable range of @xmath93 ( constraint by the age of the universe ) for @xmath118 ( a positive root of @xmath114 as given by equation ( 26 ) ) to have crossing of the phantom divide line .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure @xmath131 shows that in the positive branch of this dgp - inspired scenario , the eos of dark energy crosses the phantom divide line for all values of non - minimal coupling parameter .",
    "it is worth noticing that there is a very different behavior of such a crossing relative to existing literature ( for instance [ 14 ] ) . while the eos of dark energy crosses from below of cosmological line to its above for positive values of @xmath93 , with negative values of @xmath93 this phenomenon occurs from above cosmological constant line to its below .",
    "the figure also indicates that there is no crossing in the negative branch of this setup for any range of non - minimal coupling parameter .",
    "this result could be compared with the minimal case obtained by zhang and zhu [ 14 ] .",
    "in fact in their framework , for phantom field the eos of dark energy crosses from @xmath16 to @xmath15 in positive branch of dgp scenario .",
    "here the situation differs due to non - minimal coupling and warp effect .    in figure @xmath132",
    "we show the dynamics of deceleration parameter with a non - minimally coupled phantom field on the warped dgp brane .",
    "the result confirm that this parameter vanishes in sufficiently late times of the universe evolution .",
    "we also plotted the three - dimensional profile of eos parameter @xmath7 versus @xmath101 and @xmath133 .",
    "light - curves analysis of several hundreds type ia supernovae , wmap observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and other cmb - based experiments have shown that our universe is currently in a period of accelerated expansion .",
    "an alternative to explain this accelerated expansion is a multi - component dark energy with at least one non - canonical phantom field .",
    "the analysis of the properties of dark energy from recent observations mildly favor models where @xmath134 crosses the phantom divide line , @xmath9 in the near past . in this respect ,",
    "construction of theoretical frameworks with potential to describe positively accelerated expansion and crossing of phantom divide line by equation of state parameter is an interesting challenge . in this paper , we have constructed a quintom dark energy model on a warped dgp brane .",
    "we have investigated the crossing of the phantom divide line in this setup in three cases : first we have considered a combined scenario consist of two scalar fields as a realization of quintom model .",
    "this model is built on a unified treatment of an ordinary ( quintessence ) scalar field and a phantom field non - minimally coupled to the induced ricci scalar on the warped dgp brane . in this case",
    "we have realized that cosmological constant line crossing occurs in both branches of this dgp - inspired scenario with suitable values and signs of non - minimal coupling parameter,(@xmath93 ) . for positive values of @xmath93 , the eos parameter of dark energy crosses the phantom divide line in @xmath135 branch of the model from below of cosmological constant line ( phantom phase ) to its above ( quintessence phase ) .",
    "but , for negative values of @xmath93 , this crossing occurs in @xmath136 branch from above cosmological constant line ( quintessence phase ) to its below ( phantom phase ) .",
    "secondly , we have considered an ordinary scalar field ( quintessence ) non - minimally coupled to the induced gravity . in this case",
    "we have obtained crossing of the cosmological constant line in both dgp@xmath137 branches of the model .",
    "the crossing occurs for positive branch by positive ranges of @xmath93 and for negative branch by negative values of @xmath93 .",
    "we have compared our results with the results of a similar analysis with minimal scalar field on the ordinary dgp setup investigated by zhang and zhu [ 14 ] .",
    "they have considered an ordinary scalar field ( quintessence ) on the dgp brane and obtained a crossing of the phantom divide line from @xmath15 to @xmath16 only in negative branch of dgp scenario .",
    "consequently , by our analysis it can be concluded that the presence of non - minimal coupling of scalar field and induced ricci scalar on the warped dgp brane leads to a crossing behavior in both branches of this dgp - inspired scenario . and",
    "finally we have considered a phantom scalar field non - minimally coupled to the induced ricci scalar on the brane . in this case the eos parameter of dark energy crosses the phantom divide line only in positive branch of model and its behavior is sensitive to the sign of the non - minimal coupling parameter .",
    "indeed , the eos of dark energy crosses cosmological constant line from phantom phase to quintessence phase for positive @xmath93 ; with negative @xmath93 this phenomenon occurs reversely ( from quintessence to phantom phase ) . by comparing our results with the minimal case ( which for phantom field the eos of dark energy crosses from @xmath16 to @xmath15 in positive branch of dgp scenario ) , we see that in our model this crossing behavior can occur even in reverse direction depending on the sign of the non - minimal coupling parameter .",
