    "a ground penetrating radar ( gpr , hereafter ) is used for probing the underground by transmitting radio waves in the subsurface and recording the backscattered reflections .",
    "the interest in gpr is due to its ability to reveal buried objects non - invasively and detect non - metallic scatterers with increased sensitivity to dielectric contrast @xcite .",
    "this sensing technique is , therefore , attractive for several applications such as geophysics , archaeology , forensics , and defense ( see e.g. @xcite for some surveys ) . in this work ,",
    "our focus is detection of buried landmines .",
    "it is one of the most extensively investigated gpr applications due to its obvious security and humanitarian importance .",
    "mine detection gpr usually operates in l - band ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ghz ) with ultra - wideband ( uwb ) transmit signals that allow resolving small targets ( @xmath2-@xmath3 cm diameter ) at shallow depths ( @xmath4-@xmath5 cm ) @xcite . in such situations ,",
    "gpr target recognition suffers from signal distortion due to inhomogeneous soil clutter , surface roughness and antenna ringing .",
    "moreover , the constituting material of many models of landmines is largely plastic and has a very weak response to radar signals due to its low dielectric contrast with respect to the soil @xcite .",
    "a variety of signal processing algorithms have been proposed for detection of low metal - content landmines in realistic scenarios ; approaches based on feature extraction and classification are found to be the most effective ( see e.g. @xcite ) , yet false - alarm rates remain very high .",
    "further , a high - resolution gpr has long scan times thereby making the data acquisition by a portable instrument very cumbersome @xcite .    in order to reduce the scan time or number of measurements , an emerging trend in gpr research @xcite",
    "is to employ the recently proposed compressed sensing ( cs ) framework @xcite . in cs ,",
    "a signal can be reconstructed using a reduced number of samples w.r.t .",
    "the the nyquist rate requirements , provided the signal is sparse in some domain.however , unlike point scatterers , the mine echoes are spatially extended and the resulting gpr received signal is not sparse in conventional range - time and frequency domains @xcite .",
    "therefore , our immediate goal is to find an efficient sparse representation ( sr ) which accurately represents the scattering behaviors related to soil type and targets .",
    "this has been shown to improve the classifier performance in discriminating mines from clutter @xcite .    in sr ,",
    "the signal - of - interest is transformed to a domain where the signal can be expressed as a linear combination of only a few columns or _ atoms _ of the _ dictionary _ matrix @xcite . when it is inefficient to pre - define the dictionary to contain arbitrary basis ( e.g. fourier or wavelets ) , the usual resort is to _ learn _ the dictionary from previous measurements .",
    "dictionary learning ( dl ) techniques aim to create adapted dictionaries which provide the sparsest reconstruction for given training - sets , i.e. , a representation with a minimum number of constituting atoms .",
    "classical dl algorithms such as method of optimal directions ( mod ) @xcite and k - svd @xcite operate in batches - dealing with the entire training set in each iteration .",
    "although extremely successful , these methods are computationally demanding and not scalable to high - dimension training sets .",
    "an efficient alternative is the online dictionary learning ( odl ) algorithm @xcite that converges fast , processes small sets , and can infer the dictionary from large or time - varying training sets @xcite .",
    "improved dl methods can aid in better target identification and subsequent reduction in gpr measurements through cs - based design . to this end ,",
    "our work focuses on hitherto unexamined application of dl towards gpr - based landmine classification . only one previous study has employed dl ( k - svd ) using gpr signals @xcite , for identifying bedrock features .",
    "we propose employing odl and then use the coefficients of the resulting sparse vectors as input to a support vector machine ( svm ) classifier to distinguish mines from clutter .",
    "our comparison of odl and k - svd using real data from l - band gpr shows that odl enjoys distinct advantage in speed and low false - alarm rates .",
    "fast odl computations pave the way towards cognitive gpr operation , wherein the system uses previous measurements to optimize the processing performance and is capable of sequential sampling adaptation based on the learned dictionary @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the gpr system and the data sets . in section iii",
    ", we introduce our technique for gpr target identification , with particular focus on odl .",
    "section iv presents classification and reconstruction results using real radar data .",
    "we provide concluding remarks in section v.",
    "we used a commercial gpr system and carried out the field campaign at leibniz institute for applied geophysics ( liag ) , hannover ( germany ) @xcite .",
    "we now provide details for the system and data .      the gpr system ( see fig . [",
    "fig : gpr ] inset ) is an impulse radar with central frequency of 2 ghz.the frequency of the pulse repetition ( prf ) and the sampling of the receiver adc is of @xmath0 mhz .",
    "table [ tbl : techparams ] lists the salient technical parameters of the system .",
    "the scan rate of the system is @xmath6 m / s with sampling resolution of 1 cm towards the perpendicular broadside ( or x direction ) and @xmath7 cm towards the cross - beam ( y direction ) .",
    "the radar uses a @xmath8 @xmath9 cm dual bow - tie dipole antenna for both transmit ( tx ) and receive ( rx ) sealed in a metallic shielding and an internal absorber .",
    "the raw data consists of samples of complex envelope of the received signal .",
    "[ fig : gpr ]    .gpr parameters [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in this work , we proposed odl for sparse decomposition of gpr - based mine data .",
    "our results indicate near - real - time execution times using odl , high clutter rejection and improved classifier performance .",
    "these characteristics open interesting opportunities for future cognitive operation of gpr .",
    "for example , in a realistic landmine - clearance campaign , an operator could gather the training measurements over a safe area next to the contaminated site , hypothetically placing some buried landmine simulants over it in order to have a faithful representation of the soil / targets interaction beneath the surface .",
    "in other words , our work allows the operator to `` calibrate '' the acquisition by providing a good training set to learn the dictionary ."
