    "@xcite extended this work by using the redshift distribution of polarized background radio sources against which rm is observed .",
    "they found that the rms value of rms through filaments up to redshift @xmath4 would be @xmath5 .",
    "they also found that the second - order structure function ( sf ) has a nearly - flat profile in angular separations of @xmath6 , meaning that rms through filaments decorrelate on angles less than @xmath7 .",

    "the top - left panel of figure [ figure2 ] shows one - dimensional profiles of @xmath28 from the sun along the ngp and sgp . the electron density in the northern sky is smaller than that in the southern sky at low altitudes",
    "this is due to the presence of a local , hot bubble with @xmath33 , centered at @xmath34 in kpc @xcite .",
    "for the regular magnetic field , @xmath35 , we use combinations of the axi - symmetric spiral ( ass ) or bi - symmetric spiral ( bss ) field introduced by @xcite , the halo toroidal field of @xcite , and the halo poloidal fields of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the top panels of figure [ figure3 ] show one - dimensional profiles of the strength of the regular field , @xmath36 , and the line - of - sight ( los ) field strength , @xmath37 , from the sun along the galactic poles .",

    "we note that the dipole and quadrupole models are identical toward the ngp , but differ toward the sgp .",
    "the ds models tend to have larger @xmath36 than other models , since in other models the spiral and toroidal fields partly cancel each other .",
    "the spiral field dominates @xmath36 at @xmath38 , while the toroidal field dominates at @xmath39 . for the los field strength ,",
    "the field strength is @xmath40 if the poloidal field exists .",

    ", @xcite followed such an approach with a constant amplitude everywhere .",
    "@xcite and @xcite introduced an  ordered \" or  striated \" field component .",
    "these works successfully reproduced the galactic rm mainly toward low and mid - galactic latitudes .",
    "however , it is not clear whether such treatments are good enough for studies of the galactic rm toward high galactic latitudes , where the random components are the dominant contribution to the rm . and constant rms amplitudes for electron density fluctuations and turbulent magnetic field",
    "would not be justified for broad distributions of @xmath51 and @xmath57 toward high altitudes ( see figures [ figure2 ] and [ figure3 ] ) , since they depend on @xmath51 and @xmath57 ( see appendix ) .",
    "in addition , in turbulent flows , phases are not really random",
    ".    an alternative approach would be to use the random electron density given by the ne2001 model for the electron density fluctuations .",
    "but we would then need to model the turbulent magnetic field separately .",
    "we therefore do not adopt this approach .",
    "as in @xcite , we model the random components with mhd turbulence simulations in a closed box , as described below . in principle , if we performed full mhd simulations of the galaxy , we could reproduce the electron density fluctuations and the turbulent magnetic field as well as the regular components in the galactic disk and halo .",
    "but currently available computational resources do not allow a numerical resolution high enough to simultaneously reproduce both the large - scale global components and the small - scale turbulent components .",
    "we embed the data of mhd turbulence simulations in the galactic halo described by the global distributions of @xmath28 and @xmath35 of the previous subsection . for this purpose",
    ", we carried out three - dimensional simulations of driven , isothermal , compressible mhd turbulence without self - gravity , using a multi - dimensional mhd code based on the total variation diminishing ( tvd ) scheme @xcite .",
    "this is an mhd extension of the explicit , second - order finite - difference , upwinded , conservative scheme of @xcite for hydrodynamics .",
    "the version of the code used includes a flux constraining scheme that maintains @xmath62 up to the machine accuracy @xcite . in uniform , static medium with @xmath35 assumed to be along the @xmath63-direction , turbulence was driven by imposing a solenoidal forcing with perturbations drawn from a gaussian random field at wavenumbers around @xmath64 in fourier space .",
    "the amplitude of the forcing was fixed in such a way that turbulence saturates at preassigned mach numbers .",
    "simulations were done in a periodic computational box with @xmath65 grid zones .",
    "the size of the simulation box , @xmath66 , and the outer scale or the driving scale of turbulence , @xmath67 , were determined as follows .",
    "observations suggest that @xmath68 is on the order of @xmath69 and @xmath70 in spiral arms and in interarm regions , respectively @xcite .",
    "these are ascribed to stellar sources such as stellar winds and protostellar outflows , or supernova and superbubble explosions .",
    "@xcite adopted @xmath71 for studies of rm in low and mid - galactic latitudes ( @xmath68 is not defined in their approach ) . on the other hand , @xcite studied the em distribution estimated with the wisconsin @xmath47 mapper ( wham ) . using mhd turbulence simulations",
    ", they found that the em distribution depends on @xmath66 and @xmath68 ; larger @xmath66 and @xmath68 results in smaller ems .",
    "they argued that the histogram of the wham data on the warm ionized medium that includes high galactic latitude data could be reproduced with @xmath72 pc and @xmath73 pc . adopting the results of @xcite , we set @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the grid of @xmath65 uniform zones for the box of @xmath74 corresponds to the spatial resolution of @xmath69 .",
    "we note that this resolution is enough to resolve the characteristic scales of turbulence ; for instance , the most energy containing scale and the integral scale , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are sufficiently large compared to the spatial resolution .",
    "representative simulations were performed for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , in order to cover the ranges of @xmath51 and @xmath57 toward the ngp and sgp ( figures [ figure2 ] and [ figure3 ] ) .",
    "table 2 lists the simulations along with the rms values of density and magnetic field strength . for the case of @xmath80 at high galactic altitudes ( @xmath81  kpc , figure [ figure3 ] )",
    ", we use the data for @xmath82 . since the contribution from high altitudes to the integrated rm is at most several per cent",
    ", this approximation does not seriously affect our results .",
    "in turbulence simulations , @xmath46 saturates roughly in one flow - crossing time , @xmath83 @xcite . for the length scale of @xmath84 , the corresponding timescale of @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the rms flow speed of @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    "is sufficiently short compared to the age of the galaxy .",
    "we thus use the data at the saturation stage of turbulence .",
    "the data of simulations are stacked ( or piled up ) from the galactic mid - plane up to the outer edge of the ne2001 model , @xmath89 ( figure [ figure1 ] ) . in the stacking",
    ", we try to align the direction of the regular field in simulation data with that of the analytic model as follows . as we already noted , the regular field is dominated by the spiral field at @xmath38 and by the toroidal field at @xmath39 ( see figure [ figure3 ] ) . in each domain ,",
    "the regular field direction is close to either the @xmath90 or @xmath91 direction in our coordinate systems , except narrow transition regions with a width @xmath92 .",
    "we divide each of the northern and southern hemispheres into four blocks : @xmath93 where @xmath45 is in units of kpc .",
    "we calculate the average values of @xmath51 and @xmath57 in each block and seek the simulation of closest parameters .",
    "table 1 summarizes the direction of the regular magnetic field and the values of @xmath51 and @xmath57 adopted in each block .",
    "for example , in block 1 of adon15 , where 15 means @xmath53 , we choose the simulation with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and align the regular field with the @xmath90-direction .",
    "the stacked data are renormalized in such a way that we match the average electron density and magnetic field in the computational box with those of the regular components of section 2.1 .",
    "after the renormalization , each grid keeps the fluctuations based on mhd turbulence simulations .",
    "examples of profiles of the resulting electron density , magnetic field , and rm ( see section 2.3 ) from the sun along the ngp , including both the regular and random components , are shown in figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "it is apparent that fluctuations in the case with @xmath96 @xmath97 are larger than those for @xmath98 @xmath97 , as expected .",
    "the strength of the turbulent magnetic field ( @xmath99 ) is at most a few @xmath100 , and mostly @xmath101 .",
    "this seems to be smaller than the strength of the random field , a few to several @xmath100 , in the galactic disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but consistent with @xmath102 a few kpc from the galactic plane estimated by assuming equipartition between the thermal and nonthermal pressures @xcite , as well as with the recent estimates of @xmath103 and @xmath104 toward the ngp and sgp , respectively @xcite .",
    "the sign of los magnetic field changes several times .",

    "we check our model for the electron density distribution by comparing the resulting dm and em with observed values @xcite .",
    "dm , which is determined only by the global , regular component , is 22 and 25 @xmath107 toward the ngp and sgp , respectively , while the observed value is @xmath108 @xmath107 .",
    "we note that the ne2001 model , from which we get the regular component , was designed to reproduce observations including dm .",

    "our model also reproduces the overall distribution of em at @xmath112 presented by @xcite .",
    "details are given in the appendix .",
    "the rm toward a source outside the galaxy is defined as @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and the path length @xmath116 are in units of @xmath117 , @xmath100 , and pc , respectively .",
    "conventionally rm is positive when the los magnetic field points toward us , and @xmath118 is the maximum distance along the los up to the outer edge of our model space . in this paper , we calculate the rm only due to the gmf .",
    "we do not include other possible contributions , such as the rm due to the igmf , the intrinsic rm at sources , and observational errors .",
    "we discuss those in section 4 .",
    "we consider a square fov of @xmath26 with @xmath119 on a side centered on each of the galactic poles , which is comparable to the fovs of rm observations toward the ngp and sgp @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also consider a square fov of @xmath27 with @xmath120 on a side .",
    "the smaller fov is roughly that proposed for the dense aperture array of the ska @xcite .",
    "the smaller fov is also used to check the fov dependence of rm statistics . to see structures in angular separations of @xmath121 for which the second - order sf of observed rms is available @xcite",

    "the numbers of pixels we use are @xmath123 and @xmath124 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 fovs , respectively .",
    "we calculate rms with equation ( [ eq : rm ] ) assuming one extragalactic radio source in each pixel , and construct mock rm maps . for each map ,",
    "we randomly rotate stacked simulation boxes around the axis parallel to the regular magnetic field in table 1 ( keeping the direction of the regular magnetic field ) and randomly shift box centers to avoid the repeat of the same grid zones which would make artifacts in statistics .",
    "when the integration reaches the top of a simulation box , the integration proceeds into the next stacked box and the integration is continued .",
    "if the integration reaches the side of the simulation box , we apply the periodic boundary condition to the side , and replicate the box beyond the side .",
    "we obtain 200 mock maps for each model listed in table 1 and each fov , and calculate statistical quantities .",

    "the combined map due to the regular and random components ( third panel ) as well as the binned map of median rms in @xmath126 pixels ( rightmost panel ) are also shown .",
    "we can see that the regular components of density and magnetic field alone produce large - scale structures of up to the fov size .",
    "the structures highlight @xmath37 as induced by the radial and azimuthal components of the spiral and toroidal fields ( the model shown does not include a poloidal field ) .",
    "the random components of density and magnetic field , on the other hand , produce complex structures , such as clump - like and filament - like features , on angular scales of @xmath127 .",
    "such structures persist in the combined map .",
    "@xcite showed binned maps of median rms in @xmath126 pixels toward the ngp and sgp , which were produced from observational data .",
    "the maps display structures of a few to several degrees . in our model ,",
    "such structures are mostly the consequence of the random components of density and magnetic field ( rightmost panel ) .",
    "our results indicate that the random components mainly produce the observed rm structures on scales less than several degrees , while the regular components contribute to larger scale structures .",
    "we first examine the statistics of rms in maps due to the regular components alone .",
    "we calculated the average , @xmath128 , and the standard deviation , @xmath129 , in maps for the models and fovs we consider .",
    "the resulting values are shown in table 3 .",
    "the average is mainly determined by the existence of the poloidal component of the gmf ; @xmath130 without the poloidal component , or @xmath131 and @xmath132 toward the ngp and sgp , respectively , if the dipole poloidal component exists , and @xmath133 and @xmath134 toward the ngp and sgp , respectively , if the x - field poloidal component exists .",
    "the absolute values toward the ngp are a little smaller than those toward the sgp , due to the existence of a low density , local hot bubble centered in the northern sky ( figure [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the averages for the @xmath27 fov are slightly smaller than those for the @xmath26 fov , since the smaller fov includes high latitude regions only where the density and magnetic field strength are both smaller .",
    "the standard deviations are @xmath135 and @xmath136 toward the ngp and sgp , respectively , for the @xmath26 fov .",
    "these are caused mostly by contributions from the radial and azimuthal components of the gmf ( see also the leftmost panel of figure [ figure5 ] ) .",
    "the ds models tend to have larger standard deviations than the dn and qs models , because the ds models have larger @xmath36 at mid and high altitudes as noted in section 2.1 .",
    "larger values toward the sgp than those toward the ngp are again due to the existence of a local hot bubble near the sun .",
    "the standard deviations for the @xmath27 fov are smaller by a factor of @xmath137 than those for the @xmath26 fov , since the smaller fov includes a narrower range of rm values .",
    "we next examine the statistics of rms due to both the regular and random components .",
    "figure [ figure6 ] shows the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of rms in maps of @xmath26 fov , averaged over 200 rm maps , for all models we consider .",
    "the pdfs roughly follow the gaussian distribution , as pointed out by @xcite .",

    "the average and standard deviation of @xmath138 ( the average of rms for a map ) and @xmath139 ( the standard deviation of rms for a map ) over 200 maps were calculated .",
    "figure [ figure7 ] shows the resulting values for @xmath26 fov as well as for @xmath27 fov .",
    "the value of @xmath138 , which approximates the peak positions for the nearly - symmetric pdfs in figure [ figure6 ] , is determined mostly by the regular components .",
    "so the average of @xmath138 is close to @xmath138 of the regular components alone in section 3.1 ; @xmath140 @xmath141 , without the poloidal component of the gmf , or @xmath142 and @xmath143 toward the ngp and sgp , respectively , if the poloidal component exists . as noted in section 1 ,",
    "the medians of observed rms toward the ngp and sgp are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively @xcite .",

    "the fluctuation of @xmath138 over the 200 maps is rather small ; the standard deviations of @xmath138 for 200 maps are @xmath144 for models with @xmath145 and @xmath146 for models with @xmath147 , as shown with error bars in figure [ figure7 ] .",
    "these values are much smaller than the difference between the observed averages , @xmath148 @xmath141 , toward the ngp and sgp .",

    "the estimations of @xcite with their observed rms are @xmath155 and @xmath15 toward the ngp and sgp .",
    "so our estimations of @xmath139 with simulated rms are substantially smaller than the values of @xcite .",
    "we argue that all of our models fail to reproduce not only the peak positions but also the widths of the pdfs of observed rms toward the ngp and sgp ( see further discussions in sections 4 and 5 ) .    from figure [ figure7 ]",
    ", we see the average and standard deviation of @xmath138 are not sensitive to the size of fov .",
    "but the values of @xmath139 for the @xmath27 fov are somewhat smaller than those for the @xmath26 fov , as expected .",
    "we also calculated the two - dimensional power spectrum ( ps ) and structure function ( sf ) with the sky map of rm .",

    "figure [ figure8 ] shows the ps of rms due to both the regular and random components in maps of @xmath26 fov , averaged over 200 rm maps , for all models we consider .",
    "the ps toward the sgp are larger than those toward the ngp .",
    "this is again attributed to the presence of a local hot bubble in the northern sky . toward the sgp ,",

    "in our models , the average or median of the rm toward high galactic latitudes , @xmath138 , is determined mostly by the halo poloidal component of the gmf , while the standard deviation , @xmath139 , is determined mostly by the random component of the gmf .",

    "the fluctuation ( standard deviation ) of @xmath138 in simulations , @xmath146 , is too small to account for the difference between the observed medians toward the ngp and sgp . to see whether larger fluctuations of @xmath138 are possible with different model parameters , simulations with larger values of @xmath68 and @xmath46 were carried out ( not shown ) .",
    "we found that the fluctuation of @xmath138 increases with increasing @xmath68 and becomes @xmath187 for @xmath188 .",
    "however , with such large value of @xmath68 , the em distribution estimated from wham data @xcite can not be explained ( see appendix ) .",
    "the fluctuation of @xmath138 increases with increasing @xmath46 also .",
    "we find a sufficiently large fluctuation for @xmath189 , which corresponds to @xmath190 .",
    "but such large @xmath51 is clearly inconsistent with the value constrained from the em distribution @xcite and from polarization gradients @xcite .",

    "( note that the data of @xcite and @xcite are different . )",
    "we would get @xmath194 if we adopt @xmath195 .",
    "but again such a value is too large to explain the observed em distribution .",
    "we could explain the observed medians and standard deviations if there are additional global or local structures not represented in our models for the gmf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such structures could have been produced , for instance , by the parker instability or supernova explosions .",
    "in addition , @xcite have shown that transient structures can be produced in three - dimensional mhd simulations of turbulent gaseous disks .",
    "we could also address the discrepancy between the simulations and the data if the regular field is stronger than that in our models .",
    "for instance , we would have simulated the observed @xmath139 s , if the regular field strength was increased by a factor of @xmath137 .",
    "but then , the corresponding regular field strength near the galactic plane would be @xmath196 ( see figure  [ figure3 ] ) , which is larger than that adopted in recent observational studies @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , after investigating rms toward the perseus arm region , @xcite argued that observed rms are consistent with a toroidal field of strength @xmath102 toward the north , but @xmath197 toward the south ( note that the observation covers a rather thin region of @xmath198 and @xmath199 ) .",
    "this indicates that there may be room for additional modeling of the gmf , which we leave for future studies .    even with additional structures and stronger regular fields , however , the observed sfs are difficult to reproduce @xcite",
    ". the second - order sfs of simulated rms are substantially smaller than the observed sfs , especially at small angular separations of @xmath200 .",
    "this means that we need structures that would provide significant powers on scales of a parsec or so , but there is no observational support for such structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the slope of observed sfs , @xmath201 @xcite , is much flatter than that of simulated sfs , @xmath202 .",
    "we note that two - dimensional , white noise results in a flat sf ; @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the standard deviation of the noise .",
    "we would get @xmath205 for @xmath206 .",
    "observational errors should follow the distribution of white noise .",
    "but @xcite estimated that the observational errors in their data are @xmath4 and @xmath207 toward the ngp and sgp , respectively .",
    "@xcite estimated that the error in their data is @xmath208 .",
    "so observational errors may not be enough to explain the observed flat sfs of @xmath209 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it is expected that radio sources against which rms are observed have their own intrinsic rms .",
    "the rms of radio sources should also follow the distribution of white noise and contribute to a flat sf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that the observed sf toward the ngp deviates from a flat behavior at very small scales ; the square value of rm difference between two sources at @xmath210 and @xmath211 , @xmath212 ( not the second - order sf ) , is around @xmath170 at angular separations of @xmath213 .",
    "this tells us that even if the square value is solely due to the rms of radio sources , it is unlikely that the rms make up the observed flat sfs of @xmath209 .",
    "in fact , @xcite claimed that many observed sources possess little intrinsic rm from the fact that the fractional polarization percentage is nearly constant with increasing wavelength .",
    "finally , there exists clear evidences for an extragalactic component to the rms , from three different papers taking different approaches @xcite .",
    "although @xcite and @xcite attribute the excess scatter in rm to individual intervening absorbers along the line of sight , an alternative origin which can contribute to the observed rm toward high galactic latitudes too is the igmf .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 , using simulations for the large - scale structure formation in the universe , @xcite predicted that the rm due to the igmf would have @xmath214 and @xmath215 several @xmath141 .",
    "they also predicted that the sf of the rm has a flat profile of @xmath216 amplitude at angular separations larger than @xmath217 ; the sf is expected to decrease to the order of @xmath170 at @xmath213 from @xmath218 at @xmath219 , consistent with the observation of @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite suggests the possibility that a substantial fraction of the rm toward the ngp and sgp can be attributed to the rm due to the igmf .",
    "if so , the observed standard deviations and sfs can be explained . but",
    "reproducing the observed medians of rm still needs additional components or / and structures of the gmf .",
    "we have studied the galactic rm toward high galactic latitudes .",
    "we have considered a number of models for the global , regular components of the gmf and the electron density in the galaxy , based on observations .",
    "the turbulent , random components were modeled with three - dimensional mhd turbulence simulations .",
    "the strength of the regular magnetic field in our models is a few @xmath138 g close to the disk and smaller at high altitudes .",
    "the strength of the turbulent field is at most a few @xmath100 , and mostly @xmath101 . we obtained rm maps for @xmath26 fov toward the galactic poles , and compared the results with observations .",
    "we also considered a smaller fov of @xmath27 , designed to simulate the fov of future surveys with the ska .",
    "our models fail to simultaneously reproduce the observed medians of rms toward the ngp and sgp .",
    "the observations require vertical magnetic fields of @xmath220 toward the ngp and @xmath221 toward the sgp in the earth s vicinity , but such field geometries are not accommodated in the gmf models we considered .",
    "the pdfs of simulated rms are narrower and more sharply peaked than the observed pdfs , meaning that the standard deviations of simulated rms are smaller than the observed values .",
    "the second - order sfs of simulated rms are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the observed sfs at small angular separations .",
    "in addition , the slopes of the sfs of simulated rms are substantially larger than the observed ones .",
    "we argue that observational errors and the intrinsic rm of background radio sources are not enough to explain the discrepancies between the statistics of our simulated rms and observed rms .",
    "we suggest that the rm due to the igmf may account for a fraction of the rm toward high galactic latitudes and could explain the discrepancies in the standard deviation and sf of the rms . as a subsequent project",
    ", the rm due to the igmf as well as observational errors and the intrinsic rm of background radio sources would be incorporated in the modeling of the rm toward high galactic latitudes , to check quantitatively whether some of the discrepancies , such as those in the standard deviation and sf , would be explained .",
    "but we expect that reproducing the observed medians will still need additional components or / and structures of the gmf .",
    "we should note , however , that current observations of rms still contain large uncertainties .",
    "new and the future observational facilities such as the jvla , mwa , lofar , askap , meerkat , and the ska will produce much better data .",
    "for instance , askap will detect radio sources with average angular separations of @xmath219 .",
    "with such a dense rm grid , the quality of the observed rm data will be dramatically improved .",
    "better quality data will hopefully enable us to better quantify the contributions due to the gmf , the igmf , the intrinsic rm of background radio sources , and observational errors .",
    "finally , we note that better measurements of the mach number of turbulence in the halo by observations of @xmath222 line profiles @xcite as well as by radio polarization gradients @xcite will help us improve the constraints on the magnitude and structures of the rm toward high galactic latitudes .",
