    "in an interesting saga of papers , dvali , gmez and others@xcite have put forward an intriguing suggestion : black holes ( bh ) could be understood as bose - einstein condensates of gravitons .",
    "if this view is correct , this would reveal a deep quantum nature of such fascinating objects and could lead to an alternative understanding of some of the most striking features of bh ; for instance , hawking radiation @xcite could be understood as being due to evaporation ( leakage as the authors put it ) of the condensate . besides , this picture brings new ideas about the bekenstein entropy @xcite , the absence of hair @xcite , as well as the quantum nature of information storage and the possible information loss in bhs @xcite .",
    "the main point of these works is that the physics of bh can be understood in this picture in terms of a single number @xmath0 , the number of gravitons contained in the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "these condensed gravitons have a wave length @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the planck length ; they have a characteristic interaction strength @xmath3 ( reminiscent of meson interactions in large @xmath4 gauge theories ) and the leakage leads to a hawking temperature of order @xmath5 , equal to the inverse of @xmath6 .",
    "the mass of the bh is @xmath7 and its schwarzschild radius therefore is given by @xmath8 , thus agreeing with the compton wavelength of the quantum gravitons @xmath6 , in accordance with the uncertainty principle that dictates @xmath9 in the ground state of the quantum system .",
    "therefore , up to various factors of the planck mass everything is governed by @xmath0 , the number of intervening gravitons .",
    "modulo some assumptions , all these results stem from the basic relation ( unless otherwise stated we work in units where @xmath10 ) @xmath11 that relates the number of gravitons @xmath0 , the mass of the gravitating object @xmath12 and its gravitational radius @xmath13 . for a schwarzschild bh @xmath14 .",
    "we found these results intriguing and we set up to try to understand them in a different language and , if possible , attempt to be more quantitative . on the process",
    "we have separated slightly from the original line of thought of the authors .",
    "the original approach of @xcite is not geometric at all .",
    "there is no mention of horizon or metric . here",
    "we will adopt a more conservative approach",
    ". we will assume the pre - existence of a classical gravitational field created by an unspecified source that generates the schwarzschild metric .",
    "as it is known , nothing can classically escape from a bh so if we wish to interpret this in potential terms ( which of course is not correct but serves us for the purpose of creating a picture of the phenomenon ) it would correspond to a confining potential . on and above this classical potential one can envisage a number of quantum fields being trapped .",
    "for sure there is a gravity quantum field present ; hence gravitons ( longitudinal gravitons that is ) . continuing with our semi - classical analogy ,",
    "these gravitons have had a long time to thermalize and it is therefore expected that they can form a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "of course , one may argue at once that gravitons do not have repulsive interactions , at least naively , and that therefore a bec is impossible to sustain .",
    "to this objection one could reply in a twofold way .",
    "first , it is up to the equations to determine whether such a condensate is possible or not ( we will see below that indeed it is , at least in the case of vanishing angular momentum ) . secondly one might also answer that in theories of emergent gravity , the ultimate nature of gravitons may be some type of fermionic degrees of freedom ( such as e.g. in the model suggested in @xcite ) .",
    "then , repulsion is assured at some scale .",
    "therefore we will try to identify a consistent set of equations describing a bec constructed on top of this classical field .",
    "we will see that remarkably enough the characteristics of the bec are uniquely described in terms of the schwarzschild radius of the bh and the value of a dimensionless parameter , interpreted as a chemical potential .",
    "a condensate appears not only to be possible but actually intimately related to the classical field that sustains it that determines its characteristics .",
    "it is therefore tempting to go one step beyond and reverse the order of the logical implication and eventually attempt to derive the classical field as a sort of mean field potential  la hartree - fock .",
    "however we will stop short of doing so here .",
    "in the subsequent we present the results of our investigations .",
    "in what follows we shall adhere to the following notational conventions : @xmath15 will be the einstein tensor : @xmath16 , where the ricci tensor and scalar curvature are constructed with the metric @xmath17 in the usual way .",
    "we will denote by @xmath18 the background metric that in our case it will invariably be the schwarzschild metric .",
    "perturbations above this background metric will be denoted by @xmath19 , so @xmath20 .",
    "we will use the minkowskian metric convention @xmath21 .",
    "we will leave for later discussion whether the indices of @xmath19 have to be raised or lowered with the background metric @xmath18 or the full one @xmath17 . likewise for the corresponding volume element ( @xmath22 versus @xmath23 ) . as we will see the results depend to some extent on the prescription that is chosen .    to initiate our program we should ,",
    "first of all , identify an equation ( or set of equations ) that could provide a suitable description of a bec in the present context .",
    "in other words , we have to find the appropriate generalization of the gross - pitaevskii equation to this case .",
    "the graviton condensate has necessarily to be described by a tensor field that in our philosophy has to be considered as a perturbation of the classical metric .",
    "only spherically symmetric perturbations will be considered to keep things as simple as possible .",
    "as we will see , every dimensionful quantity can be expressed as a function of the schwarzschild radius @xmath24 .",
    "let us consider a spherically symmetric perturbation on the schwarzschild metric ; that is we want to consider a quantum state a condensate having @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath26 we will now expand the perturbed einstein tensor up to second order in @xmath27 .",
    "this will allow us to retain the leading non - linearities .",
    "four of the components of the einstein tensor are non - null but only three are linearly independent ; both angular components coincide when using the form @xmath28 for the einstein tensor .    taking into account",
    "that @xmath29 , we have @xmath30 and analogous equations for the radial and angular components ( they are given in appendix [ einec ] ) .    it is well known that birkhoff s theorem @xcite guarantees that any spherically symmetric solution of the vacuum field equations must be static and asymptotically flat .",
    "so this means that the solution of the equations @xmath31 with @xmath18 being the schwarzschild s metric , must necessarily be of the schwarzschild type again . in conclusion",
    ", a perturbation of a schwarzschild metric in vacuum must end in another schwarzschild metric but taking into account a change in the parameters responsible of inducing the perturbation . stating this in other words , a spherically symmetric gravitational field should be produced by some massive object at the origin characterized by the schwarzschild radius , hence a perturbation in itself it",
    "can only be produced by an alteration of this radius and therefore a change in its mass .",
    "indeed , imposing the following ansatz for the components of the perturbation @xmath32 and substituting @xmath33 in ( [ gtt schw ] ) is possible to obtain the coefficients for each term of the radial expansion .",
    "we obtain @xmath34 & + \\frac{14a^5 + 25r_sa^4 + 20r_s^2a^3 + 10r_s^3a^2 + 5r_s^4a}{r^5}+ ... \\,,\\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath36 is a solution as implies no perturbation of the metric at all .",
    "but if @xmath37 the rest of the coefficients of the expansion are fixed once @xmath38 is given .",
    "the same happens for @xmath39 using the radial equation ( [ grr schw ] ) given in appendix [ einec ] .",
    "@xmath40 taking into account the accuracy of the expansion in @xmath27 the components of the metric become @xmath41 @xmath42 being the new mass associated to the bh and @xmath43 the perturbed schwarzschild radius .",
    "now we will use similar techniques in the ` quantum ' case and as we will see the results are dramatically different .",
    "however it is interesting to note that any perturbation @xmath27",
    "( i.e. each ` graviton ' ) has associated a certain amount of energy that is reflected in a change of the bh mass .      perturbing the metric as @xmath44 ,",
    "a completely covariant perturbative expansion for @xmath27 is obtained . by construction",
    "these equations are non - linear ( we keep only the leading non - linearities , to keep the formalism simple and analytically tractable as we will see later ) .",
    "we note that the usual gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite employed to describe bose - einstein condensates is a non - linear schrdinger equation ; i.e. an equation of motion that contains self - interactions ( hence the non - linearity ) , a confining potential for the atoms or particles constituting the condensate , and a chemical potential that is conjugate to the number of particles or atoms contained in the condensate .    among all these ingredients ,",
    "the perturbed einstein equations already contain most of them .",
    "they are already non - linear and while there is no confining potential explicitly included ( as befits a relativistic theory ) they do confine particles , at least classically , because if the selected background corresponds to a schwarzschild bh , the strong gravitational field classically traps particles inside the horizon .",
    "however , there is one ingredient still missing , namely the equivalent of the chemical potential .",
    "therefore we have to extend the formulation of perturbations around a classical bh solution to the grand - canonical ensemble by adding to the appropriate action a chemical potential term such as @xmath45 that is conjugate the quantity @xmath46 , which should be related to the graviton density of the condensate inside a differential volume element @xmath47 . taking into account that @xmath48 is not directly interacting with the background , but a field that propagates over the background",
    ", it may seem reasonable to take the volume element as the one corresponding to the background . still , the new term is completely covariant as can be seen in appendix [ scovariant ] .",
    "irrespective of this chemical potential term an appropriate action has to be chosen for the field @xmath19 .",
    "it is only natural to select the einstein - hilbert action expanded around the classical schwarzschild background @xmath18 to describe fluctuations of the metric in a reparametrization invariant way .",
    "one can then expand the einstein - hilbert lagrangian @xmath49 , with @xmath50 in powers of @xmath27 up to the desired order ( where @xmath51 is the planck mass ) . measure associated to the full",
    "metric has to be taken ( i.e. @xmath52 ) however this is not the only possibility to obtain diff - invariant equations ; for instance @xmath53 also could yield a covariant set of equations . ]",
    "an oddity of eq .",
    "( [ fullaction ] ) is that , as defined , @xmath54 has dimensions of [ energy]@xmath55 .",
    "this is because the field @xmath27 does not have the canonical dimension ; the field that has canonical dimensions is @xmath56 . after scaling the two powers of @xmath57 ,",
    "the chemical potential would have dimensions of [ energy]@xmath58 .",
    "still , these are not quite the correct dimensions for a chemical potential",
    ". as we shall see below the ` natural ' quantity to be identified with a chemical potential will in fact be the dimensionless combination @xmath59 that will be conjugate to @xmath0 , the number of gravitons in the bec condensate with @xmath60 .",
    "note that we assume that the chemical potential is @xmath61-dependent .",
    "the actual equations of motion derived from the previous action may take slightly different forms depending on the choice of volume elements .",
    "for the time being , let us take the simplest possibility @xmath62 where indices are assumed to be raised with the background metric only .",
    "actually eq .",
    "( [ eeq ] ) can be derived from the action we have chosen only if we neglect terms of the form @xmath63 .",
    "we will return to this point later .",
    "it is important to keep in mind the following : in the chemical potential part @xmath54 is considered in the grand canonical ensemble ; this implies that this magnitude is an external field and does not vary in the action ; in particular , for these equations of motion , it is independent of @xmath27 , so @xmath64 . under these considerations",
    "this term resembles the chemical potential term of the gross - pitaevskii equation",
    ".    this should be the way of introducing the chemical potential .",
    "otherwise , were @xmath65 not an external field , it would be necessary to take it into account when performing variations to derive the equations of motion .",
    "an equation of motion would be obtained for @xmath54 and this equation would nullify automatically the perturbation as well as the chemical potential itself , i.e. @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the external field @xmath54 is introduced in the theory as some kind of lagrange multiplier .",
    "as lagrange multipliers have constraint equations , the chemical potential of the theory may not be arbitrary at all .",
    "it must satisfy binding conditions with @xmath27 .",
    "the main difference is that this constrains are implicit in a gr theory .",
    "the restriction of @xmath54 is through the general covariance conditions for the action .",
    "in other words , the diffeomorphism covariance implies the covariant conservation of the einstein tensor , and this in itself entails the same for the chemical potential term , @xmath68 this differential equation of motion for the latter potential is valid up to every order in perturbation theory .",
    "hereinafter , we will proceed to find acceptable solutions of these equations and interpret them .",
    "we will separate the possible solutions into two regions : outside and inside the bh horizon .",
    "we certainly expect that the graviton condensate will disappear quickly in the outside region as @xmath69 and , imposing this as a boundary condition , we will see that in fact the condensate is identically zero on this side of the horizon .",
    "on the contrary , a unique non - trivial solution will be found in the interior of the bh .",
    "in this section it will be shown that even after the inclusion of @xmath70 there is not other normalizable solution outside the black hole horizon than the trivial solution for the perturbation previously discussed .      in the limit @xmath71",
    ", one needs only to keep the terms that are dominant in the einstein equations ( [ gtt schw ] ) , ( [ grr schw ] ) and ( [ gthth schw ] ) .",
    "then the equations ( [ eeq ] ) associated to @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 in this limit are , respectively will be neglected as we are interested in the simplest approximation to a gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the form of these terms depends on which convention is chosen for the volume element and to raise / lower indices . ]",

    "it has a constant value inside the bh and it appears to be exactly zero outside .",

    "let us now for a moment forget about the geometrical interpretation of bh physics and let us treat the problem as a collective many body phenomenon .",

    "however we shall refrain of dwelling on this any further at this point .     in solid line and the dimensionless @xmath125 in dashed line , across the horizon of the bh ( dotted line ) .",

    "but is that condensate really present ?",
    "our results do not answer that question , but if we reflect on the case where the limit @xmath212 is taken , without disturbing the bh geometry ( i.e. keeping @xmath101 constant ) this requires taking @xmath213 in a way that the ratio @xmath214 is fixed",
    ". then one gets @xmath128 .",
    "this value appears to be universal and independent of any hypothesis .",
    "the metric is 100% schwarzschild everywhere .",
    "we conclude that a bh produces necessarily a ( trapping ) non - zero chemical potential when the physical system is expressed in terms of the grand - canonical ensemble . outside the bh , @xmath111 .",
    "another way of reaching this conclusion is by taking a closer look to our exact equations in the previous section . if one sets @xmath111 then necessarily @xmath177 and one gets the classical schwarzschild solution everywhere , but the reverse is not true .",
    "one can have @xmath177 but this does not imply @xmath111 .",
    "let us emphasize that these results go beyond the second order perturbative expansion used in parts of this article .",
    "as gravitons cross the horizon and are trapped by the bh classical gravitational field they eventually thermalize and form a bec . the eventual energy surplus generated in this process",
    "is used to increase the mass and therefore the schwarzschild radius of the bh .",
    "@xmath174 is now non - zero ; it is directly proportional to @xmath215 , the number of gravitons , and the chemical potential departs from the value @xmath128 , presumably increasing it .",
    "as soon as @xmath216 the metric inside the bh is not anymore schwarzschild ( but continues to be schwarzschild outside ) .",
    "note that the metric is destabilized and becomes singular for @xmath217 , so surely this is an upper limit .    yet",
    "another possible interpretation , that we disfavour , could be the following . each bh has associated a given constant value of @xmath125 , hence of @xmath174 . then eqs . ( [ mistery ] ) would imply that after the emission of each graviton , the value of @xmath101 is readjusted .",
    "the problem with this interpretation is that it would require a new dimensionless magnitude ( @xmath125 ) to characterize a schwarzschild bh ; something that most bh practitioners would probably find hard to accept . in either case",
    "the metric in the bh interior is different from the schwarzschild one .",
    "we shall now conclude . the purpose of this work was to have some insights in the reformulation of a quantum theory of black holes in the language of condensed matter physics .",
    "the key point of the theory is to identify the black hole with a bose - einstein condensate of gravitons .",
    "we have conjectured the set of equations that play the role of the gross - pitaevskii non - linear equation ; they are derived from the einstein - hilbert lagrangian after adding a chemical potential - like term .",
    "we have used a number of different techniques to analyze these equations when the perturbation ( i.e. the tentative condensate ) has spherical symmetry .",
    "the equations appear at first sight rather intractable , but by doing a perturbative analysis around the bh schwarzschild metric at quadratic order ( i.e. including the leading non - linearities ) we found that the chemical potential necessarily vanishes in the exterior of the bh . on the contrary , in the interior",
    "we have found two set of solutions , one of them has to be discarded as producing a non - normalizable result .",
    "the other one leads to a non - zero chemical potential in the interior of the bh that behaves as @xmath218 .",
    "there is a finite jump of the chemical potential at the bh horizon .",
    "surprisingly or maybe not so this solution modifies the coefficient of the @xmath219 and @xmath220 terms in the schwarzschild solution , but not its functional form .",
    "of course if there is no chemical potential at all , the modification vanishes , in accordance with well known theorems .",
    "however , if the former is non zero , the modification is also necessarily non - zero . from the existence and knowledge of this solution , most relations obtained in @xcite can be rederived .",
    "we have seen that there is some ambiguity in the way the effect of the background metric is taken into account and probably more work is needed to produce a unique fully convincing answer .",
    "these ambiguities get reflected in the relation between the number of gravitons and the schwarzschild radius , where the value of the ( constant ) condensate enters .",
    "the relation between the number of gravitons and the geometric properties of the bh involve an a priori independent and tuneable parameter , the dimensionless chemical potential @xmath125 ( related to the mean - field wave function of the condensate @xmath174 ) .",
    "we find this somewhat strange as this would be a new black hole parameter .",
    "therefore we favour the universal value @xmath128 as discussed in the text .",
    "as should be obvious to the reader who has followed our discussion , our approach is somewhat different from the one developed in the initial papers by dvali , gmez and coworkers .",
    "we assume from the start the existence of a classical geometry background that acts as confining potential for the condensate .",
    "the fact that the functional form of the metric perturbation induced by the condensate is exactly the same as the original background , of course gives a lot of credence to the possibility of deriving the latter from the former in a sort of self - consistent derivation .",
    "we have not explored this possibility in detail yet .",
    "it is quite plausible that one could entertain the presence of condensates of other quantum fields inside the bh horizon ( why only gravitons ? ) . while we do not expect much of a conceptual difference",
