    "a lifetime - limited linewidth implies a negligible rate of exciton dephasing in the qd . in turn , this opens the possibility of generating single photons by coherent rayleigh scattering .",
    "the resonance fluorescence can be divided into a coherent part , the rayleigh scattering of the incoming laser light , and an incoherent part , resulting from an absorption and re - emission cycle . including pure dephasing , the fraction of coherently scattered photons is given by @xmath42 ( see appendix [ apdx_theory_qdres ] for a complete description of the resonant spectrum . )",

    "the last point highlights the importance of achieving a small dephasing rate .",
    "conversely , the ratio decreases at high power where the strong excitation leads to inelastic scattering ( mollow triplet ) .",

    "[ fig3]b , the four dips corresponding to the d2-transitions of @xmath16rb and @xmath14rb can now clearly be resolved , showing negligible broadening of the atomic transitions beyond that of the atomic vapor itself .",
    "this implies that the spectrum of the light scattered by the qd has been narrowed down significantly below the lifetime limit , a clear evidence of coherent scattering from the qd @xcite .",
    "to fit the measured spectrum in the rayleigh regime , we compute the convolution between the atomic spectrum and the resonant emission spectrum , with @xmath27 , @xmath44 and @xmath30 as free parameters . in order to determine a value for each parameter with the highest accuracy , we perform a global fit on both the transmission spectrum ( fig .

    "we thus combine , in a solid - state environment , a high single photon flux with negligible dephasing , a key result for further quantum optics experiments , for instance the generation of indistinguishable photons .",
    "in addition , this conclusion applies not only under resonant excitation ( resonance fluorescence ) , but also under non - resonant excitation ( photoluminescence ) .",
    "this is a surprising result in the context of ingaas qds where the transform limit has been achieved only with resonant excitation and for very specific conditions @xcite ; in the best case with non - resonant excitation the linewidth is about a factor of two larger than the transform limit @xcite and is typically much larger still .",

    "<S> the qd resonance fluorescence in the low power regime is dominated by rayleigh scattering , a route to match quantum dot and rb atom linewidths and to shape the temporal wave packet of the qd photons . </S>",
    "<S> noise in the solid - state environment is relatively benign : there is a blinking of the resonance fluorescence at mhz rates but negligible dephasing of the qd excitonic transition . </S>",
