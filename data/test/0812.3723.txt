    "in the current paradigm of galaxy formation , it is believed that virtually all galaxies initially form as ` disks ' owing to the cooling of gas with non - zero angular momentum in virialized dark matter haloes .",
    "this smooth gas accretion dominates the galactic gas supply and hence the fuel for star formation .",
    "galaxies that reside in the centers of lower mass halos , those with masses less than @xmath3 , accrete gas through very efficient cold mode accretion , i.e. gas that is never heated ( keres et al .",
    "2005 , keres et al .",
    "the central galaxies that reside in larger halos accrete their gas through the classic , but less efficient , hot mode of accretion where the gas is shock heated to near the virial temperature near the virial radius and then must cool to be accreted by the central galaxy .",
    "hence the naive expectation would be that dwarf galaxies should be actively star forming and blue .",
    "however , when a small halo is accreted by a larger halo , i.e. when it becomes a subhalo , the central galaxy that formed in the small halo becomes a satellite galaxy and may experience a number of environmental effects that may change its properties .",
    "for instance , the diffuse gas originally associated with the subhalo may be stripped , thus removing the fuel for future star - formation ( e.g. larson , tinsley & caldwell 1980 ) .",
    "this process , referred to as strangulation ( balogh & morris 2000 ) , can result in a gradual decline of the star formation rate in the satellite galaxy , making it redder with the passage of time . if the external pressure is sufficiently high , ram - pressure stripping may also be able to remove the entire cold gas reservoir of the satellite ( e.g. gunn & gott 1972 ) , causing a fast quenching of its star formation .",
    "a satellite galaxy is also subject to tidal heating and stripping and galaxy harassment ( moore et al 1996 ) , which may also cause the satellite to lose its fuel for star formation .",
    "these processes are believed to have played an important role in the evolution of satellite galaxies , and to be responsible , to a large extent , for the relation between galaxy properties and their environment .",
    "indeed , satellite galaxies are generally found to be redder and somewhat more concentrated than central galaxies with similar stellar masses ( e.g. van den bosch et al .",
    "2008a ; weinmann et al .",
    "2008 ; yang et al . 2008b",

    "furthermore , recent investigations based on cosmological @xmath4-body simulations have shown that a significant fraction of dark matter haloes that are close to , but beyond the virial radius of , a more massive neighboring halo , are physically connected to their neighbor .",
    "as shown by lin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and more recently by ludlow et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , some low - mass halos are _ physically _ associated with more massive halos , in the sense that they were once subhalos within the virial radii of these more massive progenitors and have subsequently been ejected .",
    "this population of halos was found to extend beyond three times the virial radii of their host halos , and represents about @xmath5 of the entire population of low - mass halos ( wang , mo & jing 2008 ) .",
    "if galaxies have managed to form in the progenitors of these ejected halos , it is likely that the same environmental processes operating on satellite galaxies may also have affected the properties of these galaxies . in particular",
    ", we would expect the presence of a red population of faint galaxies that are closely associated with massive halos that once hosted them .",
    "galaxies are observed to be bimodal in the color - magnitude plane : red galaxies with very little star formation ( the red sequence ) and blue star forming galaxies that are typically disky ( the blue cloud ) ( e.g. kauffman et al .",
    "2003 , baldry et al . 2004 ) extrapolating the observed division line ( yang et al .",
    "2008a ) to dwarf galaxies we surprisingly find that for central dwarf galaxies in the sdss , with @xmath6-band magnitudes between -14.46 and -17.05 , just over 1/4 are red .",
    "in this paper we will investigate the nature of these red dwarf galaxies .",
    "quantifying the spatial distribution of this population of galaxies is clearly important , because it allows us to determine whether or not they can be explained as a population of satellite galaxies that were ejected from larger halos .    in this paper",

    "the 1500 galaxies with the highest rank ( i.e. the 1500 faintest galaxies ) make up our first sample , called s1 , the galaxies with ranks 1501 - 3000 make up sample s2 , and those with ranks 3001 - 4500 sample s3 .",

    "to study how the spatial distribution of dwarf galaxies depends on galaxy color , we separate each of the samples , s1 , s2 , and s3 , into red and blue subsamples . in particular , we define a color cut @xmath23 and we adjust the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 such that samples s1 , s2 , and s3 roughly have the same fractions of galaxies , @xmath26 , redder than this particular cut .",

    "red galaxies are defined to be the reddest 20% of all galaxies ( both centrals and satellites ) in our sample of dwarf galaxies .",
    "clearly , dwarf galaxies that are satellites have a much higher red fraction than central dwarf galaxies . for comparison , extrapolating the observed division line between the red sequence and the blue cloud from yang et al .",
    "( 2008a ) down to dwarf galaxies one would find that 33.8% , 22.5% , and 19.5% of the central galaxies in the s1 , s2 , and s3 samples , respectively , were red . while in total , there are more red central dwarfs than red satellite dwarfs , which is so far not predicted , e.g. by halo occupation models ( brown et al .",
    "note that different definition of red galaxies may change these fractions ( e.g. with respect to the galaxies of similar stellar masses ) , however not the general results we find in this paper .",
    "in this section , we investigate how central dwarf galaxies are distributed with respect to their nearest more massive halo ( i.e. more massive than their own halo ) .",
    "since the distances of galaxies based on redshifts suffer from redshift distortions , we separate the distance between a central dwarf galaxy and its nearest more massive halo into two components : @xmath30 , which is the separation along the line - of - sight , and @xmath31 , which is the separation in the perpendicular direction .    for each group in the catalogue , we use the assigned halo mass , @xmath10 , to estimate its halo radius , @xmath32^{1/3}$ ] , which follows from defining the mean mass density within a halo as @xmath33 times the average density of the universe , @xmath34 .",

    "the central galaxy is then said to be at a scaled ` distance ' @xmath38 from a massive halo , and the halo is referred to as the nearest halo of the galaxy .",

    "the data point at @xmath48 , indicates the fraction of red _ satellite _ galaxies within the same luminosity range as the central galaxies .",
    "note that the results obtained for s1 , s2 , and s3 are almost identical , indicating that the spatial distribution of dwarf galaxies around massive haloes does not depend on their luminosities .",
    "however , if we consider much brighter galaxies , e.g. at @xmath49 , the radial dependence starts to level off .",
    "there is a clear trend that the fraction of red central dwarf galaxies increases with decreasing scaled distance to the nearest halo .",
    "the fraction of the 20% reddest population at @xmath50 is around 5% to 10% , increases systematically to @xmath51% at @xmath52 , and to @xmath53% at @xmath54 for the satellite galaxies . for the other three cases ( with @xmath55% , 40% and 50% ) , the fraction also decreases with @xmath38 , but reaches a higher level at large @xmath38 .",
    "this indicates that the less red galaxies in these subsamples are not strongly associated with massive halos .",
    "we quantify the association of red dwarf galaxies with massive halos by fitting the data obtained from s3 shown in the four panels simultaneously with a function @xmath56 , where @xmath57 . in the fit",
    "we subtract a constant of , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , from the data for the 30% , 40% and 50% reddest subsamples , respectively , to account for the component that is not closely associated with massive halos .",

    "[ fig : f_r ] as the green , long - dashed lines .",
    "we have also checked the radial distribution of the central dwarf galaxies when using @xmath63% to define the subsample of red dwarfs . in this case , we find less than a 5% decrease in the red fraction at large @xmath38 , indicating that the 5% least red galaxies in the 20% reddest subsample are not randomly but more closely distributed relative to the massive halos . thus the overall results suggest that the @xmath64 - @xmath65 reddest dwarf galaxies are quite distinct from the other dwarfs , in that they reveal a clear preference to reside close to their nearest more massive dark matter halo . in addition , the non - zero red fraction at large @xmath38 indicates that there is a @xmath66 tail of red dwarfs randomly distributed throughout the background population , especially in the voids , due to some processes that shut down the star formation .",
    "a similar trend has also been found by cooper et al .",
    "( 2007 ) from the deep2 survey , however for more massive galaxies in low density regions at higher redshifts . in  [ sec_mock ] , we use mock galaxy redshift surveys constructed from cosmological @xmath4-body simulations to quantify this connection .      apart from a color dependence",
    ", we also check whether the radial distribution of dwarf galaxies with respect to their nearest more massive dark matter halos depends on their surface brightness profiles . to this end , we split our dwarf galaxies into two subsamples according to the value of their concentration parameter @xmath67 . here",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 are the radii that contain 90 and 50 percent of the petrosian @xmath6-band flux , respectively . as shown in strateva et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , @xmath70 is a reasonable proxy for the hubble type , with @xmath71 corresponding to early - type galaxies . we , therefore , separate galaxies into high ( @xmath71 ) and low ( @xmath72 ) concentrations , as illustrated in the lower - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : concen ] .",
    "roughly 20% of the dwarf galaxies thus end up in the high - concentration subsample .",
    "the lower - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : f_con ] shows the fraction of galaxies in this high - concentration subsample as a function of the scaled distance to the nearest more massive halo . unlike the reddest galaxies , the most concentrated galaxies have a radial distribution that is similar to that of the total population of central dwarf galaxies .",
    "note however , for brighter galaxies , especially in and around clusters , there is a so called morphology - radius relation ( e.g. , dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) , which according to park & hwang ( 2008 ) may be largely induced by the interaction of the target galaxy with its nearest ( early - type ) neighbor galaxy .",
    "before we proceed to study the origin of the central red dwarf galaxies , there are a number of issues that need to be addressed .",
    "an obvious worry is that the group finder is not perfect , and has misclassified a number of satellite galaxies as central galaxies .",
    "we will discuss this issue in more detail with the help of mock galaxy and group catalogs in ",
    "[ sec_mock ] . in this section",
    "we discuss systematics that can be addressed without the need for mock catalogs .      for a given luminosity",
    ", redder galaxies are expected to have a larger stellar mass .",
    "the color separation used above may thus introduce a bias in the sense that galaxies in the redder subsample are systematically more massive . to check whether or not the color distribution we obtained in the previous section is robust when the dwarf galaxies are selected in a similar stellar mass bin , we construct a controlled subsample s4 , where stellar masses for galaxies are estimated using the relation between the stellar mass - to - light ratio and color obtained by bell et al.(2003 ) .",
    "note that the survey _ magnitude limit _ of the sdss observation corresponds to a higher ( lower ) _ stellar mass limit _ for the redder ( bluer ) galaxies .",
    "in general , one can construct a stellar mass limit sample ( and hence the subsample s4 ) for all ( including both red and blue ) galaxies by adopting the stellar mass limit ( as a function of redshift ) for the reddest galaxies ( see appendix of van den bosch et al .",
    "2008b ) , which , however , may significantly reduce the number of dwarf galaxies in our sample . instead , as a rough approximation , we construct subsample s4 as follows ( with the hidden assumption that if the galaxies are complete in both luminosity and stellar mass they have similar color distributions and thus similar red and blue fractions ) .",
    "first , we separate all the dwarf galaxies into red and blue populations : the reddest 20% being red and the rest being blue , using the separation line shown in the upper - left panel of fig  [ fig : col ] .",
    "next , for each of the ( 1500@xmath7320%@xmath74 ) red galaxies in s1 , we randomly select four blue galaxies from the blue population with stellar masses within @xmath75 of the red galaxy .",
    "this yields a blue control sample of ( 1500@xmath7380%@xmath76 ) dwarf galaxies , which has the same stellar mass distribution as the 20% reddest galaxies .",
    "the control subsample s4 so constructed has exactly the same red fraction of dwarf galaxies as s1 , but now with respect to blue galaxies with similar stellar masses .",

    "[ fig : concen ] shows the color - stellar mass relation for s4 , split into red and blue galaxies .    for comparison",
    ", we also form the following two subsamples from s4 .",
    "in one , we randomly select 20% of the galaxies from s4 ; in the other , we select the 20% bluest galaxies that have the same stellar mass distribution as all the galaxies in sample s4",

    "this dependence on the scaled distance , @xmath81 , is only slightly weaker than that for the corresponding luminosity sample s1 , indicating that the bias caused by the stellar - mass difference between the red and blue subsamples is not important .",

    "[ fig : f_con ] show the results obtained for the 20% bluest galaxies and for the 20% random galaxies ( as defined above ) .",

    "although one expects such a lack of radial dependence for the random subsample , it does indicate that there are no significant systematic errors in our analysis .",
    "the lack of a radial dependence for the 20% bluest subsample is due to the fact that only the @xmath82 reddest galaxies reveal a radial distribution that is peaked towards smaller @xmath38 .      in our analysis above , the `` nearest more massive halo '' of a central dwarf galaxy is defined as the halo with a line - of - sight separation @xmath83 which has ( i ) a mass that is more massive than that of the dwarf galaxy , and ( ii ) the smallest value of @xmath38 ( see section  [ sec_analyze ] ) .",

    "note that there is a very large amount of scatter in @xmath86 , ranging from unity to well in excess of 1000 .",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether the color dependence of the radial distribution of central dwarfs with respect to their nearest more massive halo depends on @xmath84 .",
    "this can provide valuable insight into the actual origin of this color dependence .",
    "we therefore proceed as follows .",
    "we first combine samples s1+s2+s3 , and then calculate the fraction of central red dwarf galaxies that belong to the 20% reddest subsample as we did in  [ sec_analyze ] . however , now we only select systems for which @xmath86 is restricted to [ 1,2 ] , [ 2,4 ] , [ 4,8 ] or @xmath87\\ge   12.0 $ ] , respectively .",

    "[ fig : m_n ] as indicated . for comparison",
    "we also show , in each panel , the results obtained for all systems ( i.e. @xmath88 ) .",
    "a comparison of all four panels shows that there is a clear , albeit somewhat weak , dependence of the trend on @xmath86 .",
    "overall , the colors of central dwarf galaxies are most strongly affected by nearest neighbor halos that are more massive . in the case of @xmath89 ( upper - left panel ) ,",
    "the central dwarf galaxies have a @xmath90 that is almost independent of @xmath38 , and much lower than that of the dwarf satellites . on the other hand , the central dwarfs that are distributed around halos more massive than @xmath91 ( lower - right panel ) , have a radial dependence that is somewhat stronger than that for all systems .",
    "since the sdss is not a full - sky survey , and since our group catalogue is constructed using only galaxies with redshifts @xmath92 , our results may be influenced by edge effects of the survey : for central dwarf galaxies near an edge of the survey , there is an enhanced probability that it is actually a satellite ( or central ) galaxy in a more massive group ( halo ) , but for which all other members just happen to lie beyond the edges of the survey .",
    "although we tried to take these effects into account when assigning halo masses to our groups ( see yang et al .",
    "2007 for details ) , it could still be that a significant fraction of our central dwarf galaxies are in reality misclassified centrals or satellites owes to the survey geometry .    to check the impact of these edge effects",

    "finally we construct a group catalogue from this mock redshift survey , using the same halo - based group finder as for the real sdss dr4 .    to test the impact of contamination on our observational results obtained above , we consider three models for the distribution of red dwarf galaxies :    * case i : here",
    "we assume that a fraction , @xmath105 , of true _",
    "satellite _ dwarf galaxies are red , but that all true central dwarf galaxies are blue .",
    "* case ii : same as case i , but here we assume that a fraction , @xmath106 , of true central dwarf galaxies are also red and have the same spatial distribution as blue central dwarfs .",
    "* case iii : similar to case ii , but here we assume that @xmath107 depends on the distance of the central galaxy to its nearest more massive halo , according to @xmath108 . here",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants and @xmath109 .",
    "these models are used to assign a color to each of the mock dwarf galaxies according to their positions in real space and their true membership of host halos .    as for the observational data , we select the 4500 faintest galaxies from the mock group catalogue , using the same criteria as described in subsection  [ sec : samples ] . we choose the observational result for the central galaxies in s1+s2+s3 ( shown as the dots with error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_n ] to compare with our models . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "this result is representative of the distribution of red dwarf galaxies with respect to their nearest more massive halos . for all cases ( i , ii and iii ) , we adopt @xmath110 so that the red fraction of the satellite galaxies is consistent with the sdss data ( repeated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mock ] as a solid line ) . in case",
    "ii we set @xmath111 , so that the red fraction of the central galaxies at large projected distance , @xmath112 , is roughly the same as the observational data .",
    "the corresponding results obtained from case i and case ii are shown in the upper - left and upper - right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : mock ] , respectively .",
    "it is clear that in case i , in which the only red dwarfs are satellites , the fraction of false central galaxies in the mock catalogue is too small too match the observational data at @xmath113 . for case",
    "ii , although by construction the fraction of red central galaxies matches the observational results at large @xmath114 , the model underestimates the fraction of red central galaxies at intermediate @xmath38 .",
    "these results indicate that ( i ) not all red dwarf galaxies are satellites , and ( ii ) the central red dwarf galaxies have a different distribution than the total central dwarf population .",
    "now , let us look at case iii .",
    "we have experimented with different values for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and found that the following set of parameters matches the observational data reasonably well : @xmath115 .",
    "the results obtained from the mock catalogue using this set of model parameters are shown in the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mock ] .",
    "this shows that the central red dwarf galaxies are correlated with massive halos on scales given by @xmath116 ( i.e. @xmath117 ) .    finally ,",
    "as we did for the observational sample , we can also obtain @xmath118 for dwarf galaxies near halos of different masses using the mock sample case iii .",
    "as an illustration , we consider the case with @xmath119 .",
    "the model for @xmath120 that best matches the observational result has @xmath121 and is slightly steeper than that obtained for the case without any restrictions on @xmath84 .",
    "the model prediction obtained from the mock sample is shown in the lower - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mock ] along with the corresponding observational data .",
    "in the mock catalogue considered above , the distribution of satellite galaxies in individual halos is assumed to be spherically symmetric and to follow the nfw ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) profile ( see yang et al .",
    "2004 for details ) . in reality",
    ", the distribution of satellite galaxies in individual halos may not be spherical , which may cause further contaminations of the group memberships selected by the group finder . to test this ,",
    "we have constructed a mock catalogue assuming that the distribution of satellite galaxies in individual halos is triaxial , with axis ratios given by the model of jing & suto ( 2002 ) for cdm halos .",
    "we found a slightly higher level of contamination in this new mock catalogue , but it does not change any of our results significantly . as an illustration , in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mock ] we also show the results for non - spherical halos using symbols connected with dot - dashed lines .",
    "we obtain for case iii slightly weaker radial dependence with @xmath122 and @xmath123 , for the cases shown in the lower - left and lower - right panels , respectively .",
    "we set out to understand why about 1/4 of _ central _ dwarf galaxies , those with @xmath6-band magnitudes between -14.46 and -17.05 , are red when one defines a dwarf galaxy to be red by extrapolating the division between red sequence galaxies and the blue cloud , as determined by yang et al .",
    "( 2008a ) for brighter galaxies , down to dwarf magnitudes .",
    "current models of galaxy formation would naively expect such galaxies to be blue since they would be efficiently accreting gas through cold mode accretion and rapidly converting it into stars .    in a recent study , ludlow et al .",
    "( 2008 ; see also lin et al .",
    "2003 ) analysed the properties of subhalos in galaxy - sized cold dark matter halos using a suite of cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "the subhalos in their definition refer to the whole population of subhalos physically associated with the main system , including both subhalos that are found within the virial radius of the host halo at the present time , and halos that were once within the virial radius of the main progenitor of the host and have survived as self - bound entities until @xmath124 .",
    "they found that such populations can extend beyond _ three times _ the virial radius , and contain objects on extreme orbits , with some approaching the nominal escape speed from the system . on average",
    "the subhalos identified within the virial radius represent only about _",
    "one half _ of all associated subhalos , and many relatively central halos may have actually been ejected in the past from a more massive system .",
    "since galaxies are assumed to form in dark matter halos , it is interesting to see if the results we obtain here can be understood in terms of galaxy formation in this population of subhalos .    according to the current theory of galaxy formation",
    ", satellite galaxies can experience various environmental effects that can quench their star formation and make them red ( e.g. , van den bosch et al . 2008b and",
    "references therein ) .",
    "because the galaxies in ejected subhalos have also been satellite galaxies , at least for some period of time , they are likely to have been subjected to similar environmental effects , and thus to have experienced some quenching of their star formation rates .",
    "it is thus likely that the association of red dwarf galaxies with massive halos presented here is produced by the association of ejected subhalos with their ( former ) hosts .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab1 ] , about 30% of the dwarf galaxies are satellite galaxies . according to the results obtained by ludlow et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , there should thus also be a significant fraction of dwarf galaxies that are physically associated with nearby more massive halos out to about three times the virial radius .",
    "if these associated galaxies ( now outside their hosts ) have properties similar to the satellite galaxies , we would expect an enhanced fraction of red dwarf galaxies that are distributed outside massive halos .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with our findings presented above and also as shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "however , since the observational data are obtained in redshift space and based on galaxy groups that may contain interlopers and may be incomplete , a detailed comparison between the data and the models requires the construction of mock catalogues that make use of the subhalo population and contain all the observational selection effects .",
    "the fact that central dwarf galaxies have concentrations that are independent of their distances to the nearest massive halos indicates that the processes that causes them to become red does not have a significant impact on their structure .",
    "this is similar to the results obtained by van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2008a ) who found that the transformation mechanisms operating on satellites affect color more than structure ( see also kauffmann et al .",
    "2004 ; blanton et al . 2005a ; ball , loveday & brunner 2008 ; weinmann et al .",
    "2008 ) . once again , this similarity between red dwarfs that are satellites and those that are centrals suggests that both populations may have experienced similar kinds of environmental effects",
    ".    however , as shown in table  [ tab1 ] , in the s1+s2+s3 sample less than 42% of the red dwarf central galaxies have @xmath125 .",
    "in other words , more than 58% of the red dwarf central galaxies are not close enough to a larger halo so that they could have been preprocessed there , becoming red and then subsequently being ejected .",
    "the origin of this population of central red dwarf galaxies , which is almost 10% of the combined s1+s2+s3 dwarf sample , still remains a mystery within the standard paradigm of galaxy formation .",
    "furthermore , if we had used stellar mass instead of @xmath6-band magnitude to define our dwarf sample , the percentage of galaxies in this population would likely increase .",
    "this population of isolated red dwarfs are not merely a dust reddened star forming population seen near edge - on because their axis ratios are consistent with a randomly oriented population .",
    "although as croton & farrar ( 2008 ) probed the origin of the red dwarfs in voids using the semi - analytical models , they only found @xmath126 of the dwarfs in the total population are red centrals in voids . while here we find that @xmath127 dwarfs are red centrals without close neighbours with @xmath128 .",
    "an outstanding problem for all galaxy formation models concerns the low mass slope of the galaxy mass function .",
    "cdm models in general predict too many low - mass dark matter haloes compared to the number of low mass galaxies .",
    "the mass function of dark matter haloes , @xmath129 , scales with halo mass roughly as @xmath130 at the low - mass end .",
    "this is in strong contrast with the observed luminosity function of galaxies , @xmath131 , which has a rather shallow shape at the faint end , with @xmath132 . to reconcile this difference one usually invokes some form of feedback within these low mass halos .",
    "if the feedback mechanism were to prevent gas from entering these halos at late times , such galaxies would appear red .",
    "for example , the preheating mechanism of mo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , where gas is preheated by gas shocks within the forming large scale structures in which the low mass dark matter halos themselves are forming , has this feature .",
    "therefore , this population of isolated , red , central dwarf galaxies could represent the tail of the process that prevents the vast majority of low mass dark matter halos from forming galaxies and their further study could shed new light on the mechanism responsible .",
