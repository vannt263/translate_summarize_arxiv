    "quantum effects are of vital importance on collective phenomena in dense plasmas @xcite which may be encountered in astrophysical objects like white dwarfs , active galactic nuclei and neutron stars @xcite or in metals and artificially manufactured compounds like semiconductors and nano - structured materials @xcite .",
    "one of the key features of dense plasmas is the quantum degeneracy effect due to pauli exclusion principal which starts playing an effective role when the de broglie thermal wavelength @xmath0 of the plasma ingredients is larger than the average inter - particle distances , @xmath1 @xcite or equivalently when the particles temperature is below the characteristic fermi - temperature .",
    "this condition is well satisfied for metals and dense astrophysical objects . on the other hand , a zero temperature fermi gas model , in which all electrons are in degenerated state , may be an idealistic assumption for real hot quantum plasmas such as white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "therefore , at some circumstances such as the white dwarf surface one may expect two types of electrons , namely , degenerate and non - degenerate .    on the other hand , recently the field of quantum plasmas , has achieved much attention due to diverse applications in rapidly growing miniaturization technology @xcite .",
    "different aspects of nonlinear wave phenomenon in quantum plasma systems has been studied using quantum hydrodynamics ( qhd ) model @xcite .",
    "also , higher nonlinearity effects which is supposed to play significant role in nonlinear wave dynamics in quantum plasmas has been investigated in electron - positron - ion plasmas , where it has been shown that the quantum tunneling effects , caused due to quantum force , gives rise to higher dispersion rather than dissipation of solitary propagations and greatly affects the nonlinear wave dynamics @xcite .",
    "the small amplitude electron - acoustic solitary excitations in partially degenerate ( two - temperature ) quantum plasmas has been studies by number of authors @xcite .",
    "misra et.al @xcite have found ranges of cold - to - hot electron density ratio and the quantum diffraction parameter values which correspond to different types of solitary excitations .",
    "also , recent investigation of electron - acoustic solitary propagations has shown that critical hot - to - cold electron densities can exist in two electron species quantum plasmas @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it has been noted that the propagation of the electron - acoustic waves remain undamped in the range @xmath2 @xcite , where , @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the cold and hot electrons equilibrium densities , respectively .    in current study the qhd model is applied to investigate the higher - nonlinearity effects on electron - acoustic solitary excitations in two - electron - type quantum electron - ion plasma .",
    "the results obtained here cab be helpful in astrophysical dense - plasma such as white dwarfs .",

    "description of quantum hydrodynamics state equations is given in section ii .",

    "section v presents the discussions based on the numerical analysis and , finally , section vi devotes to the concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we consider a collision - less unmagnetized quantum plasma with two types of electrons , namely , degenerate and non - degenerate and additional neutralizing background inertial ions .",
    "this model may be appropriate for characterizing a plasma near the gaseous fringe of a white dwarf @xcite , where both degenerate and non - degenerate electron populations may be present .",

    "the collisions in such plasma are assumed to be limited due to fermi - blocking process , hence , to be considered as collision - less .",
