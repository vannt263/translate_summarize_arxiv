    "@xcite discovered an excitation mechanism of stellar oscillations that is related to the opacity behaviour in ionisation zones : the @xmath0-mechanism , where @xmath0 denotes the opacity .",
    "this mechanism occurs when the opacity varies during compression phases so as to block the emerging radiative flux @xcite .",
    "ionisation regions correspond to a strong increase in opacity that leads to the _ opacity bumps _",
    "responsible for the local excitation of modes .",
    "these driving zones should nevertheless be located at a precise radius inside the star , neither too close to the surface nor to deep , in order to balance the damping that mainly occurs at the surface .",
    "it defines the so - called _ transition region _ that shapes the limit between the quasi - adiabatic interior and the strongly non - adiabatic surface . for classical cepheids that pulsate in the fundamental acoustic mode , this transition region",
    "is located at a temperature @xmath1 k corresponding to the second helium ionisation @xcite .",
    "however , the bump location is not solely responsible for the acoustic instability .",
    "a careful treatment of the @xmath0-mechanism would involve dynamical couplings with convection , metallicity effects and both realistic equations of state and opacity tables @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our model is to simplify the hydrodynamic approach while retaining the _ leading - order _ phenomenon e.g .",
    "the location of the opacity bump or its amplitude such that feasible direct numerical simulations of the @xmath0-mechanism with convection can be achieved .",
    "we first focus on radial modes propagating in a purely - radiative and partially - ionised layer and then restrict our study to the 1-d case .",
    "our model consists of a _ local zoom _ about an ionisation region and is composed by a monatomic and perfect gas ( with @xmath2 ) under both a constant gravity @xmath3 and kinematic viscosity @xmath4 .",
    "all quantities in our model are dimensionless , e.g. temperature is given in unit of the surface temperature of the star , length in unit of a fraction of the star radius and velocity in unit of the sound speed at the surface .    in order to easily investigate the influence of the opacity bump on the stability ,",

    ", we then determine the physical conditions that lead to unstable modes excited by the @xmath0-mechanism in our layer ( cf .",
    "paper i ) .    the two criteria ( [ eq : kt ] ) and ( [ eq : psi ] ) predict that modes are unstable for a `` sufficient '' hollow ( adequate amplitude and width ) that is located in the transition region . using the work integral computed from the obtained eigenvectors , we indeed recover instability strips for the @xmath0-mechanism by considering the three different equilibrium setups ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wi ] ) :    * the first case ( dotted blue line , @xmath30 ) corresponds to a hot star with an ionisation region close to the surface . as the surrounding density is small , @xmath31 and",
    "the conductivity hollow hardly influences the work integral : driving is unable to prevail over damping , leading to @xmath32 or _",
    "stable _ modes . * in the second case ( solid green line , @xmath33 ) , the radiative conductivity begins to decrease significantly at the location of the transition region where @xmath34 . as a consequence ,",
    "driving becomes important .",
    "furthermore , the radiative conductivity increase occurs where non - adiabatic effects are already significant , i.e. @xmath35 there .",
    "it means that no damping occurs between the hollow position and the surface as the radiative flux perturbations are frozen - in .",
    "driving is overcoming damping in this case , therefore @xmath36 and modes are _ unstable_. * the third case ( dashed red line , @xmath37 ) corresponds to a cold star of which ionisation region is located deeper in the stellar atmosphere where @xmath38 .",
    "ionisation then occurs in a quasi - adiabatic location . as a consequence ,",
    "the excitation provided by the conductivity hollow can not balance the damping arising at the top of the layer , thus @xmath39 and modes are _",
    "stable_.    in conclusion ,",
    "our first radiative model of the @xmath0-mechanism is well able to reproduce the main physics involved in the oscillations of cepheid stars : _",

[",
    "fig : fourier]a ) .",
    "the mean spectrum follows by integrating @xmath45 over depth ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fourier]b ) . with this method ,",
    "acoustic modes are extracted because they emerge as `` shark - fin profiles '' about definite eigenfrequencies @xcite .",
    "several discrete peaks corresponding to normal modes well appear but the fundamental mode close to @xmath46 clearly dominates . moreover ,",
    "the linear eigenfunctions are compared to the mean profiles computed from a zoom taken in the dns power spectrum about eigenfrequencies @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fourier]c ) .",
    "the agreement between the linear eigenfunctions ( dotted blue lines ) and the dns profiles ( solid black lines ) is remarkable . in summary ,",
    "[ fig : fourier ] shows that several overtones are present in the dns , even for long times .",
    "these overtones are however _ linearly stable _ suggesting that some underlying energy transfers occur between modes through nonlinear couplings .",
    "these nonlinear interactions are investigated thanks to a tool that measures the sound generation by turbulent flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it involves projections of the dns physical fields onto the regular and adjoint eigenvectors that are solutions to the linear oscillation equations .",
    "the projection coefficients then give the time evolution of each acoustic mode that is present in the dns _",
    "separately_. furthermore , as the evolution of the kinetic energy of each mode is also accessible with this method , one can follow the energy transfer between modes .     and",
    "@xmath48 acoustic modes.,width=302 ]    figure [ fig : nrj ] shows an example of the time evolution of the kinetic energy ratio @xmath49 for the two modes @xmath50 ( i.e. the fundamental one ) and @xmath48 ( i.e. the second overtone ) .",
    "here @xmath51 denotes the kinetic energy embedded in the acoustic mode of order @xmath52 , while @xmath53 is the total kinetic energy in the simulation .",
    "after its linear transient growth , a given fraction of the fundamental mode energy is progressively transferred to the second overtone until the nonlinear saturation is achieved above time @xmath54 , with finally @xmath55 of the total kinetic energy in the @xmath56 mode and the remaining @xmath57 in the @xmath48 one .",
    "we recall that it is at a first glance surprising to detect this second overtone at long times because it is linearly stable and should normally be damped by diffusive effects .",
    "the reason for its presence lies in a favored coupling in the period ratio between these two modes .",
    "indeed , the fundamental period is @xmath58 in this simulation while the @xmath48 one is @xmath59 . as a consequence ,",
    "the corresponding period ratio is close to one half ( @xmath60 ) such that the second overtone is involved in the nonlinear saturation through a 2:1 resonance with the fundamental mode .",
    "the linear growth of the fundamental mode is then balanced by the pumping of energy to the stable second overtone that behaves as an energy sink , leading to the full limit - cycle stability .",
    "after the previous results obtained on purely radiative models in 1-d , we next address the convection - pulsation coupling that is suspected to quench the radial oscillations of cepheids close to the red edge .",
    "the idea is to slightly modify the unstable radiative setup to obtain a convective zone superimposed to the ionisation region in 2-d simulations .",
    "the convective instability obeys schwarzschild s criterion given by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )          figure [ fig : vort ] displays a snapshot of the vorticity field obtained in such a convective simulation at time @xmath65 . in order to ensure that the thermal relaxation is well achieved ,",
    "we ran this simulation for a much longer time than in the purely - radiative case and the resolution is @xmath66 gridpoints . as expected , convection develops in the middle of the box where the conductivity hollow is located .",
    "moreover , because of the density contrast across the convection zone , the vorticity is trapped in strong convective plume downdrafts that easily overshoot in the stable zone below due to their low pclet number @xcite .      to address the time evolution of the acoustic modes that are present in the dns with convection",
    ", we project as before the physical fields onto an appropriate acoustic subspace to get the projection coefficient @xmath67 . here",
    "@xmath68 denotes the mode degree while @xmath52 is its order ( with @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the width of the box ) .            where @xmath72 is the pressure scale height , @xmath73 the vertical extent of the convection zone , @xmath74 the radiative diffusivity and @xmath75 the entropy .",
    "this number allows to quantify the strength of the convective motions , that is , the critical rayleigh number above which convection develops is about @xmath76 for polytropic stratifications ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the first simulation ( @xmath77 , solid blue line ) , the rayleigh number is slightly super - critical and the convection intensity is weak . in this case , we see that the acoustic energy ratio remains large ( i.e. @xmath78 , the remaining @xmath79 being in the convection ) and the nonlinear saturation is reached in the same way than in the previous radiative models . in other words ,",
    "the mode propagation is not affected by convective motions and the convection can be seen as _ frozen - in_.    on the contrary , increasing the rayleigh number leads to a more vigorous convection and the acoustic energy ratio is much more affected by convective plumes ( dashed green line ) . indeed , after a long transient during which it reaches a non - trifling value ( @xmath80 )",
    ", it progressively tends to zero at long times while the convective motions are responsible for the whole kinetic energy content .",
    "the radial oscillations excited by @xmath0-mechanism are thus quenched by convection and this situation is relevant to the red edge where the unstable acoustic modes are known to be damped by convective motions occuring at the star s surface .",
    "we thus have shown that the rayleigh number is a key parameter for this problem . but",
    "further investigations of the convection - pulsation coupling are in progress , by especially checking time - dependent theories of convection for which several free parameters can be constrained by such kind of direct numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?"
