    "as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) continues to successfully probe the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking ( a recent breakthrough being the discovery of a higgs candidate  @xcite ) , a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem , if it exists , has evaded our efforts so far .",
    "an elegant candidate for such a solution and one which addresses several other open issues as well , _",
    "e.g. _ dark matter and gauge coupling unification , is supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "because of its theoretical appeal , it is important to understand all the guises that susy may adopt in order to recognize it if it is produced at the lhc .    an important open issue in susy , which has strong ramifications for its lhc phenomenology , as well as its cosmology , is the gauge invariance of lepton and baryon number violating interactions . aside from introducing many new unknown parameters , these interactions also lead to rapid proton decay .",
    "the most common solution to address this issue is the imposing of a discrete symmetry , r - parity , defined as @xmath9 ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this forbids all tree - level lepton and baryon number violating terms and also causes the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) to be stable and therefore neutral .",
    "this lsp can then play the role of dark matter and would manifest itself at colliders as missing energy .",
    "however , proton decay requires the elimination of only the lepton number or baryon number violating terms and from a theoretical perspective , r - parity can be _",
    "ad hoc_. furthermore , an open - mindedness to possible signals at the lhc should push us to consider alternatives .",
    "finally , when r - parity is violated the stringent constraints on superpartner masses , derived from negative collider searches for missing energy events at the tevatron and the lhc @xcite , can be relaxed .    a systematic study of all possible r - parity violating terms and their effects on phenomenology is an arduous task and furthermore",
    ", one would like a mechanism for understanding why proton decay is significantly suppressed . a well - motivated solution to both of these issues",
    "are models which can predict the fate of r - parity .",
    "a natural framework for this endeavor is in the context of @xmath10 symmetries , see  @xcite for early examples can be also used to construct models where the rpv couplings , arising from effective operators , are intrinsically small @xcite . ] .",
    "while some @xmath11 models predict r - parity conservation  @xcite , the most minimal ones ( in terms of particle content ) require r - parity violation ( rpv )  @xcite .",
    "even some non - minimal models prefer rpv from considerations of the renormalization group evolution of the soft masses  @xcite .",
    "these and other models of spontaneous r - parity violation , such as  @xcite , have the common feature that they can be described , in an effective field theory way , by bilinear r - parity violation ( brpv ) : the only r - parity violating terms are the mixings between the lepton doublets and up - type higgs doublet in the superpotential .",
    "this makes brpv a powerful tool for studying possible signatures of spontaneous rpv .",
    "furthermore , proton decay is highly suppressed and it is important to mention that a gravitino lsp can be a dark matter candidate in such models  @xcite .    once r - parity is broken the lsp is no longer stable and therefore astrophysical constraints on its nature do not apply @xcite .",
    "accordingly , from a purely phenomenological point of view any superpartner can be the lsp , and studies of the different possibilities in brpv models ( and of sleptons and sneutrinos in general models  @xcite ) and their relation to neutrino masses and mixings have been carried out in e.g. @xcite .",
    "in this paper we extend upon previous results by considering sneutrino lsp decays in brpv into `` non - conventional '' modes : pairs of heavy standard model ( sm ) states ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , invisible modes ( @xmath16 ) and different - flavor charged lepton final states ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "such states , to our knowledge , had not received much attention before despite the fact that they can dominate sneutrino decays and can yield unique and unanticipated susy signals . specifically , neutrino masses force rpv to be small so its only effect is on the decay of the lsp . therefore ,",
    "for a sneutrino lsp , every susy event will eventually decay into two sneutrinos which could then decay into one of the aforementioned states .",
    "as we will show , this typically translates into into different - flavor charged leptons or heavy sm modes , depending on the sneutrino generation .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study the sneutrino decays into these `` non - conventional '' modes and to show that they can dominate over the traditionally considered @xmath19 final state .",
    "we find that the latter dominate roughly when the brpv term , @xmath20 is smaller than the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the sneutrino , @xmath21 , for a given flavor of sneutrino , @xmath22 . in the case",
    "when brpv is the only source of neutrino masses , this possibility can only hold for one sneutrino flavor , however , when this assumption is relaxed , it can hold true for all three generations .",
    "therefore , if two or more generations of sneutrinos decay via rpv , it might be possible to rule out brpv as the sole generator of neutrino masses .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : generalities ]",
    "we discuss the generalities of the brpv model , in particular those related with the neutral scalar sector . in section",
    "[ sec : sneutrino - mix - analyr ] we derive formulas for brpv induced mixings . in section  [ sec : sneutrino - decays - analyticalr ] we write the relevant couplings for brpv sneutrino decays , give analytical formulas for the different partial decay widths , analyze the constraints on parameter space enforced by neutrino data and present our results . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize and present our conclusions .",
    "in what follows we will briefly describe the main features of the bilinear r - parity breaking model , in particular those related with the neutral scalar sector .",
    "we shall closely follow the notation used in @xcite and assume that all parameters are real . throughout the text matrices",
    "will be denoted in bold - face .",
    "in addition to the mssm r - parity conserving superpotential ( where we have suppressed relevant indices ) : @xmath23 the bilinear r - parity breaking model also contains the following terms : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath26 completely antisymmetric tensor , @xmath27 runs over the sm fermion generations and @xmath20 is the r - parity and lepton number breaking bilinear parameter with units of mass .",
    "consistency then requires a new set of soft susy breaking terms in the scalar potential , namely @xmath28 neglecting soft flavor mixing , the scalar potential relevant for neutral scalars is @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "electroweak symmetry is broken once the higgs and slepton acquire a vev , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with @xmath34  gev and @xmath35 .",
    "the doublets are parameterized as @xmath36 with the neutral components given by @xmath37 here we introduce the notation @xmath38 to differentiate the cp - even sneutrinos from the cp - odd .    in the basis",
    "@xmath39 the linear part of the neutral scalar potential can be written as @xmath40 where the @xmath41 s are the so - called tadpoles . at tree - level",
    "these are ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : full - ssb - scalar - potential ] ) and ( [ eq : vlinear ] ) ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the minimization of the potential , @xmath45 , requires the tadpoles to vanish .",
    "thus , the vevs can be determined from the system of equations in ( [ eq : tree - lvel - tadpoles ] ) by imposing @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "in particular , considering only leading order brpv terms , the sneutrino vevs can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 ( the tree level sneutrino mass ) and @xmath50 .",
    "without conserved r - parity , there are no quantum numbers to distinguish the leptons and sleptons from the gauginos and higgsinos and higgs bosons respectively . therefore ,",
    "in brpv several mixings between supersymmetric and non supersymmetric particles exist : ( @xmath22 ) neutralinos mix with neutrinos , ( @xmath51 ) charginos mix with charged leptons , ( @xmath52 ) higgs bosons mix with the sneutrinos and ( @xmath53 ) charged higss bosons mix with charged sleptons .",
    "these mixings are important for calculating lsp decays , especially mixings of type ( @xmath22 ) as they allow to fix  via experimental neutrino data  the size of the brpv parameters .",
    "since mixings of type ( @xmath53 ) are not of interest for sneutrino decays , in what follows we will only discuss analytical approximations for mixings of type ( @xmath22)-(@xmath52 ) .      in the basis",

    "we begin with a very general study ignoring all neutrino constrains ( susy parameters can always be chosen in such a way so that brpv does not saturate the neutrino masses ) and exploring in the @xmath20-@xmath21 parameter space where the aforementioned modes dominate the @xmath19 decays of @xmath305 . without neutrino constraints , these decay properties are independent of generation .",

    "it is striking that the ratio of the partial widths are relatively independent of r - parity conserving susy parameters and depend only on the brpv parameters . from this figure",
    ", one can conclude that the @xmath309 and the @xmath16 partial widths dominate the @xmath19 width only when the sneutrino vev is much larger than the bilinear mixing parameter and , as will be shown below , this condition holds for the other heavy sm final states .",
    "couple this with the main result of the previous section : satisfying neutrino masses solely through brpv means that @xmath311 can only be satisfied in one generation , indicates that heavy final states as well as invisible modes can only have branching fractions larger than the @xmath211 mode for one generation of sneutrinos .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the different lepton flavor final states .",
    "these modes ( @xmath312 ) , being induced by chargino charged lepton mixing , are mainly controlled by the bilinear mixing parameters for the flavor of the final lepton which differs from the sneutrino flavor ( see eq .",

    "[ fig : epsilons - vevs ] ) .",
    "therefore the different lepton flavor final states become subdominant to the @xmath318 modes due to charged lepton yukawa suppression . in contrast , when @xmath317 ( @xmath319 modes dominate @xmath318 modes ) the different lepton flavor final states can have larger partial widths than the @xmath211 mode provided @xmath320 ^ 2 $ ] exceeds the corresponding yukawa suppression @xmath321 , which turns out to be possible only for second and third generation sneutrinos as shown in fig .",

    "can dominant over the @xmath211 final state only in a single sneutrino generation .",
    "we continue by considering the specific susy point discussed in the last section and examining first and third generation sneutrino decays into @xmath19 , @xmath326 , @xmath327 and different lepton flavor modes assuming that brpv is solely responsible for neutrino masses .",
    "we have also calculated the partial decay widths for the @xmath14 and @xmath13 final states , finding that they have a similar dependence on @xmath328 and are of the same order as the @xmath12 mode ( the @xmath329 channel is suppressed due to the off - shell top for this sneutrino mass ) .",
    "the results are displayed in figure  [ fig : width - snu1-snu3 ] versus @xmath328 , where it can be seen that @xmath330 exhibits the usual bahavior quoted in the literature , that is to say , a dominant @xmath211 mode followed by a slightly yukawa suppressed @xmath331 mode and strongly suppressed @xmath16 , @xmath319 , @xmath332 and @xmath333 final states .",
    "the huge supression of the different lepton flavor mode , @xmath334 , in the small @xmath250 region is due to the combined effect of the electron yukawa suppression and the smallness of @xmath335 .",
    "the @xmath332 final state being controlled by @xmath336 involves only the electron yukawa suppression , and so it has a larger partial decay width than the @xmath337 mode .",
    "the situation for @xmath338 , however , is quite different . in the region of large @xmath250",
    "it features a @xmath211 dominant mode and apart from the @xmath339 mode it behaves like @xmath330 . in the region of small @xmath250 , in contrast , the `` non - conventional '' modes @xmath340 ( @xmath341 ) , @xmath16 , @xmath12 , @xmath342 and @xmath343 have the largest partial widths by far , greatly surpassing the @xmath211 final state .",

    "if the brpv contributions to neutrino masses are subdominant to some other mechanism , sneutrino decays could involve large displaced vertices ( see fig .",

    "<S> in bilinear r - parity violation ( brpv ) , in which the superpotential includes a bilinear term between the lepton doublet and the up - type higgs superfields , a sneutrino lsp can decay into pairs of heavy standard model states ( @xmath0s , @xmath1s , tops or higgs bosons ) , neutrinos or different - flavor charged lepton modes ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these finals states can dominate over the traditionally considered bottom pair final state and would lead to unique and novel supersymmetric signals : multileptons events or pairs of heavy standard model fields . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate this possibility and find that the branching ratio into these states dominates when the bilinear term is much smaller than the sneutrino vacuum expectation value for a given sneutrino flavor . when brpv is the only source of neutrino masses these decays can only dominate for one of the sneutrino generations . relaxing </S>",
