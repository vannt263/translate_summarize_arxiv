    "before the era of routine afterglow observations with _ swift_-xrt , several authors claimed detection of lines in grb x - ray afterglows on top of otherwise smooth power - law spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these extreme emission measures , if produced by a constant - density medium , would require densities of order @xmath47 @xmath44 . however , a circumstellar medium this dense would be optically thick to electron scattering , violating the assumptions of the optically thin bremsstrahlung model .",
    "the emitting region would be optically thin only if the radius of the region were @xmath48 cm , much larger than typical afterglow radii .",

    "we argue that the higher - temperature black body fit is more plausible due to its relative consistency with the component observed in the first epoch and with theoretical expectations ( section [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "the blackbody components provide 11% ( 29% ) of the total 0.330kev flux in the first ( second ) epoch .",
    "the implied radii for a spherical emission region are small and consistent with constant size : @xmath55 cm and @xmath56 cm .",
    "( the radii for the disfavored low - temperature black bodies are larger but also relatively compact .",
    "however , they imply a physically unlikely _ contraction _ of the emitting region from @xmath57 cm to @xmath58 cm . )    while black body components have been reported in other grb afterglow spectra , none have been observed at such late times , with such high temperatures , or with such small radii . at 110days after the burst , the blackbody radius inferred from grb101225a was over @xmath59 cm and could be explained by the jet interaction with the circumstellar medium @xcite . the inferred radius of @xmath3 cm for grb130925ais much harder to explain with a jet interaction model .",
    "this size scale is instead on par with the radius of the fallback accretion disks expected in stellar collapse @xcite .",
    "if we assume we are observing this disk , the fit temperature can place constraints on the progenitor by constraining the conditions in the disk .",
    "the luminosity of an accretion disk is roughly equal to the potential energy released in the accretion .",
    "if we consider material at radius @xmath60 , the luminosity ( @xmath61 ) is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the accretion rate and @xmath64 denotes a small annulus of material at radius @xmath60 ( integrating over @xmath64 would produce the total luminosity ) .",
    "the blackbody emission for such an annulus is @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath67 is the blackbody temperature .",
    "if we know the temperature , we can then derive the accretion rate @xmath68 . for our observed temperatures of 4 - 5.6kev",
    ", the corresponding accretion rate is @xmath69 .",
    "fallback @xmath70s after a supernova or grb explosion has been calculated for a range of progenitors and explosion energies @xcite .",
    "fallback at late times follows a simple power law @xcite and depends on the progenitor and the explosion energy of the supernova associated with the grb .",
    "most fallback calculations @xcite predict fallback rates of @xmath71 at @xmath70s for supernova explosions of @xmath72 .",
    "our accretion rates imply a luminosity near @xmath73 times the eddington limit for a stellar mass black hole .",
    "although such extreme super - eddington emission rates have been invoked from fallback @xcite , the exact nature of such transient accretion is not well known .",
    "steady - state solutions of disk accretion find that maintaining emission rates even an order of magnitude above eddington is difficult @xcite .",
    "whether such steady state limits apply in transient situations like our fallback disk remains to be seen @xcite .",
    "thus without a full model of these transient events , we are not able to establish a self - consistent explanation for the blackbody emission .      finally , we considered a two power law model ( pl@xmath37pl ) like that reported for grb111209a @xcite .",
    "this model is a slightly worse fit in both epochs than the bb@xmath37pl model for the same number of free parameters ( table [ tab : fits ] ) .",
    "@xcite interpret the very hard ( @xmath8 ) second pl component they report for grb111209a at 70ksec after the burst as the tail of the hard power - law emission sometimes observed by _",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this component is detected in the late prompt and early afterglow phases and decays according to a powerlaw ; its physical origin remains uncertain .",
    "the non - detection by lat of both grbs complicates this interpretation .",
    "an extrapolation of our epoch1 powerlaw flux to the 0.110gev band gives a photon flux of @xmath74photons@xmath25s@xmath39 , a value higher than the upper limit of @xmath75photons@xmath25s@xmath39 reported by @xcite in the first 2ksec after the burst , when the afterglow  and thus presumably the hard component  was much brighter .",
    "the problem is even more severe for the component reported by @xcite : its higher flux and much harder spectral index extrapolate to a 0.110gev photon flux of 1.5photons@xmath25s@xmath39 , an extremely high value sufficient to trigger lat .",
    "we examined the late - time lat data for both bursts and confirm no excess emission .",
    "consistency with the nondetection by lat in both cases thus requires a cutoff above the _ nustar _  and _ xmm _ bandpasses but below the the lat bandpass at 30mev .",
