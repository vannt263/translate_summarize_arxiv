    "in next generation cellular systems , the high data rate demand requires a more efficient utilization of the limited available spectrum .",
    "the universal frequency reuse thus becomes more favourable , which however leads to more severe interference issues as compared to the traditional case with only a fractional frequency reuse .",
    "interference is therefore a dominant limiting factor for the performance of future wireless communication networks .",
    "interference channel ( ic ) is a fundamental model for multiuser wireless communication and has been extensively studied to date . a complete characterization of the capacity region of the ic corrupted by additive gaussian noise , however , is still open , even for the simplest two - user case @xcite . in the finite - snr regime",
    ", significant contributions have been made to the problem of characterizing the rate region of ics .",
    "for example , coordinated precoding / beamforming has been proposed to be implemented among bss to control the inter - cell interference ( ici ) to their best effort @xcite , @xcite , and various parametrical characterizations of the pareto boundary of the achievable rate region have been obtained for the multiple - input single - output ( miso)-ic with coordinated transmit beamforming and single - user detection @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the recent advance in the so - called interference alignment ( ia ) technique has motivated numerous studies on characterizing the rate performance of ics under the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime . with the aid of ia , the maximum achievable rates in terms of degree of freedom ( dof ) have been obtained for various ic models to provide useful insights on designing optimal transmission schemes for interference - limited communication systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "another notable advancement is the use of improper gaussian signaling ( igs ) for ics .",
    "different from conventional systems employing proper gaussian signals whose real and imaginary parts have equal power and are independent zero - mean gaussian random variables , the real and imaginary parts of improper gaussian signals have unequal power and/or are correlated @xcite .",
    "improper signals have been investigated in applications such as detection and estimation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "studies of igs in communication systems , however , only appeared recently .",
    "this may be due to the fact that proper gaussian signaling ( pgs ) has been known to be capacity optimal for the gaussian point - to - point , multiple - access , and broadcast channels ; as a result , it was presumably deemed to be optimal for ics . in @xcite , it has been shown that igs can further improve the achievable rates of the three - user ic in high - snr regime . inspired by this work , subsequent studies have investigated ics with igs in finite - snr regime . particularly , @xcite and @xcite studied the achievable rate region of the two - user siso ic .",
    "the rate region and minimum signal to interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) maximization for the @xmath0-user ic have been characterized in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these works have reported a significant rate improvement of igs over conventional pgs in terms of achievable rate under finite snr .",
    "it comes to our attention that most of the existing work on ics has focused on investigating the rate performance .",
    "however , a dual problem for ics , which minimizes the transmission error probability with given users signal modulations and/or data rates , is less exploited .",
    "notice that this problem may be more practically sensible for the scenarios when the users have their desired quality - of - service ( qos ) in terms of data rate and error performance to be met .",
    "it is worth noting that in @xcite and @xcite , the authors considered the problem of minimizing the mean squared error ( mse ) in ics to indirectly minimize the error rate . although mse is a meaningful criterion in practice , minimizing the mses in ics does not necessarily lead to the error probability minimization .",
    "moreover , @xcite has studied the error performance for ics based on ia .",
    "however , it is restricted only to the case of three - user ics with at least two antennas at each node , in which each of the three user links can achieve at least one dof .",
    "in contrast to the above prior work , in this paper , we study the problem of minimizing the users symbol error rates ( sers ) directly in the @xmath0-user single - input single - output ( siso ) ic by applying improper signaling over finite signal constellations .",
    "we are motivated by the results that igs can provide rate gains for ics over the conventional pgs @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is thus expected that the additional degrees of freedom provided by improper signaling can also be exploited to improve the ser performance in ics , even with practical ( non - gaussian ) modulation schemes .",
    "our study is also related to the classic problem of constellation design in digital communication .",
    "for additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , the design and analysis for various digital modulation schemes can be found in the early investigation ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . the error probability for fading channels",
    "was studied in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the work @xcite reported an important representation of the q - function for gaussian distribution , which has been widely used in subsequent works on the error rate analysis for digital modulation .",
    "more information on the constellation design for awgn and fading channels can be found in the classic book @xcite . with the introduction of multiple antennas ,",
    "the constellation design for multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channels has attracted significant attention .",
    "some notable results can be found in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , there has been considerably less studies on the constellation design and error rate analysis for ics .    in this paper , we investigate the @xmath0-user ic with fixed signal modulations and data rates of the users .",
    "different from the conventional setup where proper signaling is assumed , here we employ improper signaling to improve the error performance in ics .",
    "we first derive the pair - wise error probability ( pep ) of erroneously decoding one user s symbol to another , and formulate the precoding optimization problems to minimize the tranmission error probability according to two criteria , i.e. , pep and ser . based on these results ,",
    "two improper signalling schemes are proposed to minimize the maximum pep and ser of all users , respectively .",
    "numerical results show that an improved error rate performance can be achieved by the proposed schemes over conventional proper signaling as well as other state - of - the - art improper signaling designs , under both awgn channel and practical cellular system setups .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system model ] describes the @xmath0-user siso ic model and introduces improper signaling . in sections [ sec : min max pep ] and [ sec : min ser upper - bound ] , we present our new approaches to directly minimize the maximum pep and ser of users in ic with two proposed algorithms , respectively .",
