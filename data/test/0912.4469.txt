    "there is current interest ( see , for instance , refs . ) in studying inverse transitions , melting or freezing , motivated by the quite unconventional situation present in such transitions in which the ordered phase is more entropic than the disordered one @xcite .",
    "this apparent counter - intuitive transition has become even more interesting since there are now various physical systems displaying this kind of transition , as for example , magnetic films @xcite and , particularly , high-@xmath0 superconductors @xcite .",
    "therefore , the knowledge about which conditions are necessary for the existence of inverse transitions is a challenging issue @xcite .    among the proposed classical magnetic models which can show inverse transitions , the blume capel ( bc ) @xcite and the gathak - sherrington ( gs ) @xcite models can be useful to clarify what would be such conditions . for instance",
    ", the phase diagram of the bc model @xcite displays inverse melting with a phase transition from the ferromagnetic ( @xmath1 ) phase to the paramagnetic ( @xmath2 ) one when the temperature is decreased . however , in order to obtain inverse melting in the bc model , it is strictly necessary to impose in the problem the entropic advantage of the interacting state through parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the degeneracy of @xmath6 and @xmath7 spins states , respectively @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the bc model , the gs model @xcite - which is similar to the the bc model except that it has the spins couplings given as random gaussian variables - shows naturally inverse freezing .",
    "in other words , there is a reentrant first order boundary phase separating the spin glass ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath2 phases .",
    "however , there is no need of any entropic advantage of interacting states @xcite .",
    "the previous discussion suggests that the randomness is responsible for producing naturally inverse freezing in the gs model as compared with the inverse melting case in the bc model .",
    "in fact , to be more precise , it seems that the presence of non - trivial form of randomness , which means frustration , @xcite would be the essential ingredient which allows inverse freezing in the gs model with no need of entropic advantage . that sets some questions : what is the actual role of non - trivial randomness to produce naturally inverse freezing ?",
    "is this natural inverse freezing robust when the level of frustration is diminished",
    "? can models with trivial randomness present naturally inverse transitions ?",
    "the purpose of the present work is to investigate what is the actual role of frustration as a basic condition to produce naturally inverse freezing .",
    "that could be achieved by comparing two distinct situations , the trivial randomness and the highly frustrated regime and also studying how natural inverse freezing would be affected when the level of frustration is varied .",
    "therefore , the problem is not only to find a random magnetic model which presents naturally inverse freezing , but also to get one which allows the level of frustration to vary .",
    "quite recently , the fermionic ising spin - glass ( fisg ) model @xcite has been proposed as a model able to display naturally inverse freezing in a phase diagram temperature _ versus _ the chemical potential @xmath9 .",
    "this model has the spin operators @xmath10 given as bilinear combinations of creation and destruction fermionic operators which have four eigenstates , two of them non - magnetic @xcite .",
    "the spin - spin coupling @xmath11 , likewise the gs model , is a random variable which follows a gaussian distribution .",
    "indeed , the existence of inverse freezing in this model could be expected since there is a close relationship between the gs and the fisg models @xcite .",
    "for instance , the partition function of these two models can be related by a mapping between the anisotropy constant @xmath12 of the gs model and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the fisg model is also useful to examine how quantum effects , included by the presence of a transverse field @xmath13 @xcite can affect inverse freezing . in ref .",
    ", it has been shown that , when @xmath13 is increased , the reentrance in the @xmath14 first order boundary phase in the phase diagram temperature @xmath15 _ versus _ the chemical potential @xmath9 gradually disappears .",
    "this scenario also suggests that @xmath13 in the fisg model plays the opposite role of the rather artificial parameter @xmath16 in the bc model discussed in ref . . nevertheless , the fisg model , in its original form with gaussian random couplings , is a strongly frustrated model .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to investigate in this model how the change of the level of frustration could affect the inverse freezing",
    ".    an alternative route to accomplish the previously mentioned investigation would be to use the fisg model in a version in which one could adjust the level of frustration . in that sense",
    ", the classical hopfield spin glass @xcite can be quite useful . in this model , the interactions @xmath11 between classical ising spins are given below : @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 or @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the number of sites ) are independent random distributed variables .",
    "this type of interaction has been intensively used to study complex systems @xcite .",
    "there are clearly two extreme cases for the classical hopfield ising spin glass model .",
    "when @xmath22 , it becomes the mattis model @xcite , which is a well known example of trivial randomness @xcite .",
    "the second one is when @xmath23 . in that limit",
    ", the thermodynamics corresponds to the strongly frustrated regime given by a random gaussian distributed @xmath11 @xcite . in particular , the replica symmetric mean field solution of the classical hopfield spin glass model @xcite can provide a useful method for the purposes of the present work .",
    "it is described in terms of two order parameters , the usual spin glass @xmath24 and @xmath25 which indicates the presence of mattis states that have a thermodynamics similar to the usual ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "most important , there is a parameter called here degree of frustration , @xmath26 which allows controlling the level of frustration in the theory .",
    "it is important to remark that there is a particular value @xmath27 which for @xmath28 the effects of frustration are dominant @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "it is possible to interpolate the thermodynamics from the trivial randomness ( @xmath29 ) to the strongly frustrated regime ( @xmath28 ) .    therefore , to answer the questions arisen previously",
    ", we use the hopfield fermionic ising spin glass ( hfisg ) model . in this case , the spin operators @xmath30 are defined as the fisg model , but the random spin coupling @xmath11 is given as eq .",
    "( [ hebb ] ) .",
    "the partition function is obtained in the functional integral formalism using grassmann fields where the disorder is treated with the replica method @xcite .",
    "the problem can be reduced to a one - site problem by using a similar procedure to solve the classical hopfield spin glass @xcite within the static approximation ( sa ) @xcite and one - step replica symmetry breaking ( 1s - rsb ) @xcite .",
    "it should be remarked that in the hfisg model , as the fisg one @xcite , the replica diagonal component of the sg order parameter @xmath31 appears as an additional order parameter to be solved with the others .",
    "particularly , this order parameter represents the spin self - interaction that has an imaginary time dependence for quantum sg models @xcite .",
    "however , the spin operators @xmath32 commute with the hamiltonian operators for the present hfisg model .",
    "consequently , the @xmath31 has no dynamic , which means that the sa is exact in the present work@xcite .",
    "one important point in the present work is how to locate first order boundaries phases found for different degrees of frustration .",
    "the criterion adopted here follows closely that one suggested in ref . for the classical @xmath33 model .",
    "hence , we selected , from the set of spin glass solutions in the transition , that one which meets continuously with the spin glass solution for small value of the chemical potential @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , that corresponds to the largest spin glass order parameter which gives the lowest grand canonical potential ( see also the discussion in ref . ) .",
    "then , by equating the grand canonical potential of the spin glass and paramagnetic solutions , the first order boundary phase is located .",
    "the use of the 1s - rsb scheme also deserves some remarks since our main interest is to obtain boundaries of phase transitions .",
    "it has been found in previous works @xcite that the use of the replica breaking symmetry ( rsb ) schemes in gs or fisg models essentially preserves the reentrance in the @xmath14 first order boundary phase associated to the inverse freezing .",
    "there are only small differences which appear mainly at very low temperatures .",
    "even so , for the hfisg model , we decided to use 1s - rsb scheme to check for intermedianted values of @xmath34 whether or not these differences will remain unimportant .",
    "moreover , we also analyzed the stability of the rs solutions for a sake of completeness of the work .",
    "this paper is structured as follow : in section 2 , we derived the thermodynamics and the set of coupled equations for the saddle point order parameters . in section 3 , phase diagrams temperature _ versus _ the chemical potential are presented for several values of @xmath34 . the entropy behavior as function of temperature and the grand canonical potential as function of chemical potential",
