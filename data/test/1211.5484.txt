    "since strogatz and watts @xcite found the small - world effect and barabsi and albert @xcite found the scale - free property of the world wide web , researches on complex networks have greatly increased .",
    "these pioneering efforts sought to find some universal principles and invariants , but when people encounter a specific complex network , some questions often arise : `` can we identify the most important nodes in the network?'';``are these nodes more important than other nodes ? '' etc .. these problems are related to data analysis of complex networks . in this field ,",
    "the node importance is a foundational problem . only when we know how to measure the importance of nodes , can we answer the questions mentioned above .",
    "the problem of the node importance appears in various fields .",
    "for example , studies of the most important scientists@xcite , the most dangerous terrorists@xcite , the most critical proteins or genes@xcite , etc .. in some circumstances , we may also need to know the relative important scientists , the relative dangerous terrorists , the relative critical proteins , etc .. besides , even if some real - world complex networks are not very large and with the help of computer visualization technologies , people can not yet understand their holistic features .",
    "for example , the internet@xcite . we need to find some subnetworks which are combined with some special nodes to obtain holistic understanding of the whole network@xcite .",
    "`` the importance of nodes '' is a vague concept , although many academic papers use it to describe the properties of networks .",
    "researchers have reached little consensus on this concept , but fortunately most concede that it can indeed be described by some rules or the intuitive ideas . as a reference , studies of social networks , which are certainly regarded as a kind of complex networks , inspired us . in the field of social networks ,",
    "the importance of nodes is related to `` centrality''@xcite .",
    "moreover , in the field of web search engines , the importance of nodes often relies on the importance of neighborhoods , such as in pagerank@xcite and hits@xcite .",
    "some papers also propose new ideas on the definition of importance , such as the failure of system owing to the deletion of one node@xcite .",
    "considering that all these definitions are very different , when people deal with some specific applications , they may choose a subset of these definitions .",
    "based on the investigations on these definitions , we suggest that a set of four rules can be used to characterize the node importance in common circumstances .",
    "of course , the rules can be inserted or removed as needed to accommodate the particular real world situations .",
    "however , these rules often conflict to the others .",
    "we need a solution to resolve the conflicts .",
    "mathematically , each of the four rules defines an order relationship on the importance of nodes .",
    "for example , if we define the important nodes as those with more neighbors ( larger degree value ) then the degree value actually is a measure of the node importance . because the node importance needs more than one rule to characterize , when we have characterized the concept and chosen corresponding rules and formulas",
    ", we need to focus on how to deal with the conflicts among these order relationships and aggregate the results of the rules .",
    "usually , the aggregation should not have bias on any rule .",
    "there are two relative works on the aggregation . in the field of web search engines",
    ", people use a smart method named `` rank aggregation''@xcite to deal with this problem . in another way ,",
    "if we treat every rule as an optimization object , this problem can be transferred to a multi - objective optimization problem . in the field of evolutionary algorithms for multi - objective optimization problems ,",
    "this is commonly tackled with a mathematical tool , called the dominance relationship .",
    "the dominance relationship can categorize the nodes into the equivalence classes .",
    "every equivalence class will indicate the same ordinal number of the nodes in it .",
    "the first equivalence class would only include the most important nodes , which are also called `` the skyline''@xcite in the field of database management system ( dbms ) and `` the pareto front''@xcite in the field of evolutionary computation .",
    "here we suggest that the equivalence classes can be used to resolve the conflicts among the indicators based on the following reasons : 1 ) this approach has no bias on any rule ; 2 ) this approach can obtain diverse and representative important nodes ; 3 ) this approach can guarantee that a good node would certainly have a good ordinal , which is very important to the explanation of the ordered results ; 4 ) this approach has a mathematical foundation , i.e. , it is related to the maximum vector problem@xcite ; 5 ) this approach has been used in various fields , such as dbms and evolutionary computation .    because pagerank and hits are very successful in web searching",
    ", some researchers believe that they will perform well in ranking the nodes of complex networks and then use them as benchmark algorithms to measure the effectiveness of the other algorithms @xcite , but whether they can perform well or not when applying them for very different purposes has not been discussed before . though pagerank and hits are perfect under their assumptions , the impossibility theorems restrict their extensions@xcite , so that they can not be taken for granted as benchmarks .",
    "assume that we set the intuitive rules as the benchmark , thus , are the results of pagerank and hits similar to the rules of the node importance here ?",
    "considering that both the results of the rules and the results of these algorithms can be represented as sequences , we suggest the kendall s @xmath0@xcite as the measure indicator .",
    "based on this idea , we define a measure indicator and three sub - indicators , and introduce an algorithm to calculate them . these sub - indicators can be regarded as the effectiveness of the ranking algorithms relative to the framework .",
    "to validate our ideas , we chose three well - known real - world networks , i.e. , the metabolic network@xcite , the dolphins network@xcite and the zachary karate club network@xcite as the examples to carry out the experiments .",
    "the experimental results show that the framework can produce representative and diverse nodes .",
    "moreover , we also calculate the effectiveness measure sub - indicators .",
    "the experimental results show that pagerank and hits perform well even though they were not designed for the undirected networks .",
    "however , the results also show that both algorithms have bias .    in general , our work tries to provide a framework for issues on ranking / sorting the node importance .",
    "this framework addresses three main issues .",
    "first , how to reasonably define the node importance ?",
    "our solution is to clarify the concept of the node importance from the intuition by analyzing the concept with rules that define every aspect of this concept respectively .",
    "second , how to resolve conflicts among rules ?",
    "our solution is to aggregate the results of the rules by importing a mathematical tool that categorizes them into the equivalence classes and then assemble them into a partially ordered sequence .",
    "third , how to measure the effectiveness of the compared algorithms ?",
    "our solution is to compute the similarity between the results of the framework and that of the compared algorithm .",
    "we uses three widely used networks to validate the approach .",
    "finally , we apply the proposed approach to analyze the structure of the internet .",
    "the importance of nodes is related to many fields , and it is currently attracting more and more interests .",
    "the evaluation of the node importance is based on the researches in graph theory and graph - based data mining@xcite , and we can say that this field can be regarded as a branch of graph - based data mining .",
    "however , research on the node importance origins from the study of social networks . after the emergence of complex networks , other applications in technical networks , biological networks , etc . were also proposed .    to clarify the node importance",
    ", we need to solve three main problems .",
    "the first one is that what are the suitable rules to define the node importance .",
    "the second one is how to resolve the conflicts among all the rules .",
    "the third one is how to measure the effectiveness .",
    "the importance of nodes was discussed in social networks as `` centrality '' . before the work of freeman , there is no unanimity on what is `` centrality '' and what is the conceptual foundation of `` centrality '' ; of course , there is no unanimity on what is the proper measure of `` centrality''@xcite .    in 1976",
    ", freeman reviewed the measure of `` centrality''@xcite and suggested three measure indicators for point ( node ) centrality .",
    "first , `` degree '' is a proper measure , it can be used to measure the communication activity in a network .",
    "second , `` betweenness '' is based upon the frequency with which a node falls between pairs of other nodes on the shortest or geodesic paths connecting them , and is used to exhibit a potential for control of the communication .",
    "third , `` closeness '' is based upon the degree to which a node is close ( approximates ) to all other nodes in the network and is used to exhibit the independence or efficiency of communication .",
    "these three measure indicators are referenced as three different structural attributes .",
    "the work of freeman has achieved a great success .",
    "many researchers use the `` centrality '' under freeman s suggestion now .",
    "the importance of nodes was defined recursively in pagerank and hits when dealing with the web documents , that is , the importance of a node relies on the importance of neighbors , and the neighbors relies on neighbors neighbors , etc .. essentially , the importance of nodes is related to the degree of nodes .",
    "based on this idea , pagerank and hits need to iteratively calculate the node importance . however , both these algorithms were designed to deal with directed graphs . because this paper mainly focuses on undirected graphs ,",
    "the undirected vertex are treated as a couple of vertexes with opposite directions to make both the algorithms feasible .",
    "the importance of nodes also was defined as the failure of system@xcite .",
    "if a node is removed from a connected graph , and the new graph is not connected , then this node is important .",
    "actually , literature@xcite and the related papers emphasize on the importance of node sets . for a single node ,",
    "this definition may include less information because the nodes mostly do not break the network only by itself .",
    "moreover , this definition can be partially represented by the betweenness .",
    "moreover , when considering the spreading process on complex networks , the k - shell@xcite can be used to define the most central , or the most important nodes .",
    "notice that this paper focuses on the static structure , the k - shell and the importance definition on failure@xcite are not applicable .",
    "moreover , the definitions of pagerank and hits can be represented as the neighborhood importance , therefore , four rules among these definitions are suggested to measure the node importance .",
    "if we regard every rule as an optimization object , the problem how to resolve the conflict among the rules could be transferred to a multi - objective optimization problem . in the field of multi - objective optimization",
    ", the simplest way is to set weights@xcite , which reflects the users preference for every rule .",
    "because the weights in the weighted sum method are uncertain , this method can not be used for a benchmark purpose .",
    "maybe we can refer to a smart technology named `` rank aggregation''@xcite in web search engine .",
    "the aim of the rank aggregation is to obtain a sequence which has a minimal distance to all ranking results from different measure indicators or ranking algorithms .",
    "if we use this method , that means we actually assume that the sequence with minimal distance would be most satisfactory to the definition of the node importance .",
    "this assumption is not necessary .",
    "moreover , this method would not guarantee that the good node has a good ordinal .",
    "for example , if node @xmath1 is more important than node @xmath2 under all the rules , the rank aggregation may set that node @xmath2 is more important than node @xmath1 to minimize the distance .",
    "in the field of multi - objective optimization , `` dominance relationship '' is used to deal with the conflicts@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the weighted sum method , this method does not need parameters , and moreover , it is not sensitive to the small difference of scores of nodes , because it is based on order relationships .",
    "this method can keep the diversity to obtain representative important nodes .",
    "for example , the best node under every rule should certainly be regarded as one of the most important nodes .",
    "furthermore , when using it as a benchmark , if node @xmath1 is better than node @xmath2 in all aspects , node @xmath1 would certainly be more important than node @xmath2 .",
    "this feature is useful for a reasonable explanation .",
    "moreover , the concept of `` pareto front '' is used to describe the set of `` the most important nodes '' .",
    "cotta and merolo@xcite referred to the work of scientific collaboration network @xcite and computed the degree , the betweenness and the closeness of the scholars majoring in evolutionary computation and obtained interesting results .",
    "they also listed the `` pareto front''the most important scholars . in this paper",
    ", we extend this method and used it as a good benchmark , and formally describe the detailed mechanism and introduce how to pack the results into a sequence and how to compare to other algorithms .      when we have obtained the results from the benchmark and compared algorithm , how to define the effectiveness measure indicator(s ) is an important problem . because both the results can be expressed as the sequences , the effectiveness actually is the `` distance '' between two sequences .",
    "two popular measures are related to this issue : the spearman s @xmath3 and the kendall s @xmath0@xcite .",
    "kendall s @xmath0 is based on such an idea : how many times to transfer a sequence to the other by neighbor swapping .",
    "when applying kendall s @xmath0 to compute the effectiveness , the compared algorithms can `` cheat '' the measure indicator by generating too many equivalent nodes , so we use two sub - indicators to bound it and a sub - indicator to indicate the degree of `` cheating '' .    here , we have introduced the problems , then we will introduce more detailed information on the solutions in the next subsections .",
    "people reached little consensus on the concept of `` the importance of nodes '' , but most concede that the node importance can be described by intuitive ideas .",
    "for example , `` degree '' is used as a measure indicator for the communication activity in human communication .",
    "a person with more social relationships is treated as more important ; and in a pure network , from one aspect , the nodes with larger degree are regarded as more important .",
    "this description on the node importance in networks is obviously based on intuition .",
    "therefore , when we discuss the node importance , we must extract the formal representation from the intuition .",
    "we choose four rules to evaluate the node importance according to the existing researches .    1 .   1 : commonly , the nodes with larger degree would have a larger influence on the network , so we think that the nodes with larger degree are more important . that is , if the degree of node @xmath1 is larger than that of node @xmath2 , then node @xmath1 is more important than node @xmath2 .",
    "2 .   2 : if a node connects two or more communities , it is a key node , because this node can control the communication between the communities .",
    "we know , the potential of controlling the communication can be measured by betweenness .",
    "as such , if the betweenness of node @xmath1 is larger than that of node @xmath2 , then node @xmath1 is more important than node @xmath2 .",
    "3 .   3 : if a node is closer to `` the center '' of the network , it is more important . because closeness is the proper indicator , we have , if the closeness of node @xmath1 is larger than that of node @xmath2 , then node @xmath1 is more important than node @xmath2 .",
    "4 .   4 : if a node has neighbors with larger influence , then this node is more important",
    ". that is , if the neighbors of node @xmath1 have larger influence than that of node @xmath2 , then node @xmath1 is more important than node @xmath2 .",
    "the intuition of rules 1 , 2 and 3 come from the field of social networks , and the intuition of rule 4 from the web search engine .",
    "though we list four rules to describe the concept of the node importance , mathematical formalization still is necessary .",
    "we denote `` the importance of node @xmath1 is greater than that of node @xmath2 '' as @xmath4 , and `` the importance of node @xmath1 equals that of node @xmath2 '' as @xmath5 .    according to the definitions above , the rules can be formalized as follows ,    rule 1 involves the degree as the measure indicator .",
    "we note the degree of node @xmath1 as @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 where ,    @xmath8    rule 2 can be measured by betweenness , @xmath9 would represent the betweenness of node @xmath1 and is defined as follows ,    assume that @xmath10 is the number of shortest paths ( geodesic paths ) between node @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and have @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the number of shortest paths between node @xmath11 and @xmath12 and through the node @xmath1 .",
    "then we have ,    @xmath15    rule 3 actually is based upon the closeness , we use @xmath16 to represent the closeness measure of node @xmath1 , @xmath17 to represent the length of the shortest paths between node @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath18 to represent the set of all nodes in the network .",
    "then we have ,    @xmath19    as to rule 4 , we use a function of degrees of the neighbors of the node to measure it .",
    "we use @xmath20 to represent the set of the immediate neighbors of node @xmath1 , that is , all elements in @xmath20 would have and only have a hop / transimition from node @xmath1 .",
    "and we suggest such a function , @xmath21{{\\sum\\limits_{i \\in nb(a ) } { degree(i)^{nk } } } } \\ ] ] if @xmath22 then the neighboring nodes with larger degree would contribute more to the value of this indicator , but this may make a dilemma that the nodes with larger degree may be inferior to its neighbors with larger degree under this rule . for example",
    ", when the network structure is a star or a wheel , the central nodes would have an inferior indicator value . and v.s .",
    ", if @xmath23 , then the neighboring nodes with larger degree would contribute less , which is unfair , unless for some specific purposes .",
    "so we suggest @xmath24 .",
    "based on the definitions above , the rules would be depicted as follows ,    1 .",
    "1:@xmath25 2 .",
    "2:@xmath26 3 .",
    "3:@xmath27 4 .",
    "4:@xmath28 5 .",
    "5:@xmath29      four rules tell us the order relationships under different measure aspects . because they may be conflicting , we need a method to aggregate their results . here",
    "we employ a kind of strict partial order relationship called dominance relationship to order the nodes .",
    "for an illustration , we assume only two rules 1,2 and three nodes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath30 .",
    "assume that under rule 1 , @xmath31 ; and under rule 2 , @xmath32 ; then , for rule 1 , we set values of @xmath1 , @xmath30 , @xmath2 as 1 , 2 , 3 ; for rule 2 , we set values of @xmath30 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 as 1 , 2 , 3 .",
    "so @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath30 would have coordinates @xmath33 . here , smaller number represents more importance .",
    "[ fig.ranking.sketch ] .",
    "+    because node @xmath1 is more important than @xmath2 for rule 1 and rule 2 , so we say node @xmath1 * _ dominates _ * node @xmath2 or , @xmath2 * _ is dominated _ * by node @xmath1 . obviously , @xmath1 and @xmath30 are not dominated by any other nodes , so we say they rank 1 . if we erase all non - dominated nodes , that is , node @xmath1 and node @xmath30 , from fig .",
    "[ fig.ranking.sketch ] , then node @xmath2 would not be dominated by any other nodes , so we say node @xmath2 ranks 2 .    for each node",
    ", it is assigned four values to represent the ordinals under the corresponding rules .",
    "that is , the node importance can be represented by a vector with four elements . for node @xmath1 ,",
    "we denote @xmath34 , here @xmath35 represents the ordinal value under rule 1 , @xmath36 represents the ordinal value under rule 2 and so on .",
    "therefore , rule 1 to rule 4 can be rewritten as follows ,    1 .",
    "1:@xmath37 2 .",
    "2:@xmath38 3 .",
    "3:@xmath39 4 .",
    "4:@xmath40    according to the rules , the set of the importance vector of all nodes is a strict partial order set based on the dominance relationship and satisfies the irreflexive , transitive , asymmetric relationships .",
    "because the dominance relationships are a kind of strict partial order relationship , and a strict partial order relationship should respond to a non - strict partial order relationship '' over a set which is reflexive , antisymmetric , and transitive ; a strict partial order relationship `` @xmath41 '' is a binary relation over a set which is irreflexive and transitive , and therefore asymmetric . ] . under the non - strict partial order relationship",
    ", the nodes can be packed into the equivalence classes , that is , all the nodes in the same equivalence class are equivalent in certain relationship .",
    "we give formal definition for the dominance relationship below ,    given node @xmath1 and node @xmath2 , @xmath42 ( m is the number of the selected rules ) is said to dominate @xmath43 ( denoted by @xmath44 ) , if and only if @xmath1 is less than or equivalent to @xmath2 for each element and @xmath45 , i.e. + @xmath46    given a set a , the non - dominated set ( denoted as nds ) is the set that contains all the nodes which are not dominated by any other nodes .",
    "mathematically , _ nds _ is defined as : @xmath47    here nds is `` the pareto front '' , or `` the skyline set''@xcite .",
    "mathematically , nds is the maxima of a set of vectors@xcite .    given a set a , the elements in @xmath48 would rank 1 .",
    "@xmath49 is the dominated set , and if it is not empty , it would have its nds , all the elements in @xmath49 s nds would rank 2 .",
    "every nds in different hierarchies is an equivalence class .",
    "when we set the ordinal to every node , we can categorize all the nodes into the equivalence classes based on iterative non - dominated sets , and every equivalence class means a ranking number .",
    "therefore , the procedure to rank the nodes by the importance actually is the procedure to iteratively obtain the non - dominated set from the remaining set which has eliminated the non - dominated nodes .",
    "once we determine the measure indicators of the importance , then we have determined the results of the equivalence classes based on the dominance relationship , that is , the iterative non - dominated sets .",
    "so we need an algorithm to compute the equivalence classes .    in the field of dbms ,",
    "several algorithms have been proposed to compute the skyline set efficiently . for examples , block - nested - loops algorithm , divide - and - conquer algorithm and b - tree algorithm proposed by brzsnyi et al.@xcite , the progressive skyline algorithms proposed by tan et al.@xcite and the online algorithm proposed by kossmann et al.@xcite .",
    "these algorithms can also be used to compute the equivalence classes efficiently by iteratively computing the skyline set .",
    "here we just introduce a simple algorithm , regardless of efficiency , to categorize the nodes into the equivalence classes .",
    "assume that the input is a set named @xmath50 , we define a set named @xmath48 to store the non - dominated nodes , and a set named @xmath51 to store dominated nodes in current iteration step .",
    "when an iteration step is executed , the equivalence classes and the rank numbers of the equivalence classes can be output step by step .",
    "the pseudocode of this algorithm is depicted as fig .",
    "[ fig.pseudocode.ec ] .",
    "+      once the rules are determined , the nodes could be categorized into the equivalence classes by their importance .",
    "the nodes in the same equivalence class will share the same rank number , so all the nodes could be packed into a partially ordered sequence .",
    "but the further problem would be , because several algorithms have been used to sort / rank the nodes by the importance , how to measure the effectiveness of algorithms ?",
    "i.e. , how to measure the similarity between the aggregation of the results of the selected rules from intuition and the results of the ranking algorithms ?    pagerank@xcite and hits@xcite are the most famous algorithms and they were designed to automatically determine the importance of web pages . here",
    "we use them for the analysis of complex networks like the previous works@xcite , and we try to investigate how much pagerank and hits are similar to the equivalence classes approach .",
    "pagerank and hits are the `` global ranking / sorting '' , that is , it will generate a totally ordered sequence .",
    "a totally ordered sequence means that every element in this sequence can be ordered by a property and has an identical ordinal .",
    "because both the results of the rules and the results of the compared algorithm can be expressed as sequences , we can use the distance between the partially ordered sequence generated by the equivalence classes approach and the totally ordered sequence generated by the compared algorithms to measure the effectiveness of the algorithms .",
    "if we use the partially ordered sequence as a benchmark for comparison , every opposition to the partially ordered sequence is regarded as a unit of distance . according to this idea",
    ", the distance can be defined .",
    "actually , the distance is an indicator of the similarity . when we know the maximum of distance , we can define the similarity ratio .",
    "we use the term `` coverage '' to represent the similarity ratio .",
    "we use a short example to illustrate the concept of coverage .",
    "assume that there is a partially ordered sequence , denoted as @xmath52,[3,4]\\}$ ] which means @xmath53 is an equivalence class , and @xmath54 is another , and a totally ordered sequence , @xmath55 which means @xmath56 .",
    "then how to measure the distance between two sequences ?",
    "we use the counting of swapping between the neighboring nodes to define the distance , that is , how many times we swap the neighbors to transfer the totally ordered sequence to meet the partially ordered sequence , the least number of actions can be defined as the distance . as to the example , we need at least 4 times , that is , @xmath57 ; therefore , the distance is 4 .",
    "actually , the distance means the violation of the order relationships to the partially ordered sequence .",
    "notice that the position relationship between @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( similar for @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) is not considered .",
    "once the distance is defined , the coverage can be defined as the opposition of the ratio of violation . as to the example , because 4 is the possible largest value for all possible totally ordered sequence , so the coverage is zero .    in many circumstances ,",
    "the algorithms would estimate some inequivalent nodes as equivalent , so we define two sub - indicators  the best and worst coverage  to evaluate the coverage in the best and worst circumstances , that is , if we want to get the worst coverage and the compared algorithms obtain a sequence @xmath62 , 1\\}$ ] , that means no .",
    "3 node equals to no .",
    "2 node , because for the partially ordered sequence , no . 2 node is prior to no .",
    "3 node , so we rewrite it as @xmath63 , 1\\}$ ] , such that the relative position of no . 2 node and no . 3 node is different from that of the partially ordered sequence , here , the coverage is the worst coverage .",
    "here we formally depicted the concept of coverage as follows ,    given two sequences @xmath64 and @xmath65 , if @xmath66 $ ] such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 and for arbitrary @xmath69 , then we say , there exists one time of neighbor swapping to transfer the sequence @xmath1 to @xmath2 , denoted @xmath70",
    ".    given two sequences @xmath1 and @xmath2 , if there exist the least k sequences @xmath71 such that @xmath72 , ns(s_j , s_{j+1})=1 \\wedge   ns(a , s_1)=1 \\wedge ns(s_k , b)=1 $ ] , then we say @xmath73 and the distance from @xmath1 to @xmath2 is @xmath74 .    a partially ordered sequence can actually be regarded as a set of sequences , so the distance between a sequence and a partially ordered sequence is the minimum distance from a sequence to a set of sequences .",
    "given a sequence @xmath1 and a sequence set @xmath50 , the distance from @xmath1 to @xmath50 is @xmath75 .    for a given network ,",
    "assume that the partially ordered sequence of the equivalence classes approach is @xmath76 , and the compared sequence is @xmath77 , and all the possible sequences of @xmath76 would construct a set denoted @xmath78 .",
    "then the coverage can be depicted as follows , @xmath79    when the sequences of the compared algorithms are totally ordered sequences , this indicator is enough to characterize the similarity between these sequences to the sequence of the equivalence classes approach . but some algorithms would generate some equivalent nodes , then , how to define the similarity ratio ?    as to the sequences with some equivalent nodes , we can regard it as a sequence set and choose the best sequence and the worst sequence in the sequence set to represent it , therefore , we define the best coverage and the worst coverage .",
    "if we regard the compared sequence with the equivalent nodes as a set of sequences ( denoted @xmath50 ) , we have the definition of two sub - indicators , best coverage and worst coverage , based on coverage as follows ,    @xmath80    notice that the best coverage does not measure the best effectiveness , because when all the nodes are in an equivalence class , the best coverage is 1 , here it is meaningless , because the worst coverage is 0 .",
    "the worst coverage is a more proper measure indicator to measure the worst effectiveness . and",
    "the gap between the best coverage and the worst coverage would mean the number of nodes which are incorrectly regarded as equivalent nodes . here",
    "we define other sub - indicator `` certainty ratio '' that are denoted as `` certratio '' to indicate the incorrect degree .",
    "if the compared algorithm can identify the equal nodes and does not regard the inequivalent nodes as equivalent , its certratio is 0 .",
    "actually , if the algorithm treats every nodes uniformly , and does not import extra information , the symmetric nodes will not be assigned different ranking values .",
    "under such an assumption , the certratio is only related to the gap between the best coverage and the worst coverage . here",
    "we define the certratio as equation [ eqn.certratio ] , which is not suitable for some special algorithms which include extra information .",
    "@xmath81      the calculation of coverage includes two steps .",
    "the first step is the calculation of the distance between @xmath77 and @xmath76 .",
