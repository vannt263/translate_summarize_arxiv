    "galaxy clusters represent the largest collapsed structures in the universe which form in the peaks of the density field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews see ) . in order to relate the observed cluster population to the density peaks seen in numerical simulations the masses of the observed clusters have to be inferred from observables .",
    "an accurate calibration of these mass - observable relations is of great importance in astrophysical studies of cluster - formation and -evolution as well as in cosmological studies using the galaxy cluster mass function .",
    "the richness of a galaxy cluster @xcite is such an observable that can easily be measured from optical / ir data out to high redshifts .",
    "the mass measurements that are required for calibration , however , become increasingly difficult at higher redshifts .",
    "the strong assumptions that are necessary to interpret x - ray ( hydrostatic equilibrium ) or velocity dispersion ( virial equilibrium ) measurements make it important to perform independent cross - checks which do not rely on the same assumptions .",
    "this is particularly important at    high-@xmath6 where clusters are dynamically younger and equilibrium assumptions become increasingly questionable .    one way to measure mass that does not rely on assumptions like hydrostatic or virial equilibrium is weak gravitational lensing ( wl ; for a comprehensive review see * ? ? ?",
    "the commonly used measurement of the shearing of galaxies breaks down for higher redshifts because the sources can not be resolved anymore and hence their ellipticities can not be measured .",
    "this is particularly true for ground - based data and lens redshifts approaching @xmath7 .",
    "those higher redshift regions are , however , of special interest for cluster astrophysics because they approach the cluster formation epoch where observational guidance is crucial . the measurements of dark energy using clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as measurements of primordial non - gaussianity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) benefit from a large redshift baseline including high-@xmath6 observations .    here",
    "we present a first measurement of the average mass of such high-@xmath6 cluster lenses based on the magnification effect of wl as proposed by @xcite .",
    "this method does not require one to resolve the sources and hence can be applied at higher redshifts . by stacking a number of clusters",
    "we can measure their average mass .",
    "the clusters are selected from the spitzer adaptation of the red - sequence cluster survey ( sparcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; whereas the background sources are selected from catalogues of the canada france hawaii telescope lensing survey ( cfhtlens ) , which are based on imaging data from the cfht legacy survey ( cfhtls ) , via the lyman - break technique .",
    "the data are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : data ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : method ] we describe the magnification method .",
    "results are reported in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] and discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] . throughout we assume a flat @xmath8cdm cosmology with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 according to @xcite .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "the cluster sample used for this analysis is drawn from the 9 deg@xmath1 xmm - lss field which is one of six fields in the 42 deg@xmath1 sparcs survey .",
    "clusters are selected as overdensities in a combined color and position space using the cluster red - sequence method developed by @xcite .",
    "sparcs uses a z@xmath12 - 3.6@xmath13 color selection which allows the detection of clusters up to redshifts as high as @xmath14 1.5 .",
    "photometric redshifts for the clusters are calculated based on the color of the cluster red - sequence and have been refined using a subsample of 33 clusters with confirmed spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "comparison with the spectroscopic sample shows that the photometric redshifts are accurate to @xmath15 @xmath16 0.1 up to @xmath14 1.4 .",
    "the richness is estimated from 3.6@xmath17 m data .",
    "since the @xmath183.6@xmath17 m color of galaxies is independent of star formation history and redshift for @xmath19 , these 3.6@xmath17 m richness estimates are equivalent to @xmath20-band ones .",
    "further details of the sparcs cluster catalogs can be found in @xcite and @xcite , and a more detailed discussion of the cluster detection algorithm can be found in @xcite .    in the following we concentrate on secure clusters ( sparcs flux @xmath21 ) .",
    "this ensures that only massive systems and no potential false positives are stacked .",
    "selecting clusters in this way leads to more massive systems at high redshift than at low redshift , but with the limited data set used here we can not afford more physical cuts ( e.g. fixed richness ) . within the overlap area between sparcs and cfhtls",
    "we find 48 moderately rich and securely detected clusters with redshifts between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    as sources we use lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) selected from catalogues of the cfhtls field w1 which overlaps with the sparcs xmm - lss field by approximately six deg@xmath1 .",
    "the optical multi - color catalogues are created from stacked images in a similar way as described in with the notable exception that the psf is brought to the same gaussian shape over the whole pointing and for all five images in the @xmath24-filters of each field .",
    "this allows more accurate color measurements which results in better photo-@xmath6 s and a more accurate lyman - break galaxy selection .",
    "details of this method will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the lbg color selection of @xmath25- , @xmath26- , and @xmath27-dropouts is identical to the one presented in with the exception that @xmath25-dropouts are only required to have @xmath28 instead of @xmath29 .",
    "this relaxed @xmath30 cut is identical to the one used by whose luminosity function measurements we use for calibration .- dropout studies , like @xcite . ]    in the following we use @xmath31 @xmath25-dropouts and @xmath32 @xmath26-dropouts .",
    "the @xmath25-dropouts are the cleanest background sample in terms of low-@xmath6 contamination and they are the lowest - redshift dropout sample detectable from the ground which results in the highest apparent brightness .",
    "the @xmath26-dropouts are fainter by @xmath33 due to their larger distance resulting in larger photometric errors .",
    "they also show larger low-@xmath6 contamination .",
    "thus , we can only safely cross - correlate them to clusters with intermediate and high redshifts - beyond the redshifts of the possible contaminants . in the following , we correct for the dilution due to contamination ( boosting the signal by @xmath34 ) whenever @xmath26-dropouts are used .",
    "the cfhtls - wide data are too shallow to select @xmath27-dropouts in significant numbers .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the lensing signal per background galaxy is generally lower for magnification - based methods than for shear - based ones .",
    "however , since magnitudes - the only requirement for magnification - are easier to measure than shapes , there are always more galaxies and in particular higher - redshift galaxies available for magnification .",
    "thus , there is a break - even redshift for each data set beyond which magnification becomes more powerful than shear because ellipticity measurements become impossible .",
    "this is the case with clusters at @xmath35 where very few galaxies with reliable shape measurements are available at redshift higher than the cluster redshift , as it is very difficult to measure shapes of galaxies with @xmath5 from ground - based data .    since the s / n is too low for a single high-@xmath6 cluster to be detected via magnification with the background samples described above we rely on stacking the signals of several clusters .",
    "in this way we can in principle estimate their average mass , a method very similar to what is usually done in galaxy - galaxy - lensing . therefore , the estimator is identical to eq .  11 in , i.e. we look for correlations in the positions of lbgs and the sparcs clusters .",
    "those positions are correlated due to the magnification - bias effect of wl .",
    "the magnification signal scales linearly with the slope of the number counts , @xmath36 .",
    "we use here should not be confused with the faint - end slope of the luminosity function which is also often called @xmath36 . ]",
    "thus , it is important to select a source population with a large @xmath37 . for the interpretation of the signal",
    ", @xmath36 needs to be measured .",
    "however , we can not use the measured @xmath36 directly because of incompleteness in our catalogue .",
    "furthermore , the incompleteness changes over the magnitude bin and so does the @xmath36 itself . in order to account for these effects we model the incompleteness as a function of magnitude by comparing the lbg number counts in the cfhtls - wide to the ones in the cfhtls - deep .",
    "we then multiply the luminosity function of the lbgs measured in of the cfhtls - deep fields is @xmath38 so that cosmic variance on the number counts is negligible . for comparison :",
    "the millennium simulation has a volume of @xmath39 . ] with this incompleteness function .",
    "next we artificially magnify the same luminosity functions for different values of the magnification @xmath17 and again multiply with the un - magnified incompleteness function .",
    "then we compare the numbers of lbgs in a chosen magnitude bin between the un - lensed and the lensed case .",
    "a linear fit to the number excess ( or depletion ) as a function of @xmath17 yields @xmath40 , the effective @xmath36 to be used in the interpretation of the measurement .",
    "the two problems of varying incompleteness and varying @xmath36 over the magnitude bin should be considered in all magnification applications . just correcting the number counts for incompleteness before measuring @xmath36 and then averaging the individual @xmath36 s of all galaxies ( assigned depending on their magnitudes ) in the magnitude bin only works if the changes of the incompleteness as well as of @xmath36 over the magnitude range are moderate .",
    "the @xmath41 s that we use here can easily differ from these naive @xmath36 estimates by @xmath42-@xmath43 .",
    "besides estimating accurate @xmath40 s it is important to cleanly separate the lenses and the sources in redshift to prevent physical cross - correlations from biasing the wl measurement . using lbgs as a background sample ( and @xmath25-dropouts in particular )",
    "has the great advantage that they represent a very clean high-@xmath6 sample and their small amount of low - redshift contaminants are very well understood @xcite . in this way we can make sure that no galaxies with redshifts comparable to the cluster redshifts are included in the background samples and that physical cross - correlation ( in contrast to magnification - induced cross - correlations ) do not play a role here .",
    "the cross - correlation signal @xmath44 is then related to the magnification @xmath17 through @xcite : @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath47 for the bright lbgs selected from the cfhtls - wide , which we use here , is always positive , so that we expect a positive cross - correlation signal .",
    "since the clusters span a range of redshifts and masses - as suggested by their richness - we can not just fit a simple cluster mass model like a singular - isothermal - sphere ( sis ) to the stacked signal and estimate the average cluster mass directly .",
    "rather we fit the wl signal with a one - parameter model which is constructed from a weighted sum of sis models for all @xmath48 clusters : @xmath49    the relative weighting between the clusters in this model takes the different redshifts @xmath50 ( and hence different lensing efficiencies and different critical densities ) as well as the different masses @xmath51 , as estimated from their richness via eq .  9 of @xcite , into account .",
    "hence the fit does not directly yield an average mass .",
    "instead the normalization of the mass - richness relation is fitted under the assumptions that the slope of this relation does not change with redshift , the redshifts for the clusters are accurate , and that the background cosmology is known .",
    "the magnification for an sis takes the form : @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the einstein radius of an sis with velocity dispersion @xmath54 ; @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the angular diameter distances from observer to source and from deflector to source , respectively .",
    "the velocity dispersion is related to the mass , @xmath57 , by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the critical density at the cluster redshift , @xmath6 , and @xmath60 is the gravitational constant . here",
    "we estimate the masses with the mass - richness relation at @xmath61 from @xcite which is based on dynamical mass estimates .",
    "a fitted @xmath62 of unity would mean that the mass - richness relation at the redshifts of our cluster is identical to the one from @xcite .",
    "the mass estimated from magnification becomes @xmath63 .    in the future",
    ", larger cluster samples will allow us to bin the clusters much more finely so that an equal weighting can be used and no external mass - observable relation is needed for proper scaling .",
    "[ fig : signal ] shows the cross - correlation signal between rich sparcs clusters in two different redshift bins and the @xmath25-dropouts with @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ; surface density @xmath66 ) and @xmath26-dropouts with @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ; surface density @xmath69 ) .",
    ", with @xmath70 being the intrinsic ellipticity dispersion . ]",
    "the mean masses of the clusters are estimated from their richness .",
    "errors on the data points represent the standard deviation between the signals for the different clusters and thus reflect poissonian noise as well as noise due to clustering of the background population and noise introduced by structures along the lines - of - sight to the clusters @xcite .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are estimated by measuring the cross - correlation signal between 1000 fake clusters placed at random positions and the background lbgs .",
    "we fit multi - sis ( see eq .  [ eq : multi_sis ] ) profiles to the combined @xmath25- and @xmath26-dropout signals for the two cluster samples in the range @xmath71 .",
    "table  [ tab : results ] summarizes the results .",
    "the wl signal is - within the large errors - consistent with the signal expected from the @xcite mass - richness relation , as indicated by the values for @xmath62 being consistent with unity . despite similar s /",
    "n the relative error of the mass is larger for the high-@xmath6 sample than for the low-@xmath6 sample .",
    "that is due to the fact that the high-@xmath6 @xmath26-dropout signal is not very well - fit by the multi - sis profile ( but still consistent within noise ) .",
    "note that we just used the _ scaling _ with richness to construct the multi - sis function and not the absolute _ normalization _ of the mass - richness relation .",
    "separate multi - sis fits to the signals of the @xmath25- and @xmath26-dropouts of a given cluster sample yield consistent results as well . in the following",

    "much deeper imaging is available which allows the selection of fainter lbgs which have negative @xmath72 .",
    "we find eight of the 48 clusters in that field .",
    "although the statistical power is limited due to the small number of clusters and the lower absolute value of @xmath72 ( somewhat compensated by the higher lbg density ) , these faint lbgs allow us to perform an important test .",
    "while the positive cross - correlations of the brighter lbgs could in principle also be caused by improper redshift separation and hence physical cross - correlations , anti - correlations can only be caused by wl .",
    "here we use faint @xmath25- and @xmath26-dropouts with @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , which correspond to parts of the lbg luminosity function where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "their surface densities are @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "as expected for a background sample with @xmath79 , we find under - densities of lbgs around the clusters .",

    "* for a full treatment of the different error terms ) .",
    "as we showed in the clustering of the faint lbgs is much weaker than the clustering of the bright lbgs . ]",
    "another useful test is to cross - correlate the clusters to a population of objects that should not show any correlation in their positions because it is closer to the observer than the clusters . for that test",
    "we select stars and measure their cross - correlation function to the clusters .",
    "we do not detect any significant cross - correlation signal for stellar samples of different limiting magnitudes .",
    "it should be noted that the stellar auto - correlation function is different from zero ( with a very low amplitude , but high significance ) so that a non - detection of a cross - correlation signal between stars and clusters is a meaningful test .    from these two tests",
    "we conclude that our measurement is robust and free of strong systematic biases",
    ". however , the current sample is two small to study more subtle systematic effects in detail .",
    "we measure the normalization of the high - redshift mass - richness relation of galaxy clusters selected from sparcs employing a novel method based on the wl magnification effect of these clusters on @xmath80 lbgs .",
    "even with a small sample of rich , high-@xmath6 clusters and optical data of modest depths we detect a magnification signal at @xmath2-@xmath3 significance which yields a measurement of this normalization ( equivalent to a measurement of the average cluster mass ) with a relative error of @xmath81 .",
    "scales as @xmath82 for data that agree within errors with the model . ]",
    "the measured normalization is in good agreement with the low-@xmath6 mass - richness relation from @xcite which is based on dynamical mass estimates .    using much deeper data on a one deg@xmath1 sub - field we detect an anti - correlation between a few high-@xmath6 sparcs clusters and faint lbgs supporting a wl origin of the signal and suggesting that the measurement on the shallower data is free of physical cross - correlations that could mimic a wl signal .",
    "the overlap area between sparcs and cfhtls is too small to subdivide the clusters into different richness bins and estimate a full mass - richness relation at high redshift .",
    "however , it is well within reach of current facilities to expand this area by an order of magnitude through either observing ir- , x - ray- , or sz - surveys with ground - based optical imaging or through targeting optical surveys such as the cfhtls with ir- or x - ray imaging from space or with sz telescopes .",
    "we would like to stress that this method represents a way to obtain mass estimates of large samples of clusters at very high redshifts that is relatively cheap in terms of telescope time .",
    "it is the only method that can realistically be applied to measure the masses of very large numbers of @xmath5 clusters to be found by future high-@xmath6 cluster surveys .",
    "concentrating on the bright part of the lbg luminosity function and probably also on the lowest redshift and hence brightest lbgs reachable from the ground ( @xmath25-dropouts ) seems the most promising route .",
