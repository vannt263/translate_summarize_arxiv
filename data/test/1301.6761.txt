    "cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) consist of a white dwarf accreting from a roche lobe filling main - sequence , slightly evolved , or brown dwarf companion . in systems where the white dwarf only has a weak or no magnetic field , an accretion disc forms around the white dwarf .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed review .    from the start of mass transfer ,",
    "cvs evolve towards shorter orbital periods , due to loss of orbital angular momentum via magnetic braking and gravitational wave radiation @xcite .",
    "a period minimum occurs when the mass of the donor becomes too low to sustain hydrogen burning , and it is driven out of thermal equilibrium , becoming partially degenerate , and no longer shrinks in response to mass loss @xcite . as the donor continues to lose mass , the orbital period increases , and the system evolves back to longer periods , with decreasing mass transfer rates .",
    "the period minimum for normal hydrogen - rich cvs is predicted theoretically to occur at @xmath36570minutes @xcite , and is observed at @xmath380minutes @xcite .",
    "there are a small number of cvs and related systems that have orbital periods below this minimum , including three confirmed cvs that have evolved donors  stars that have been stripped of most of their hydrogen by mass - transfer or prior to the onset of mass - transfer ( v485 cen , ; ei psc , @xcite ; css100603:112253@xmath4111037 , @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of the known ultracompact mass - transferring binaries belong to the small class known as the am canum venaticorum ( am cvn ) binaries .",
    "these consist of a white dwarf accreting from a hydrogen - deficient ( semi-)degenerate donor , allowing them to reach their short orbital periods ( 5 to @xmath365 minutes ; see @xcite for a recent review ) . see @xcite for further discussion of the evolution and population of systems below the cv period minimum .",
    "a subset of cvs , known as dwarf novae , shows outbursts , in which the system brightens by several magnitudes for a period of days to weeks .",
    "these outbursts are thought to be caused by thermal instabilities in the accretion disc , and have been the subject of considerable observational and theoretical study . some dwarf novae show superoutbursts in addition to the normal outbursts , these last longer and are generally brighter . during a superoutburst ,",
    "tidal interactions between the disc and the donor star cause the disc to become asymmetric .",
    "this results in periodic modulations in the lightcurve , known as superhumps ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this superhump period is typically a few percent longer than the orbital period , and is related to the mass ratio of the system ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of superhumps is discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "here we present time resolved optical spectroscopy and photometry of the helium rich cv , sbss1108 + 574 ( sdssj111126.83 + 571238.6 ) .",
    "the system was identified via a survey designed to uncover am cvn binaries in the photometric database of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "its spectrum shows unusually strong hei emission in addition to the balmer emission lines .",
    "it was discovered in outburst on 2012 april 22 by the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ; @xcite ) , and reported as a new su uma dwarf nova by @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented photometry of the outburst , and identified a possible orbital period of 55.367 minutes , in addition to superhumps .",
    "we obtained time - resolved spectroscopy of sbss1108 + 574 on 2012 february 28 and 2012 april 20 with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; @xcite ) at the gemini - north telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "we used the b600 + grating with a 1 arcsec slit .",
    "gmos has three 2048@xmath54608 e2v deep depletion ccds , which were used in six amplifier mode .",
    "the resulting spectra cover the wavelength range 41206973 , with an average dispersion of 1.85 per pixel .",
    "the observations consist of 65 spectra in total , most of which have an exposure time of 173 seconds . the observations in february were cut short after only about one half of the binary orbit , and so are insufficient to determine the orbital period of the system .",
    "a second attempt was made to complete a 3 hour observing block on 2012 april 20 , when the system was caught in an unexpected outburst ( it had not been identified as a dwarf nova prior to this outburst ) .",
    "these spectra cover approximately three binary orbits .",
    "the log of our spectroscopic observations is given in table [ t : speclog ] .",
    ".summary of our spectroscopic observations of sbss1108 + 574 . [ cols=\"<,<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     there is considerable scatter around the radial velocity curve shown in fig .",
    "[ f:4686rv ] , which is likely caused by the unusual line structure during the outburst ( see fig . [",
    "f : trail ] ) . calculating the radial velocities from the line wings using two narrower gaussians",
    "gives similar results , but the effect of the unusual structure causes greater scatter in the radial velocities , and greater errors , and so we prefer the single gaussian method .",
    "the uncertainty on the period was estimated by carrying out 10000 bootstrap selections of the radial velocity curve . for each subset ,",
    "54 radial velocities were selected from the full radial velocity curve , allowing for points to be selected more than once , and the periodogram calculated , taking the strongest peak as the period .",
    "the standard deviation of these computed periods , ignoring those that correspond to higher harmonics , is taken as a measure of the uncertainty in the derived orbital period .",
    "superhumps are caused by a resonant interaction between the accretion disc and the donor star , that causes the disc to become asymmetric .",
    "the increased viscous dissipation caused by this interaction between the donor and the distorted disc , leads to the brightness variations observed during dwarf nova superoutbursts .",
    "the observed superhump period is the beat period between the orbital period of the system and the precession period of the deformed disc @xcite .    as the superhump phenomenon is due to resonance , and the precession rate for resonant orbits",
    "depends on the mass ratio of the system , there is a strong link between the superhump period and the mass ratio .",
    "the superhump period - excess , @xmath6 is found to increase with increasing mass ratio , @xmath2 .",
    "an empirical relation is derived from eclipsing dwarf novae , in which the mass ratio and superhump excess can be measured independently @xcite .",
    "of the three alternative @xmath7  @xmath2 relations , the @xcite form , @xmath8 and the @xcite form , both assume @xmath9 when @xmath10 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption as we would expect a secondary with negligible mass to have a negligible tidal interaction with the disc .",
    "the third version of the relation , given by @xcite , does not use this assumption .",
    "the @xcite formulation is usually favoured for am cvn binaries @xcite , as observations of the only known eclipsing system , sdss j0926 + 3624 agree best with this form @xcite , and so we use that version here .",
    "the total time covered by our spectroscopic observations is not sufficiently long to reach the accuracy of the photometric periods , and so we take the weak additional signal in fig .",
    "[ f : pgram ] as the orbital period .",
    "as the superhump period varies during our observations , we conservatively take the separation of the two strongest peaks in fig .",
    "[ f : pgram ] as a measure of the uncertainty on the superhump period for calculation of the excess .",
    "this gives the superhump excess in sbss1108 + 574 , @xmath7=0.0176@xmath10.0032 , and the mass ratio , @xmath2=0.086@xmath10.014 .",
    "we note that this is very large compared to the mass ratio found for css1122@xmath41110 , @xmath2=0.017 @xcite , despite the similar orbital periods .",
    "our larger estimate for the superhump excess is consistent with the value found by @xcite for their stage b superhumps , @xmath7=0.0174@xmath10.0002 .",
    "using the smaller excess they measured for their stage c superhumps , and the @xcite form of the @xmath7 ",
    "@xmath2 relation , they derive a mass ratio @xmath2=0.06 .",
    "we note that the values we derive for @xmath2 using the @xcite form of the @xmath7 ",
    "@xmath2 relation , are consistent with the values calculated using the @xcite form . for our data",
    "the @xcite formulation gives a larger value of @xmath2 , however , this relation is calibrated using the shorter superhump periods that occur late in the superoutburst , and so likely overestimates @xmath2 for our longer periods from earlier in the superoutburst .",
    "the line profiles and trailed spectra for the strongest lines , folded on the orbital period , 55.3minutes ( 26.03cyclesd@xmath11 ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : trail ] .",
    "it is clear that there is greater flux in the redshifted line peak than the blueshifted peak ; this unexplained asymmetry is often seen in the spectra of outbursting cvs .",
    "we also note the presence of underlying absorption due to the optically thick outbursting disc , this is particularly noticeable in the hei 5875 line , and makes the s - wave difficult to discern when it crosses the line centres .",
    "an s - wave is clear in the strongest line , heii 4686 , but becomes weaker with decreasing line strength .",
    "the presence of this s - wave can be seen in the other lines shown in fig .",
    "[ f : trail ] , however , the hei lines appear to show a brighter varying signal with higher velocities than the s - wave , that is almost in anti - phase .",
    "a second varying signal is also seen in the h@xmath0 trailed spectrum .",
    "this feature is likely responsible for the strength of the second harmonic in the periodograms of these lines .",
    "there is no coherent s - wave visible in the trailed spectra when folded on these second harmonic frequencies ; thus we are confident that we have identified the correct period of this system .",
    "the corresponding doppler tomograms @xcite give a similar picture of emission in the disc .",
    "a bright spot is clearly visible in the maps for heii 4686 , h@xmath0 and h@xmath12 .",
    "the bright spot is not usually seen in cvs during outburst , as the bright outbursting disc normally outshines it .",
    "since these were calculated using the same zero phase for all lines , assumed from the heii 4686 radial velocities , hjd@xmath13=2456037.7551 , the maps may be rotated due to the unknown phase shift between our zero phase and the true zero phase of the white dwarf . note",
    "that the bright spot appears at slightly different phases in each line . the extended bright spot seen in h@xmath0 , overlaps in phase with the bright spots seen in both heii 4686 and h@xmath12 .",
    "some evidence of the bright spot may also be seen in the doppler maps of the hei lines , however , they are dominated by the brighter varying signal causing the band of increased emission in the right - hand quadrants .",
    "we note that we do not detect the presence of spiral arms in our data .",
    "spiral arms have been observed in a number of dwarf novae during outburst ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and are thought to be caused by the tidal affect of the donor on the large disc . as our observations may correspond to an early point in the evolution of the outburst , it is possible that spiral arms develop later in the outburst .",
    "the h@xmath12 line profile reveals a strong feature in the high velocity wing of the blueshifted peak , centred at about @xmath4800kms@xmath11 .",
    "the redshifted peak also extends beyond the range of the bright spot visible in the trailed spectrum .",
    "the origin of this feature is unclear , and it appears in the doppler map as a ring of emission at higher velocity than most of the disc emission .",
    "we detect no rotation between doppler maps created using only the first and only the third orbit , further verifying our identification of the orbital period .",
    "we plot the roche lobes and stream velocities for a @xmath2=0.086 binary together with the heii 4686 doppler map in fig .",
    "[ f : stream ] .",
    "= 0.086 binary .",
    "the map was rotated by applying a @xmath40.08 phase shift compared to the maps in fig .",
    "[ f : trail ] .",
    "[ f : stream],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the velocity positions of the accretor , donor and centre of mass are also shown . again , the map may be rotated about its origin due to the unknown phase shift between our assumed zero phase and the true zero phase .      the trailed spectra ( fig .",
    "[ f : trail ] ) show a slight reduction in the line flux at a phase of @xmath31 . to examine this",
    "further we construct a lightcurve of the heii 4686 ew , shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ewlc ] .",
    "this reveals a clear dip , which we attribute to an eclipse of the outer disc .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    this allows us to constrain the inclination of the system , as it must be large enough that the outer edge of the disc can be eclipsed .",
    "since there is no eclipse of the inner disc or the accretor , we can also place an upper limit on its value . using our derived value for @xmath2 , the @xcite formula for the roche lobe radius of the secondary , and the approximate tidal limit for the maximum radius of the accretion disc",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , we find @xmath14 .",
    "the outbursting disc is expected to be larger than the quiescent disc , significantly increasing the likelihood of a grazing eclipse during outburst .",
    "it is therefore likely that there will be no eclipse detectable in quiescence .",
    "the strength of the helium emission lines compared to the hydrogen lines in the average spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ f : qavspec ] and table [ t : ew ] ) , highlights the unusual nature of this system . whilst a detailed abundance analysis can not be carried out with our current data ,",
    "this is a strong indication of a much greater helium abundance than normally seen in cvs .",
    "models of accretion discs and donors in cvs and am cvns indicate that very little hydrogen is required to excite strong balmer lines , and the hydrogen abundance in sbss1108 + 574 may be significantly lower than 10 per cent .",
    "our derived period , 55.3@xmath10.8 minutes ( 26.03@xmath10.38 cycles d@xmath11 ) , is well below the cv period minimum , clearly indicating that the donor is significantly evolved , having been stripped of most of its hydrogen by mass - transfer or prior to the onset of mass - transfer .",
    "our spectroscopic period favours the weak 55.36 minute ( 26.01@xmath10.01 cycles d@xmath11 ) signal detected from the photometry and identified as the orbital period , over the 56.34 minute ( 25.56 cycles d@xmath11 ) signal identified as the superhump period .",
    "we are therefore confident that the candidate orbital period signal detected in our photometry and by @xcite , is the correct orbital period .",
    "this confirms sbss1108 + 574 as one of the shortest period cvs known , and places it well within the am cvn period range .",
    "there are three proposed formation channels for the am cvn binaries , defined by the type of donor",
    ". the donor can be ( 1 ) a second , lower mass white dwarf @xcite , ( 2 ) a semi - degenerate helium star , or ( 3 ) an evolved main - sequence star that has lost most of its hydrogen envelope .",
    "the latter is thought to form via the ` evolved cv ' channel @xcite , but this formation channel has generally been considered to be unimportant in comparison to the double white dwarf and helium star channels .",
    "@xcite , however , argue that the evolved cv channel could contribute a significant fraction of the total am cvn binary population .",
    "sbss1108 + 574 has all the characteristics of an am cvn progenitor in the evolved cv formation channel .",
    "it must be noted that not all cvs with evolved donors reaching periods below the normal period minimum , will form am cvn binaries as they are currently recognised ( yungelson et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "many systems will in fact reach their own period ` bounce ' , and evolve back towards longer orbital periods , without depleting their hydrogen sufficiently to appear as am cvn binaries .",
    "current models suggest that the fraction of evolved cv channel am cvn binaries may be lower than previously predicted ( @xcite ; yungelson et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "it is clear , however , that systems like sbss1108 + 574 and css1122@xmath41110 @xcite fall between the standard definitions of am cvn binaries and cvs .",
    "the large mass ratio we derive , @xmath2=0.086@xmath10.014 , indicates a different evolution to the standard am cvn binary population ; for gp com ( p@xmath15=46.6minutes ; @xcite ) , @xmath2=0.018 @xcite , and for v396 hya ( p@xmath15=65.1minutes ; @xcite ) , @xmath2=0.013 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the system shows outbursts indicates that the mass transfer rate is still relatively high , which is not expected for am cvn binaries that have passed @xmath16 and evolved back to long periods ( e.g.  ) .",
    "compare our estimated accretion rate , @xmath17 ( for a @xmath18 accretor ) , to the value @xcite derived for gp com , @xmath19 , and the value estimated for v396 hya , @xmath20 , again presenting a strong contrast between sbss1108 + 574 and the long period am cvn binaries .",
    "this indicates that sbss1108 + 574 is still evolving towards shorter orbital periods , becoming increasingly helium - rich .",
    "we have presented time resolved spectroscopy of the helium - rich dwarf nova sbss1108 + 574 ( sdssj1111 + 5712 ) , confirming the period detected photometrically during the 2012 april outburst .",
    "the system shows unusually strong helium emission in both outburst and quiescence , suggesting a high helium abundance .",
    "we measure the superhump period from our photometry as 56.34@xmath10.18minutes , consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic period is found to be 55.3@xmath10.8minutes , significantly below the normal period minimum ( @xmath380minutes ) , confirming the system as an ultra - compact cv containing a highly evolved donor .",
    "the relatively high accretion rate , together with the large mass ratio , suggests that sbss1108 + 574 is still evolving towards its period minimum .",
