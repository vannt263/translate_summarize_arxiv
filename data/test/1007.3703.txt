    "in addition , several earlier studies have suggested that disks around cool stars and brown dwarfs may be flatter than those around more massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , although disk models predict the opposite @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to provide a statistically robust evaluation of the hypothesis that the lowest mass stars have , on average , flatter disks than their higher mass counterparts .",
    "first , we present results from a statistical study of spitzer / irac colors of the complete census of the chamaeleon  i star - forming region .",
    "this comparison reveals a prominent difference between the color distribution of the very  low and low  mass stars in the sample .",
    "next , we use a grid of simple disk models to demonstrate that the difference in the distributions of irac colors is well explained by the lower occurrence rate of flared disks around the lowest  mass stars .",
    "these findings further reinforce the stellar  mass  dependent evolution of protoplanetary disks , a key  and yet unaccounted for  factor to consider in planet formation models .",
    "in this study we focused on the chamaeleon  i star  forming region ( cha  i , @xmath1200 known members @xcite ) , which provides an ideal set of targets .",
    "the membership of the cluster can be considered virtually complete for masses greater than @xmath116 m@xmath2 , providing an unbiased sample of roughly coeval , well ",

    "low and low  mass stars may be slightly different in cha  i , the difference is thought to be lower than the estimated age spreads for each group @xcite and therefore can be assumed coeval for the purposes of this study .",
    "we used photometric data from the spitzer space telescope @xcite obtained by the infrared array camera ( irac , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8 @xmath3 m wavelengths and the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips , * ? ? ?",

    "we use the photometric data from @xcite and 2mass @xcite with the physical parameters of the members determined by @xcite . for each source",
    "we adopted spectroscopically determined j  band extinction from @xcite and dereddened the measured magnitudes using the extinction law derived by the linear interpolation of @xmath8 from @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of comparing spectral energy distributions we calculated the flux densities in each band using zero points of the irac and mips instruments @xcite .",
    "the spectral types of the stars and brown dwarfs in our sample range from b6.5 to m9.75 @xcite .",
    "we divided these objects into two groups : a ) low  mass stars ( from g5 to m4.5 , 110 stars ) ; and , b ) very  low  mass objects ( vlmos , from m4.75 to m9.5 , 90 stars ) .",
    "the separation between the two groups corresponds to @xmath9 .",
    "we computed the irac colors for all objects as the difference between a magnitude at a short and at a longer wavelength .",

    "have evaluated irac ",
    "irac colors as disk indicators and have shown that the @xmath10-[8 ] > 0.35 $ ] criterion is efficient in discriminating between stars with and without disks .",
    "we adopt this criterion for our sample of cha  i objects leading to 78 disk  bearing and 90 diskless stars .",
    "there are 32 stars that do not have either 5.8 or 8 @xmath3 m measurements , and thus can not be classified .",
    "we find that disks in the vlmo group have bluer irac ",
    "irac colors than disks in the low  mass sample ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . to verify the statistical significance of this difference we performed a kolmogorov ",

    "irac color distributions the probability that the two samples are drawn from the same parent population are below 0.01 ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the low probabilities in all colors provide a solid proof for a different color distributions in the two groups .",

    "while the irac maps are sensitive to the photospheres of _ all _ stars and brown dwarfs in cha  i , the mips measurements are sensitivity  limited and are therefore biased .",
    "the detection limit of the mips measurements introduces a bias for the fainter vlmos : the fainter , less flared disks and/or diskless objects are often missing from the mips maps .",
    "the absence of the stars with less flared disks skews the irac ",
    "mips color distribution toward flared disks and reduces the observable difference in the irac ",
    "mips distributions of the samples . in spite of the biased mips photometry the k ",
    "s test still suggests a difference between the two samples .",
    "we also find a difference in the irac ",
    "irac color distributions of the diskless stars .",
    "the color distributions of the diskless vlmos are shifted towards redder colors , most likely due to strong molecular absorption bands in the atmospheres of the very  low  mass stars .",
    "note , however , that this shift is to the _ opposite direction _ to the one seen in the disk  bearing sample .",
    "there are three stars in our sample with irac colors consistent with pure photospheres ( @xmath10.0 mag ) , but with large [ 8]-[24 ] color ( @xmath112 mag )",
    ". these sources could be stars with transition disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for the definition ) .",
    "these stars do not alter our statistics significantly , but they are interesting for further studies .",
    "the 2mass identifiers of these stars are j11022491 - 7733357 , j11071330 - 7743498 , and j11124268 - 7722230 .    in summary , the k ",
    "s test convincingly demonstrates that the color distribution of the disks around the vlmos and low  mass stars is different : vlmos have disks with distinctly bluer irac colors .",
    "earlier studies of small disk samples have hinted on such differences , often thought to be linked to the effects of dust settling on disks @xcite .",
    "seeking an explanation for the observed color difference , in the next section we will use a grid of simple disk models to verify this explanation and explore whether other possibilities are also viable .",
    "fig . [ fig2 ] shows the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of all disk  bearing members of the low  mass and vlmo groups , normalized to their h  band flux density .",
    "the 24 @xmath3 m flux densities are not shown on this figure , because of the biased subset of the vlmo groups , as discussed in section 3 .    while the _ median _ seds of the two groups have similar shape , the _",
    "mean _ seds are different .",
    "in the case of the vlmos the medians and means of the fluxes have similar values at a given wavelength , while in the case of the low  mass sample the mean irac values are higher than the median irac values .",
    "this indicates more significant broadening of the flux density distributions towards higher fluxes than in the case of the vlmos ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the higher broadening of flux density distributions of the low  mass sample is consistent with the results of the k  s tests : the flared disk to flatter disk ratio is higher in the case of the low  mass stars than for vlmos .    for modeling the disks we will use the median sed of the unbiased low  mass sample ( including the 24 @xmath3 m wavelength ) and the median sed of the unbiased vlmo sample ( jhk and irac bands ) , with the median of the biased 24 @xmath3 m flux density as an _",
    "upper limit_. the median 24  @xmath3 m flux density of the sensitivity  limited ( and therefore biased ) vlmo sample provides an _ upper limit _ for the 24  @xmath3 m median flux of the vlmos .",
    "if the observations were not missing the fainter sources , the median 24  @xmath3 m flux density would be lower .    in order to quantitatively interpret the differences observed in the irac colors and in the distribution of the seds we used a grid of disk models with and without dust settling .",
    "we applied the radmc radiative transfer code @xcite , which can determine the vertical density structure of the disk self  consistently , assuming perfect dust  gas coupling and hydrostatic equilibrium for the gas .",
    "the radmc is complemented with raytrace , a post - processing tool to calculate the emerging sed .",
    "the primary input parameters of the radmc / raytrace codes are the temperature ( @xmath12 ) , luminosity ( @xmath13 ) , the mass ( @xmath14 ) of the central star , and the inner radius ( @xmath15 ) , outer radius ( @xmath16 ) , inclination ( @xmath17 ) , and mass ( @xmath18 ) of the disk .",
    "another key parameter of the radmc code is the number of photons used in the radiative transfer .",
    "the low photon number could cause fluctuations of the mid - plane temperature of the disk , especially at the inner 0.5 au where the near and mid  infrared radiation of the dust is coming from .",
    "the fluctuation could be reduced by a photon diffusion algorithm @xcite , but it can not be used in every case .",
    "thus , the photon number should be set carefully .",
    "the changing of the pressure scale height ( @xmath19 ) with the radius describes the disk flaring .",
    "the pressure scale height in radmc is expressed in the unit of the distance from the star ( @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the radial distance from the star ) and can be set externally .",
    "a flatter disk has a smaller @xmath20 than a flared disk at the same emitting region .",
    "we adopted the median effective temperature and bolometric luminosity of the stars of the two groups , as determined in @xcite .",

    "we kept the @xmath16 constant : in the case of the vlmo sample it was 50 au , while in the case of the low  mass sample it was 100 au .",
    "the pressure scale height was calculated by the code in 10 iteration steps .",
    "the number of photons was set to 300,000 ; this photon budget was found to be sufficient to achieve a smooth mid  plane temperature profile even in the inner regions of the disks , when using the diffusion algorithm .",
    "we calculated seds for inclinations ranging from @xmath29 to @xmath30 with @xmath31 steps .",
    "we performed a reduced @xmath32 fitting for the median seds to identify the best ",

    "the errors were calculated by @xmath33 .",

    "the fully flared models could not fit the median seds of the two groups satisfactorily within the parameter ranges of our model grid .",
    "the best  fitting model of the low  mass group overpredicts the median observed 24 @xmath3 m fluxes , suggesting that a flatter disk is required . on the other hand the model underpredicts the sed at @xmath46 and irac wavelengths , this effect likely resulting from the absence of accretion in our models . to verify this",
    "we compared the amount of @xmath47 and @xmath48 band flux excess to the @xmath47 and @xmath48 fluxes of the accretion disk models of @xcite .",
    "the amount of excess at @xmath47 and @xmath48 bands could be reproduced by models with an accretion rate of @xmath49 , a typical mass accretion rate for a few myr  old star with disk .",
    "thus , the poor fit of the shorter infrared wavelengths is likely caused by the lack of accretion in our models .",
    "fully flared disks provide an even worse fit for the vlmo group .",
    "fitting the @xmath48 and irac data points requires unrealistically low disk mass and very extreme inclinations ; on the other hand , these extreme models predict more flux at 24 @xmath3 m than the observed upper limit .    in order to verify whether dust settling and flatter disks may explain the observed disk structures , we expanded our model grid with an additional parameter .",
    "we express dust settling by allowing the pressure scale height at @xmath16 to vary between 0.01 and 0.3 .",
    "the flatter disks require more model photons : we set the number of photons to 2.5 million to ensure continuous and smooth mid  plane temperature profile . on this expanded grid the best ",
    "fit model for the low  mass sample is @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 with @xmath37 = 123.37 .",
    "fit model for the vlmos is @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 with @xmath37 = 5.89 .",
    "thus , allowing dust settling and flatter models provides much better fits and disk masses more consistent with those observed ( see fig . 8 in * ? ? ? * ) and inclinations , close to what is expected from a large sample of randomly oriented disks .",
    "fit models from this grid are shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] ( upper and lower right panels ) .",
    "our expanded grid reveals that flatter disks are a much better match to the seds than flared ones . in the case of the low  mass group , the best ",
    "fit flatter disk model ( fig .",

    "fit model fits the observations almost perfectly .",
    "there is a little deviation at the irac [ 8 ] band .",
    "this non  perfect fit is expected , because the flux density at wavelengths close to 9 @xmath3 m are strongly affected by the shape of the silicate emission feature , a parameter not varied in our models .",
    "the 24  @xmath3 m flux of the models is a sensitive proxy of the pressure scale height ( and flaring ) of the disk : a lower scale height results in a lower 24  @xmath3 m flux .",
    "thus , the upper limit of the 24  @xmath3 m flux of the vlmos translates to an _ upper limit _ on the pressure scale height .    to compare the pressure scale heights of the best ",
    "fit flatter models , we calculated the scale heights of the model disks at the radii where the observed irac and mips fluxes emerge .",
    "as a first approximation the protoplanetary disks could be described as a black body radiator with its temperature decreasing with the radius .",
    "according to wien s displacement law we calculated the temperatures of the black bodies which have the maximum of radiation at the irac and mips wavelengths and interpolated the mid - plane temperature profile of the disk to determine the radius where the radiation emerges .",
    "following @xcite we assumed a flaring angle of 2/7 and calculated the pressure scale height at these radii ( @xmath21 ) by @xmath58_{\\rm 0 } \\times ( \\frac{a}{a_{\\rm 0}})^{2/7}$ ] , where @xmath59 and @xmath60_{\\rm 0}$ ] are the outer radius and the pressure scale height at the outer radius .",

    "thus , pacs measurements could distinguish between the fully flared and flatter geometries .",
    "using colors derived from spitzer photometry , median seds , and best  fit disk models we showed that the flaring of disks around young low  mass and very  low  mass stars ( vlmos ) is statistically different and that disks around cooler stars are flatter . while previous studies by our group ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and others already hinted at such a difference , its statistical significance has not yet been verified .",
    "dust settling  a physical process that leads to flatter disks  enhances solid surface density in the disk mid  plane and is an early , important step toward planet formation .",
    "our study shows that in coeval disks this process is more efficient around lower  mass stars , an effect that has neither been predicted nor easily understood  in fact , theoretical works predict the _ opposite _ due to the lower gravity of the central star ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although developing a detailed , quantitative model explaining the stellar  mass  dependent dust settling is beyond the scope of the current paper , we venture to speculate about possible explanations of the observations . because the scale height of the fine dust is set by the dynamical coupling of dust and gas processes that lead to differences in the evolution of the gas disk , the dust disk or the dust  to  gas coupling may all lead to the observed stellar type ",
    "dependent disk structures .",
    "a lower gas surface density in disks around cooler stars may provide a straightforward explanation for lower dust equilibrium scale heights , i.e. flatter disks .",
    "this model would require that either disks around cool stars lose their gas faster or that lower - mass stars form from cloud cores with a lower  than  average gas to dust ratio .",
    "other possible explanations include a weaker turbulence in disks around lower - mass stars , leading to weaker coupling between the dust and gas components . as turbulence and viscosity",
    "also directly determines the average accretion rate through a disk , future studies may be able to find a consistent framework for connecting variations in disk structure and accretion with spectral type to systematic differences in disk viscosity . because the origin of turbulence ( and viscosity ) in protoplanetary disks is poorly understood , observations such as those presented in this paper may provide indirect clues constraining on these long - standing questions .",
    "however , more complex explanations are also possible . detailed simulations of grain - grain collisions and their impact on the overall disk structure and spectral energy distributions have been discussed in the literature extensively , including the effects of collisions , fragmentation , inward drift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "supported by laboratory studies of grain collision ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the models find a very efficient and rapid grain growth in disks on time scales shorter than the disk lifetime . indeed",
    ", most models would lead to a rapid loss of the fine due component , in stark contrast to the observed large frequency of dust disks at even 13 myr ages .",
    "this suggests that processes other than simple grain  grain collisions and fragmentation are involved in defining the grain size distribution in disks ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we also point out that the flaring disk surface is defined by a small mass fraction of the dust in the disk ; and disks around the coolest stars and brown dwarfs will be about an order of magnitude less massive than those around sun  like stars",
    ". however , the optical depths probed by infrared observations will be independent of the stellar spectral type .",
    "in addition , if the dust component is in equilibrium then the scale height of the smaller dust component will be larger than that of the larger grains .",
    "thus , the observations at the same wavelengths may probe deeper in the less massive disks around cool stars and lead to a larger deduced typical grain size and a flatter disk , even if the grain size distribution are identical in the two disks .",
    "the observed differences in disk structure is one of the first steps toward distinguishing between the interesting possibilities identified above .",
    "even more importantly , however , these results question the assertion that the initial conditions for planet formation are not stellar mass - dependent , frequently made in current planet formation models .",
    "the observed difference in the disk structure is a very important clue that joins the ranks of differences observed in disk mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , dust properties @xcite , accretion rates @xcite .",
    "most recently , statistically significant stellar  mass  dependent differences have been identified even in the organic chemistry of disks @xcite .",
    "the evidence presented here on stellar  mass  dependent disk structures completes the picture and further emphasizes the need for disk models that naturally reproduce these stellar  mass  dependent disk properties and disk evolution . only with such models we will be able to develop predictive , quantitative models for planet formation and understand the diversity of planetary systems .",
    "using spitzer / irac colors of a complete sample of coeval young stars in the cha  i star  forming regions we found that the irac colors of disks around the lower  mass and higher  mass stars are statistically different : disks around cooler stars are bluer , i.e. their seds have a less steep slope beyond 4  @xmath3 m .",

    "<S> previous studies suggest that the planet  forming disks around very  low  mass stars / brown dwarfs may be flatter than those around more massive stars , in contrast to model predictions of larger scale heights for gas  disks around lower  mass stars . </S>",
    "<S> we conducted a statistically robust study to determine whether there is evidence for stellar  mass  dependent disk structure in planet  forming disks . </S>",
    "<S> we find a statistically significant difference in the spitzer / irac color distributions of disks around very  low  </S>",
    "<S> mass and low  mass stars all belonging to the same star - forming region , the chamaeleon i star  forming region . </S>",
    "<S> we show that self consistently calculated disk models can not fit the median spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the two groups . </S>",
    "<S> these seds can be only explained by flatter disk models , consistent with the effect of dust settling in disks . </S>",
    "<S> we find that relative to the disk structure predicted for flared disks the required reduction in disk scale height is anti  correlated with the stellar mass , i.e. disks around lower  mass stars are flatter . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the initial and boundary conditions of planet formation are stellar  mass  dependent , an important finding that must be considered in planet formation models . </S>"
