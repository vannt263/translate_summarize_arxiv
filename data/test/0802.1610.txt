    "a crucial challenge for quantum information processing ( qip ) is perfectly transmitting a quantum state from one place to another as well as storing the information of a quantum state .",
    "recently , as much attentions have been paid to the solid - based quantum computing , there are many proposals for quantum state transfer and storage , using quantum spin systems as quantum data bus and quantum memory@xcite .    in other hand",
    "the heisenberg chain is a typical spin system in condensed - matter physics .",
    "it has attracted considerable attentions for a long time in describing various magnetic properties of materials . as a strong correlated systemfaddeev-87,kivshar - rmp8991,baryakhtar-94,huang - prl95,fogler - prl02",
    ", it can display rich nonlinearities induced by inter - spin interaction .",
    "the typical nonlinear phenomenon is the solitary wave , that is a wave packet propagate without either energy loss and wave packet spreading . in this sense",
    "it is quite natural to consider the role of soliton wave in quantum state transfer and quantum information storage .",
    "generally there are two major approaches to theoretically study the solitary excitation in the one - dimension ( 1d ) heisenberg chainkosevich - phr90,jtjon - prb77,fogedby - jpa80,pushkarov - pla77 , balakrishnan - prl85,rferrer - prb89,skrinjar - jph89,ghuang - prb90,daniel - pra99 .",
    "1 ) each spin is represented as a bloch vector , and a solitary excitation is found by investigating the nonlinear dynamics of this classical variablejtjon - prb77,fogedby - jpa80 .",
    "2 ) another procedure is to employ the boson mappings of spin operators via the holstein - primakoff transformation and jordan - schwinger realization@xcite . by making use of the spin - coherent - state representation",
    ", a solvable nonlinear differential equation can be deduced from the heisenberg equation for the mapping boson operators , therefore a solitary excitation is implied in the systempushkarov - pla77,balakrishnan - prl85,rferrer - prb89,skrinjar - jph89,ghuang - prb90,daniel - pra99 .",
    "our present investigation is motivated by the well known knowledge in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) that the effective spin - spin interaction can be controlled by the angle of the external applied magnetic fieldslichter-96 . here , to some extent , the inter - spin coupling can be canceled effectively by the magic angle . nowadays together with the spin echo technology , magic angle manipulation has became a necessary tool for controlling the interacting spin system to be free of decoherence due to the inter - spin couplings . in this paper , we apply a magnetic field on a n - site xxz spin chain , which is rotated around the y - axis by an amount of magnitude @xmath3 , and study how to manipulate a soliton excitation by this oblique field .",
    "it is known that the ferromagnetic order is completely determined by the direction of the external magnetic field .",
    "indeed , our investigation shows that the switch between the bright soliton and the dark soliton is controlled by @xmath3 , whose tangent is defined as the ratio between the z component and the x component of the magnetic field ; and at the turning magnitude referred to as the magic angle @xmath4 , the original anistropic chain becomes isotropic , therefore only an ideal spin wave is stimulated as an effective plane wave . here",
    ", we employ the second approach mentioned above , but go beyond the spin wave approach by considering the nonlinear effect of the collective spin excitation .",
    "generally , the spin wave approach is regarded as a mean field method with a given order parameter . due to the ignorance of the nonlinear fluctuation",
    ", the spin wave approach does not cover the quantum fluctuation in the nonlinear regime .",
    "however our approach overcomes this disadvantage .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we present our model  a heisenberg spin chain with anisotropic coupling in an oblique magnetic field .",
    "the approach we use is in sections  [ sec : quasi - c ] and  [ sec : c - fild ] . here",
    "the quasi - classical equation of motion is obtained , which is a nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation . in section",
    "[ sec : time - e ] , the time evolution of nonlinear excitations is studied .",
    "the bright soliton and dark soliton can be excited as @xmath3 shifted to the left or the right of the magic angle . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , we give a remark about the relationship between the soliton wave propagation and perfect quantum state transfer .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional xxz spin chain with @xmath0 spins in an homogeneous external magnetic field @xmath5 denote the spin operator at the @xmath6th site by pauli spin operator @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "then hamiltonian @xmath10 of this system reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total spin operator .",
    "three types of interactions are included in eq.([2 - 01 ] ) : 1 ) the isotropic part of nearest neighbor exchange interaction @xmath13 .",
    "2 ) the anisotropic part of nearest neighbor exchange interaction , which is characterized by a dimensionless parameter @xmath14 .",
    "3 ) the external homogeneous field @xmath15 , which is specified by its components @xmath16 and @xmath17 . here",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath18 , and the oblique angle @xmath19 .    obviously , the last term is proportional to the total spin @xmath20-component @xmath21 , which is conserved and thus has common eigenstates with the total hamiltonian .",
    "correspondingly , the hilbert space of the system can be decomposed into a direct sum of numerous subspaces @xmath22 specified by the total spin number @xmath23 along z - axis .",
    "it had been proved  @xcite that , on a finite simple cubic lattice , the ground state of the @xmath1 model is nondegenerate in an subspace @xmath22 . in particular , its global ground state @xmath24 is just the ground state of the model in the subspace @xmath25 when the lattice is finite , the ground state energy @xmath26 and the spin correlation function @xmath27 are analytical with respect to @xmath28 .    here",
    ", we assume that the external magnetic field is much larger than the inter - spin interaction .",
    "therefore we switch to a new `` reference frame '' with new @xmath29axis along the quantized direction of spin along the effective field @xmath15 .",

    "therefore , when the perturbation theory is applied , we diagonalize hamiltonian @xmath10 in each subspace of a given @xmath23 , which means that at lowest order , hamiltonian @xmath50 is kept .",
    "thus , the @xmath50 plays an indispensable role to govern the dynamics of the spin chain .",

    "the ground state implies a ferromagnetic order with all spins along the @xmath73 or @xmath74 direction .",
    "therefore the magnetization comes into being , which is defined as the non - vanishing average of @xmath75 .",
    "the governing equation for the nonlinear excitations on ground states can be obtained by the expanding @xmath76 to a series over the low excitation @xmath77 .",
    "we first expand ( [ hp - s+ ] ) and ( [ hp - s- ] ) , and keep the terms in the first order of @xmath78    @xmath79    consequently , beyond the spin wave approximation , the low energy effective hamiltonian ( [ h - simp ] ) is achieved as    @xmath80    where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "as we should emphasize that , the external magnetic field has been assumed @xmath84 in the above discussions . if @xmath85 , another form of holstein - primakoff transformation should be taken    @xmath86    but the main result of this paper is same .",
    "so without loss of generality , @xmath84 is assumed in the rest of this paper .",

    "the corresponding heisenberg equation    @xmath87    contains various nonlinear couplings .",
    "they lead to different nonlinear `` phases '' , which are represented by various types of soliton excitations .",
    "in this section , we make use of the continuum field theory to study the nonlinear excitations in the ferromagnetic spin chain . to this end",
    "we consider the spin wave approach with some nonlinear corrections .",
    "first let us introduce the @xmath88representation ( or call the glauber coherent state representation @xcite ) defined by the product of the multi - mode coherent states @xmath89 , where each component @xmath90 is the eigenstate of the annihilation operator @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is the coherent amplitude .",
    "since coherent states are normalized and overcompleted , the field operator sandwiched by @xmath94 can be represented only with their diagonal elements .",
    "thus , we only need to consider the diagonal part of eq .",
    "( [ operator - heisenbergeq ] ) , which are enough to describe the nonlinear dynamics without any help of off - diagonal elements .",

    "since we are looking for excitations with a length scale much larger than the lattice constant , we take the long - wave approximation , that is , the continuum field theory approach will be employed in the large @xmath0 limit . by assuming that the coherent amplitude is continuum in space ,",
    "the discrete variables @xmath97 can be replaced by a mean field @xmath98 , i.e. @xmath99 .",
    "correspondingly , the difference become the following differential @xmath100where the lattice constant is assumed to be unity . by keeping the derivation terms to the second order @xmath101 , the system of equations ( [ coherent amplitude - heisenbergeq ] ) become a field equation with self - coupling terms @xmath102 which is a typical nls equation in a constant potential @xmath103 .    to separate the rapid oscillation in the inhomogeneous nonlinear equation  ( [ nls-1 ] ) , we rewrite @xmath98 as @xmath104where @xmath105 ,",
