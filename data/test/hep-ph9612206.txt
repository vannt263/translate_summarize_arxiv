    "contrary to a widely spread prejudice that soft physics at high energies is just a boring obstacle in the way of fast progress , i want to argue that it remains of a fundamental importance , providing us with new and valuable information about the underlying dynamics of strong interactions .",
    "there are at least two basic reasons to study so called _ soft processes _ in particle physics .",
    "first of all , they represent the most fundamental challenge in qcd  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the perturbative sector ( pqcd ) , where the major theoretical problems are rather of a technical nature ( to carry out difficult , but well defined calculations ) . secondly , even if one is interested in precision pqcd tests , it is often difficult  if not impossible  to disentangle various non - perturbative effects .",
    "it is not only the unavoidable fragmentation phase , but also the presence of soft underlying events  @xcite , originating from multiple parton - parton scattering , which can mask the properties of a hard subprocess .",
    "therefore , until the nature of confinement is understood theoretically from first principles , experimental data which can shed additional light on the problem remain very important",
    ".    there exists a large variety of physics phenomena where non - perturbative qcd effects are essential . in this review",
    "three classes of such phenomena are discussed , for which new experimental results have been reported at the conference .",
    "these are : multiparticle production in , diffractive physics at hera and the transition from soft to hard scattering in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "theoretical aspects of diffraction in qcd will be discussed separately , by george sterman in his plenary talk  @xcite .",
    "in this domain information about underlying production mechanisms is extracted by studying the correlations among produced particles .",
    "a major difficulty in hadron - hadron collisions arises from the fact , that several non - perturbative effects get mixed here .",
    "therefore , hard collisions are important to study the properties of hadronization , the only non - perturbative phase in the process . the details of the fragmentation at low scale , @xmath2 can shed a light on the preconfinement stage ( i.e. the dynamics between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) followed by the recombination of quarks and antiquarks into real hadrons .",
    "@xmath4 collisions with their `` clean qcd environment '' provide the best laboratory for such kind of measurements . a typical strategy here",
    "is to calculate analytically the partonic cascade down to a scale @xmath2 and then apply a phenomenological hypothesis , like e.g. local parton - hadron duality  @xcite , to end up with observable hadron distributions which can be confronted with experimental data .",
    "when the basic properties of parton - to - hadron fragmentation are established , one can go back to a difficult case of hadron - hadron collisions , to learn more about non - perturbative dynamics there .",
    "one of the specific qcd predictions is a difference between the properties of quark and gluon initiated jets .",
    "this effect is due to the different relative probabilities for a gluon or a quark to radiate an additional gluon , given by the casimir factors @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "experiments  @xcite confirm , at least at the qualitative level , that gluon jets are `` richer '' : they have a softer and significantly broader fragmentation function and they are characterized by larger average multiplicity , as compared to quark jets . to study this effect the experiments at lep use high statistics ( few @xmath7 hadronic @xmath8 decays ) and their excellent ability to tag jet flavour ( with a typical purity of @xmath9 ) in the clean qcd environment of .",
    "especially interesting is to study the ratio @xmath10 for which analytical qcd calculations exist . from the theoretical side ,",
    "the progress over the last two decades in computing the ratio @xmath11 resulted in decreasing its value from @xmath12 in leading order qcd  @xcite to @xmath13 in higher order qcd , taking into account recoil effect in the soft gluon emission  @xcite .",
    "experiments however found lower values , concentrated around @xmath14 .",
    "a word of caution is in order here . whereas the theoretical calculations refer to the parton multiplicities originating from @xmath15 or @xmath16 states , experiments measure charged particles , applying in addition specific jet algorithms to select three jet events @xmath17 as a source of gluon jets .",
    "hence the experimental results depend upon the jet algorithm chosen  @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated  @xcite with the help of monte carlo simulations , that hadronization , when taken into account , brings the theoretical value closer to those measured experimentally . in order to eliminate a mismatch between the theoretical and experimental definitions of a gluon jet ,",
    "a new method was proposed  @xcite , based upon rare topologies of @xmath18 events , in which both quark jets appear in the same hemisphere of an event and hence are balanced by the gluon . in this case",
    "the multiplicity @xmath19 can be determined without applying a jet algorithm , just by counting the particles in the ` gluon hemisphere ' .",
    "new results presented at this conference  @xcite , are based on yet higher statistics as well as improved particle identification and flavor tagging technique .",
    "delphi has measured @xmath20 at @xmath21 gev and @xmath22 at @xmath23 gev , using a natural mixture of all quark flavours in their sample ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "opal , motivated by the fact that massless quarks are used in theoretical calculations , made a step further by separating light and heavy quarks and has shown , that @xmath25 leading to different values of @xmath26 for ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( for @xmath29 ) , at @xmath21 gev .",
    "in yet another opal analysis  @xcite a full use of all available statistics was necessary in order to exploit the new method of gary  @xcite , described above .",
    "only 221 out of @xmath30 events were selected for the final ` gluon - sample ' . as a result ,",
    "a value of @xmath31 was obtained , for the average energy of @xmath32 gev .",
    "( 78,105)(1,0 )    as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : opal ] this value is already in a very good agreement with both analytic calculations and monte carlo predictions .",
    "multiplicity distributions ( md ) , i.e. a set of probabilities , @xmath33 to produce @xmath34-particle final state , are natural and most widely used characteristics of multiparticle production .",
    "the state of the art in this field can be found in recent reviews  @xcite . in this section",
    "two questions are briefly discussed :    * do we understand the basic properties of md at least in hard scattering , taking as an example the process @xmath35 ?",
    "* is there an analogy between md in hard ( ) and predominantly soft ( @xmath36 ) collisions ?",
    "apart from well known average multiplicity , @xmath37 , and dispersion , @xmath38 , other observables are used in modern analyses of md  @xcite : factorial ( @xmath39 ) and cumulant ( @xmath40 ) moments of rank @xmath41 , and , since recently , their ratio , @xmath42 .",
    "these quantities are helpful in the mathematical description of branching processes , and they are widely used in various scientific fields to describe the properties of cascade phenomena  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the ratio @xmath43 is not only sensitive to the shape of md , but also can be calculated in higher - order pqcd .",
    "phenomenologically , the best description of the md in   is provided by the negative binomial ( nbd ) or the log - normal ( lnd ) distributions  @xcite .",
    "even they however fail to reproduce all the details observed in the data .",
    "in particular , experimental data show two interesting features  @xcite : + 1 ) a pronounced shoulder in md in the range of intermediate multiplicities and + 2 ) a quasi - oscillatory behavior of the ratio @xmath43 as a function of rank @xmath41 .",
    "in the paper  @xcite presented to this conference , authors attempted to find a common origin of both aforementioned effects .",
    "they have shown ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : md1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : md2 ] ) that good quantitative description of the data can be obtained by a superposition of two nbd s with the relative proportion given by the ratio of 2-jet to multi - jet events as defined in the same experiments .",
    "it was also demonstrated that the truncation effect ( @xmath44 ) in experimentally measured md can not be neglected .",
    "( 78,101)(1,0 )    ( 78,90)(1,1 )    thus , the shape of md in   can be understood in terms of the multi - jet event topology , predicted by pqcd .",
    "let us now turn to the `` dirty''world of @xmath36-collisions . here",
    "the bulk of the cross section is due to soft , low @xmath45 processes , and hence pqcd approach is not fully justified .",
    "surprisingly , we find nevertheless , that both discussed features of md are well familiar in @xmath36 experiments as well  @xcite .    as we have seen , an essential ingredient for a successful description of the data is a _ two - component _ structure of md . in hard collisions ( )",
    "it could be identified with two- and multi - jet events . what is the origin of these components in predominantly soft @xmath36 processes ?",
    "looking further back in history , we do find a good candidate .",
    "it was shown that the dual parton model ( dpm )  @xcite , based on reggeon field theory  @xcite , is able to reproduce the shape of kno - distributions and to describe two - particle correlations in high energy @xmath46- and -collisions . in the framwork of dpm , multi - pomeron exchanges , which are necessary to unitarize the hadron - hadron scattering amplitude , naturally lead to the different event topologies , consisting of 1- , 2- , ... pomeron strings .",
    "it would be very interesting to see whether the oscillations of @xmath43 are also reproduced by dpm .",
    "another large area where soft physics plays the dominant rle is diffraction .",
    "the basic properties of diffractive processes ",
    "cross sections exponentially falling with four momentum transfer squared , @xmath47 , predominantly low mass final states , @xmath48 , large rapidity intervals between the diffractively produced hadronic systems , etc .",
    " have been established already in the 60 s and 70 s in hadron - hadron scattering experiments .",
    "these properties are typical for soft , peripheral interactions , and they found a best and most natural explanation in a framework of regge approach  @xcite .",
    "a number of comprehensive review articles  @xcite@xmath49@xcite nicely summarise the experimental status in this field and the interpretation of the data in terms of regge theory .    since the advent of the parton model and",
    "then qcd a main emphasis was shifted to _",
    "hard processes _ , leaving for diffraction only a little attention .",
    "a spike of interest was caused by the observation of jets in diffractive final states  @xcite , following the pioneering proposal by ingelman and schlein  @xcite , who invented a concept of the pomeron structure function .",
    "a real `` renaissance '' however was triggered by early hera data  @xcite on the proton structure function , @xmath50 at low @xmath51 , and the observation of large rapidity gap events in deep inelastic @xmath1 scattering  @xcite . only then it was clearly realized , that diffraction and low @xmath51 physics at hera are closely related subjects with high potential to provide a completely new insight into non - perturbative qcd effects , as well as to bridge the soft ( regge ) and hard ( pqcd ) domains .",
    "in regge theory the asymptotic behavior of the energy dependences of total , elastic and diffractive dissociation cross sections is defined by the properties of the leading vacuum ( pomeranchuk ) trajectory : ( t ) = 1 + + t [ eq : sp ] with the intercept @xmath52 .",
    "as has been demonstrated by donnachie and landshoff  @xcite , the energy dependence of _ any _ total hadronic cross section @xmath53 can be described in a very economical form _",

    "new data have been presented by the l3 collaboration @xcite on total gamma - gamma cross sections at small virtualities @xmath63 gev@xmath61 .",
    "the data have been extracted from collisions at @xmath64 and 140 gev , recently collected at lep on its way to lep-200 .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : stot ] these data are also consistent with the parametrization  ( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "the dashed and the dotted curves on fig .",
    "[ fig : stot ] demonstrate the energy dependence  ( [ eq : sigma ] ) with @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively , obtained separately from the best description of the tevatron data  @xcite and of photoproduction data including hera measurements  @xcite into the fit .",
    "it should be stressed however , that the original result  ( [ dlfit ] ) remains a good _ global _ fit of all total hadronic cross sections , leading to a very attractive concept of a _",
    "universal pomeron_.    in all so far discussed reactions soft , long distance physics represents the dominant contribution .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath67 is often referred to as the intercept of the ` soft ' pomeron . in case of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) where it is natural to expect hard processes to dominate , a much steeper rise was observed of @xmath68 with energy @xmath69 , ( or , equivalently , a rise of @xmath50 with decreasing bjorken @xmath51 ) which can be approximated by a power low @xmath70 with @xmath71 depending on the virtuality @xmath72 of the photon  @xcite . at the beginning it was tempting to explain this fast rise as a manifestation of perturbative bfkl pomeron  @xcite , which in leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) corresponds to _ _ bfkl = _ s 0.4 0.5 [ eq : bfkl ] this value of @xmath73 , as was pointed out by the authors themselves  @xcite , should not be seen uncritically , since next - to - leading order corrections may significantly change the result of lla calculation .",
    "therefore , more realistic and cautious expectation for the intercept of the ` hard ' pomeron ( sometimes also referred to as the _ qcd pomeron _ ) is @xmath74 .    reaching this stage",
    ", an innocent reader may immediately conclude : @xmath75 and wonder , how many pomerons are there after all ? moreover , whatever the exact value of @xmath76 is , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) will sooner or later violate the froissart bound .",
    "the variety of the opinions can be summarized in the following way .",
    "first of all , everybody agrees , that unitarity corrections to one - pomeron exchange are necessary , although different technical schemes were proposed for the unitarization procedure : multi - pomeron exchanges  @xcite , eikonalization of the scattering amplitude  @xcite , or the combination of both  @xcite .",
    "thus , the intercept of the ` bare ' pomeron may be significantly different from the ` effective ' intercept measured in the experiments , depending on how large unitarity corrections to a single - pomeron exchange amplitude are . at this point",
    "the opinions ( models ) start to diverge : + 1 ) at presently available energies unitarity corrections are negligible , and the universal ` bare ' pomeron has an intercept of @xmath67 .",
    "these models are in fact ruled out by @xmath50 measurements at hera .",
    "+ 2 ) the universal ( i.e. the same in hadron - hadron and in dis reactions ) ` bare ' pomeron has an intercept of @xmath77 .",
    "the effect of screening ( unitarity ) corrections depends on both the energy and a typical hard scale involved .",
    "the value of @xmath78 observed in hadronic reactions is thus a result of large corrections , whereas in dis the corrections become small with increasing @xmath72 , and hence the ` bare ' pomeron is seen .",
    "+ 3 ) ` bare ' pomeron @xmath79 bfkl pomeron , but screening corrections are so large that the effective power @xmath76 becomes smaller even in the dis case .",
    "+ 4 ) there is no pomeron whatsoever in dis .",
    "the rise of @xmath50 at small @xmath51 can be equivalently well described by the conventional dglap  @xcite evolution equations , while the rapidity gap events in dis may be due to various mechanisms  @xcite , which do not need the concept of pomeron .",
    "further , more illuminating discussion about the ` soft ' and ` hard ' pomeron can be found elsewhere  @xcite . from our point of view",
    ", there is only one pomeron ( and in that sense it is universal ) , which however receives contributions from both non - perturbative and perturbative exchanges .",
    "depending on the experimental conditions , either soft , or hard component will dominate , thus leading to the different values of @xmath76 observed .",
    "screening corrections may additionally reduce the value of the ` effective ' intercept .",
    "as already was mentioned ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath50 measurement alone is too inclusive to conclude unambiguousely on bfkl dynamics",
    ". therefore , dedicated measurements of diffractive processes are necessary to decide whether or not ` hard ' pomeron is seen at hera .",
    "we now turn directly to this topic .",
    "experimentally , diffractive processes at hera are studied by looking for so called _ large rapidity gap _ events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rg ] ) , which are naturally expected , and are not exponentially suppressed , in the case of colourless exchange between the proton and the virtual photon .",
    "defining as usual @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath41 and @xmath82 denote the 4-vectors of the virtual photon and the proton respectively , further relevant kinematic variables can be introduced : @xmath83    ( 80,46)(-5,0 )    note , that despite the suggestive names ( e.g. @xmath84 ) the described experimental definition is completely general .",
    "a cross section measured at different values of the aforementioned kinematical variables is free of any assumptions on the nature of contributing processes .",
    "it is only when interpreting the results in terms of diffractive dissociation that one has to select a kinematical range where the pomeron exchange dominates ( small @xmath85 ) and to take into account possible remaining non - diffractive contributions .",
    "the h1 and zeus experiments use the capabilities of their forward detectors to either identify the leading baryonic system @xmath86 as a proton or a neutron , or to restrict its mass , @xmath87 gev , if the system @xmath86 is not directly observed .",
    "this guarantees the gap between the hadronic systems @xmath88 and @xmath86 to be larger than 3 to 4 units in rapidity .",
    "furthermore , the specifically asymmetric kinematics of hera , due to very different proton and lepton beam energies , ensures a uniquely high detector acceptance for the diffractively produced hadronic system @xmath88 .",
    "this enables precision measurements of the diffractive dissociation of virtual photon at hera .",
    "finally , high resolving power ( @xmath72 ) of the virtual photon allows for the first time in high energy physics the partonic sub - structure of the exchanged object in diffraction to be probed .",
    "a special interest to soft diffractive processes is related to the expectation to see an effect of unitarity corrections to the diffractive cross sections at presently available energies .",
    "indeed , since a pumplin limit  @xcite , @xmath89 , is violated significantly earlier than the froissart bound  @xcite , @xmath90 , one expects unitarity corrections to a single pomeron exchange to become more important in diffractive processes compared to the total cross section .",
    "first experimental evidence of this has been reported for collisions at the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "it is well known in regge phenomenology that the information about the pomeron intercept can be extracted not only from the energy dependences of the total and diffractive cross sections , but also from the diffractive mass distributions . moreover , in the context of eikonal models  @xcite the differential cross section @xmath91 is not affected by screening corrections .",
    "hence a bare pomeron intercept is expected to be seen .",
    "thus comparing the values of @xmath92 extracted from the diffractive mass distributions with those obtained from the energy dependence of the cross sections may provide important information about screening corrections in soft diffractive processes .    at this conference",
    "two hera experiments have presented first preliminary data on inclusive diffractive photoproduction at comparable energies of @xmath93 gev ( h1  @xcite ) and @xmath94 gev ( zeus  @xcite ) .",
    "( 80,78)(0,1 )    triple regge analyses of the diffractive mass spectra in the reaction @xmath95 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gpmx ] ) , after correcting for the unmeasured @xmath47-dependences , yield the intercept values , entirely consistent with the ` soft ' pomeron : @xmath96    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     @xmath96 yet the data and their precision are insufficient for any firm conclusion about the importance of screening corrections at hera energies .",
    "first direct information about the partonic structure of the pomeron can be extracted from the inclusive measurements in diffractive dis : = ( 1-y+ ) 2d(,q^2 , ) , [ eq : f2d3 ] where @xmath97 is the inelasticity parameter .",
    "new data on the differential cross section  ( [ eq : f2d3 ] ) have been presented by zeus  @xcite and h1  @xcite .",
    "high statistics , based on 2 pb@xmath98 of 1994 data , enables h1 to perform qcd analysis of the diffractive structure function @xmath99 which resulted in the parton distributions , shown in fig .",

    "@xcite .",
    "such a ` gluon dominated pomeron ' leads to definite predictions about the properties of the hadronic final states in dis diffraction , which can be confronted with experimental data .",
    "for example , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] , more energy flow , bigger @xmath101 and lower thrust values in the @xmath102 centre of mass system are expected in case of a gluon dominated exchanged object , as compared to a quark dominated one .",
    "a significant difference is also expected in the production rates of charm and of high @xmath103 jets .",

    "[ fig : gp_jets]c , is that a sizable proportion of diffractive hard photoproduction is produced via the so called _ resolved _ photon contribution , in which only a fraction of the photon momentum , @xmath104 participates in the hard subprocess .",
