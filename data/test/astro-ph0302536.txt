    "the primordial cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) was generated when photons first decoupled from the baryonic fluid when the universe was only 400,000 years old .",
    "the vast majority of these photons travel unperturbed to the present day , and features of their angular power spectrum such as acoustic peaks and the damping tail @xcite record valuable information about cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "baryons and dark matter evolve from small inhomogeneities at decoupling into increasingly complicated large - scale structure which can subtly perturb the observed pattern of cmb anisotropies . assuming that the primordial cmb is gaussian , non - gaussian correlations in the observed map can be used to reconstruct the intervening large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "in addition to the importance of learning about the large - scale structure itself , reconstruction of the weak - lensing potential generated by structure is essential to constraining tensor perturbations .",
    "weak lensing converts a fraction of the e - mode polarization generated by scalar perturbations at the last - scattering surface into b - mode polarization in the observed map . only by subtracting this b - mode polarization",
    "can one conclusively detect the primordial b - modes which serve as a model - independent signal of tensor perturbations @xcite .",
    "understanding lensing reconstruction requires a more detailed discussion of how weak lensing affects the cmb .",
    "weak gravitational lensing deflects the paths of cmb photons as they travel from the last - scattering surface to the observer .",
    "this deflection is accomplished by a projected lensing potential which is a weighted line - of - sight integral of the gravitational potential between the observer and the surface of last - scattering . at each point on the sky , lensing remaps the temperature and polarization to that of a nearby point at the last - scattering surface , the deflection angle being the gradient of the aforementioned projected lensing potential . assuming that this deflection angle is small",
    ", the temperature at any point can be expanded in a taylor series in the gradient of the lensing potential . in fourier space",
    ", this expansion appears as a series of convolutions of individual temperature and projected potential modes .",
    "the observed temperature - squared map in fourier space also appears as a convolution of individual fourier modes .",
    "subject to an overall normalization dependent on the scale of the fourier mode , these convolutions cancel in such a manner that each fourier mode of the temperature - squared map acts as an estimator for the _ same _ fourier mode of the projected lensing potential .",
    "lensing reconstruction as outlined above has been considered previously @xcite . in these works ,",
    "two sources of noise were identified , and a filter of the temperature - squared map in fourier space was chosen to minimize the variance associated with lensing reconstruction subject to these noise sources .",
    "the first source is intrinsic signal variance ; the observed large - scale structure is one arbitrary member of an ensemble of realizations allowed by theory .",
    "the second source of noise , endemic to this method of lensing reconstruction , is a consequence of the nature of the primordial cmb . like the large - scale structure itself ,",
    "the pattern of cmb anisotropies at the last - scattering surface is only one of many possible realizations allowed by theory .",
    "we do not know _ a priori _ which of these realizations nature has provided us , and this uncertainty hinders our ability to deconvolve the effects of lensing from true anisotropies at the last - scattering surface .",
    "even if the true pattern of anisotropies at the last - scattering surface was known , the finite amount of power in the cmb at small scales would still constrain lensing reconstruction .",
    "silk damping at the last - scattering surface suppresses cmb power at small scales , while the finite resolution of any real experiment would limit the detection of any signal that is present at small scales .",
    "lensing reconstruction fails below scales at which there is sufficient power , for the same reason that any remapping is indistinguishable given a uniform background .    here",
    ", we consider a third source of noise neglected in previous studies .",
    "the filtered temperature - squared map is an unbiased estimator for the lensing potential in the approximation that a correlation between two given temperature modes is induced only by the single lensing mode whose wavevector is the sum of that of the two temperature modes .",
    "in actuality , any combination of two or more lensing modes whose wavevectors sum to this total induce correlations between the two temperature modes .",
    "there are many such combinations , but since these correlations add incoherently we do not expect a systematic bias . nonetheless , for estimators of each individual lensing mode we must use our knowledge of other lensing modes to subtract off this unwanted bias .",
    "this is an iterative process , and since our knowledge of the lensing map is imperfect it induces noise in lensing reconstruction .",
    "we calculate this additional variance for various estimators constructed from cmb temperature and polarization maps , and show how it compares to the dominant noise sources for an all - sky cmb experiment with a noise - equivalent temperature of 1 @xmath1k @xmath2 . since the lensing - potential power spectrum is a measure of the theoretical uncertainty with which we can predict the value of a given lensing mode , this noise associated with lensing reconstruction causes a systematic overestimation of the lensing - potential power spectrum .",
    "this systematic bias must be accounted for in order to compare observations with theoretical predictions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ s : lensing ] , we define the formalism we will use to explore the effects of weak lensing on the cmb .",
    "the taylor expansion of the lensed cmb map in gradients of the lensing potential is given in both real and fourier space , and the power spectra and trispectra of various components of the cmb temperature map are listed for later use . in ",
    "[ s : estimators ] , we show that the fourier modes of the temperature - squared map when properly filtered can serve as estimators for the fourier modes of the displacement map with the same wave vector . using the power spectrum and trispectrum given in the preceding section , we calculate the variance associated with this estimator including a new component neglected in previous studies .",

    "we then use the displacement estimator for individual fourier modes to construct an unbiased estimator for the lensing - potential power spectrum in   [ s : power ] , and calculate the variance and covariance associated with this estimator .",
