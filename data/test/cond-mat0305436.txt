    "random series representations are among the most general starting points for the derivation of finite approximations to the feynman - ka formula.@xcite the feynman - ka formula computes the density matrix of a quantum system as an infinite dimensional stochastic integral@xcite and constitutes the main ingredient for the computation of quantal thermodynamic properties by monte carlo path integral techniques.@xcite current research is focused on the development of rapidly convergent finite - dimensional approximations to the feynman - ka formula . in deciding upon the efficiency of a certain method , one has to take into account both the number of path variables required and the computational time necessary to evaluate the various quantities involved .    one special group of path integral methods , which we shall refer to as direct methods , have the property that they require knowledge of the intermolecular potential only for the computation of the density matrix or the partition function of a physical system .",
    "numerical algorithms based upon such methods have the advantage that they can be used as `` black boxes . ''",
    "many times , the potential energy surface of a system is a rather complicated function of the physical coordinates and there are no computational alternatives to such direct methods .",
    "it is therefore important to look for those direct methods that have the fastest asymptotic convergence and which minimize the number of calls to the potential .",
    "the most widely used direct method is the trapezoidal trotter discrete path integral ( dpi ) method.@xcite it is usually derived by means of the trotter product rule and an appropriate short - time high - temperature approximation .",
    "the formal asymptotic convergence of the trapezoidal trotter dpi method and of related dpi techniques was extensively studied by suzuki@xcite and was found to be @xmath0.@xcite as shown in ref .",

    "the dimensionality of the integral approximations for the density matrix is equal to the number of quadrature points .",
    "a second approach to constructing finite - dimensional approximations for density matrices is based on the random series representations of the feynman - ka formula .",
    "special modifications of these random series by means of the so - called reweighted techniques have been initially considered on an intuitive basis in refs .",
    "( ) and ( ) . depending upon the specific series , these modifications have been shown numerically to have asymptotic convergence equal to or faster than that of the trapezoidal trotter dpi method .",
    "more recently , the correct definition and the convergence properties of the reweighted techniques have been shown to depend upon the asymptotic convergence of the partial averaging method.@xcite in fact , once the convergence of the partial averaging method has been fully understood,@xcite it became possible to develop reweighted techniques that have optimal asymptotic convergence.@xcite the numerical implementation of two optimal reweighed methods that are based upon the lvy - ciesielski and the wiener - fourier series , respectively will be thoroughly analyzed in the present article .",
    "though their mathematical justification is rather involved , these two reweighted techniques have the advantages that they are direct methods and that they have cubic convergence for smooth enough potentials .",
    "however , as with the full feynman - ka formula , the path averages of the potential , which involve one - dimensional integrals on a compact interval , are assumed to be computed exactly . in practice ,",
    "one is forced to make recourse to a certain quadrature scheme .",
    "let us remember that for the trapezoidal trotter dpi method the number of quadrature points is equal to the number of path variables .",
    "it follows that in order to preserve the overall cubic convergence of the reweighted methods , one needs to utilize a quadrature technique which uses a number of quadrature points proportional to the number of path variables and which preserves the asymptotic convergence of the reweighted techniques .",
    "it is within the scope of the present article to show that such quadrature schemes exist and to construct minimalist examples for either of the two reweighted techniques presented .",
    "the main tasks of the present article are a ) to review in a transparent fashion the construction of the reweighted techniques , b ) to present numerical examples demonstrating the cubic convergence of the methods , and c ) to devise quadrature schemes that preserve the asymptotic convergence of the methods , while employing a number of quadrature points proportional to the number of path variables . based upon the numerical evidence presented as well as on the formal convergence properties of the methods ,",

    "in this section , we shall discuss the class of potentials that are bounded from below and have strong positive singularities at origin of the form @xmath165 with @xmath166 .",
    "this class of potentials contains the lennard - jones potential .",
    "we shall first discuss the case of three dimensional potentials and then go back to the one - dimensional lennard - jones potential discussed in section  v.b .",
    "we focus mainly on the three - dimensional examples because these are of practical importance . as such",
    ", we consider a particle of mass @xmath167 moving in a spherical potential of the form @xmath168 where @xmath169 is a bounded from below potential that behaves at origin as @xmath165 and is otherwise an infinitely differentiable function decaying to zero at infinity .",
    "the term @xmath170 is added to confine the system about the origin so that the resulting hamiltonian has discrete spectrum .",
    "the question we ask is about the decay of the density matrix at the singularity @xmath171 . for the sake of having an example , we set @xmath172 .",
    "clearly , the classical diagonal density matrix @xmath173 $ ] has an exponential decay to zero at the singularity any time @xmath166 .",
    "as the quantum diffusion takes place ( we interpret @xmath174 as a time parameter ) , the system starts to explore the singularities of the potential and the diagonal density matrix tends to spread out .",
    "the strong decay to zero of the classical density matrix near singularities is attenuated and , as we shall see , if the singularities are not very strong , the quantum density matrix may even fail to decay to zero . on physical grounds",
    ", we expect the effect to get stronger in the limit @xmath175 , when the system is also brought into its ground state eigenfunction .",
    "therefore , it is not farfetched to assume that the decay of the density matrix at the singularity is controlled by the decay of the ground state eigenfunction . for this reason",
    ", we shall focus our attention on the behavior of the ground state eigenfunction near singularities .",
    "we remind the reader that the ground state eigenfunction satisfies the schrdinger equation @xmath176 + v(r)\\psi(r)= e_0 \\psi(r)\\ ] ] and that it is the only positive eigenfunction ( one uses this property to easily check if an eigenfunction is the ground state eigenfunction ) .    it has been discussed in section  ii.b of ref .",
    "( ) that if @xmath177 , then the potential @xmath178 is a kato - class potential . in this case , it is known that the density matrix _ does not _ decay to zero at the singularity . a quick way to verify",
    "this is to notice that if @xmath177 , then the potential @xmath178 has finite gaussian transform .",
    "in this conditions , theorem  4 of ref .",

    "we notice that the rate of decay increases as @xmath185 becomes larger because the `` intensity '' of the positive singularity @xmath186 also increases .",
    "if @xmath187 , then the decay at the singularity is exponential .",
    "this is demonstrated by the decay at origin of the ground state eigenfunction @xmath188\\ ] ] of the potential @xmath189 where @xmath190 .",
    "the ground state eigenvalue for the given example is @xmath191",
    ".    as the last example shows , the density matrix for a lennard - jones potential , potential that has a positive singularity of the form @xmath192 at origin , is decaying exponentially fast at @xmath193 .",
    "because of this strong decay , the expectation values of the squares of the first and second derivatives of the potential against the diagonal density matrix are finite .",
    "as discussed in section  v.b , in these conditions we expect that the convergence rates of the reweighted techniques are cubic .",
    "a similar discussion holds for a one - dimensional system . for instance , the ground state eigenfunction of the potential @xmath194 is @xmath195 , & x > 0 , \\\\ 0 , & x \\leq 0\\end{array } \\right . .\\ ] ] again , @xmath196 has exponential decay at @xmath197 whenever @xmath198 .",
