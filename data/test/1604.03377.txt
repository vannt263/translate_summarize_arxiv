    "the idea of grand unification has been considered as one of the appealing ways to think about physics beyond the standard model . the simplest grand unified theory was proposed in 1974 by h.  georgi and s.  glashow  @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on the @xmath0 gauge symmetry and makes several striking predictions .",
    "it predicts a new phenomena in nature , the decay of the proton  @xcite . for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite . in this context",
    "the standard model interactions can be seen as different manifestations of the same fundamental interaction at the low scale .",
    "one can understand the electric charge quantization and predict the weinberg s angle .",
    "last , but not least , this theory predicts the existence of a great desert between the electroweak scale and unification scale where the @xmath0 symmetry could be realised .",
    "it is well - known that the georgi - glashow model  @xcite is ruled out by the experiments . in this context",
    "the standard model matter fields are unified in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 representations , while the minimal higgs sector is composed of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 higgses .",
    "this model is ruled out because one can not reproduce the experimental values of the gauge couplings measured at the low scale .    in this letter",
    "we discuss the different realistic scenarios for @xmath0 unification proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . after a detailed discussion we propose a new grand unified theory where the charged fermion masses are generated at the renormalizable level , while the neutrino masses are generated at the quantum level through the zee mechanism  @xcite . for the first time , in the context of a grand unified theory based on the @xmath0 symmetry , one can find a simple relation between charged fermion masses and neutrino masses .",
    "we investigate the unification of gauge interactions and show we can have consistent scenarios for unification when the colored octet present in the theory is not very heavy .",
    "therefore , this theory predicts the possibility to observe exotic signals at current and future colliders .",
    "the predictions for proton decay are shown in order to understand the testability of the theory at the super - kamiokande or hyper - kamiokande experiments . the model proposed in this letter",
    "can be considered as one of the simplest renormalizable @xmath0 models .",
    "it is possible to write down very simple realistic extensions of the georgi - glashow model .",
    "this issue has been investigated by many experts in the field . here",
    "we discuss the two simple models :    * type ii - su(5 ) : in this case one generates neutrino masses through the type ii  @xcite seesaw mechanism and making use of the higher - dimensional operators one can have a consistent relation between the masses for down quarks and charged leptons . in this model",
    "the unification constraints imply that the leptoquark with quantum numbers @xmath5 living in the @xmath6 must be light .",
    "this non - renormalizable model has been studied in detail in refs .",
    "type iii - su(5 ) : using a combination of the type i  @xcite and type iii  @xcite seesaw mechanisms adding the @xmath7 fermionic representation one can define a simple realistic model based on @xmath0 . see refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed study .",
    "this model is non - renormalizable since higher - dimensional operators are used to correct the mass relation between the down quarks and charged leptons , and to understand the splitting between the different fields in the @xmath7 representation .",
    "the unification constraints in this context tell us that the fermionic triplet needed for type iii seesaw must be light .",
    "the models discussed above are non - renormalizable .",
    "it is very well - known that in order to have a realistic relation between down quarks and charged leptons at the renormalizable level one must add the @xmath8 representation  @xcite .",
    "now , one could ask : _ what is the simplest realistic renormalizable model based on @xmath0 ? _ .    the scenarios discussed above can be used as a guide to define the simplest model . in the type ii - su(5 )",
    "case one has two extra higgses , @xmath9 and @xmath8  @xcite , or in the type iii - su(5 ) case one has @xmath8 and one extra fermionic @xmath7  @xcite representation .",
    "a different case could be considered where the neutrino masses are generated through type i seesaw and one has at least two extra singlets , right - handed neutrinos , and the extra higgs @xmath8 .",
    "this scenario can be realistic  @xcite but one expects naively that the fermionic singlets should get mass from above gut scale since their masses are not protected by the su(5 ) gauge symmetry .    in the next section",
    "we will show that a realistic renormalizable model can be defined with two extra higgses , @xmath10 and @xmath8 , where neutrino masses are generated through the zee mechanism . here",
    "the @xmath8 plays also a crucial role to generate neutrino masses .",
    "in the zee model  @xcite for neutrino masses two extra higgses are needed to generate neutrino masses at one - loop level .",
    "one has two higgs doublets including the sm higgs boson .",
    "in our notation we have @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the relevant interactions are given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , the matrix @xmath17 is antisymmetric in the flavor space , and @xmath18 are the yukawa matrices for the two higgses present in the theory . here the global @xmath19 symmetry is broken due to the simultaneous presence of the first yukawa interaction proportional to @xmath17 and the last term proportional to the @xmath20 parameter .",
    "computing the neutrino mass matrix in the broken phase one finds @xmath21    where the angle @xmath22 defines the relation between the charged higgses in the higgs doublets @xmath23 the mixing angle @xmath22 is defined by the diagonalization of the mass matrix for the @xmath24 higgses and one finds @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the vacuum expectation values of the neutral higgses satisfying the relation @xmath28 where @xmath29 gev . here",
    "@xmath30 are the goldstone bosons eaten up by the @xmath31 .",
    "the mixing @xmath32 defines the mixing between the @xmath33 and the singlet @xmath34 @xmath35 in the above equation @xmath32 is proportial to the @xmath20 parameter .",
    "therefore , the neutrino masses are also proportional to the @xmath20 parameter which breaks the global @xmath19",
    ". then , when @xmath20 is small one can naturally have small neutrino masses and this parameter is protected by the symmetry .",
    "notice that when we assume the zee - wolfenstein model  @xcite where only one higgs couples to leptons the resulting mass matrix has zero diagonal entries .",
    "this particular scenario is ruled out by the experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , in the general zee model for neutrino masses one has enough freedom to reproduce the values for neutrino mixings and masses . see for example  @xcite for a recent study of the zee model .",
    "now , the zee model can be realized in a grand unified theory based on @xmath0 adding the new higgs in the antisymmetric representation @xmath10 which contains the charged singlet @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "a second higgs doublet is needed as we discussed . however ,",
    "if we are in the minimal renormalizable @xmath0 there is no need to introduce a new higgs because the @xmath8 representation contains already a second higgs doublet .",
    "this is a crucial observation which allow us to define a simple model where the neutrino masses are related to the charged fermion masses . as we know , the @xmath8 representation has to be in the renormalizable theory in order to correct the mass relation between the charged leptons and down quarks . in the @xmath0 language",
    "the needed interactions for the zee model read as @xmath36 in this way we can see that the minimal renormalizable @xmath0 without extra singlets is defined by the zee mechanism for neutrino masses .",
    "clearly , one can see that since @xmath37 and @xmath38 can not be diagonalized simultaneously , the diagonal elements of the neutrino mass matrix are not zero even if @xmath17 is antisymmetric .",
    "therefore , the model has enough freedom to be consistent with the experimental values for neutrino masses and mixings . using the relation between the charged fermion masses and the yukawa couplings in the renormalizable theory @xmath39",
    "the neutrino mass matrix can be written as @xmath40 where the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 encode the information of the 1-loop radiative correction to the neutrino masses and are given in the appendix .",
    "this relation is quite interesting because in @xmath0 a relation between the neutrino masses and the charged fermion masses is not expected .",
    "notice that the anti - symmetric matrix @xmath17 defines this relation and it has only three free parameters .",
    "this is one of our main results .",
    "working in the basis where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are diagonal , using @xmath45 , and neglecting all phases for simplicity one finds @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the matrix which rotates the @xmath48 quarks , which has only three parameters in the real case , and the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 are given in the appendix . as one",
    "can see the above matrix has enough parameters to reproduce the values for the mixing angles and masses .",
    "notice that in this model the ratio between the fermion masses can not be predicted but one can have a simple relation between them which can be constrained using the experimental values for fermion masses and mixings . in a future publication",
    "we will investigate the constrains on the free parameters including the running of the fermion masses and possible predictions for lepton flavor violating processes .      in this section",
    "we show the simplest scenarios where one can have unification of the gauge interactions in agreement with the experiments .",
    "the renormalization group equations for the gauge couplings can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the mass of the particle living in the great desert .",
    "the equations for the running of the gauge couplings can be rewritten in a more suitable form in terms of the differences in the coefficients @xmath52 and low energy observables  @xcite at the electroweak scale .",
    "these equations read as @xmath53 + adopting the experimental values , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56  @xcite one finds @xmath57 therefore , these values must be reached in order to achieve unification of the couplings .",
    ".@xmath58 coefficients . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ b_coef_su5 ]    in table i we show the contributions of the physical fields in @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath10 and @xmath8 to the running of the gauge couplings .",
    "the triplet @xmath61 in @xmath59 has to be heavy , @xmath62 gev , in order to satisfy the proton decay bounds .",
    "the only field in @xmath60 which can help for the unification is @xmath63 . even if @xmath64 and @xmath65 are at the electroweak scale the constraints in eqs .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16 ) can not be satisfied because @xmath66 . since only the fields with negative contribution to @xmath67 and positive contribution to @xmath68 can help to achieve unification in agreement with the experiment , only the fields @xmath69 and @xmath70 in @xmath8 can help .",
    "the field @xmath71 also can help to increase the gut scale and suppress proton decay .    in the @xmath10",
    "only the field @xmath72 could help to achieve consistent unification but one should notice that it mediates proton decay .",
    "the @xmath72 couples to fermions through the term @xmath73 in the folowing way @xmath74 , where @xmath75 in the @xmath76 space . hence , @xmath72 alone can not mediate proton decay .",
    "however , the term @xmath77 in the scalar potential together with the above interaction give us a contribution to proton decay as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "violating proton decay contribution . ]    a qualitative study on the bounds of the delta mass scale can be made by considering the effective coupling of the process shown in fig .  1 , which is given by @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the coupling in the @xmath80 interaction .",
    "in order to satisfy the bounds on proton decay , @xmath81 as in the usual higgs mediated @xmath82 proton decay contribution .",
    "notice that , due to the presence of the triplet mass squared in the denominator , the mass of @xmath72 is not necessarily required to be heavy ( the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath20 are constrained to be small since they appear in the neutrino mass matrix ) . in this way",
    "one understands the @xmath19 violating contribution to proton decay mediated by @xmath72 .",
    "the dashed green line shows the naive lhc bound on the colored octet mass , @xmath83 tev  @xcite .",
    "the red dashed line shows the limit on the gut scale from the current experimental value on proton decay lifetime , @xmath84 years  @xcite .",
    "the orange dashed line shows the projected limit on the proton decay lifetime from the hyper - kamiokande collaboration , @xmath85 years  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the @xmath69 is in the range @xmath86 gev from left to right . ]    in this model one has the usual doublet - triplet splitting problem since we need to split the @xmath59 representation and assume that the @xmath61 field is very heavy .",
    "now , in the @xmath8 one has the same fine - tuning problem because the second higgs @xmath70 must be light in order to have a large vacuum expectation value needed to correct the fermion masses .",
    "the simplest way to show that unification can be achieved in a consistent way is to assume only the splitting of the @xmath8 representation .",
    "we will assume that there is no mass splitting in @xmath10 or in @xmath60 , and show the unification constraints in the scenarios where less fine - tuning is needed .    in fig .  2 , assuming unification of the gauge couplings at one - loop level , we show the allowed values for the masses of the @xmath87 and the unification scale .",
    "the solutions in agreement with the experiments are shown by the blue line . in this case",
    "we assume that @xmath88 tev and the mass of @xmath89 changes from @xmath90 and @xmath91 gev .",
    "the couplings of the @xmath69 to matter are not constrained by the fermion masses so that they can be small to suppress proton decay .",

    "we also show in fig .  2 the limit projected ( orange line ) by the hyper - kamiokande collaboration , @xmath85 years  @xcite .",
    "as one can appreciate , the main prediction from the unification of the gauge interactions is that the field @xmath71 has to be light and the model could be tested in the near future in proton decay experiments .    in the case",
    "when the mass of @xmath71 is close to the tev scale one could hope to produce it at the lhc .",
    "the yukawa interactions for the field @xmath71 are given by @xmath93 notice that one can produce @xmath71 with large cross sections through qcd interactions .",
    "the second term in the above equation comes from the interaction @xmath94 .",
    "notice that since the second coupling above is anti - symmetric the decays into two top - quarks would not be observed .",
    "therefore , one can have exotic signatures such as signals with one top quark and three light jets .",

    "we have investigated the unification constraints and we have shown that the only extra light higgses are @xmath70 and @xmath71 which do not mediate proton decay . therefore , the main contribution to proton decay are the gauge contributions .",
