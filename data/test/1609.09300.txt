    "@xmath1  eridani ( hd 29248 , @xmath2 , b2 iii , henceforth @xmath1  eri ) is arguably the asteroseismically best studied @xmath0  cephei star ( for more information on this group of massive pulsating variable stars see stankov & handler 2005 ) .",
    "after an immense ground - based observational effort involving both multisite photometry and high - resolution spectroscopy ( handler et al .",
    "2004 , aerts et al .",
    "2004 , de ridder et al .",
    "2004 , jerzykiewicz et al .",
    "2005 , hereinafter jhs ) , tight constraints on the overall chemical composition and convective core overshooting of this star were obtained , in combination with a detection of differential internal rotation ( pamyatnykh , handler & dziembowski 2004 ) .",
    "the latter study as well as alternative models to explain the star s pulsation spectrum ( ausseloos et al . 2004 ) additionally pointed towards a necessity for an increase of the iron - peak element opacities .",
    "this success was possible because the star s pulsation spectrum happened to be very suitable for asteroseismic studies .",
    "the pulsations contain a dominant radial mode that immediately constrains the stellar mean density .",
    "furthermore , a triplet of dipole modes was identified observationally , two more @xmath3 multiplets were found , and a single quadrupole mode was detected . fitting this observed pulsation spectrum with theoretical models ( pamyatnykh et al .",
    "2004 , ausseloos et al . 2004 ) revealed that the two lowest - frequency @xmath3 multiplets correspond to mixed modes , with different contributions from the gravity and pressure mode cavities , which makes the seismic information from them largely independent and complementary .",
    "in addition , low - frequency oscillations likely due to stellar gravity modes were detected ( handler et al . 2004 , aerts et al . 2004 , jhs ) .",
    "however , finding excitation of the latter in corresponding stellar models proved to be impossible and would require additional modification to the opacities used for the stellar models ( dziembowski & pamyatnykh 2008 ) .",
    "finally , daszyska - daszkiewicz & walczak ( 2010 ) applied their method of complex asteroseismology to @xmath1 eri and showed that neither with opal nor with op opacities alone the observed complex amplitude of the bolometric flux variation can be reproduced for both its p and g modes at the same time .",
    "after these studies , the asteroseismic information on the star appeared to be made full use of , at least as far as studies hinged on ground - based data are concerned : the above - mentioned campaigns yielded some 1130 h of time - resolved photometry and 430  h of time - series spectroscopy .",
    "therefore , a return to @xmath1  eri only appeared sensible once new data sets , extensive enough to resolve the pulsation spectrum , and of a quality allowing to decrease the noise level significantly would become accessible .",
    "such data sets are available nowadays .",
    "brite - constellation ( weiss et al . 2014 ) is a set of five nearly identical nanosatellites with high - quality pointing stability , each hosting a telescope with 30  mm aperture and an uncooled 11 megapixel ccd , which allows one to acquire time - series photometry of @xmath4 targets in a 24 degree field of view .",
    "two broadband filters are available , a blue filter with a central wavelength of about 420 nm and a red filter centred at 620 nm .",
    "although these filters do not have the standard johnson - cousins bandpasses , their effective wavelengths are similar to those of johnson @xmath5 and cousins @xmath6 , and we therefore name them simply @xmath5 and @xmath7 in the remainder of this work .",
    "the satellites are in low - earth orbits , meaning that they can observe the target fields for up to six months a year and for about 20 minutes per 101-minute orbit , depending on their position with respect to the sun and the earth .",
    "@xmath1  eri was observed during the second brite - constellation campaign directed towards the field of orion . in anticipation of these measurements ,",
    "ground - based photometric observations were organized to coincide temporally . in the following ,",
    "we report the results of both ground and space - based monitoring .",
    "photoelectric time - series measurements in support of brite were organized for two reasons . first , their analysis can be directly compared with that of jhs , and second , near - ultraviolet photometry that brite can not provide , is invaluable for the identification of the pulsation modes of @xmath0  cep stars .",
    "our ground - based data were obtained at two observatories . the bulk of the measurements originated from the 0.75-m automatic photoelectric telescope ( apt ) t6 at fairborn observatory in arizona .",
    "in addition , the 0.5-m telescope at the south african astronomical observatory was employed ( observer ez ) .",
    "differential time - series photoelectric data were collected through the strmgren @xmath8 filters , and the `` classical '' comparison stars @xmath9  eri ( hd 30211 , b5iv , @xmath10 ) and @xmath11  eri ( hd 27861 , a2v , @xmath12 ) were used .",
    "table  [ tab : glog ] gives a summary of those observations ; the time base is 135  d.    .log of the ground - based photometry of @xmath1  eri .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     [ tab : frevar ]    turning to the independent low frequencies ( @xmath1  eri is a hybrid p and g - mode pulsator ) , considerable changes have occurred since the work of jhs . a previously unknown signal @xmath13 now dominates the low - frequency domain . on the other hand ,",
    "the low - frequency signal @xmath14 by jhs is no longer detectable at all , and the amplitude of signal @xmath15 has dropped to about 2/3 of its previous value .",
    "the frequency of this signal has also considerably shifted . the biggest change compared to the results of jhs , however ,",
    "is the detection of a total of six new low - frequency independent modes ( @xmath16 ) . had these signals been present with similar amplitudes in the old data , most of them would have been detected , as a re - examination of this data set shows .",
    "one may suspect that the appearance of these g modes may be related to the decrease in amplitude of several of the p modes , in the sense that the pulsational energy lost by the p modes became available to raise the amplitudes of these g modes .",
    "the newly detected g modes make it tempting to look for equal frequency splittings indicative of the rotation rate in the stellar interior , particular when recalling the result by pamyatnykh et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that @xmath1  eri rotates some four times more rapidly near the core than on its surface . however , the theoretically predicted g - mode frequency spectrum ( e.g. , see fig",
    ". 6 of daszyska - daszkiewicz & walczak 2010 ) of @xmath1 eri is very dense . even in the small frequency region between 0.26  0.43 in which we detected six g modes , models predict 13 radial overtones of @xmath3 g modes .",
    "any claim of rotational splitting in the g - mode domain must therefore remain in the realm of speculation . on the other hand , it can at the same time also be speculated that the apparent change in frequency of mode @xmath15 may actually be a manifestation of a different mode present in the current data set .    moving on to the combination frequencies ,",
    "our results are mostly consistent with those by jhs ( apart from some amplitude variations ) as far as the first - order combinations are concerned , apart from us not detecting @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , but @xmath20 instead .",
    "we detect all the higher - order combination frequencies as did jhs , and add five more due to our lower detection limit .",
    "two @xmath21 scuti - type oscillation frequencies ( 10.874 and 17.252 ) originating from the comparison star @xmath11  eri were reported by jhs ; the lower - frequency of them was preliminarily mentioned by handler et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . the latter signal can be discerned in our present ground - based photometry using the same comparison star , but does not occur at a significant level .",
    "we were unable to find the higher - frequency variation reported by jhs .",
    "we caution that our new ground - based data are considerably fewer than those reported by jhs , which may explain these differences .",
    "we reported that the theoretically predicted pulsation amplitude - wavelength relation in the visual range is steeper than that observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mid ] ) .",
    "this raises the suspicion that the filter bandpasses we used for the calculations may be inaccurate . that the effect is systematic over the visual wavelength range covered by our measurements ( 4100 @xmath22 6200 ) ,",
    "i.e. not only one or two filters in the optical are affected , argues against such an interpretation , however .",
    "the same argument refutes that the problem stems from imperfections in the data reduction procedure ; furthermore the ground - based and space photometry were reduced independently .",
    "figure  [ fig:2cmid ] shows the discrepancy more drastically .",
    "the comparison of the theoretical loci of low-@xmath23 pulsation modes and the observed ones using combinations of two optical filters only and the observed positions of the well - identified modes @xmath24 shows some large discrepancies as far as the amplitude ratios are concerned .",
    "using these diagrams , the radial mode @xmath25 would rather be identified as a dipole , whereas the @xmath3 modes @xmath26 are located where @xmath27 modes would be expected . since this problem",
    "does arguably not originate from poorly known filter bandpasses , another explanation in physical terms needs to be sought .",
    "for instance , rapid stellar rotation would change the temperature and mode amplitude distribution on the stellar surface .",
    "hence amplitude ratios between different filters would become dependent on the inclination of the rotation axis to the line of sight , the rotation rate , and the azimuthal order of the modes and can deviate considerably from the non - rotating case ( e.g. , reese et al . 2013 ) .",
    "however , @xmath1  eri is an intrinsically slow rotator ( pamyatnykh et al .",
    "2004 ) with a surface rotation period of about two months , and such a possibility can hence be ruled out .",
    "the pulsation amplitudes of @xmath1  eri are relatively high and therefore harmonic and combination frequencies are observed .",
    "one may therefore surmise that nonlinear effects could modify the amplitudes , which would be unaccounted for by the models used to compute the theoretical amplitude ratios .",
    "indeed , the dominant modes of another @xmath0  cep star with prominent harmonics and combination frequencies , 12  lac ( handler et al . 2006 ) also have smaller amplitude ratios in the optical than theoretically predicted . on the other hand , stars with weak or no harmonics and combination frequencies with well - identified oscillations ( e.g , il vel and kz mus , handler et al .",
    "2003 . , v2052 oph , handler et al .",
    "2012 ) do not seem to show this effect , whereas it may be suspected in others ( v836 cen , dupret et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "another possibility is that there is a problem with the theoretical predictions of the pulsation amplitude vs. wavelength relation .",
    "we may for instance just have used non - optimal stellar input parameters . however , in such a situation it would be hard to understand why the amplitude ratios with respect to the strmgren @xmath28 filter were quite well reproduced .",
    "for instance , an incorrectly adopted effective temperature would cause a systematic change of the predicted amplitude ratios within all passbands as they are all located in the rayleigh - jeans tail of the stellar spectral energy distribution .",
    "we recall that the effective temperature adopted for our calculations is in perfect agreement with recent and modern spectral analyses ( nieva & przybilla 2012 ) .",
    "one more possible culprit would be a poor choice of the complex @xmath29 parameter that is a vital ingredient for the computation of theoretical pulsation amplitude ratios . as pointed out by , e.g. , daszyska - daszkiewicz & walczak ( 2010 ) , this parameter is very sensitive to the metal content and opacities in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "we have therefore made some experiments with modifying the @xmath29 parameter , e.g. by adopting empirically determined values ( daszyska - daszkiewicz & walczak 2010 ) instead of the ones predicted by stellar models .",
    "our experiments did not bear fruit , but more trials in this direction are advised . in any case , any seismic model that contains or proposes modifications to the @xmath29 parameter should also reproduce the observed amplitude ratios .    to conclude",
    ", we can not offer a good explanation for the discrepancy between the observed and theoretical pulsational amplitude ratios for the dominant modes of @xmath1 eri in the optical at this point .",
    "however , we do want to stress that identifying pulsational modes of @xmath0 cep stars from optical amplitude ratios ( and phase shifts ) alone may be misleading , at least until this problem has been resolved .",
    "we have reported the first combined analysis of simultaneous brite - constellation and ground - based photometry .",
    "the measurements were acquired for the well - studied @xmath0  cep star @xmath1  eri , with a combined duration of 173.5  d. this exemplary data set was used to show the power of joining these two types of observations , because they complement each other well in terms of suppressing aliasing problems in the data ; aliasing is practically non - existent if the data can be carefully analysed together .",
    "performing such a frequency analysis , we detected 40 signals in the light curves . among these",
    "are six newly discovered gravity - mode frequencies .",
    "their detection is a consequence of the combination of , firstly , the lower noise level in the brite data , which amounts to 72% between @xmath30and 80% between @xmath31of that in the combined @xmath32 ground - based multisite photometry ( jhs ) .",
    "the second factor is the evolution of the stellar pulsation amplitudes .",
    "such changes in the stellar mode spectrum make frequency analyses more challenging , but are also an asset as repeated observations may reveal more seismic information .",
    "unfortunately , the data set reported here can not be analysed together with those from the multisite campaigns carried out more than a decade ago ( jhs ) as the temporal gap between the two observational campaigns is too large , and just because the amplitude variations have occurred .",
    "however , at least some of the brite satellites will continue to observe @xmath1  eri , and eventually this gap can be bridged .",
    "we showed that the observed pulsational amplitude ratios for the strongest modes are consistent with their previous identifications .",
    "however , the amplitude - wavelength relation in visual passbands is flatter than that predicted from theory .",
    "although we can not offer a good explanation for this discrepancy at this point , we suggest that mode identification of @xmath0  cep stars should not be done in the optical alone ; a uv band or radial velocities are necessary .",
    "the pulsation amplitude - wavelength relation observed for @xmath1  eri requires theoretical explanation to derive reliable mode identifications from brite data alone .",
    "furthermore , the additional gravity modes detected in the present work call for explanation , as current pulsation models have difficulties to excite them . an upcoming theoretical study by daszyska - daszkiewicz et al .",
    "( 2016 ) will address these questions .",
