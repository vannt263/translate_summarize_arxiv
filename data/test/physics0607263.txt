    "the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is a classical hydrodynamic instability @xcite with relevance in such diverse fields as plasma physics , astrophysics , meteorology , geophysics , inertial confinement fusion and granular media , for a review see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "generically this instability develops if a layer of liquid is superimposed to an immiscible and less dense liquid such that the potential energy of the system can be reduced by interchanging the liquids .",
    "consequently , the initially plane interface between the liquids becomes unstable and the characteristic dimples and spikes develop resulting finally in a stable layering with the lighter fluid on top of the heavier one .",
    "a quantitative experimental investigation of the rayleigh - taylor instability requires reliable control of the initial condition .",
    "standard procedures like suddenly removed partitions between the fluids @xcite , @xcite or quickly turning the experimental cell upside down @xcite , @xcite clearly produce unpredictable initial perturbations .",
    "it is much more convenient to use some additional mechanism which first _ stabilizes _ the unstable layering of the liquids and may later be switched off instantaneously .",
    "it is well known that the rayleigh - taylor instability may be suppressed , e.g. , by vertical oscillation of the system @xcite , @xcite and by appropriate temperature gradients @xcite .",
    "the first mechanism is likely to induce uncontrolled initial surface deflections when stopped , in the second one it is difficult to abruptly switch off the stabilization .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the possibility to stabilize a potentially rayleigh - taylor unstable system involving a magnetic fluid by external magnetic fields .",
    "we will show that for experimentally relevant parameter values moderate fields strengths which can easily be switched on and off are sufficient to achieve the desired stabilization .",
    "magnetic fluids are suspensions of ferromagnetic nano - particles in carrier liquids with the hydrodynamic properties of newtonian fluids and the magnetic properties of super - paramagnets @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a magnetic field parallel to the plane interface between a ferrofluid and a non - magnetic fluid suppresses interface deflections with wave vector in the direction of the field @xcite .",
    "this may be used to stabilize the rayleigh - taylor instability in two - dimensional situations where the interface is line , as e.  g. in a hele - shaw cell . in the more natural three - dimensional",
    "setting we are interested in here a static magnetic field parallel to the undisturbed interface is not sufficient to stabilize the flat interface since perturbation with wave vectors _ perpendicular _ to the magnetic field will still grow as in the absence of the field .",
    "we therefore propose to use a spatially homogeneous magnetic field _ rotating _ in the plane of the undisturbed interface and determine appropriate values of the field amplitude and rotation frequency . an alternative possibility is to use a static _ inhomogeneous _ magnetic field with the magnetic force counterbalancing gravity @xcite .",
    "this method was used in @xcite to investigate the 2-d rayleigh - taylor instability in a hele - shaw cell .    before embarking upon the detailed analysis",
    "we would like to mention three characteristic features of our method .",
    "firstly , we will show that a rotating magnetic field is unable to suppress _ all _ possible unstable modes of the system .",
    "in fact it can only stabilize surface deflections with wavenumber modulus larger than some threshold value .",
    "perturbations with very long wavelength are , however , not a serious problem in real experiments because these are suppressed automatically by the finite geometry of the sample . secondly , it is well - known that in analogy with the faraday instability an oscillating magnetic field will induce _ new _ instabilities at wave numbers which without field were stable @xcite , @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we keep track of these unstable modes and determine the magnetic field strength such that no new instabilities may occur",
    ". for suppressing these new modes viscous losses in the liquids will be decisive which is the reason why the viscosities of the two liquids will be consistently taken into account in the analysis .",
    "finally , due to the dispersed magnetic grains ferrofluids have usually comparatively high densities .",
    "we therefore specialize to the case in which the upper , heavier layer is formed by the magnetic fluid",
    ". this should be the typical situation in experiments .",
    "nevertheless a similar analysis with analogous results is possible for the reverse situation with the ferrofluid at the bottom of the system superimposed by an even denser non - magnetic liquid .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we collect the basic equations and boundary conditions . in section iii",
    "we linearize these equations around the reference state of a plane interface between the liquids .",
    "section iv contains the floquet theory to determine the boundaries separating stable from unstable regions in the parameter plane . after shortly discussing two approximate treatments of the fluid viscosities in section v we present the results of our analysis in section vi .",
    "finally section vii contains some discussion .",

    "modes with @xmath155 are suppressed by surface tension .",
    "if one is able to temporarily stabilize the remaining modes by the rotating magnetic field , i.e. if one is able to realize @xmath156 the flat interface is stable . switching off the magnetic field at a given time all modes with @xmath157 will become unstable .",
    "since it is easily possible to realize values of @xmath139 significantly smaller than @xmath158 , the wavenumber with largest growth rate in the absence of the field , the ensuing rayleigh - taylor instability should closely resemble the case without lateral boundary conditions . to be precise",
    "it should be emphasized that our theoretical analysis is for infinite layers only and does not take into account the influence of lateral boundary conditions .",
    "however , the relevant values of @xmath138 and @xmath139 will only marginally be modified .    for an order of magnitude estimate let us consider a cylindrical vessel of diameter @xmath159 . pinning the contact line at the boundary",
    "the instability of modes with dimensionless wavenumber @xmath160 will be suppressed . on the other hand a rotating magnetic field with amplitude @xmath161 and",
    "frequency @xmath162 realizes @xmath163 ( cf .",

    "switching off the magnetic field all modes with @xmath157 will become unstable . for the above example this includes the first 8 cylindrical modes which should allow a rather accurate study of the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "we hope that our theoretical study may stimulate experimental work along these lines .",
