    "two bodies kept at different temperatures and separated by a vacuum gap experience a radiative heat transfer mediated by photons .",
    "this energy exchange is limited by the well known stefan - boltzmann s law in the far field , i.e. when the distance separating the bodies is large compared to the thermal wavelength @xmath0 , of the order of @xmath1 m at ambient temperature .",
    "the pioneering works of rytov  @xcite , polder and van hove  @xcite first showed that this limit can be surpassed in the near - field regime , as a result of the tunneling of evanescent waves .",
    "in particular , the heat transfer can exceed the one between two blackbodies ( i.e. the ideal far - field scenario predicted by stefan - boltzmann s law ) even of several orders of magnitue when the materials support surface resonances , such as plasmons in metals ( typically lying in the ultraviolet range of frequencies ) and phonon - polaritons in dielectrics ( typically in the infrared ) @xcite . since the contribution of each field mode to radiative heat transfer is weighted by the planck thermal distribution , negligible in the ultraviolet range at ordinary temperatures , dielectrics supporting surface resonances",
    "are typically the best candidates to maximize the heat flux .    stimulated by the theoretical developments ,",
    "several applications have been proposed for radiative heat transfer , ranging from thermophotovoltaic  @xcite or solar thermal  @xcite energy conversion , to heat - assisted data storage @xcite , nanoscale cooling  @xcite , and the recent emerging field of thermotronics @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "the theoretical predictions have been verified during the last decade both in the plane - plane and sphere - plane configuration , for a wide range of distances , going from some nanometers to several microns  @xcite .",
    "recently , the idea of manipulating the heat flux through the manipulation of some external parameters have attracted a remarkable attention .",
    "in fact , both the control of the overall value of the flux and its spectral properties can be extremely relevant for several applications , and in particular for energy conversion . in the spirit of a manipulation thourgh geometrical properties ,",
    "structured surfaces have been the topic of many theoretical investigations .",
    "more specifically , by considering both 1d and 2d periodic gratings , both the radiative heat transfer  @xcite and the casimir force at and out of thermal equilibrium  @xcite have been studied by employing a variety of theoretical approaches .",
    "it has been shown that gratings represent indeed a tool to modify , both by reducing and amplifying , radiative heat transfer , as well as to influence its spectral properties . concerning the casimir force",
    ", it must be mentioned that the force between a sphere and a dielectric  @xcite or a metallic  @xcite grating has been recently measured and theoretically investigated  @xcite .    in the domain of radiative heat transfer ,",
    "metallic gratings deserve ideed a special attention .",
    "in fact , although , as mentioned above , surface resonances for a metal typically have ultraviolet frequencies , the presence of a periodically structured pattern can result in the presence of new surface resonances , referred to a spoof plasmons  @xcite , whose frequency can be adjusted as a function of the grating parameters and can be brought , for realistic values of the grating lenghtscales , in the infrared region , thus contributing to the flux .",
    "based on this behavior , the authors of ref .",
    "have recently theoretically predicted a high enhancement of the flux between two identical gold gratings .",
    "a similar study has been performed for 1d and 2d metallic gratings in refs .  , and more recently in ref .  .",
    "in these papers the reflection upon each grating has been described by means of the fourier modal method ( fmm )  @xcite , equipped with the factorization rule introduced in ref .  .",
    "it is worth stressing that , since the radiative heat transfer is calculated as an integral with respect to both frequency and wavevector , the choice of the method used to derive the grating reflection operators can drastically affect the computational time as well as the results .",
    "this paper is precisely devoted to the study of radiative heat transfer between two gold gratings .",
    "we present and discuss a modification to the fmm technique , known as adaptive spatial resolution  @xcite ( we will in the following refer to this modified method as asr ) , a technique specifically introduced to accelerate the convergence .",
    "this method has also been shown to overcome the known instabilities appearing for metallic gratings  @xcite .",
    "with respect to previous works , we extend here this technique to deal with arbitrary conical incidence .",
    "based on this approach , we provide a detailed study of the influence of the grating depth on the overall value of the flux as well as on its spectral properties .",
    "we also compare our results to part of the works mentioned above on heat transfer between metallic gratings .",
    "we show that ( 1 ) the asr technique produces a dramatic increase of the convergence rate ( thus implying a drastic reduction of computational time ) and ( 2 ) the numerical results for heat transfer considerably differ from results previously obtained using the standard fmm .",

    "[ secintro ] we present our physical system , describing also our notation and main definitions . in sec .",
    "[ secmethods ] we discuss in detail the adaptive spatial resolution .",

    "[ secconcl ] some conclusive remarks .",
    "the system we are going to address consists of two 1d lamellar gratings separated by vacuum , as shown in fig .  [ figgeometry ] .",

    "based on eq .",
    ", the calculation of the flux @xmath45 is now reduced to the problem of describing the field reflection upon each grating .",
    "the details about the asr technique employed in this paper are discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "the physical system we consider is shown in fig .",
    "[ figgrating ] : it is a lamellar grating of period @xmath6 , invariant along the @xmath3 axis , with relative dielectric permittivity @xmath46 .",
    "the grating is inlayed between two homogeneous media whose permittivities are @xmath47 ( input medium ) and @xmath48 ( output medium ) .",
    "a monochromatic plane wave with frequency @xmath20 and parallel wavevector @xmath21 illuminates the structure . throughout the calculation ,",
    "the vacuum wave number is denoted by @xmath49 and we assume a time dependence of the form @xmath50 . the particularity of the asr @xcite is the use of a new coordinates system @xmath51 in which the coordinate in the @xmath2 direction is stretched around the permittivity discontinuities .",
    "this allows to better describe the permittivity jump , which is crucial in the case of metallic structures .",
    "below , we derive the metric tensor and write the maxwell s equations associated to the coordinates change",
    ". then we solve them in the three regions of space : @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "we conclude that the truncation order @xmath191 is large enough to assure a good convergence for the integrated flux using fmm .",
    "thus , the difference between our results and the ones of ref .   does not seem to originate from an insufficient truncation order .",
    "it is now instructive to investigate the evolution of the spectral properties of the heat flux as a function of the grating depth @xmath8 .",

    "nevertheless , this is not the case for two gold slabs , simply because the plasma frequency for gold is located well outside the window of frequencies contributing to the flux , defined by the planck function @xmath205 . as a result , the only non - monotonic behavior for the flux is observed in the low - frequency region @xmath206\\,$]rad",

    "the main feature of fig .",
    "[ figgrid ] is anyway the appearance of two peaks in the spectral flux , sign of the existence of two surface modes , whose frequency depends on the grating height , coherently with the fact that these are indeed spoof plamons .",
    "the participation of these new modes produces an overall flux amplification equal to 2 and 2.7 , respectively , for @xmath210 m and @xmath211 m .",
    "an analysis of panel ( c ) of the same figure shows that increasing @xmath8 produces both a decrease of the frequency of spoof - plasmon modes and an amplification of the peak height .",

    "we basically observe two resonances for @xmath213 m and @xmath214 m , while for @xmath215 m and @xmath216 m not only we start observing a comb of resonance frequencies , but we clearly see that the fact that they approach each other produces a constructive interference between them , increasing the overall value of @xmath204 in the frequency range considered .",
    "this is even more evident in fig .",
    "[ figgrid](f ) , where for @xmath217 m the frequency - comb behavior is manifest , as well as how this eventually produces a smooth asymptotic @xmath204 ( reached for @xmath218 mm ) which does not show any abrupt change with respect to @xmath20 .",

    "it is manifest that , while sharing the same qualitative behavior , the two curves considerably differ quantitatively , in particular in the region between the two main peaks . in order to try to explain this disagreement we have noticed that in one of their recent papers on this topic ( namely , ref .  )",
    ", the authors clearly state that the fact that the two structures coincide implies that the two reflection operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 are equal .",
    "as discussed above , this is actually not correct because of the fact that the unit polarization vector in tm polarization depends on the propagation direction @xmath161 .",
    "nevertheless , we have performed a new calculation for the same structure , using the asr with @xmath196 , but omitting the sign change we need to deduce @xmath27 from @xmath221 .",
    "the result so obtained is given by the blue dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ figspectrum ] and clearly shows an impressively increased agreement with the red points .",
    "thus , we interpret the difference between the two results as due to this sign change , missing in ref .   and related works .",
    "moreover , it must be stressed that the results presented in ref .   also show an oscillatory behavior in frequency , in particular in the region between the two main peaks , which is completely absent in the results obtained by exploiting the asr , both with and without the sign change . in our opinion , this oscillations are a result of the well - known instabilities of the fmm when dealing with metals .    with the aim of further trying to explain the discrepancy with ref .   shown in fig .",
    "[ figh ] , we have recalculated using the asr one of the points of fig .",
    "[ figh ] , the one having @xmath222 m , without the mentioned sign change .",
    "the result is the blue dot in fig .",
    "[ figh ] which , even if approaching the result of ref .  , still does not show a good agreement .",
    "we have addressed the caclulation of the radiative heat flux between two gold gratings . to this aim",
    "we have made use of the asr , a modified version of the fmm introduced to deal with the high dielectric contrast typical of metals .",
    "we have shown that this technique produces a striking increase of the convergence rate , allowing us to obtain the heat flux at a distance of 1@xmath223 m with a truncation order as low as @xmath196 .",
    "this implies a remarkable gain in computational time : to give an idea , for the grating parameters relative to fig .",
    "[ figfmmasr ] , the calculation of the spectral flux at frequency @xmath224rad / s takes approximately 1 minute using the asr with @xmath196 on a parallel 3.4ghz 16-core machine , while 1.5 hours are needed using the fmm with @xmath191 .",
    "since the required truncation order increases when decreasing the distance , the asr would allow to explore smaller separations , which would be prohibitive using the fmm .    by using this improved numerical method ,",
    "we have made a detailed study of the heat - flux amplification as a function of the grating depth . by studying both the flux ratio and",
    "the spectral properties , we have proved for our structure an amplification factor going up to 34 , explained in terms of the appearance of a comb of spoof - plasmon resonances .",
    "we have then compared our results to some previous works , and highlighted a quantitative disagreement both in the integrated flux and in its spectral distribution . in some cases ,",
    "we have argued that this disagreement is due to the incorrect assumption that the reflection matrices of the two gratings coincide .",
    "our results show that the physics behind metallic gratings makes them ideal candidates for the manipuation of both the overall heat flux and its frequency components , both possibilities being very relevant for several applications such as thermophotovoltaic energy conversion . on a more technical side",
    ", our discussion proves that the fmm can provide slowly - converging and unstable results in the presence of metals , while the asr represents a much more reliable approach even for high dielectric contrasts .",
