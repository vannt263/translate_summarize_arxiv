    "brownian motion is one of the most ubiquitous transport phenomena in nature , thermally induced molecular collisions in a solvent impart momentum to small particles and they hence acquire a random velocity @xcite . in over damped systems , where inertia is overcome by viscous damping , this velocity becomes rapidly uncorrelated in time . in this case the particle s velocity becomes an effective white noise and its position is what is mathematically known as pure brownian motion .",
    "the diffusion equation describing the probability density ( pdf ) of pure brownian motion in an isotropic medium in @xmath0 dimensions is @xmath1 the term @xmath2 above is the short time or microscopic diffusion constant .",
    "a key quantity which can be extracted from single particle tracking is the mean squared displacement ( msd ) whose average is given by @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the effective time dependent diffusion constant .",
    "the late time or effective diffusion constant is defined via the limit @xmath5 in the case of pure brownian motion we have @xmath6 .    in nature brownian particles also interact with their environment via long range interactions that can be generated by electrostatic and other interactions . as well as",
    "the noise leading to brownian motion , the particle also feels a force , or drift , due to this potential . for instant a particle diffusing in a cellular cytoplasm will locally diffuse , but also interact via steric interactions with the cells organelles .",
    "the local or short time diffusion constant is solely determined by the nature of the solvent , however at late times the diffusion constant will be modified due to the potential felt by the particle . in the presence of drift due to an external force",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath7 , _",
    "i.e. _ the small time limit of the effective diffusion constant is given by the microscopic diffusion constant .",
    "however at late times the diffusion constant will be modified by the potential acting on the particle .",
    "the value of @xmath8 can be computed exactly in one dimension for any potential @xcite . however , except for a particular case in two dimensions @xcite , in higher dimensions no results are known .",
    "the problem of diffusion in a random potential has been extensively studied , in the cases where the diffusion constant exists one can use field theoretic methods such as the perturbation theory and the renormalization group to estimate it for both gaussian @xcite and non - gaussian potentials @xcite .",
    "a review of these results can be found in @xcite .",
    "more recently , due to increasing interest in the physics of non - equilibrium steady states , there have been many studies of diffusion in tilted periodic potentials , which are periodic potentials plus a constant linear potential leading to an component with a constant applied force @xcite .",
    "the presence of a potential acting upon a brownian particle will cause the effective trajectory to be non - pure brownian and non - gaussian .",
    "the effective diffusion constant must switch over from the microscopic one to the effective one , meaning that @xmath4 will vary with time .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath9 , essentially due to trapping in the local minima of the potential , so @xmath4 must decrease with time toward its asymptotic value .",
    "consequently the msd is concave rather than linear as in the case of brownian motion , for instance see fig ( [ msd ] ) which is for particles diffusing in a cosine potential .",
    "the concave form of the msd is superficially reminiscent of the sub - diffusive behavior @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it is thus conceivable that a slow crossover from the microscopic diffusion constant to the effective one could be misconstrued as anomalous sub - diffusion if the trajectories are not observed over a time sufficient to attain the asymptotic linear diffusive regime of the msd .",
    "the nature of the cross over is thus important to understand , both for discerning between anomalous and ordinary diffusion and because the crossover may contain information about the potential that the particle is subjected to . in this paper",
    "we will address the question of how an ultimately diffusive system attains the diffusive regime .    to start with",
    ", we consider the finite time correction for continuous time random walks ( ctrw ) .",
    "the finite time corrections here are quite easy to compute but the results are nonetheless illuminating and somewhat surprising .",
    "furthermore , at a coarse grained level a brownian particle diffusing in a periodic potential can be viewed as a ctrw .",
    "we then use a kubo like formula , first given in @xcite , to analyze finite time corrections for diffusion in a periodic potential and give explicit results for the case of one dimension .",
    "our results are also verified with numerical simulations based on the direct integration of the langevin equation for an ensemble of tracer particles .",
    "to start with we consider the simple problem of ctrw in one dimensions on the set of integers .",
    "the waiting time at each site has the same distribution @xmath12 . after waiting for time @xmath13 at site @xmath14",
    "the process hops to the left or right with probability @xmath15 . in terms of the number of jumps @xmath16",
    "taken up till time @xmath17 the mean squared displacement is just given by @xmath18 where @xmath16 is itself a random variable depending on the waiting times , and the average @xmath19 is over the random variables corresponding to a jump to the left or right .",
    "the full average is given by @xmath20 where the average @xmath21 indicates the average with respect to the waiting times .",
    "now consider an exponentially distributed random time @xmath22 with rate @xmath23 .",
    "consider the random variable @xmath24 , the number of jumps made before the time @xmath22 occurs .",
    "the probability that a single jump occurs before time @xmath22 is given by @xmath25 which is given by @xmath26 were @xmath27 is the heaviside function and @xmath28 is the laplace transform of @xmath12 . now using the memoryless property of the exponential distribution we see that the probability that there are @xmath29 steps taken before @xmath22 is given by @xmath30 from which we find that @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the average over @xmath22 .",
    "recalling that the probability distribution function of @xmath22 is given by @xmath33 means that eq .",
    "( [ lt1 ] ) can be written as @xmath34 therefore @xmath35 where @xmath36 indicates the inverse laplace transform with respect to parameter @xmath23 .",
    "the late time behavior of the msd can be extracted from the small @xmath23 behavior of the laplace transform , where we can use @xmath37 in the case where the two first moments of the distribution for @xmath38 exist .",
    "this gives @xmath39\\right\\ } .\\ ] ] now inverting the laplace transform gives @xmath40 .\\ ] ] this means that asymptotically the msd is simply a straight line , measuring the slope gives the value of @xmath41 while the intercept with the @xmath42 axis gives @xmath43 .",
    "the msd is usually determined from a finite ensemble of trajectories and even from a single trajectory by slicing up the trajectory and using different points for the origin of the process .",
    "the resulting experimental curve can be fitted , for example using a least squares linear fit .",
    "immediately we see that the effective diffusion constant is given by @xmath44 which is intuitively obvious to understand , and shows the necessity of a finite average of @xmath38 to see diffusive behavior .",
    "an interesting point to make here is that in experiments one may not necessarily be able to obtain the temporal resolution necessary to see individual jumps and thus measure the average trapping time @xmath45 , however this can be obtained from the diffusion constant via eq .",
    "( [ eqdc ] ) .",
    "the time dependent diffusion constant @xmath4 therefore behaves at late times as @xmath46.\\ ] ] the late time correction to the diffusion constant can be positive or negative depending on the sign of @xmath47 usually in fitting procedures to estimate @xmath8 the value of the constant @xmath48 is ignored . here",
    "we see that it contains information about the variance of trapping times .",
    "using the estimate for @xmath45 from the fit of @xmath8 enables one to obtain and estimate for the variance @xmath49 from the estimate of @xmath48 .",
    "despite the simplicity of the above calculation , there are a number of interesting features which emerge . in the case where @xmath38 has an exponential distribution @xmath50",
    "we find that @xmath51 .",
    "however in this case we can find the full temporal dependence as @xmath52 which yields @xmath53 _ i.e. _ the asymptotic diffusive regime sets in immediately .",
    "we also note that the term @xmath48 can be written as @xmath54 where @xmath49 is the variance and @xmath55 is the corresponding coefficient of variation of the parental waiting - time distribution",
    ". therefore if @xmath38 has a large variance ( so that @xmath56 ) the late time correction to @xmath4 tends to be positive , however if the distribution is highly peaked ( and @xmath57 ) then the correction will be negative .",
    "the finite time correction for peaked distributions is easy to understand by considering the _ deterministic _ hopping case where @xmath58 up to an infinitesimal dispersion of the distribution about @xmath59 . working in terms of the average jump number we find that @xmath60 however we know that @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the non - integer part of @xmath63 .",
    "the temporal average value of of this term is given by , @xmath64 which trivially explains the result for very peaked distributions , the constant @xmath48 is essentially negative due to the rounding effect of a discrete random walk .",
    "another distribution which is interesting to analyze is the power law distribution given by @xmath65 with @xmath59 a cut - off timescale below which @xmath66 .",
    "the above analysis above goes through when @xmath67 is finite , that is when @xmath68 . in this case",
    "we find @xmath69 therefore there is a window of values of @xmath70 such that @xmath71 such that @xmath72 , and for all other values of @xmath73 we have @xmath74 .",
    "now consider the case where @xmath75 that is to say the mean exists but the variance diverges . in this case",
    "we find that @xmath76 now in the limit where @xmath77 we can approximate the above by @xmath78 as the integral on the left hand side converges around @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "this gives , for late times , @xmath81 where @xmath82 this can then be simplified , using the factorial property of the gamma function @xmath83 , to obtain @xmath84 we see that as the diffusion tends towards the point where it becomes anomalous ( sub - diffusive ) , the finite time corrections become more important .",
    "this is thus an example of a censorship phenomenon for the transition between diffusive and sub - diffusive transport .",
    "as the transition is approached the finite time corrections to the msd decay more and more slowly and become of the order of the leading , diffusive , term .",
    "the effective diffusion constant close to the transition point thus becomes impossible to measure if one does not know how to include finite time corrections in the fitting procedure used to extract @xmath8 .",
    "a concrete example of this was demonstrated for the case of a particle diffusing in a potential given by the square of a gaussian function @xcite , a system which exhibits a transition from a normal to anormal diffusive regime .",
    "consider now the case @xmath85 , where @xmath48 in eq .",
    "is equal to zero , and address the question of the thermalization dynamics for this _ critical _ value of @xmath70 . for @xmath86 ,",
    "i.e. when the second moment of the waiting time distribution in eq .",
    "exists , while the third one does not , we have @xmath87 where @xmath88 consequently , we have that for @xmath86 , @xmath89 upon inverting the laplace transform we find that @xmath90 -{\\tau_0^\\alpha t^{2-\\alpha}\\over\\overline \\tau^2   ( \\alpha-1)(\\alpha-2)}.\\ ] ] the latter equation implies that in the critical case @xmath85 the long - time relaxation proceeds as @xmath91 i.e. , the diffusion coefficient approaches its equilibrium value from below and as a power - law with the exponent @xmath92 .",
    "we note that a similar _ singular _ behavior - i.e. , the change of the dynamical exponent characteristic of the thermalization kinetics - is not specific to the power - law distribution in eq . but may show up for any underlying waiting - time distribution @xmath12 in which , by tuning some parameters , one manages to tune the coefficient of variation @xmath93 of the underlying distribution @xmath12 to be equal to @xmath94 .",
    "now having considered the finite time correction for continuous time random walks on discrete space , where we have seen that the spatial discreteness can lead to a trivial rounding type error , let us consider a langevin process diffusing in a periodic potential .",
    "here we examine a locally brownian particle whose probability density function ( pdf ) obeys the fokker - planck equation @xmath95 here @xmath96 is a potential which is periodic and finite , so the diffusion constant at late times exists . in any dimension the late time effective diffusion constant",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath97 this result can be demonstrated by adapting a method introduced by derrida @xcite for discrete random walks to the case of langevin processes @xcite or by direct manipulation of the langevin equation @xcite to obtain a kubo - like formula for the late time diffusion constant .",
    "however , if we consider a periodic potential in a region of space much larger than the period length and assume that the particle is in equilibrium ( specifically we mean that the position of the particle modulo the period is in equilibrium ) , it can be shown , directly from the langevin equation @xcite , that @xmath98({\\bf x } , { \\bf x}_0)\\cdot \\nabla \\phi({\\bf x}_0 ) p_{eq}({\\bf x}_0).\\label{eftc}\\ ] ] in the above , @xmath99 is the equilibrium probability distribution over a region of large but finite size @xmath100 .    to start our analysis of these formulas we start by considering the correction to the late time , effective , diffusion constant by the presence of a potential in one dimension .",
    "we write @xmath101 where @xmath102 and where the equilibrium distribution over the interval @xmath103 $ ] is given by @xmath104 in the above we have defined the spatial average of the boltzmann weight @xmath105 now we define @xmath106 and thus @xmath107 obeys @xmath108 this second order differential equation can be integrated to give @xmath109,\\label{solf}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are two integration constants that must be determined . to determine the constants we now consider a periodic potential with period @xmath112 such that @xmath113 .",
    "the function @xmath107 must therefore be periodic with the same period , and this gives @xmath114 at this point we do no have to identify the constant @xmath111 as we have @xmath115 and the term proportional to @xmath111 in @xmath116 will contribute @xmath117 to @xmath118 due to the periodicity of the potential . performing the integrals we find @xmath119 which simplifies to give @xmath120 and , eventually , @xmath121 this is a standard result on one dimensional diffusion which has been known for a long time and has been derived with a wide variety of different methods @xcite .",
    "interestingly the derivation we present here is based on the direct evaluation of the msd , whereas in all the other derivations we are aware of @xcite a mean first passage time argument is used and then turned around to give the diffusion constant .",
    "we now consider the finite time corrections .",
    "our results on ctrws suggest that the first term in the finite time integral eq .",
    "( [ eftc ] ) will be the leading correction , _",

    "another interesting feature of this formula for @xmath48 is that it is independent of @xmath2 .",

    "is given by @xmath162    we therefore see that the diffusion constant at low temperatures is dominated by an arrhenius like term involving the maximal energy barrier in the system , while the prefactors depends on the curvature of the maximum and minimum of the potential .",

    "an example is shown in fig ( [ msd ] ) .",
    "we see that after a certain time the msd curve becomes linear , in this case for @xmath168 . from the linear fit in this region the resulting estimates for @xmath8 and @xmath48",
    "are extracted and we find that they are in excellent agreement with our analytical predictions .",
    "the explicit calculations carried out here are of course relevant to one dimension .",

    "namely , one gets a very different values of @xmath48 for @xmath189 and @xmath188 , so that studying the amplitude of the relaxation term we can distinguish between diffusion in presence of barriers or and diffusion in presence of wells .",

    "are subjected to external forces and this extra drift means that they do not behave as pure brownian motion .",
    "the effect of interaction means that the average msd only becomes proportional to @xmath17 at late times . in this region",
    "the diffusion constant can be extracted via a fitting procedure , for instance a linear fit ( which may not necessarily be the best way to fit such data @xcite ) will yield a slope proportional to @xmath41 and also a constant @xmath43 where it intercepts the vertical axis . if the particle is brownian in an external conservative force field ,",
    "we have shown that this constant must be positive and in one dimension we have found an analytical expression for it .",
    "we believe that these results could be useful in analyzing single particle tracking data , as the constant term , which is usually ignored or not discussed , contains potentially interesting information about the potential landscape seen by the brownian particle .",
    "in particular we have seen that at low temperatures , knowing @xmath48 enables one to estimate the curvature of the local minima of the potential responsible for slowing diffusion down , while in the kramers expression for the diffusion constant this information is mixed with the arrhenius term which contains information about the energy barrier .",
    "a number of questions remain open , here we have examined the leading order correction to the average msd which turns out to be a constant .",
    "the next order corrections would be interesting to analyze as they would allow one to estimate when one achieves the effective linear regime of asymptotic diffusion .",
    "another important question is what happens in the case where the potential is not periodic but say , for instance , random but statistically stationary . in this case",
    "the leading order correction is probably time dependent @xcite .",

    "<S> a langevin process diffusing in a periodic potential landscape has a time dependent diffusion constant which means that its average mean squared displacement ( msd ) only becomes linear at late times . </S>",
    "<S> the long time , or effective diffusion constant , can be estimated from the slope of a linear fit of the msd at late times . </S>",
    "<S> due to the cross over between a short time microscopic diffusion constant , which is independent of the potential , to the effective late time diffusion constant , a linear fit of the msd will not in general pass through the origin and will have a non - zero constant term . here </S>",
    "<S> we address how to compute the constant term and provide explicit results for brownian particles in one dimension in periodic potentials . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the constant is always positive and that at low temperatures it depends on the curvature of the minimum of the potential . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the same question for the simpler problem of a symmetric continuous time random walk in discrete space . here </S>",
    "<S> the constant can be positive or negative and can be used to determine the variance of the hopping time distribution . </S>"
