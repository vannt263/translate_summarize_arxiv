    "dileptons produced in heavy ion collisions interact only electromagnetically with their hadronic surroundings . especially the early phases of such collisions , when dilepton production rates are largest ,",
    "can therefore be explored with lepton pairs .",
    "some of the initial ideas on photon @xcite and dilepton @xcite @xcite emission have met with considerable interest , and this area has now expanded into a major component of research in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite . on the experimental side , dilepton experiments for hadronic collisions",
    "@xcite@xcite have been complemented only recently by nucleus - nucleus experiments at very high energies @xcite@xcite .",
    "since the spectrum of lepton pairs and of real photons has been proposed as a signature of the quark - gluon plasma @xcite , it is imperative quantitatively to understand the emission mechanisms from the confined sector of qcd , which in this sense constitutes the background .    guided by theoretical estimates",
    ", we can roughly divide the lepton pair production cross section , expressed in terms of its invariant mass @xmath1 , into a number of distinct regions . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the drell - yan contribution dominates , while pairs arising from the semileptonic decay of @xmath3 are also important @xcite . for lepton",
    "pair invariant masses around the light vector meson masses ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) , two - body @xcite and three - body @xcite reactions dominate .",
    "the latter processes also extend their influence to the region @xmath7 , where the quark - gluon plasma may become visible for sufficiently high initial temperatures @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on the regions of low invariant masses , the so - called `` soft '' limit @xmath8 mev . there ,",
    "production via bremsstrahlung is expected to play an important role and many authors have recently concerned themselves with such reactions @xcite@xcite .",
    "since particle production plays an important role in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , we consider only events that arise from microscopic meson - meson dynamics . in high energy",
    "heavy ion experiments , the meson to baryon ratio is such that the absence of baryons in our treatment is not expected to constitute a major hurdle to phenomenology . more specifically , we restrict our studies to those of pion - pion bremsstrahlung .",
    "the production of photons or dileptons necessarily involves 3- or 4-particle final states . except for special cases such as cross sections at fixed @xmath9 @xcite ,",
    "such final states have universally been handled under some approximation .",
    "it is our goal in this paper to go beyond these by presenting an essentially exact formulation for the @xmath10 cross section ( as a function of dilepton invariant mass ) and , in the process , to test how far these approximations may be trusted . in order to achieve these goals , we formulate the pion - pion interaction in terms of a relativistic one boson exchange model ( obe ) .    note that we do not attempt to compare directly to experimental data because the main point at issue is a comparison of theoretical approaches to bremsstrahlung . to do justice to small-@xmath1 data",
    "would require spacetime integration over the fireball region as well as inclusion of dalitz decays and the landau - pomeranchuk effect , a substantial task which will be postponed to future work .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we discuss the set of approximations known under the collective banner of the soft photon aproximation ( spa ) .",
    "next , we derive exact formulae for the bremsstrahlung generation of lepton pairs .",
    "section [ sec : threesp ] is devoted to technical issues having to do with phase space ; sections [ sec : curint ] and [ sec : xsexact ] then derive cross sections based respectively on various spa variants and the exact formulation .",
    "our obe model is presented in section [ sec : fullobe ] ; finally , section [ sec : results ] contains our numerical results in the form of cross sections @xmath11 and rates @xmath12 and a discussion on the issues raised .",
    "the soft photon approximation ( spa ) has been widely used in calculating bremsstrahlung dilepton spectra .",
    "it is based on the early realization @xcite that the cross section for production of low - energy real photons is dominated by the corresponding hadronic amplitude . in practice , this means neglecting the photon momentum in the hadronic matrix element as well as all photon emission from vertices and internal lines ( see section [ sec : spa ] ) .      in order for the spa to be a valid approximation , two conditions @xcite",
    "must be met :    1 .   the photon energy must be much smaller than the energy of any one of the hadrons participating in the scattering , @xmath13 2 .",
    "the process of radiating the photon must be separable from the hadronic interaction process , i.e.  the hadronic and electromagnetic time and distance scales must be sufficiently different to permit separate treatment .",
    "the range of the hadron - hadron interaction is given roughly by @xmath14 , the inverse mass of the exchange boson , while the distance the hadron may propagate with off - shell energy @xmath15 before emitting the photon is about @xmath16 .",
    "the spa is valid only when @xmath17 , or @xmath18    implicit in these equations is , of course , a specific lorentz frame with respect to which the energies are measured .",
    "for the special case where two hadrons of equal mass @xmath19 collide , these conditions can be re - written in their cms frame as @xmath20 in a simple bremsstrahlung experiment , these limits are easily satisfied by selecting only photons or dileptons of low energy in the laboratory frame .",
    "an early dilepton paper by rckl , for example @xcite , calculated spectra for @xmath21 and @xmath22 gev while restricting transverse momentum to below 500 mev .    in the complex multiparticle systems formed in the course of nucleus - nucleus collisions ,",
    "however , the situation is more complicated : there are many binary collisions , and their respective cms frames do not generally coincide either with one another or with the overall nucleus - nucleus cms frame . a photon that is soft in a particular hadron - hadron cms therefore does not have to be soft in the laboratory and vice versa .",
    "( this fact has to be taken into account when addressing issues related to the spectrum of real photons @xcite . )    in a situation where there are many cms frames , it therefore becomes necessary to look at relativistically invariant quantities .",
    "for lepton pairs , the extra degree of freedom provided by a non - vanishing invariant mass is a suitable variable of choice . looking at invariant masses means , however , that @xmath23 is no longer fixed but must vary over its full kinematic range , which for our example of colliding equal - mass hadrons is given by ( see section [ sec : curint ] ) @xmath24 once the upper kinematic limit for @xmath23 approaches or exceeds the bounds set by either eq .",
    "( [ iad ] ) or ( [ iae ] ) , the soft photon approximation clearly fails .    in figure 1",
    ", we show the three functions ( [ iad ] ) and ( [ iae ] ) and ( [ iah ] ) for the case @xmath25 mev , @xmath26 mev and dilepton invariant masses @xmath27 and @xmath28 mev .",
    "it is immediately clear that the assumptions underlying the spa are not fulfilled even for small @xmath1 : the kinematic range accessible to @xmath23 is never much smaller than the limits set by the spa .",
    "the situation becomes even worse for larger @xmath1 .",
    "closely related to the above is a common misconception that the spa must necessarily be valid for small invariant masses .",
    "the confusion stems from the fact that , because @xmath29 a small value for @xmath23 necessarily implies small @xmath1 .",
    "however , the reverse is not true : both @xmath23 and @xmath9 can be large even while adding up to small @xmath1 .",
    "an extreme counterexample is of course a hard real photon with zero invariant mass but large energy .",
    "one can not , therefore , a priori expect spa calculations to coincide with full hadronic calculations even when @xmath1 is small .",
    "section [ sec : results ] provides examples of such deviations ; see especially the ratios between approximations and the exact calculation in figures 12 and 13 which do not approach unity for small @xmath1 .",
    "this point has been emphasized before @xcite .",
    "we are therefore led to conclude that the spa does not generally apply to rates or cross sections measured in terms of the dilepton invariant mass .",
    "correspondingly , doubt must be cast on the validity of the spa in calculations pertaining to such measurements .",
    "that said , one may still ask _ by how much _ spa - based calculations differ from the more complicated true situation : is it a matter of a few percent , or orders of magnitude ?",
    "full calculations such as presented in section [ sec : fullobe ] below are cumbersome and time - consuming , and it is therefore of value to understand quantitatively to what percentage the spa approximation can be trusted .",
    "it is this _ quantitative _ question that we attempt to cast some light on by making a model calculation capable both of `` true '' answers and an spa approximation .",
    "clearly , a single model calculation such as presented below can not answer this quantitative question exhaustively .",
    "nevertheless , its results provide at least an indicator of the reliability of the spa : if , within our simple obe , dileptons can or can not reasonably be described within the spa , it is possible or even likely that the same or similar conclusions would emerge from other models .      rather than being just a single step , the soft photon approximation as implemented in a practical context can consist of a number of stages . starting with the most fundamental ,",
    "these are :    1 .",
    "the virtual photon producing the lepton pair is emitted only by external legs of the hadronic reaction ; emission from internal parts of the hadronic reaction is neglected because the radiation from internal lines forms a sub - leading contribution @xcite .",
    "2 .   the dependence of the hadronic matrix element @xmath30 on the photon momentum @xmath31 is neglected .",
    "3 .   the photon momentum @xmath31 is neglected in the phase space delta functions .",
    "in addition , we shall be considering in this paper the effect of    1 .   approximating the virtual photon current by the real photon current , ( @xmath32 ;",
    "see eqs .",
    "( [ brk ] ) and ( [ brl ] ) ) .",
    "\\(a ) and ( b ) have formed the basis for most bremsstrahlung dilepton calculations as they are hard to avoid .",
    "the restriction of phase space ( c ) , on the other hand , can be circumvented fairly easily by inserting later a phase space correction factor ( section [ sec : ruckl ] ) or by avoiding ( c ) altogether using eqs .",
    "( [ brv ] ) , ( [ fcm ] ) and sections [ sec : threesp ] and [ sec : xsexact ] .    the change from virtual to real photon currents in step ( d ) is not directly dependent on ( c ) and can be implemented either jointly or separately .",
    "we shall be investigating both alternatives and determining their impact on the overall dilepton rate . in section",
    "[ sec : fullcross ] and section [ sec : fullobe ] and beyond , we shall refrain from using even the basic assumptions ( a ) and ( b ) and calculate exact cross sections and rates within the same lagrangian .",
    "we wish to find the cross section for a dilepton pair @xmath33 emitted in the semi - elastic scattering of two pions @xmath34 and @xmath35 into @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 the lepton pair forms via a virtual photon @xmath39 with four - momentum @xmath40 and mass @xmath41 emitted from either the central blob or external legs of the hadronic reaction @xmath42 the leading contribution will come from photon emission from external pion legs .",
    "first , we follow lichard @xcite in a leading - terms derivation but place more emphasis on the role of phase space ; the full formalism supplanting the leading - terms derivation is presented in section [ sec : fullcross ] .",
    "four diagrams contribute to the leading - term cross section , one of which is shown in figure 2 . in the notation of figure 2",

    "again , the fit is reasonably good , but the strong dependence on momentum - dependent terms in the @xmath192 propagator shows up in the region above the @xmath192 peak .",
    "best - fit values for the free parameters now are : @xmath202 mev , @xmath203 mev , @xmath204 mev ; @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 . throughout",
    ", we take @xmath208 mev .    for the current - based approximations of section [ sec : curint ] , the above lagrangian is all we need ; for the complete cross section of section [ sec : xsexact ] , it must be augmented by internal photon emission pieces",
    ". this can be achieved by minimal substitution , thereby guaranteeing gauge invariance ( for a similar approach , see the `` quantum hadrodynamics '' lagrangians of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to the hadronic lagrangian ( [ rtb ] ) we therefore add @xmath209 details regarding these pieces and corresponding vertex factors can be found in the appendix .",
    "the @xmath210 interaction results in a modified strong form factor for @xmath130- or @xmath198-channel charged @xmath4 exchange . if @xmath211 and @xmath212 are the usual form factors at the @xmath213 and @xmath214 vertices respectively , with @xmath215 , electromagnetic gauge invariance requires that the form factor for the emission of a photon by the @xmath4 be @xmath216 where @xmath217 and @xmath218 are the respective @xmath4 propagators . for the monopole form ( [ rth ] ) of",
    "@xmath219 this becomes @xcite @xmath220 note that we do not include strict vector meson dominance coupling of the photons to vector mesons .",
    "this is equivalent to the introduction of electromagnetic form factors .",
    "for the specific application we are considering , small @xmath1 s , those would be @xmath221 1 . for previous obe models ,",
    "see e.g.  refs.@xcite and references therein .",
    "to summarize : the differential cross section for dilepton production as a function of invariant mass , @xmath222 , can be found in a number of approximations and an exact way ( within the limitations of the hadronic reaction model ) .",
    "the approximations are : the rckl approximation ( [ ick ] ) , two approximations , eqs .  ( [ icklz ] ) and ( [ icklo ] ) , based on a more careful derivation by lichard , using the real and virtual photon currents respectively , and an approximation integrating the current covariantly in 3-phase space , eq .  ( [ bvp ] ) .",
    "the `` exact '' formula is given by eq .",
    "( [ xxc ] ) .    of these",
    ", the rckl and lichard cross sections can be found easily and quickly within 2-phase space .",
    "the 3-phase space current approximation is somewhat more difficult but still uses 2-phase space hadronic matrix elements . implementing the exact formulation ( [ xxc ] ) involves much more effort : if there are @xmath223 diagrams contributing to a given reaction , the sum in ( [ xxc ] ) contains @xmath224 terms .",
    "since an individual term @xmath225 in ( [ xxb ] ) is itself a dirac sum , only partial factorization of the overall sum is possible .",
    "further complications arise from the presence of imaginary pieces in the matrix elements .    to quantify the differences between the approximations and the exact formulation , we have studied all five distinct pion - pion reactions .",
    "writing @xmath226 as shorthand for the reaction @xmath227 and so on , we have calculated within our obe model cross sections for @xmath226 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "a total of 36 diagrams contribute at tree level to the first two reactions ( 24 for @xmath39 emitted by external pion lines , 12 by vertices and the exchange meson ) ; the remaining reactions are made up of 16 diagrams each ( 8 external , 8 internal ) .",
    "numerical results were checked by performing the following consistency checks : setting @xmath232 , @xmath233 , @xmath234 , @xmath235 and @xmath236 in the _ hadronic _ part of the exact matrix elements ( while keeping these variables where they enter the `` current '' part ) and using only the external - emission diagrams reproduces exactly the results of the 3-phase space integrated current ( [ bvp ] ) .",
    "gauge invariance in the @xmath188 , @xmath4 and @xmath192 fields provided another sensitive test .",
    "figures 59 show the cross sections for these five reactions as a function of @xmath237 . in every case ,",
    "the left and right panels show @xmath238 for @xmath27 mev and 300 mev respectively .",
    "final - state symmetrization factors were included where appropriate .",
    "initial - state symmetrization was also included for @xmath228 and @xmath230 in order to facilitate use within a thermal pion gas environment .",
    "when the initial - state pions are considered distinguishable , these two cross sections should be multiplied by a factor 2 for these reactions .",
    "because they are identical in structure to their charge - conjugate versions , cross sections for the reactions @xmath231 and @xmath228 were doubled  this , too , should be corrected for when desired .    to prevent overcrowding , only the rckl plus the virtual-@xmath39 current approximations ( [ icklo ] ) and ( [ bvp ] )",
    "are shown , together with the exact calculations .",
    "all these were computed using the same obe model and parameter values specified in section [ sec : fullobe ] above .    in the complicated structures and deviations in figs .",
    "59 , the following points are of interest :    1 .",
    "the @xmath4 peak in the reaction @xmath226 is overestimated by a factor 2.5 and 1.5 by the rckl and lichard approximations respectively for @xmath27 mev ; for @xmath239 mev , the overestimation is much greater ( figure 5 ) .",
    "only the 3-space current approximation does an adequate job here .",
    "similarly , the @xmath192 peak of the exact result lies well below the corresponding approximations .",
    "overestimation ( 1.75.0 ) of the @xmath4 peak also occurs for approximations in @xmath231 .",
    "2 .   in the reaction @xmath231 , the 3-space current approximation ,",
    "on the other hand , lies well below the exact result ( figure 6 ) .",
    "overestimation factors for @xmath238 are of order 0.54 for the reactions @xmath230 and @xmath229 , depending on approximation and cms energy . here , too , the 3-space current approximation generally does better than the others but again tends to underestimate in some parts ( figs .  7 , 8) .",
    "the largest discrepancy between approximations and the exact result occur for the reaction @xmath228 ( figure 9 ) : for the rckl approximation , factors 3 ( for 10 mev ) to 30 ( for 300 mev ) arise , while the lichard approximation yields corresponding overestimation factors of 1.9 and 1420 .",
    "since , however , this reaction contributes only little when contributions from all reactions are added up , this effect is not of much interest in a heavy - ion context . 5 .",
    "there is generally not much difference between using the real - photon ( not shown ) or virtual - photon currents in the lichard approximations ; this is in agreement with the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite . for @xmath239 mev",
    ", some differences can be discerned , but both deviate in general more from the exact result than from each other",
    ".    figures 10 and 11 show the dilepton production rates per unit spacetime summed over all seven reactions , calculated using the boltzmann formula ( [ rtk ] ) , for temperatures @xmath240 and 200 mev respectively .",
    "these temperatures probably lie below and above an expected transition to a new quark - gluon phase and so represent extrema in their behavior . corresponding ratios of approximation over exact rates are shown in figures 12 and 13 . the rckl approximation is the worst , as expected ; overestimation is in the range 24 for @xmath240 mev , and 28 for @xmath241 mev .",
    "the lichard approximations overestimate by factors 1.44 , depending on temperature and @xmath94 . here ,",
    "the _ real-@xmath242 _",
    "3-phase space current , the lower of the two dotted lines , does surprisingly well , deviating from the exact result by less than 20% throughout .",
    "comparing this fact , however , with the substantial deviations shown in the @xmath94-differential cross sections of figs .",
    "59 , one must conclude that much of the `` agreement '' seen on the level of rates is due to averaging over differences seen in the @xmath94-dependent cross sections and that such `` agreement '' therefore does not validate the approximations .",
    "we also note the fact that none of the approximations approaches the exact result for small values of @xmath1 : even for the smallest value shown ( @xmath27 mev ) , the discrepancy is still above 40% for the lichard approximations and larger than a factor 2 for the rckl approximation .",
    "figure 14 shows the fractional contributions to the total @xmath243 mev rate for the rckl , virtual-@xmath242 current lichard , and exact cross sections .",
    "as discussed , the @xmath228 contribution virtually falls away in the exact calculation ; by contrast the reaction @xmath231 plus charge conjugate becomes more important , in second place behind the dominant reaction @xmath226 .    finally , we ask where the discrepancies between approximations and exact cross section originate : is this due to the inclusion of diagrams with photon emission from vertices and propagators ?",
    "a partial answer is provided by figure 15 , where the cross sections for reactions @xmath244 and @xmath229 are plotted .",
    "the upper lines correspond , as before , to the rckl and two lichard approximations , while the solid line again represents the exact result .",
    "the lowest dash - dotted line , on the other hand , represents the exact result but excluding all internal diagrams and their cross terms with external ones .",
    "the difference between this lower line and the exact result ( solid line ) therefore represents the contribution of the internal diagrams ; while the difference between the lower dash - dotted line and the upper lines ( approximations ) represents the change in cross section due to inclusion / exclusion of @xmath31 in the _ external_-emission diagrams .",
    "we see that the contribution of internal emission is not all that large , albeit nonnegligible . by far",
    "the most important effect on @xmath238 is the inclusion of the full dependence of @xmath245 on the photon momentum @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , the effect is so large that for the reaction @xmath228 the cross section would become negative if internal diagrams were not included ! in other words , among the list of approximations listed in section [ sec : spa ] , approximation ( b ) is the most far - reaching .    the importance of including @xmath31 fully in the matrix element can be understood qualitatively : as illustrated in figs .",
    "59 for one reaction , the elastic pion - pion cross sections vary considerably within the region of interest . adding or subtracting a sizeable amount of energy - momentum in the form of @xmath31",
    "therefore naturally leads to a substantial change in cross section also .",
    "this change is , however , neglected in all the approximations listed : there are no resonances in the cross section which could provide some amount of cancellation by pion - pion reactions being `` shifted into '' and `` shifted out of '' a resonance peak . ] .",
    "we believe that this ( unavoidable ) neglect is at the heart of the considerable differences between approximations and exact result seen in figs .  59 .    in summary ,",
    "the various approximations for bremsstrahlung from pion - pion collisions can not in general be believed beyond at best a factor 2 or more , depending on invariant mass and temperature .",
    "we have shown in sections [ sec : fullcross ] and [ sec : xsexact ] how 3-phase space can be fully taken into account .",
    "the most important effect , it turns out , is not the inclusion of photon emission from vertices or propagators but the strong dependence of the cross section on the inclusion of the photon momentum @xmath31 into the _ hadronic _",
    "collision part .",
    "since this calculation neglected baryonic degrees of freedom and resonances , and because of the technical difficulties of a further integration over spacetime , our results are not applied directly to experimental data ; this is a matter for the future .",
    "all we can say at this stage is that it is likely that the approximations overestimate the dilepton yield throughout the mass region of interest , and that the degree of overestimation rises both with increasing invariant mass @xmath1 and temperature @xmath95 . since the bremsstrahlung channel competes with various dalitz decays , and since various experiments take much care in applying cuts to eliminate dalitz pairs as far as possible @xcite a quantitative estimate would necessarily have to take such experimental cuts into account also .",
    "in addition , attention should be paid to the issue of the landau - pomeranchuk effect , which is expected to suppress dilepton bremsstrahlung rates @xcite .",
    "our results , taken in conjunction with these calculations , therefore appear to indicate even larger suppression of bremsstrahlung dileptons than had been thought previously .",
    "we thank p.  lichard for enlightening discussions and his careful derivation of dilepton formulas .",
    "thanks to a.  drees , j.  zhang , j.  c.  pan , p.  lipa and b.  buschbeck for useful discussions .",
