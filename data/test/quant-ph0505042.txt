    "the imaginary time path integral @xcite has provided a useful framework suitable for numerical analyses of quantum statistical - mechanical systems . most of the static properties of quantum systems can be calculated by means of the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) or path integral molecular dynamics ( pimd ) technique @xcite . however , it is not straightforward to apply the pimc / pimd methods to computing dynamical properties such as the real time quantum correlation function @xmath2 .",
    "this is because it is nontrivial to construct real time quantities from a finite number of imaginary time data obtained numerically @xcite . to overcome such difficulty , a number of promising methods of numerical analytic continuation based on the maximum entropy method",
    "have been proposed and applied to various many - body systems @xcite .",
    "recently , the centroid molecular dynamics ( cmd ) method @xcite , the ring polymer molecular dynamics ( rpmd ) method @xcite , and the effective potential analytic continuation ( epac ) method @xcite have been proposed as new quantum dynamics methods to calculate real time quantum correlation functions at finite temperature .",

    "the epac is a method to obtain the real time quantum correlation function @xmath2 by means of the effective action formalism @xcite and an analytic continuation procedure @xcite .",
    "it has been shown analytically that all these methods are exact in harmonic systems for the real time quantum correlation functions of a linear function of the position operator , @xmath4 @xcite . however , for nonlinear operators such as @xmath5",
    ", it is nontrivial whether these quantum dynamics methods yield the exact result even in harmonic systems @xcite .",
    "this is the _ nonlinear operator problem _ in quantum dynamics methods .    from a practical point of view",
    ", the nonlinear operator problem is a quite important subject to be tackled . in many problems of chemical interest ,",
    "the real time correlation functions of nonlinear operators are often needed for the calculation of various dynamical properties @xcite .",
    "for example , the cmd has been applied to the calculation of the transport coefficients such as thermal conductivity , shear viscosity , and bulk viscosity of quantum liquid parahydrogen @xcite .",
    "here it is found that the calculated transport properties are in good agreement with the experimental data . however , there is no rigorous theoretical basis for applying the cmd method to such properties represented by means of the correlation functions involving operators nonlinear in @xmath0 ( or momentum operator @xmath6 )",
    ". therefore we need , in general , a quantum dynamics method which is theoretically valid even for the time correlation functions of nonlinear operators .",
    "the present status of the nonlinear operator problem in the three quantum dynamics methods , cmd , rpmd , and epac , is summarized as follows . for the cmd method ,",

    "as for our epac method , the nonlinear operator problem has not been examined yet .",
    "in addition to these three methods , a theoretical approach based on the quantum mode - coupling theory has been applied to study the dynamical properties involving nonlinear operators in quantum liquids @xcite .    in the present paper , we develop the method of the epac for the calculation of the real time quantum correlation function involving the nonlinear operator @xmath5 . as a simple example , at first we show the epac correlation function @xmath8 for a harmonic oscillator comparing with the results of the cmd and the rpmd .",
