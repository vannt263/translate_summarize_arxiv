    "a second important test is that perturbed s that are not  s should be observed . finally , if the s are primarily due to lenses in a single binary population , several consistency checks are possible .",

    "it is easier to detect these discrepancies when the peak  is large .",
    "in fact , depending on the photometry and frequency of sampling , the distance of closest approach to a point lens needs to be @xmath56 in order for blending to be detected using the  alone (  & esin 1995 , wozniak & paczyski 1997 ) .",
    "when the lens is a binary , the enhancement in peak  associated with s can provide an ideal opportunity to look for blending .",
    "indeed , during the first few years of observations ,  s were the only known blended s , and to date , all  s are blended .",
    "the importance of the role of blending can be tested in many ways .",
    "( see , e.g. ,  & esin 1995 ; kamionkowski 1995 ; buchalter , kamionkowski , & rich 1996 ; wozniak & paczyski 1997 ; goldberg , wozniak , & paczyski 1997 ; goldberg 1998 ; goldberg & wozniak 1998 ; han 1998 ) indeed , by using using the image subtraction method to re - examine the ogle team s bulge data , alard finds that the fraction of s exhibiting signs of blending is consistent with the fraction predicted by  & esin ( 1995 ) and wozniak & paczyski ( 1997 ) .",
    "future spectroscopic and astrometric studies can provide complementary information .",
    "thus , detailed answers to this first puzzle seems well within reach .",
    "the next two puzzles may , at this point in time , be compared to conan doyle s dog that did nt bark in the night .    * 2 . and 3 .",
    "where are the binary source events ?   where are the members of category @xmath23 ?",
    "* in this paper i argue that the presence of  s in the data sets implies the presence of members of category 3 .",
    "griest & hu ( 1992 ) have argued that @xmath57 of  s should exhibit significant perturbations associated with source binarity .",
    "an independent analysis yields comparable results ( han & jeong 1998 ) , even after taking into account degeneracies inherent in binary - source s ( dominik 1998 ; han & jeong 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , no perturbed binary source s are in the published literature , which is also free of members of category @xmath23 .",
    "some of the missing highly perturbed s must be in the data set , but are not yet identified as microlens candidates .   in fact",
    ", when i carried out a set of simulations like those described in  2 , but attempting to mimic the macho team s observing pattern ( frequency , including gaps , and photometric sensitivity ) and algorithmic cuts to eliminate s not deemed to be good candidates for , the large majority of strongly perturbed binary - lens s did not pass the cuts .",
    "it is also important to note that many events with physical parameters normally associated with serious perturbations are likely published among point - lens / point - source s ; the s show no obvious perturbations because of the blending of light from the source star or stars with light from other stars , possibly including the lens system , along the .",
    "blending washes out distinctive non - singular features of the perturbed s. if , for example , there is a secondary peak that rises @xmath58 above the curve associated with a point - lens fit , blending reduced the difference to @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , the second and fourth columns of figure 2 show that when blending is severe ( @xmath60 ) , then the s which are well - fit by point - lens models are primarily drawn from s that were in categories @xmath61 and @xmath23 when there was no blending ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this is because the caustic structures enhance the peak  of a significant fraction of the s in categories @xmath61 and @xmath23 , so they survive as detectable s , even when there is severe blending , although signatures of their distinctive nature may be washed out . because binary - source s do not benefit from such local increases in , they are more likely to be classified as paczyski s when blending is moderate , and more likely to be missed altogether when blending is severe .",
    "this distinction between binary - lens and binary - source s should have observable consequences .",
    "for example , if most source and lens systems are binaries , highly perturbed s discovered by additional thorough searches of the data or by the careful observations of the follow - up teams are more likely to be binary - lens s. in addition , perhaps @xmath63 of all s should display truly unusual features , due to the lensing of a binary source by a binary .",
    "* 4 . why are the event rates and the measured values of the optical depth so high ?",
    "* along the direction to the lmc the measured value of the  is @xmath64 while estimates of the component due to stars is smaller than @xmath65 ( alcock _ et al .",

    "it is tempting to ascribe the discrepancy to the presence of dark matter in the halo ( but see sahu 1994a , 1994b ; wu 1994 ) .",
    "proof that the lenses are in the lmc may be welcome , since halo models of a macho population of masses in the range indicated by the  results have proved difficult to make compatible with other observations that should be have found evidence of this population or its precursor .",
    "( see , e.g. , graff & freese 1996 ; adams & laughlin 1996 ; chabrier , segretain , & mera 1996 ; gibson & mould 1997 ; fields , mathews , & schramm 1997 . ) problems with the lmc - lens interpretation have , however , also been noted ; the most serious of these is that the virial theorem provides an independent measure the optical depth ( gould 1995 ) , and measurements of the speeds of some tracer stars indicate that velocities are too small to be consistent with a large  ( cowley & hartwick 1991 ) .",
    "it is of course possible that additional kinematic studies of lmc populations will indicate that the  of lmc lenses is indeed consistent with the present analysis of the  data .",
    "it is also worth considering whether the published  results are too high .",
    "a comparison with the bulge , where the majority of lenses are stellar systems , may be instructive . indeed ,",
