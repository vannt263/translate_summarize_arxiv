    "<S> we study the effects that ripples induce on the electrical and magnetic properties of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of the interatomic distance created by the ripples translates in a modulation of the hopping parameter between carbon atoms . </S>",
    "<S> a tight binding hamiltonian including a hubbard interaction term is solved self consistently for ripples with different amplitudes and periods . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for values of the hubbard interaction @xmath0 above a critical value @xmath1 , the system displays a superposition of local ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordered states . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless the global ferromagnetic order parameter is zero . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 depends only on the product of the period and hopping amplitude modulation . </S>",
    "<S> when the hubbard interaction is close to the critical value of the antiferromagnetic transition in pristine graphene , the antiferromagnetic order parameter becomes much larger than the ferromagnetic one , being the ground state similar to that of flat graphene . </S>"
