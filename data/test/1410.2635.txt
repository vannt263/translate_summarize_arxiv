    "this is an important observational fact since according to recent stellar evolution models for single rotating / non - rotating massive stars , hardly any wrs are expected in metal - poor environments @xcite . studying the wr content in hii galaxies is crucial to test stellar evolutionary models at low metallicities .",
    "we have initiated a program to investigate hii galaxies with wr features using integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "so far , we have observed 15 wr galaxies with the optical ifus : pmas at the 3.5 m telescope at caha and integral at the 4.2 m wht in orm .",
    "ifs has many benefits in a study of this kind , in comparison with long - slit spectroscopy . using ifs",
    "one can locate and find wrs where they were not detected before , not only because it samples a larger area of the galaxy , but also because ifs can increase the contrast of the wr bump emission against the galaxy continuum , thus minimizing the wr bump dilution .",
    "also , ifs is a powerful technique to probe issues related with aperture effects , and allows a more precise spatial correlation between massive stars and nebular properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we summarize here some recent results on mrk178 , one of _ the most metal - poor nearby wr galaxies _ ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) :    \\1 ) the origin of high - ionization nebular lines ( e.g. heii@xmath34686 ) , apparently more frequent in high - z galaxies , is still an open question .",
    "one widely favored mechanism for he@xmath4-ionization involves hot wrs , but it has been shown that nebular heii@xmath34686 is not always accompanied by wr signatures , thus wrs do not explain he@xmath4-ionization at all times @xcite . in mrk178 , we find nebular heii@xmath34686 emission spatially extended reaching well beyond the location of the wr stars ( fig .",

    "we have demonstrated that this curious behaviour is caused by aperture effects , which actually affect , to some degree , the ew(wr bump ) measurements for all galaxies in fig.1 .",
    "we have also shown that using too large an aperture , the chance of detecting wr features decreases , and that wr signatures can escape detection depending on the distance of the object and on the aperture size . therefore , wr galaxy samples / catalogues constructed on single fiber / long - slit spectrum basis may be biased",
