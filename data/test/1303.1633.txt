    "power control is an effective tool for interference management in cellular , ad - hoc , and cognitive underlay networks @xcite .",
    "the prevailing formulation of power control aims to use a minimum total transmission power to support all links in an interference network at their desired sinr targets .",
    "a longstanding issue associated with power control is that the problem often becomes _ infeasible _ , i.e. , it is not possible to simultaneously support all links in the network at their sinr targets . in this case",
    ", we must adopt a joint power and admission control approach to _ selectively _ remove some links from the network so that the remaining ones can be simultaneously supported at their desired sinr levels .",
    "our goal is to maximize the number of simultaneously supportable links at their required sinr targets while using a minimum total transmission power .",
    "theoretically , the joint power and admission control problem is known to be np - hard to solve to global optimality @xcite and to approximate to constant ratio global optimality @xcite , so various heuristic algorithms @xcite have been proposed for this problem . among them , the reference  @xcite proposed a convex approximation - based algorithm for the joint power and admission control problem . instead of directly solving the original np - hard problem , the basic idea of the proposed linear programming deflation ( lpd ) algorithm in @xcite is to approximate the problem by an appropriate convex problem .",
    "the solution to the approximation problem  can be used to check the feasibility of the original problem and guide link s removals .",
    "the removal procedure is terminated until all the remaining links in the network are simultaneously supportable .",
    "the recent work  @xcite developed another lp approximation - based new linear programming deflation ( nlpd ) algorithm for the joint power and admission control problem . in @xcite ,",
    "the joint power and admission control problem is first equivalently reformulated as a sparse @xmath0-minimization problem and then its @xmath1-convex approximation is used to derive a lp , which is different from the one in @xcite .",
    "again , the solution to the derived lp can guide an iterative link removal procedure , and the removal procedure is terminated if all the remaining links in the network are simultaneously supportable . based on the sparse @xmath0-minimization reformulation in @xcite",
    ", this paper proposes a new deflation algorithm based on @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) norm minimization for the joint power and admission control problem .",
    "compared to the @xmath1-minimization problem , the @xmath2 norm minimization problem is closer to the original @xmath0-optimization problem .",
    "the @xmath6-approximation problem is solved by applying the efficient interior - point algorithm in @xcite to solve its equivalent reformulation .",
    "numerical results show that the proposed algorithm compares favorably with the existing approaches @xcite in terms of the number of supported links , the total transmission power , and the cpu time .",
    "_ notations : _ we adopt the following notations in this paper .",
    "we denote the index set @xmath7 by @xmath8 .",

    "however , we still call it $ p$ norm for convenience in this paper.}$ ] stand for its maximum entry , its @xmath13-th entry , and its @xmath2 norm , respectively .",
    "in particular , when @xmath14 @xmath15 stands for the number of nonzero entries in @xmath16 finally , we use @xmath17 to represent the vector of an appropriate size with all components being one and @xmath18 to represent the identity matrix of an appropriate size , respectively .",
    "consider a @xmath19-link ( a link corresponds to a transmitter - receiver pair ) interference channel with channel gains @xmath20 ( from transmitter @xmath21 to receiver @xmath13 ) , noise power @xmath22 sinr target @xmath23 and power budget @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "denote the power allocation vector by @xmath26 and the power budget vector by @xmath27 . treating interference as noise ,",
    "we can write the sinr at the @xmath13-th receiver as @xmath28    the joint power and admission control problem can be mathematically formulated as a two - stage optimization problem @xcite .",
    "specifically , the first stage maximizes the number of admitted links:@xmath29 \\mbox{s.t . } & \\displaystyle { { \\mbox{sinr}}}_k\\geq \\gamma_k,~k\\in\\cal s\\subseteq\\cal k,\\\\ & \\bm{0 }",
    "\\leq { \\mathbf{p}}\\leq \\bar{\\mathbf{p}}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] we use @xmath30 to denote the optimal solution for problem and call it _ maximum admissible set_. notice that the solution for might not be unique .",
    "the second stage minimizes the total transmission power required to support the admitted links in @xmath31 : @xmath32 due to the special choice of @xmath33 power control problem is feasible and can be efficiently and distributively solved by the foschini - miljanic algorithm @xcite .",
    "since the developed algorithm in this paper follows the similar idea as the nlpd algorithm in @xcite , we first briefly review the nlpd algorithm in this section .",
    "the basic idea of the nlpd algorithm is to update the power and check whether all links can be supported or not .",
    "if the answer is yes , then terminate the algorithm ; else drop one link from the network and update the power again .",
    "the above process is repeated until all the remaining links are supported .",
    "we begin with the introduction of an equivalent normalized channel on which the nlpd algorithm is based . in particular , we use @xmath34 with @xmath35  to denote the normalized power allocation vector , and use @xmath36 with @xmath37  to denote the normalized noise vector .",
    "we denote the normalized channel matrix by @xmath38 with the @xmath39-th entry @xmath40 in fact , @xmath41 is the normalized channel gain .",
    "it is simple to check that @xmath42 if and only if @xmath43_k \\geq 0.$ ]    in @xcite , we reformulate the two - stage joint power and admission control problem and as a single - stage optimization problem @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46_k$ ] measures the excess transmission power @xcite that the transmitter of link @xmath13 needs in the normalized channel in order to be served with its desired sinr target ( assuming all other links keep their transmission powers unchanged ) .",
    "notice that the formulation is capable of finding the maximum admissible set with minimum total transmission power .",
    "since problem is still np - hard , we further consider its @xmath1-convex approximation ( equivalent to a lp ) @xmath47 by solving , we know whether all links in the network can be simultaneously supported or not . if not , we drop the link @xmath48_j+|a_{jk}|\\left[{\\mathbf{q}}_e\\right]_k\\right)\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    an easy - to - check necessary condition @xmath49 for all links in the network to be simultaneously supported is also derived in @xcite , where @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the necessary condition allows us to iteratively remove strong interfering links from the network . in particular , we remove the link @xmath53 according to the scheme @xmath54 until becomes true .",
    "the nlpd algorithm can be described as follows .",
    "in this section , we develop a new deflation algorithm based on @xmath6-minimization for the joint control problem and . as seen in section [ secreview ] , the original @xmath0-minimization problem is _ successively _ approximated by the @xmath1-minimization problem in the nlpd algorithm .",
    "intuitively , the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) norm minimization problem @xmath55 should approximate better than .",
    "this is the motivation for the development of the new deflation algorithm based on the @xmath2 norm minimization for the joint power and admission control problem .    comparing the @xmath5 norm minimization problem and the @xmath2 norm minimization problem",
    ", we see that problem is convex while problem is nonconvex ( for its objective function is nonconvex with respect to @xmath56 )",
    ". generally speaking , convex problems are relatively easy to solve , while nonconvex optimization problems are difficult to solve .",
    "however , not all nonconvex problems are hard since the lack of convexity may be due to an inappropriate formulation .",
    "in fact , many nonconvex optimization problems admit a convex reformulation . therefore , convexity is useful but unreliable to test the computational intractability of an optimization problem .",
    "a more robust tool is the computational complexity theory @xcite .",
    "we show that problem is strongly np - hard .",
    "the proof is based on a polynomial time reduction from the max-2unanimity problem , which is shown to be strongly np - hard in @xcite .    [ thm1 ] the @xmath6-minimization problem is strongly np - hard if @xmath57    the complexity result in theorem [ thm1 ] motivates us to approximately solve problem .",
    "next , we first give a reformulation of problem , and then propose to use the interior - point algorithm developed in @xcite to solve it .",
    "[ thm2 ] the @xmath6-minimization problem can be equivalently reformulated as @xmath58_k^p + \\alpha\\bar{\\mathbf{p}}^t{\\mathbf{q}}\\\\ \\mbox{s.t . } & \\displaystyle { \\mathbf{q}}_e={\\mathbf{c}}-{\\mathbf{a}}{\\mathbf{q}},\\\\&\\mathbf{0}\\leq { \\mathbf{q}}\\leq { \\mathbf{e}},~{\\mathbf{q}}_e\\geq\\mathbf{0}. \\end{array}\\ ] ]    a rigorous proof of theorem [ thm2 ] shall be given in the journal version .",
    "here we just shed some light on why it does not harm optimality to restrict @xmath59 notice that problem is equivalent to @xmath60 thus , to show the equivalence of and , it suffices to show that any optimal solution @xmath61 of always satisfies @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , assume the contrary that @xmath63 where @xmath64@xmath65_k>0\\,\\}$ ] , @xmath66@xmath65_k=0\\,\\}.$ ] then by the balancing lemma ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1 ) ) , we can appropriately reduce the power of links in @xmath67 so that both the first term and the second term in the objective of are strictly decreased .",
    "based on theorem [ thm2 ] , by introducing a slack variable @xmath68 to problem , we see that problem is actually equivalent to @xmath69_k^p + \\alpha\\bar{\\mathbf{p}}^t{\\mathbf{q}}\\\\ \\mbox{s.t . } & \\displaystyle { \\mathbf{q}}_e={\\mathbf{c}}-{\\mathbf{a}}{\\mathbf{q}},\\,{\\mathbf{s}}+{\\mathbf{q}}={\\mathbf{e}}\\\\&{\\mathbf{q}}\\geq\\mathbf{0},\\,{\\mathbf{q}}_e\\geq\\mathbf{0},\\,{\\mathbf{s}}\\geq\\mathbf{0}. \\end{array}\\]]now , we can apply the interior - point algorithm in @xcite to solve problem .",
    "similar to @xcite , we can prove that the potential reduction interior - point algorithm returns an @xmath70-kkt @xcite or @xmath70-global solution of problem in no more than @xmath71 iterations .",
    "one may ask why we wish to use interior - point algorithms to solve problem ? the reasons are the following .",
    "first , the objective function of problem is _ differentiable _ in the interior feasible region .",
    "moreover , we are actually interested in finding a sparse solution @xmath56 of problem ; if we start from a solution , some of whose entries are already zero , then it is very hard to make it nonzero .",
    "in contrast , if we start from an interior point , the interior - point algorithm may generate a sequence of interior points that bypasses solutions with the wrong zero supporting set and converges to the true one .",
    "this is exactly the idea of the interior - point algorithm developed in @xcite for the nonconvex quadratic programming .",
    "the proposed @xmath2 norm minimization deflation ( pnmd ) algorithm is given as follows .",
    "there are two unclear points in the pnmd algorithm .",
    "one is how to compute the parameter @xmath72 in problem , and the other is which removal strategy will be used in the admission control step .",
    "next , we make clear of these two points , i.e. , we shall use @xmath72 given in and the removal strategy in the new deflation algorithm .    in the nlpd algorithm @xcite ,",
    "the parameter @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 are two constants , and @xmath75 is determined by the equivalence between problem and the joint problem and , and @xmath76 is determined by the so - called `` never - over - removal '' property .",
    "since the @xmath6-minimization problem is closer to the @xmath0-minimization problem , we relax the parameter @xmath72 in to @xmath77where @xmath78 @xmath79 are three constants .    having obtained the solution @xmath80 of problem , we use the removal strategy called smart rule in @xcite to drop the link @xmath53 according to @xmath81 the above operation can be interpreted as removing the link with the largest interference plus noise footprint in the _ normalized _ network .",
    "we generate the same channel parameters as in @xcite in our numerical simulations , i.e. , each transmitter s location obeys the uniform distribution over a @xmath82 km  @xmath83  @xmath82 km square and the location of its corresponding receiver is uniformly generated in a disc with radius @xmath84 m ; channel gains are given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the euclidean distance from the link of transmitter @xmath21 to the link of receiver @xmath87 each link s sinr target is set to be @xmath88 and the noise power is set to be @xmath89 .",
    "the power budget of the link of transmitter @xmath13 is @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the minimum power needed for link @xmath13 to meet its sinr requirement in the absence of any interference from other links .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 in problem is set to be @xmath92 and the ones in are set to be @xmath93  and  @xmath94 .",
    "the number of supported links , the total transmission power , and the cpu time are the metrics we employ to compare the performance of the proposed pnmd algorithm with that of the lpd algorithm in @xcite , the algorithm ii - b in @xcite , and the nlpd algorithm in @xcite .",
    "all figures are obtained by averaging over @xmath95 monte - carlo runs .",
    "[ user1 ] , [ time1 ] , and [ power1 ] indicate that the pnmd algorithm can take less cpu time to support more links while with less total transmission power than the existing algorithms ( except the algorithm ii - b ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ power1 ] , the algorithm ii - b transmits the least power among the tested algorithms .",
    "this is because the algorithm ii - b supports the least number of links ; see fig .",
    "[ user1 ] .",
    "in particular , compared to the nlpd algorithm ] , the proposed pnmd algorithm can support ( slightly ) more links with much less total transmission power , and at the same time takes less cpu time .",
    "the performance improvement of the proposed pnmd algorithm over the nlpd algorithm is mainly attributed to the @xmath6-approximation problem .",
    "the simulation results in fig .",
    "[ user1 ] and fig .",
    "[ power1 ] show that the admissible set @xmath96 obtained by the proposed pnmd algorithm based on the @xmath6-approximation problem is `` better '' than the admissible set @xmath97 obtained by the nlpd algorithm based on the @xmath1-approximation problem , i.e. , although the cardinality of the two admissible sets @xmath96 and @xmath97 is nearly equal to each other , it takes much less total transmission power to support the links in @xmath96 than to support the links in @xmath98 this is consistent with our intuition that the @xmath99 norm minimization problem is capable of approximating the @xmath0-minimization problem better than the @xmath1-minimization problem and the fact that the maximum admissible set for the joint power and admission control problem may not be unique .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a @xmath2 @xmath100 norm minimization deflation algorithm for the joint power and admission control problem .",
