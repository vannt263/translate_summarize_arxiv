    "sagittarius a@xmath0 ( sgr a@xmath0 ) is a compact source from radio wavelength to x - ray associated with the galactic center super massive black hole ( gcbh ) , which is located just at the dynamical center of the galaxy ( @xcite ) and has the mass of @xmath2 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed size of sgr a@xmath0 is proportional to inverse square of observation frequency @xmath3}= 1.3\\lambda \\mathrm{[cm]}^2 $ ] in microwave and millimeter ranges ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relation indicates that the real picture of sgr a@xmath0 has been hidden by electron scattering around itself although submillimeter vlbi is now developing quickly to break the barrier ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently it was found by ir precision astrometry observations that a small gas cloud is approaching sgr a@xmath0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cloud , called  g2 \" , has the estimated mass of @xmath4 .",
    "it was predicted that g2 would come closer the periastron distance of @xmath5 au in the spring of 2014 ( @xmath6 ; @xcite , @xmath7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the approaching of the g2 cloud to sgr a@xmath0 is a golden opportunity to explore the vicinity of the gcbh using it as a test probe .",
    "there were some predictions of increase in emission from sgr a@xmath0 induced by the interaction of g2 with the prior existing accretion flow ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) or tidal heating of the cloud around the gcbh ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the nature of g2 is still in controversy , g2 is expected to be a gas cloud or a star with dusty envelop ( e.g. @xcite ) . nevertheless , it is understandable that g2 may give some perturbation to the accretion flow around the gcbh because g2 is seen to be somewhat extended . if any emission enhancement begins , it is very important for study of the mechanism of the event to detect the initial raising phase by ourselves and to alert world - wide community to observe the phenomenon . therefore , we made the project to monitor sgr a@xmath0 by vlbi at 22 ghz as frequently as possible .",
    "because we do nt know fundamentally when the flux density increase by the g2 cloud approaching will begin , continuous monitor is necessary to detect it .",
    "the observation frequency of 22 ghz is expected to be fairly available even in summer of japan although there is a large year - to - year variation in the weather condition .",
    "a jet eruption from sgr a@xmath0 might occur successively .",
    "it is also important to observe it continuously even after the event .    in millimeter and sub - millimeter",
    "ranges , the flux density of of sgr a@xmath0 is highly variable ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . large flares with several handred percent have been observed frequently .",
    "although the flux density at 22 ghz of sgr a@xmath0 had been monitored for 3 years with vla , there was no flare with over 100 % amplitude in the monitor ( @xcite ) .",
    "if we detect a flare significantly beyond this limit , we can conclude safely that this flare is an unusual phenomenon .",
    "we have monitored the flux density of sgr a@xmath0 at 22.2 ghz from feb .",
    "2013 to aug . 2014 with a sub - array of japanese vlbi network ( jvn ) ( @xcite ) in order to explore any change caused by the g2 cloud approaching .",
    "the sub - array consists of the mizusawa 10-m radiotelescope ( rt ) , the takahagi / hitachi 32-m rt , and the gifu 11-m rt , and the observed data were recorded by mean of the k5/vssp32 vlbi data acquisition ( daq ) system ( kondo et al .",
    "the tsukuba 32-m rt and the kashima 34-m rt have joined it when they met to the observation schedules .",
    "the daq system at each rt temporary stored vlbi data with 2 bit sampled 32 mhz bandwidth ( 128 mbps data rate ) in commercially used hard disk drives .",
    "the data was transmitted via internet , immediately after every observation finishes , to the isas where a software cross correlator which has been developed by nict ( kondo et al .",
    "2004 ) was running .",
    "we could obtain the correlation results within a half day after a daily observation performed .",
    "the details of the observation system will be shown in another publication .",
    "the angular size of sgr a@xmath0 at 22.2 ghz is expected to be @xmath8 mas by the relation mentioned above . because the sub - array has projected baselines of 150- 300 km or the beam size ( fringe spacing )",
    "is about 13 mas , we can observe the flux density of sgr a@xmath0 avoiding the flux density decrease by partially resolved - out . on the other hand ,",
    "sgr a@xmath0 is embedded in the strong extended emission surrounding itself .",
    "the high spatial resolution must be required to observe selectively the flux density of sgr a@xmath0 itself suppressing the contamination from the extended structure .",
    "therefore , the sub - array of the jvn is most suitable for the daily flux density monitor of sgr a@xmath0 .    an induced synchrotron flux with the g2 cloud approaching must be centered around the bow shock by the g2 gas cloud in the accretion flow of the gcbh ( @xcite , @xcite ) . the angular separation between sgr a@xmath0 itself and the possible bright spot is expected to be up to 25 mas around the g2 periastron passing assuming that the distance to the galactic center is 8 kpc .",
    "the two spots can be detected separately with an additional observation by the sub - array .",
    "if a new adjoining spot is detected in the flare , this proves that expected electron acceleration is occurred by the interaction between the g2 gas cloud and the accretion flow .",
    "typical system noise temperatures of rts of the sub - array were 100 - 200 k except summer season .",
    "the observing time was 10 minute for each object .",
    "three quasars , nrao530 , j1626 - 2951 , and j1924 - 2914 , were observed in a day as flux calibrators in the monitor .",
    "sgr a@xmath0 was observed twice in a day .",
    "the flux calibrators are bright quasars and located nearby sgr a@xmath0 , but certainly variable in the time scale of several months .",
    "unfortunately , all rts of the sub - array do nt have a beam switch system for measurement of the total flux density .",
    "therefore , their flux densities of the quasars were calibrated by the comparison with ngc7027 using the nobeyama 45-m telescope in order to guarantee the absolute flux density accuracy during the periastron passing . ngc7027 is a bright young planetary nebula with the flux density which is assumed to be @xmath9 jy at 22.2 ghz ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the procedure to obtain the flux density of sgr a@xmath0 is as the following .",
    "all 30-m class rts of the sub - array are closely located in the same prefecture , ibaraki prefecture .",
    "the baselines between them are not sufficient to suppress the contamination from the surrounding extended emission around sgr a@xmath0 . on the other hand , two 10-m class rts , the mizusawa 10-m rt and the gifu 11-m rt ,",
    "are geographically located 300 km in north and 300 km in west apart from the 30-m class rts , respectively . therefore , correlated amplitudes for the two baselines of the mizusawa 10-m rt a 30-m class rt and the gifu 11-m rt  a 30-m class rt were used .",
    "they are averaged to improve the sn ratio .",
    "the flux density of sgr a@xmath0 , @xmath10 , is given by , @xmath11{s_\\nu\\mathrm{(qso1)}s_\\nu\\mathrm{(qso2)}s_\\nu\\mathrm{(qso3)}}}{\\sqrt[3]{a\\mathrm{(qso1)}a\\mathrm{(qso2)}a\\mathrm{(qso3)}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the averaged correlated amplitude of a quasar .",
    "@xmath13 is the flux density which are calibrated by the method based on ngc7027 using the nobeyama 45-m telescope as mentioned above .",
    "geometric mean is useful for suppressing the effect of unexpected flux density change of the quasars .",
    "the absolute calibration uncertainty of the observation is estimated to be @xmath14% , which is fairly larger than the statistical error .",
    "1 shows the light curve of sgr a@xmath0 at 22.2 ghz in this monitor ( also see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the horizontal axis is the elapsed day ( doy ) from 1 jan , 2013 .",
    "the monitor had been performed from feb .",
    "25 , 2013 to aug . 12 , 2014 .",
    "the number of the observations in the monitor was 283 days .",
    "the error bars show only statistical errors ( @xmath15 ) of each data .",
    "first of all , we have observed no strong microwave flare of sgr a@xmath0 around the expected g2 periastron epochs which are doy=@xmath16 day ( solid line arrow in fig.1 ; gillessen et al .",
    "2013 ) and doy=@xmath17 day ( broken line arrow in fig.1 ; @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the average flux densities during the expected periastron periods are @xmath18 jy and @xmath19 jy , respectively .",
    "the errors show the standard deviation of the observed flux densities .",
    "the number in the parentheses is the number of the observations in the epoch .",
    "the observed flux densities are consistent with those of the nrao public data with jvla ( open circles in fig.1 ; @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been reported that the radio flux induced by the bow shock will be reached to the peak seven or nine months earlier than the periastron epoch because the bow shock in the accretion flow precedes the g2 cloud itself on the orbit ( @xcite ) . according to the prediction",
    ", the flux density by the bow shock should increase remarkably during doy@xmath20 day ( dot line arrow in fig.1 ) . because this epoch unfortunately corresponds to the summer rainy season in japan",
    ", there is a long intermission of the observation doy@xmath21 day .",
    "significant enhancement was not detected in the observed flux densities of sgr a@xmath0 in the epochs of doy@xmath22 day and doy@xmath23 day .",
    "in addition , there is the nrao public data at 21.2 ghz of @xmath24 jy at doy@xmath25 day .",
    "although flare with short duration can not be ruled out by these data , the expected significant enhancement with long duration did not occur .",
    "the average flux density in the whole observation period is @xmath1 jy . the observed flux densities are consistent with those of the nrao public data , @xmath26 jy . meanwhile the average flux density for the 3 years monitor with vla ( @xcite ) is @xmath27 jy . although the average and standard deviation of the measured flux densities in this monitor are practically consistent with the values for the 3 years monitor , our values are slightly larger than the values .",
    "sgr a@xmath0 in our monitor may be relatively active .",
    "however , the activity should be within the previously observed range ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have observed no unusual event of sgr a@xmath0 in the whole observation epoch .",
    "there is no significant enhancement of sgr a@xmath0 at 22.2 ghz during the periods including the expected periastron and the expected intensity peaks .",
    "the straigtforward and convicing interpretation of the negative detection is probably that g2 is a star or a tightly bounded star cluster although it may have any dusty envelope .",
    "the possibility had been discussed by several authors ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this interpretation is also consistent with the surviving image of g2 around the periastron obtained by the latest ir observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the destruction condition of the dusty envelope by tidal force of the gcbh is roughly given by , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mass of g2 and @xmath30 is the radius of the dusty envelope around g2 .",
    "if g2 is a star , it must have the mass of @xmath31 .",
    "the destruction condition is not satisfied for the inner envelope with @xmath32 1 au ; @xmath33 even around the periastron distance , @xmath34 au , although the condition for the outer envelope with @xmath35 a few au is barely satisfied ( also see @xcite ) . in this case ,",
    "g2 hardly induce the expected microwave enhancement because it has small cross section .",
    "a tightly bounded star cluster also corresponds to such case .    in the case",
    "that g2 is a gas cloud as reported initially , which is still supported by a recent ir observation ( @xcite ) , there may be several possibilities to explain it .",
    "one of them is that the magnetic field in the accretion flow is too strong to make the bow shock wave in the accretion flow .",
    "the bow shock preceding the g2 cloud plays a critical role in the acceleration of synchrotron emitting relativistic electrons ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a microwave enhancement is not caused if the bow shock is drowned out in the accretion flow . when the alfvn velocity around sgr a@xmath0 , @xmath36 , is faster than the velocity of the g2 cloud , @xmath37 , the shock wave is suppressed .",
    "@xmath36 is given by , @xmath38}= \\frac{2200h \\mathrm{[mg]}}{\\sqrt{n_{\\mathrm h}\\mathrm{[cm^{-3}]}}}.\\ ] ] because the gas density at the bondi radius of sgr a@xmath0 is estimated to be @xmath39 @xmath40 from x - ray observation ( @xcite ) , the alfvn velocity is @xmath41}\\sim 200h\\mathrm{[mg]}$ ] .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath37 is estimated by , @xmath42 then the velocity of the g2 cloud is @xmath43 km s@xmath44 around the periastron distance , which is similar to the bondi radius of sgr a@xmath0 , @xmath45 .",
    "the condition , @xmath46 , suggests the lower limit of the magnetic field around the periastron distance , @xmath47 mg .",
    "we would like to thank dr .",
    "t. kondo at the national institute of information and communications technology for providing us with a software correlator .",
    "we also thank national radio astronomy observatory for using the public data of the jvla monitor .",
