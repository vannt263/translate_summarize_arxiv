    "among the most important unsolved questions concerning the behavior of matter inside neutron stars , it is the knowledge of the thermodynamic conditions at which the deconfinement transition to quark matter would occur @xcite .",
    "the analysis of such problem is complicated by the uncertainties in the knowledge of the equation of state ( eos ) above the nuclear saturation density , as well as by the lack of a satisfactory description of both hadronic a deconfined matter within a unified description ( however see @xcite for work in this direction ) .",
    "a possible approach , is to analyze the transition within a two - phase description in which an hadronic model valid around the nuclear saturation density @xmath2 is extrapolated to larger densities and a quark model that is expected to be valid only for asymptotically large densities is extrapolated downwards . within this kind of analysis",
    "some work has been performed recently in order to determine the effect of different hadronic and quark equations of state , as well as the effect of different astrophysical environments : e.g. different temperatures , effect of color superconductivity , effect of neutrino trapping @xcite .",
    "an important characteristic of the deconfinement transition in neutron stars , is that quark and lepton flavors must be conserved during the transition @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "just deconfined quark matter is transiently out of equilibrium with respect to weak interactions ( for a short period of @xmath3 s ) . when color superconductivity is included together with flavor conservation ,",
    "the most likely configuration of the just deconfined phase is two - flavor color superconducting ( 2sc ) provided the pairing gap is large enough @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite we have investigated the role of color superconductivity in the deconfinement transition in protoneutron star ( pns ) conditions employing the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model for just deconfined quark matter . while early calculations showed that neutrino trapping may preclude the transition in pnss @xcite , the results in ref .",
    "@xcite show that color superconductivity compensates this effect resulting a transition density that is nearly constant throughout the deleptonization stage .",
    "however , a full calculation including both effects has not been done yet within the mit bag model . in the present paper",
    "we shall analyze the deconfinement transition in protoneutron star conditions employing for hadronic matter a nonlinear walecka model which includes hadrons , electrons , and electron neutrinos in equilibrium under weak interactions .",
    "for the just deconfined quark matter we shall employ the mit bag model including the effect of color superconductivity and neutrino trapping .",
    "according to numerical simulations @xcite , during the first tens of seconds of evolution the protoneutron star cools from @xmath4 mev to temperatures below @xmath5 mev .",
    "in the same period , the chemical potential of the trapped neutrinos evolves from @xmath6 mev to essentially zero .",
    "this paper extends previous calculations performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that paper",
    "we showed that the transition density for bubbles with radii around @xmath7 fm is almost coincident with the bulk transition density and that the nucleation rate of such droplets is huge .",
    "this fully justifies a more detailed treatment of several aspects of the deconfinement transition , without including surface effects at all . in view of this , we investigate here the effect of other parametrizations of the hadronic equation of state ( gm1 and nl3 ) , the effect of hyperons in the hadronic phase , we explore more parameters of the quark model , and analyze in more detail the effect of trapped neutrinos and color superconductivity .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .  2 we present the main aspects of the equations of state .",
    "in sec .  3 we study the deconfinement transition at finite temperature for different parametrizations of the equations of state and different neutrino trapping conditions .",
    "4 we discuss our results and compare them with previous calculations using the njl model in the description of quark matter .",
    "for the hadronic phase we use a non - linear walecka model @xcite for matter with and without hyperons . for matter with hyperons",
    "we include the whole baryon octet , electrons , electron neutrinos , and the corresponding antiparticles .",
    "for matter with no hyperons we consider nucleons , electrons , electron neutrinos , and the corresponding antiparticles .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath8 where the indices @xmath1 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 refer to baryons , mesons and leptons respectively . for the baryons we have @xmath11\\psi_b,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath1 extending over the nucleons @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the following hyperons @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the contribution of the mesons @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 where the coupling constants are @xmath24 electrons and neutrinos are included as a free fermi gas , @xmath25 , in chemical equilibrium with all other particles .",
    "for details on the explicit form of the equation of state derived from this lagrangian the reader is referred to ref .",
    "the equation of state can be solved numerically by specifying three thermodynamic quantities , e.g. the temperature @xmath26 , the mass - energy density @xmath22 and the chemical potential of electron neutrinos in the hadronic phase @xmath27 .",
    "the constants in the model are determined by the properties of nuclear matter and hyperon potential depths known from hypernuclear experiments @xcite . in the present work we use the gm1 parametrization given by @xcite and the nl3 parametrization given by @xcite , as shown in table  [ table1 ] . for each parametrization",
    "we construct an equation of state including nucleons plus leptons and another one including the baryon octet plus leptons .",
    "they are labeled as gm1npe@xmath28 , gm1hyp@xmath28 , nl3npe@xmath28 and nl3hyp@xmath28 .",
    "the maximum masses @xmath29 of hadronic stars are 1.78 @xmath30 for gm1npe@xmath28 , 2.32 @xmath30 for gm1hyp@xmath28 , 1.95 @xmath30 for nl3npe@xmath28 and 2.7 @xmath30 for nl3hyp@xmath28 . except for gm1npe@xmath28",
    ", these masses are compatible with the masses of the pulsars psr j1614 - 2230 with @xmath31 @xcite and psr j0348 + 0432 with @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the parametrization for the hyperon coupling constants in the case of gm1 is @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "for nl3 we use @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    ".parameters of the hadronic equation of state .",
    "the parametrizations for the hyperon coupling constants and the maximum masses of hadronic stars are given in the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the final configuration of the star after the transition depends on many issues that are out of the scope of the present paper , such as the presence or absence of mixed phases , the phase diagram of color superconducting quark matter in beta equilibrium , or the effect of rotation .",
    "in particular , we notice that the maximum allowed mass for each model is strongly affected by the distribution of the angular velocity in the radial direction and by the consequent degree of differential rotation @xcite . in view of this , having @xmath42 through the integration of a simple static tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation should not be considered as a necessary condition for consistency of our calculations with observations .",
    "anyway , we notice that some of the here used models give static stable stars when the quark phase is in the cfl state and no mixed phases are considered .",
    "for example , for @xmath1=80 mev @xmath43 and large enough @xmath44 stable cfl strange stars with @xmath42 are obtained by @xcite . for stable static hybrid stars with @xmath1 = 337 and 353 mev @xmath43 the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite and references therein .",
    "a final comment is worthwhile concerning the formation of mixed hadron - quark phases , in which the electric charge is zero globally but not locally , i.e. the two phases have opposite charges @xcite .",
    "mixed phases can not form in the here studied just - deconfined phase @xcite , because the flavor conservation condition guarantees that a just - deconfined quark - matter drop initially has exactly the same electric charge as the hadronic drop from which it originated ( i.e. zero ) .",
    "of course , charge separation could occur later on ( if energetically preferred ) and a mixed phase could form . however , notice that debye screening effects and the surface tension can prevent mixed phases to form ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in any case , this study of mixed phases concerns the state of the system at times that are much longer than the ones that are addressed in this paper .    within the mit bag model ,",
    "the expected effects on protoneutron star evolution are as follows . when a pns is formed it is hot and it has a large amount of trapped neutrinos .",
    "if color superconductivity were not considered , cooling will increase the transition density while deleptonization will decrease it @xcite .",
    "since both effects compete which each other it is possible that the transition is inhibited in the initial moments of the evolution of neutron stars @xcite . as shown in the present paper , when color superconductivity is taken into account , the decrease of temperature decreases the transition density ( due to the increase of the pairing gap ) .",
    "therefore , both cooling and deleptonization of the pns increase the probability of deconfinement as the pns evolves .",
