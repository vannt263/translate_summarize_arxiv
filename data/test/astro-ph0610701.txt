    "the space density of white dwarfs is not well known even in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "there is also a deficit of bright white dwarfs in the galactic plane , compared to high galactic latitudes , due to the fact that most white dwarfs have been discovered out of the plane as by - products of extragalactic surveys .",
    "the best way to obtain a complete sample of white dwarfs , and thus compute accurate space densities , is to search for them in the galactic plane , where most of them reside .",
    "the use of a multi - band galactic plane survey will greatly facilitate this task .",
    "egaps is the combination of a number of galactic plane surveys in several passbands .",
    "the main aim of egaps is to obtain broad band ( u , g , r , i , z , y , j , h , ks ) and narrow band ( h@xmath0 and hei ) photometry of a 10 degree latitude strip centred in the plane all along the galaxy , i.e. covering the northern and southern galactic planes , and going down to 21st magnitude in the optical bands . most of the stars in the galaxy lie in the plane thus by surveying a 10 degree - wide strip we are gathering photometry for 1 billion stars , one per cent of the total number of stars in the milky way .",
    "these large numbers are required to study statistically the different stellar populations .",
    "the surveys that make up egaps ( on - going , approved and proposed ) are shown , together with their coverage , filters and limiting magnitudes , in table 1 .",
    "iphas , uvex and vphas+ are all double pass surveys and include re - observations at intervals of at least two years to determine proper motions of all targets .",
    "@xmath1white overlaps in area with vphas+ and includes observations in the hei narrow - band filter and 25 observations of selected fields in a two - hour interval .",
    "this will allow the detection and study of hei emission sources such as am  cvn systems and of short period variables such as am cvns , magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , post - bounce cvs and other ultracompact binaries and fast pulsators .",

    "iphas will most probably be complete by the end of 2007 .",
    "the completion date for uvex is still uncertain .",
    "both vst programs ( vphas+ and @xmath1white ) will probably start at the end of 2007/beginning of 2008 and will be complete by 2010 .",
    "the vvv survey has yet to be approved .",
    "up to date information on egaps and its constituent surveys will be posted during and after the data taking at : http://www.egaps.org",
    "white dwarfs are a galactic population and yet have mostly been found at high latitudes . as mentioned above ,",
    "the two main reasons for this are : 1 .",
    "they have been found as interlopers in the search for blue extragalactic sources , 2 .",
    "the plane presents a challenge to observe due to the vast number of sources and the high extinction . as most of the white dwarfs in the galaxy will be in the plane , it is definitely worth looking for them there . from simulations of the distribution of objects with galactic latitude , using a galactic model based on @xcite and including",
    "extinction towards the galactic plane according to the sandage model , nelemans ( private communication ) finds that 12 ( 40 ) per cent of old ( young ) white dwarfs , i.e. with mv = 15 ( 10 ) , are concentrated within @xmath4 .",
    "reddening turns out not to be such a tough problem to go around as it is only severe within the first two degrees in latitude .",
    "synthetic spectra for 6 hydrogen - rich white dwarfs with temperatures of 10,000 , 20,000 , 30,000 , 40,000 , 50,000 and 60,000 k are shown in fig .  1 together with the passbands of broad band filters used in egaps and the passband of the h@xmath0 narrow band filter .",
    "the h@xmath0 narrow band filter allows us to search for both h@xmath0 emission and absorption stars , this last group includes white dwarfs .",
    "the h@xmath0 equivalent width of hydrogen - rich white dwarfs scales with temperature , being larger for temperatures between 10,000 and 20,000 k ( see fig .",
    "2 ) which means that the iphas survey on its own is most sensitive to white dwarfs in that temperature range .",
    "this temperature range is particularly interesting as it overlaps with the hydrogen - rich white dwarf instability strip , 11,00012,500 k @xcite .",
    "3 shows an example of the iphas colour space for a given field in cassiopeia .",
    "the position where the un - reddened hydrogen - rich white dwarfs lie is marked with a box .",
    "the position of this box was calculated by convolving the iphas band passes with a set of sdss hydrogen - rich white dwarfs . for this given field ,",
    "we find one white dwarf candidate .",
    "the rest of the stars in the field outline the main sequence , as well as the giant and supergiant sequences ( see @xcite 2005 , for a description of the positions of the un - reddened and reddened main sequence , the giant and the supergiant sequences in the iphas colour space ) .",
    "white dwarfs in the iphas colour space lie away from the main sequence and therefore are easy to pick out .",
    "we performed a search for white dwarfs by looking for candidates in the colour box presented in the previous section in the first iphas data release , which comprises 10 observing epochs between august 2003 and 2004 .",
    "as iphas is a double pass survey , all fields are observed twice with only a small region of non - overlap between the two fields .",
    "we only selected candidates that appeared in both fields and whose positions differed , from one field to its overlap , by one arcsec at the most .",
    "the densities of white dwarfs found vary considerably from epoch to epoch and are given in table 2 .",
    "these discrepancies can not be explained only by the different area in the sky that each epoch covers , or by contamination of the white dwarf box due to different reddening in different fields .",
    "the result of reddening would be to move white dwarfs to larger values of ( r @xmath5 i ) and ( r @xmath5 h@xmath0 ) out of the box , thus the white dwarf density would decrease .",
    "no other objects would fall in the white dwarf box to increase the number of false detections so this can not explain the large value seen , for example in jun 2004 .",
    "the most probable causes for the discrepancies are : the fact that not all the data is of the same quality and only a seeing cutoff has been applied in this search , and that there is not , as yet , a global photometric solution for the survey , which translates in offsets between colours for different fields .",
