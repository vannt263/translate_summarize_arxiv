    "weather derivatives are contingent contracts whose payments are determined by the difference between some underlying weather measurement and a pre - specified strike value . they provide a useful risk management tool for any party facing weather risk .",
    "they also provide investments which are often uncorrelated with more traditional financial instruments , allowing investors to diversify .",
    "the first weather derivative was developed in 1996 , and by 1999 derivatives and their options were being traded on the chicago mercantile exchange @xcite .",
    "@xcite give a list of 5 elements common to all weather derivatives .",
    "these include ( a ) an underlying weather index , ( b ) a well - defined time period , ( c ) the weather station used for reporting , ( d ) the payment attached to the index value , and ( e ) the strike value which first triggers payment .",
    "the intention is for the buyer of the derivative to be compensated by the seller for amounts which roughly correspond to actual business losses .",
    "ideally , these losses are perfectly correlated with the payments of the weather derivative , though in practice this is rarely achieved .",
    "tailoring the contract to the specific needs of one buyer reduces its general appeal in a secondary market , and thus lowers the value of the contract .",
    "weather derivatives offer benefits to the buyer and seller not found in traditional insurance .",
    "the buyer does not need to have an insurable interest , nor do they need to demonstrate an actual loss to receive payment .",
    "the loss payment itself is generally proportional to the difference between the weather index and strike value .",
    "furthermore , weather derivatives offer the buyer the opportunity to sell ( or even buy back ) the contract in a secondary market such as the chicago mercantile exchange , or over the counter .",
    "there are no such markets for traditional insurance products .",
    "derivatives are also in general more lightly regulated , and payments are often considered taxable .    from the seller s point of view , weather derivatives offer several advantages over traditional insurance .",
    "weather derivatives avoid the higher administrative and loss adjustment expenses of insurance contracts .",
    "they also eliminate concern for moral hazard , morale hazard , and fraud , as the event triggering the payment is easily verified and completely beyond the buyer s control . when used to insure crops , weather derivatives help reduce the perceived information asymmetry associated with crop insurance , wherein farmers often have more information about their individual risk than insurers @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the use of weather derivatives to provide protection against high impact , low probability business losses caused by extremes in the weather . though not technically insurance , we model losses and price derivatives using actuarial techniques originally developed to price insurance .",
    "the weather derivatives we consider define some payment @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the unknown weather random variable , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the pre - specified strike and limit values ( occasionally we only write @xmath4 or @xmath5 to refer to the loss to simplify notation ) .",
    "examples of three types of derivatives with payments based on high exceedances include    1 .",
    "@xmath6 if @xmath7 and 0 otherwise 2 .",
    "@xmath8 if @xmath7 and 0 otherwise 3 .",
    "@xmath8 when @xmath9 and @xmath10 when @xmath11 , and 0 otherwise ,    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are dollar values , and @xmath14 is the realization of random variable @xmath1 .",
    "the first provides a flat payment whenever the event @xmath7 occurs , the second provides a proportional payment based on the difference @xmath15 , while the third limits the total payment . unlike most derivatives , weather derivatives do not have an underlying tradable asset , and thus many pricing approaches based on financial theory are inappropriate . @xcite",
    "provide an excellent reference and discussion of pricing techniques for weather derivatives .",
    "the pricing approach we take is based on computing expected losses and expected loss variability .",
    "the first step is to compute the expected payout @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the density function of weather variable @xmath1 .",
    "for the three derivatives , shown , expected payments are    1 .",
    "@xmath18 2 .",
    "@xmath19 3 .",
    "@xmath20 .    when viewed from the point of view of insurance , the quantities @xmath21 are the _ pure premiums _ of the contracts . in the absence of any expenses , profit , risk loadings and time - value financial considerations , this is the price of the contract for the buyer .",
    "such contracts are fairly straightforward to price once one has an accurate estimate of the density function @xmath17 in the region where @xmath22 .",
    "further , one can compute all second moments as    1 .",
    "@xmath23 2 .",
    "@xmath24 3 .",
    "@xmath25 ,    and from these compute the variance @xmath26 .",
    "this information is often incorporated into the premium by adding a risk load @xmath27 , which is added to the pure premium as @xmath28 .",
    "risk loads are meant to account for the additional risk taken on by writing derivatives with larger variability of losses .",
    "commonly , risk loads are a function of the variance ( or standard deviation ) of loss @xcite .",
    "@xcite describes several common risk loadings such as @xmath29 , or @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a dollar amount chosen to satisfy some risk tolerance criteria .",
    "next , consider a portfolio of @xmath32 weather derivatives , with aggregate payment @xmath33 .",
    "the expected aggregate payment is simply the sum of the individual expected payments , @xmath34 however , when we allow for possible dependence among contracts , the variance of the aggregate payment is @xmath35 the first issue when pricing weather derivatives ( extreme or otherwise ) is to properly address the positive correlation among contracts , with its resulting impact on aggregate loss variability as shown in equation  [ eq : rho ] .",
    "it is easy to envision positively correlated payments in a portfolio of weather derivatives , since weather variables are often positively correlated in space .",
    "this correlation implies the variance of the aggregate payment exceeds the sum of individual payment variances , and thus risk loadings priced individually would be insufficient for the portfolio as a whole .",
    "next , consider the challenges when focusing on extreme weather events .",
    "examples of such events may include the maximum daily temperature exceeding some high threshold , the minimum daily temperature falling below some low threshold , or the minimum monthly rainfall falling below some low threshold .",
    "these events can often be written as @xmath36 or @xmath37 where @xmath38 is some weather - related random variable and @xmath2 is a pre - specified strike value . in all cases",
    "we are defining a contract not based on  typical \" weather patterns of temperature or precipitation , but on extremes . what is needed to accurately price these contracts",
    "is the distribution function of extreme events .",
    "furthermore , when one considers a collection of @xmath32 derivatives defined at different locations , one must carefully consider if the dependence of extremes is different from the dependence exhibited by non - extreme events .",
    "putting the two issues together , what is needed to price weather derivatives for extreme events is a model that ( 1 ) directly targets extremes , and ( 2 ) properly incorporates the spatial correlation of weather extremes .",
    "one could further extend this to models which incorporate time dependence of extremes as well .",
    "however , in this paper we focus on the spatial dependence of weather derivatives for extremes , as that is the largest omission of current methodology .",
    "we begin with the problem of pricing a single weather derivative in the first section .",
    "this is handled through the generalized extreme value distribution @xcite , which is the only permissible limit of the maxima of independent , identically distributed univariate random variables .",
    "we demonstrate the approach by pricing a weather derivative based on extreme summer temperatures in phoenix , arizona . in the third section ,",
    "we introduce models used in spatial statistics and spatial extremes , which will serve as a foundation for the fourth and fifth sections . there , we extend our weather derivative pricing model to multiple locations through the use of max - stable processes .",
    "these processes capture dependence in spatial extremes . through large numbers of simulations , we can estimate all marginal variances , covariances , and other quantities of interest when pricing a portfolio of weather derivatives . this information is ultimately incorporated into risk loads added to the pure premiums . from the method presented , pure premiums and risk loads for a collection of @xmath32 spatially dependent weather derivatives can be obtained .",
    "an application is shown in section 6 .",
    "we begin by introducing the model used for modeling maxima ( minima can always be rewritten as @xmath39 , so there is no loss in generality when one considers only maxima ) .",
    "let @xmath40 be independent and identically distributed univariate random variables with some distribution function @xmath41 , and let @xmath42 be the maximum .",
    "if @xmath43 converges to a non - degenerate distribution under re - normalization as @xmath44 for some sequences @xmath45 and @xmath46 , then @xmath47 must be a member of the generalized extreme value ( gev ) family , with distribution function @xmath48 here @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the location , scale , and shape parameters , respectively @xcite .",
    "the sign of the shape parameter @xmath51 corresponds to the three classical extreme value distributions : @xmath52 is frchet , @xmath53 is weibull , and @xmath54 ( in the limit ) is gumbel .",
    "the frchet case corresponds to a heavy tailed distribution , gumbel is intermediate , and weibull has a bounded upper limit .    in practice , it is nt necessary to worry about specifying sequences @xmath46 and @xmath45 due to the property of _ max - stability _ : if @xmath40 are independent and identically distributed from @xmath47 , then @xmath55 also has the same distribution with only a change in location and scale , as @xmath56 for constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 . a distribution is a member of the generalized extreme value family if and only if it is max - stable @xcite .",
    "a practical consequence of this property is that if one changes the block size ( from monthly maxima to annual maxima , for instance ) and fits a new model , new estimates for the three gev parameters ( @xmath59 are obtained , but the model is still gev .",
    "a special case of the generalized extreme value family is the unit - frchet , with distribution function @xmath60 .",
    "any member of the generalized extreme value family may be transformed to have unit - frchet margins as follows : if @xmath38 has a generalized extreme value distribution with range @xmath61 , then a new variable @xmath62 may be defined as @xmath63 and @xmath62 has unit - frchet margins .",
    "if the parameters are unknown , they may first be estimated and then the transformation to @xmath62 is taken . when we model multivariate or spatial extremes , there is no loss in generality when one assumes the margins are all unit - frchet . in practice , one would first estimate all marginal distributions and transform to unit - frchet , then in a second step analyze the spatial dependence",
    ".    the gev model can be fit to observed data using maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "call the parameter vector @xmath64 .",
    "this parameter can be as simple as three fixed parameters , as @xmath65 .",
    "alternatively , one can model the gev parameters using temporal or spatial covariates .",
    "a few examples include @xmath66 , where @xmath3 is time , or @xmath67 , which considers effects of latitude , longitude , and elevation on the scale parameter .",
    "no matter the structure of the parameter @xmath64 , define the density function @xmath68 .",
    "then , the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath64 is @xmath69 this maximization is often done numerically , and has been implemented in a number of software programs including ` r ` @xcite using the function ` fgev ` in the package ` evd ` .",
    "the density function for the fitted model is obtained by plugging in the maximum likelihood estimate as @xmath70      once we have a fitted model , we can use this to estimate the necessary pure premium and risk loading .",
    "this requires estimates of the first two moments of the unknown payment variable @xmath4 , as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the loss payment for realization @xmath73 raised to the @xmath74 power ( @xmath75 or @xmath76 ) , and @xmath17 is the density function of the maxima .",
    "the first type of weather derivative discussed has @xmath77 for @xmath22 , which means the integral can be evaluated exactly as @xmath78    the second and third types of derivatives involve more complicated integrals , so we use monte carlo techniques to estimate them .",
    "this approach can be used to estimate moments for other types of derivatives with even more complicated payment structures , and is thus the most general approach .",
    "here we draw a large iid sample @xmath79 for @xmath80 , and for each draw we compute the payment @xmath81 . assuming that @xmath82 is finite , then by the strong law of large numbers as @xmath83 , sample means converge to the first and second moments as @xcite @xmath84 and @xmath85 furthermore ,",
    "if the fourth moment is finite , as @xmath86 , then by the central limit theorem we know that the sample average in equation  [ eq : sa ] is asymptotically normal with variance @xmath87 , and the sample average in equation  [ eq : sa2 ] is asymptotically normal with variance @xmath88 .",
    "we estimate the expected payments under the second and third contracts by drawing @xmath89 , and compute @xmath81 and @xmath90 for each of draw using @xmath91 total draws .",
    "this total number was chosen to provide highly accurate estimates within a reasonable time , and simulations showed it was sufficiently high to eliminate concern for purely numerical monte carlo error .",
    "sample averages of each converge to the theoretical first and second moments , which are used in the pricing model .",
    "one example of a risk - loaded premium based on marginal variance is @xmath92 \\label{eqtwo}\\ ] ] for some dollar amount @xmath31 , chosen to satisfy some risk tolerance criteria .",
    "as an example of how this model may be used , consider pricing a weather derivative with payments whenever the maximum daily summer temperature in the city of phoenix , az exceeds some high threshold @xmath2 .",
    "on june 26 , 1990 , phoenix airport was forced to close because the temperature exceeded 122 degrees fahrenheit .",
    "aircraft operating manuals did not provide information for takeoff and landing procedures in temperatures above 120 degrees fahrenheit .",
    "the closure caused the predictable sort of economic disruption which accompanies airport closures .",
    "we envision a weather derivative as a useful tool in this situation .    to price the derivative , we collect maximum daily summer temperatures at the phoenix airport , @xmath93 for year @xmath94 and day @xmath95 , where @xmath96 ( the 92 days in june , july , and august ) for years 1933 to 2010 .",
    "this data comes from the national climate data center . for each year @xmath94",
    ", we take the block maximum @xmath97 , and model these annual maxima @xmath98 as a generalized extreme value distribution . plotting these data ,",
    "we observe evidence of a slight positive trend over time ( figure  [ fig : phoenixtemp ] ) . a simple linear model of maximum temperature versus year shows a statistically significant positive slope of 0.03363 , with p - value 0.007 .",
    "we also find no evidence that annual maximum temperatures are autocorrelated .",
    "we estimate the gev parameter @xmath64 using maximum likelihood estimation , as shown in equation  [ eq : hatphi ] , but with the possibility of a trend on the location parameter , as @xmath66 where @xmath3 is year .",
    "thus , the gev parameter here is actually @xmath99 .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimates ( with standard errors shown in brackets ) are @xmath100 $ ] , @xmath101 $ ] , @xmath102 $ ] , and @xmath103 $ ] . figure  [ fig : phoenix ] shows some common diagnostics and the return level plot .",
    "the return level plot shows the expected number of years before an exceedance of a certain level is reached .",
    "this is the same as the reciprocal of the probability of a specified exceedance , and forms the basis for statements such as describing an event as aonce every 50 years \" event .    with the fitted model for maximum summer temperature",
    ", we can estimate the first and second moments of various weather derivative payments in the year 2011 .",
    "estimated moments for the three types of derivatives from section 1 are shown in tables  [ table1 ] ,  [ table2 ] ,  [ table3 ] , and  [ table4 ] . as the limit @xmath104 , payments under the second and third types are equal .",
    ".phoenix , az example : model first and second moments for the type 1 weather derivative with flat payment",
    "@xmath105 paid whenever the maximum daily temperature @xmath106 in the year 2011 , using equation  [ eqone ] . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from equation  [ eq : rhat ] and the information in the table , we compute the risk load for contract @xmath107 as @xmath108 this is roughly half of the total increase of @xmath109 .",
    "the remainder would be apportioned to the risk loads of first three derivatives as they renew .",
    "when we included the 7 time - varying location parameters , we computed a risk load of @xmath110 , a reduction of only 2.3% .",
    "this alleviates concerns that we might have wrongly ignoring trends in the gev location parameter @xmath111 .",
    "if the inclusion of trends on the gev location parameters @xmath112 had resulted in a substantially larger risk estimate , it might warrant the inclusion of trends as the more conservative choice .",
    "however , the limited statistical evidence of trends combined with such a small reduction in the risk estimate supports dropping them altogether .",
    "we have described a means of pricing a collection of extreme weather derivatives based on simulations from max - stable processes . naturally , there will be some error between the collection of simulated payments and actual payments .",
    "we discuss the errors introduced from model selection , simulations , and parameter estimation .",
    "we have taken the approach to modeling spatial extremes as max - stable processes with generalized extreme value margins , and naturally this model may not be appropriate for some spatial extremes data . for weather derivatives with payments based on maxima ( or minima ) of some weather variable , models based on block maxima ( or minima ) of the data",
    "make the most sense , and certainly the gev distribution has appealing asymptotic properties for these data .",
    "@xcite discusses diagnostics to check the validity of the gev for the marginal data .",
    "max - stable processes very naturally extend the gev to the spatial domain , and are thus the logical choice for spatial block maxima data . while a goal is to extend the approach presented in this manuscript to include non - stationary fields , at present this approach can only handle stationary fields . within the class of stationary max - stable processes ,",
    "there are some choices of models .",
    "one can model the gev parameters @xmath113 , and @xmath51 with spatial , temporal , or other covariates , and one can consider different correlation functions @xmath114 for the spatial dependence of the max - stable process . in this paper",
    "we did not show much detail on model selection , however the paper by @xcite shows the use of composite likelihood information criteria to handle model selection questions like these .",
    "the computational cost of simulations from a max - stable process is minimal , and thus one can simulate hundreds of thousands or millions of events with relative ease .",
    "errors arising from numerical approximation in estimating the moments of payments assuming some fitted model using equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) are thus likely to be quite small , and can be made arbitrarily smaller with greater numbers of simulated events .",
    "the largest source of error in this approach is likely to come from parameter risk - that is , the error in estimating the gev and max - stable process parameters @xmath64 and @xmath115 . reducing parameter risk is best handled through fitting the process to more weather data : more years of data , more locations of data , or ideally both .",
    "a point worth stressing is that the data used to fit the max - stable process can ( and probably should ) contain far more locations than the portfolio of weather derivatives . by adding additional points of data to fit the process",
    ", one reduces the parameter risk associated with estimating @xmath115 , the spatial dependence parameter .",
    "our analysis is really a two - step procedure : the first transforms gev margins to unit - frchet by obtaining parameter estimate @xmath116 , and then in a second step we fit a max - stable process to the transformed data to obtain dependence parameter estimates @xmath117",
    ". we should point out that a single step procedure is possible , and is implemented in the package ` spatialextremes ` , but this has two drawbacks .",
    "the first is that the numeric optimization of the likelihood needs to maximize a high dimension parameter . in our example on midwestern temperature data ,",
    "the dimension would be @xmath118 ( and even larger if we kept time - varying gev location parameters ) .",
    "the dimension raises concerns that the numeric optimizer may converge to a local maxima , not the global one .",
    "a second drawback is that single - step maximization of a max - stable process can be a painfully slow process , requiring orders of magnitude more time than a two - step procedure . with these drawbacks in mind , the two - step procedure was selected .",
    "one final comment is the potential mismatch between past and future weather extremes , particularly in the context of climate change .",
    "one can model the location @xmath111 and scale @xmath119 parameters of the gev with time covariates to allow for the possibility of non - stationary maxima in time .",
    "it is much less common to model the shape parameter @xmath51 as anything other than a fixed number .",
    "we have illustrated the use of time covariates for modeling the location parameter as @xmath120 in the phoenix airport temperature example .",
    "we caution readers not to extrapolate models such as these too far into the future ."
