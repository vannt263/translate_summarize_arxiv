    "the formation of cosmological defects was reexamined and the conclusion was different from @xcite and @xcite . as was noted in ref.@xcite , the effect of compactification is significant for the defect formation , if it is induced by tachyon condensation after brane inflation . since the compactification radius must be small compared to the horizon size during inflation , any variation of a field in the compactified direction is suppressed .",
    "then the daughter brane , which is the defect formed by tachyon condensation on the worldvolume of the mother brane , wraps the same compactified space as the mother brane . as a result , the codimension of the daughter brane should lie within the uncompactified space . since the number of the codimension must be",
    "even , the cosmological defect is inevitably a cosmic string . in ref.@xcite",

    "their conclusion was that the creation of the gradients of the rr fields in the bulk of the compactified space is costly in energy , so that the creation of the daughter d brane is suppressed if they do not fill all the compactified dimensions .    here",
    "it should be noted that the above arguments are not fully reliable .",
    "the most obvious example is the inconsistency of the tension of strings produced after angled brane inflation . in the original argument in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the @xmath4-dependence of the tension of the string did not coincide with the one calculated from the effective lagrangian .",
    "what is wrong with the above arguments ?",
    "the reason is clearly described in ref.@xcite . in the original argument of ref.@xcite , it was discussed that the daughter branes are created on the mother brane .",
    "in fact the statement is true , but we should be more careful about the process of the brane recombination .",
    "when the distance between the mother branes becomes shorter than a critical distance , tachyon starts to condensate on a mother brane .",
    "therefore the tachyon forms strings on the mother brane when the mother branes start to recombine .",

    ", the daughter @xmath5 brane does not wrap the same compactified space as the mother brane .",
    "the tension of the cosmic string is calculated in ref.@xcite , which depends on @xmath4 and matches to the effective action .",
    "therefore , the daughter brane in fig.[fig : split ] satisfies the property required from analysis of the effective lagrangian .",
    "thus for the angled inflation model , it is obvious that the cosmic string does not wrap the same compactified space as the mother brane . from the above discussions , it is appearent that the original argument of ref.@xcite fails because there is no obvious reason that in their final state the daughter branes wrap the same compactified space as the mother brane . the idea , which supports the formation of daughter branes that are extended between mother branes , is quite important for our discussions in this paper .",
    "since the previous arguments can not fully account for the generic processes of cosmological defect formation , one can hardly accept their conclusions without reconsiding the production of monopoles and domain walls paying careful attention to the brane dynamics .",
    "is it really impossible to produce sufficient amount of cosmological monopoles and domain walls by the branes ? as we have discussed in ref.@xcite , crucial modifications are required for the previous arguments , since it is possible to produce daughter branes that do not wrap the same compactified space as the mother brane . in this paper",
    "we will reconsider the formation of cosmological monopoles and domain walls by using the new idea .",
    "for the extended branes to be produced between mother branes , the distance between mother branes are required to vanish at a moment .",

    "two examples are already discussed in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite , where the formation of cosmic strings are considered . *",
    "two branes coincide during inflation .",
    "+ in the effective action , the brane distance plays the role of a trigger field of hybrid inflation .",
    "this type of brane inflation is already discussed in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite , in which the formation of unstable semilocal strings are suggested . in this paper , using the model in ref.@xcite , we will show that a point - like object that corresponds to a monopole in the effective action can be produced as a daughter @xmath7 brane .",
    "the daughter @xmath7 brane is extended between @xmath8 branes .",
    "we calculate the tension of the extended object and show that it coincides with the mass of a monopole in the effective action . * branes collide or oscillate with huge kinetic energy .",
    "+ after brane collision , there would be chaotic processes , which include oscillation , recombination and production / annihilation of branes .",
    "therefore , it seems natural to expect that there could be a stage of preheating after inflation , which induce large occupation numbers for long - wavelength configurations that is necessary for the domain wall production from sphalerons .",
    "then , extended objects could be formed efficiently between oscillating branes . as usual , these non - equilibrium processes are always important for the discussions about cosmological defect formation . as in the case of the conventional electroweak phase transition",
    ", we do not exclude the possibility that the final state of the oscillating branes are separated at a distance , which implies a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the effective lagrangian .",
    "the defect branes could be created by the tachyon condensation on the mother brane , or could have been existed from the beginning and have been dissolved in the mother brane . in section 2 , we consider the model of brane inflation in ref.@xcite and study the cosmological formation of monopoles after brane inflation . in section 3 , we discuss the formation of cosmological domain walls .",
    "as expected , there are notable differences between the previous arguments and our conclusions .",
    "the cosmological formation of monopoles and domain walls are not always negligible in models of brane cosmology .",
    "our results are consistent with the analyses of the effective action .",
    "in this section , we discuss the formation of monopoles in a specific example of brane inflation .",
    "we first repeat the previous arguments in ref.@xcite , which suggest that monopoles are not produced by the usual daughter brane creation after inflation . as is noted in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the effect of compactification is significant for the daughter brane creation . since the compactification radius is small compared to the horizon size during inflation , any variation of a field in the compactified direction",
    "is suppressed . as a result , the daughter brane wraps the same compactified dimensions as the mother brane .",
    "the codimension of the daughter branes should lie within the uncompactified space , which suggests that the defect is inevitably a cosmic string . seeing the above arguments",
    ", one might conclude that the monopoles are not produced after brane inflation .",
    "is the production of monopoles really impossible ? to answer this question , we consider a simple example where monopoles are produced by the daughter brane creation after brane inflation . to avoid the ambiguity of the brane products , we consider a model in which the daughter brane formation is described without such ambiguity .",
    "the schematic representation of our idea is given in fig.[fig : monopole ] .",
    "the typical configuration of fig.[fig : monopole ] will also appear in generic cosmological processes where branes collide , recombine or stick together by thermal effects .    in any case , if the production of monopoles or domain walls is suggested in the analysis of the effective action , it is natural to think that it should be possible to explain how they can be formed by the cosmological brane dynamics .",
    "moreover , even if the production of such defects is not suggested in the effective action , they might be produced by the pure brane dynamics beyond the cut - off scale of the effective action .",
    "first we make a brief review of the halyo s idea for brane inflation on conifolds@xcite .",
    "the important aspect of this scenario is that the location of the inflating branes coincide at the end of inflation , then the branes separate along the @xmath9 compactified space .",
    "the model is described as a d - brane inflation on fractional @xmath7 branes transverse to a resolved and deformed conifold .",
    "the d - term inflation is induced by the conifold that is resolved by the blow - up of its tip . in the effective action",
    ", the model looks like a model of hybrid d - term inflation .",
    "the slow roll is described by the slow motion of the two fractional @xmath7 branes approaching each other along a compactified direction , and the trigger field parameterizes the distance between the two branes along the other compactified space in the base of the conifold .",
    "for example , one can consider a conifold that is described as a cone over @xmath10 , where a @xmath7 brane , which is transverse to the conifold , is separated into two fractional d3 branes on the @xmath11 .",
    "the conifofd singularity is resolved by replacing the tip of the cone with an @xmath9 of finite size , which induces inflation .",
    "the inflaton mass arises from another deformation of the conifold towards @xmath12 and results in a slow motion of the two fractional branes towards each other .",
    "as we are not interested in the parameter space of inflation itself , we spare the discussions about the condition for successful inflation . for us ,",
    "the important point is to understand the formation of daughter branes after inflation , which finally become extended between the separating mother branes . as was already discussed in ref.@xcite , one usually expect that the cosmic strings , which has codimension 2 in the uncompactified space , are formed after inflation .",
    "if the inflating @xmath7 brane is a @xmath8 brane wrapped on the @xmath13 with radius @xmath14 , the tension of the @xmath7 brane is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the @xmath13 metric and ns - ns field on the @xmath13 respectively .",
    "taking @xmath18 for simplicity , one can find @xmath19 the tension of the inflating @xmath7 brane must be equal to the energy density during inflation , which corresponds to the anomalous d - term in the effective lagrangian . thus in this case",
    ", the relation @xmath20 is required , where @xmath21 is the gauge coupling in the effective action .",
    "the cosmic strings are produced by tachyon condensation , which are the daughter @xmath7 branes on the worldvolume of the inflation brane .",
    "the daughter brane wraps around the same compactified space as the mother brane . in this case",
    ", however , the symmetry of the corresponding field in the effective action allows only semilocal strings , which is unstable to dissolve in space , as is expected from the brane dynamics .",
    "let us consider a configuration of fig.[fig : monopole ] . if the seed of the daughter brane fluctuate between the two coincidental mother branes , it will be pulled out of the mother branes .",
    "the branes that are extended between mother branes are point - like objects in the effective action on the mother brane .",
    "it is easy to calculate the tension of such daughter branes and compare it with the mass of the monopoles in the effective action .",
    "string ending on a @xmath7 brane provides a magnetic source for the three - brane worldvolume gauge field .",
    "our example is a simple modification of the scenario .",
    "however , it was still unclear if such extended branes are produced after brane inflation .",
    "as we have repeated above , the previous arguments were negative to the cosmological production of such monopoles . ] in the final state of brane inflation , two branes are separated at a distance of @xmath22 .",
    "the effective mass of the extended daughter brane is @xmath23 where the gauge coupling is given by the formula @xmath24 it is easy to see that the mass of the extended daughter brane coincides with the mass of the monopole in the effective action@xcite .",
    "we can extend the above analysis to the cases where more than two branes are oscillating around each other ( or stick together by the thermal effects ) and then fall apart along a direction of the compactified space . in this case , one can construct @xmath25 monopoles , which are the daughter branes extended between @xmath26 mother branes .",
    "a schematic representation is given in fig.[fig : monopole_n ] .",
    "seeing the above arguments , we can not help thinking about the m theory fivebrane version of qcd ( mqcd ) , where the quantum effects are explained by the brane dynamics . in the most basic model of mqcd , which is depicted in fig.[fig : mqcdmonopole ] , a monopole in type iia string theory@xcite is a rectangular @xmath27 brane with two boundaries on @xmath28 branes and other two on ns brane .",
    "the mass of such monopole is proportional to the minimal area of the hole between the branes . in realistic models ,",
    "such brane configuration is expected to be embedded in the compactified space .",
    "is the cosmological formation of the @xmath27 monopoles impossible ? in this case , the following conditions are required for the production of the @xmath27 brane monopoles .",
    "* there was a period when the two @xmath28 branes coincide .",
    "* @xmath27 brane is created on the worldvolume of the @xmath28 brane .",
    "when the area shrinks to zero , the monopole becomes the massless excitation .",
    "the @xmath27 brane is produced on the worldvolume of the @xmath28 branes , due to the usual mechanism of tachyon condensation . in fig.[fig : monopoled2 ] , we show why the @xmath27 brane can be extended between the separating @xmath28 branes . as usual , the daughter brane does not fluctuate in any direction of the compactified space , while it fluctuate in the uncompactified directions . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath27 monopoles are formed when the @xmath28 branes start to fall apart .",
    "the most natural situation is that the symmetry restoration is induced by the thermal effects , which break supersymmetry and glue branes together . in the effective action , the restoration of the symmetry is naturally induced by the thermal effects .",
    "the repulsive force between the two @xmath28 branes are induced by the usual supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the non - equilibrium production of such monopoles is possible during brane oscillation .",
    "the massless monopoles gain mass when the branes start to fall apart .    as a result",
    ", we conclude that the production of monopoles after brane inflation is quite natural , even if the monopoles are the daughter branes created by the usual mechanism of tachyon condensation .",
    "in the previous arguments in ref.@xcite , it was concluded that the formation of cosmological domain walls are always negligible after brane inflation , because the daughter branes must wrap the same compactified space as the mother brane .",
    "is it impossible to produce daughter branes that do not wrap the same compactified space as the mother brane ?",
    "first , we repeat the previous discussions , which suggest that the cosmological formation of domain walls is forbidden . as is discussed in ref.@xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the effect of compactification is believed to play significant roles in the defect formation due to tachyon condensation . since the compactification radius should be small compared to the horizon size during inflation , any variation of a field in the compactified direction",
    "must be suppressed . as a result",
    ", the daughter brane will wrap the same compactified space as the mother brane . at the same time , since the codimension of the daughter branes should lie within the uncompactified space , the defect is inevitably a cosmic string . on the other hand , as we have discussed in ref.@xcite for cosmic strings and in the previous section for monopoles ,",
    "it is possible to produce daughter branes that are extended between branes , which correspond to the d - term strings or monopoles in the effective action . as we have seen in the previous section , efficient production of such monopoles",
    "is allowed in generic situations . for cosmic strings ,",
    "the idea of the extended daughter brane formation was used to solve the problem of the angle - dependence of the string tension in the scenario of angled brane inflation@xcite .",
    "the cosmological formation of the extended branes plays important roles in the analyses of strings and monopoles .",
    "finally , we will examine the formation of cosmological domain walls .",
    "our purpose in this section is to examine the cosmological formation of domain walls .",
    "actually , it is possible to show an example of the domain wall formation , although this example is not a pure creation of branes induced by the tachyon condensation on the mother brane .",
    "please imagine that two coincident 5-branes are placed on top of each other . both of them have four space - time dimensions(uncompactified ) and also wrap two - dimensional compactified space .",
    "these 5-branes look like 3-branes in the limit where the wrapped space is very small .",
    "let us assume that after a phase transition these two 5-brnes finally fall apart to the true vacuum .    in this case",
    ", it is possible to add an additional 3-brane by hand , which does not wrap the same compactified space as the above 5-branes . in this case",
    ", one can assume that the latter 3-brane is not produced by the tachyon condensation on the 5-brane , but could be present from the beginning .",
    "the latter 3-brane have four ( uncompactified ) space - time dimensions , and dissolves in the 5-branes .",
    "then , it is quite natural to think that the additional 3-brane sticks to either 5-brane when the 5-branes finally fall apart .",
    "then there appears two kinds of domains in the universe , depending on which 5-brane the additional 3-brane sticks to . since the domain walls can not interact across the scale much larger than the hubble radius , one can expect that at least one domain wall is produced in one huble horizon .",
    "the resulting domain wall is the 3-brane extended between the 5-branes .",
    "we can discuss brane creation from brane sphalerons .",
    "as far as the effective action is applicable , it seems possible to create new branes that do not wrap the same compactified radius as the mother brane , even if it is initially created on the worldvolume of the mother brane .",
    "our second example for the formation of cosmological domain walls is the domain walls produced by the excitation of sphaleron - like brane configuration@xcite .",
    "brane could have their boundaries on the mother @xmath29 branes . ]",
    "the most obvious difference from the scenario of tachyon condensation is that the sphaleron - like configuration is not required to wrap the same compactified space as the mother brane , even when they are first created on the worldvolume of the mother brane . in this case , for example , cosmological domain walls can be the @xmath7 branes extended between @xmath8 branes .",
    "the schematic picture of the domain wall is given in fig.[fig : sphaleron1 ] . if there is a non - equilibrium process that enhances the long - wavelength configurations of the sphalerons",
    ", the efficient production of the sphaleron excitations will happen .",
    "then the sphaleron - like branes will recombine , as is shown in fig.[fig : sphaleron2 ] .",
    "although the production of massive sphalerons is suppressed by an exponential factor in conventional thermal processes , the production of sphalerons are not suppressed in non - equilibrium processes such as preheating after inflation .",
    "thus , the extended branes that are formed by the sphaleron - like excitations could be produced if there was a period when the long - wavelength configurations of the sphalerons are enhanced . in this case",
    ", one can not ignore the production of domain walls .",
    "the period when branes oscillate is inevitable in generic cosmological models , as we have discussed in the previous section . since the conventional electroweak sphaleron is quite similar to the sphaleron - like brane configuration in the effective action , we start the discussion comparing the electroweak sphalerons to the brane - sphalerons .",
    "first , we briefly review the sphaleron interaction in the electroweak gauge theory . at zero temperature ,",
    "the rate per unit volume of baryon number violating processes is exponentially suppressed by the factor @xmath30 in the high temperature , however , the baryon number violating processes that are mediated by sphalerons are not exponentially suppressed@xcite .",
    "the sphalerons have typically the sizes given by the magnetic correlation length @xmath31 in this case , one may think that the space is divided up into cells of this size , although these massless sphalerons look nothing like sphalerons because the `` barrier '' does not make sense when the symmetry is restored by the thermal effects .",
    "there is another idea for the sphaleron production@xcite , where the non - equilibrium sphaleron transition is used to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe .    for the brane dynamics ,",
    "sphaleron - like brane configuration is discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the configuration is described by an appropriate excitation of the transverse coordinate field , which corresponds to the higgs expectation value in the discussion of the electroweak sphalerons .",
    "here we do not repeat the analysis in ref.@xcite , because the analogy comparing the sphaleron - like brane configuration to the electroweak sphaleron seems appropriate and sufficient for qualitative discussions , as far as the effective action is applicable .",
    "the sphaleron - like brane configuration is excited when the following conditions are satisfied .",
    "* more than two branes coincide during inflation .",
    "+ after inflation , the branes fall apart toward the true vacuum configuration .",
    "in the effective action , this corresponds to the symmetry restoration during hybrid inflation .",
    "* brane inflation ends with brane collision .",

    ", this corresponds to the non - equilibrium sphaleron production , which is discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "* symmetry restoration is induced by the thermal effects . + spontaneous breaking of the symmetry in the effective action is explained by brane separation or brane recombination .",
    "sphalerons are excited when they are massless .",
    "sphalerons - like brane configuration is expanded between mother branes and obtains mass when the mother branes fall apart .    in general",
    ", one can not simply ignore the production of the sphaleron - like brane configurations , irrespective of their stability .",
    "even if there was no non - equilibrium processes that makes the sphalerons form stable global structure of massive domain wall networks , there is a possibility that unstable defects ( and their decay products ) play important roles in the evolution of the universe .",
    "is unstable , because it must shrink to a point as it obtains mass .",
    "however , in the special cases that multiple sphalerons are produced at the same time within the same horizon , multiple sphalerons will recombine into larger or smaller cells , as is depicted in fig.[fig : sphaleron2 ] .",
    "of course , it is not trivial if the sphalerons could interact each other to form the significant global structure of the domain wall networks",
    ". if the correlation length is short , sphalerons are small even if they are massless .",
    "if the nucleation rate of the sphalerons is too small to make them interact each other to form larger structure of the domain wall networks , sphalerons must shrink to a point after the phase transition . in this case , sphalerons can not become stable domain walls .",
    "therefore , it is required that a non - trivial mechanism that enhances the correlation length(or the nucleation rate of the sphalerons ) so that the sphalerons interact each other to seed the domain walls . in the scenario of preheating",
    ", the domain wall formation is already convinced by simulation . in the dynamics of brane sphalerons ,",
    "the brane distance is corresponding to the higgs field . in this respect ,",
    "the domain wall formation is likely to occur in the brane - motivated models , when some conditions are satisfied . as a result ,",

    "the domain walls formed by the spatial deformation of the branes are , at least in principle , different from the ones that are formed by the brane creation . however , since the cosmological requirement for their formation is the same@xcite , the actual cosmological defects are inevitably the mixture of the two different kinds of brane defects .",

    "in fact the statement is true , but we should be more careful about the process of the brane recombination . when the distance between the mother branes becomes shorter than a critical distance , tachyon starts to condensate on a mother brane .",
    "therefore the tachyon forms strings on the mother brane and wraps the same compactified space as the mother brane .",
