    "lyttleton ( hereafter bhl ) accretion flow , in 2d and 3d , have not only enabled the determination of the mean rate of accretion of mass , linear and angular momentum , but have also significantly modified our understanding of its dynamics .",
    "they have revealed that the accretion column foreseen by hoyle & lyttleton ( 1939 ) widens to form a detached bow shock if the adiabatic index of the accreted gas is @xmath0 ( hunt  1971 ) or @xmath3 ( hunt  1979 ) .",
    "the shock structure observed in simulations was used by eadie ( 1975 ) to interpret the x  ray observations of vel x-1 .",
    "+ real situations like wind accretion in x - ray binaries require taking into account the density and velocity gradients in the incoming flow ( see ishii  1993 and references therein ) , the effects of rotation ( see theuns  1996 and references therein ) as well as the intricacies of radiative transfer ( see an overview in blondin  1994 ) . for the sake of a better understanding , we restrict our present investigation to the axisymmetric meridional accretion of a gas with uniform adiabatic index onto a gravitating accretor with constant velocity .",
    "+ although this configuration is highly simplified , a completely unexpected non  axisymmetric instability was discovered in numerical simulations for supersonic flows ( fryxell & taam  1988 ) .",
    "this instability could explain the observed variability of the radio or x - ray luminosity in some astrophysical systems ( ruffert & melia  1994 ) .",
    "+ however , its is not easy to establish the consistency of the results of the few published 3d numerical simulations which depend on the details of the numerical method : no instability appeared in the 3d sph simulations by boffin ( 1991 ) whereas it was observed in the 3d eulerian simulations by matsuda ( 1992 and references therein ) and ruffert ( 1995 and references therein ) . dome ",
    "shaped structures frequently appeared with roe s method ( approximate riemann solver ) of matsuda ( 1991 ) , but not in the nested grid piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) of ruffert ( 1991 ) .",
    "since numerical viscosity appears to play an important role , a sufficient resolution of the simulation is crucial . in this respect ,",
    "numerical simulations encounter the following difficulty : the smallness of the accretor in simulations is limited by the computational power , because the shortest timestep of the simulation is usually determined by the region of high velocities in the vicinity of the accretor .",
    "the ratio of scales between the accretion radius and the radius @xmath4 of a compact star , moving with a supersonic velocity @xmath5 is typically of order : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "note that in the case of accretion onto a neutron star , the relevant accretor boundary is the boundary of its magnetosphere , typically a factor @xmath8 larger than the schwarzschild radius .",
    "some of the most recent 3d simulations ( ruffert  1992 , 1994a ) could allow a ratio up to @xmath9 ( the full domain of the simulation extends up to @xmath10 accretion radii ) , by using a ppm code with multiple nested grids .",
    "such an accreting sphere is still more than 100 times larger than @xmath7 , and typically @xmath11 times larger than the magnetosphere of a neutron star .",
    "one would like to be able to predict , on an analytical basis , which changes are likely to occur if the size of the accretor is further decreased .",
    "the role of the boundary conditions at the surface of the accretor is closely related to the position of the sonic surface , and we shall use analytical arguments to obtain some insights on this question .",
    "an analytical description of axisymmetric stationary flows is also a first step towards the analysis of their stability , which we postpone to a future paper .",
    "bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1979 ) found self - similar stationary solutions , and one would like to know to what extent any generic stationary solution would behave in the same way as their solution .",
    "more generality is gained by studying , in the same spirit as theuns & david ( 1992 ) for the spherical case , the first order behaviour of all quantities near the accretor for an axisymmetric flow , and in particular their departure from sphericity .",
    "some analytic formulae have been proposed to fit the mass accretion rate observed in simulations ( hunt  1979 ; ruffert  1994b ) , but none of them filled the gap between the well studied cases of axisymmetric accretion of dust ( hoyle & lyttleton  1939 ; bondi & hoyle  1944 ) on the one hand , and spherical accretion of a gas ( bondi  1952 ) on the other , for an arbitrary value of the adiabatic index .",
    "continuing in this direction , we add to these reference models the spherical accretion of a shocked gas with uniform adiabatic index , in order to see the effect of both the kinetic and the thermal energies , and extend this approach to axisymmetric meridional stationary flows .",

    "+ the topology of the flow in numerical simulations appears to depend strongly on the size of the accretor : all the supersonic flows are of type fsf if the accretor is big enough , but some become type sf or f when the accretor size is decreased . in order to spare computing time , which increases with decreasing accretor size",
    ", one would like to use the largest accretor size leading to a physically relevant accretion process ( cf .",
