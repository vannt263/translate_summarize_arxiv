    "decoherence is an important issue in the practical realization of quantum computers , as it hinders the preservation and controlled manipulation of quantum information .",
    "@xcite combating decoherence in various quantum computing architectures has thus attracted a lot of attention from both theoretical and experimental communities in recent years . in this line of research",
    ", decoherence typically refers to the loss of quantum coherence in a system of controlled qubits due to the entanglement generated by inevitable couplings to the external environment .",
    "significant efforts and progress have been made to reduce such couplings while maintaining the ability to reliably control the quantum system .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we investigate a related , but distinct concept , the `` intrinsic decoherence '' in an _ isolated _ quantum system without any explicit coupling to the external environment .",
    "the decoherence here refers to the erasure of local quantum information in an initial non - eigenstate as the isolated system relaxes by itself ( through interaction ) to thermalization .",
    "this is motivated by the recent developments in the study of many - body localization ,  @xcite where an interacting , isolated quantum system resists thermalization under strong disorder and retains indefinitely the quantum memory in its initial , highly excited state .",
    "@xcite here we take a closer look at the thermalization ( or relaxation ) dynamics in terms of both local observables and the global return probability .",
    "we aim to construct a quantitative measure of the gradual erasure of the initial state information during the time evolution of the isolated system , and study the dependence of the erasure rate on the disorder strength .",
    "the decoherence considered here arises from an intricate interplay between external noise ( as manifested in the disorder ) and interaction among all the qubits in the circuit , and is thus quite distinct from the corresponding purely environmental single - qubit decoherence considered in the context of quantum computing architectures .",
    "we use the word `` decoherence '' here in a loose qualitative manner ( for example , `` relaxation '' rather than `` decoherence '' would have been an equally appropriate nomenclature here ) , but define the intrinsic decoherence time rather precisely ( with respect to the initial state ) so that there is no semantic confusion .",
    "the important point to be emphasized is that the intrinsic decoherence being studied here is a property of the _ whole _ interacting many - body system , and is not a single - qubit phenomenon .",
    "we define a new quantity , dubbed the `` intrinsic decoherence time '' , by thresholding the decay of the disorder - averaged return probability after a certain rescaling .",
    "this quantity captures the timescale over which the system loses track of the local information in the initial state under its own dynamics .",
    "we pay special attention to ensure that the intrinsic decoherence time thus defined is insensitive to finite - size effects and extrapolates properly to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we study this new quantity in four different models for both spins and interacting fermions .",
    "there is background disorder in all the models , and the models are , by definition , interacting models as each spin or fermion interacts with others . across the different models , we consistently find that the intrinsic decoherence time increases monotonically as the disorder strength increases ( presumably diverging in the many - body - localized systems where local initial state memory is preserved forever ) , and it only displays rather moderate dependence on system size with a reasonable scaling behavior . for comparison ,",
    "we have also computed similar timescales extracted from local observables such as magnetization and density imbalance .",
    "we find that these timescales also exhibit similar monotonic dependence on disorder , giving confidence in the belief that the intrinsic decoherence time is an experimentally accessible physical property characterizing the relaxation dynamics of disordered interacting many - body systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ising ] we examine the dynamics of the disorder - averaged return probability in the transverse - field ising model , and discuss the proper definition of the intrinsic decoherence time based on the per - site return probability .",
    "we further characterize the intrinsic decoherence time in another three different models , namely , the nearest - neighbor heisenberg model with a random magnetic field in sec .",
    "[ sec : heisenberg ] , the anderson model of the interacting fermions with a random on - site potential in sec .",

    ", we consider a linear array of coupled trapped - ion qubits , described by the disordered transverse - field ising model  @xcite @xmath0 with some minor modifications , the same hamiltonian , in principle , applies also to the capacitively - coupled singlet - triplet semiconductor spin qubits .",

    "mathematically this is reminiscent of ( although physically different from ) the damped rabi oscillations of a single qubit due to couplings to the external environment .",
    "naively , one may try to extract a decoherence timescale from the decaying envelope in the same spirit as the relaxation time @xmath17 obtained from rabi oscillations .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , this intuitive picture of a damped oscillator breaks down once the system grows beyond a couple of qubits , and no such simple analogy to rabi oscillations or noninteracting single qubit systems is possible in the multiqubit situation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ising - rp - dynamics](b ) , we find that for @xmath14 qubits , the disorder - averaged return probability @xmath12 does not exhibit a gradual decay of oscillations .",
    "instead , @xmath12 undergoes a monotonic , steep decline followed by weak irregular oscillations with no clear decay envelope . in other words , when the disordered quantum system has a large enough hilbert space , we find that the erasure of the initial state information occurs mostly at the beginning of the time evolution .",
    "this motivates us to depart from the usual approach of characterizing the decaying envelope , and instead focus on the monotonic decline of @xmath12 at the beginning .",
    "to this end , we impose an ( arbitrary ) threshold @xmath18 on @xmath12 and define an `` effective decoherence time '' @xmath15 as the moment when @xmath12 drops below @xmath18 for the first time , @xmath19 figure  [ fig : ising - rp - dynamics](c ) illustrates the thresholding procedure using @xmath20 on the @xmath14 data as an example .",

    "the quantity @xmath15 defined above characterizes the time needed for the isolated system to relax from the initial state , and it may serve as a characteristic timescale for such intrinsic decoherence . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ising - t - pristine ] , we examine the dependence of @xmath15 on the disorder strength @xmath6 for various system sizes @xmath21 .",
    "we observe that @xmath15 slightly increases as disorder @xmath6 increases , consistent with the intuition that a strong disorder impedes thermalization and induces localization .",
    "however , we also find that @xmath15 suffers from a severe system - size dependence , dropping sharply as the number of qubits @xmath21 increases .",
    "the size dependence completely eclipses the variation of @xmath15 as the disorder strength @xmath6 changes . from the linear extrapolation in fig .",
    "[ fig : ising - t - pristine](b ) , even the qualitative trend of the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath15 may shift from increasing to decreasing when the system size is large enough .",
    "it therefore appears that although @xmath15 seems to be a reasonable quantity , its use as an effective system decoherence time is fraught with the pitfalls of severe finite size effects .",
    "such an undesirable behavior of @xmath15 is rooted in its definition based on thresholding the return probability . for a many - qubit system ,",
    "the return probability has a strong system - size dependence from the dilution effect in the exponentially large hilbert space .",
    "as the system size @xmath21 increases , the fixed threshold @xmath18 on the disorder - averaged return probability becomes effectively easier to reach .",
    "thus , the effective decoherence time @xmath15 for the whole system turns out to be a poor definition or characterization for intrinsic decoherence because of uncontrolled finite size effects , although it may very well work for a system with finite and fixed number of qubits .    to get around the system - size dependence",
    ", we now introduce the `` per - site '' return probability for a system of @xmath21 qubits by taking the @xmath21-th root of the usual return probability , and define its disorder average as @xmath23 here , the @xmath21-th root effectively folds the exponentially large hilbert space of @xmath21 qubits so that @xmath24 behaves like the effective fidelity of a single qubit .",
    "this rescaling can also be understood in a spirit similar to the per - site error in density - matrix - renormalization - group calculations .",

    "it is thus instructive to compare the behavior of @xmath26 with the corresponding decay time of local observables . as a specific example , we compute the dynamics of the normalized hamming distance .",

    "<S> we study the intrinsic , disorder - induced decoherence of an isolated quantum system under its own dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we investigate the characteristic timescale ( i.e. the decoherence time ) associated with an interacting many - body system losing the memory of its initial state . to characterize the erasure of the initial state memory , </S>",
    "<S> we define a new timescale , the intrinsic decoherence time , by thresholding the gradual decay of the disorder - averaged return probability . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the system - size independence of the intrinsic decoherence time in different models , and we study its dependence on the disorder strength . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the intrinsic decoherence time increases monotonically as the disorder strength increases in accordance with the relaxation of locally measurable quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate several interacting spin ( e.g. ising and heisenberg ) and fermion ( e.g. anderson and aubry - andr ) models to obtain the intrinsic decoherence time as a function of disorder and interaction strength . </S>"
