    "formulating strong - field transport in electron lattice has always been one of the most challenging theoretical goals in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "this is more true with today s advanced nano - lithography techniques where we can now realize electron lattice driven far from equilibrium . even though this is an old problem , we are still in search of a firm theoretical paradigm to approach the problem in general .",
    "one of the central puzzles is dissipation . in equilibrium ,",
    "the presence of an open environment in contact with a system introduces thermalization , and once the temperature is defined , we often use canonical or grand canonical ensemble , and do not consider the coupling to the environment as an explicit parameter .",
    "we naturally ask whether such simplifying ansatz may be possible in nonequilibrium , at least for steady - state description .    in nonequilibrium , we do not know such tremendously simplifying paradigms to take the role of the environment as an implicit parameter which can be hidden in thermalization process . on the contrary",
    ", the dissipation is considered as an integral part of the nonequilibrium process , and we need to include the dissipation mechanism explicitly for sound theoretical description . in some systems , however , the dissipation process can be simplified . in quantum dots ( qds ) under a finite dc bias , electron reservoirs coupled to the qd also act as energy source / drain and the energy relaxation is assumed to happen far away from qd and inside a battery .",
    "the electrical leads are then modeled as non - interacting reservoirs , and the electron transport is viewed as a transmission problem  @xcite . by taking the open limit , the excess energy can be taken infinitely far away from the qd , and the problem supports steady - state  @xcite .",
    "various quantum simulation methods have been proposed to study the transient behaviors of interacting models  @xcite . in the limit where a steady - state exists ,",
    "the nonequilibrium state can also be described within the time - independent statistical mechanics framework  @xcite , from which hershfield  @xcite proposed the nonequilibrium density matrix @xmath6,\\ ] ] with the reservoir energy @xmath7 for the source ( @xmath8 ) and drain ( @xmath9 ) with the continuum index @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the creation operator of the full scattering state as the solution of the _ whole _ system of quantum dot and the leads .",
    "@xmath12 is the chemical potential of the respective reservoirs . the scattering state formulation ,",
    "although conceptually appealing , has initially been applied only to limited models  @xcite due to the difficulty of finding the scattering states . in recent years",
    ", several steady - state methods  @xcite have been developed and have been extended to general models .",
    "recently , the attention of the field has turned to lattice nonequilbrium problems . even at a very stage of the field",
    ", there have been important findings in the nonequilbrium processes , most notably that electrons under a dc electric field seem to build up internal energy quite quickly , reaching a quite different steady - state from equilibrium strongly correlated states  @xcite .",
    "one of the most popular technique of solving lattice many - body models has been the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite .",
    "its success has been well documented in the description of the mott transition and strong - correlation physics in equilibrium .",
    "while there have been a fair amount of dmft works to electric - field driven lattice systems , the validity of the local approximation is still unconfirmed and subject to intense debate .    there have been numerous attempts to simulate nonequilibrium physics in lattice models , often through isolated hamiltonians  @xcite suited for quench dynamics of cold atom systems in optical lattice , periodically driven systems  @xcite , and some basic dissipation models  @xcite .",
    "however , in part due to the numerical difficulties in simulating long time - evolution , most of the efforts have focused on high - field phenomena such as the dielectric breakdown in mott insulators  @xcite .",
    "the main emerging picture of the calculations is that the external field drives the electronic lattice systems into hot temperature , generally regardless of the nature of many - body interaction . even though the picture is in agreement between many groups ,",
    "the detailed understanding of the nature of the hot electron state and its eventual fate in more realistic setting is not available . to gain systematic understanding of such nonequilibrium state , the dissipation",
    "should be included in explicit models and their analytic behavior has to be studied with the damping as a controlled parameter .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to introduce steady - state formulation via scattering state method for lattice with fermion baths and comprehensively analyze the model to show that the system possesses many properties which are expected of physical systems , for instance , consistent picture as the boltzmann transport theory . in the process , an argument will be made that the fermion bath model and the steady - state methods are a good minimal system to study nonequilibrium strong correlation physics . in the previous paper  @xcite by one of authors , the fermion bath model under a dc electric field has been shown to reproduce the key ingredients as predicted by the classical boltzmann transport theory , and to have a stead - state solution .",
    "the occupation number as a function of mechanical momentum has been shown to have the fermi sea shift by the drift velocity proportional to the scattering time and the electric field .",
    "furthermore , the dc current has been derived to be consistent with the boltzmann transport result applied to nanostructures  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we further develop the solution to show that the scattering state formulation is applicable , and therefore a wide range of new techniques can be developed to solve the interacting lattice nonequilibrium phenomena .",
    "explicit calculations from temporal gauge and the coulomb gauge with scattering state formulation show that they are completely consistent with each other .",
    "the coulomb gauge enables the time - independent formalism , making physical interpretations more transparent .",
    "we calculate explicitly the local distribution function , from which we derive that the effective temperature scales as @xmath13 with a numerical constant @xmath1 , tight - binding parameter @xmath2 , the bloch oscillation frequency @xmath3 and the damping parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the effective temperature exhibits a singular limit of @xmath14 for @xmath5 .",
    "this proves that one should not take the damping as an implicit process , as treated in equilibrium theory .",
    "finally we derive , via the energy flux conservation with the joule heating , a general dc current relation as a functional of local green s functions as an extension of the meir - wingreen formula  @xcite to lattice models , and confirm the linear response theory .",
    "the main text of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the method introduced in ref .",
    "is further developed for green s functions in the temporal gauge . in section iii",
    ", we introduce the coulomb gauge and show that the green s functions in both gauges become identical in the long - time limit . in section iii",
    "we further discuss several important nonequilibrium quantities : the local distribution function and the effective temperature in a , time - evolution of wave - packet in b , dissipation and energy flux in c , and finally the derivation of the dc current in interacting models in d. appendices provide detailed analytic calculations .",
