    "this is also the case experimentally , as the samples become _ x - ray amorphous _ with no usable diffraction peaks to determine the structure . furthermore , in the computation of xanes and exafs spectra , the absence of symmetry means that the excitation response of each atom is unique and can be very distinct . as spectral measurements are effective samplings of individual excitations of atoms in different local chemical environments , an average over a large number of sites must be considered in a theoretical approach .",
    "while detailed explanation for the formation of non - crystalline phases during pvd in certain carbide systems remains unclear , it involves a significant quenching for conditions with neutral atoms and substrate temperatures below the melting point of the carbide , giving rise to limited surface mobility where atoms only find locally favorable sites .",

    "this signifies that the carbide structure remains the same , independent of carbon content . for the second coordination shell corresponding to larger cr - cr and cr - c distances between 3.7 - 4.2  , it is interesting to notice that the relative intensity is rather independent of carbon content while the shape changes .",
    "figure 8 shows theoretical ( radial ) pair distribution functions g(r ) obtained directly from the sq structures for amorphous cr@xmath14c@xmath13 , cr@xmath15c@xmath15 , and cr@xmath13c@xmath14 . from top to bottom , the graphs display g(r ) for cr - cr , cr - c and c - c , respectively .",
    "the inset is zoomed in on the first cr - cr peak , illustrating the small but distinct shift to larger cr - cr distances upon increasing carbon content .",
    "the pair distribution function g(r ) is related to the reduced pair distribution function g(r ) by g(r)=g(r)/4@xmath56@xmath57 + 1 , where @xmath57 is the average number density of the material .",
    "the ( radial ) pair - distribution function is normalized so that g(r ) @xmath42 1 when r @xmath42 @xmath58 @xcite .",

    ", we generally observe that the crystalline bond lengths are similar to both the theoretical fully amorphous structures and measurements ( table 2 ) , and the coordination numbers are closer to the measurements . considering the bond lengths , cr@xmath5c@xmath9 phases give the closest fit with the xanes measurements ( table 1 ) . from the fitting of the xanes measurements to the theoretical results , we find that the dominant contribution is amorphous crc@xmath1 carbide with a coordination that is most similar to cr@xmath5c@xmath6 carbide in all the samples , ranging from @xmath47 30 at% .",
    "this is followed by less possible contributions of coordination similar to cr@xmath7c@xmath8 , cr@xmath9c@xmath12 and cr@xmath9c .",

    "@xcite .",
    "@xmath59    in table 3 , a very small increase of both the cr - c and cr - cr bond lengths as a function of c content is predicted in the theoretical purely amorphous structures .",
    "this is consistent with the observed increase in crystal carbide lattice parameters when they are present in nanocrystal form in a carbon matrix  @xcite .",
    "this trend is possibly due to the fact that the carbon - rich environment induces charge - transfer that reduces the electron concentration around the cr atoms with a following reduction of the strength of cr - cr bonding .",
    "in addition , our calculations of pure amorphous materials predict a reduction of the coordination numbers of cr and an increase of coordination numbers of c as a function of carbon content .",
    "the predicted reduction of the coordination number of cr is consistent with our measurements .",
    "however , an increase in the coordination number of c is only experimentally observed between the 25% and 42% samples while at higher c contents , a weak decrease is observed .",
    "this could be due to the fact that the size of the amorphous crc@xmath1 carbide and amorphous carbon domains changes as a function of total carbon content . as observed in transmission electron microscopy ( tem )  @xcite , domain sizes are less than 1 nm for x=0.25 , about 3 nm for x=0.47 , and about 2 nm for the higher carbon contents .",
    "thus , the situation in amorphous nanocomposites is more complex than in pure amorphous materials as there is also a contribution from the interface grain boundaries that changes as a function of total carbon content . furthermore , for the crc@xmath1 carbide phase , there are at least two different competing effects that can give rise to a change in bond length : i ) at low c - content , the cr - rich phase has vacancies that cause an increase or an decrease of the lattice constant that has a maximum for under - stoichiometric carbide .",
    "ii ) more carbon atoms filling into the vacancies of the structure gives rise to a larger lattice parameter @xmath51 , see e.g. , ref .  @xcite .    in a previous experimental study on the same samples  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath33=0.25 was observed to have the most amorphous character , in high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) .",
    "a possible interpretation is that the low carbon concentration sample can be described with a cr@xmath5c@xmath6 coordination with @xmath60 -0.5 , prohibited from forming the optimal structure by carbon vacancies .",
    "the fitting with theoretical xanes spectra ( table 1 ) does not indicate a change in structure or a possible concentration of bcc - cr , while having the lowest amorphous character as compared with the other samples .",
    "we find that in general , exafs modeling can give useful information about the local structure in amorphous materials but largely depends on the chosen model .",
    "therefore , it is important to use _ ab initio _ theory as a complement .    while the present work focus on new theoretical and experimental results for the cr @xmath2-edge , the corresponding results for the _ carbon _ @xmath2-edge can provide valuable complementary information .",
    "therefore , it is also of interest to compare the theoretical c - c bond for the amorphous structures and crystallites ( fig .  8 , 9 and table 3 ) with measurements . generally , the calculated cr - c and cr - cr bond lengths were found to be rather similar between the crystallites and amorphous structures . however , the theoretical c - c bond distances are strikingly different in amorphous carbides ( @xmath471.5  ) compared to crystalline carbide materials ( @xmath473  ) , which are closer to the second c - c coordination shell . as discussed in a previous work  @xcite",
    ", these results qualitatively agree well with the relative distribution of carbon in the carbidic , crc@xmath1 phase and the amorphous carbon phase as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the c - c bond lengths are @xmath471.5  in a - c , graphite and diamond  @xcite .",
    "the experimentally observed c - c bond lengths ( @xmath472  )  @xcite are larger than the theoretical , but significantly shorter than the bonds for the crc crystallites in table 3 , which are similar to previous calculations  @xcite .",
    "note that in this study , the cr - c bond length ( @xmath47 2.0  ) was extracted from exafs modeling , while in ref .  @xcite the bond length ( @xmath47 2.2  ) was only estimated directly from the rdf obtained from electron energy loss spectroscopy with lower energy resolution .",
    "with the combination of experiment and theory for xanes and exafs , we have shown that it is possible to obtain detailed information about the local structure in amorphous nanocomposite materials . using the computationally efficient _ ab initio _",
    "stochastic quenching method , we modeled fully amorphous structures , taking into account local cr magnetic moments in the derivation . experimentally , amorphous structures require advanced fitting procedures where the result is very sensitive to the structure of the model .",
    "amorphous two - phase cr@xmath0c@xmath1 nanocomposite films were investigated , consisting of a chromium - rich amorphous carbide phase and an amorphous carbon - rich phase .",
    "we find that the short - range coordination in the cr - rich amorphous phase is similar to that of a hexagonal cr@xmath5c@xmath6 structure . at total carbon contents below 30 at% ,",
    "the cr - rich phase is clearly under - stoichiometric with carbon vacancies that causes shorter cr - cr bond lengths and directly depend on the packing and orbital overlap with the cr - c bonds .",
    "furthermore , the cr - cr bond length in the amorphous carbide has shorter bond lengths than the more open structure of bcc - cr metal ( space diagonal=2.49  , lattice parameter @xmath51=2.88  ) that indicates stronger bonds .",
    "above 30 at% total carbon content , the structure of the amorphous cr@xmath5c@xmath6-like domains remains , while the excessive carbons assemble in the amorphous carbon phase .",
    "the coordination numbers in the first coordination shell of cr decreases as a function of total carbon content from 9.5 to 4.6 , while the coordination number of c only weakly increases .",
    "this is associated with a smaller number and size of the cr - rich domains causing a larger fraction of interface bonding that lacks cr - nearest neighbors on one side .",
    "theoretically , we also predict that the c - c bond lengths are very sensitive to the local structure , with considerably shorter bond lengths in amorphous materials ( @xmath471.5 ) compared to various crystals ( @xmath472.8 - 3.2 ) . generally , it is important to use theory as an assessment to investigate the trends in complex amorphous materials .",
