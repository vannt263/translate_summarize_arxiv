    "the realisation of gaseous atomic bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in 1995 @xcite sparked intense theoretical and experimental interest in this hitherto inaccessible quantum degenerate regime .",
    "several landmark experiments have followed , and activity in the field continues to escalate @xcite .",
    "there has been a similar heightened interest in the area of experimental atom - optics , following the demonstration of a variety of techniques for manipulating cold atoms @xcite .    as becs",
    "are the ultimate coherent cold atom source , it has become important to develop high - quality atom - optical elements for manoeuvring them without destroying their coherence .",
    "potentials typically used for atom - optical manipulation arise from magnetic and/or optical dipole forces .",
    "we will focus in particular on the use of cold atoms in conjunction with atomic mirrors and lenses .",
    "flat @xcite and curved @xcite optical dipole mirrors , as well as flat @xcite and curved @xcite magnetic mirrors have all been realised with conventional cold atoms in static configurations .",
    "dynamic optical dipole mirrors @xcite , flat @xcite and curved @xcite dynamic magnetic mirrors , as well as 1d @xcite and 3d @xcite dynamic magnetic lensing have all been demonstrated .",
    "the temporal variability provided by such mirrors and lenses adds an extra dimension of control .",
    "however , dynamic magnetic mirrors and lenses tend to be softer than their static counterparts  i.e. atoms have a longer interaction distance with the mirror potential .",
    "the optical quality of the original static mirrors has been refined @xcite and a natural extension is the use of these relatively hard mirrors as atom - optical elements to focus and image coherent atomic sources such as becs .",
    "first steps in this direction were made in the experiment of bongs _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the ingredients of a bec and atomic mirror were successfully combined with the demonstration of condensate reflection from a flat spatial dipole mirror based on a rapidly rastered laser beam .",
    "our mirror has the additional advantages that it can be inelastic , with an adaptable radius of curvature .",
    "here we give a more detailed description of our earlier work @xcite on the reflection and focusing of a bec from this soft curved temporal magnetic mirror .",
    "a similar mirror has been used to reflect , focus and store atom laser beams @xcite .",
    "the ability to adaptively focus and launch condensates will enable the realisation of becs with very high densities , and it has already enabled us to create extremely cold and coherent collimated atomic clouds .",
    "an important aspect of our mirror design is that all magnetic elements are a relatively large distance @xmath1 mm ) from the atoms .",
    "thus , although the magnetic fields are relatively weak compared to hard atomic mirrors in which the atoms make a close @xmath2 m approach to the magnetic surface , microscopic corrugations in the mirror potential are drastically reduced because curvature in the magnetic field scales as @xmath3 such large - scale mirrors thus have the advantage that they are extremely smooth , ensuring fully coherent atomic manipulation .",
    "the roughness of our mirror was measured to be less than @xmath4mrad rms @xcite , where this upper bound was probably only limited by the sensitivity of the measurement technique , and our atomic mirror is therefore one of the smoothest in the world @xcite .",
    "we begin the discussion with an overview of our ` simple ' bec apparatus , followed by benchmarking experiments that were performed on the condensates .",
    "we will then concentrate on bouncing and focusing becs : contrasting and discussing the limitations of two theories , paying particular attention to the theory of experimentally attainable situations .",
    "in the sussex bec experiment @xmath5 @xmath0rb atoms can be collected at the low pressure end of a low - power double magneto - optical trap ( mot ) @xcite system ( fig .  [ setup ] ) .",
    "the three extended - cavity diode lasers providing the necessary @xmath6 nm @xmath7 mot light have a very simple , stable design and can be cheaply manufactured from commercially available components with minimal machining @xcite .",
    "a single diode laser originally provided all trap laser light for the bec experiment @xmath8mw total per mot in @xmath9 mm diameter ( fwhm=@xmath10 mm ) beams ) , however two independent lasers are now used for the high pressure and low pressure mots  increasing the low pressure mot atom number with a minor cost to simplicity .",
    "for both mots the trap laser light is detuned @xmath11mhz ( i.e. red ) of the @xmath12 transition , whilst the repumping light is resonant with the @xmath13 line .",
    "every @xmath14ms the @xmath15 atoms that have accumulated in the high pressure mot are transferred to the low pressure mot simply using the light pressure from a @xmath16s push pulse of saturated light resonant with the @xmath12 transition .",
    "the shape of the apparatus ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) and the relatively small angular spread of the transferred atoms allow the realisation of a moderate @xmath17 transfer efficiency without requiring a magnetic guiding mechanism .",
    "the low pressure mot is loaded with @xmath18 atoms in @xmath19s , however faster loading times could be achieved by inserting an aperture in the transfer tube  increasing the present @xmath20 mot pressure ratio .",
    "we find that a dark / compressed mot phase @xcite is unnecessary for bec production , however this small complication would no doubt improve the condensate population .",
    "the atoms in the low pressure mot are cooled to @xmath21k in optical molasses @xmath22mhz ) , then optically pumped into the @xmath23 state using a circularly - polarised light pulse resonant with the @xmath24 transition . a ioffe - pritchard ( ip ) @xcite magnetic trap is subsequently formed around the atoms .",
    "the constant magnetic field in the lp mot chamber can be altered in @xmath25ms using three orthogonal pairs of magnetic coils  thus providing the necessary field for molasses and optical pumping as well as positioning the lp mot centre relative to the ip trap .",
    "absorption imaging of the atoms is performed with the optical pumping laser beam .",
    "the imaging lens is an @xmath26 cm doublet designed to minimise distortion , with a magnification of @xmath27 the short @xmath28s ) pulse of near - resonant imaging light propagates horizontally at an angle of @xmath29 to the @xmath30 axis of the magnetic trap .",
    "we refer to the resulting horizontal axis in our images as @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) .",
    "the imaging / optical pumping beam , like the push beam , is derived from the high pressure mot trap laser .",
    "the intensities of all laser beams derived from the two trap diode lasers can be altered in times @xmath32s via their corresponding constant - frequency acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) .",
    "complete extinction of all laser light ( important during magnetic trapping ) is realised using mechanical shutters .",
    "as the free - running rms laser linewidth is @xmath33khz ( for times @xmath34ms ) , the laser frequencies can be precisely adjusted over @xmath35mhz simply by unlocking the laser and making small , abrupt changes to the laser current .",
    "the ioffe - pritchard magnetic trap coils are formed from water - cooled @xmath36 mm o.d .",
    "copper tubing : a 9-turn ` cuboidal ' baseball coil with average side dimensions @xmath37mm@xmath38 and two three - turn @xmath39mm@xmath40 ` rectangular ' bias coils .",
    "the coils @xmath41v , @xmath42a constant - voltage power supply was controlled by two simple but effective integrator circuits driving independent water - cooled banks of mosfets @xcite .",
    "series rms current noise levels of @xmath43 were obtained , and the absence of shunt resistors across both the baseball and bias coils ensured the maximum level of frequency - insensitive magnetic noise cancellation when the coils were operated completely in series @xcite .",
    "the magnetic trap s residual bias field of @xmath41 g could be lowered to @xmath44 g using a pair of extra bias coils . with a typical compressed magnetic bias field of @xmath4 g",
    "the axial and radial trapping frequencies were measured to be @xmath45hz and @xmath46hz respectively at a magnetic trap current of @xmath47a .",
    "bec experiments commonly use two or more large - throughput vacuum pumps , however due to the relatively small surface area of our apparatus the vacuum is essentially maintained by a single @xmath10l / s ion pump ( fig .  [ setup ] ) .",
    "the lifetime of the magnetic trap , @xmath48s , is certainly adequate for obtaining condensates .    after a @xmath49s rf evaporative cooling ramp pure condensates",
    "are reproducibly obtained with more than @xmath50 atoms .",
    "two ` bench - marking ' experiments were performed on our bec : the temperature - dependent ground - state occupation was compared with the results of refs . @xcite and",
    "the bec s ballistic expansion @xcite was contrasted with a thomas - fermi @xcite theoretical model @xcite .",
    "our data yielded good agreement with these earlier results , and more details of our ground - state occupation experiment will be given shortly .",
    "for our ballistic expansion experiments , absorption imaging was only valid for condensate expansion times @xmath51ms ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) due to the expected lensing effects @xcite . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , non - destructive imaging @xcite will be used in future to probe the condensate s behaviour at short release times .",
    "a variety of models have been used by different groups to model the condensate and non - condensate fractions of cold atomic clouds .",
    "three density distributions commonly used in bec data analysis will be summarised here :    * the gaussian distribution + @xmath52 $ ] * the ` bose ' distribution + @xmath53 $ ] + where @xmath54 is the polylogarithm function @xmath55 * the thomas - fermi distribution + @xmath56.$ ]    the density distribution obtained from absorption imaging is integrated along the line of sight of the probe laser beam . by using the co - ordinate transformation into the @xmath57 ( imaging ) frame @xmath58 and integrating along the absorption imaging beam axis @xmath59 one obtains the equivalent ` two - dimensional ' density for each of these distributions : @xmath60 ,     \\label{g2d}\\ ] ] @xmath61 ,     \\label{b2d}\\ ] ] @xmath62^{3/2 } ,     \\label{tf2d}\\ ] ] where the width parameters @xmath63 @xmath64 and the maximum tf radii @xmath65 @xmath66 have the same angular dependence , i.e. @xmath67 in the sussex bec experiment the viewing angle of the camera is @xmath68 because the probe laser optical access to the vacuum cell is constrained by the ip magnetic trap coils . in order to obtain a viewing angle along one of the magnetic trap axes it would be necessary to directly overlay the probe laser beam with the mot laser beams .",
    "this could be done in future by placing polarising beamsplitters in front of the mot quarter - wave plates  thus allowing light to be coupled into the mot beam path , then coupled out again after passing through the vacuum cell .",
    "the different models used by previous groups to measure the condensate ground state occupation used either a bi - modal gaussian distribution @xcite , a ` bose'/thomas - fermi distribution for the thermal / condensate populations @xcite , or a bimodal gaussian distribution with a separate gaussian fit to the ` wings ' of the distribution to measure the temperature @xcite .",
    "we found that , for our trap parameters and within experimental uncertainties , the atomic distributions were fit equally well with a gaussian / thomas - fermi or bose / thomas - fermi distribution .",
    "we found that bi - modal gaussian fits were consistently worse compared to these two models .",
    "this was expected due to the high condensate density @xmath69 in our magnetic trap , which ensured the applicability of the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "[ ntgraf ] illustrates the gaussian / thomas - fermi and bose / thomas - fermi fits . in the left graph",
    "the temperature is derived directly from the gaussian or bose distribution fitted to the thermal atoms , whereas in the right graph the temperature is determined by fitting a gaussian to the ` wings ' of the distribution ( like in ref .",
    "atoms moving adiabatically in a magnetic field experience a potential , @xmath70@xmath71@xmath72 that depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field , @xmath73 as well as the strength and sign of their atomic state s magnetic moment in the direction of @xmath74 @xmath75 .",
    "initial magnetic focusing experiments with neutral atoms @xcite have involved cylindrically symmetric systems comprised of one or two circular coils",
    ". judicious application of pulses of magnetic potential with positive axial curvature ( and negative radial curvature ) followed by a magnetic potential pulse with negative axial curvature allows one to three - dimensionally focus a cold cloud of atoms which passes through the coils @xcite .    ideally , one would like to focus the atoms with a single magnetic pulse as the dynamics are much simpler .",
    "the bec experiment already relies on a magnetic potential with positive curvature in all three spatial dimensions ",
    "i.e. the magnetic trap  this trap is therefore ideal for 3d atom focusing , and for large enough fields it can also be used as a mirror .",
    "another advantage of using the same coils for bec formation and magnetic bouncing / focusing is that one does not need to precisely position the respective centres of two different coil systems .",
    "a simpler , separate mirror consisting of two coils in a quadrupole configuration can be built @xcite , however along the axis of the coils the magnetic field magnitude varies linearly , resulting in only 2d focusing .",
    "a final pair of magnetic coils was used to generate a vertical bias field @xmath76 whilst the atoms are ` bouncing ' on the ip potential .",
    "the time - dependent magnetic field to second - order is thus : @xmath77 where the ip trap s magnetic bias , gradient and curvature @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 respectively ) are proportional to the series current in the trap coils , and the centre of the magnetic trap is shifted vertically upward by the variable amount @xmath81 the magnitude of the magnetic field is parabolic in the axial @xmath82 direction , but hyperbolic in the co - ordinate @xmath83 and thus linear for radii @xmath84    in the experiment , a condensate is released at time @xmath85 and expands ballistically until @xmath86ms when both the ip trap ( at @xmath87 of the @xmath47a maximum current ) and a constant vertical bias field @xmath88 g ) are pulsed on for @xmath89ms .",
    "after @xmath19ms an identical magnetic field pulse allows the realisation of a second ` bounce ' . during the ` bounce ' pulses the atoms experience a magnetic field magnitude that is weakly confining ( parabolic ) in the @xmath90 direction , strongly confining ( with strength dependent on @xmath91 in the @xmath92 direction and almost linear in the @xmath93 direction ( see fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "linear spatial dependence of the magnetic field magnitude results simply in a change of the centre - of - mass motion ( bouncing ) , whereas parabolic dependence yields focusing / defocusing of the atomic cloud ( fig .",
    "[ bouncetute ] ) .    during reflection",
    "the com motion changes slightly as the vertical magnetic bias is altered because its field has a small amount of curvature .",
    "horizontal motion arises partly due to a tilt in the ip trap with respect to gravity , and also due to the fact that the magnetic potentials have an increasingly large slope in the @xmath90 direction as @xmath93 decreases .",
    "this @xmath94 term in the magnetic field magnitude also causes the cloud to begin rotation in the @xmath95 plane during the bounce .",
    "we have experimentally studied situations where the drop height compared to the mirror radius of curvature in the @xmath92 direction is @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively , with the results illustrated in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite . due to our imaging angle",
    ", the instability of the condensate in the @xmath92 direction is not seen in the @xmath99 direction until after the second bounce .",
    "we now turn to the theoretical analysis of the bouncing experiments .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that a bec , in the thomas - fermi regime and experiencing a time - dependent parabolic potential @xmath100 has an atomic spatial distribution which obeys the simple scaling law : @xmath101   \\label{tf1 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the solution of @xmath103 @xmath104 and the initial bec maximal radii are @xmath105 we note that if the parabolic potential has a time - varying centre @xmath106 i.e. if @xmath107 then the _ same _ scaling law applies for the bec if one subtracts out the centre - of - mass ( com ) motion @xmath108 and uses the magnetic curvatures acting at the com .",
    "the second theoretical model is a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "initial positions for @xmath109 atoms distributed on a spherical thomas - fermi distribution , @xmath110,$ ] can be obtained by inverting the equations arising from the cumulative density function  @xmath111  i.e. by uniformly choosing @xmath112,$ ] @xmath113,$ ] and @xmath114 $ ] and by inverting @xmath115 and @xmath116 to obtain @xmath117 and @xmath118    the initial cartesian positions of the atoms @xmath119 in a cylindrically symmetric trap @xmath120 are then given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 @xmath123 and @xmath124 is the chemical potential .",
    "the bec s spatial distribution has a @xmath125ms expansion in which the co - ordinates @xmath126 are scaled by eq .",
    "[ tf2 ] , with corresponding velocities @xmath127 for times @xmath128ms , when the density of the condensate and thus the effect of interatomic repulsion has dropped dramatically , the atoms are allowed to follow their classical ballistic trajectories .",
    "our magnetic coils were simplified to line segments , and the biot - savart law was then used to generate the magnetic field and its taylor expansion .",
    "we could thus ensure that in our case no important third- or higher - order terms are neglected in the monte - carlo model if one uses the magnetic field magnitude from approximation eq .",
    "[ ipfield ] . for the thomas - fermi model",
    "we use eq .",
    "[ ipfield ] to derive the local magnetic field curvatures  which vary slightly with the centre - of - mass position of the bec during the bounce pulses .    in the monte - carlo simulation",
    "the condensate maintains an approximately thomas - fermi distribution ( eq .",
    "[ tf2d ] ) in the @xmath129 imaging plane throughout the bouncing sequence .",
    "however , due to the @xmath94 term in the magnetic potential , the distribution is rotated in the @xmath94 plane by an angle @xmath130 ( or @xmath131 in the @xmath129 plane ) . in order to find the radii , and tilt angle @xmath132 of the monte - carlo distribution , the cartesian co - ordinates of the @xmath133 monte - carlo ` atoms ' are projected into the @xmath129 plane with co - ordinates @xmath134",
    "it can be shown that given the moments of the cloud in the @xmath129 plane @xmath135 one obtains the rotation angle of the cloud : @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the rms ` radii ' of the cloud in the non - rotated @xmath129 frame . additionally , in the @xmath129 frame rotated by @xmath132 the true rms radii of the condensate are given by @xmath139 @xmath140 and one can show that these rms radii can be converted to thomas - fermi distribution maximum radii by multiplying by a factor of @xmath141    the theoretical models work well @xcite in describing the absorption images taken from our current viewing angle , but they also show that even more interesting behaviour should be seen in the @xmath142 plane .",
    "when @xmath143 g ( i.e. @xmath144 ) then after the first bounce the condensate comes to a tight focus in the @xmath92 direction . the thomas - fermi model ( fig .",
    "[ theory2 ] ) , with its inclusion of atomic interactions but neglect of anharmonic spatial magnetic fields , predicts a very tight focus with an @xmath92 cloud maximum radius of @xmath145 nm . the de broglie wavelength of the bec at the focus , @xmath146 nm , can be obtained from its velocity .",
    "thus , if a suitably harmonic mirror is used and the focused matter wave has a transverse width smaller than the matter wavelength , one may expect to see atomic diffraction during the focus .",
    "we now compare the thomas fermi model with three versions of the monte - carlo model .",
    "the monte - carlo models use : the full magnetic potential originating from eq .",
    "[ ipfield ] ( mc ) , the local harmonic approximation to the magnetic potential at the centre of mass ( mc@xmath147 ) , and the harmonic mc@xmath147 model with the inclusion of the effects of the @xmath148 local potential aberration term ( mc@xmath149 ) .",
    "we note that the mc@xmath147 model and thomas - fermi model are identical during the initial condensate expansion @xmath150 and it is only during focusing - if the density is large enough for interatomic repulsion to be important - that the models may differ .    in fig .",
    "[ xyfoc ] we look at the behaviour of the foci in the @xmath142 plane as predicted by the various monte carlo models .",
    "we find that the mc model has a maximum density of @xmath151 in a ` bow - tie ' shaped focus which varies location with time .",
    "the mc@xmath147 model has an extremely tight elliptical focus , leading to a peak density of @xmath152  this density is more than ten times higher than the thomas - fermi model in which interatomic repulsion limits the density at the condensate focus .",
    "the mc@xmath149 model has a similar ( but crisper ) focal shape and a similar maximum density @xmath153 to the mc model  this illustrates that the ` bow - tie ' focus is mainly generated by the @xmath148 terms in the magnetic potential from eq .",
    "[ ipfield ] .",
    "the approximate ( fwhm ) temporal duration of the above monte carlo density maxima during the focus is @xmath154 for the mc , mc@xmath155 and mc@xmath149 models respectively .",
    "this can be compared to the @xmath156 duration of the focus seen in the thomas - fermi model .",
    "in addition , the foci of the monte carlo models occur approximately @xmath156 before the thomas - fermi focus , as interatomic repulsion delays the focal time .",
    "the thomas - fermi model thus predicts very tight foci in the @xmath142 plane , however the anharmonicities of our present mirror mean that our monte - carlo model will be better at predicting the shape of the @xmath142 focus .",
    "the monte - carlo models neglection of the interatomic repulsion which is included in the thomas - fermi model , also appears to be invalid , as the mc@xmath147 model differs dramatically from the thomas - fermi model at the focus . during the focus very high densities",
    "are obtained , but only for a very short duration compared to the time over which interatomic repulsion is important during the initial condensate expansion @xmath157 as can be seen in fig .  [ theory2 ] ) .",
    "thus although we might expect the mc models to break down during the focus , the expansion trajectory of the condensate after the focus may well be valid .",
    "when we begin probing such extremely small length scales in the @xmath142 plane ( nanometres  rather than the @xmath158 diffraction - limited resolutions of present bec imaging systems ) , both of the simple theories described here - the thomas - fermi and monte - carlo models - will therefore cease to be valid .",
    "these experiments will need to be compared to calculations using the more complicated time - dependent 3d gross - pitaevskii equation , however it is worth noting that the thomas - fermi model should be adequate if a sufficiently harmonic magnetic mirror is employed , and the monte carlo model may well suffice for describing condensate behaviour prior to and immediately after focusing if the tightness of the focus does not induce atomic matter - wave diffraction .",
    "in conclusion , we have created a relatively simple and robust bec apparatus . with this apparatus we have demonstrated adjustable focusing and reflection of a bec from a soft , extremely smooth , and adaptive temporal magnetic mirror .",
    "if highly parabolic magnetic mirrors of this type are used , this technology should enable one to focus atoms down to nanoscales . in order to investigate such focusing",
    ", we plan to image the condensates in the @xmath142 plane in future , with the hope of observing atomic matter - wave diffraction .",
    "highly parabolic mirrors can also create extremely cold , collimated atomic beams for use in atomic clocks and we have already demonstrated a rudimentary matter - wave ` beam expander ' in this vein @xcite .",

    "<S> we report adjustable magnetic ` bouncing ' and focusing of a dilute @xmath0rb bose gas . </S>",
    "<S> both the condensate production and manipulation are realised using a particularly straight - forward apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> the bouncing region is comprised of approximately concentric ellipsoidal magnetic equipotentials with a centre that can be adjusted vertically . </S>",
    "<S> we extend , and discuss the limitations of , simple thomas - fermi and monte - carlo theoretical models for the bouncing , which at present find close agreement with the condensate s evolution . </S>",
    "<S> very strong focusing has been inferred and the observation of atomic matter - wave diffraction should be possible . </S>",
    "<S> prospects look bright for applications in matter - wave atom - optics , due to the very smooth nature of the mirror . </S>"
