    "the new generation of facilities are used to investigate the proton- and neutron - rich nuclei with the radioactive isotope beam .",
    "such as , the scientists discovered @xmath8 new neutron - rich nuclei on radioactive isotope beam factory in 2010  @xcite .",
    "one of the important issue in nuclear physics is to understand the nuclei from the stability line to the drip line .",
    "thanks to the extensive experimental and theoretical study on the properties of proton- and neutron - rich nuclei in recent years , the position of the drip line is known up to oxygen isotopes  @xcite .    in a theoretical view , how to solve the nuclear system is a long standing big challenge .",
    "the common theoretical methods are roughly divided into three categories : the _ ab initio _ methods , the methods based on the mean field approximation , and the nuclear shell model  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear shell model solves the many - body schrodinger equation in a truncated model space .",
    "the modern nuclear shell model includes the configuration mixing and the residue interactions .",
    "the binding energies and the wave functions of both the ground and excited states can be given simultaneously after the diagonalization process .",
    "the observed binding energies , levels , electromagnetic properties , @xmath9 decays , and many other properties can be well describe through shell model approach in light and medium mass region  @xcite .    for light nuclei in @xmath5 region ,",
    "some well determined shell - model hamiltonians are constructed by fitting to the observed binding energies and levels , such as mk  @xcite , wbt and wbp  @xcite .",
    "the fitting procedure of these hamiltonians is limited in the @xmath10 model space and considers the strength of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 parts of the interaction .",
    "the two - nucleon excitation from @xmath0 to @xmath1 shell and the corresponding @xmath6 interaction are not included in the construction of the hamiltonians .",
    "recently , a new hamiltonian for @xmath5 shell , ysox , is introduced  @xcite .",
    "ysox well describes the binding energies , levels , electromagnetic properties , and gamow - teller transitions of boron , carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen isotopes  @xcite .",
    "the construction of the ysox includes the consideration of the @xmath6 interaction , which allows an investigation on the two - nucleon excitation from the @xmath0 to @xmath1 shell .",
    "the percentage of the @xmath4 configuration dramatically decreases from @xmath14o to @xmath15o , which indicates its importance in the description of nuclei from the stability line to the drip line  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to understand such changes on the isospin degree of freedom .",
    "the main configuration @xmath14o fully occupies the @xmath0 shell in the independent particle model ( ipm ) . after the inclusion of the residue interaction ,",
    "the ground state of @xmath14o shows strong mixing between the @xmath16 and @xmath4 configurations . actually , the higher @xmath17 configuration is also important for the exactly description of @xmath14o  @xcite . from @xmath14o to @xmath15o ,",
    "the valence neutrons in @xmath1 shell increase .",
    "the mixing between the @xmath16 and @xmath4 configurations contribute less in the total energies .",
    "the two - nucleon excitation shows its effect on the degree of freedom of excitation energy . in @xmath18b and @xmath19c ,",
    "levels of some excited states are strongly affected by the strength of the @xmath6 interaction , but others are almost independent on that interaction .",
    "the present work investigate how and why the @xmath4 configuration influence the levels in @xmath2c and @xmath3c in the frame work of shell model .",
    "modern shell model includes the residue two - body interactions and treats the states of nuclei as the configuration mixing of all possible states . in principle",
    ", the energies and wave functions can be obtained through solving the schrodinger equation .",
    "but for the majority of nuclei with many protons and neutrons , the model space is too huge .",
    "one can limit the cost of the calculations by selecting a core , normally a doubly magic nuclei .",
    "the model space is then reduced to several valence proton and neutron orbits .",
    "the energies and wave functions can be obtained by solving the schrodinger equation in the truncated model space .",
    "because the model space is reduced to the effective model space , a corresponding effective hamiltonian is needed to be used when solving the schrodinger equation .",
    "effective hamiltonian is normally derived from nucleon - nucleon potential in two ways , one is phenomenological by fitting the nucleon - nucleon potential to the experimental binding energies and energy levels , the other is realistic by using nucleon - nucleon potential derived from the pion - nucleon scattering and the nucleon - nucleon scattering data .    in this paper ,",
    "the effective model space is @xmath5 space , and corresponding effective hamiltonians are mk  @xcite , wbt  @xcite , wbp  @xcite , and recently suggested ysox  @xcite .",
    "these phenomenological hamiltonians fit their two - body matrix elements ( tbme ) to the nuclear structure data , especially the binding energies and energy levels .",
    "shell - model calculations are forwarded through the programme oxbash  @xcite .",
    "the new hamiltonian for @xmath5 region ysox  @xcite is developed from @xmath20  @xcite , sfo  @xcite and sdpf - m  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 parts of tbme are from sfo and sdpf - m , respectively .",
    "the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) tbme are calculated through @xmath20  @xcite plus m3y  @xcite spin - orbit force as follows , @xmath25 the @xmath26 is the original @xmath20 . in the present study",
    ", we reduce the central force in tbme in @xmath23 and @xmath27 by factors @xmath28 and @xmath29 from the original @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "the percentage of @xmath4 configuration changes in each isotope when neutron number increasing , such as , from @xmath30 in @xmath14o to @xmath31 in @xmath15o  @xcite .",
    "it may also change from ground to excited states .",
    "@xcite discussed the effect of the @xmath6 interaction on the energy levels of @xmath18b and @xmath19c .",
    "the @xmath6 interaction is the interaction between @xmath7 and @xmath4 configuration .",
    "if the excited state has the similar @xmath4 configuration to the ground state , the strength of @xmath6 interaction rarely affect the excitation energy , and vice versa . but both in @xmath18b and @xmath19c , the excitation energies of some states changes a lot when the strength of @xmath6 interaction changes .",
    "such results indicate the percentage of @xmath4 configuration in these excited states are different from those of the ground states .",
    "it is interesting to see that some low lying states in @xmath18b has relatively large @xmath4 configuration .",
    "although the valence nucleons of @xmath18b are mainly active in the @xmath0 shell , the @xmath32 state has @xmath33 @xmath4 configuration , around @xmath31 larger than that of the ground state .",
    "the previous investigations show that the mixing of @xmath7 and @xmath4 configuration is important in the description of both ground and excited states in both stable and exotic nuclei .",
    "the present work aims to extend the knowledge on the effect of the two - nucleon excitation from @xmath0 shell to @xmath1 shell .",
    "[ 12c ] and  [ 14c ] present the levels of @xmath2c and @xmath3c as the function of the strength of the @xmath6 interaction . as discussed before , if the excited states have similar @xmath4 configuration to the ground state , the excitation energies do not change much when the @xmath6 interaction changes . in fig .",
    "[ 12c ] , it is seen that the levels of @xmath2c changes little as the @xmath6 interaction increasing or decreasing .",
    "but for @xmath3c , the excitation energies of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 states are dramatically dependent on the @xmath6 interaction .    to further investigate the @xmath4 configuration in different states of @xmath2c and @xmath3c , the percentage of both @xmath7 and @xmath4 configuration are presented in fig .  [ per ]",
    "it is clear seen that the @xmath4 configuration is almost the same in each states of @xmath2c , but very different in those of @xmath3c .",
    "the valence nucleons of @xmath2c are mostly excited inside @xmath0 shell .",
    "the two - nucleon excitation from @xmath0 to @xmath1 shell is around @xmath31 in each state and does not change the level of @xmath2c much . in @xmath3c ,",
    "the most important configuration for ground state is @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38 is mainly excited by one protons moving to @xmath39 orbit , which does not increase or decrease the @xmath4 configuration compared with that of ground state .",
    "but for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , they are mainly excited by moving two neutrons to @xmath1 shell , rather than two protons to @xmath39 orbit .",
    "the @xmath4 configuration becomes the most important configuration ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the @xmath36 is all contributed by @xmath4 configuration . because the two proton holes in @xmath0 shell can not couple to the angular momentum @xmath41 .    as a results of the @xmath4 configuration in each state ,",
    "the levels are affected by the @xmath6 interaction .",
    "when the strength of the @xmath6 interaction is increasing , the ground state , @xmath38 , and @xmath32 states are more binding because of the @xmath4 configuration around @xmath42 .",
    "but for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 states , they are ( almost ) purely @xmath4 configuration .",
    "therefor their binding energies are rarely dependent on the strength of the @xmath6 interaction , resulting a changing level relative to ground state .",
    "the present work discuss the two - nucleon excitation from @xmath0 to @xmath1 shell in light nuclei based on the framework of shell model .",
    "the @xmath4 configuration is important in the investigation of binding energy in a long isotope chain and in the different states in one nucleus .",
    "the relationship between the strength of the @xmath6 interaction and the levels of @xmath2c and @xmath3c are researched through hamiltonian ysox .",
    "it is shown that the strength of the @xmath6 interaction is very influential to the levels of states with different @xmath4 configuration from that of the ground state .",
    "the strength of such interaction linked the @xmath7 and @xmath4 configuration is rarely investigated because its effect is not obvious in the levels of many nuclei .",
    "it is interesting to further find the nuclei of which the level is sensitive to the strength of the @xmath6 interaction , which is helpful for the understanding how the nuclear force driving the nuclear structure .",
