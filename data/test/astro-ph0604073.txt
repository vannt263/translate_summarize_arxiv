    "major progress in submillimeter cosmology has been seen since the commissioning of scuba ( submillimetre common - user bolometer array ; holland et al . 1999 ) , which was mounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "many studies have been undertaken studying submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) in large blank field surveys and surveys of strongly lensing galaxy clusters . in the cluster surveys the gravitational lensing moves the confusion limit to flux levels fainter than the blank field limit of 2 mjy .",
    "it has taken several years to overcome the many complications involved in the identification of the counterparts .",
    "the large beam of 15@xmath4 in diameter makes unique identifications difficult .",
    "however , resorting to multiwavelength follow - up ranging from radio to optical it is possible to constrain the properties of the underlying galaxy , including ( photometric ) redshift and the presence of agn .",
    "( for more details , see smail 2006 , this volume . )",
    "recently , chapman et al . ( 2003 , 2005 ) published a large spectroscopic survey of radio - detected bright smgs ( @xmath5mjy ) .",
    "they presented redshifts for about 70 smgs from several blank field surveys  an effort , which has been crucial for quantifying the properties of the bright smgs ( see smail 2006 ) .",
    "the redshift distribution has a median redshift of  2.4 .",
    "even though using radio observations to determine the position of the underlying galaxy is a very efficient identification technique , it is likely biased towards redshifts @xmath6",
    ". there are candidate counterparts towards higher redshifts ( e.g.  dunlop et al . , 2004 ) , however , their redshifts still need to be confirmed spectroscopically .",
    "we here present details and spectroscopy for a redshift 4 counterpart .",
    "m scuba contours at @xmath7 .",
    "the white box indicate position of smmj16359 + 66130 and of the sub - image shown in fig .",
    "the three bright sources south of the box are the triple - imaged galaxies smmj16359 + 6612 ( kneib et al . , 2004a ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] , width=415 ]",
    "source , smmj16359 + 66130 , with scuba contours overlayed ( black show 850@xmath8 m and grey 450@xmath8 m ) .",
    "the two solid lines indicate the extent of the galaxy , which corrected for lensing corresponds to a physical scale of 6.2kpc@xmath92.8kpc .",
    "the largest knot has a scale corresponding to @xmath00.5kpc .",
    "[ fig2],width=245 ]    .7 cm    deep scuba maps at both 850@xmath8 m and 450@xmath8 m have been obtained of the cluster field abell2218 ( knudsen et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "nine sources were detected , four of these having 850-fluxes around 10 mjy ; an optical image with the scuba contours is shown in fig .",
    "three of these bright sources were identified as a multiply imaged background galaxy at @xmath10 ( smmj16359 + 6612 ; kneib et al . , 2004a ) .",
    "it is for the fourth of the bright sources , smmj16359 + 66130 , that we here propose the identification ( knudsen , kneib & egami , 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "smmj16359 + 66130 is detected both at 850@xmath8 m and 450@xmath8 m with fluxes of 11 mjy and 20 mjy , respectively .",
    "the lensing magnification of the source is about 4.5 .",
    "the low flux ratio @xmath11 is strongly suggestive of this smg being at redshift @xmath12 .",
    "it is not detected in the radio maps at 1.4 ghz and 8.2 ghz from garrett et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which supports that this is a high redshift source , @xmath13 .    in the optical and near - infrared images",
    "there is only one galaxy within a search radius of 8@xmath4 from the submm position , which is at very high redshift .",
    "it is indicated in the optical hst acs f850lp @xmath14image ( kneib et al . , 2004b ) in fig .",
    "the position is ra , dec(j2000 ) = 16:35:55.66,+66:12:59.5 and it has a magnitude of @xmath15mag and of @xmath16mag , though is undetected in the deep wfpc2 f606w and f450w images from smail et al .",
    "we have obtained optical spectroscopy for this source using lris on keck . in the spectrum , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we identify one emission line .",
    "the line appears to be asymmetric and with a lower continuum level on the blue side .",
    "we propose that this is ly@xmath17 , which implies a redshift of @xmath18 .",
    "smmj16359 + 66130 is detected at both in the optical and at near - infrared wavelengths , including the _ spitzer _ irac images of a2218 ( egami et al . , 2005 ) , where the fluxes are @xmath19@xmath8jy and @xmath20@xmath8jy .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the spectral energy distribution .",
    "the star formation rate is about 600m@xmath1yr@xmath2 as estimated from the scuba detection .",
    "there is no indication of the presence of a strong agn .",
    "; this implies a redshift @xmath21 .",
    "[ fig3 ] , width=302 ]      even though the unlensed submm flux is slightly fainter compared to the sample of chapman et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) , the properties of smmj16359 + 66130 are similar to those of the radio - selected identifications of the chapman et al . sample .",
    "there are no signs of a strong , dominant agn , and so likely the dominant heating mechanism is star formation .",
    "additionally , ly@xmath17 is seen in emission .",
    "hence smmj16359 + 66130 is likely similar to many sources in the chapman et al .  sample .",
    "the high redshift of smmj16359 + 66130 extends the redshift distribution of smgs as established by chapman et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) . while the highest redshift identification in the sample of chapman et al . is 3.6 , they present models for the redshift distribution indicating that less than 10% of the smgs would lie beyond that . for the current smg samples of a total of a few hundred sources",
