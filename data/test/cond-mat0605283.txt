    "matter - wave solitons , that can be created in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , are a research subject of great interest , both as nonlinear collective excitations in macroscopic quantum matter , and due to the potential they offer in applications to high - precision interferometry , atomic - wave soliton lasers , quantum information processing , and other emerging technologies .",
    "dark and bright matter - wave solitons were experimentally created in nearly one - dimensional ( 1d ) trap configurations @xcite , filled with @xmath1rb and @xmath2li condensate , respectively . in these settings ,",
    "strong radial confinement freezes transverse dynamics of the condensate , keeping atoms ( with mass @xmath3 ) in the ground state of the corresponding 2d harmonic - oscillator potential , @xmath4 , while a weak axial parabolic trap , @xmath5 , allows quasi - free motion of the soliton in the axial direction , @xmath6 .",
    "new recent experiments with @xmath7rb @xcite and related numerical simulations @xcite have showed the existence of stable solitary waves in a weakly elongated ( @xmath8 ) trap . these essentially three - dimensional ( 3d ) bright solitons exhibit",
    "rich and complex behavior , not present in their nearly-1d counterparts .",
    "notable among the new features , are inelastic collisions between solitons , which are strongly sensitive to phase relations between them and their relative speed .    adding a periodic optical - lattice ( ol ) potential in the axial direction of the quasi-1d trap",
    "makes it possible to create bright matter - wave solitons of the gap type in repulsive condensates @xcite , which is a particular manifestation of very rich physics of bec trapped in ols , as reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , 2d and 3d localized states in the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe , which is the basic mean - field bec model ) , that may be sustained and stabilized by cellular potentials , i.e. , multidimensional ols , have attracted a great deal of interest , see review @xcite .",
    "a great challenge to the experiment is creation of multidimensional matter - wave solitons , as well as the making of spatiotemporal solitons in nonlinear optics @xcite . in particular , multi - dimensional solitons trapped in a low - dimensional ol ( i.e. , 1d lattice in the 2d space @xcite , and 2d lattice in the 3d space @xcite ) , have been predicted @xcite .",
    "as these solitons keep their mobility in the free direction , the latter settings can be used to test head - on and tangential collisions between solitons .",
    "note that the quasi-1d lattice potential can not stabilize 3d solitons @xcite ( this becomes possible if the quasi-1d lattice is combined with the periodic time modulation of the nonlinearity provided by the feshbach - resonance - management technique @xcite ; a general account of the technique of periodic management for solitons can be found in book @xcite ) .",
    "the low - dimensional ol can also be implemented as a radial ( axially symmetric ) lattice in both 2d @xcite-@xcite and 3d @xcite settings . in both cases , stable solitons in the self - attractive medium",
    "were predicted , in the form of a spot trapped either at the central potential well , or ( in the 2d case ) in a radial potential trough ( additionally , the so - called azimuthons were predicted as azimuthally periodic deformations of vortices in the uniform 2d medium @xcite ; however , they are unstable in the case of the cubic nonlinearity ) . in the latter case , the spot - shaped soliton may run at a constant angular velocity in the trough ( thus being a _ rotary soliton _",
    "the circular motion may be more convenient for the experimental study of mobility and collisions of matter - wave solitons ( and soliton trains ) than the already realized soliton - supporting settings in the cigar - shaped traps @xcite , as in the circular geometry the motion is not affected by the weak longitudinal trap .",
    "this setting is also convenient for studies of patterns in self - repulsive becs . in particular ,",
    "dark solitons were , thus far , created in cigar - shaped traps @xcite , where the background density is essentially non - uniform , as it vanishes at edges of the trap . in a circular trough ,",
    "pairs of dark solitons can be created without this complication .",
    "in fact , both axisymmetric ( azimuthally uniform ) vortices @xcite and dipole and quadrupole states , that may be regarded as stable complexes of two or four dark solitons @xcite , were predicted in the two - dimensional gpe with the repulsive nonlinearity and bessel - lattice radial potential .",
    "the stable dipole and quadrupole patterns may also rotate at a constant angular velocity @xcite .",
    "radial potentials in the form of @xmath9 or @xmath10 , adopted in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 are positive constants , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the bessel functions ) , can support patterns of most types considered in those works in the linear limit of the model . indeed , axisymmetric states trapped in the central potential well , as well as azimuthally uniform vortices and dipolar and quadrupolar modes trapped in circular potential troughs , may be found as 2d eigenstates of the quantum - mechanical linear schrdinger equation in such radial potentials .",
    "accordingly , nonlinear states with the same symmetries found in refs .",
    "@xcite may be considered as continuations of their linear counterparts .",
    "an exception is the spot - shaped soliton in a circular trough ( the one that can perform rotary motion along the trough , as mentioned above ) . on the contrary to that , in this paper we report results for the _ radially periodic _ ol potential , @xmath15 , which , obviously , can not support any radially localized state in the linear limit .",
    "therefore , all localized patterns reported in this paper are essentially nonlinear objects , and they may be different from their counterparts found in the bessel lattices , as concerns their existence and stability conditions . the solitons that we report in this work may be categorized as solitons of the ordinary type in the model with self - attraction , and _ radial gap solitons _",
    "( a new species of solitary waves ) , in the case of self - repulsion .",
    "note that solitons of the gap type can not exist in the above - mentioned bessel - lattice potentials .",
    "as for the attractive model , a somewhat similar problem was considered in refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite , where it was demonstrated that the self - attractive nonlinearity in the 1d and 2d geometry ( the latter setting is axisymmetric ) can turn a quasi - bound state in a potential well dug on top of a potential hill into a true bound state ( including 2d vortices @xcite ) . in the 3d setting , the situation is more complicated , but a similar effect is also possible @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to mention that , besides the attractive or repulsive cubic nonlinearity , the radial - lattice potential can also be combined with the self - focusing saturable nonlinearity , characteristic of photorefractive media . it was predicted @xcite and very recently experimentally demonstrated @xcite that stable solitons are possible in this case too ( in fact , ref .",
    "@xcite presents the first ever experimental realization of solitons in any radial lattice ) .",
    "another very recent experimental result is the observation of light localization , in the form of spot - like and ring - like patterns , in a photorefractive medium equipped with a third - order bessel lattice subjected to azimuthal modulation , which corresponds to a combination of saturable nonlinearity and an effective potential @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the angular coordinate @xcite .",
    "a different experimental setup that also leads to a ring - shaped trap for the bec has been recently reported , based on a specially designed configuration of the external magnetic field that creates a guide for matter waves in the form of a torus @xcite . in parallel , nearly-1d solitons in toroidal traps loaded with self - attractive bec were studied theoretically @xcite ( in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , the condensate was self - repulsive ) .",
    "the objective of this paper is to investigate various types of matter - wave solitons supported by the periodic radial lattice potential .",
    "it should be mentioned that , besides the bec context , the model and results obtained in it may also be relevant to photonic - crystal fibers with a concentric ( rather than usual hexagonal ) structure , similar to that in fibers with the multilayer cladding @xcite . in that case",
    ", the soliton will be a self - trapped beam propagating in the fiber .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we formulate the model based on the respective two - dimensional gpe .",
    "section iii is dealing with solitons trapped in the center ( including the radial gap solitons , in the case of the model with repulsion ) , for which results are obtained by means of the variational approximation ( va ; both static and dynamical variants of the va are presented ) , and in direct simulations .",
    "section iv treats solitons trapped in annular channels ( potential troughs ) . by means of the va ,",
    "we derive an effective 1d equation for the attractive model , which predicts a possibility of the existence of stable axisymmetric ring - shaped states , and the onset of their instability against azimuthal modulations at a finite density .",
    "exact modulated ( cnoidal - wave ) solutions , which appear above the instability threshold of the uniform state , are found too , as well as exact solutions for azimuthal solitons .",
    "direct numerical simulations corroborate the existence of stable uniform and modulated ring - shaped patterns , and reveal the radial gap solitons whose central love is trapped in the annular trough ( in the repulsive version of the model ) .",
    "also reported are stable ring - shaped gap solitons carrying a pair of dark solitons on their crests .",
    "section v addresses dynamics of moving two - dimensional solitons , trapped in the circular troughs of the attractive model .",
    "it is shown that the slow solitons are stable , while fast ones are destroyed due to leakage of matter into the outer trough , under the action of the centrifugal force .",
    "head - on collisions between in - phase solitons lead to collapse ( intrinsic blow - up ) , while @xmath0-out - of - phase solitons collide many times , and eventually merge into a single soliton ( without collapsing ) ; the same happens with in - phase solitons colliding tangentially , as they are trapped in adjacent troughs .",
