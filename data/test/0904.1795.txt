    "while the earth s magnetism has been studied for centuries starting with the first scientific monograph of gilbert ( 1600 ) , the question of the magnetism of other planets had received scant attention until recently because of the lack of relevant observations . only in 1955 clear evidence for the existence of a planetary magnetic field other than the geomagnetic one",
    "was obtained through the observation of the jovian decametric radio waves ( burke and franklin , 1955 ) . since it had been more or less accepted until the end of the 19-th century that geomagnetism arises from the remnant magnetization of the earth similar properties may have been assumed for the other terrestrial planets and the moon",
    "this view lost its appeal , however , when it became evident that the curie - temperature is exceeded in the earth below a depth of about 30 km .",
    "ferromagnetic materials in the earth s crust could thus explain only magnetic fields with a relatively short wavelength .    the current period of intense research on the magnetism of planets other than that of the earth started with the first detailed measurement of jupiter s magnetic field by the pioneer 10 space probe in 1973 and the discovery of mercury s magnetism by mariner 10 in 1974 . in the early seventies also",
    "the development of the theory of magnetohydrodynamic dynamos had started in which the reaction of the lorentz force of the generated magnetic field is taken into account in physically realistic configurations ( childress and soward , 1972 ; busse , 1973 ; soward , 1974 ) . until that time",
    "dynamo theoreticians had focused their attention on the kinematic problem in which the possibility of growing magnetic fields driven by somewhat arbitrarily chosen velocity fields is considered .",
    "it must be remembered that only a few years earlier it had been demonstrated by backus ( 1958 ) and herzenberg ( 1958 ) in a mathematically convincing way that the homogeneous dynamo process of the generation of magnetic fields in a singly connected domain of an electrically conducting fluid is indeed possible .",
    "doubts about the feasibility of this process which had first been proposed by larmor ( 1919 ) had persisted after cowling ( 1934 ) had proved that purely axisymmetric fields could not be generated in this way .",
    "the complexity of the magnetohydrodynamic dynamo problem described by the nonlinearly coupled navier - stokes equations and the equation of magnetic induction had prevented progress in understanding planetary dynamos through analytical solutions . only the advent of powerful enough computers in the 1990-ies has allowed to solve numerically the coupled three - dimensional partial differential equations through forward integration in time . even today and for the foreseeable future the limits of computer capacity will permit the exploration of only a small fraction of the parameter space of interest for the understanding of planetary dynamos .    in view of the difficulties of a rigorous theory of planetary dynamos ,",
    "many attempts have been made to obtain simple similarity relationships which would fit the observed planetary magnetic moments as function of certain properties of the planets .",
    "some early proponents have gone as far as claiming the existence of a `` magnetic bode s law '' corresponding to a relationship between the magnetic moment and size or angular momentum of a planet in analogy to the titius - bode law for the radii of the orbits of the planets .",
    "just as in the latter case , however , attempts to derive a magnetic bode s law from basic physical principles have failed .",
    "other proposals have taken into account physical forces .",
    "since a common ingredient of planetary dynamos is the existence of a fluid part of the core with a sufficiently high electrical conductivity the latter parameter together with the core radius and the angular velocity of the planetary rotation usually enter the similarity relationships such as those proposed by hide ( 1974 ) , busse ( 1976 ) , jacobs ( 1979 ) and dolginov ( 1977 ) .",
    "malkus ( 1968 , 1996 ) has argued for the precession of the earth as the cause of geomagnetism and he and vanyo ( 1984 ) have demonstrated through laboratory experiments that precession and tides may cause turbulent motions in fluid planetary cores .",
    "dolginov ( 1977 ) proposed a scaling law for the precessional origin of all planetary magnetic fields . while a dynamo driven by turbulent flows caused by precession and tides can not be easily excluded in the case of the earth ( tilgner , 2005 ) , it is much less likely in the case of other planets such as uranus for which precessional torques are rather minute . just as a common precessional origin of planetary magnetism",
    "is not regarded as feasible , so have all other proposed similarity relationships lost in appeal and are no longer seriously considered .",
    "we shall return , however , to scaling relationships based more directly on the basic equations in section 6 .",
    "since the proposal of the geodynamo as the cause of the earth s magnetism had been in doubt for a long time before 1958 , numerous alternative proposals had been made in the literature . among these",
    "only the possibility that thermoelectric currents may generate a planetary magnetic field is still discussed in the case of mercury ( stevenson , 1987 ; giampieri and balogh , 2002 ) . for a discussion of the failings of the various proposals for non - dynamo origins of planetary magnetic fields we refer to the papers of bullard ( 1949 ) and stevenson ( 1983 ) .",
    "although the dynamo hypothesis of the origin of planetary magnetism is not without difficulties , it is the only one considered seriously at the present time with the possible exception of the just mentioned case of mercury .    dynamos generally convert mechanical energy into magnetic one .",
    "in contrast to the technical dynamo which is characterized by a multiply connected region of high electrical conductivity , i.e. it depends on an appropriate wiring , planetary dynamos are referred to as homogeneous dynamos since they operate in a singly connected domain of high electrical conductivity .",
    "since flows in planetary cores with active dynamos are usually turbulent the small scale structure of the magnetic field is correspondingly chaotic .",
    "the large scale structure , however , can be quite regular .",
    "one distinguishes `` steady '' and oscillatory dynamos .",
    "the most famous example of the latter kind is the solar dynamo which exhibits a well defined period of about 22 years .",
    "the geodynamo , on the other hand , is a `` steady '' dynamo , even though it varies in its amplitude by a factor of two or more on the magnetic diffusion time scale and reverses its polarity on a longer time scale .",
    "a measure of the magnetic diffusion time is given by the decay time , @xmath0 , of the magnetic field in the absence of fluid motions . here",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 refer to the electrical conductivity and the magnetic permeability of the planetary core of radius @xmath3 . in the case of the earth",
    "the decay time is of the order of 20 000 years , but it may vary between a few hundred and a million years for other examples of planetary dynamos .",
    "the theory of homogeneous dynamos is based on maxwell s equations for the magnetic flux density @xmath4 , the electric current density @xmath5 and the electric field @xmath6 in the magnetohydrodynamic approximation in which the displacement current is neglected .",
    "this approximation is highly accurate as long as the fluid velocity is small compared to the velocity of light which is certainly the case for all planetary applications .",
    "these equations together with ohm s law for a moving conductor are given by    @xmath7    where @xmath2 is the magnetic permeability of the fluid and @xmath1 is its electrical conductivity .",
    "these `` pre - maxwell '' equations have the property that they are invariant with respect to a galilei transformation , i. e. the equations remain unchanged in a new frame of reference moving with the constant velocity vector @xmath8 relative to the original frame of reference . indicating the variables of the new frame by a prime we find    @xmath9    this invariance is the basis for the combination in mhd of equations ( 1 ) with the equations of hydrodynamics in their usual non - relativistic form .",
    "it is remarkable that this invariance does not only hold with respect to a galilei transformation , but with respect to a transformation to a rotating frame of reference as well . in that case",
    "@xmath8 is replaced by @xmath10 in equations ( 2 ) , but when @xmath11 is operating on any vector @xmath12 the term @xmath13 must be added on the right hand side , since even a constant vector field becomes time dependent when seen from a rotating frame unless it is parallel to @xmath14 .",
    "elimination of @xmath6 and @xmath5 from equation ( 1 ) yields the equation of magnetic induction @xmath15 which for a solenoidal velocity field @xmath16 and a constant magnetic diffusivity @xmath17 can be further simplified , @xmath18 this equation has the form of a heat equation with the magnetic field line stretching term on the right hand side acting as a heat source .",
    "this interpretation is especially useful for the dynamo problem . in order that a magnetic field @xmath4 may grow ,",
    "the term on the right hand side of ( 4 ) must overcome the effect of the magnetic diffusion term on the left hand side .",
    "using a typical velocity @xmath19 and a typical length scale @xmath20 , the ratio of the two terms can be estimated by the magnetic reynolds number @xmath21 , @xmath22 only when @xmath21 is of the order one or larger may growing magnetic fields become possible .    in the following",
    "we shall first consider the mathematical formulation of the problem of convection driven dynamos in rotating spherical shells in a simple form in which only the physically most relevant parameters are taken into account . before discussing dynamo solutions in section 5 we shall briefly outline in section 4 properties of convection it",
    "the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "applications to various planets and moons will be considered in section 6 of this article and some concluding remarks are given in section 7 .",
    "a sketch of the geometrical configuration that will be considered is shown in figure 1 .",
    "for the equations describing convection driven dynamos in the frame rotating with the angular velocity @xmath23 we use a standard formulation which has also been used for a dynamo benchmark ( christensen _ et al .",
    "but we assume different scales and assume that a more general static state exists with the temperature distribution @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the ratio of inner to outer radius of the spherical shell and @xmath20 is its thickness .",
    "@xmath26 is the temperature difference between the boundaries in the special case @xmath27 . in the case",
    "@xmath28 the static temperature distribution @xmath29 corresponds to that of a homogeneously heated sphere with the heat source density proportional to the parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the gravity field is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the position vector with respect to the center of the sphere and @xmath33 is its length measured in units of @xmath20 .",
    "in addition to @xmath20 , the time @xmath34 , the temperature @xmath35 and the magnetic flux density @xmath36 are used as scales for the dimensionless description of the problem where @xmath37 denotes the kinematic viscosity of the fluid , @xmath38 its thermal diffusivity and @xmath39 its density .",
    "the boussinesq approximation is used in that @xmath39 is assumed to be constant except in the gravity term where its temperature dependence given by @xmath40 const .",
    "is taken into account .",

    "the prandtl number @xmath48 has been added as an important parameter of the problem even though @xmath53 is often assumed with the argument that all effective diffusivities are equal in turbulent media .",
    "the effective diffusivities of scalar and vector quantities in turbulent fluid flow differ in general , however , and large differences in the corresponding molecular diffusivities will not be erased entirely in the turbulent case .",

    "the numerical integration of equations ( 2 ) together with boundary conditions ( 4 ) proceeds with the pseudo - spectral method as described by tilgner and busse ( 1997 ) and tilgner ( 1999 ) which is based on an expansion of all dependent variables in spherical harmonics for the @xmath78-dependences , i.e. @xmath79 and analogous expressions for the other variables , @xmath80 and @xmath69 .",

    "for an introduction to the problem of convection in spherical shells we refer to the review of busse ( 2002a ) .",
    "convection tends to set in first outside the tangent cylinder in the form of thermal rossby waves for which the coriolis force is balanced almost entirely by the pressure gradient .",
    "the model of the rotating cylindrical annulus has been especially useful for the understanding of this type of convection .",
    "a rough idea of the dependence of the critical rayleigh number @xmath86 for the onset of convection on the parameters of the problem can be gained from the expressions derived from the annulus model ( busse , 1970 )    @xmath87    where @xmath88 refers to the mean radius of the fluid shell , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 to the corresponding colatitude , @xmath91 arcsin @xmath92 .",
    "the azimuthal wavenumber of the preferred mode is denoted by @xmath93 and the corresponding angular velocity of the drift of the convection columns in the prograde direction is given by @xmath94 .    in figure 2",
    "expressions ( 15a , c ) are compared with accurate numerical values which indicate that the general trend is well represented by expressions ( 15a , c ) .",
    "the same property holds for @xmath93 . for a rigorous asymptotic analysis in the case @xmath95 including the radial dependence we refer to jones _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) .",
    "it is evident from figure 2 that the agreement between expressions ( 15 ) and the numerical values deteriorates as low values of @xmath48 are approached .",
    "this behavior is caused by the fact that instead of the thermal rossby wave mode the inertial mode of convection becomes preferred at onset for sufficiently low prandtl numbers .",
    "it is characterized by convection cells attached to the equatorial region of the outer boundary not unlike the `` banana cells '' seen in the narrow gap experiment of figure 3 .",
    "the equatorially attached convection does indeed represent an inertial wave modified by the effects of viscous dissipation and thermal buoyancy .",
    "an analytical description of this type of convection can thus be attained through the introduction of viscous friction and buoyancy as perturbations as has been done by zhang(1994 ) and by busse and simitev ( 2004 ) for stress - free and by zhang ( 1995 ) for no - slip boundaries . according to ardes _",
    "( 1997 ) equatorially attached convection is preferred at onset for @xmath96 where @xmath97 increases in proportion to @xmath98 .    a third form of convection is realized in the polar regions of the shell which comprise the two fluid domains inside the tangent cylinder .",
    "since gravity and rotation vectors are nearly parallel in these regions ( unless values of @xmath25 close to unity are used ) convection resembles the kind realized in a horizontal layer heated from below and rotating about a vertical axis .",
    "because the coriolis force can not be balanced by the pressure gradient in this case , the onset of convection is delayed to higher values of @xmath99 where convection outside the tangent cylinder has reached already high amplitudes . in the case of @xmath75 the onset of convection in the polar regions typically occurs at rayleigh numbers which exceed the critical values @xmath100 for onset of convection outside the tangent cylinder by a factor of the order @xmath101 . except for the case of very low prandtl numbers the retrograde differential rotation in the polar regions generated by convection outside",
    "the tangent cylinder tends to facilitate polar convection by reducing the rotational constraint .",
    "a tendency towards an alignment of convection rolls with the north - south direction ( busse and cuong 1977 ) can be noticed , but this property is superseded by instabilities of the kppers - lortz type ( for an experimental demonstration see busse and heikes ( 1980 ) ) and by interactions with turbulent convection outside the tangent cylinder .",
    "typical features of low and high prandtl number convection are illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "the columnar nature of convection does not vary much with @xmath48 as is evident from the top two plots of the figure . at prandtl numbers of the order unity or less , - but not in the case of inertial convection-",
    ", the convection columns tend to spiral away from the axis and thereby create a reynolds stress which drives a strong geostrophic differential rotation as shown in the bottom left plot of the figure .",
    "this differential rotation in turn promotes the tilt and a feedback loop is thus created . at high values of @xmath48 the reynolds stress becomes negligible and no significant tilt of the convection columns is apparent . in this case",
    "the differential rotation is generated in the form of a thermal wind caused by the latitudinal gradient of the axisymmetric component of @xmath41 .    among the properties of convection at finite amplitudes",
    "the heat transport is the most important one .",
    "customarily its efficiency is measured by the nusselt number which is defined as the heat transport in the presence of convection divided by the heat transport in the absence of motion . in the case of the spherical fluid shell",
    "two nusselt numbers can be defined measuring the efficiency of convection at the inner and the outer boundary , @xmath102 where the double bar indicates the average over the spherical surface .",
    "in addition local nusselt numbers @xmath103 are of interest where only the azimuthal average is applied , as indicated by the single bar , instead of the average over the entire spherical surface .",
    "examples of such measures of the dependence of the heat transport on latitude are shown in figure 5 .",
    "this figure demonstrates that at low supercritical rayleigh numbers the heat transport occurs primarily across the equatorial region , but as @xmath99 increases the heat transport in the polar regions takes off and soon exceeds that at low latitudes .",
    "this process is especially evident at the outer boundary . in the polar regions convection",
    "is better adjusted for carrying heat from the lower boundary to the upper one , and it is known from computations of the convective heat transport in horizontal layers rotating about a vertical axis that the value of @xmath104 may exceed the value in a non - rotating layer at a given value of @xmath99 in spite of the higher critical rayleigh number in the former case ( somerville and lipps , 1973 ) .    outside the tangent cylinder the convective",
    "heat transport encounters unfavorable conditions in that the cylindrical form of the convection eddies is not well adjusted to the spherical boundaries .",
    "this handicap is partly overcome through the onset of time dependence in the form of vacillations in which the convection columns expand and contract in the radial direction or vary in amplitude .    at prandtl numbers of the order unity and less another effect",
    "restricts the heat transport .",
    "the shear of the geostrophic differential rotation created by the reynolds stresses of the convection columns severely inhibits the heat transport . to illustrate this effect",
    "we have plotted in figure 6 in addition to the nusselt numbers the averages of the kinetic energy densities of the various components of the convection flow which are defined by    @xmath105    where the angular brackets indicate the average over the fluid shell and @xmath106 refers to the azimuthally averaged component of @xmath56 , while @xmath107 is defined by @xmath108 .",
    "analogous definitions hold for the energy densities of the magnetic field ,    @xmath109    the total magnetic energy density @xmath110 averaged over the fluid shell is thus given by @xmath111 .",
    "figure 6 is instructive in that it demonstrates both , convection in the presence and in the absence of its dynamo generated magnetic field . as is evident from the right part of figure 6 with @xmath112 relaxation oscillations",
    "occur in which convection sets in nearly periodically for short episodes once the energy @xmath113 of the differential rotation has decayed to a sufficiently low amplitude .",
    "but as soon as convection grows in amplitude , the differential rotation grows as well and shears off the convection columns .",
    "after convection has stopped the differential rotation decays on the viscous time scale until the process repeats itself .",
    "as long as the magnetic field is present @xmath113 is suppressed owing to the action of the lorentz force and high nusselt numbers are obtained .",
    "the dynamo generated magnetic field thus acts in a fashion quite different from that of a homogeneous field which typically counteracts the effects of rotation and tends to minimize the critical value of the rayleigh number when the elsasser number , @xmath114 assumes the value @xmath115 in the case of a plane layer ( chandrasekhar 1961 ) or values of the same order in the case of a sphere ( fearn 1979 ) or in the related annulus problem ( busse 1983 ) .",

    "it appears that dynamos are generated by convection in rotating spherical shells for all parameter values as long as the magnetic reynolds number is of the order @xmath116 or higher and the fluid is not too turbulent .",
    "since @xmath21 can be defined by @xmath117 where the kinetic energy density , @xmath118 , increases with @xmath99 , increasing values of the rayleigh number are required for dynamos as @xmath49 decreases . in planetary cores",
    "the latter parameter may assume values as low as @xmath119 or @xmath120 , but numerical simulation have achieved so far only values somewhat below @xmath121 .",
    "the trend of increasing @xmath99 with decreasing @xmath49 is evident in figure 7 where results are shown for two different values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "it is also evident from the results in the upper left corner of the figure that an increasing @xmath99 may be detrimental for dynamo action .",
    "this is a typical property of marginal dynamos at the boundary of dynamos in the parameter space ( christensen _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 , simitev and busse 2005 ) .",
    "since convection at the relevant values of @xmath99 is chaotic this property also holds for the generated magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic energy must be finite near the boundary of dynamos in the parameter space because a sufficient amplitude of the fluctuating components of the convection flow can be obtained only when the magnetic field is strong enough to suppress the differential rotation .",

    "this symmetry magnetic fields can be generated either with the same symmetry as the convection flow , i.e. @xmath68 and @xmath69 are antisymmetric with respect to equatorial plane in which case one speaks of a quadrupolar dynamo , or the magnetic field exhibits the opposite symmetry with symmetric functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 in which case one speaks of a dipolar dynamo . of special interest",
    "are hemispherical dynamos ( grote and busse 2001 ) in which case the fields of dipolar and quadrupolar symmetry have nearly the same amplitude such that they cancel each other either in the northern or the southern hemisphere .",
    "examples of typical dynamos with different symmetries are shown in figure 8 . here",
    "it is also evident that low @xmath48 and high @xmath48 dynamos differ in the structure of their mean toroidal fields .",
    "while their mean poloidal dipolar fields exhibit hardly any difference , the high @xmath48 dynamo is characterized by strong polar azimuthal flux tubes which are missing in the low @xmath48 case .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the radial gradient of the differential rotation in the polar regions is much stronger for high @xmath48 than for low @xmath48 .",
    "as the rayleigh number increases and polar convection becomes stronger the convection flow looses some of its equatorial symmetry and the magnetic field can no longer easily be classified .",
    "usually the dipolar component becomes more dominant in cases of dynamos which started as either quadrupolar or hemispherical dynamos at lower values of @xmath99 .",
    "it should be emphasized that quadrupolar and hemispherical dynamos are usually oscillatory in that new azimuthal flux tubes of alternating sign emerge in the equatorial plane , move towards higher latitudes , while old flux tubes are dissipated in the polar region .",
    "there also exist dipolar dynamos which exhibit the same type of oscillations .",
    "they are typically found in the parameter space near the region where hemispherical dynamos occur . to illustrate the dynamo oscillations",
    "additional plots separated at equal distances in time before the corresponding plot in the lower three rows of figure 8 are shown in figure 9 .",
    "the four plots in each case cover approximately half a period of oscillation .",
    "it must be realized , of course , that the oscillations are not strictly periodic since they occur in a turbulent system . in this respect",
    "they resemble the solar cycle with its 22 year period . because the solar dynamo is believed to operate at the bottom of the solar convection the propagation of the dynamo wave is towards low latitudes on the sun .",
    "a remarkable feature of the dipole oscillation in figure 9 is that the polar flux tubes hardly change in time .",
    "the oscillation appears to be confined to the region outside the tangent cylinder . at a lower value of @xmath49",
    "the strong polar flux tubes even inhibit the oscillation of the mean poloidal field as shown in figure 10 .",
    "this case has been called the `` invisibly '' oscillating dynamo since at some distance from the boundary of the spherical fluid shell the oscillation of the dynamo can hardly be noticed .",
    "+    the relatively simple magnetic fields displayed in figures 8 , 9 , and 10 should not be regarded as representative for high values of the rayleigh number when @xmath99 exceeds its critical value @xmath100 by an order of magnitude or more . in that case",
    "the equatorial symmetry has nearly disappeared owing to the dominant convection in the polar regions and non - axisymmetric components of the field tend to exceed axisymmetric ones as shown , for example , in figure 11 .",
    "the strong growth with increasing @xmath21 of the non - axisymmetric magnetic flux is also evident in figure 12 when energies corresponding to different values of @xmath49 are compared .    an important question is the average strength of the magnetic field generated by the dynamo process in dependence on the parameters .",
    "two concepts are often used in attempts to answer this question . in astrophysical situations the equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energy is used as a guide .",
    "while such a balance may hold locally as , for example , in the neighborhood of sunspots , it is not likely to be applicable to global planetary magnetic fields . in the earth",
    "s core , for example , the magnetic energy density exceeds the kinetic one by a factor of the order of @xmath122 .",
    "the second concept is based on the property that an elsasser number @xmath123 of the order unity appears to correspond to optimal conditions for convection in rotating systems in the presence of an applied nearly uniform magnetic field .",
    "while this idea may be useful as a first rough estimate , the results of numerical dynamo simulations do not support this concept very well .",
    "the examples shown in figure 12 exhibit @xmath123-values differing by an order of magnitude and even larger variations have been reported by simitev and busse ( 2005 ) and by christensen and aubert ( 2005 ) .",
    "another important feature demonstrated in figure 12 is the change in the structure of the magnetic field with increasing prandtl number . while for @xmath124 and lower values the mean poloidal field is small in comparison with the fluctuating components , this situation changes dramatically at about @xmath125 for @xmath126 such that for higher @xmath48 the mean poloidal field becomes dominant .",
    "usually this field is dipolar .",
    "this change is associated with the transition from the geostrophic differential rotation generated by reynolds stresses to the thermal wind type differential rotation caused by a latitudinal temperature gradient . while the magnetic energy @xmath110 may exceed the total kinetic energy @xmath127 by orders of magnitude in particular for high prandtl numbers , ohmic dissipation is usually found to be at most comparable to viscous dissipation in numerical simulations . but this may be due to the limited numerically accessible parameter space",
    ".    the brief introduction of this section to convection driven dynamos in rotating spherical fluid shells can only give an vague impression of the potential of numerical simulations for the understanding of planetary magnetism .",
    "many more examples of such simulations can be found in the literature .",
    "usually they have been motivated by applications to the geodynamo and @xmath53 is assumed in most cases for simplicity .",

    "in many respects it is too early to model the dynamo process in particular planets .",
    "the numerical simulations of the kind discussed in the preceding sections are still rather removed from the parameter regime relevant to planetary interiors . only most recently attempts have been made to extrapolate results to high rayleigh numbers and high values of @xmath47 ( christensen and aubert , 2006 ) .",
    "moreover , only the most important physical parameters have been taken into account and relevant properties such as compressibility and other deviations from the boussinesq approximation have been considered only in special models applied to the earth s core ( glatzmaier and roberts 1996 ) or to the sun ( brun _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) . on the other hand , many essential parameter values of planetary cores are not sufficiently well known to provide a basis for the development of specific dynamo models .",

    "we have included mars in the table , although it does have an active dynamo at the present time .",
    "the strong magnetization of the martian crust indicates , however , that a strong field dynamo must have operated in the early history of the planet .",
    "the most important question of the theory of planetary magnetism is the dependence of the observed field strength on the properties of the planet .",
    "we have already discussed in the historical introduction various proposals for such dependences based on _ ad hoc _ assumptions , but these have been abandoned by and large .",
    "only the concept of an elsasser number @xmath123 of the order unity is still frequently used .",
    "stevenson ( 2003 ) shows that a value @xmath146 fits most of the planets with a global magnetic field quite well , but in cases such as mercury and saturn only a value of the order @xmath147 can be estimated for @xmath123 . in order to save the concept different dynamo regimes must be assumed .",
    "equilibration balances for weaker magnetic fields have been proposed as , for instance , in the case when the strength of convection is not sufficient to attain the @xmath148 balance .",
    "for details see stevenson ( 1984 ) .",
    "an important balance often invoked in discussions of planetary dynamos ( see , for example , stevenson ( 1979 ) and jones ( 2003 ) ) is the mac - balance ( braginsky 1967 ) where it is assumed that lorentz force , buoyancy force and pressure gradient are all of the same order as the coriolis force , while viscous friction and the momentum advection term are regarded as negligible in the equations of motion .",
    "the neglection of the latter term is well justified for high prandtl numbers , but it is doubtful for values of @xmath48 of the order unity or less .",
    "inspite of their smallness in comparison with the coriolis force , the divergence of the reynolds stress can generate the most easily excitable mode of a rotating fluid , namely the geostrophic differential rotation which can not be driven by the coriolis force , the pressure gradient or buoyancy .",
    "of course , an excitation by the lorentz force is possible in principle .",
    "the latter force , however , usually inhibits the geostrophic differential rotation . since the mean azimuthal component of the magnetic field",
    "is typically created through the shear of the differential rotation , the lorentz force opposes the latter according to lenz rule .",
    "christensen and aubert ( 2006 ) have recently introduced a concept in which the equilibrium strength of planetary magnetism does no longer depend on the rate of rotation @xmath23 , but instead depends only on the available power for driving the dynamo .",
    "they find that scaling laws can be obtained once rayleigh number , nusselt number and dimensionless buoyancy flux @xmath149 have been defined through quantities that no longer involve molecular diffusivities .",
    "this is a surprising result since it requires the presence of rotation and can not be achieved in a non - rotating system .",
    "the final estimate obtained for the strength of the magnetic field in the dynamo region fits the cases of the earth and jupiter quite well , but yields the result that mercury s field could not be generated by a buoyancy driven dynamo since the magnetic reynolds number would be too small . in the cases of the outer planets relevant parameters",
    "are not sufficiently well known to draw definitive conclusions .",
    "finally we like to draw attention to what has been called stevenson s paradox , namely that a too high electrical conductivity is detrimental for dynamo action in planetary cores . according to the wiedemann - franz law of condensed matter physics the thermal conductivity @xmath150 of a metal is proportional to its electrical conductivity times the temperature , @xmath151 , where l has approximately the same value for all metals .",
    "this is due to the fact that in metals electrons dominate both , the transports of heat and of charge . as a consequence",
    "there is an upper bound on the electrical conductivity for which a dynamo driven by thermal convection is possible because a high value of @xmath1 implies a low temperature change with increasing depth needed to carry the heat from the interior of the planetary core .",
    "but as soon as the temperature change with pressure falls below its isentropic value thermal convection disappears and a stably stratified environment is obtained which makes it difficult to drive a dynamo by other types of motions such as compositional convection . ignoring the latter possibility stevenson ( 2003 ) has sketched the diagram shown in figure 13 where the marginal nature of dynamos in terrestrial as well as in the `` icy '' planets is indicated .    in the following brief characterizations of the magnetisms of various planets and moons",
    "are given .",
    "in terrestrial planets and satellites dynamos are possible in the liquid parts of their iron cores .",
    "such cores always include light elements which depress the temperature of freezing and can give rise to compositional buoyancy in the presence of a solidifying inner part of the core . in jupiter and especially in saturn convection may also be driven in part by compositional buoyancy since hydrogen and helium are immiscible in certain regions and helium drops may rain out . in numerical dynamo models",
    "the different sources of buoyancy are usually not distinguished , however .",
    "it has already become apparent that the origin of mercury s magnetism is especially enigmatic . besides the hypothesis of an active dynamo , thermoelectric currents and remnant magnetism of the crust",
    "compete as explanations .",
    "the latter possibility had been discarded for a long time since runcorn s theorem states that a homogeneous spherical shell can not be magnetized by an interior magnetic field in such a way that a dipolar field can be observed from the outside after the interior source has been removed ( runcorn , 1975 ) .",
    "aharonson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have shown , however , that plausible inhomogeneities of the crust could possibly explain a remnant magnetic field created by an ancient dynamo .",
    "the idea that a convection driven dynamo operates in a fluid outer core of mercury has received some support from observations of mercury s librations ( margot et al . , 2004 ) and from numerical simulations ( stanley et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "the amplitudes of the small periodic variations ( librations ) of mercury s rotation caused by the gravitational pull of the sun on the non - axisymmetric mass distribution of mercury appear to be too large for a fully solidified planet .",
    "this suggests that the solid inner core is separated from the mantle by a fluid outer core in which convection flows may occur .",
    "the numerical simulations of dynamos in the thin shell of the outer core have demonstrated that the dipole strength measured from the outside may not be representative for the strength of the magnetic field at the core - mantle boundary and the criteria mentioned above may be satisfied after all .",
    "the question , however , whether there is a sufficiently strong source of buoyancy to sustain convection and the dynamo over the age of the planet has not yet been answered satisfactorily .",
    "space probes have clearly shown that there is no dynamo operating presently in venus .",
    "this result is surprising since venus is very similar to the earth in many other aspects . that the period of rotation is only @xmath152 of a day should not matter much since the coriolis parameter @xmath47 is still huge .",
    "more important is the fact that the cooling of the planet is less efficient because of the apparent absence of mantle convection and plate tectonics .",
    "a solid inner core may not have yet started to grow in venus and vigorous convection does not occur in the core , at least not at the present time .",
    "neither moon nor mars have an active dynamo , but the magnetized rocks in their crusts suggest that in their early history about 4 billion years ago dynamos may have been operating in the iron cores of these bodies . the small lunar core with a radius of the order of 350 km and the age of the magnetized lunar rocks put severe constraints on a possible dynamo origin of lunar magnetism as discussed by stegman et al .",
    "in their model these authors try to accommodate in particular the apparent sudden onset of a lunar dynamo at a time @xmath153 ago . because of its larger iron core the possibility of a temporarily operating martian dynamo is more likely , but the strong magnetization of parts of the martian crust requires a field of at least ten times the strength of the present geomagnetic field . for a recent review of the implications of martian magnetism for the evolution of the planet we refer to stevenson ( 2001 ) .",
    "the jovian magnetic field is rather similar to the geomagnetic one sharing with it a dipole axis that is inclined by an angle of the order of 10 degrees with respect to the axis of rotation . that the higher harmonics of the field are relatively stronger than those in the case of the earth suggest that the jovian dynamo is driven at a more shallow layer than the earth s outer core .",
    "this assumption is in accordance with the transition to metallic hydrogen which is expected to occur at a pressure of @xmath154 corresponding to a region with a radius of 0.9 of the jovian radius ( nellis et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "the transition is not a sharp one as suggested by earlier models of jupiter s interior , but a gradual one leading to a decrease of the magnetic diffusivity down to about @xmath155 .",
    "since this value yields a rather high value for the elsasser number @xmath123 stevenson ( 2003 ) has argued that the dynamo is most active above the region of highest conductivity .",
    "jones ( 2003 ) , on the other hand , accepts the value @xmath156 for @xmath123 , but must admit a high magnetic reynolds number of the order @xmath157 at which an effective dynamo may no longer be possible .",
    "a detailed model of a convection driven jovian dynamo should include effects of compressibility and depth dependent electrical conductivity , but none has yet been published .",
    "saturn s magnetic field with a strength of @xmath158 near the poles is much weaker than that of jupiter which must be attributed primarily to its deeper origin in the planet .",
    "the transition pressure of @xmath159 is reached only at about half the planetary radius .",
    "a property that has received much attention is that the saturnian magnetic field is nearly axisymmetric with respect to the axis of rotation .",
    "this property can not be interpreted as a contradiction to cowling s ( 1934 ) theorem since it has long been shown that fields with arbitrarily small deviations from axisymmetry can be generated by the dynamo process ( braginsky 1976 ) .",
    "stevenson ( 1982 ) gave a reasonable explanation for the almost axisymmetric saturnian field by demonstrating that the differential rotation in the stably stratified , but still electrically conducting gas shells above the dynamo region will tend to shear off all non - axisymmetric components of the field .",
    "the problem may be a bit more intricate as has been pointed out by love ( 2000 ) who showed that sometimes fields with solely non - axisymmetric components are found in such situations .",
    "a metallic liquid probably does not exist in uranus and neptune whose interiors consist mostly of ice and rocks . because of the pressure dissociation of water",
    "deeper regions of these planets are characterized by an ionic conductivity which is lower than typical metallic conductivities by between one and two orders of magnitude .",
    "the mixture of water , methane , ammonia and other ices is sufficiently fluid that convection can occur and that a dynamo is thus possible .",
    "the fact that the observed magnetic field do not show an alignment with the axis planetary rotation and that quadrupolar and octupolar components are comparable to the dipolar components of the fields has been attributed to a dynamo operating in a thin shell ( ruzmaikin and starchenko , 1991 ; stanley and bloxham , 2004 ) .",
    "this seems be hardly necessary , however , since even convection driven dynamos in thick shells often exhibit such fields when small scale components dominate as in the case of high rayleigh numbers and low prandtl numbers .",
    "see , for example , figure 11 which shows a magnetic field rather similar to that of uranus as displayed in the paper of connerney ( 1993 ) .",
    "a special difficulty for a convection driven dynamo in the interior of uranus is caused by its low emission of heat .",
    "holme and bloxham ( 1996 ) suggest that a typical dynamo would involve more ohmic dissipation than corresponds to the heat flux emitted from the interior of the planet .",
    "it came as a great surprise when the measurements of the galileo spacecraft indicated that jupiter s moon ganymede possesses a global magnetic field for which an active dynamo inside the satellite seems to be the only realistic explanation ( kivelson et al . ,",
    "1996 ) , although the possibility of a remnant magnetism can not easily be excluded ( crary and bagenal 1998 ) .",
    "it must be kept in mind that ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system which exceeds even mercury in size .",
    "nevertheless the estimated radius of its iron core is only about 660 km and it is hard believe that it could still be partly molten unless it contain a lot of radioactive potassium 40 or ganymede was captured into a resonance in its more recent history ( showman _ et al .",
    "the fact that ganymede s magnetic moment is nearly aligned with the ambient jovian magnetic has led to the suggestion that the ambient field could aid significantly ganymede s dynamo .",
    "sarson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have investigated this question with the result that the ambient field is too weak to exert much influence . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of io which is much closer to jupiter the interaction between the ambient field and the liquid iron core can explain the observed structure of the magnetic field without the assumption of an active dynamo .",
    "there are no other satellites in the solar system where an active dynamo must be suspected .",
    "the substantial magnetization of many iron meteorites suggest , however , that several differentiated proto - planets have had dynamos in the early days of the solar system .",
    "it is apparent from the above discussions that dynamo theory does not yet have much specific information to contribute to the interpretation of the observed magnetic properties of planets and satellites in the solar system .",
    "even possible interactions between thermal and compositional buoyancies have not yet been taken fully into account ( glatzmaier and roberts 1996 , busse 2002b ) .",
    "some typical properties are already apparent , however , as for instance :    * dynamos that are dominated by a nearly axial dipole and exhibit a magnetic energy that exceeds the kinetic one by orders of magnitude as in the case of the earth are typical for high effective prandtl numbers as must be expected when convection is primarily driven by compositional buoyancy .",
    "the rather earth like appearance of the dynamo of glatzmaier and roberts ( 1995 ) is in part due to the high value of @xmath48 used in their computational model .",
    "* dynamos exhibiting strong higher harmonics are more likely driven by thermal convection corresponding to prandtl numbers of the order unity or less . *",
    "dynamo oscillations are a likely phenomenon in the presence of a sufficiently strong differential rotation",
    ". they may not always be apparent in the poloidal magnetic field seen at a distance from the dynamo region . *",
    "considerations based on the effects on convection of an imposed homogeneous magnetic field can not directly be applied to the case of convection driven dynamos .",
    "more details on the parameter dependence of dynamos will certainly emerge in the future as the increasingly available computer capacity will allow extensions of the parameter space accessible to computer simulations .",
    "space probes such as messenger in the case of mercury will provide much needed detailed information on planetary magnetic fields .",
    "eventually we may learn more about their variation in time which is one of the most interesting properties of planetary magnetic fields .",
    "as in the case of stellar magnetism where the study of star spots and stellar magnetic cycles is contributing to the understanding of solar magnetism it may eventually become possible to learn about the magnetism of extrasolar planets and apply this knowledge for an improved understanding of solar system dynamos . undoubtedly the field of planetary magnetism will continue to be an exciting one !",
