    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are point - like non - nuclear sources in external galaxies with apparent x - ray luminosities greater than the eddington limit of stellar mass black holes , i.e. , @xmath4@xmath5  ergs  s@xmath6 . the existence of ulxs has been known since the first _ einstein _",
    "observations of nearby galaxies @xcite but only with the sub - arcsecond imaging capability of the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory have investigations at other wavelengths of the crowded fields of nearby galaxies become viable .",
    "multi - wavelength investigations enable a much broader range of diagnostic techniques in the study of ulxs than can be achieved by x - ray data analysis alone .",
    "in particular , traditional methods in optical imaging and spectroscopy can be used to constrain the age , metallicity and physical state of the local environments of ulxs .",
    "this , in turn , can help to determine the origin and history of the ulxs themselves and lead to a better understanding of the influence of ulxs on their surroundings .",
    "many of the models for ulxs favor young high - mass x - ray binary systems ( see , e.g. , the reviews by @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these objects should be preferentially associated with massive star forming regions such as ob associations and , at the high - mass limit , superstar clusters .",
    "these environments should be strong sources of line emission through photoionization by massive stars , supernovae ( sne ) and by the ulx itself and may display enhanced forbidden line emission from shock excitation by stellar winds , sne , and by energetic outflows and jets that could accompany the ulx x - ray emission .",
    "nebulae such as those associated with the ulxs in ho  ix @xcite , ngc 5408 @xcite , ngc 5204 @xcite , and ho  ii @xcite are among the best - studied examples of this intricate ulx / star - formation connection .",
    "as part of a program of spectroscopic studies of the local envrironments of ulx candidates , we have obtained a moderate - resolution long - slit spectrum of a ulx in ngc  7331 .",
    "the x - ray characteristics of this ulx and the optical photometric properties of its environment are described in   [ s : obs ] .",
    "the ulx lies roughly in the center of an extended h  ii  region , cataloged as p98 @xcite , and within 30  pc of the center of a bright blue emission region .",
    "the optical spectrum of this emission region is presented in   [ s : spec ] .",
    "we model its spectrum as emission from a young star cluster combined with a nebula photoionized by a cluster hosting an x - ray source (   [ s : results ] ) .",
    "this model reproduces the observed @xmath7     continuum spectrum but under - predicts several strong observed emission lines .",
    "we argue (   [ s : shocks ] ) these lines are due , at least in part , to shock excitation associated with the ulx and that radiative and mechanical feedback plays an important part in the overall energetics of the emission region .",

    "we computed a grid of models for cluster ages , @xmath49 , ranging from 1 to 30  myr .",
    "the model spectra were fit to the observed spectra allowing for a variable interstellar absorption component ( using the reddening curve of @xcite ) . since the starburst99 stellar cluster model does not predict a nebular emission line spectrum it was necessary to exclude all the bright observed emission lines in the model fitting .",
    "we find the best - fit parameters of the cluster model are @xmath50  myr , @xmath51 , @xmath52  m@xmath1  where @xmath53 is the cluster mass which scales linearly with the overall model normalization .",

    "we calculated a set of spherically - symmetric photoionization models with fixed inner ( 1  pc ) and outer ( 30  pc ) radii using cloudy96.01 .",
    "the inner radius is typical for a massive young star cluster ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the outer radius corresponds to the half - width of the slit in projection ( at the galaxy distance of 14.6  mpc ) .",
    "we have found that the choice of inner and outer radii do not strongly affect the results .",

    "the models proved insensitive to the additional x - ray and corresponding euv radiation from the ulx .",
    "this was anticipated because the number flux from the cluster model in the ly  continuum ( @xmath3410@xmath63  s@xmath6 ) far exceeds the flux of x - ray photons even after extrapolating this rather steep x - ray spectrum to the ly  edge .",

    "further , the residual [ o  iii ]  @xmath68 ratio is low , @xmath3420 , compared to typical photoionized h  ii  regions .",
    "the observed excesses in these low - excitation lines and the low [ o  iii ]  ratio are likely caused by shock excitation in the nebula ( cf .",
    "we can identify three plausible sources for shock excitation : ( _ i _ ) individual sne in the stellar cluster , ( _ ii _ ) the cumulative stellar wind in the cluster , and ( _ iii _ ) the ulx source . here",
    "we make only rough estimates of the possible contributions from these three sources ; we lack sufficient knowledge of the physical conditions in the nebula ( e.g. , shock velocity , pressure , density , temperature , and pre - shock ionization ) to apply a full shock - excitation model for the emission lines .",
    "the starburst99 models predict the total supernova production rate in a cluster of age @xmath69  myr and mass @xmath70  m@xmath1 and a salpeter imf is about @xmath71  yr@xmath6 .",
    "since snrs are visible in emission lines for up to @xmath72 years @xcite , the effective number of snrs contributing to the spectrum is at most @xmath73 .",
    "typical h@xmath10 and [ s  ii ] luminosities from an individual snr are @xmath74 } \\sim ( 3 - 6 ) \\times 10^{36}$ ]  ergs  s@xmath6   @xcite .",
    "the expected luminosity in these lines from 6 snrs is then @xmath75  ergs  s@xmath6 , or 5 to 10 times less than the residual luminosities listed in table  1 .    at the estimated age of 4.25  myr ,",
    "the starburst99 model predicts equal contributions from sne and stellar winds to the mechanical luminosity of the cluster . if the conversion efficiencies from mechanical luminosity input to emission line radiation are the same for sne and stellar winds , winds will contribute a comparable amount to the shock - excited lines .",
    "the combination of sne and stellar winds still leaves the [ s  ii ]  @xmath666717 , 6731 production about 2.5 to 5 times below that needed to explain the observed luminosity .",
    "the third plausible source for shock excitation is the ulx .",
    "the presence of such an object in the cluster may contribute to the residual line emissions if mechanical energy from the x - ray source can be imparted to its surroundings in the form of an outflow .",
    "it has been postulated that some ulxs are microquasars @xcite , whose radiation is collimated along the jet axis , or supercritical accretion disks with outflows like that in ss433 @xcite .    in the case of microquasars , outflow in the form of a leptonic jet",
    "could occur during the low state and during outbursts associated with transitions within the very - high / intermediate states ( fender , pooley , & gallo 2004 ; corbel et al .",
    "however , utilizing the known correlation between x - ray and radio luminosities for black holes in the low - hard x - ray state ( corbel et al .",
    "2003 ; gallo , fender , & pooley 2003 ) to estimate the mechanical power in the jet and assuming the _ chandra _  observation of cxou  j223706  was obtained when the source was near eddington , then the power in the jet is @xmath76  ergs  s@xmath6  even allowing for additional transient ejection events ( fender , belloni , & gallo 2004 ) .",
    "the mechanical power imparted to the surrounding nebula in the form of outflow from microquasar - like jets from the ulx is then far less than needed to explain the residual line emission .",
    "[ note that the galactic microquasars like 1e  1740.7 - 2942 and grs  1758 - 258 ( mirabel et al .",
    "1993 ) , for instance , have presistent lobe - like emission but are old stellar systems lacking associations with young energetic nebulae . ]    in the case of ss433-like objects , outflow is in the form of persisent heavy jets that impart a large fraction of their accretion energy into their surroundings in the form of mechanical energy .",
    "the observed kinetic luminosity in the two jets of ss433 is @xmath77  ergs  s@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "this is comparable to the predicted mechanical luminosity from stellar winds and sne in the star cluster associated with cxou  j223706 , @xmath78  ergs  s@xmath6 , at its age of 4.25  myr .",
    "likely all three sources of shock excitation contribute to the observed line emission .",
    "the ulx can be an important , and even dominant , source of radiative and mechanical feedback in the overall energetics of the emission region .",
    "we have presented optical photometric and spectroscopic data that help to describe the physical environment surrounding the ulx cxou  j223706  in ngc  7331 .",
    "cxou  j223706  is spatially - coincident ( within astrometrical errors ) with a bright , young , @xmath2  myr , star cluster of mass @xmath0  m@xmath1 .",
    "if the ulx is a part of this bright stellar cluster , then the progenitor of the compact accretor must have been at least as massive as 40 - 50  m@xmath1 in order to have already evolved through the supernova stage .",
    "the companion star is also likely massive and evolved in order to provide the high mass accretion rate needed to power the ulx .",
    "the emission line spectrum of the surrounding nebula can be interpreted as a result of photoinization produced by the cluster uv spectrum , but an additional source of shock excitation is needed to understand the observed [ s  ii ] , [ oi ] and [ nii ] line intensities .",
    "the mechanical input from sne and stellar winds from the star cluster can account for only @xmath342040% of the required shock excitation so some additional energy source is needed .",
    "the obvious candidate is the ulx itself .",
    "emission nebulae associated with nearby ulxs are apparently a common phenomenon .",
    "although no formal census has been undertaken , we find potential associations with bright , extended optical structures for 67 of the 154 ulx candidates tabulated in the ulx survey of swartz et al .",
    "although these associations are based mainly upon digitized sky survey images and must await more conclusive analysis , many detailed studies of ulxs with associated nebulae have appeared in the recent literature @xcite .    in particular , the nebula associated with cxou  j223706  in ngc  7331  can be compared with the compact nebula mf16 associated with the ulx ngc6946  x-1 @xcite .",
    "the mf16 nebula is an isolated object : it does not appear to be contaminated by associated star clusters or nearby hii regions .",
    "the line luminosities of mf16 @xcite are @xmath79 } } \\approx l_{{\\rm h\\alpha } } \\approx 2 \\times 10^{38}$ ]  ergs  s@xmath6 , @xmath80  ergs  s@xmath6 ; equal to the residual line luminosities in the ngc  7331  nebula ( table  1 ) .",
    "on the other hand , [ o  iii ]  @xmath81 and [ o  i ]  @xmath82 lines in mf16 are 3.5 times brighter than those in the ngc  7331  residuals .",
    "these two lines are excited in different ways : by uv photoionization in the case of [ o  iii ]  @xmath81 and by shock excitation in the case of [ o  i ]  @xmath82  .",
    "additional sources of mechanical energy in the form of more or less collimated winds or jets is not unprecedented in ulx nebulae . in the nebulae of ulxs ngc6946  x-1 and holmbergii  x-1 ( another `` isolated '' ulx nebula ) , radial velocity gradients of @xmath83  km",
    "s@xmath6 have been found @xcite .",
    "it was concluded that the nebulae have to be powered by the central ulxs and that , therefore , the ulxs must also provide a source of gas collisional excitation in the ulx - associated nebulae .",

    "<S> the companion star is also likely an evolved massive star . </S>",
    "<S> the emission line spectrum of the nebula surrounding the cluster can be interpreted as a result of photoionization by the cluster ob stars with an additional source of shock excitation producing strong [ s  ii ] , [ o  i ]  and n  ii  lines . </S>",
    "<S> this additional source appears to be as much as five times more powerful than the supernovae and stellar winds in the cluster can provide . </S>",
    "<S> additional mechanical energy input associated with the ulx itself can help explain the residual shock excited line luminosities of the emission region . </S>"
