    "motivated by the close analogy with non - abelian lattice gauge theories in four dimensions non - linear @xmath3-models in two dimensions have been studied intensively during the last 20 years .",
    "most important both types of models were found to be asymptotically free @xcite .",
    "starting from the early eighties so called @xmath0 models were discussed .",
    "the spins of these models are elements of the real projective space in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "this space can be thought of as a sphere @xmath6 where opposite points are identified .",
    "hence in perturbation theory the @xmath0 model is equivalent with the @xmath2-invariant @xmath3-model .",
    "the fact however that the real projective space is not simply connected gives rise to topological defect structures similar to vortices in the 2d @xmath7 model .",
    "the questions discussed in the literature are whether these defects induce a phase transition at a finite coupling or whether these non - perturbative effects survive in the weak coupling limit .",
    "the lattice action of the @xmath0 model mostly discussed is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a pair of nearest neighbour points on the lattice and @xmath10 is a unit vector in @xmath11 .",
    "an alternative way to identify @xmath12 and @xmath13 is to introduce an @xmath14 gauge field @xmath15 where @xmath16 takes the values @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "similar models have been introduced to describe orientational phase transitions in nematic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "these models have mainly been studied in three dimensions , where a weak first order phase transition is found ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references given in @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical study of @xmath0 models in 2d gave rise to much controversy .",
    "some authors @xcite find that their results are consistent with a phase transition at a finite coupling , while others doubt the existence of a phase transition but still see strong crossover effects between the strong and the weak coupling regime @xcite .",
    "recently caracciolo et al .",
    "@xcite argued that there is no phase transition in the @xmath0 models .",
    "they claimed , based on a finite size scaling analysis , that the @xmath0 models however have a weak coupling limit distinct from that of the @xmath2-invariant @xmath3-models .",
    "they claim even further , that a whole sequence of universality classes can be obtained from mixed models .    in the following i",
    "will give evidence that rules out the scenario presented in @xcite .",
    "for a particular type of the action of the @xmath2 and the @xmath0 model i will show that the models are exactly equivalent for sufficiently small coupling .",
    "i discuss the scaling properties of vortices of the @xmath0 model with standard action in the weak coupling regime .",
    "i give numerical results for the step scaling function introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite that supports that the constraint model gives the same universal results as the standard action .",
    "i show that the differences in the finite size scaling curves for the @xmath19 and the @xmath20 model found in refs .",
    "@xcite can be explained as a boundary effect .",
    "let me first define the models .",
    "the field variable @xmath13 is in both cases a unit vector in @xmath11 . in the case of the @xmath2-invariant model",
    "the boltzmann weight of a configuration is equal to @xmath17 if @xmath21 for all nearest neighbour pairs of sites @xmath9 .",
    "else the boltzmann weight is equal to @xmath22 .    in the case of the @xmath0 model @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "are identified and the constraint on the field configuration is given by @xmath23 for all nearest neighbours @xmath9 .",
    "equivalently one might introduce a gauge field @xmath24 taking the values @xmath18 or @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath25    in the following i shall show that the constraint @xmath2-invariant model and the constraint @xmath0 model are equivalent for @xmath26 .",
    "let us consider a lattice where all closed paths are contractible , i.e. all closed paths can be shrinked to an elementary plaquette by removing single plaquettes sequentially .",
    "a hyper - cubical square lattice with open boundary conditions is an example for such a lattice .",
    "consider the class of @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the number of lattice points , configurations that arise from a given configuration @xmath13 by taking either @xmath29 or @xmath12 at each lattice point .",
    "since @xmath30 all configurations in such a class are either allowed or forbidden @xmath0 configurations .",
    "obviously a class of configurations that is forbidden under the @xmath0 constraint contains no configuration that is allowed under the @xmath2 constraint ( with the same @xmath31 ) . in the following",
    "i will demonstrate that for @xmath32 a class of configurations that is allowed under the @xmath0 constraint contains exactly @xmath33 configurations allowed under the @xmath2 constraint , and therefore the partition functions are equal up to a trivial factor @xmath34 .",
    "take one configuration out of an allowed class of @xmath0 configurations .",
    "pick one site @xmath35 . replace the spins on the other sites by @xmath36 the result of this construction",
    "is independent of the paths chosen if @xmath37 for all closed paths on the lattice . for elementary loops consisting of four lattice - points",
    "this is the case for @xmath32 .",
    "all other paths can be successively built up out of elementary loops , since we have chosen a simply connected lattice topology . when adding an elementary loop the sign of a loop is conserved since the sign of the product of the new links in the path is the same as for the old links .",
    "hence the sign of any closed path is @xmath17 for @xmath26 .",
    "the idea behind this proof has been discussed for an action similar to that in eq .",
    "( 2 ) by caselle and gliozzi @xcite .",
    "however for that action the rigorous proof for a pure gauge in the weak coupling limit is missing .    in monte carlo simulations",
    "one typically uses periodic boundary conditions , which leads to the lattice topology of a torus . here",
    "loops exist that wind around the torus and hence can not be contracted to an elementary loop .    in order to avoid configurations that are allowed under the @xmath0 constraint but not for @xmath2 one",
    "has to require @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the extension of the lattice in units of the lattice spacing .",
    "it is important to note that such boundary effects might well survive the continuum limit in a finite size scaling analysis .",
    "however this boundary effect can be reproduced by proper boundary conditions imposed upon the @xmath2 model . for @xmath40 a constraint @xmath0 model on a periodic lattice",
    "is equivalent to a constraint @xmath2 model with fluctuating boundary conditions .",
    "fluctuating boundary conditions mean that in the partition function one sums over periodic as well as anti - periodic boundary conditions . in the case of anti - periodic boundary conditions",
    "one identifies @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "for the standard actions of the @xmath0 model similar arguments apply . in the limit @xmath45 the energy of a vortex should win against the entropy and vortices should play no role in the continuum limit of the theory .",
    "let us identify a frustrated plaquette in eq .",
    "( 2 ) with the center of a vortex .",
    "the classical solution of the @xmath10-field for a fixed gauge field with two frustrated plaquettes has an energy proportional to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the distance in between these two frustrated plaquettes .",
    "hence one can find a finite @xmath48 such that the energy is larger than @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the leading coefficient in the perturbative @xmath51-function .",
    "therefore the density of vortex pairs with a distance larger than @xmath48 dies out faster than the square of the inverse correlation length .",
    "hence they can not play a role in the continuum limit of the theory .",
    "in this section i show that the constraint @xmath2 model reproduces universal results of the @xmath2-invariant @xmath3-model .",
    "therefore i compute the step scaling function of ref .",
    "@xcite for three different values of the running coupling and compare the result with that of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained with the standard action .",
    "furthermore i estimate the correlation length at @xmath52 using the running coupling and also measure the correlation length for both the @xmath2 and the @xmath0 model for @xmath53 to check the importance of defects in the generation of the mass in the @xmath0 case .    the running coupling of ref .",
    "@xcite is defined by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the mass gap on a lattice with extension @xmath39 in spatial direction .",
    "the @xmath51-function for the running coupling @xmath56 is given by @xcite @xmath57 the step scaling function @xmath58 is the discrete version of the @xmath51-function .",
    "it gives the value of the coupling after change of @xmath39 by a factor of @xmath59 starting from a coupling @xmath60 .",
    "the simulation was done using the evident modification of the single cluster algorithm @xcite .",
    "a bond @xmath9 is called deleted if after the reflection of one of the spins @xmath13 or @xmath61 the constraint @xmath62 is still satisfied .    a proof of ergodicity is given in the appendix .",
    "the simulation results listed in table 1 are based on about @xmath63 single cluster updates .",
    "the correlation function was measured using the cluster - improved estimator @xcite .",
    "the mass was extracted from the correlation function at distance @xmath39 and @xmath64 .",
    "fitting the data of table 1 to an ansatz @xmath65 i obtain @xmath66 from @xmath67 , @xmath68 from @xmath69 and @xmath70 from @xmath71 .",
    "these results can be compared with the step scaling function obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the slight disagreement ( about 2 standard deviations ) might well be explained by deviations of the corrections to finite size scaling from the fit - ansatz chosen .    the exact prediction for the mass gap given by @xcite @xmath75 for @xmath76 and the conversion factor for the @xmath77 parameters @xmath78 given in ref .",
    "@xcite allows us to give an estimate for the infinite volume correlation length based on the measurement of the correlation length on a finite lattice .",
    "taking the monte carlo result for the running coupling given in table 1 i obtain @xmath79 as estimate for the correlation length at @xmath80 and @xmath81 as estimate at @xmath52 , where the @xmath20 and @xmath19 constraint models become identical .",
    "in addition i performed some simulations for both the constraint @xmath2 model and the constraint @xmath0 model at smaller @xmath31 values such that the correlation length @xmath82 is much smaller than the lattice size @xmath39 . here",
    "i adopted the definitions used in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the correlation function in the vector - channel is defined by @xmath83 since naively this quantity vanishes identically under the symmetries of the @xmath84 model one considers the tensor channel with the correlation function @xmath85 starting from these definitions of the correlation function one obtains the susceptibility @xmath86 and @xmath87 with @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "the second moment correlation length is now defined as @xmath90    in table 2 some results for the constraint @xmath20 model are given .",
    "it is remarkable that already for @xmath91 the correlation length is larger than ten .",
    "the ratio of the correlation length in the vector and the tensor channel is about @xmath92 .    in table 3",
    "my results for the constraint @xmath93 model are summarized . at @xmath80",
    "there is a factor of about @xmath94 in between the correlation lengths of the @xmath20 and the @xmath93 model .",
    "this means that it is practically impossible to see the true asymptotic behaviour of the constraint @xmath19 model in a computer simulation .",
    "in this section i shall demonstrate that the difference in the finite size scaling curves observed in @xcite and @xcite can be explained in part by the boundary effect discussed above .",
    "i simulated the @xmath20-invariant model with the standard action on a square lattice using fluctuating boundary conditions in both lattice - directions .",
    "for the updates of the boundary conditions i used the boundary flip algorithm proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the ising model and generalized to @xmath2 vector models in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "i performed runs at @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the true correlation lengths for these @xmath51 values are @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively @xcite .",
    "i used lattice sizes ranging from @xmath101 to @xmath102 . throughout",
    "i performed 100000 measurements .",
    "i performed a measurement after one boundary - flip update for each direction and roughly @xmath103-@xmath104-@xmath105 standard single cluster updates . in figure 1 the dimensionless quantity @xmath106",
    "is plotted as a function of @xmath107 .",
    "i give the results for fluctuating boundary conditions ( circles ) and for comparison the results with periodic boundary conditions ( diamonds ) . in order to compare with fig .",
    "@xcite one has to take the factor @xmath108 into account .",
    "my result for periodic boundary conditions is consistent with that given in fig .",
    "2b of ref .",
    "the fluctuating boundary conditions remove the characteristic dip visible in the finite size scaling curve for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the finite size scaling curve for periodic boundary conditions looks qualitatively much like that of fig .",

    "2a of ref .",
    "@xcite are effected by strong corrections to scaling due to vortices .",
    "in order to understand the phase - structure of the @xmath0 models one might , in analogy with the @xmath109 scenario of the @xmath7 model @xcite , discuss the rg - flow of the models in a 2 dimensional parameter space .",
    "in addition to the coupling @xmath110 one might introduce a coupling parameter @xmath111 for the plaquette - term , controlling the density of vortices .",

    ". therefore a non - vanishing @xmath111 should amount to a positive contribution in the derivative of @xmath110 with respect to the logarithm of the cutoff scale and hence accelerate the flow towards strong coupling .",
    "statement a ) rules out that a possible phase transition in @xmath0 is @xmath109 like , since the fixed - point of the @xmath109-transition is purely gaussian .",
    "furthermore statement b ) rules out any fixed - point that might occur at a finite @xmath111 .",
    "still we have to explain why monte carlo simulations and strong coupling expansions seem to be in favour of a phase transition .",
    "it seems plausible that in analogy with the @xmath109-flow equations @xmath111 is irrelevant for small coupling @xmath110 but becomes relevant above some threshold value @xmath115 .",
    "that means above @xmath115 the rg - trajectories are driven off from the renormalized trajectory of the @xmath2-invariant model .",
    "i have proven that the constraint @xmath2 and constraint @xmath0 model become equivalent for @xmath32 . using the renormalized coupling @xmath116 i estimated the correlation length at @xmath117 to be about @xmath118 for both models with @xmath76 . for @xmath31-values being smaller ,",
    "such that @xmath119 , the models display huge differences .",
    "this means that the asymptotic behaviour of the constraint @xmath19 practically can not be observed in a computer simulation .",
    "i argue that a similar scenario holds for models with a standard action . as @xmath45 vortices in the @xmath0 model vanish and the @xmath0 becomes equivalent to an @xmath2 model by the virtue of a gauge fixing .",
    "on lattices with periodic boundary conditions one has to notice that paths winding around the lattice are not contractible .",
    "the effect of such loops in the @xmath0 model amount to fluctuating boundary conditions in the equivalent @xmath2 model .",
    "i demonstrated numerically that this fact partially explains the differences found in the finite size scaling curves for the @xmath20 and @xmath19 models observed in refs .  @xcite .",
