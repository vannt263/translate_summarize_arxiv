    "the masses of quarks are  @xcite : @xmath1 and @xmath2 the quark spectrum is characterized by the following striking features : ( 1 ) there is a large hierarchy between quark masses from different families , @xmath3 ( 2 ) the isospin violation is also hierarchical : it is very strong in the third family , strong ( although essentially weaker ) in the second family , and mild in the first one : @xmath4 the origin of these features is still mysterious : in the standard model ( sm ) , it is required to introduce hierarchical yukawa couplings by hand , e.g. , @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    ", we will introduce a new class of models describing the quark mass hierarchy .",
    "one of our basic assumptions is the separation of the dynamics triggering the strong isospin violation in the third and second families from that responsible for the generation of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 masses , i.e. , electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "the latter could be provided by one of the following known mechanisms : a ) an elementary higgs field ( or fields ) .",
    "b ) a modern version of the technicolor ( tc ) scenario ( for recent reviews , see ref .",
    "c ) at last , it could be a dynamical higgs mechanism with a higgs doublet ( or doublets ) composed of @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks of the fourth family  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the dynamics primarily responsible for the ewsb leads to the mass spectrum of quarks with no ( or weak ) isospin violation .",
    "_ moreover , we assume that the values of these masses are of the order of the observed masses of the down - type quarks .",
    "_ in the case of an elementary higgs field ( or fields ) , they are provided by the conventional yukawa interactions . in the case of the dynamical higgs mechanism , in order to generate these masses , one should use flavor - changing - neutral ( fcn ) interactions : the extended technicolor ( etc )  @xcite in the case of the tc scenario , and the horizontal interactions between the 4th family and the first three ones in the case of the scenario with the fourth family ( see fig .  [ tp - ui ] ) .",
    "of course , such interactions are restricted by the @xmath10-@xmath11 mixing , for example , and thus for light quarks it is required to introduce heavy exchange vector particles , say , with the masses of order 1000 tev .",
    "such heavy particles can be a natural source for producing small yukawa coupling constants for light quarks . for heavier quarks ,",
    "we introduce lighter vector particles .",
    "+    the second ( central ) stage is introducing the horizontal interactions for the quarks in the first three families ( this stage is essentially the same for the three ewsb mechanisms mentioned above . ) first , following the idea in the model of mendel et al .",
    "@xcite , we utilize strong ( although _ subcritical _ ) diagonal horizontal interactions for the top quark which lead to the observed ratio @xmath12 .",
    "the second step is introducing the equal strengths horizontal fcn interactions between the @xmath0 and @xmath13 quarks and the @xmath14 and @xmath15 ones in order to get the observed ratio @xmath16 in the second family ( see fig .",
    "[ c - t ] ) . as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ 2.2 ] , these interactions can naturally provide such a ratio indeed .",
    "because of a smallness of the mixing angles for quarks from the different families , neglecting the family mixing in the dynamics responsible for generating the quark masses in the second and third families is a reasonable approximation .",
    "concerning the mild isospin violation in the first family , it should be studied together with the effects of the family mixing , reflected in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "the latter will be considered in sec .  [ 2.3 ] .",
    "thus , in the present scenario , beside the ewsb interactions , the dominant dynamics responsible for the form of the mass spectrum of quarks is connected with the diagonal horizontal interactions for the third family and the horizontal fcn interactions between the second and third ones .",
    "the signature of this scenario is the appearance of composite higgs bosons ( resonances ) composed of the quarks and antiquarks of the 3rd family ( see sec .  [ 2.4 ] )    the main source of the isospin violation in this approach is the strong top quark interactions .",
    "on the other hand , because these interactions are subcritical , the top quark plays a minor role in electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this point distinguishes this scenario from the top quark condensate model  @xcite .",
    "two comments are in order .",
    "( i ) as will be shown below , the characteristic feature in this class of the models is the absence of fine tuning : what could be called fine tuning for the nearcritical coupling of the @xmath0 quark ( 1 part in @xmath17 ) is just a reflection of a `` unnaturally '' large isospin violation in the third family , @xmath18 .",
    "( ii ) in this paper , we will concentrate on studying the mass spectrum of quarks . for a discussion concerning",
    "the extension of the present approach for the description of lepton masses , see sec .  [ 4 ] below .",
    "in this section , the dynamics for generating the quark mass hierarchy will be described in detail .",
    "henceforth we will concentrate on a model of the dynamical ewsb with the fourth family  @xcite .",
    "however , we will also comment on the modifications ( if any ) for both the scenario with elementary higgs fields responsible for the ewsb and the tc scenario .",
    "the first stage is generating the masses with no ( or weak ) isospin violation and of the order of the observed masses of the down - type quarks .",
    "as was pointed in the introduction , in the present approach , the ewsb dynamics is responsible for that .",
    "it is straightforward to produce such masses both in the case of the scenario with elementary higgs fields ( through yukawa interactions ) and in the tc one ( through etc interactions ) .",
    "let us now describe this stage in the scenario of the dynamical ewsb with the fourth family  @xcite .",
    "the masses of the 4th family quarks are constrained as  @xcite @xmath19 note that if the mixing angles between the 4th family and the rest ones are extremely small , @xmath20 and @xmath21 quarks behave like long - lived charged massive particles . in this case",
    "the constraints are @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 gev  @xcite .    at the composite scale @xmath24",
    ", the 4th family quarks @xmath21 and @xmath20 condense and thereby they break the electroweak symmetry . by using the pagels - stokar ( ps ) formula  @xcite",
    ", we can estimate the corresponding decay constants ,    [ ps ] @xmath25    with @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 gev .",
    "the constraint of the @xmath29-parameter suggests that @xmath30 is favorable and thereby @xmath31 follows .",
    "note that the masses of @xmath21 and @xmath20 are essentially determined through the ps formula ( [ ps ] ) when the value of @xmath24 is fixed .",
    "in order to obtain almost correct masses for the down - type quarks , @xmath32 we introduce the following horizontal fcn interactions ( see fig .",
    "[ tp - ui ] ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "these one - loop contributions yield @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents the quadratic casimir invariant and we took into account that the dynamical running @xmath39 and @xmath40 masses rapidly decrease above the scale @xmath24 ( if these masses are not sharply cutoff at @xmath24 , there can appear log@xmath41 factors in eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) , as in qcd  @xcite ) .    in order to obtain the hierarchical masses",
    "@xmath42 , we assume @xmath43 we may expect @xmath44 . then , at this stage , the mass spectrum of quarks is isospin symmetric .",
    "the running masses are essentially equal to the constants @xmath45 up to the scale of @xmath46 @xmath47 . above @xmath46 ,",
    "they rapidly , as @xmath48 , decrease ( @xmath49 is the momentum of the running masses ) .    in order to get the appropriate numbers , the scales should be determined by @xmath50      the second ( central ) stage in the present scenario is introducing the horizontal interactions for the three known fermion families .",
    "note that this stage is essentially identical for the scenarios with the different ewsb dynamics : elementary higgs fields , tc , and the fourth family .",
    "let us start from the description of the dynamics generating the large top quark mass . at energy scales",
    "less than the mass of a horizontal vector boson @xmath51 , the corresponding horizontal interactions can be presented by the four - fermion nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) ones .",
    "we apply strong ( although subcritical ) dynamics for the horizontal diagonal interactions for the @xmath0 quark .",
    "the isospin symmetric mass @xmath52 , introduced in sec .",
    "[ 2.1 ] , plays the role of a bare mass with respect to these interactions .",
    "the solution of the schwinger - dyson equation for the @xmath0 quark propagator leads to the following mass @xmath53 @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the difference of the critical coupling and the ( normalized ) dimensionless njl one for a @xmath49 quark , so that @xmath56 where we used @xmath57 gev and @xmath58 gev .",

    "concrete models for obtaining such a isospin symmetry breakdown in the third family are described in appendix  [ a ] .",
    "let us now turn to the generation of the realistic masses for the second family .",

    "[ c - t ] ) , @xmath63 these one - loop diagrams yield the following masses for charm and strange quarks : @xmath64 where @xmath65 mev is the isospin symmetric mass for the second family ( see sec . [ 2.1 ] ) , and @xmath66 are @xmath67 for @xmath68 . as described above , the ratio @xmath69 is obtained via the near - critical dynamics in this model . now , taking @xmath70 mev and @xmath71 , we get @xmath72 in this way , we can obtain the correct mass enhancement for the charm quark via the large @xmath53 .",
    "_ let us emphasize that the presence of the isospin symmetric mass @xmath73 is crucial here : with @xmath74 mev , the ratio @xmath75 would be close to @xmath76 .",
    "_    as to the horizontal fcn gauge bosons which couple to the quarks of the 1st and 2nd families , we assume that they are very heavy , @xmath77 with @xmath78 . as a result , their contributions to the masses of the @xmath79 and @xmath80 quarks are very small .      the parameter @xmath81 is described in text .",
    "[ mass - mixing ]    so far we have neglected the family mixing effects . because the mixing angles between quarks from the different families are small , such an approach can be considered as a reasonable approximation for the description of generating quark masses in the second and third quark families . here",
    "we will turn to the structure of the ckm mass matrix .",
    "recall that the number of the cp phases is three in the 4th family quark model , whereas the three generation model has only one cp phase  @xcite .",
    "this can offer richer phenomenology , for example , in the @xmath82 physics . in this paper , however , we ignore the cp violation and concentrate on the family mixing effects .",
    "there are several approaches to this problem : ( 1 ) mass texture anstze ( for example , the fritzsch - type mass matrix  @xcite , the democratic family mixing , etc . ) .",

    "@xcite that is appropriate for the model with the 4th family .",
    "let us start from the down - type quark masses .",
    "we assume that    1 .   there exist horizontal fcn interactions with a mixing of @xmath83 and @xmath84 gauge bosons related to two different families @xmath85 and @xmath86 , one of which is the first one ( see fig .",
    "[ mass - mixing ] ) .",
    "we further assume that the values of all the relevant parameters ( the masses of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and the gauge boson mixing parameters ) are around the scale @xmath87 . in this case , we obtain naturally a universal mass @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "2 .   similarly , when neither @xmath85 nor @xmath86 are @xmath90 , there exist horizontal fcn interactions with a mixing for another set of @xmath91 and @xmath92 gauge bosons . in this case",
    ", the values of all the relevant parameters are assumed to be around @xmath93 .",
    "this leads to a universal mass @xmath94 .",
    "we can then explicitly write the mass matrix @xmath95 for the down - type quark as @xmath96 the parameters @xmath97 will be determined by @xmath98 and @xmath99 later . as to the diagonal mass terms , the values of @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath40 are almost the same as the mass eigenvalues , whereas it is required to adjust numerically the value of @xmath102 in order to obtain the correct mass eigenvalue for the down quark .    for the up - type quarks , the mass matrix has a similar structure with the replacement of @xmath103 by @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "since the mass matrix @xmath95 is symmetric , it can be diagonalized by a single orthogonal matrix @xmath105 .",
    "similarly , the up - type quark mass matrix can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath107 ckm matrix @xmath108 is given by @xmath109    noting that @xmath110 , we approximately obtain the matrix @xmath105 as    @xmath111    where we took into account that the quadratic term @xmath112 .    on the other hand , since numerically @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 , we can neglect the off - diagonal entries of @xmath106 in the @xmath116 part of the ckm matrix .",
    "then we get : @xmath117 the relation @xmath118 is noticeable .",
