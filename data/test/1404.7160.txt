    "correlation and interference distinguish quantum from classical mechanics .",

    "the latter is most familiar as a probability density function for an outcome that can be achieved in at least two indistinguishable ways .",
    "however , interference can also be generated by superposing many - body states in indistinguishable ways @xcite .",
    "experimental confirmation of quantum correlation has involved photons @xcite , atoms @xcite , and josephson phase qubits @xcite . however , there is little experimental evidence of correlated interference between massive particles .",
    "the boundary between the classical and quantum regimes continues to be an area of interest both in attempts to explain why quantum effects are difficult to measure on a macroscopic scale @xcite and in attempts to measure quantum effects on a macroscopic object @xcite .",
    "reflection measurement methods used in an attempt to extend this boundary involve light interacting with stationary @xcite and oscillating mirrors @xcite and with microwaves interacting with an oscillating mirror @xcite .",
    "reflection of a single photon from an oscillating mirror @xcite and using a bose einstein condensate as a mirror from which photons reflect @xcite have been studied .    to extend this boundary to larger masses , we model correlation of a mesoscopic / macroscopic ` mirror ' with a non - zero rest mass microscopic ` particle ' after elastic reflection .",
    "motion is in free space along one dimension and all states are unbound",
    ". measurements of particle reflection , but not associated with correlated interference , have involved mirrors that reflect atoms @xcite and bose - einstein condensates @xcite , atoms reflecting from a solid surface @xcite , neutrons @xcite and atoms @xcite reflecting from vibrating mirrors , and atoms reflecting from a switchable mirror @xcite .",
    "if the particle and mirror are initially in eigenstates of energy then the following two states interfere : the particle - mirror state before the particle reflects from the mirror and the particle - mirror state after reflection ( interference is a consequence of the incident and reflected states being indistinguishable for a measurement of position ) .",
    "this is similar to the standing wave interference of a harmonic electromagnetic wave reflecting from a stationary mirror @xcite .",
    "classically , however , the incident and reflected waves interfere while the mirror experiences only a continuous force due to radiation pressure .",
    "the two - body quantum analogy involves solving the schrdinger equation with an interaction potential modeling the reflection .",
    "interference is expected between the incident and reflected particle substates _ along with _ interference of the mirror substates which have and have not reflected the particle .",
    "their correlation is perhaps not expected , being a consequence of the solution to the schrdinger equation from which a joint probability density function is constructed .",
    "this joint pdf then describes the correlations in the two - body interference which are manifest as coincidence rates , e.g. a correlation in the simultaneous measurement of particle _ and _ mirror positions .",
    "asynchronous measurement in such a system has also been discussed @xcite .",
    "any experimental realization of such an interferometer will involve wavegroups . while the coherence length for the particle currently can be as large as @xmath0 m for atoms released from a bose - einstein condensate , that for a mesoscopic / macroscopic mirror will be many orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "however , the coherence length of the two - body state involves that of both the particle and mirror substates .",
    "the two - body interference in reflection from a mirror is then limited spatially ( to the overlap region ) and temporally ( to the time of overlap ) in a manner similar to that of a pulse of light reflecting from a moving mirror .    classical interference in reflection",
    "is more robust when the pulse of light reflects from a moving thin film for two main reasons : first the reflected pulses from each thin film surface maintain overlap as they both travel in the backward direction and second they have the same doppler shift ( since they reflect from interfaces moving at the same speed ) .",
    "interference is then limited by a pulse coherence length which at its minimum is of order the film thickness .",
    "to achieve such robust two - body quantum interference we consider the analogous two - body situation , an example of which is a neutron reflecting from each of the two surfaces of a moving aluminum ` slab . '",
    "it is shown below that this two - body interference has the same ` non - local ' characteristics as does a pulse of light reflecting from a moving thin film . treating both the particle and reflector as quantum objects yields the expected results of a one - body treatment ( analogous to interference for a pulse of light reflecting from a moving thin film ) but only as a special case .",
    "in addition , this treatment predicts novel reflection regimes depending on the coherence lengths of the particle and reflector .",
    "quantum two - body reflection differs from that classically .",
    "for example , the classical kinematics , associated with reflection of a wavegroup , involves accelerated mirror motion while the kinematics associated with the expectation value of the position of either the particle or mirror , during the interaction , depends on the two - body wavegroup parameters such as coherence lengths .",
    "this is discussed in section [ sec : summary ] . also , under conditions of destructive interference , the particle and slab will never simultaneously be observed .",
    "classically , only the pulse of light will never be observed .    a simultaneous measurement , however , is difficult to perform .",
    "a much simpler method involves only measuring the reflected particle .",
    "such a one - body measurement can reveal the quantum state of the reflector due to the effects of the reflector s coherence length on the two - body pdf , from which the one - body marginal pdf is derived .",
    "this manifestation of the macroscopic quantum state of the reflector on the interference measured only on the particle may be a practical way to verify that the mesoscopic / macroscopic reflector is indeed in a quantum state and thereby extend the quantum - classical boundary to larger masses .",
    "finding examples of mesoscopic / macroscopic quantum phenomena has been a topic of interest since early in the development of quantum mechanics , particularly with regard to validation issues .",
    "this continues to be a subject of interest .",
    "consider next some of the arguments used to explain why such effects are not observed with mesoscopic / macroscopic objects , in relation to the two - body treatment of particle reflection : ( 1 ) in an introductory quantum course , the lack of such evidence is often justified via the double slit experiment , where the fringe spacing becomes imperceptible as the mass increases . in the comments after eqn .",
    "[ eq : fringespacing ] , an explanation is given as to why the mirror fringe spacing does not shrink as its mass increases .",
    "( 2 ) another concern is if quantum correlation is indeed generated .",
    "the initial particle - mirror separable system becomes correlated in reflection as a consequence of conservation of energy and momentum .",
    "the discussion in section [ sec : summary ] demonstrates why interferometric quantum correlation is a requisite in satisfying these conservation laws .",
    "( 3 ) the difference in wavevectors of the interfering mesoscopic / macroscopic mirror substates , due to reflecting a microscopic particle , is much smaller than the spread in wavevectors of which the mirror wavegroup is composed , due to thermal motion .",
    "this effect is shown to not destroy interference in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "( 4 ) more recently , decoherence of the macroscopic superposition via interaction with the environment has been used to explain the lack of interference .",
    "mitigation of this and other decoherence mechanisms are discussed in section [ sec : decoher ] .",
    "this work examines the assumptions of these arguments in the context of reflection of a microscopic particle from a mesoscopic / macroscopic mirror .",
    "a synopsis of this work is as follows : first the schrdinger equation is solved for the two - body energy eigenstates in reflection from a moving mirror .",
    "wavegroups formed from these solutions are then used to illustrate interference in reflection with an emphasis on variations in coherence lengths of the mirror .",
    "coherence transfer from the particle to the mirror is also demonstrated and related to classical reflection .",
    "two models are next developed for two - body reflection of a particle from a slab , whose classical analog is that of reflection of a pulse of light from a moving thin film .",
    "the effects of the coherence lengths of both the particle and slab are then discussed .",
    "measurements of either the particle but not the slab and the slab but not the particle are then considered .",
    "finally , decoherence issues , as well as methods to measure a mesoscopic / macroscopic reflector in a superposition state , are addressed .",
    "the goal of this paper is to illustrate the unique interferometric properties of correlation interferometry in reflection .",
    "these properties are most easily understood using the example of a microscopic particle reflecting from a mesoscopic / macroscopic mirror .",
    "however , the focus on this example is not intended as a practical experimental proposal .",
    "observation of such correlated interference will most likely first occur with a microscopic particle reflecting from a `` microscopic '' mirror .",

    "a similar effect is found in the particle - well model .",

    "interference in a typical one - body interferometer ` washes - out ' as the fringe spacing becomes imperceptible with increasing mass .",
    "another mechanism that eliminates interference is a measurement to determine along which path the object traveled through the interferometer .",
    "the former issue was mitigated using two - body reflection of a microscopic particle from a mesoscopic / macroscopic object , as described above , while the latter is the first topic of this section .      a method to determine path information and therefore destroy interference utilizes a ` heisenberg microscope , ' where an additional particle scatters from the object traversing the interferometer .",

    "the contrast of the interference , as a function of @xmath203 , was shown to drop dramatically for @xmath227 .",
    "generating such decoherence for particle - mirror interference involves using a probe particle to determine the mirrors position during interference .",
    "the ` two paths ' exist only during the time that the incident and reflected two - body wavegroup states overlap for reflection from a mirror . during this time",

    "this decoherence mechanism can also be applied to the emission of photons by the slab between the times of particle reflection from each slab surface . if the photons wavelength is small enough to allow for the location of the slab associated with one of the reflections ( @xmath140 m in the neutron - slab example given above ) , interference is destroyed since it",
    "can then be determined at which slab surface the reflection occurred @xcite .",
    "obviously the probability of such a thermal photon emission is small .",
    "these calculations indicate that environmental decoherence associated with obtaining path information can potentially be mitigated .",
    "this is due in part to the displacements associated with the interfering reflector substates being proportional to @xmath234 . to measure such small displacements",
    "requires scattering particles with proportionally smaller wavelengths which are typically not found in the environment .",
    "it should be pointed out that the calculations presented above assume that states for the particle , mirror , and slab have a minimum spatial profile ( minimum uncertainty gaussian wavepackets ) .",
    "this will be referred to as a phased state .",
    "introducing a random phase into the fourier components of either one or both of the substates of such an incident two - body phased state affects the shape and size of the wavepacket while maintaining the same bandwidth and therefore the same coherence length .",
    "this is referred to as a dephased state .",
    "such random phase structure is introduced as an initial condition but could have been imposed via an earlier measurement which collapsed the reflector state into a dephased state .",
    "consider an incident phased particle substate and incident dephased mirror substate which then reflect .",
    "a one - body particle measurement after reflection can then act as a sensitive probe of this mirror substate . to illustrate this",
    "consider how the pdf of fig .",
    "[ fig : spreadvelocity]c changes for such a dephased state .",
    "first , the pdf is spread spatially along the @xmath3 axis .",
    "second , the magnitude of the interference part of the pdf is greatly reduced but not eliminated . finally , the pdf is not spatially uniform .",
    "apart from its magnitude and spatial uniformity , this pdf is more similar to fig . [",
    "fig : spreadvelocity]a than [ fig : spreadvelocity]c .",
    "this is not surprising since the localization of the dephased mirror substate is similar to that of the mirror in fig .",
    "[ fig : spreadvelocity]a .",
    "results of a particle - only measurement are predicted from an integral ( trace ) over the mirror coordinate of this pdf which then ` washes - out ' this interference .",
    "if the mirror is in a dephased state , a reflecting particle - only measurement will not exhibit interference in the overlap region .",
    "however , such interference is expected both when treating the mirror as a classical potential and for a phased mirror substate with the coherence lengths similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spreadvelocity]c .",
    "the spatial extent of such a dephased mirror substate can vary between being unlocalized to being the minimum size determined by the bandwidth .",
    "this size can then be probed by varying the wavelength of the incident particle in a reflected particle - only measurement , in which case interference either disappears or reappears as this wavelength becomes smaller or larger than the spatial size of the dephased mirror substate .      yet",
    "another decoherence mechanism is through interaction with the environment .",
    "zurek predicted exponential decay of the off - diagonal density matrix element terms for a macroscopic object in a superposition state , @xmath235 $ ] , with time constant @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the thermal relaxation time , @xmath203 is the difference in distance between these two states , and @xmath238 is the thermal de broglie wavelength of the macroscopic object @xcite . the decay is into a mixed rather than a pure state .",
    "it is interesting to note that the lack of interference predicted in section [ subsec : onlyparticle ] also depends on @xmath203 but for very different reasons .    applying this decoherence model to the macroscopic slab states after reflection of the neutron , as described above , yields @xmath239 . for these neutron parameters",
    "this ratio is large ( @xmath240 for @xmath241 kg at @xmath242k ) due to the very small offset introduced from the recoil ( @xmath243 ) .",
    "the parameter of interest , @xmath244 , is also affected by @xmath237 which can vary dramatically depending on environmental and material properties along with the dimensional values of the slab .",
    "mesoscopic masses can have short thermal relaxation times .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that environmental decoherence for reflection from a slab can easily be made negligible in this model of decoherence .    applying this decoherence model to the mesoscopic / macroscopic mirror states during correlated interference in reflection allows a greater variation of parameters since atoms or molecules can more easily reflect from a surface than from both surfaces of a ` thin film . '",
    "the result , @xmath245 , therefore allows environmental decoherence for the mirror to more easily be made either negligible or non - negligible .",
    "consider next the consequences of such decoherence on correlated interference where the particle and mirror are in superposition states of both having and not having reflected .",
    "if this mirror substate decoheres into a mixed state then it seems reasonable to assume that the commensurate particle substate must also decohere into a mixed state since the two substates are correlated via conservation of energy and momentum .",
    "measurement of only the particle , after the mirror has decohered , therefore yields no interference since the particle can not then be in a superposition state .    applying this result to a measurement of only the neutron flux reflecting from the slab , while varying the incident neutron s wavelength , results in no interference if the slab decoheres during the time between reflection from both surfaces .",
    "the details of actually executing such a measurement and of choosing parameters which straddle the region where decoherence is and is not applicable are of course much more complicated and are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "braginsky and khalili also treat environmental decoherence @xcite .",
    "however , they predict that for a macroscopic oscillator to exhibit quantum effects both the mechanical and thermal relaxation times are important while the parameter @xmath203 is not incorporated in their model . they argue that quantum effects can indeed be exhibited for macroscopic high q resonators .",
    "it has been shown that correlated interference in reflection does not disappear with increasing mirror mass , is difficult to eliminate via a path measurement , and can be made insensitive to environmental decoherence .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the robust character of interference for objects with many degrees of freedom is reinforced by measurements which demonstrate that even if the size of the object is larger than both the coherence length and debroglie wavelength , interference can still be observed @xcite .",
    "the use of reflection to generate perceptible interference in a mesoscopic / macroscopic object involves a microscopic particle interacting with a mesoscopic / macroscopic reflector to create two reflector substates which differ only by the microscopic momentum exchanged .",
    "unlike the fringes for a particle traversing a double slit , the interference fringes for the reflector substates do not vanish in the limit of large reflector mass .",
    "in addition , particle and reflector interference is required for conservation of energy and momentum to be satisfied .",
    "for example , consider reflection of a neutron from a slab . `",
    "thin - film ' interference yields peak b in the two - body pdf of fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier_negenergy ] . destructive interference of the reflected neutron substate , which is certainly expected in a one - body treatment , must be associated with destructive interference of the slab substate ( peak b must not exist ) .",
    "that is , if the neutron can not be measured in reflection then the slab can never be measured at the position associated with it either having or not having reflected the neutron .",
    "similarly , by only changing the neutron wavelength to generate constructive thin - film interference in reflection , the slab must then have a commensurate probability to be found in a position of having reflected the neutron .",
    "measurement of interference in the reflected particle then requires that the reflector be in a superposition state which interferes in a manner correlated with that of the particle .",
    "this conclusion also holds for the interference shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interference ] and presumably for all two - body interferometers .",
    "existence of such interference might be disputed since the difference in wavevectors of the interfering mirror substates , due to reflecting a microscopic particle , is much smaller than the spread in wavevectors of which the mirror wavegroup is composed , due to its thermal motion .",
    "this can be expressed as the ratio @xmath246 .",
    "interference , however , is not determined by @xmath247 but rather by the relation between the interferometer path difference and the coherence lengths of the interfering wavegroups . for a neutron reflecting from a mirror of @xmath248 kg , @xmath249 m / s , and @xmath218 k ,",
    "the ratio @xmath250 yields a number which is of the same order of magnitude as is this ratio for an optical pulse of duration @xmath251 s ( from a mode locked ti - sapphire laser ) traversing a mach - zehnder interferometer , with the mirror in one arm moving at speed @xmath252 m / s ( all other interferometer components are static ) .",
    "optical pulse trains exhibit interference in similar interferometers @xcite with smaller @xmath247 values than in the particle reflection example just given .",
    "correlated interference in reflection is an example of one of the simplest interferometers , utilizing neither division of amplitude nor division of wavefront methods to generate interference .",
    "in addition , path lengths need not be carefully matched for interference to be manifest .",
    "the complexity of this interferometer is revealed as the coherence lengths of the particle and mirror substates are varied .",
    "examples are : ( 1 ) when both are small , classical reflection rather than interferometry essentially occurs .",
    "( 2 ) when both are large , compared with the particle s wavelength , reflection becomes an interferometer yielding correlated interference , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spreadvelocity]a , while no interference is observed in a one - body - only measurement of either the particle or mirror . due to uncertainty in the location of both objects ,",
    "a measurement of the particle at @xmath2 then interferometrically correlates with a range of position measurements of the mirror .",
    "( 3 ) when the mirror s displacement , due to recoil in reflection , is less than the mirrors coherence length and the coherence length of the particle is larger than that of the mirror , then a measurement of only the particle yields the expected interference from a one - body schrdinger equation treatment ( an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spreadvelocity]c ) .",
    "( 4 ) when the coherence length of the particle is much larger than that of the mirror and mirror recoil is larger than its coherence length , reflection becomes a two - body beamsplitter .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spreadvelocity]d for @xmath91 . here",
    "two states are generated but do not interfere , one being the particle - mirror state before reflection and the other that after reflection , similar to a beamsplitter producing photon states which traverse spatially separate and therefore distinguishable paths .",
    "for example , at fixed @xmath2 there is a bimodal pdf along the @xmath3 axis , each peak of which corresponds to one of these two states .",
    "there is no interference since the short coherence length of the mirror relative to the recoil distance results in distinguishable two - body states ( the mirror has reflected the particle in the upper but not the lower pdf peak ) .",
    "the kinematics in the correlated interference regime can be compared with that of an electromagnetic wavegroup reflecting classically from a mirror .",
    "the latter involves accelerated motion due to a continuous force delivered to the mirror throughout the reflection process . to determine the former ,",
    "consider the interference region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interference ] with @xmath253 , @xmath254 , and equal coherence lengths . if only the mirror is measured ( integrating the pdf over the particle coordinate ) then the expectation value for the mirrors position accelerates throughout the interaction time , as expected classically .",
    "if the mirror is not measured but the particle is , then the expectation value for the mirrors position decelerates at the same rate .",
    "however , these expectation value kinematics vary with parameters such as particle and mirror substate coherence lengths and masses .",
    "finally , the issue of how to determine that the mirror is in a superposition of states is considered .",
    "one method is to perform a correlation measurement of the positions of the particle and cm of the mirror in the interference region . in a region of destructive interference",
    "neither will be found . however , correlation measurements are difficult to perform .",
    "another possibility is to use a third particle as a probe , interacting only with the mirror to determine if the mirror is in a superposition state , in the following way : let this microscopic probe particle reflect from both mirror states ( reflecting from the other side of the mirror ) resulting in one - body interference of the probe .",
    "the coherence length of the probe need only be larger than the very small displacement of the mirror states for this probe interference to be exhibited , while the magnitude of the phase shift is determined by the mass of the probe .",
    "this is a method to measure that the mesoscopic / macroscopic mirror is in a superposition state , without any direct measurement of the mirror .",
    "however , calculations of such three - body interactions , which follow easily from the formalism discussed above , are beyond the scope of this already lengthy foundational work .    methods to measure quantum effects on a mesoscopic / macroscopic reflector using only the reflected particle have been a focus of this work , rather than the methods just described . the reflected particle flux is then used to reveal properties of the quantum state of the reflector .",
    "one example is of a neutron reflecting from a slab . as with interference in reflection of light ,",
    "the one - body schrdinger equation predicts a variation in reflected neutron flux as a function of incident neutron wavelength whenever the neutron coherence length is longer than the slab thickness .",
    "the calculation presented here , treating both the particle and reflector as quantum objects , also predicts such interference but only as a special case .",
    "in addition , this treatment predicts the following regimes under which no reflected interference occurs _ for a measurement of only the particle _ : ( 1 ) the reflection process acts as a beamsplitter and not an interferometer , generating two mirror or slab states which do not overlap .",
    "( 2 ) the fourier components of the mirror substate have random phases sufficient to extend its size beyond that of the particle s wavelength .",
    "( 3 ) the slab and mirror have coherence lengths long enough for correlated interference but not interference when only the particle is measured .    in each of these cases , consider varying the incident particle s wavelength and observing no interference in the reflected particle flux .",
    "this indicates that the mesoscopic / macroscopic reflector is in a particular quantum superposition state . by varying parameters appropriately , as discussed in section [ sec : particleonlymirror ] , interference in this reflected particle flux then reappears .",
    "ironically , it is this lack of interference that then reveals the quantum nature of this mesoscopic / macroscopic ` thin film ' or mirror . in this case , measuring only the reflected particle flux yields significant experimental advantages over a measurement of the correlation between the particle and mirror .",
    "another possible method to study the state of the mesoscopic / macroscopic mirror is via the expected standing wave pattern generated between incident and retro - reflected states of a bose - einstein condensate as it interacts with a mirror .",
    "if this process can be modeled as described above , with the mass of the condensate replacing that of the particle , then the point at which condensate interference disappears can be extended to larger mirror masses .",
    "although interference between split condensates has been observed @xcite , as far as we are aware , there is no evidence of standing wave interference due to reflection .",
    "reflection of atoms from mirrors has been previously studied but not in treating both the particle and reflector as quantum objects nor in the reflector mass regimes discussed here nor in an attempt to measure either the resulting ` standing - wave ' interference or the effect of decoherence on such interference .",
    "there exist few examples of quantum correlated interference for non - zero rest mass particles .",
    "verification of the above predictions , even in the microscopic regime for both particle and reflector , is therefore of fundamental interest .",
    "although far from being comprehensive , these results indicate a direction , heretofore unexplored , for further research in understanding quantum correlation , probing decoherence , and extending quantum measurements to larger masses .",
